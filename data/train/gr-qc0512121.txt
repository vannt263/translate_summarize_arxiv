    "the pioneer 10/11 missions were the first spacecraft to explore the outer solar system @xcite .",
    "their objectives were to conduct , during the 1972 - 73 jovian opportunities , exploratory investigation beyond the orbit of mars of the interplanetary medium , the nature of the asteroid belt , and the environmental and atmospheric characteristics of jupiter and saturn ( for pioneer 11 ) .",
    "pioneer 10 was launched on 2 march 1972 on top of an atlas / centaur / te364 - 4 launch vehicle .",
    "the launch marked the first use of the atlas - centaur as a three - stage launch vehicle .",
    "the third stage was required to rocket pioneer 10 to the speed of 14.39 km / s needed for the flight to jupiter .    its sister craft , pioneer 11 , was launched on 5 april 1973 , like pioneer 10 , also on top of an atlas / centaur / te364 - 4 launch vehicle . after safe passage through the asteroid belt on 19 april 1974 , pioneer 11 s thrusters were fired to add another 63.7 m / s to the spacecraft s velocity .",
    "this adjusted the aiming point at jupiter to 43,000 km above the cloudtops .",
    "the close approach also allowed the spacecraft to be accelerated by jupiter to a velocity of 48.06 km / s  so that it would be carried across the solar system some 2.4 billion km to saturn .    after the jupiter and saturn ( for pioneer 11 ) encounters ( see figure [ fig : pioneer_inner_path ] ) , the craft followed escape hyperbolic orbits near the plane of the ecliptic on opposite sides of the solar system , continuing their extended missions @xcite .",
    "( see figure [ fig : pioneer_path ] . )",
    "pioneer 10 explored the outer regions of the solar system , studying energetic particles from the sun ( solar wind ) , and cosmic rays entering our portion of the milky way .",
    "pioneer 10 continued to make valuable scientific investigations until its science mission ended on march 31 , 1997 . since that time , pioneer 10 s weak signal has been tracked by the nasa s deep space network ( dsn ) as part of an advanced concept study of communication technology in support of nasa s future interstellar probe mission .",
    "pioneer 10 eventually became the first man - made object to leave the solar system .",
    "the power source on pioneer 10 finally degraded to the point where the signal to earth dropped below the threshold for detection in its latest contact attempt on 7 february , 2003 .",
    "the previous three contacts had very faint signals with no telemetry received .",
    "the last telemetry data point was obtained from pioneer 10 on 27 april 2002 when the craft was 80  au from the sun .    following its encounter with saturn , pioneer 11 explored the outer regions of our solar system , studying the solar wind and cosmic rays .",
    "pioneer 11 sent its last coherent doppler data on 1 october 1990 while at @xmath7 au from the sun . in september 1995 ,",
    "pioneer 11 was at a distance of 6.5 billion km from earth . at that distance",
    ", it takes over 6 hours for the radio signal to reach earth .",
    "however , by september 1995 , pioneer 11 could no longer make any scientific observations . on 30 september 1995 , routine daily mission operations were stopped .",
    "intermittent contact continued until november 1995 , at which time the last communication with pioneer 11 took place .",
    "there has been no communication with pioneer 11 since .",
    "the earth s motion has carried our planet out of the view of the spacecraft antenna .",
    "the spacecraft can not be maneuvered to point back at the earth .",
    "it is not known whether the spacecraft is still transmitting a signal .",
    "no further tracks of pioneer 11 are scheduled .",
    "-10pt    the pioneers were excellent craft for the purposes of precision celestial mechanics experiments @xcite .",
    "this was due to a combination of many factors , including their attitude control ( spin - stabilized , with a minimum number of attitude correction maneuvers using thrusters ) , power design ( the plutonium-238 powered heat - source rtgs ",
    "radioisotope thermoelectric generators ",
    "being on extended booms aided the stability of craft and also reduced thermal effects on the craft ) , and precise doppler tracking ( with the accuracy of post - fit doppler residuals at the level of mhz ) .",
    "the result was the most precise navigation in deep space to date @xcite .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : pio - craft ] for a design drawing of the spacecraft . )    because of the excellent health and navigational capabilities of pioneer 10 , nasa supported a proposal to initiate search for unmodeled accelerations in 1979 ( when the spacecraft was at a distance of some 20 au from the sun ) .",
    "the main motivation was the search for planet x. eventually both pioneers were used in the search for trans - neptunian objects ; their doppler tracking capabilities also yielded the first ever limits on low frequency gravitational radiation @xcite .    the pioneer 10/11 spacecraft had exceptional `` built - in '' acceleration sensitivity naturally allowing them to reach the level of @xmath8 m / s@xmath2 .",
    "as indicated by their radiometric data received from heliocentric distances of 20 - 70 au , the accuracies of their orbit reconstructions were limited by a small , anomalous , doppler frequency drift @xcite . by 1980 , when pioneer 10 already had passed a distance of @xmath9 20 au from the sun and the acceleration contribution from solar radiation pressure on the craft ( away from the sun ) had decreased to less than @xmath10 m / s@xmath2 , the radiometric data started to show presence of the anomalous acceleration ( towards the sun ) .",
    "this blue - shifted drift is uniformly changing with a rate of @xmath11 hz / s , which can be interpreted as a sunward constant acceleration of @xmath12 m / s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the detailed study of this anomaly @xcite led to a better understanding of its properties ( summarized in section  [ sec : anomaly ] ) ; however , the nature of this anomalous signal is still unknown .    in this paper",
    "we are going to discuss recently recovered set of pioneer data and objectives for upcoming new investigation of the anomalous residuals detected in the radiometric doppler data of the pioneers 10 and 11 .",
    "we continue the paper in section  [ sec : anomaly ] by discussing the pioneer anomaly and its known properties .",
    "we briefly review the original efforts to understand the signal as well as some recent proposals to explain the pioneer anomaly .",
    "section  [ sec : pio - doppler ] presents the current status of the effort to retrieve the entire set of the pioneer radiometric doppler data .",
    "section  [ sec : mdr ] reports on the newly recovered pioneer telemetry data in the form of master data records ( mdrs ) .",
    "because of their potentially high value in the investigation of the pioneer anomaly , we discuss the purpose , means of delivery , storage , processing and possible use of the mdrs . in section  [ sec : objectives ] we present objectives for the upcoming study of the pioneer anomaly and particularly the use of both the extended set of doppler data and the mdrs to study the on - board systematics , including the development of an accurate thermal - electric - dynamical model . in section  [ sec : conclude ] we conclude by presenting the next steps for the analysis of the pioneer anomaly .",
    "the analysis of the pioneer 10 and 11 data ( with some support from the ulysses and galileo spacecraft ) @xcite demonstrated the presence of an anomalous , doppler frequency blue shift drift , uniformly changing with a rate of @xmath13  hz / s @xcite . to understand the phenomenology of the effect ,",
    "consider @xmath14 , the frequency of the retransmitted signal observed by a dsn antenna , and @xmath15 , the predicted frequency of that signal modeling conventional forces influencing the spacecraft s motion including both gravitational and non - gravitational in their origin .",

[ 38 ] of @xcite ) .",
    "after accounting for all _ known _ ( not modeled ) sources of systematic error ( discussed in @xcite ) , the conclusion was reached that there exists an anomalous sunward constant acceleration signal of @xmath20 the nature of this anomaly remains unexplained .",
    "this signal has become known as the pioneer anomaly .",
    "note that there exist a dualism in interpreting the radiometric doppler data .",
    "the anomaly can be due to a force acting on the craft that produces acceleration eq .",
    "( [ eq : ap ] ) , or , alternatively , this signal can also be interpreted as a time deceleration uniformly changing with rate @xmath3 s / s@xmath2 ( see discussion of this possibility in @xcite ) .    by now several studies of the pioneer doppler navigational data have demonstrated that the anomaly is unambiguously present for both pioneer 10 and 11 .",
    "these studies were performed with four independent ( and different ! ) navigational computer programs @xcite , namely :    * the jpl s orbit determination program ( odp ) developed in 1980 - 2005 , * the aerospace corporation s chasmp code extended for deep space navigation @xcite , * code written at the goddard space flight center @xcite that was used to analyze pioneer 10 data for the period 1987 - 1994 obtained from the national space science data center ( http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) , and finally * code developed at the institute of theoretical astrophysics , university of oslo , norway , that was recently successfully used to analyze the set of the pioneer 10 data above @xcite .    for the most detailed analysis of the pioneer anomaly to date , @xcite used the following pioneer 10/11 doppler data :    * pioneer 10 : the data set had 20,055 data points obtained between 3 january 1987 and 22 july 1998 and covering heliocentric distances @xmath21  au . * pioneer 11 : the data set had 19,616 data points obtained between 5 january 1987 to 1 october 1990 and covering heliocentric distances @xmath22  au .",
    "the recent analyses of the pioneer 10 and 11 radiometric data @xcite have established the following basic properties of the pioneer anomaly :    * _ distance : _ it is unclear how far out the anomaly goes , but the pioneer 10 data supports its presence at distances up to @xmath970  au from the sun .",
    "the pioneer 11 data shows the presence of the anomaly as close in as @xmath920 au . * _ direction : _ from typical angular uncertainty of doppler navigation at s - band and spacecraft high gain antennae pointing accuracy set within 3  db gain bandwidth , @xmath23 behaves as a line - of - sight constant acceleration of the craft generally pointing in the innermost region of the solar system . * _ constancy : _",
    "both temporal and spatial variations of the anomaly s magnitude are of order 10% for each craft , while formal errors are significantly smaller .",
    "there are other pieces of information obtained from spot analyses @xcite ; they indicate that :    * the anomalous acceleration was present in the pioneer 11 data at shorter distances , as close in as @xmath24 au ( see figures  6 and 7 in @xcite ) . *",
    "the pioneer 11 data also indicated that the anomaly may be much smaller at distances @xmath25  au .",
    "it appears to be amplified ( or turned on ) at a distance of @xmath24 au from the sun .",
    "this is approximately when the craft flew by saturn and entered an hyperbolic , escape trajectory .",
    "this information was used as guidance in investigating the applicability of proposals to explain the pioneer anomaly using both conventional and `` new '' physical mechanisms . in the next section",
    "we briefly review these proposals .",
    "initial announcement of the anomalous acceleration ( e.g. @xcite ) triggered many proposals that invoked various conventional physics mechanisms , all aimed at explaining the origin of the anomaly . finding a systematic origin of the proper magnitude and behavior was the main focus of these proposals , which is yet to be found .",
    "although the most obvious explanation would be that there is a systematic origin to the effect , perhaps generated by the spacecraft themselves from anisotropic heat rejection or propulsive gas leaks , the analysis performed did not find evidence for either of them ; that is , no unambiguous , on - board systematic has been discovered .",
    "this initial search was summarized in @xcite , where possible contributions of various mechanisms to the final solution for @xmath23 were given .",
    "the entire error budget was subdivided in three main types of effects , namely    effects due to sources external to the spacecraft ;    the contribution of on - board systematics , and    computational systematic errors .    in this section",
    ", we present a summary of this earlier work .",
    "the first group of effects includes those external to the spacecraft , such as the solar radiation pressure , effects of the solar wind , and the effect of the solar corona on the propagation of radio wave signals .",
    "@xcite also discuss the influences of the kuiper belt s gravity , galactic gravity , and electromagnetic lorentz forces .",
    "errors in the accepted values of the earth s orientation parameters , precession , and nutation are included in the discussion .",
    "the analysis evaluated the contributions of the mechanical instabilities and the location errors of the dsn antenna structures , the phase stabilities of the dsn antennae and clocks , and effects due to the troposphere and ionosphere .",
    "even though some of these mechanisms are near the limit for contributing to the final error budget , it was found that none of them could explain the behavior of detected signal . moreover , some were three orders of magnitude or more too small . in totality , they were insignificant .",
    "the second group of effects includes those that originated on - board and are tied to well - known sources ; this group , as expected , had the largest impact on the final error . among these effects , the radio beam reaction force produced the largest bias to the result , @xmath26  m / s@xmath2 .",
    "as the force exerted by the radio beam necessarily points away from the earth ( and thus from the sun ) , the correction of the measured data increases the amount of the observed anomalous attractive force and makes the pioneer effect larger .",
    "large uncertainties also came from a conjectured differential emissivity of the radioisotope thermoelectric generators ( rtgs ) , radiative cooling of the spacecraft , and propulsive gas leaks from thrusters of the attitude control system : @xmath27",
    "m / s@xmath2 , @xmath28  m / s@xmath2 , and @xmath29  m / s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the effect due to expelled helium produced within the rtgs was also considered , as well as the small difference in anomaly determinations between the two pioneers .",
    "the effect of rejected thermal radiation was the second largest bias / uncertainty that has been the most critical systematic bias to quantify .",
    "if heat generated by the on - board power sources was asymmetrically reflected by the body of the craft , a fore / aft acceleration could be produced causing the measured anomaly .",
    "the pioneer spacecraft were powered by snap-19 rtgs ( space nuclear ancillary power ) mounted on long extended booms ( designed to protect the on - board electronics from heat and radiation impact ) @xcite . in principle , there was more than enough heat available on the craft to cause the anomaly . however ,",
    "the spacecraft s spin - stabilized attitude control , special design of the rtgs and the length of the rtg booms that resulted in a relatively small spacecraft surface available for the preferential heat rejection significantly minimized the amount of heat for the mechanism to work .",
    "the analysis of the 11.5 years of pioneer doppler data @xcite can only support an effect as large as @xmath30  m / s@xmath2 .    in summary ,",
    "although this group represents conceptually the most likely sources for the anomaly , these mechanisms did not gain enough experimental support . at most one",
    "can obtain @xmath912% of the discovered effect by employing all of these mechanisms .",
    "the possibility exists that a combination of the factors above could amount to the measured effect @xcite , but again , the shortness of the data interval used in the analysis , actual spacecraft design and performance data at hand , and also the complexities of modeling thermal radiative processes on the craft made it difficult to unambiguously support this claim @xcite .",
    "the third group of effects was composed of contributions from computational errors .",
    "the effects in this group dealt with the numerical stability of least - squares estimations , accuracy of consistency / model tests , mismodeling of maneuvers , and the solar corona model used to describe the propagation of radio waves .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the influence of annual / diurnal terms seen in the data on the accuracy of the estimates was all small @xcite . the total uncorrelated error associated with computational systematics",
    "is estimated to be less than @xmath31  m / s@xmath2 .",
    "these three groups of effects exhausted all available conventional explanations for the anomaly .",
    "the inability to explain the pioneer anomaly with conventional physics has led to a significant number of theoretical proposals that use more unusual mechanisms ( more details are in @xcite ) .",
    "the pioneer anomaly is an effect at the limit of what is detectable with radiometric tracking of a deep space probe , but it is huge in physical terms : the anomaly exceeds the corrections to newtonian motion predicted by general relativity by five orders of magnitude ( at 50 au ) . hence",
    ", if the effect is not a result of conventional systematics it would have a considerable impact on our models of fundamental forces , regardless of the anomaly being due to a deceleration of the spacecraft or a blue shift of the radio signal .",
    "attempts to verify the anomaly using other spacecraft proved disappointing .",
    "this is because the voyager , galileo , ulysses , and cassini spacecraft navigation data all have their own individual difficulties for use in an independent test of the anomaly @xcite .",
    "in addition , many of the deep space missions that are currently being considered either may not provide the needed navigational accuracy and trajectory stability sensitive to accelerations of under @xmath32  m / s@xmath2 or else they have significant on - board systematics that mask the anomaly .",
    "a requirement to have an escape hyperbolic trajectory makes a number of other missions @xcite less able to directly test @xmath23 .",
    "although these missions all have excellent scientific goals and technologies , nevertheless , their orbits lend them a less advantageous position to conduct a precise test of the detected anomaly .",
    "a number of alternative ground - based verifications of the anomaly have also been considered ; for example , using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) astrometric observations . however , the trajectories of spacecraft like the pioneers , with small proper motions in the sky , make it presently impossible to use vlbi in accurately isolating an anomalous sunward acceleration of the size of @xmath23 .      efforts to explain the anomaly were originally focused on conventional physics mechanisms generated on - board , such as gas leaks from the propulsion system or a recoil force due to the on - board thermal power inventory .",
    "so far , these mechanisms have been found to be either not strong enough to explain the magnitude of the anomaly or else to exhibit significant temporal or spatial variations contradicting the known properties of the anomaly presented above @xcite .",
    "a number of other conventional physics possibilities have also been addressed . in particular",
    ", it has been proposed that kuiper belt objects or dust could explain the anomaly by    a gravitational acceleration ,    an additional drag force ( resistance ) and    a frequency shift of the radio signals proportional to the distance .",
    "of course , one of the most natural mechanisms to generate a putative physical force is the gravitational attraction due to a known mass distribution in the outer solar system ; for instance , due to kuiper belt objects or dust .",
    "however , possible density distributions for the kuiper belt were studied in @xcite and found to be incompatible with the discovered properties of the anomaly .",
    "even worse , these distributions can not circumvent the constraint from the undisturbed orbits of mars and jupiter @xcite .",
    "the density of dust is not large enough to produce a gravitational acceleration on the order of @xmath23 @xcite and also it varies greatly within the kuiper belt , precluding any constant acceleration .",
    "hence , a gravitational attraction by the kuiper belt can , to a large extent , be ruled out .    also , the data from the inner parts of the solar system taken by the pioneer 10/11 dust detectors favors a spherical distribution of dust over a disk in this inner region .",
    "ulysses and galileo measurements in the inner solar system find very few dust grains in the @xmath33  kg range @xcite .",
    "ir observations rule out more than 0.3 earth mass from kuiper belt dust in the trans - neptunian region .",
    "the resistance caused by the interplanetary dust is too small to provide support for the anomaly @xcite .",
    "any dust - induced frequency shift of the carrier signal is also ruled out .",
    "finally we note that , motivated by the numerical coincidence @xmath34 , where @xmath35 the speed of light and @xmath36 is the hubble constant at the present time , there have been many attempts to explain the anomaly in terms of the expansion of the universe .",
    "@xcite showed that such a mechanism would produce an opposite sign for the effect .",
    "a study of the effect of cosmic acceleration on the radio signals rather than on the spacecraft themselves was also undertaken .",
    "this mechanism might be able to overcome the apparent conflict that @xmath23 presents to modern solar system planetary ephemerides @xcite .",
    "the apparent difficulty to explain the anomaly within standard physics became a motivation to look for `` new physics . ''",
    "so far these attempts have not produced a clearly viable mechanism for the anomaly .",
    "in particular , the physics of mond ( modified newtonian dynamics ) represents an interesting possibility with its phenomenological long - range modification of gravity invoked to explain the rotation curves of galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the numerical value for the mondian acceleration @xmath37 is almost an order of magnitude smaller then @xmath23 and is not likely to be observed on the scales of the solar system .",
    "there is also an attempt to explain the anomaly in the framework of a nonsymmetric gravitational theory @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that a skew - symmetric field with a suitable potential could account for @xmath23 @xcite as well as galaxy and cluster rotation curves .",
    "a modification of the gravitational field equations for a metric gravity field , by introducing a general linear relation between the einstein tensor and the energy - momentum tensor has also been claimed to account for @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "both these approaches are currently being further investigated .",
    "various distributions of dark matter in the solar system have been proposed to explain the anomaly , e.g. , dark matter distributed in the form of a disk in the outer solar system with of a density of @xmath38  kg / m@xmath39 , yielding the wanted effect .",
    "dark matter in the form of `` mirror matter '' @xcite is one example .",
    "however , it would have to be a special smooth distribution of dark matter that is not gravitationally modulated as normal matter so obviously is .",
    "@xcite have shown that a generic scalar field can not explain @xmath23 ; on the other hand they proposed that a non - uniformly coupled scalar might produce the wanted effect .",
    "although braneworld models with large extra dimensions offer a richer phenomenology than standard scalar - tensor theories , it is difficult to find a convincing explanation for the pioneer anomaly @xcite .",
    "other ideas include yukawa - like or higher order corrections to the newtonian potential and a theory of conformal gravity with dynamical mass generation , including the higgs scalar ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we must conclude that there are many interesting ideas proposed to explain the physics of the pioneer anomaly . however , most of them need more work before they can be considered to be viable .",
    "to summarize , the origin of the pioneer anomaly remains unclear .",
    "@xcite have advocated for an analysis of the entire set of existing pioneer doppler data , obtained from launch to the last useful data received from the vehicles .",
    "this data could yield critical new information about the anomaly , especially during the earlier mission phases @xcite .",
    "this led to the initiation of an effort to retrieve the early pioneer data that until recently existed in several places on various obsolete format and media ( e.g. , 9-track and even 7-track magnetic tapes ) .",
    "recovery of radiometric data for a mission operating for more then 30 years is an effort that was never attempted before .",
    "indeed , 30 years is a long time , presenting many unique challenges , including changes in the data formats , navigational software , as well as supporting hardware .",
    "even the dsn configuration had changes  new stations were built , and some stations moved , upgraded and reassigned .",
    "the main asset of the entire mission support ",
    "its people  changed the most . by 2005 all the dsn data formats , navigational software used to support pioneers , all the hardware used to read , write and maintain the data have become obsolete and are no longer operationally supported by existing nasa protocols .    despite the anticipated complexities , the transfer of the available pioneer doppler data to modern media formats had been initiated at jpl in early june 2005 and , as of december 2005 , it is nearing completion . in this section",
    "we discuss the current status of this effort to recover the pioneer 10/11 radiometric doppler data .",
    "doppler data is the measure of the cumulative number of cycles of a spacecraft s carrier frequency received during a user - specified count interval .",
    "the exact precision to which these measurements can be carried out is a function of the received signal strength and station electronics , but it is a small fraction of a cycle .",
    "raw doppler data is generated at the tracking station and delivered via a dsn interface to customers . in order to acquire doppler data ,",
    "the user must provide a reference trajectory and information concerning the spacecraft s rf system to jpl s deep space mission system ( dsms ) , to allow for the generation of pointing and frequency predictions .",
    "the user specified count interval can vary from 0.1 sec to 10 minutes , with count times of 10 to 60 seconds being typical @xcite .",
    "the average rate of change of the cycle count over the count interval expresses a measurement of the average velocity of the spacecraft in the line between the antenna and the spacecraft .",
    "the accuracy of doppler data is quoted in terms of how accurate this velocity measurement is over a 60 second count .",
    "the accuracy of data improves as the square root of the count interval .",
    "-12pt    1 .",
    "_ non - coherent doppler data _ ( also known as one - way or f1 data ) is data received from a spacecraft where the downlink carrier frequency is not based on an uplink signal .",
    "the ability of the tracking station to measure the phase of the received signal is the same for non - coherent versus coherent data types , however the uncertainty in the value of the reference frequency used to generate the carrier is generally the dominant error source .",
    "pioneers provided a significant amount of f1 data that is unfortunately not useful for precision orbit determination .",
    "coherent doppler data _ is received from a spacecraft when the reference frequency of the received carrier signal was based on a transmitted uplink signal from the earth .",
    "this is commonly known as two - way ( or f2 ) data , when the receiving and transmitting ground stations are the same , and three - way ( or f3 ) data , when the transmitting and receiving stations are different .",
    "since the frequency of the original source signal is known , this error source does not affect data accuracy .",
    "the accuracy of this data is a function primarily of the carrier frequency , but is affected by transmission media effects .",
    "the f2 and f3 data are the primary source for the pioneer 10 and 11 orbit determination and were the primary focus of the data recovery efforts .",
    "the pioneers used s - band ( @xmath92.2 ghz ) radio signals to communicate with the nasa deep space network ( dsn ) .",
    "the s - band data is available from 26  m , 70  m , and some 34  m antennas of the dsn complex ( see baseline dsn configuration in the figure  [ fig : pio - radio - science ] ) .",
    "the 1-@xmath40 accuracy of s - band data is approximately 1 mm / s for a 60 second count interval after being calibrated for transmission media effects .",
    "the dominant systematic error that can affect s - band tracking data is ionospheric transmission delays .",
    "when the spacecraft is located angularly close to the sun , with sun - earth - spacecraft angles of less than 10 degrees , degradation of the data accuracy will occur .",
    "s - band data is generally unusable for sun - earth - spacecraft angles of less than 5 degrees .",
    "( see more details on the modern capabilities of the dsn , especially its radio science performance for extracting precision doppler signal demonstrated in @xcite . )",
    "-10pt      the pioneer radiometric data was received by the dsn in `` closed - loop '' mode , i.e. , it was tracked with phase lock loop hardware .",
    "( `` open loop '' data is recorded to tape but not tracked by phase lock loop hardware . )",
    "there are basically two types of data : doppler ( frequency ) and range ( time of flight ) , recorded at the tracking sites of the dsn as a function of ut ground received time @xcite . during their missions , the raw radiometric tracking data from pioneers were received originally in the form of intermediate data record ( idr ) tapes , which were then processed into special binary files called atdfs ( archival tracking data files , see description in @xcite ) , containing doppler data from the standard dsn tracking receivers ( see figure  [ fig : pio - data - format - flow ] ) .",
    "note that the `` closed - loop '' data constitutes the atdfs that were used in @xcite .",
    "after a standard processing at the rmdc ( radio metric data conditioning group ) of jpl s navigation and mission design section , atdfs are transformed into odfs ( orbit data files , see description in @xcite ) .",
    "a program called stripper is used to produce the odfs that are , at this point , the main product that is distributed to the end users for their orbit determination needs ( see more discussion on the conversion process in @xcite ) . at jpl , after yet additional processing , these odfs are used to produce sequentially formatted input / output files in navio format that is used by navigators while working with the jpl orbit determination program .",
    "( note that the navio input / output file format is used only at jpl ; other orbit determination programs convert odfs to their particular formats . )",

    "they are derived from intermediate data records by nav and contain all radiometric measurements received from the dsn station including signal levels ( agc = automatic gain control in dbm ) , antenna pointing angles , frequency ( often referred to simply as `` doppler '' ) , range , and residuals .",
    "doppler data is often used to infer spacecraft radial motion relative to the tracking antenna .",
    "data values in atdfs are reported at rates no higher than 10 per second . during their missions",

    "furthermore , we expected to find data in all possible media formats , including 7-track and 9-track magnetic tapes and also digital records on the rdc system .",

    "the next section summarizes the results of our retrieval efforts .      to recover pioneer radiometric data we first went to the nssdc with a request to provide us with copies of all available navigational data ( idr , atdf , and odf ) for the period 1978 - 1994",

    "the problem was introduced by the process that was used to transfer the data across multiple computer platforms : an additional byte was inserted at record boundaries . in other words , every 8065th byte is a record marker and is not part of the atdf stream .",
    "this problem was first encountered by c. markwardt during his study of the pioneer anomaly @xcite .",

    "when jpl retrieved back the data using ftp , every 8065th byte was removed from the each file record .",
    "the resulting data is good to use .",
    "another data segment retrieved from the nssdc corresponded to the very beginning of the pioneer missions , namely the period @xmath91972 - 1976 ( files were archived by g. null of jpl ) .",
    "unfortunately , it appears that not only are these data files corrupted , but they were also written in a format called `` type-66 '' ( or t66 ) which has not been used at jpl for more than 25 years , which adds unanticipated delay .",

    ", we found spr ( system performance record ) data ( format trk-2 - 15a ) .",
    "the raw spr data format was used to replace the idr format , and it was utilized after 1985 when jpl / nav upgraded the system from univac to dec / vms hardware .",
    "we were fortunate to recover several additional historical atdfs for both pioneers from the rmdc s system archive tapes ( sat ) ( written on 9-track and 4  mm tapes ) .",
    "these files were also added to the overall file inventory .",
    "the resulting atdf and odf retrieval methods are shown in figure  [ fig : recovery - flow - chart ] .",
    "in addition to the data already recovered , we found and recovered some early odf data ( 1973 - 1974 ) that was still available in the personal data archives of our jpl colleagues who worked with pioneer data for other purposes ( e.g. , development of the solar system ephemerides ) .",
    "in fact , we were able to recover several odf files written in the navio input / output form .",
    "these files , obtained from several jpl users , were re - converted back to the odf data format .    finally , we have added the data that was already analyzed by @xcite that corresponds to the period of 1987 - 1998 ( for pioneer 10 ) and 1987 - 1990 ( for pioneer 11 ) .",
    "lastly , we added the most recent data for the period 1998 - 2002 .",

    "this same set will be available for distribution .",
    "the currently available expanded data set includes the following data segments for each spacecraft :    * pioneer 10 : the entire available data set covers mission events from mid-1973 ( including jupiter encounter data ) to the last time a pioneer 10 contact returned telemetry data , 27 april 2002 .",
    "this interval spanned heliocentric distances from @xmath41 au to 87 au .",
    "the total @xmath930-year pioneer 10 data set might have @xmath960,000 data points and is about 20 gb in size .",

    "* pioneer 11 : the entire available data set covers the mission from mid-1974 to late 1994 ( including both jupiter and saturn encounters ) .",
    "this interval spanned heliocentric distances from @xmath94 au to 33  au .",
    "the total @xmath920-year pioneer 11 data set might have @xmath950,000 data points and is about 15 gb in size .",
    "we also have most of the information on maneuvers , spin rate , and initial conditions .    to summarize , there exists @xmath930 years of pioneer 10 and @xmath920 years of pioneer 11 data ,",
    "most of which had never been well studied for our purposes .",
    "we are still trying to increase the percentage of the f2 and f3 doppler data in the overal retreived doppler dataset , as f1 data is useless for our analysis .",
    "for this we are working together with rmdc in an attempt to improve the output of the atdf - to - odf file conversion effort , which we expect to complete by january 2006 . by the same time we also hope to close the t66 issue and prepare all input information critical for the upcoming re - processing of the doppler data for the entire pioneer 10 and 11 trajectories .",
    "to re - process the complete pioneer trajectories , one would first have to ( re)edit and ( re)process the entire data span ( from 1972 to 2002 ) , using the same editing strategy , initial conditions , and parameter estimation and noise propagation algorithms .",
    "one could also process the high rate doppler data ( i.e. , 1 record per second ) that previously was used very little .",
    "the high rate data can be used to better determine a spacecraft s spin rate and also to improve the maneuver data file information .",
    "also , the spin rate change was found to be highly correlated with a small but significant spacecraft - generated force , probably from gas leaks @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can also use the high - rate data to estimate and/or calibrate valve gas leaks and all the maneuvers . note that the use of the spacecraft telemetry data may be critical in addressing this issue ( see discussion of this possibility in section  [ sec : mass - expulsion ] ) .",
    "since the previous analysis @xcite , physical models for the earth s interior and the planetary ephemeris have greatly improved .",
    "this is due to progress in gps- , slr- , llr- and vlbi - enabling technologies , doppler spacecraft tracking , and new radio science data processing algorithms .",
    "one would have to write and/or update existing orbit determination programs using these latest earth models ( adopted by the iers ) and also using the latest planetary ephemeris .",
    "this will improve the solutions for the dsn ground station locations by two orders of magnitude ( 1 cm ) over that of the previous analysis .",
    "additionally , this will allow a better characterization of not only the constant part of any anomalous acceleration , but also of the annual and diurnal terms detected in the pioneer 10 and 11 doppler residuals @xcite .",
    "as pointed out above , we were able to recover almost the entire set of doppler data obtained from both pioneers 10 and 11 .",
    "we were also able to obtain the entire archive of the spacecraft telemetry data in a form called master data records ( mdr ) for both craft . because of their potentially high value in the investigation of the pioneer anomaly , in this section",
    "we discuss the purpose , means of delivery , storage , processing and possible use of the mdrs .",
    "all data received from the pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft by the nasa deep space network ( dsn ) was initially stored in the form of mdrs .",
    "these records contained information about the dsn station and reception characteristics , in addition to the actual , `` raw '' data records themselves , which contained both scientific measurements and engineering telemetry , as received from the spacecraft .",
    "( as an example , figure  [ fig : sensors ] shows locations of several thermal sensors in the spacecraft instrument compartment . )",
    "-10pt    -10pt    normally , mdrs are seen to be of little use once the relevant information is extracted from them .",
    "scientific measurements are extracted , packaged in the appropriate form , and sent to the corresponding experimenters for further processing and evaluation .",
    "engineering telemetry is used by the spacecraft operations team to control and guide the spacecraft .",
    "mdrs are not necessarily considered worth preserving once the scientific data has been extracted , and the engineering telemetry is no longer needed for spacecraft operations .",
    "indeed , the mdr retention schedule prescribed that the tapes be destroyed after 7 years .",
    "fortunately , most of the mdrs for the pioneer 10 and 11 projects have been preserved nevertheless .",
    "long before we ( lrk and vtt ) heard about the pioneer anomaly investigation , we recognized the potential value of the mdrs for educational purposes ; we envisioned an educational web site where a visitor could observe the pioneers as they traveled through the solar system , while viewing telemetry information that showed the health status and operational characteristics of the two spacecraft .",
    "for this reason , lrk endeavored to preserve the complete set of mdrs for the two projects and copied the data to modern media .",
    "meanwhile , vtt began developing pc - based tools for processing the mdrs and extracting information .    far beyond the original expectations ,",
    "this effort is now seen to be of value for the investigation of the pioneer anomaly , as the mdrs , specifically the telemetry data contained therein , may help in the construction of an accurate model of the spacecraft during their decades long journey , including a precise thermal profile , the time history of propulsion system activation and usage , and many other potential sources of on - board disturbances .      in the early days of pioneer operations , the original mdrs for the pioneer 10 and 11 missions",
    "were copied to magnetic tape at the dsn receiving stations , and then sent to the appropriate nasa office for further processing .    after more than 20 years of storage ,",
    "the medium started to show signs of deterioration and all of the recoverable raw data was copied to 128 megabyte magneto - optical ( `` floptical '' ) disks .",
    "these disks were readable by a microvax using a digital corporation rwz21 magneto optical scsi disk drive .",
    "digital corporation is now part of compaq , the available vax 4000 - 300 computer will soon cease to exist , and the scsi rwz21 drives will not be usable to read these `` floptical '' disks .    at present ,",
    "a near complete set of mdr `` floptical '' disks still exists , along with equipment capable of reading this media . during the course of 2004 and 2005",
    ", kellogg has copied the files from `` floptical '' disks to a modern computer , and also created dvd - roms for distribution .",
    "the contents of the available mdr disks can be summarized as follows :    pioneer 10 : 155 disks x 128 mb ( 16.33 gb ) + pioneer 11 : 217 disks x 128 mb ( 23.01 gb )    all mdr files are named using a common naming convention .",
    "each file contains the mdrs for one spacecraft for an entire day .",
    "the file name begins with the letter ` m ' , followed by a two - digit spacecraft identifier ( 23 for pioneer 10 , 24 for pioneer 11 ) , and a 5-digit date ( 2 digits for the year , 3-digit doy . )",
    "the filename extension is .mdr .",
    "thus , m2495003.mdr , for instance , would be the name of the pioneer 11 file for january 3 , 1995 .    when kellogg copied the files to modern computers , he established a separate directory for each `` floptical '' disk copied .",
    "he also used a consistent naming convention : the directory name began with the two - digit spacecraft identifier , followed by the letter ` p ' , a two - digit year value , and a two - digit sequence number that simply identified the number of the disk for the given year .",
    "so for instance , 23p9602 would be disk 2 for pioneer 10 , for the year 1996 .",
    "the total amount of data stored in these mdr files is approximately 40  gb . according to the original log sheets that record the transcription from tape to `` floptical '' media , only a few days worth of data is missing , some due to magnetic tape damage .",
    "one notable exception is the `` jupiter encounter period '' of pioneer 10 . according to the transcription log sheets ,",
    "doy 332 - 341 from 1973 were not available at the time the `` floptical '' disks were made .",
    "kellogg s investigation revealed that the tapes in question may have been misplaced long before the transcription has taken place .",
    "unfortunately , it is unlikely that those tapes will ever be located , and even if they re found , chances are that they will no longer be readable due to media deterioration .",
    "other significant periods of missing data are listed in table [ tb : missing_mdr ] .",
    "it is not known why these records are not present , except that we know that very few days are missing due to unreadable media ( i.e. , the cause is missing , not damaged , tapes . )",

    "we see this as the main challenge of the upcoming analysis . how to convincingly use a reading at several points on the craft to reconstruct the heat dynamics ?",
    "( similar questions exist for gas leaks and all other parameters . )",
    "if we do nt see their signature in the doppler signal , we should be able to put an upper limit on the potential contribution from these sources to the pioneer anomaly .",
    "similarly , the temperature data in the mdrs must put an upper limit on the changes of the optical surfaces of the rtgs ( i.e. their emissivity and reflectivity ) .",
    "because of the complexities involved , clearly more resources are needed ; we invite researchers to join us for this part of the upcoming study .",
    "another suggestion related to the rtgs is based on the idea that during the early parts of the missions , there might have been a differential change of the radiant emissivity of the sun - pointing sides of the rtgs as compared to the sides facing deep space .",
    "note that , especially closer to the sun , the inner sides were subjected to the solar wind . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer sides were sweeping through the solar system dust cloud .",
    "these two processes could result in different levels of degradation of the optical surfaces of the rtgs . in turn",
    "this degradation could result in asymmetric patterns of heat radiation away from the rtgs in the fore / aft directions along the spin axis .",
    "therefore , it can be argued that such an anisotropy may have caused the anomaly . using the actual design information on the rtgs and a sophisticated model of the fin structure ,",
    "@xcite estimate an upper limit of 6.12w to be the uncertainty in the contribution from the differential emissivity of the rtgs to the anomalous acceleration of the craft .",
    "this value , in turn , results in an acceleration uncertainty of @xmath42 the authors also point out the significance of radioactive decay for this mechanism and especially its expected contribution to the decrease of the magnitude of @xmath23 , which has not been observed .    the effect of the radioactive decay on the thermal output of the rtgs can be directly observed from telemetry .",
    "all rtgs had a temperature sensor located at the root of one of the radiating fins ( `` fin root temperature '' ) .",
    "preliminary analysis suggests that these readings are in agreement with what would be expected from the radioactive decay of the plutonium fuel ( see figure  [ fig : root - fin ] ) .",
    "one can try to detect changes in the measurements of fin root temperature during each of the three planetary encounters and see if the rtgs had developed an anisotropic radiating pattern .",
    "( note that the same test can be conducted for the electrical energy dissipation . )",
    "thus , if the temperatures at the fins change during the fly - bys , this may indirectly indicate an alteration of the optical properties of the rtgs during the planetary encounters .",
    "this should allow us to ask the question : `` if the system survived flawlessly than why would it change long after the encounter ? ''",
    "one can also look at the different segments of the thermal history in an attempt to identify different heat decay rates .",
    "however , the planetary flybys might be the strongest test for the system s design and operational longevity .",
    "if the mechanisms above were treated as separate constituents to the anomalous accelerations , one can ask what if a combination of them is responsible for the effect .",
    "it has been recently suggested that most , if not all , of the unmodeled acceleration of pioneer 10 and 11 is due to an essentially constant supply of heat coming from the central compartment , directed out the front of the craft through the closed louvers @xcite .",
    "this is a more subtle version of an earlier proposal @xcite calling on the total electrical power as a mechanism . that proposal was argued against because of the observed lack of decay of the acceleration with time @xcite .    for this mechanism to work , one essentially needs to find a constant supply of heat radiated off the back of the spacecraft that would produce a thermal recoil force with the well established properties ( discussed in section  [ sec : anomaly ] ) .",
    "however , the assumption of constancy came against the actual design of the pioneers and experimental data on the performance of the vehicles @xcite .",
    "in fact , the lack of constancy of heat dissipated during the longest doppler segment analyses ( i.e. 11.5 years of the pioneer 10 data ) invalidated the hypothesis . however , this claim can and will be further investigated with the newly recovered data , both doppler and telemetry ( see tables  [ tab : telemetry],[tb : power ] ) .    the newly acquired data ( both doppler and telemetry ) can significantly contribute to addressing this possibility .",
    "for one , we also have a much larger segment of doppler data that will be used to analyze these heat dissipation processes on the vehicles .",
    "in addition , we now have the actual design , fabrication , testing , pre- and in - flight calibration data that characterize the pioneer craft performance for the duration of their missions .",
    "this data can tell precisely at what time the louvers were open and closed , when a certain instrument was powered on and off , what was the performance of the battery , shunt current and all electric parts of the spacecraft .",
    "this is truly a unique data set that will be used to reconstruct the physics of the anomalous acceleration , if it is due to on - board systematics .",
    "in fact we have all the detailed information on properties of the spacecraft and the data needed to reconstruct the behavior of its major components , including electrical power and thermal subsystems .",
    "this information may be used in developing a thermodynamical model of the spacecraft that would help us to establish the true thermal and electrical power dissipation history of the vehicles and also correlate major events on the pioneers ( such as powering `` on '' or `` off '' certain instruments or performing a maneuver ) with the available doppler data ; this possibility is addressed in section  [ sec : thermal - model ] .",
    "another possible on - board systematic error may be coming from the expulsion of the he being created in the rtgs from the @xmath43-decay of @xmath44pu ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the pioneer rtgs were designed so that the he pressure is not totally contained within the pioneer heat source over the life of the rtgs .",
    "instead , the pioneer heat source contains a pressure relief device that allows the generated he to vent out of the heat source and into the thermoelectric converter .",
    "the thermoelectric converter housing - to - power output receptacle interface is sealed with a viton o - ring .",
    "the o - ring allows the helium gas within the converter to be released by permeation into the space environment throughout the mission life of the pioneer rtgs .    for this mechanism to work",
    ", what one needs is all he produced to preferentially leave the rtgs in one direction at a rate of 0.77g / yr . assuming a single elastic reflection , @xcite ruled out helium permeating through the o - rings as the cause of @xmath23 .",
    "they also give the estimate for acceleration contribution in the direction away from the sun due to this systematic expulsion @xmath45    it is highly unlikely that this mechanism is responsible for the pioneer anomaly seen on both spacecraft ; the use of mdrs can further support this conclusion .",
    "the possible use of a similar strategy to the above to study the effect of propulsive mass expulsion due to gas leakage has to be assessed .",
    "it is known that , although this effect is largely unpredictable , many spacecraft have experienced gas leaks producing accelerations on the order of @xmath46m / s@xmath2 .",
    "gas leaks generally behave differently after each maneuver .",
    "the leakage often decreases with time and becomes negligible .",
    "( see more discussion of these effects in @xcite . )    -6pt    -5pt    -6pt    -5pt    -6pt    -5pt    gas leaks can originate from the pioneers propulsion system , which is used for mid - course trajectory maneuvers , for spinning up or down the spacecraft , and for orientation of the spinning spacecraft .",
    "( consult @xcite for design of the pioneer propulsion and attitude control systems . ) by studying time histories of the spin rates of the pioneers , @xcite estimated the effect of the gas leakage mechanism on the anomalous acceleration .",
    "this mechanism was found to produce an acceleration uncertainty of @xmath47 furthermore , they concluded that the gas leak mechanism is very unlikely to be the explanation for the anomalous acceleration .",
    "this is because it is difficult to understand why this effect , being a stochastic variable obeying a poisson distribution , would affect pioneers 10 and 11 by the same amount @xcite .",
    "the new analysis can refine the conclusions above .",
    "we have three readings from the propellant tank on board that can help establish the propellant loss history of the two spacecraft , namely propellant tank temperature ( figure  [ fig : thrusters - c-130 ] ) , propellant supply pressure ( figure  [ fig : thrusters - c-210 ] ) , and propellant supply temperature ( figure  [ fig : thrusters - c-327 ] ) .",
    "we also have several temperature readings from the thruster clusters and individual thrusters . not only may this new information be used to precisely establish the time of the maneuvers",
    ", it can also provide some insight as to why the two identically designed systems behaved so differently , especially when changes to their spin rates are concerned ( see figures 11 and 12 of @xcite . )",
    "the corresponding analysis had been initiated and results will be reported .      in this section",
    "we will argue that , based on the information provided by the mdrs , one can develop a high accuracy thermal / electrical / dynamical model of the pioneer spacecraft .",
    "such a model can be used to further improve our understanding of the anomalous acceleration and especially to study contribution from the on - board thermal environment to the anomaly . in this section",
    "we will comment on our preliminary evaluation of what is needed to develop such an accurate model .",
    "it is clear that a thermal model for the pioneers spacecraft would have to account for all heat radiation within the spacecraft and out to deep space .",
    "specifically , this model would have start from the rtgs and include description of the heat radiated , absorbed , reradiated , and conducted by each and every instrument , all cables , support structures and etc .",
    "the objective is to develop a broadband ( ir and optical ) thermal map of the spacecraft s exterior , accurate to few degrees kelvin . as input",
    ", this model will use electrical telemetry readings from the on - board sensors that were installed on the spacecraft , while temperature readings ( see figure  [ fig : sensors ] ) can be used for its calibration .",
    "we will then attempt to verify this model by using the radiometric doppler data from the attitude maneuvers performed at the earlier mission phases .",
    "it is worth noting that no other mission in the past used telemetry data to improve its navigational capabilities ; what we are going to implement with the pioneers is a novel navigational technique .",
    "pioneer 10/11 may be the first missions to benefit from this technique , designed to reduce the impact of on - board sources to non - gravitational accelerations on the accuracy of trajectory reconstruction .",
    "our proposal uses the fact that the pioneers already have very good `` built - in '' navigational capabilities ( i.e. guidance , navigation and control ) ; our goal is to reach the absolute limit allowed by these capabilities . as a quantitative objective , we hope to improve acceleration contribution due to on - board systematic sources to the level below @xmath48 m / s@xmath2 . to reach the stated level of accuracy , one would have to adjust navigational data by using the developed thermal / electrical / dynamical model of the spacecraft . to achieve this",
    "we will utilize the following available information :    1 .",
    "dynamical properties of the spacecraft , i.e. geometry , dimensions , and weights of all the components of the spacecraft , including cabling , fuel and thermal blankets . in short",
    ", we will need to have precise mass and power budget data for the entire craft .",
    "ideally , we would prefer to use not only design numbers , but rather actual values established during the final pre - launch tests at the kennedy space center , florida ( ksc ) .",
    "this information is still to be identified and retrieved .",
    "2 .   thermal , electric and optical ( infrared ) properties of the spacecraft materials used to fabricate all major components of the spacecraft , including thermal blankets and cabling .",
    "again , we would prefer to have these values from the tests at the ksc .",
    "note that we will have access to the initial values of these parameters ; their degradation during the 30 years in space is unknown .",
    "there is very limited information available from long - term exposure tests .",
    "furthermore , for obvious reasons ( tests conducted in a different environment , e.g. , in low earth orbit ( loe ) , for different durations ) , even these results will not be directly applicable to our model .",
    "3 .   we will benefit from the design information of the spacecraft , especially information concerning their thermal , power , propulsion , and communication subsystems .",
    "we will use the knowledge on the location of each and every telemetry sensor placed on the spacecraft and use all the recently retrieved pioneer telemetry data .",
    "this information will be used to build and calibrate the thermal model of the spacecraft . in particular",
    ", the following telemetry information will be critical for the upcoming investigation : 1 .",
    "rtg fin root temperature , as an indicator of rtg thermal output 2 .",
    "rtg current and voltage , providing a measure for total electrical power 3 .   all thermal data from sensors on the spacecraft and instrument compartment 4 .",
    "temperatures and pulse counts from thruster cluster assemblies 5 .",
    "battery current and temperature 6 .",
    "shunt current 7 .",
    "radio beam gain and transmitted power , twt amplifier temperature 8 .",
    "propellant tank and supply lines temperature 4 .",
    "we would have to analyze the design and thermal properties of the snap-19 rtgs used in the pioneers .",
    "much information is already available , but additional data on their thermal behavior will be very helpful in building a 3-dimensional thermal radiation pattern .",
    "once the thermal model is completed , it must be calibrated for in - flight conditions .",
    "for this , we may need to analyze all the attitude control ( i.e.  conscan ) maneuvers in the earlier mission phases @xcite .",
    "the earlier phases had significant variations in the sun - earth line to spin axis angle .",
    "these variations will help us to calibrate the effect of thermal recoil forces on the radiometric data received from the craft and , thus , to precisely evaluate the magnitude of the thermal recoil force .",
    "the closer the craft to the earth is , the better the ultimate accuracy of the model will be .",
    "this is due to the fact that we know the properties of the solar radiation and thermal environment in the inner solar system to a much better accuracy than in the deep space . in fact , it will be hard to do the required calibration after the jupiter flyby , and it will be impossible at distances greater than 10 au . clearly we will benefit from the larger size of the earth - probe - sun angle , which is getting much smaller after 10 au .",
    "after 20 au , both the sun and the earth will be in the same field of view , making it difficult to decouple any thermally induced force from other physical effects .",
    "however , given the significant uncertainties on the degradation of the thermodynamical and optical properties of the materials used to build the pioneers , the outcome of this model is difficult to predict .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that , given the simplicity of the pioneers design , one should be able to build a model with an uncertainty of no more than 15% .",
    "we have initiated this work with anticipated involvement of several navigational and thermal engineers at jpl ; results of this work will be reported .",
    "the plan outlined here is ambitious .",
    "before we embark on this complex exercise , we shall also attempt to build a simpler ( but enthusiastically not `` simplistic '' ) thermal model of the pioneers based on available telemetry data .",
    "such a model would necessarily utilize simplifying assumptions on the spacecraft s geometry , and ignore contributions from small components ( e.g. , structural elements , struts , cables as heat sources ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that even such a model may lead to a much better understanding of the contribution of spacecraft systematics to the anomalous acceleration , and may also guide us to better direct our efforts as we carry out a more elaborate effort .",
    "on march 2 , 2002 nasa s dsn made the last contact with pioneer 10 and confirmed that the spacecraft was still operational thirty years after its launch on march 3 , 1972 ( ut ) .",
    "the uplink signal was transmitted on march 1 from the dsn s goldstone , california facility and a downlink response was received twenty - two hours later by the 70-meter antenna at madrid , spain . at this time the spacecraft was 11.9 billion kilometers from earth at about 79.9 au from the sun and heading outward into interstellar space in the general direction of aldebaran at a distance of about 68 light years from the earth , and a travel time of two million years .",
    "although science operations were officially terminated on march 31 , 1997 , pioneer s onboard rtgs still provided just enough electrical power for operations of the radio transmitter and receiver systems and for the geiger tube telescope experiment of the university of iowa .",
    "after 1997 , nasa arc continued to support occasional tracking of pioneer 10 for development and testing of communications technology that might be used for a future interstellar probe mission .",
    "pioneer 10 s signal was also used as a standard test source for seti radio telescope studies ( i.e. project phoenix , see details at http://www.seti.org/ ) .    by 2005 ,",
    "the existence of the pioneer anomaly is no longer in doubt .",
    "further , after much understandable hesitancy , a steadily growing part of the community has concluded that the anomaly should be subject to further investigation and interpretation .",
    "the results of the investigation of the pioneer anomaly would be win - win ; improved navigational protocols for deep space at the least , exciting new physics at the best . a strong international collaboration ( e.g. , http://www.issi.unibe.ch/teams/pioneer/ ) that extends in broader areas of fundamental physics , technology and mission design",
    "is an additional outcome of the discussed program of the study of the pioneer anomaly @xcite .",
    "concluding , we would like to emphasize one immediate impact of the study of the pioneer anomaly , this time on the pioneer 10 mission itself .",
    "recently it became clear that there exists one last opportunity to contact pioneer 10 in the deep space .",
    "specifically , in february - march 2006 , the mutual motions of the earth and the spacecraft will again put the earth in the field of view of pioneer 10 s antenna , thus making it possible to establish a radio contact with the craft . at this time",
    ", pioneer 10 will be at a heliocentric distance of @xmath990.1  au , moving at a speed of nearly 12.1 km / s with round trip light time from the earth of almost 25 hours ( thus , the same dsn antenna , dss 14 at goldstone , is planned for the operations . )",
    "this would be the last time when dsn will initiate contact with pioneer 10 , as the on - board power system on the craft is at its limits .",
    "this intriguing possibility to re - acquire a coherent doppler signal from pioneer 10 is currently being investigated at jpl and results will be reported .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to our many colleagues who have either collaborated with us on this manuscript or given us their wisdom .",
    "firstly we must acknowledge the many people who have helped us with suggestions , comments , and constructive criticisms .",
    "we specifically thank john  d. anderson , sami asmar , and timothy p. mcelrath , who provided us with very valuable comments while this manuscript was in preparation .",
