    "<S> the existence of current - time universe s acceleration is usually modeled by means of two main strategies . </S>",
    "<S> the first makes use of a dark energy barotropic fluid entering _ by hand _ the energy - momentum tensor of einstein s theory . </S>",
    "<S> the second lies on extending the hilbert - einstein action giving rise to the class of extended theories of gravity . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a third approach , derived as an intrinsic geometrical effect of space - time , which provides repulsive regions under certain circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the effects of repulsive gravity naturally emerge in the field of a homogeneous and isotropic universe . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we use an invariant definition of repulsive gravity based upon the behavior of the curvature eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that repulsive gravity counterbalances the standard gravitational attraction influencing both late and early times of the universe evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon leads to the present speed up and to the fast expansion due to the inflationary epoch . in so doing , we are able to unify both dark energy and inflation in a single scheme , showing that the universe changes its dynamics when @xmath0 , at the repulsion onset time where this condition is satisfied </S>",
    "<S> further , we argue that the spatial scalar curvature can be taken as vanishing because it does not affect at all the emergence of repulsive gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we check the goodness of our approach through two cosmological fits involving the most recent union 2.1 supernova compilation .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ introduction ] ] * _ introduction _ * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    general relativity predicts a universe characterized by a decelerated expansion , if only dark matter and baryons are involved within the energy - momentum tensor . </S>",
    "<S> observations , however , predict a late - time accelerated universe , pushed up by some sort of exotic constituent whose nature is today unknown @xcite . to account for this experimental fact , </S>",
    "<S> cosmologists employ in general two different strategies . </S>",
    "<S> the first one consists in extending the hilbert - einstein action , modifying general relativity by means of additional degrees of freedom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second one takes into account an additional fluid , dubbed _ dark energy _ , which enters einstein s equations and represents a source for the cosmic speed up @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both those treatments are based on the hypothesis that space - time geometry is _ fueled _ by components entering the energy - momentum tensor @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a way , the energy - momentum tensor becomes the source for gravitation and modifies the geometry itself . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we rewrite einstein s equations in an equivalent way as @xmath2 , it is possible to reverse the interpretation of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one can address a dynamical problem by considering an energy - momentum tensor induced by geometry , and not _ vice - versa_. the philosophy is completely different from the one used in higher - order theories of gravity , since no extensions are required , but only a physical mechanism inside the einstein equations themselves , providing a _ </S>",
    "<S> geometrical source term_.    it is therefore possible to imagine that under certain circumstances the geometry could correspond to a repulsive field that counterbalances the attraction of gravity and induces an accelerated universe . </S>",
    "<S> this _ third way _ of handling the universe dynamics becomes a natural consequence of general relativity itself , instead of a new additional ingredient that must be added into the energy - momentum tensor . </S>",
    "<S> indications of repulsive effects in gravity are not new , specially in the case of naked singularities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several intuitive approaches have been proposed to understand repulsive gravity , but only recently an invariant definition in terms of geometric objects was formulated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it was shown that the behavior of the curvature tensor eigenvalues can be used to find the places where repulsive gravity appears . </S>",
    "<S> this was explicitly shown in the case of naked singularities with black hole counterparts where it was found that there exists a repulsion region which is always situated very close to the source of gravity .    here , we extend this approach to the case of a homogeneous and isotropic universe , modeled by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the effects of repulsive gravity as a source for the cosmic speed up , and find the stage at which the universe starts accelerating , corresponding to a phase in which repulsive gravity dominates over attraction . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore interpret the acceleration of the universe in terms of a natural outcome due to the non - linearity of large - scale cosmology which is reflected in the eigenvalues of the curvature tensor . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize gravitational repulsion by evaluating precise values for the observable acceleration parameter @xmath3 and its variation @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the universe dynamics does not depend upon the scalar curvature ; interestingly , this could be interpreted as an explanation of the experimental evidence for that the universe appears spatially flat at all stages of its evolution , and enables us to unify the inflationary phase with the accelerated phase in a single description . finally , we find an approximate effective density induced by repulsive gravity , assuming that the conditions valid at the moment of the repulsion onset continue holding at all times . </S>",
    "<S> we check the goodness of our approach through a numerical test based on supernova union 2.1 data , performed on a grid in which all cosmic parameters evolve . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , we employ two hierarchical experimental tests . in the first one , we take all coefficients free to span in allowed prior domains . in the second one </S>",
    "<S> , we fix the acceleration parameter by means of the most recent planck results . </S>",
    "<S> we definitively show compatible limits between our theoretical predictions and numerical outcomes .    </S>",

    "<S> the idea is that the curvature tensor eigenvalues contain in an invariant manner all the information about the behavior of gravity . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , it is convenient to introduce an orthonormal frame @xmath5 which represents the simplest choice for an observer to perform local time , space and gravity measurements so that all the quantities related to this frame are coordinate independent . </S>",
    "<S> the orthonormal tetrad is determined by the relationships @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the first and second cartan equations enables one to compute explicitly the riemann curvature components in this frame .    for the analysis of the eigenvalues it is convenient to consider the bivector representation of the riemann tensor , which is also useful for finding its irreducible representation with respect to the lorentz group . </S>",
    "<S> we use the notations and conventions introduced in @xcite , according to which each bivector index @xmath9 corresponds to two tetrad indices , i.e. , @xmath10 , with the convention @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the curvature tensor can be expressed as a @xmath12matrix which , in the case of the frw orthonormal frame @xmath13 , reduces to the diagonal matrix @xmath14 @xmath15 where we have used the friedmann equations and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> it then follows that the only independent eigenvalues of the curvature tensor are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    according to our invariant definition of repulsive gravity @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the curvature eigenvalues reflect the behavior of the gravitational interaction and if gravity becomes repulsive in some regions , the eigenvalues must change accordingly ; for instance , if repulsive gravity becomes dominant at a particular point , one would expect at that point a change in the sign of at least one eigenvalue . moreover , if the gravitational field does not diverge at infinity , the eigenvalue must have an extremal at some point before it changes its sign . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the extremal of the eigenvalue can be interpreted as the onset of repulsion .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the eigenvalues of the frw curvature tensor . </S>",
    "<S> first , we note that @xmath18 is positive definite by virtue of the energy conditions and so it does not contain any information about repulsive gravity . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore represents a constraint eigenvalue which fixes the total energy budget pushing up the universe , but with no information on its evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> instead , @xmath17 can change its sign in the interval where the pressure @xmath19 is negative and , so , the universe can accelerate . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath17 represents the dynamical eigenvalue which dominates the spacetime dynamics , predicting the acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath17 does not depend explicitly on the value of the constant @xmath20 which is the first interesting consequence of our approach . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this means that the universe does not need scalar curvature to accelerate so that the curvature density @xmath21 can be taken arbitrarily small , without affecting the universe dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this theoretical result is in agreement with observations @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , this could be considered as a theoretical explanation of the spatial flatness of the universe .    to further analyze the repulsive effects in the dynamics of our the universe </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the acceleration parameter @xcite @xmath22 to obtain @xmath23 so that @xmath24 when the universe is accelerating , whereas for @xmath25 the universe decelerates . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath26 determines the special point @xmath27 at which the acceleration parameter vanishes and the universe undergoes a transition from a decelerating phase into an accelerating phase . </S>",
    "<S> the particular time @xmath28 at which this phase transition occurs follows from the integration of eq . </S>",

    "<S> then , using eq . </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the onset condition @xmath37 using the identity @xcite @xmath38 where the jerk parameter @xmath39 determines the change of the acceleration @xcite , the repulsion onset condition ( [ versotra ] ) reduces to @xmath40 implying that at that moment of time @xmath41 the jerk must be positive because the onset happens when the universe is still decelerating @xmath42 . by using the definitions of the cosmographic parameters , </S>",

    "<S> this is the behavior of the hubble parameter at the onset of repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> from that point on , the value of the acceleration parameter @xmath3 diminishes until it vanishes at @xmath28 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figura2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it seems reasonable to construct a cosmological model based upon the behavior of the hubble parameter near the repulsion onset point ( [ hrep ] ) , where the acceleration begins to play an important role in the universe dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , one expects acceleration to be important in late and early phases of the universe evolution . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we can assume that eq.([hrep ] ) is valid from the transition time up to @xmath47 and also during the inflationary phase .    </S>",

    "<S> we also took into account the slow - roll approximation @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the time at which inflation occurred . </S>",
    "<S> those relations impose bounds on @xmath45 and @xmath46 at the times in which the universe accelerated . in other words , the mechanism of acceleration </S>",
