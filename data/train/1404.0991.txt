    "<S> our calculations are compared to new measurements up to 92 t.    triangular lattice antiferromagnets ( tla ) are widely studied in the field of frustrated magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> complex orderings and rich phase diagrams arise because three antiferromagnetic interactions within a triangle can not be simultaneously satisfied . </S>",

    "<S> the proper - screw spiral induces an electric polarization @xmath7 along the spiral propagation vector .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this allows us to probe phase transitions between spiral states at high applied magnetic fields @xmath8 , while the magnetization is largely insensitive to these transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the non - zero @xmath7 is consistent with arima s mechanism for multiferroic behavior ,  @xcite where the spiral magnetic structure slightly influences the hybridization between the cr @xmath9-orbitals and the o @xmath10-orbitals via spin - orbit coupling , creating a net @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a pattern of electromagnetic domains forms below the magnetic ordering temperature that can be influenced by small electric and magnetic fields relative to the dominant exchange interactions . @xcite    the triangular layers of cucro@xmath1 stack along the @xmath12-axis such that a cr@xmath2 ion from one layer lies at the center of a triangle of cr@xmath2 ions in the next layer .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite for applied magnetic fields along [ 110 ] and @xmath19 t , the proper screw spiral flops into a cycloidal spiral with the same @xmath20 vector .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite since there are six possible domains with different spiral propagation axes , the flop only occurs in the two domains that have their propagation axis perpendicular to the applied magnetic field . during the spin flop </S>",
    "<S> , the electric polarization of those domains rotates from being perpendicular to being parallel to @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this cycloidal spiral phase persists beyond 65 t.  @xcite while the phase diagram for @xmath21 contains only one phase transition at 5.3 t ( in the explored region of phase space up to 65 t ) , the phase diagram for @xmath22 contains a series of field - induced phases .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite here we present a minimal model that applies to @xmath0 , along with new measurements of @xmath7 in cucro@xmath1 up to 92 t. our monte carlo ( mc ) simulations reproduce the zero - field spiral magnetic order and capture the essentials of the field - induced phase diagrams along different magnetic field directions . </S>",
    "<S> four key competing ingredients are important in this problem : frustration , thermal fluctuations , spatially anisotropic exchange interactions and spin anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> although the spin anisotropy and spatial distortion are weak , they are always relevant perturbations because the ground state of the frustrated heisenberg model is highly degenerate .    </S>",

    "<S> the y and umbrella states have the same energy in absence of spatial and spin anisotropies regardless of the field value . because thermal fluctuations favor collinear or coplanar states ,  @xcite the y state is selected at finite @xmath25 . for @xmath80 , </S>",
    "<S> the umbrella state has higher magnetic susceptibility : @xmath81 . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , the intermediate icu phase ( cycloidal spiral ) should produce a rather different value of @xmath7 because the magneto - electric coupling has a different origin .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this result is consistent with our measured @xmath23-dependence of @xmath7 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f5 ] .    </S>",

    "<S> our simple 2d model reproduces the incommensurate proper - screw spiral observed in experiments ,  @xcite and the phase transition to an incommensurate cycloidal spiral observed for @xmath21 . </S>",
