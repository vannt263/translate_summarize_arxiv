    "in the context of the quantum free particle , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , which are also eigenstates of the momentum operator , are not normalizable . these states , the plane waves , are fully delocalized . however , it is customary to expand any normalizable solution of the free , time - dependent , schrdinger equation in terms of plane waves , using the fourier transform , building in this way wave packets which represent localized solutions and that are no longer eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "the simplest examples are the gaussian wave packets , which have the property of minimizing the uncertainty relations between the position and the momentum operator .    in @xcite a transformation",
    "was proposed that maps states and operators from certain quantum systems to the free particle .",
    "this transformation is the quantum version of the arnold transform ( qat ) , which in its original classical version @xcite maps solutions of a certain type of classical equation of motion , a nonhomogeneous linear second order ordinary differential equation ( lsode ) , to solutions of the classical equation for the free particle .    in this paper",
    "we construct different families of states in the space of solutions of the quantum free particle which are the image under the qat of the corresponding families in the quantum harmonic oscillator . among them",
    ", we provide discrete bases of free particle states mapped from the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "they are not eigenstates of the free particle hamiltonian , i.e. they are not stationary states , but , rather , eigenfunctions of a certain quadratic operator @xmath0 with discrete eigenvalues .",
    "the first states of these bases are gaussian wave packets , and are localized with arbitrary initial size , related to the oscillator frequencies and chosen at will , and have initial minimal uncertainties .",
    "the following ones are `` multi - localized '' in the sense that , for instance , in one dimension the @xmath1-order state presents @xmath2 zeros and @xmath3 humps which spread out with time .",
    "this mimics the situation for the harmonic oscillator to such an extent that , in one dimension , it is possible to build creation and annihilation operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the number operator proves to be @xmath6 , although in the case of the free particle it is not the hamiltonian .",
    "going even further , we give a set of `` coherent '' and `` squeezed '' states which are interpreted as traveling , squeezed wave packets . this construction",
    "can easily be generalized to higher dimensions in different coordinate systems .",
    "these families of states and their construction through the qat can be of physical relevance in the description and preparation of initial states , and even time - evolution processes , in atom optics , ion traps physics and bose - einstein condensates .",
    "for instance , the process of turning off and on a harmonic potential trapping a set of atoms , as well as the production of coherent and squeezed states in this context , are easily achieved by means of the qat",
    ". it might also be useful in describing scattering processes in a discrete basis , instead of the usual approach employing plane waves .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ discretebasis-1d ] is devoted to the construction of the discrete bases of states in one dimension by means of the quantum arnold transformation , mapping the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator to the free particle hilbert space .",
    "section  [ estadoscoherentes ] deals with the construction of coherent and squeezed states and the interpretation of them as traveling , squeezed wave packets .",
    "section  [ discretebasis - higherd ] generalizes this construction to 2 and 3 dimensions in cartesian , polar and spherical coordinates , giving rise to hermite - gauss , laguerre - gauss and spherical - gauss wave packets , respectively .",
    "section  [ physical - applications ] presents some possible physical applications , and proposes experimental settings for producing and manipulating these states .",
    "section  [ comments ] gives some possible generalization of these constructions and outline possible lines of research .",
    "finally , an appendix collects the main formulas for the computation of coherent and squeezed states for the free particle .",
    "let @xmath7 be the hilbert space of solutions of the free particle , time - dependent schrdinger equation , and @xmath8 the one corresponding to the harmonic oscillator of a given frequency @xmath9 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath10 the free particle solutions and by @xmath11 the harmonic oscillator ones .",
    "then , the qat @xcite , relating solutions of time - dependent schrdinger equations for the free particle and the harmonic oscillator , or rather , its inverse , is given by : @xmath12 where the classical arnold transformation @xcite is explicitly @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 are open intervals of the real line containing @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two independent solutions of the lsode ( here dots mean derivation with respect to @xmath20 ) : @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the wronskian @xmath23 of the two solutions . for the case of the harmonic oscillator @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the two independent solutions can be chosen ( see @xcite for details ) as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "it can be checked that the change of variables results in : @xmath29    diagrammatically , the qat can be represented as :    ( 0,-1.8492187)(7.4490623,1.8492187 ) ( 1.77,1.1157813)(4.37,1.1157813 ) ( 0.9245312,1.1057812)@xmath30 ( 5.5045314,1.0857812)@xmath8 ( 1.11,0.55578125)(2.59,-1.2842188 ) ( 4.93,0.55578125)(3.33,-1.2842188 ) ( 3.0745313,-1.6142187)@xmath31 ( 0.8645313,-0.37421876)@xmath32 ( 5.204531,-0.35421875)@xmath33 ( 3.2445312,1.6457813)@xmath34    where @xmath32 and @xmath35 stand for the evolution operators of the free particle and the harmonic oscillator , respectively , while @xmath36 is the hilbert space , either for the free particle or the harmonic oscillator , of solutions of their respective schrdinger equations at @xmath16 ( see @xcite for the conditions under which @xmath36 is common to both systems ) .    thanks to the commutativity of this diagram , and the unitarity of the operators appearing in it , we can map objects ( wave functions , operators , expectation values , uncertainties ) from one system to the other . in @xcite",
    "we benefited from this fact for transporting the simplicity of the free particle to more involved systems , finding , for instance , an analytic expression for the evolution operator of the complicated systems ( even with time - dependent hamiltonians ) in terms of the free particle evolution operator . in this paper",
    "we shall proceed the other way round , transporting objects and properties from the harmonic oscillator to the free particle .",
    "applying now the qat to the time - dependent eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath37 , with energy @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 , we obtain the following set of states , solutions of the schrdinger equation for the free particle : @xmath41 where , in order to obtain a more compact notation , we have introduced the quantities @xmath42 , with dimensions of length , and @xmath43 , with dimensions of time .",
    "we also denote by @xmath44 the complex , time dependent , dimensionless expression @xmath45 .",
    "we have also used the fact that @xmath46 . note that with these definitions the normalization factor @xmath47 can be written as @xmath48 .",
    "this set of states constitutes a basis for the space of solutions of the free schrdinger equation , since it is mapped from a basis for the harmonic oscillator through @xmath49 , which is unitary .",
    "the family of wave functions ( [ discretebasis ] ) has been known in the literature as hermite - gauss wave packets @xcite , and they have been widely used , in their two dimensional version ( see section  [ discretebasis - higherd ] ) , in paraxial wave optics @xcite . however",
    ", this kind of states and the ones constructed in sections  [ estadoscoherentes ] and [ discretebasis - higherd ] are better understood in the framework of the qat .",
    "note that , making use of the classical solutions only , and through the qat , we have been able to import the time evolution from the stationary states of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath50 , to the non - stationary ones , @xmath51 , without solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the first state of this basis , the one mapped from the harmonic oscillator vacuum state , is given by :    @xmath52    which is nothing other than a gaussian wave packet with center at the origin and width @xmath53 .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 is the dispersion time of the gaussian wave packet ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ grafiquita ] shows some of these wave functions and how they evolve in time .",
    "we see that the number of `` parts '' , or _",
    "humps _ , of the wave functions , determined by the number of zeros , is `` quantized '' , in the sense that there is only one hump between two consecutive zeros .",
    "they are therefore multilocalized , as the probability of finding the particle is `` peaked '' in separate regions of space , with nearly zero probability of finding it in between .",
    "the qat also allows to map invariant operators from one hilbert space ( @xmath8 ) to the other ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "these invariant operators are also known as constant or integral of motion operators , in the sense that their matrix elements are constant with respect to their corresponding time evolution , and preserve their respective hilbert spaces .",
    "particularizing the general expression given in @xcite or by direct computation , the conserved position and momentum operator for the harmonic oscillator can be written : @xmath55 and therefore , the conserved creation and annihilation operators are : @xmath56 note that these are the operators acting on solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the harmonic oscillator @xmath50 as ladder operators .",
    "position and momentum operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 are mapped into operators representing conserved position and momentum operators for the free particle through the qat : @xmath59    as a consequence , ladder operators for the harmonic oscillator can be mapped into ladder operators for the free particle that act as creation and annihilation operators for the ( time - dependent ) hermite - gauss states : @xmath60 the action of @xmath5 and @xmath61 on the hermite - gauss wave functions is the usual one : @xmath62 it is possible to introduce this discrete basis without resorting to the qat in a very intuitive manner .",
    "the key point is that the operator @xmath63 annihilates the gaussian wave packet , and this fact characterizes it .",
    "the whole family of states ( [ discretebasis ] ) can be generated by acting with the adjoint operator @xmath64 of @xmath63 .",
    "the rest of the construction , i.e. uncertainties , coherent and squeezed states , etc . would proceed without the need of resorting to the qat .",
    "however , as we shall see below , the qat is very useful when performing involved computations in a very easy way .",
    "in fact , a very useful property of the qat is its unitarity , implying that it preserves scalar products and therefore expectation values .",
    "this will allow us to compute expectation values of operators in the free particle in terms of the corresponding ones in the harmonic oscillator .    denoting by @xmath65 the scalar product in the hilbert space of solutions of the free particle schrdinger equation , and by @xmath66 the corresponding one in the harmonic oscillator hilbert space , we have that : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are related to @xmath70 and @xmath71 through the qat , respectively .",
    "it is important to note @xcite that ( [ unitariedad ] ) is only valid when @xmath69 and @xmath71 are invariant operators",
    ". these operators are essentially @xmath72 and @xmath73 above , closing a heisenberg - weyl algebra ( or @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the harmonic oscillator ) , and their powers . among them ,",
    "the most important ones are the quadratic operators , which together with the heisenberg - weyl algebra expand the schrdinger algebra ( see ( [ chorri ] ) ) .",
    "for instance , we can apply this property to compute the uncertainties associated with each wave function . as a function of time , for each state @xmath51 , they read : @xmath76 to compute the uncertainties @xmath77 and @xmath78 we have used the transformation of non - conserved operators when they are written in terms of conserved ones , that is : @xmath79 as well as @xmath80 where in the last equality of the equations the quantum virial theorem for the harmonic oscillator potential @xcite , which is homogeneous of degree two , has been used : @xmath81 .",
    "for @xmath82 the time evolution of the uncertainty relation ( [ uncert ] ) is the one which results from the usual gaussian wave packet @xcite , and , among all , the minimal one .",
    "the number operator associated with the creation and annihilation operators above will provide the position of the state in this grid of uncertainties",
    ". we can derive it ( or map it from the number operator for the harmonic oscillator ) in the usual way : @xmath83\\,.\\ ] ] by making use of the schrdinger equation , we can turn this operator into a first order one : @xmath84\\,,\\ ] ] the validity of which is restricted to solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the action of this operator is such that : @xmath85 thus reproducing the uncertainties ( up to a factor @xmath86 ) given in eq .",
    "( [ uncert ] ) at time @xmath16 .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that this operator belongs to the algebra of the `` maximal kinematical '' symmetry of the free particle , i.e. , the schrdinger group @xcite , built out of constants of motion operators up to quadratic order .",
    "this symmetry is the standard galilean symmetry ( with generators @xmath87 , @xmath73 , @xmath72 and the identity @xmath88 ) together with spatial dilations ( generated by @xmath89 ) and non - relativistic `` conformal '' transformations ( with generator @xmath90 ) .",
    "these generators can be written , in their first - order version , as : @xmath91 providing the non - trivial commutation relations : @xmath92 & = i \\hbar &     & \\\\    \\left [ \\hat x , \\hat p^2 \\right ] & = 2 i \\hbar \\hat p &      \\left [ \\hat x , \\hat x^2 \\right ] & = 0 &    \\left [ \\hat x , \\hat{xp } \\right ] & = i \\hbar \\hat x \\\\",

    "see @xcite for the relevance of quadratic operators like @xmath0 , but distinct from the hamiltonian , for building bases of the hilbert space ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "once we have successfully imported the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator , we can go further with this scheme and map different families of coherent states from the harmonic oscillator to the free particle ( as we shall see , they might be defined equivalently , without resorting to the qat , as eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xmath63 in the free particle ) . even more",
    ", squeezed states may be introduced in a similar fashion .",
    "these states have the property that , having minimal uncertainty relations , the uncertainty in position ( or momentum ) is squeezed , at the expense of increasing the uncertainty in momentum ( or position ) .",
    "these states are used in every day experiment in quantum optics since they have low noise and allow to measure quantities with higher precision @xcite .",
    "the most general squeezed and displaced number states @xmath96 for the harmonic oscillator are built using the squeezing operador @xmath97 and the displacement operator @xmath98 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is , as usual , the complex number @xmath101 with @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is the squeezing parameter that will be taken real , @xmath104 , for simplicity .",

    "( [ free - theta ] ) in the appendix .",
    "now we focus ourselves on some particular cases , giving their physical interpretation in the free particle system . by putting @xmath116 in ( [ squeezedstates - freeparticle - text ] ) , we obtain coherent states for the free particle : @xmath117 which could also have been obtained as eigenstates of the annihilation operator since they verify : @xmath118    these states can also be obtained by the action of the imported displacement operator @xmath119 , which is , up to a phase , a galilean boost with parameter @xmath120 together with a translation of parameter @xmath121 on the gaussian wave packet .",

    "finally , let us discuss the simplest case of squeezed state , that with @xmath131 , @xmath82 and @xmath132 , corresponding to the squeezed vacuum in the harmonic oscillator or a `` squeezed '' gaussian wave packet in the free particle :    @xmath133    this wave function corresponds to a gaussian wave packet where the position and time variables have been rescaled , in addition to the wave function , as @xmath134    again , this can be interpreted as the action of the imported displacement operator @xmath135 which turns out to be a dilation .    comparing the expressions of ( [ paquete - gaussiano ] ) and ( [ paquete - gaussiano - squeezado ] )",
    ", we realize that ( [ paquete - gaussiano - squeezado ] ) corresponds to a gaussian wave packet with initial width @xmath136 .",
    "this can be easily understood since in the free particle there is no natural frequency , and therefore there is no natural width @xmath53 , so that squeezing can be absorbed in the width @xmath53 of the wave packet .",
    "the generalization of the previous construction to higher dimensions is immediate . in more dimensions , due to the symmetries of the harmonic oscillator , we can choose different separation of variables to solve the schrdinger equation for the harmonic oscillator , which amounts to find simultaneous eigenstates for the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian and other operators commuting with it and among themselves .",
    "for instance , separation of variables in cartessian coordinates in n - dimensions is equivalent to diagonalizing simultaneously the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , and the 1d harmonic oscillator in each coordinate .",
    "this can always be done even if the frequencies for each direction are different .",
    "the common basis of eigenstates is the product of 1d harmonic oscillator eigenstates in each variable .",
    "if we impose spherical symmetry , then all frequencies must coincide and we can search for common eigenstates of the hamiltonian and the angular momentum operators commuting with it and among themselves ( for instance , in three dimensions they would be @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and in two dimensions it would be only @xmath139 ) .    for the case of cartesian coordinates ,",
    "the generalization of the previous sections is immediate by a direct generalization of the qat to higher dimensions , the discrete basis of states for the n - dimension free particle being products of n copies of ( [ discretebasis ] ) in each of the @xmath140 variables @xmath141 .",
    "if @xmath142 represents a wave packet of the form given in ( [ discretebasis ] ) but in the variable @xmath143 and with width @xmath144 ( and with the corresponding frequency @xmath145 ) , then the @xmath140-dimensional wave packets are : @xmath146 where @xmath147 .",

    "the expressions , computed as in the one dimensional case , are : @xmath171    as in the one dimensional case , squeezed states , interpreted as rescaled wave packets , can also be introduced in higher dimensions .",
    "the theoretical relevance of these multi - localized , squeezed , traveling wave packets for the free particle , as well as their construction by means of the qat , is of no doubt . from a more practical point of view , the preparation of this kind of discretized free states might be achieved by the use of a harmonic oscillator the potential of which is switched off at a given time .",

    "these coherent states can be obtained by acting with time - dependent classical forces on the harmonic oscillator according to glauber @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , if the classical force is given by the potential @xmath175 , and the initial state is the vacuum @xmath176 , then , if the force @xmath177 has finite duration or it is fast decaying in time , after a suitable time a standard coherent state @xmath178 is obtained with @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the fourier component of @xmath177 in the frequency @xmath9 of the oscillator . for an arbitrary force @xmath177",
    "a time - dependent coherent state @xmath181 is obtained , see @xcite .",
    "it is possible to `` capture '' one of these traveling states at a later time @xmath182 switching on a harmonic oscillator potential with an appropriate frequency @xmath183 that would `` freeze '' and keep it in an coherent state ( without dispersion ) , until the potential is switched off again at a time @xmath184 and the wave packet is released , traveling again as a free wave packet that disperses in time . this way , information can be stored temporally in this `` oscillator traps '' , which can also be used to further manipulating them or even measuring the resulting state by means of adequate lasers .",
    "the frequency @xmath183 required to capture the dispersed wave packet should be fine tuned in such a way that the wave packet , at the time @xmath182 , matches an appropriate solution ( with the same @xmath2 and the same @xmath100 ) of the harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath183 . using the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath53 ( valid at @xmath16 ) , @xmath185 , and the fact that the width of the wave packet scales as @xmath186 ,",

    "then the state after the process described above is ( only the time dependence is explicit ) : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the starting harmonic oscillator state . this way , in the last expression only evolution operators for harmonic oscillators appear .",
    "note that if the frequency of the harmonic oscillator is not modified , and the same frequency @xmath9 is used to capture the state in the harmonic oscillator trap , the resulting state will be a squeezed state with squeezing parameter @xmath197 given by @xmath198 , which is negative .",
    "this can be seen as a feasible way of producing squeezing in trapped states , simply switching off - switching on the trap for a period of time @xmath191 , resulting in a squeezing parameter @xmath199 .",
    "in fact , a similar way of producing squeezed states in bose - einstein condensates was reported in @xcite .",
    "the states here constructed are rather robust in the sense that the number of humps is conserved even in the presence of small perturbations .",
    "numerical calculations in one dimension have been performed , simulating perturbations by square potentials ( well or barriers ) , leading to the conclusion that this holds as long as the mean energy of the state is large compared with the scale of the perturbing potential and the wave packet is sharp enough in momentum space in such a way that the transmission coefficient can be considered a constant . under these circumstances",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) , the wave packet behaves as a plane wave and the effect of the barrier in the transmitted packet is an overall attenuation , preserving its shape , and a time delay which takes its maximum values for energies near the resonant ones ( and where the transmission coefficient is one ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this result is valid for any bounded potential of compact support , provided that the width of the potential is small in the sense that the time to pass through the barrier is smaller than the dispersion time of the wave packet @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the conclusions obtained with the square potential can be generalized to any finite - range bounded potential .",
    "these wave packets are also robust under the influence of time dependent , homogeneous external fields , or even linear damping . in these cases ,",
    "the centroid of the wave packets follows the classical trajectories , but their shapes are unaltered , apart from the unavoidable dispersion .",
    "for instance , for a condensate of na atoms with size @xmath200 , this time scale is @xmath201 . ]",
    "the case of linear damping is interesting due to the fact that the presence of damping prevents the dispersion of the wave packets , which asymptotically have finite width @xcite .",
    "the case of homogeneous external fields is particularly interesting , since it includes the case of free fall , which is a common experimental situation in atomic physics or bose - einstein condensates ( see for instance @xcite ) .    under the conditions commented above",
    ", these wave packets evolve without distortion even in the presence of perturbations .",
    "however , one could be interested , acting with appropriate potentials , in obtaining transitions between wave packets with different number of humps , in such a way that , for instance , a one - hump packet splits into a two - hump packet or a two - hump packet coalesces into a one - hump packet .",
    "this would open the door to performing quantum gates acting on q - bits realized with the one - hump and the two - hump states . a way of implementing this is to benefit from the fact that wave packet dynamics is similar to wave optics in the sense that an analogue to the abcd law for optics is satisfied for wave packets @xcite .",
    "even the transmutation of hermite - gauss wave packets into laguerre - gauss wave packets can be achieved using abcd matrices , implementing a mode converter @xcite .    among further theoretical applications",
    ", we could think of expanding plane waves in terms of the discrete basis @xmath202 , with fixed @xmath203 , and describing scattering process in a discrete basis , or expanding arbitrary wave packets in a continuum over - complete set @xmath204 , with fixed @xmath205 , which could be discretized in a lattice @xmath206 of points to perform numerical computations , while keeping the over - complete character .",
    "note that they are over - complete for @xmath16 if the volume of the unit cell is smaller or equal to @xmath207 , and again by the unitary time evolution they continue to be over - complete for any @xmath191 , see @xcite .",
    "similar constructions , like the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) method @xcite or the transformed harmonic oscillator ( tho ) method @xcite have been proposed , mainly in nuclear physics , to describe the bound states and the continuum spectrum in a discrete basis .",
    "but there the construction just appears as a mathematical tool for approximating the solutions , with no physical meaning .",
    "our states , however , are physically meaningful ( as traveling wave packets ) and experimentally feasible .",
    "in this paper we have constructed different families of free particle states mapping harmonic oscillators states through the qat .",
    "it would also be possible to generalize the construction to other important families of harmonic oscillator states , _ gaussian states _",
    ", which are mixed states with the property that their wigner distribution functions are gaussian ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "they include coherent states , squeezed states and thermal equilibrium states .",
    "their main property is that gaussian states keep this property under evolution even in the presence of dissipation and decoherence .",
    "that is the reason why they have been profusely used in quantum optics and quantum information in the continuous variables formalism @xcite .",
    "we should stress that , by using the qat , the density matrix @xmath208 of a mixed harmonic oscillator state can be mapped into the density matrix @xmath209 of a mixed free particle state : @xmath210    the unitarity of @xmath34 guaranties that @xmath209 is a proper density matrix , provided that @xmath211 is .",
    "even more , it is easily checked using the evolution operator constructed in @xcite that : @xmath212",
    "\\quad   \\rightarrow \\quad { \\frac{\\partial \\hat{\\rho}}{\\partial t } } = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar } [ \\hat{h } , \\hat{\\rho}]\\ ] ] i.e. , if @xmath208 satisfies the quantum liouville equation for the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , then @xmath209 satisfies the free particle counterpart .",
    "all the properties of the density matrix @xmath208 are transferred to @xmath209 , such as characteristic functions , quasi probability distributions , etc . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath208 describes a gaussian state , also @xmath209 corresponds to a gaussian state .",
    "a deeper study of the qat applied to mixed states and how it can be used to describe dissipation and decoherence analyzing the transformation properties of master equations like the lindblad one under the qat is the object of work under progress and will be presented elsewhere .    another interesting point to study",
    "is whether the free particle states with many humps are physically observable and measurable , since their harmonic oscillator counterpart , the hermite - gauss and laguerre - gauss states are `` visible '' in quantum optics using lasers @xcite .",
    "let us consider , for instance , a two - hump wave packet @xmath213 in two or three dimensions with the humps in the transversal direction to that of the mean velocity @xmath214 .",
    "the separation of the two maxima of @xmath215 ( see fig . [ grafiquita ] ) is greater , in a factor 1.6 , than the uncertainty in position @xmath216 .",
    "therefore the two humps should be measurable , and in fact , if this wave packet propagates in a bubble or wire chamber , two parallel , divergent tracks would be observed ( if times @xmath217 are considered ) . for a three - hump wave packet ,",
    "the separation among consecutive maxima ( see fig . [ grafiquita ] ) is smaller than the uncertainty in position , although the distance between the more separated maxima is greater than the uncertainty in position .",
    "this , together with the fact that the central maximum is smaller than the external ones , suggests that only two , overlapping thick tracks would be observed in a bubble or wire chamber .",
    "a similar behavior for a larger number of humps is expected .",
    "we think that these points deserve further study and clarification .",
    "the ideas developed here could also be applied to relativistic systems , particularly to the free particle in de - sitter space - time , where the ordinary formulation of quantum theory does not find a natural physical vacuum @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the generalization of our approach to the relativistic case would provide a hierarchy of states where the first state , the relativistic counterpart of the gaussian wave packet @xcite , plays the role of a vacuum @xcite .",

    "in this appendix we write down the configuration space wave functions for coherent , squeezed , number states for the harmonic oscillator , and derive the corresponding wave functions for the free particle using the qat .",
    "let us first introduce some notation in order to simplify the expressions .",
