    "we present a comprehensive description of a two - arm tracking system consisting of eight planar drift chambers based on 5@xmath0diameter straws designed , constructed , and operated in alternating gradient synchrotron experiment 871 at brookhaven national laboratory . following a brief motivation for the experiment",
    ", we describe mechanical and electronics design considerations , important construction details , and three years experience in operating the system .      despite abundant experimental confirmations of the standard model of elementary particles and interactions ,",
    "the theory is generally perceived as incomplete , or a low energy realization of a more general theory with a full symmetry at higher energy .",
    "there are indeed many basic questions to which answers will have to come from outside the current model .",
    "this is the main motivation for theoretical and experimental explorations beyond the standard model . in particular ,",
    "lepton flavor violation occurs naturally in many extensions of the standard model ; the process is a sensitive probe of such violation . in general , rare kaon decay experiments provided a promising avenue for discovering phenomena outside the standard model .",
    "the primary goal of experiment e871 was to search for separate lepton number violation in the decay .",
    "the experiment achieved a 90% c.l .",
    "limit of @xmath1  @xcite , thus probing new interactions in nature in the 200-tev mass scale . to achieve this sensitivity ,",
    "the experiment ran with the very high beam intensities made possible by the booster at the ags .",
    "the experiment also made the first observation of the decay , measuring a branching fraction of @xmath2 based on four observed events  @xcite .",
    "over 6,000 thousand events were also observed , for a branching fraction of @xmath3 , reducing the uncertainty for this decay mode by a factor of three compared to previous attempts  @xcite .",
    "two important experimental elements relevant to this work were the ags high - intensity neutral beam and the e871 two - arm spectrometer .",
    "a novel beam stop  @xcite was located in the upstream spectrometer magnet to improve downstream acceptance , tracking , and particle identification .    ]",
    "the essential requirements on the spectrometer were good kinematic reconstruction and reliable , redundant particle identification , both to be accomplished in a high rate environment .",
    "the spectrometer , shown in figure  [ e871_acad ] , was built in the b5 beam line of the ags .",
    "the neutral beam was produced by an intense primary 24.1gev / c beam of up to 1.7@xmath410@xmath5 protons delivered in a 1.6s spill onto a 1.5-interaction - length platinum target .",
    "a system of sweeping magnets and collimators angled at 3.75@xmath6 with respect to the proton beam direction formed a neutral beam with mostly neutrons and kaons at an approximate solid angle of @xmath7 .",
    "particles emerging from the 11 m long evacuated decay volume were tracked and identified in the e871 spectrometer .",
    "the main features of the apparatus were :    * two magnets for redundant momentum measurement , tuned to form a `` parallel trigger '' for two - body decays ( i.e. , charged particles traveling downstream of the second analyzing magnets triggered the apparatus only if they traveled nearly parallel to the neutral beam direction ) ; * a beam - stop placed in the first magnet to absorb the neutral beam * redundant finely - segmented fast straw drift chambers , followed by conventional drift chambers in regions of lower rate * redundant particle identification of muons and electrons * multi - level trigger with fast on - line reconstruction * fast custom - designed massively - parallel data acquisition system .",
    "the neutral beam was absorbed in a beam stop specially designed and tested for this configuration .",
    "the effective strengths of the magnetic fields ( @xmath8 and @xmath9mev / c ) were set such that trajectories of two - body kaon decays emerged nearly parallel to the neutral beam direction downstream of the second magnet  @xcite . such an arrangement simplified triggering and provided the first level rejection of the three - body decays .",
    "the intense primary proton beam produced roughly @xmath10 @xmath11 decays per ags spill , resulting in high hit rates in the upstream straw drift chambers .",
    "additional rates in chambers resulted from leakage of low energy particles ( mainly charged , but also neutrons and photons ) from the beam - stop .",
    "the beam stop shielded the downstream part of the spectrometer , where rates were substantially reduced , thus minimizing the probability of pattern - recognition or particle - identification errors .",
    "rejection of background due to common kaon decays depended crucially on precise , redundant and low - occupancy tracking .      since tracking resolution at low momentum",
    "is dominated by multiple coulomb scattering , maximal background suppression required that the tracking system be low mass , efficient , redundant , fast ( i.e. , possess low occupancy ) , and provide good position measurement .",
    "when designing experiment 871 the following requirements for the tracking were thus imposed :    1 .   minimize multiple coulomb scattering by limiting the amount of material ; 2 .",
    "provide tracking redundancy with low rate of wire failures and low cell occupancy ; 3 .",
    "provide high hit efficiency for minimum ionizing particles ; 4 .",
    "sustain good position resolution in high rate environment ; 5 .",
    "assure good vertex reconstruction of two - body decays .",
    "the corollary from the above list are general hardware features desired of the system :    * high segmentation ( i.e. , small cell size ) * fast drift velocity gas * fast - timing electronics with short pulse tails * minimal cross - talk * mechanical robustness .",
    "we discuss the design and material choices made to accomplish the above requirements in the following sections .",
    "as figure  [ e871_acad ] illustrates , there were two straw stations between the decay tank and first spectrometer magnet , and two more between the magnets , followed by two conventional drift chamber stations downstream of the second magnet .",
    "an assembly drawing of a complete chamber module with @xmath12 and @xmath13 views is shown in figure  [ f : sdc - assy ] .",
    "the technical possibility of making thin - wall tubes suggested the replacement of traditional drift chambers  with the electric field shaped by wires  by chambers based on a continuous cylindrical cathode surface , or `` straw '' .",
    "the name derives from the manufacturing process , which is similar to that of paper drinking straws .",
    "thin , small straws with wall thicknesses of approximately 30@xmath14 and @xmath15-mm diameter , were originally used in the vertex detectors of several high energy physics experiments at e@xmath16e@xmath17 colliders  @xcite , as well as in balloon flight experiments  @xcite .",
    "they will be part of the atlas detector at the cern large hadron collider  @xcite .",
    "table  [ t : sdc - rad ] summarizes the amounts of material in an individual tracking chamber , expressed in units of radiation length .",
    "the traditional 20@xmath18gold - plated tungsten wire was used for the anode . as shown in the table ,",
    "the total radiation thickness of a typical e871 straw chamber was @xmath19 of radiation length .",
    "the thickness of conventional drift chambers was very similar .    [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     keeping down the cost of our @xmath20supply meant restricting the flow of our gas mixture to the lowest safe value .",
    "due to its small molecular size , helium could invade the straw volume through the straw walls , affecting mixture purity .",
    "in addition , electron impact dissociation in the gas produces f@xmath17 and cf@xmath21 negative ions together with f@xmath22 , cf@xmath23 and cf@xmath24 radicals .",
    "too little flow would have allowed these radicals enough time to become involved in polymerization and further chemical reactions , including etching .",
    "the copper layer is extremely volatile to fluorine or hydrogen fluoride ( hf ) under the proper conditions as a non - dry environment .    during the first running period of the experiment ,",
    "the flow was set to 3 - 5 volume exchanges per day .",
    "lab tests had shown no problems with this flow rate .",
    "however , these had been performed outside of the intense radiation environment of the e871 spectrometer , and not for such long periods . as has been discussed , we eventually discovered signs of etching in the most heavily radiated straws .",
    "for the 1995 run period the flow was increased to 8 - 10 volume exchanges per day , freezing visible etching effects . in the new set of chamber modules used in the 5-month 1996 run period , we observed no etching effects with this higher flow rate .",
    "gas volumes and flow exchanges are listed in tables  [ he_flow ] and  [ gasvol_flow ] .",
    "the gas system operated successfully , providing the necessary purity of gases while maintaining a constant flow and mixture ratio .",
    "no sulfur contamination was detected and no aging effects were observed in the performance of the detector .",
    "no further evidence of aging was observed after the flow rate increase and installation of the scrubbing systems .    during the 12 months of operation",
    "the puraspec 4037 material had slightly changed color , indicative of sulfur trapping , while the silica gel was twice overloaded with water .",
    "the nanochem oxygen cartridge was very sensitive , easily overloaded with oxygen in open air contact , and without self - indication .",
    "we replaced it on a regular schedule ( after every second cylinder of @xmath20used ) , but the system was always vulnerable to contamination from insufficient purging upstream or from any leakage downstream .",
    "the differential pressure sensors proved to be extremely useful . with gas lines of tens of meters lengths and numerous connections , valves and distribution manifolds , it was easy to limit by accident either the input or the output flow of the gas mixture .",
    "at least twice they provided critical alarms of higher pressure on the outside helium volume .",
    "the pressure was sensed through long lines since the actual sensors were located far away from the detectors ( outside the high radiation area ) .",
    "this caused a delay in measuring the actual pressure gradient .",
    "the use of manifolds with multiple stations , double filtering systems and purging capabilities , allowed the continuous and uninterrupted flow of gas for long periods ( 6 months ) .",
    "the pressure and flow sensors provided warnings for each irregularity in the normal operation and reminders for the necessary maintenance of the system .",
    "the precision of each gas component flow was @xmath2510ccm , resulting in a 5% uncertainty in the mixture ratio at the operational flow .",
    "the distribution of flow to individual modules was done with flowmeters with flow adjusting valves .",
    "these provided only a rough measurement of the portion of the total flow directed to each module .",
    "they were unreliable and two of them had to be replaced because of malfunction .",
    "also , the matheson high pressure sensors had a high rate of failure ; two stopped working after months of normal operation .",
    "the straw chambers were installed in the e871 spectrometer on tables of aluminum jig plate , which had been surveyed relative to the beam axis and target . the chambers were pinned and bolted to the tables before they themselves were surveyed .",
    "much more accurate relative positions information could be obtained using track data recorded with the spectrometer magnets off .",
    "corrections to the optical survey results were derived from this straight - through data .",
    "relative transverse corrections to chamber positions within a view ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 , left or right ) can be readily extracted from straight - through tracks , but longitudinal ( beam parallel ) and global corrections require more work .",
    "the relative positions of the left and right arms of the spectrometer were extracted from reconstructed vertex distributions , while longitudinal corrections within spectrometer arms were derived from magnet - on data , where allowances for multiple scattering in the track fitting algorithm had been disabled in software .",
    "alignment was performed iteratively .",
    "the tracking @xmath26 , measured with an independent fitting algorithm , reduced systematic errors from the combined effect of the magnetic field map and the spectrometer survey to below 1% .",
    "for every change in straw and drift chamber operating conditions , we generated new calibrations for tdc time offsets , single - wire efficiencies , and effective time - to - distance relations .",
    "more than sixty calibration updates were needed for the two years run periods .",
    "normal minimum - bias data and random - trigger data were used to perform the calibrations , which were done in an iterative fashion .",
    "noise rates determined hot or dead wires , while time sum residuals between neighboring wire pairs were minimized to determine the tdc time offsets .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f : dc - rates ] , noise rates for individual wires in the straw chambers approached 750khz at 15@xmath27 protons ( tp ) on target for wires near the beam and in front of the beam stop .",
    "the continuous cathodes and stability of the straws allowed smaller cell size for decreased occupancy , while minimizing crosstalk .",
    "a typical residual distribution is shown in figure  [ f : sdc - res ] .",
    "the mass resolution of the spectrometer as a whole is shown in figure  [ f : pipi - mass ] , which shows a mass peak with a @xmath28 mass resolution of 1.11@xmath29 .",
    "straw efficiency was flat across most of the cell area , dropping off near the straw wall , where particles traversed increasingly smaller gas path lengths .",
    "the flatness of the efficiency as a function of wire number ( and thus position ) for the most upstream chamber ( for example ) , shown in figure  [ f : eff - array ] , clearly displays the stability of the e871 straw chambers regardless of occupancy , since , as evident from figure  [ f : dc - rates ] , the upstream chamber intensity varies across the chamber face .",
    "figure  [ f : eff - wire ] displays the single - channel efficiencies for all straw and conventional drift chambers .",
    "the mean efficiencies for straws and drift chambers were 96% and 98% , respectively .",
    "we successfully developed , built , and operated a set of straw tracking chambers with over 6500 channels for the bnl e871 rare decay search .",
    "the system proved to be robust , with no rate - induced tripping or inefficiency at rates over 700khz .",
    "the system utilized a close - pack cell configuration of mylar or kapton 0.5-cm diameter , copper - lined straws with a 50:50 @xmath20-@xmath30drift gas at atmospheric pressure .",
    "we developed custom front - end amplifiers and electronics for the chambers , and operated them for two years running periods at brookhaven national laboratory .",
