    "the physical process known as double - diffusive convection was first described in the 1950 s by @xcite who observed the effect in an experiment . shortly afterwards",
    ", it was also found in astrophysics when the first detailed stellar models were computed and @xcite found irregularities in their calculations concerning whether or not a zone with a gradient in molecular weight was stable according to the ledoux criterion or the schwarzschild criterion . but",
    "even more than fifty years after its discovery , the field is still actively researched which is due to two reasons : on the one hand it lacked immediate practical incentives that have accelerated the development of other branches of fluid mechanics . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical simulations were not possible for a long time because of the considerable computational expenses they demand .",
    "for a summary of the historical development of the area see the paper by @xcite , for a recent physical review about semiconvection see @xcite .",
    "+ double - diffusive convection occurs in situations where the effect of a thermal gradient on stability and the effect of a molecular weight gradient on stability compete with each other : if the temperature gradient stabilises the system and the molecular weight gradient destabilises it , thermohaline convection can occur .",
    "its distinguishing property is the appearance of flow structures known as salt - fingers ( thus also the name salt - fingering convection ) . in the opposite case ( temperature gradient unstable and molecular weight gradient stable ) layering",
    "convection / semiconvection can occur .",
    "note that we used the term `` can occur '' . whether thermohaline / layering convection really does occur depends on the ratio of the molecular weight buoyancy frequency to the thermal buoyancy frequency , the so called stability ratio @xmath1 . in the incompressible case",
    "it is equivalent to the ratio of the rayleigh numbers associated with the thermal instability and the instability caused by the molecular weight . in this paper",
    ", our focus will be on layering convection .",
    "situations where this process occurs on earth include the convection in the arctic ocean where cool and fresh melt water from above leads to a destabilising negative temperature gradient and a stabilising negative molecular gradient in salt @xcite .",
    "other examples are east - african rift lakes which are heated from below by volcanic activity .",
    "this leads to a temperature gradient ( unstable ) and causes dissolved gases like methane and carbon dioxide to be introduced into the system , thus causing a stabilising molecular weight gradient @xcite .",
    "but not only systems on earth are prone to double - diffusive convection : it can also occur in astrophysical systems like in icy satellites , giant planets and massive stars .",
    "very recently , @xcite have investigated the effects of a stabilising compositional gradient and the resulting double - diffusive convection in titan .",
    "the role of semiconvection for the interior of giant planets has been discussed by @xcite and recently by @xcite who suggested that it might be responsible for the radius anomalies of some hot jupiters .",
    "this thought is further developed by @xcite ; they investigated the effect of semiconvection on the interior structure of planets and showed that it could explain the luminosity anomaly of saturn @xcite .",
    "they also point out : `` determining the solute transport properties in the regime of layered convection more precisely , however , will be central to evolutionary calculations .",
    "3d hydrodynamical simulations in a realistic parameter range are thus strongly needed . ''",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , numerical simulations of double - diffusive systems in a realistic astrophysical parameter range pose a serious challenge ( and are , in fact , still impossible in the stellar regime with today s computers ) because of the huge spread of length and time scales of which the smallest length scale  the size of the diffusive boundary layer  needs to be resolved .",
    "for example , the ratio of the diffusivities of temperature and solute ( the lewis number ) for the plasma in the interior of a semiconvective region of a star is @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this would require an impossible spatial resolution if one were to attempt a dns of such a zone ( also * ? ? ?",
    "while simulations are nowhere near the realistic parameter range for stellar astrophysical conditions yet , the parameter regime of giant planets has become feasible with today s computers since their prandtl and lewis numbers are much more moderate : the prandtl number ranges from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , the lewis number is about @xmath5 @xcite . for idealised microphysics ,",
    "there are a number of simulations in two dimensions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in three dimensions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in this parameter regime .",
    "recently , a simulation in a realistic parameter range for the atlantic ocean that correctly reproduces measurements has been conducted by @xcite .",
    "however , all of the mentioned studies have neglected the effect of rotation on the development of double - diffusive convection .",
    "while this may be justifiable in the case of thin layers as they are occuring in the arctic ocean ( layer thickness 1 to 5 m , see @xcite ) or in lake kivu ( average thickness of the mixed layers 0.48 m , see @xcite ) , it might not be negligible for large layers that could be forming in global convection zones on rapidly rotating giant planets and stars .",
    "it might even prove to be essential if trying to determine if layered convection is indeed occurring in giant planets and stars and what its precise influences on the transport properties are .",
    "our work is a first step in the direction of investigating the effects of rotation on semiconvective layers .",
    "we note that while @xcite did study thermosolutial convection in rotating spherical shells , they investigated a different parameter regime than the one where layers are expected to form so their work gives us no lead as to how semiconvective _ layers _ are influenced by rotation .",
    "we want to give a remark on nomenclature here : in oceans the molecular weight gradient is caused by dissolved salt .",
    "that is why salinity gradient is another common term for the molecular weight gradient , particularly in oceanography .",
    "we will use the term salinity in this papers as well because it is handier than molecular weight of second species .",
    "we assume salinity to be the concentration of the solute , no matter what exactly the solute is .",
    "the publication is structured as follows : in chapter [ sec : model_description ] we present the physical model and the underlying equations .",
    "we introduce the governing dimensionless numbers and the boundary conditions . in chapter [",
    "sec : numerical_implementation ] we discuss the numerical setup . in chapter",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results of our simulations .",
    "first , we show the results for a run with one set of parameters without rotation to have a reference framework to which we can compare the following runs ( chapter [ sec : nonrotating ] ) .",
    "next , we present the results of the simulations with rotation ( chapter [ sec : rotation ] ) and highlight some differences before investigating the influence of a change of the prandtl number @xmath6 and the density ratio @xmath0 chapter [ sec : modifying_pr_and_rrho ] .",
    "this is followed by a discussion in chapter [ sec : discussion ] and conclusions in chapter [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "two concentric spherical shells are maintained at different , constant temperatures : a hot inner sphere ( radius @xmath7 , temperature @xmath8 ) and a cool outer sphere ( radius @xmath9 , temperature @xmath10 ) .",
    "the axis of rotation is taken to be the @xmath11-axis , the rate of rotation is constant and parallel to the z - direction : @xmath12 .",
    "gravity operates inwards in radial direction : @xmath13 .",
    "the main simulation was run over a simulation time of almost one full thermal diffusion time scale .",
    "we studied the effects of an increase of the rate of rotation on the temporal evolution of a double - diffusive state .    for constant viscosities and diffusivities , the navier ",
    "stokes equations in the boussinesq form including rotation and conservation of solute , read @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17    with @xmath18 $ ] .",

    "@xmath33 is the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the saline expansion coefficient @xmath36 . with a later application in astrophysics in mind",
    ", we concentrated on systems where the centrifugal force is assumed much smaller than the gravitational force .",
    "hence , the term describing centrifugal forces @xmath37 will be neglected .",
    "the equations are nondimensionalized with the scales @xmath38    @xmath39 is the difference between outer and inner radius , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the differences of temperature and salinity between outer and inner radius .",
    "the time scale used is the thermal diffusion time scale . inserting ( [ eq : nondim ] ) into ( [ eq : ns1 ] )  ( [ eq : ns4 ] ) and dropping the asterisks",
    "leads to the dimensionless form of the equations : @xmath42 @xmath43 = - { \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}p_{\\mathrm{eff } } + \\nabla^{2 } \\boldsymbol{u } +      ra_t t \\boldsymbol{e_r } - ra_s s \\boldsymbol{e_r } - \\sqrt{{\\ensuremath{ta } } } \\boldsymbol{e_z } \\times \\boldsymbol{u},\\ ] ] @xmath44 @xmath45 where we introduced the dimensionless numbers @xmath46 @xmath6 is the prandtl number , @xmath47 is the lewis number , @xmath48 are thermal and saline rayleigh numbers , respectively , and @xmath49 is the taylor number . @xmath50 and @xmath51 are related to each other by the stability parameter @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath53 now stands for the time in thermal diffusion time scales , so that @xmath54 means that one thermal diffusion time scale has passed .",
    "we also introduced the effective pressure @xmath55 which is the gradient of the scaled original pressure plus a constant term .",
    "this can be written in this form because the constant term will vanish in the course of solving the equations .",
    "the idea behind our setup is to observe a growing double - diffusive layer and to investigate how it is influenced by rotation . to achieve that , we chose the following boundary and initial conditions .",
    "we applied no - slip boundary conditions which read @xmath56 these are reasonable boundary conditions because we assume our spherical shell to be one layer of a so called double - diffusive stack .",
    "the appropriateness of these boundary conditions is explained in chapter 3.2 of @xcite .",
    "the same assumption ( taking the shell to be one layer of many ) demands a step - like initial distribution of temperature and salt .",
    "however , since the purpose of this work is to investigate the effects of rotation on a developed double - diffusive layer it was imperative for a layer to form within our simulated spherical shell .",
    "we ran some simulations with different initial conditions : step - like initial distributions of both temperature and salinity and a step - like distribution of one quantity and a linear distribution of the other one .",
    "our goal was to test the influence of these different initial conditions on the thermal nusselt number .",
    "the thermal and saline nusselt numbers are measures for the convective heat and salt flux at the boundaries of the system , respectively .",
    "for incompressible flows ( which we are looking at ) they are defined as the ratio of the total heat or salt flux and the heat or salt flux that would be transported by conduction alone : @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the total heat flux , @xmath59 the flux that would be transported if the temperature profile was linear between the bottom and the top , @xmath60 the measured saline flux and @xmath61 the saline flux that would be transported if the concentration profile was linear between the bottom and the top .    the result is shown in figure [ fig : ic_vgl ] .    ]    ]    each initial condition leads to the same asymptotic range of values for the average thermal nusselt number which means that the physical state after relaxation is the same .",
    "only the time it takes to reach this state differs . for `` t step ,",
    "s step '' , plumes immediately reached the upper boundary of the shell without any layering in between .",
    "but as we wanted to investigate the effects of rotation on layering , this initial condition was no viable option for us .    to reduce computational costs , we did not chose `` t linear , s linear '' .",
    "this left us with the initial condition of a step in the temperature field and a linear distribution of salinity which offered a good compromise between observing layering and keeping simulation time within affordable limits .",
    "we investigated three different parameter regimes .",
    "the main simulations were run with @xmath62 and @xmath63 . to be able to reach the layered convective state",
    ", @xmath0 has to be sufficiently small .",
    "there exist two upper bounds for the maximum value of @xmath0 , for which layer formation occurs . the one given by linear stability analysis is @xmath64 which gives @xmath65 in our case . for larger values , the flow would be damped by viscous friction .",
    "the other one is given by the model of @xcite ( figure 3 therein ) and is @xmath66 with our parameters and provides an upper limit for the subcritical instability that triggers layer formation .",
    "additionally , to avoid the simple case of convective mixing due to an unstable stratification in the sense of @xcite , @xmath67 should be larger than @xmath4 . in simulations without rotation an increase of @xmath0",
    "has a stabilising effect on the flow @xcite and different regimes as a function of @xmath67 are established ( figure 3 and chapter 3.2 in @xcite and the schematic illustration in figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we have investigated if the same applies when rotation is present and have chosen @xmath68 for our main simulations and @xmath69 for comparison runs .",
    "in another set of comparison runs we reduced the prandtl number to @xmath70 to get a hint of the effects of viscosity on the rotational constraints . + a commonly used dimensionless number used to measure the respective importance of buoyancy and rotation on a system is the rossby number @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the characteristic flow speed and @xmath73 is the colatitude .",
    "this can be written as @xmath74    in order for a motion to be significantly influenced by rotation the rossby number must be of order one or less .",
    "we have chosen a range of rossby numbers near unity : @xmath75 and the case without rotation . since the used code uses the taylor number as an input parameter , we rewrite ( [ eq : ro_taylor ] ) as @xmath76",
    "a point to note is that for the same rossby number , we have different taylor numbers when the prandtl number varies .",
    "this is important because we ran simulations with prandtl numbers @xmath4 and @xmath70 .",
    "accordingly , the taylor numbers of the simulations with @xmath77 had to be doubled so that the rossby number was the same .",
    "the corresponding taylor numbers for prandtl numbers 0.5 and 1 at different colatitudes are shown in table [ tab : taylor_rossby ] .",
    ".rossby numbers and corresponding taylor numbers for prandtl numbers @xmath4 and @xmath70 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     obviously , increasing @xmath67 delays the time development of @xmath78 while lowering @xmath6 accelerates it .",
    "but since these are far too few data points to make a sound assumption about an underlying law we restrict ourselves to just listing them .",
    "we have studied the influence of rotation on semiconvection in a three dimensional spherical shell .",
    "first , we have run simulations without rotation with @xmath79 and a stability ratio @xmath68 to set up a reference calculation .",
    "then , we compared simulations with different rates of rotation to the non - rotating case and compared the values for thermal and saline nusselt numbers and kinetic energies .",
    "we concluded that slow rotation has hardly any influence on layer formation while fast rotation suppresses convective transport completely . at intermediate rotation rates",
    "the temporal development of layers may take an entire thermal diffusion time scale at some critical @xmath80 .",
    "this is why short simulation times can be highly misleading as there may be a long relaxation phase . at low rotation rates the relaxation of @xmath78 to its quasi - equilibrium value",
    "occurs on a much smaller timescale that for @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , for higher @xmath49 the equilibrium state is no longer quasi - adiabatic but becomes increasingly more superadiabatic with ever more extended , diffusive transition regions at the layer boundaries .",
    "we have also compared results from simulations with a modified prandtl number or a modified stability ratio @xmath0 and conclude that the critical value of the taylor number @xmath82 at which convection is suppressed depends weakly on @xmath6 and strongly on @xmath67 . for lower @xmath6",
    "the equilibrium state requires less ( turbulent ) kinetic energy , since less viscous friction occurs which converts kinetic energy into heat . for higher @xmath67 the maximum @xmath49",
    "for which convection develops , drops , so the critical @xmath67 in the sense of @xcite and @xcite should depend on @xmath49 .",
    "we have also compared our results with the three regimes of rotational constraints that @xcite suggested and conclude that they are a valid means of classifying the effect of rotation on semiconvection but have to be extended by a dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , if using the rossby number as a means for the influence of rotation it has to be extended by a dependence on @xmath0 as well .    we have studied the relationship of @xmath78 and @xmath81 which seems to be a good indication for the state of the flow in terms of layered convection , boundary layer creation , relaxation to thoroughly mixed convection and the final state of overturning convection . for the case without rotation , we compared our data with model predictions by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for the equilibrium state of the system , spruit s model fits our data perfectly , while wood et al.s model does so only after readjusting their fitting parameters .",
    "rosenblum et al.s model does not deliver a satisfactory fit to our data . for the rotating case ,",
    "the models have to be readjusted , however , since fast rotation is found to significantly affect the ratio of nusselt numbers .",
    "our work is a step on the ladder of correctly understanding the influence of double - diffusive convection on the heat and solute transport in rapidly rotating systems like some stars and planets .",
    "we already know that semiconvection significantly constrains heat transport .",
    "if we now respect that high rates of rotation can further decrease the effective heat and solute fluxes , the assumed overall heat flux in a rapidly rotating system undergoing double - diffusive convection has to be lowered even further when modeling planets or stars .",
    "future works can include a more precise study of the influence of rotation on the lifetime of a layer and an investigation of the opposite regime of double - diffusive convection : that of salt - fingering .",
