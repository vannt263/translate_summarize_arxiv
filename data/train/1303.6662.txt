    "we intend to map the spin problem ( [ hams ] ) to a dilute gas of interacting magnons , for values of the field @xmath12 slightly lower than the saturation field @xmath2 . for that purpose , it is convenient to use the dyson - maleev representation for the spin operators in ( [ hams ] ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are bosonic operators acting at site @xmath26 of the lattice , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the rung and leg numbers , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] . to enforce the constraint @xmath29",

    "this term should be taken into account only for @xmath20 .",
    "assuming periodic boundary conditions , we pass to the momentum representation for bosonic operators , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , with @xmath34 taking only values @xmath35 or @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the total number of rungs",
    ". then one can cast the hamiltonian ( [ hams ] ) in the following form : @xmath38 here the magnon dispersion @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where we use the shorthand notation @xmath41 in the case of the strong frustration @xmath18 , which is of main interest for us , there are two inequivalent degenerate minima of @xmath39 that are reached at wave vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 for positive and negative @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the wave vector @xmath44 is incommensurate and is given by @xmath45 the saturation field @xmath2 can be found @xcite from the condition @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the heaviside function .",
    "the external field may be viewed as playing the role of the chemical potential @xmath49 for magnons . in what follows",

    "we denote the operators describing even and odd magnons by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively : @xmath61 in this notation , the hamiltonian takes the form    @xmath62    the magnon energies and interaction amplitudes above can be read off eqs .",

    "when the magnetic field is decreased below @xmath2 , the ground state of the system can be viewed as a dilute gas of @xmath8-magnons for @xmath65 or of @xmath64-magnons for @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the last term in ( [ hamb - ac ] ) , describing the scattering of a @xmath64-magnon on an @xmath8-magnon , does not influence the structure of the ground state _ in the immediate vicinity of the saturation field _ : under the condition @xmath67 ( see fig .  [ fig : ac - magnons ] ) there is simply no regime when densities of both sorts of magnons ( @xmath8 and @xmath64 ) are _ simultaneously _ nonzero . in what follows , we assume that the condition ( [ vicinity ] ) is always satisfied , so we can safely ignore the presence of the last term in ( [ hamb - ac ] ) .",
    "however , the other amplitudes in ( [ hamb - ac ] ) , e.g. , describing conversion of a pair of @xmath8-magnons to a pair of @xmath64-magnons , have to be kept , because they contribute to intermediate virtual states in multiple scattering processes .    the other two - body interaction amplitudes for @xmath4 are @xmath68 and for @xmath20 they have to be modified as @xmath69    we have thus mapped the initial spin problem onto a 1d lattice gas of particles with a nontrivial double - minima dispersion .",
    "the renormalized two - body interaction in such a gas can be easily found in the dilute limit , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "since the self - energy vanishes at @xmath70 , the full propagator coincides with the bare one @xcite , and thus the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation for the renormalized two - body interaction vertex @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 is the total energy of the incoming particles ) takes the following form:@xcite @xmath73 where labels @xmath74 , @xmath22 , @xmath75 denote the magnon branch and can take the values `` @xmath8 '' and `` @xmath64 '' .",

    "contains an equal density of the two particle species , and for @xmath87 just one of the two species is present in the ground state . in the spin problem",
    "the total number of each bosonic species is not separately fixed , in contrast to a typical setup for atomic mixtures . in a setup with fixed particle numbers ,",
    "the ground state at @xmath86 is in the mixed phase , and @xmath87 corresponds to phase separation . in the spin language , the separated phase maps to the vector chiral ( vc ) phase @xcite , while the mixed phase corresponds to the two - component tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll2 ) @xcite .     the ladder approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation for the renormalized two - body interaction vertex @xmath88 .",

    "the resulting expressions are viewed as functions of the running cutoff @xmath80 in the spirit of the renormalization group ( rg ) approach , and the rg flow @xmath97 is then interrupted at a certain scale @xmath98 that depends on the chemical potential ( or , in other words , on the magnon density ) .",
    "the above approach is well known for one - component bose gas @xcite and has been successfully applied to the multicomponent case recently @xcite .",
    "there is an alternative approach @xcite , which , instead of the infrared cutoff in the momentum space , introduces an `` off - shell '' regularization : the two - body scattering amplitudes in the presence of a finite particle density are obtained by taking the `` bare '' expressions @xmath99 at a finite _ negative _ energy @xmath100 : @xmath101\\right|_{\\lambda=0},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 takes the same value as in eq .",

    "one can show @xcite that the off - shell regularization yields the results that are equivalent to the cutoff regularization scheme .",
    "in this work , we have used the off - shell regularization because it is more convenient technically .",
    "our model contains only short - range interactions , so the solution of ( [ bs - gen ] ) can be expressed in terms of a finite number of fourier modes in the transferred momentum @xcite . in our case , from the structure of @xmath102",
    "it is easy to see that each component of @xmath99 can contain only five fourier harmonics proportional to @xmath23 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "the system of integral equations is thus reduced to a system of linear equations that can be solved analytically for any value of the spin @xmath3 .    for the purpose of finding only the gross - pitaevsky effective couplings @xmath89 , @xmath90",
    ", the problem can be simplified even further .",
    "first of all , the system ( [ bs - gen ] ) describes four equations for the vertices , which split into two decoupled pairs : a pair of coupled equations for @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and another pair of coupled equations for @xmath109 and @xmath110 . for @xmath65 , the lowest energy excitations are @xmath8-magnons , and thus , in order to find the effective couplings @xmath89 , @xmath90 , we only need to solve the first pair of the bs equations for @xmath107 , @xmath108 ; similarly , for @xmath66 we are interested only in the equations for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",

    "for that reason , one can rewrite the integral equations ( [ bs - gen ] ) for the above two even functions , keeping only even fourier harmonics @xcite .",
    "this reduces the number of resulting linear equations to six and makes the problem amenable to analytical treatment .",
    "we refer the reader to the appendix for further details .    solving the bethe - salpeter equation",
