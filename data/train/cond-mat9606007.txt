    "the conformal dimensions @xmath45 appearing in ( [ ope : t - phi ] ) , the scaling dimension is @xmath46 and the planar spin is @xmath47 .",

    "the level-2 wzw model is equivalent to three ising models.@xcite we thus have three different ways of describing the system ( [ hamil1 ] ) in the continuum limit :    [ 3ways ] @xmath53    the representation ( [ 3ways]b ) may be useful from the point of view of symmetry since the interacting terms break down the @xmath54 symmetry to @xmath29 . however ,",
    "the representation ( [ 3ways]c ) is more practical for calculations since it is made entirely of free fields and its off - critical ( @xmath55 ) behavior may be characterized by ordinary fermion mass terms .",
    "all is not trivial , however , since the ising model contains order and disorder fields in addition to a real fermion field , and these three fields can not be expressed locally in terms of each other .",
    "nevertheless , their correlation functions are known .",
    "an additional difficulty comes from the breaking of lorentz invariance by the perturbation ( [ inter1 ] ) .",
    "we identify operators in two different languages of ( [ 3ways ] ) by requiring their operator product expansions ( ope ) to be compatible .",
    "the ope for the wzw models and the ising model are given in appendices a and b. the correspondence of operators belonging to the pictures ( [ 3ways]a ) and ( [ 3ways]c ) is the object of the next subsection .",
    "the wzw@xmath56 model can not be simply represented in terms of two majorana fermions , even if the central charge is the same in both cases ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the reason is the nonexistence of a real , spin-@xmath4 representation of @xmath29 .",
    "however , two copies of wzw@xmath56 is equivalent to an @xmath58 wzw model , and the latter group admits a representation in terms of four real fermions . a representation of the wzw currents @xmath59 and @xmath60 in terms of four majorana fermions @xmath61 follows immediately and its structure bears a strong resemblance with the chiral generators of the lorentz group :    [ j:4fer ] @xmath62    ( the corresponding expressions for @xmath39 are obtained by reversing the sign of @xmath63 ) . using the ope s ( [ ope : fermion ] ) and wick s theorem , it is a simple task to check that the ope s ( [ ope : jj ] ) are satisfied .    a representation of the matrix fields @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( the staggered magnetizations of the two chains ) in terms of ising fields is also needed in order to calculate correlation functions , and may be found in the following fashion .",
    "first , since @xmath64 and @xmath65 have conformal dimensions @xmath66 , they must be products of four order and disorder fields , such as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and so on ( there are @xmath69 such products ) .",
    "second , the action of each of the currents @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 may be calculated on these 16 products , using the ope s ( [ ope : ising]e - h ) .",

    ", the field @xmath70 is an eigenvector of @xmath71 with eigenvalue @xmath72 .",
    "once such an eigenvector is found , one may apply on it the other components of the currents @xmath59 and @xmath73 and thus obtain the other components of @xmath64 .",
    "only one eigenvector allows a nontrivial solution ( i.e. , nonzero values of all the components of @xmath64 ) .",
    "the same procedure is used for @xmath65 , with the currents @xmath74 . at last",
    ", one finds the following representation ( we used the decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) ) : @xmath75 note that the ope s @xmath76 and @xmath77 are satisfied , as they should : the two chains are independent at this stage .    it is also possible to calculate the ope of @xmath64 with itself , with the help of eqs  ( [ ope : ising]a - d )",
    "this is a bit tricky , since one must remember to anticommute the different disorder fields .",
    "with the normalization chosen above and omitting terms that do not diverge as @xmath78 , the end result coincides with eq .",
    "( [ ope : gg ] ) for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , plus the ope @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the representation ( [ j:4fer],[g:4fer ] ) is a complete and faithful representation of two independent copies of the wzw@xmath56 model .",
    "we are now able to write down the lagrangian associated to the continuum limit of ( [ hamil1 ] ) solely in terms of real fermions .",
    "the noninteracting part @xmath80 , equivalent to the two level-1 wzw models , is the free - fermion lagrangian : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the velocity of spin excitation in isolated chains .",

    "( [ emtensor ] ) ) where @xmath92 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "one may combine the energy - momentum tensor with the kinetic term and this amounts to the following renormalizations of the speed and fields : @xmath93 in the case at hand , the velocity @xmath94 is renormalized differently from @xmath95 : @xmath96 after the field renormalization , the interaction lagrangian takes the following form : @xmath97 the @xmath98 symmetry of the fixed - point , obvious in the lagrangian ( [ freeham ] ) , is violated by the interchain coupling @xmath99 , both in the interaction ( [ interac ] ) and by the distinct renormalization of @xmath94 .",
    "the interaction terms ( [ interac ] ) are marginal , since they have conformal dimensions @xmath100 . their behavior under renormalization - group flow is characterized by their @xmath101-functions . instead of calculating the latter in the usual way ( a one - loop feynman diagram ) , let us follow polyakov,@xcite who has shown that the @xmath101-functions of a critical system perturbed by marginal terms are related to the coefficients of the operator algebra .",

    "the terms in @xmath114 only contribute to a shift of the vacuum energy and will be ignored . the interaction ( [ interac ] )",
    "may be expressed as a linear combination of the operators @xmath115 : @xmath116 with @xmath117 the rg equations obtained from ( [ rg1 ] ) and ( [ ope : kpm ] ) are @xmath118 if @xmath119 the starting point is @xmath120 and @xmath121 , thus @xmath122 is negative and @xmath123 positive and small . under this flow , @xmath122 renormalizes to zero ( it is marginally irrelevant , like for an isolated spin chain ) and @xmath123 is marginally relevant . by following the rg flow until @xmath124 ( the correlation length ) ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath125 : a dynamical length scale @xmath126 has set in .",
    "if we concentrate on the heisenberg model ( [ hamil1 ] ) without referring to the underlying hubbard model , the characteristic spin velocity should be @xmath127 and the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath123 should be @xmath128 .",
    "thus the dynamical length scale is @xmath129 .",
    "this conclusion was reached in ref .   in the @xmath130 representation .",
    "we shall conclude from this that the fermions have acquired a mass @xmath131 .",
    "the first three fermions ( @xmath132 ) have a common mass @xmath133 , while @xmath63 has a slightly higher mass @xmath134 ( in absolute value ) , since @xmath135 .",
    "an additional velocity renormalization will take place during the rg flow , but can not be calculated by the above method . in a diagrammatic technique , it would show up at two loops , in a self - energy correction .",
    "the overall velocity renormalization is important , since without it the long - distance theory would have an @xmath98 symmetry and all four fermions would have the same mass ( up to a sign ) .    in order to clarify the significance of these dynamically generated mass scales ,",
    "let us consider the following model : @xmath136 this model would be equivalent to the lagrangian ( [ freeham],[interac ] ) if all velocities were equal , if @xmath137 and if @xmath138 , with @xmath139 , @xmath140 ( kramers - wannier duality ) . the model ( [ o(n)model ] ) has @xmath141 symmetry and a mass gap arises non - perturbatively in the spectrum if @xmath142 . to see this in a mean - field approach , we assume that @xmath143 ( no sum over @xmath88 ) and determine @xmath144 self - consistently .",
    "let us make the substitution @xmath145 in the lagrangian , neglecting terms quartic in @xmath146 , which is equivalent to a large-@xmath147 approximation .",

    ", we conclude that @xmath166 .    a short remark about the sign of the mass : from the ising model viewpoint",
    ", this sign simply indicates on which side of the transition we stand : by convention , @xmath167 in the disordered phase ( @xmath168 ) and @xmath169 in the ordered phase ( @xmath170 ) . of course , it is the absolute value @xmath171 which occurs in the dispersion relation of the fermions .",
    "the appearance of fermion mass terms breaks the diagonal @xmath172 symmetry @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) of the full lagrangian ( [ freeham],[interac ] ) .",
    "thus , the ground state must be doubly degenerate and the condensate @xmath175 picks one of these ground states , the theory of massive fermions describing excitations above that ground state only .",
    "this is consistent with the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem , which states that a half - integer spin chain with local interactions and no explicit parity breaking has either no gap , or else has degenerate ground states .",
    "in a recent paper , rao and sen@xcite have argued that dimerized spin chains with second nearest - neighbor interactions admit possibly three different phases ( here we use the word ` phase ' to distinguish regions where the spin structure factor @xmath176 is not peaked at the same value of @xmath177 ) .",
    "they name the three phases as follows:@xcite a nel phase ( @xmath176 is peaked at @xmath178 ) , a spiral phase ( @xmath176 is peaked at an intermediate momentum between @xmath178 and @xmath179 ) and a collinear phase ( @xmath176 is peaked at @xmath179 ) . in view of the numerical results from chitra and al.@xcite ,",
    "the collinear phase should not be stable for the spin-@xmath4 chain . at first sight , there are two paths that @xmath176 may follow to go from the nel phase to the collinear phase .",
    "the first possibility is for the peak of @xmath176 to move continuously from @xmath178 to @xmath179 , thus going through a spiral phase .",
    "the second possibility is for the peak of @xmath176 at @xmath178 to progressively decrease in amplitude while a second peak at @xmath179 progressively appears ; the system might then go through a dimerized state . in view of this , the question of the existence or not of a spiral phase for the frustrated spin-@xmath4 chain arises . to answer this question",
    ", we need to known how the spin structure factor evolves as a function of the ratio @xmath128 .",
    "unfortunately , in the present continuum approach we can only calculate the spin - spin correlation function near @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath13 . as seen below",
    ", this calculation is also interesting from the point of view of symmetry and allows to relate the elementary spin excitations to the fermions @xmath180 .",
    "the main conclusion of sect .  [ naboss ] is that the system ( [ hamil1 ] ) may be described in the continuum limit by four noninteracting real fermions : three with mass @xmath167 and velocity @xmath21 , and one with mass @xmath181 and velocity @xmath182 .",

    "the @xmath183-component of the spin density has the following expression near the wavevectors accessible to the continuum limit : @xmath184    thus , the spin - spin correlation function near @xmath14 takes the form @xmath185 while near @xmath15 , it takes the following form : @xmath186 in the first case ( @xmath177 near 0 ) , the two fermions have the same mass and velocity , while in the second case ( @xmath177 near @xmath178 ) they have different masses and velocities . consider the case of two fermions with different masses ( @xmath133 and @xmath187 ) but identical velocities ( for simplicity ) . the imaginary part of the fourier transform of the spin - spin correlation function ",

    "@xmath192 this result becomes the spin structure factor near @xmath14 : @xmath193 neglecting velocity renormalization ( @xmath164 ) , the model is @xmath98 symmetric at long distances and @xmath194 .",

    "the expression of @xmath196 appropriate for the more realistic case @xmath197 can be obtained in closed form but is too cumbersome to display here .    the fact that @xmath198 reflects the conservation of the total magnetization .",
    "this is not the case for the total magnetization of each chain , since @xmath199 , unless the two chains are decoupled ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath201 .    according to eq .",
    "( [ szq ] ) , the magnetic susceptibility near @xmath13 is a product of four two - point functions of the ising model , involving order and disorder fields .",
    "for instance , near @xmath202 , @xmath203 where @xmath204 and @xmath205 are respectively the two - point functions of the order field and disorder field , as a function of the reduced distance @xmath206 .",
    "these functions are known@xcite and their leading asymptotic behavior is , in the disordered phase of the ising model , @xmath207 where @xmath208 is some constant and @xmath209 are the modified bessel functions .",
    "if the argument of @xmath210 is negative ( i.e. for a negative mass ) , we perform a kramers - wannier duality transformation and identify @xmath211 with @xmath205 .",
    "thus , the leading asymptotic behavior of the susceptibility near @xmath202 is @xmath212 notice that @xmath213 is the real - space propagator of a free boson of mass @xmath133 .",

    "thus , the single - particle magnetic excitations live around @xmath221 , whereas the excitations near @xmath222 have a two - particle behavior and those near @xmath223 have a three - particle behavior .",

    ". however , this would be unobservable in practice because of domain effects .",

    ", we expect a nonzero value of the string order parameter for two reasons .",
    "first , since the @xmath29 symmetry can not be spontaneously broken  according to the mermin - wagner theorem  the mass of the first ising model ( @xmath234 ) must be the same as that of the second ising model ( @xmath235 ) , in order to keep the symmetry under the exchange of the labels 1,2 and 3 .",
    "it naturally implies that they must have the same sign .",

    "secondly , since a gap open by the introduction of the interchain coupling , the masses @xmath234 and @xmath235 must be nonzero .",
    "we can also reveal the presence of the @xmath226 symmetry without going to the continuum limit , i.e. , directly from the hamiltonian ( [ hamil1 ] ) .",

    "an four - fold degeneracy of the ground state of @xmath255 in the thermodynamic limit does not follow from this broken symmetry since this is not a local symmetry.@xcite",
    "the crucial difference between the hamiltonian ( [ hamil1 ] ) and that of the more familiar spin ladder is the occurrence , in the latter , of an interaction term of the form @xmath256 ( @xmath257 is some constant proportional to the interchain coupling ) .",

    "if the two rungs of the zig - zag had different couplings ( @xmath0 and @xmath261 ) , an interaction like ( [ ladder1 ] ) would be generated and the gap would have a linear dependence on the interchain coupling .",
    "of course , the marginal interaction ( [ interac ] ) is always present and provides an additional renormalization of the masses . as @xmath262 ,",
    "the dependence of the gap on the interchain coupling should become more and more exponential because of this renormalization .",
    "we were concerned in this work with the regime @xmath119 and the conclusions are nominally valid only in this regime , although we expect them to be qualitatively correct even for @xmath263 .",
    "however , in the opposite regime ( @xmath264 ) the system should be treated as a single chain and we should perturb around a single wzw@xmath56 model .",

    "so far we have supposed that @xmath0 is positive , corresponding to an antiferromagnetic interchain coupling . the ferromagnetic case may be treated just as well . in that case , both interaction constants @xmath267 of eq .",

    "this is not the same as saying that the two chains _ decouple _ at long distances , since in that case the structure of excitations would be different .",
