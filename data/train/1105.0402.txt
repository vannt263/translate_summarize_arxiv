    "it has long been assumed that the solar corona is heated by dissipation of magnetic disturbances that propagate up from the sun s convection zone ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "convective flows interacting with magnetic flux elements in the photosphere can produce magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves that propagate up along the flux tubes and dissipate their energy in the corona .",
    "also , in closed magnetic structures the random motions of photospheric footpoints can lead to twisting and braiding of coronal field lines , and to the formation of thin current sheets in the corona .",
    "magnetic reconnection within such current sheets may cause impulsive heating events , called `` nanoflares '' @xcite .",
    "the observed x - ray emission from solar active regions may be due to the cumulative effects of many such coronal heating events .",
    "however , the detailed physical processes by which the corona is heated are not yet fully understood .",
    "the heating of solar active regions has in principle two contributions : ( 1 ) energy may be injected into the corona as a result of small - scale , random footpoint motions , or ( 2 ) the dissipated energy may originate from a large - scale nonpotential magnetic field such as a coronal flux rope @xcite . in the second case the magnetic free energy",
    "is already stored in the corona , and does not need to be transported into the corona from the lower atmosphere . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the first case , i.e. , we assume that the large - scale magnetic field of the active region is close to a potential field , and that most of the energy for coronal heating is provided by small - scale footpoint motions .",
    "detailed mhd models of magnetic braiding have been developed by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this modeling has generally confirmed parker s ideas concerning the development of thin current layers in magnetic fields subject to random footpoint motions . however , except for the work by @xcite , the above - mentioned models do not attempt to describe the real structure and dynamics of the photospheric magnetic field .",
    "most models use a highly simplified geometry in which the curvature of the coronal loops is neglected and the background magnetic field is assumed to be uniform , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the unit vector in a cartesian reference frame @xcite .",
    "the photosphere at the two ends of the loop is represented by two parallel plates @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the magnetic field lines are assumed to be `` line - tied '' at these boundaries .",
    "the imposed horizontal flows @xmath4 at the boundaries are usually taken to be _",
    "this is very different from the converging and diverging motions observed at the solar surface .",
    "observations show that the photospheric magnetic field outside sunspots is highly intermittent and is concentrated into small flux elements or `` flux tubes '' with kilogauss field strengths and widths of a few @xmath5 km @xcite .",
    "these flux tubes are located in intergranular lanes and are continually jostled about by convective flows below the photosphere .",
    "these features of the boundary motions are not yet accurately represented in the braiding models .",
    "another important aspect of the lower atmosphere is that it takes a significant amount of time for the effects of the footpoint motions to be transmitted into the corona .",
    "the flux tubes interact with convective flows at the base of the photosphere , and it takes 60 to 80 seconds for an alfvn wave to travel from that level to the base of the corona ( a height difference of about 2 mm ) .",
    "furthermore , alfvn waves are subject to strong wave reflection , as the alfvn speed increases from about 15 km / s in the photospheric flux tubes to more than 1000 km / s in the corona . on first impact with the chromosphere - corona transition region ( tr )",
    ", only a small fraction of the wave energy is actually transmitted into the corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it takes many bounces for the waves to be transmitted .",
    "therefore , the relationship between the photospheric footpoint motions and the horizontal motions in the low corona is very complex and is subject to significant time delays .",
    "these delays are not included in existing models of field - line braiding .",
    "in previous models of coronal magnetic braiding it was assumed that the photospheric footpoint motions relevant to braiding occur on a horizontal length scale @xmath6 comparable to that of the solar granulation or larger ( @xmath7 mm ) .",
    "granulation flow patterns evolve on a time scale of a few minutes , and the kilogauss flux elements ( located in the intergranular lanes ) are forced to move with these evolving flows .",
    "it was assumed that the main effect of the granulation is to produce random _ displacements _ of the flux elements as a whole .",
    "however , there may also exist _ transverse motions inside the flux elements _ on a scale less than the element width ( about 100 km ) .",
    "this is plausible because the flux tubes are surrounded by convective downflows that are highly turbulent @xcite . in the region just below the photosphere a flux element is subject to transverse motions that not only displace the flux element as a whole , but may also distort its shape and cause random intermixing of the field lines inside it .",
    "the process is illustrated in figure [ fig : cartoon ] , which shows a kilogauss flux tube being distorted by convective flows that push the field lines from left to right in the figure . at present ,",
    "little is known from observations about the magnitude of such transverse motions or the time scales involved . however , such small - scale transverse motions could have important effects on the upper atmosphere by producing alfvn waves that propagate upward along the field lines and dissipate their energy in the chromosphere and corona .",
    "alfvn waves have indeed been observed both in the chromosphere @xcite and in the corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the possible role of small - scale random motions inside photospheric flux elements in heating the solar atmosphere .",
    "the chromosphere is a conduit for the transport of mass and energy into the corona .",
    "actually , only a small fraction of the non - thermal energy injected into the solar atmosphere is transmitted to the corona ; most of the energy is dissipated in the lower atmosphere . therefore , to understand the heating of the sun s upper atmosphere it is important to study the structure , dynamics and heating of the chromosphere .",
    "high - resolution observations of the chromosphere have shown that it has a complex thermodynamic structure that is strongly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the chromosphere is highly dynamic , and is filled with jet - like features such as mottles and dynamic fibrils on the solar disk @xcite and spicules at the limb @xcite .",
    "realistic three - dimensional mhd models of spicule - like structures have been developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "internetwork regions on the quiet sun are affected by p - mode waves that travel upward from the photosphere and produce shocks that cause intermittent heating @xcite .",
    "these shocks produce distinct asymmetries in the profiles of the ca  ii h & k lines . however , the magnetic network and plage regions appear to be heated in a different way . first , these regions are _ continually bright _ in the cores of the ca",
    "ii h & k and ca  ii 8542  lines , and the width of the h@xmath8 line is enhanced compared to the non - magnetic surroundings @xcite , indicating that the magnetic chromosphere is heated by a sustained heating process .",
    "second , the wavelength profiles of the ca  ii h line from network / plage elements are _ symmetric _ with respect to the rest wavelength , indicating that the heating is not due to acoustic shock waves . in this paper",
    "we investigate whether the heating of the magnetized chromosphere may be due to dissipation of alfvn waves as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the observational constraints on braiding models are discussed .",
    "it is shown that , if the corona is heated by dissipation of braided fields , the braiding must occur on small transverse length scales ( less than a few arcseconds ) .",
    "this motivates us to develop a 3d mhd model for the dynamics of alfvn waves inside a magnetic flux tube extending from the photosphere through the chromosphere into the corona .",
    "the mhd model is described in section 3 , and modeling results are presented in section 4 .",
    "the results are further discussed in section 5 .",
    "active regions contain loop - like structures that are aligned with the direction of the coronal magnetic field . in this section",
    "we use data from the x - ray telescope ( xrt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on hinode @xcite to search for braided magnetic fields in the corona .",
    "figure [ fig : xrt1]a shows active region ar 11041 observed on 2010 january 25 , starting at 11:02 ut .",
    "the observation used the ti - poly filter , which is sensitive to plasma with temperatures greater than 1 mk . in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we added 12 exposures with exposure time 0.51 s , taken over a period of 50 minutes .",
    "figure [ fig : xrt1]b shows a spatially filtered image where the high spatial frequencies have been enhanced to bring out the loop structures .",
    "the structure of the emission is complex , and multiple structures are superposed along the line of sight .",
    "there are some distinct coronal loops , but there is also a more diffuse emission component .",
    "the loop widths vary from about 3 arcsec for the narrowest loops to about 20 arcsec for the widest ones .",
    "the wider loops show some variation in x - ray brightness across the loop on a scale of a few arcseconds , and these fine - scale structures appear to be aligned with the loop axis .",
    "however , our ability to observe these features is limited by the spatial resolution of xrt and ( for the outer parts of the ar ) by photon noise .",
    "the wrapping of bright loops around each other has occasionally been observed with the _ transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) _ ( see examples in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these cases are often ambiguous and most loops observed with trace do not show evidence for magnetic braiding . to search for braided fields with xrt , we looked for places in figure [ fig : xrt1 ] where two loops appear to cross each other .",
    "there are only a few such sites within the observed active region . if the magnetic field were braided on observable scales ( greater than 5 arcsec )",
    ", one would expect to find many more such loop crossings .",
    "the few examples that can be found seem to involve loops that are well separated in height , and do not appear to be due to braided structures . for the wider coronal loops , it appears that the different threads within the loop are co - aligned to within a few degrees , not @xmath9 as predicted by parker s original braiding model @xcite .",
    "we conclude there is no evidence for the existence of strongly braided magnetic fields in the corona on spatial scales of a few arcseconds or larger",
    ". if there is braiding on the sun , it must occur on small transverse scales ( less than 5 arcsec ) and involve small mis - alignment angles ( at most a few degrees ) .",
    "an important constraint on any model for coronal heating is that it must explain the average heating rate .",
    "the observed radiative and conductive losses of active regions imply a nonradiative energy flux into the corona @xmath10",
    "@xmath11 @xcite . assuming this energy enters a coronal loop at both ends and",
    "is distributed uniformly over the full length @xmath12 of the loop , the average volumetric heating rate @xmath13 . for a loop with constant cross section and length @xmath14 mm",
    "we obtain @xmath15 @xmath16 . another method for estimating the heating rate is to use the scaling laws first developed by (",
    "* hereafter rtv ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the peak temperature ( in k ) , @xmath19 is the coronal plasma pressure ( in @xmath20 ) , and @xmath12 is the loop length ( in cm or mm ) .",
    "x - ray observations indicate that the loops in the core of an active region have high temperature and pressure , @xmath21 mk and @xmath22 @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming a loop length @xmath14 mm , the required heating rate is about @xmath23 @xmath16 .",
    "can the quasi - static braiding models explain such heating rates ? in parker s original model @xcite it is assumed that there exist distinct `` flux tubes '' that can be traced from the corona into the photosphere .",
    "these flux tubes are assumed to retain their identity for about 1 day as their footpoints are moved around on the photosphere , and thin current sheets develop at the interfaces between the flux tubes @xcite .",
    "to explain the observed heating rates , large departures from the potential field must develop .",
    "specifically , the angle @xmath24 between the braided field @xmath25 and the potential field @xmath26 must be about @xmath9 @xcite , otherwise the poynting flux into the corona is insufficient to balance the observed radiative and conductive losses .",
    "these large deviations from the potential field are predicted to occur on transverse scales of a few megameters or larger , and therefore should be readily observable in the fine structures of coronal loops .",
    "as discussed in section [ sect : obs ] , there is no observational evidence for braided fields on such scales .",
    "therefore , it appears that parker s original version of the braiding model ( with relatively long - lived flux tubes braided on observable scales ) is incompatible with coronal observations .    in other braiding models",
    "the boundary flows are incompressible and vary randomly with time .",
    "this implies that any two points on the boundary tend to separate from each other ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hence there are no well - defined `` flux tubes '' that retain their identity for many hours .",
    "this type of model is consistent with the observation that photospheric flux elements frequently split up and merge @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fields produced in such models are more fragmented than those predicted by parker s original model .",
    "specifically , current sheets can develop anywhere within the volume , and the strongest currents will develop in locations where the footpoint motions have the largest cumulative shear .",
    "analytic studies predict a rapid `` cascade '' of magnetic energy to small transverse scales @xcite .",
    "in fact , the cascade proceeds so rapidly that the energy is dissipated before strong departures from the potential field can develop . as a result ,",
    "these simple cascade models have difficulty explaining the observed rate of coronal heating in active regions .",
    "the model predicts that the coronal heating rate per unit volume is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the coronal field strength , @xmath29 is the rms velocity of the footpoint motions , @xmath30 is the correlation time , and @xmath31 is the magnetic reynolds number ( see * ? ? ? * ) . for motions induced by the solar granulation ,",
    "@xmath32 minutes , which is slow compared to the coronal alfvn travel time ( @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the alfvn speed , @xmath35 @xmath36 ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field is expected to evolve through a series of nearly force - free equilibrium states .",
    "note that @xmath37 is proportional to the product @xmath38 , which is essentially the photospheric diffusion constant , @xmath39 in this model .",
    "therefore , measurements of @xmath40 can be used as a constraint on the braiding model . using @xmath41 @xmath42 @xcite",
    ", it was found that the heating rate predicted by the cascade model is a factor 10 to 40 smaller than the heating rate observed in active regions .",
    "numerical simulations of magnetic braiding driven by slow , random , incompressible footpoint motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict heating rates that are basically consistent with equation ( [ eq : q1986 ] ) . therefore",
    ", like the above cascade model , these numerical models also can not explain the observed heating rate when realistic values for the random walk diffusion constant @xmath40 are inserted into the model .",
    "we conclude that neither parker s original version of the braiding model nor its later modifications can adequately explain the structure and heating of coronal loops in active regions .",
    "this leads us to consider other types of footpoint motion , such as small - scale random motions _ inside _ the photospheric flux elements ( see figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "a model for the dynamics of plasma and magnetic field inside a coronal loop is developed .",
    "we consider only a thin tube of magnetic flux , corresponding to a single kilogauss flux tube in the photosphere .",
    "the tube extends from the photosphere at one end of the loop , through the chromosphere into the corona , and back down into the photosphere at the other end . in the photosphere and",
    "chromosphere the flux tube is assumed to be vertically oriented .",
    "we assume that a single flux tube at one end of the loop is connected to a single flux tube at the other end , i.e. , we ignore the fact that on the real sun the photospheric flux concentrations at the two ends are uncorrelated and do not perfectly match up .",
    "also , on the real sun magnetic flux elements frequently split up and merge with their neighbors .",
    "such processes may lead to magnetic reconnection and may be important for coronal heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in the present model we neglect such effects , and we assume that the flux tube retains its identity for the duration of the simulation .",
    "the tube has a length @xmath43 , and the overall curvature of the tube is neglected .",
    "we use a coordinate system @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the coordinate along the tube axis ( @xmath46 ) , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are perpendicular to the axis .",
    "note that near the `` left '' end of the flux tube ( @xmath49 ) the height in the lower atmosphere is given by @xmath45 and gravity acts in the @xmath50 direction , but near the `` right '' end ( @xmath51 ) the height is given by @xmath52 and gravity is in the @xmath53 direction . despite these differences",
    ", we will sometimes refer to @xmath45 simply as the `` height '' in the flux tube .",
    "the tube is assumed to have a circular cross - section with radius @xmath54 , which is much smaller than its length @xmath43 . to simulate the effects of solar convection interacting with the flux tube ,",
    "we impose random footpoint motions on the field lines at the base of the photosphere ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "these motions produce alfvn waves that travel along the flux tube , reflect due to gradients in alfvn speed , and generate turbulence via nonlinear wave - wave interactions .",
    "the dynamics of the waves inside the tube are described by the equation of motion , @xmath55 and the magnetic induction equation , @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the plasma density , @xmath58 is the pressure , @xmath59 is the velocity , @xmath60 is the magnetic field , @xmath61 is the acceleration of gravity , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are viscous and resistive dissipation terms .",

    "the velocity @xmath65 can be split into parallel and perpendicular components : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the unit vector along the perturbed magnetic field , and @xmath68 .",
    "taking the inner product of equation ( [ eq : dvdt ] ) with @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath70 the first term on the right hand side is the centrifugal force due to changes in the shapes of the magnetic field lines , which is an important driver of field - aligned flows .",
    "however , in the present paper we will neglect parallel flows and focus on the perpendicular motions of the plasma .",
    "note that , according to equation ( [ eq : dbdt ] ) , the parallel velocity @xmath71 has no direct effect on the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "in this paper we use the so - called reduced mhd ( rmhd ) approximation @xcite , which assumes that the magnetic fluctuations are small compared to the background field . in subsection [ sect : rmhd ] we present a derivation of the rmhd equations in the context of the present model . in the following subsections",
    "we describe the structure of the background atmosphere , the imposed footpoint motions , and the numerical techniques for solving the rmhd equations .",
    "subsection [ sect : limitations ] describes some of the limitations of the present model .      in this section",
    "we derive the rmhd equations describing the nonlinear dynamics of alfvn waves in a flux tube with non - constant cross - section and with density varying by orders of magnitude along the flux tube .",
    "the rmhd equations were first derived by @xcite and @xcite for a uniform background field ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the relationships between compressible mhd , incompressible mhd and reduced mhd were extensively discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the extension of the rmhd equations into the kinetic regime .",
    "@xcite included the effects of plasma pressure , spatial inhomogeneities and parallel flows into the formalism , and they derived a more general set of four coupled equations .",
    "however , they did not include the effects of gravity . in the absence of gravity",
    ", the magneto - static equilibrium equation implies that the gradient of the plasma pressure is perpendicular to the mean magnetic field , @xmath72 .",
    "in contrast , in the present case gravity plays an important role in the stratification of the plasma pressure @xmath73 and density @xmath74 in the photosphere and chromosphere , and at the axis of the flux tube @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the four - field equations derived by @xcite can not be directly applied to the present case .",

    "we use a relatively small number of basis functions ( @xmath276 ) ; the functions are shown in figure [ fig : func2 ] .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the footpoint motions have a pattern consisting of two counter - rotating cells .",
    "this pattern can be described as a superposition of two modes with azimuthal mode number @xmath277 . for the particular set of basis functions used in the present paper ,",
    "these driver modes have indices @xmath278 and @xmath279 ( see appendix b for details ) , and are shown in the top row of figure [ fig : func2 ] ( seventh and eighth image from the left ) .",

    "the vertical component of vorticity at @xmath2 is then given by @xmath290 the above time - dependent pattern simulates the intermixing of the plasma within the flux tube due to motions imposed by the surrounding convective flows .    the random variables @xmath291 and @xmath292 are constructed as follows .",
    "for each variable , we first create a normally distributed random sequence @xmath293 on a grid of times covering the entire length of the simulation ( @xmath294 s ) .",

    "in particular , the model does not describe field - aligned flows such as spicules .",
    "the present model for chromospheric and coronal heating has several drawbacks and limitations .",
    "the code uses an explicit numerical scheme , which makes it difficult to simulate waves in models with high coronal field strength . on the real sun",
    "the field strength in active region loops in the low corona is 100 - 500 g , but in the present paper we must limit ourselves to @xmath309 g. also , the model includes only a limited number of wave modes ( see figure [ fig : func2 ] ) , and the time step is relatively large ( @xmath310 s ) , so the turbulent spectrum is not well resolved .",
    "the model considers only a single magnetic flux tube , and does not allow for splitting and merging of magnetic flux elements at the two ends of the coronal loop .",
    "it is unclear to what extent the chromospheric and coronal heating rates and the spatial distribution of the heating are affected by this approximation . perhaps more importantly",
    ", the present rmhd model does not allow for feedback of the heating on the background atmosphere .",
    "in the present version there are no field - aligned flows , and the temperature and density are assumed to be constant in time , so we do not simulate the dynamic response of the atmosphere to heating events .",
    "this also means that we can not make predictions regarding the temporal variability of euv and x - ray emissions from the modeled coronal loops .",
    "in particular , we do not simulate spicules or similar dynamic events , even though such events may in fact be driven by nonlinear alfvn waves ( see * ? ? ? * ) . the plasma density in our model",
    "is assumed to be constant in planes perpendicular to the tube axis , so there are no variations in density on scales less than the tube radius .",
    "therefore , the present model has little to say about the multi - thermal structure of coronal loops .",
    "finally , the model does not include the effects of phase mixing @xcite or resonant absorption , which depend on the variation of alfvn speed in the plane perpendicular to the tube axis . in the present model",
    "both @xmath28 and @xmath76 are constant in the @xmath268 plane .",
    "we first construct a reference model with coronal field strength @xmath311 g , expansion factor @xmath245 , and coronal loop length of about @xmath312 mm .",
    "more precisely , the coronal loop length @xmath248 mm , the transition - region height @xmath246 mm , and the total tube length @xmath313 mm .",
    "the footpoint motions have a correlation time @xmath297 s , each of the driver modes has a vorticity @xmath314 @xmath302 , and the rms velocity is @xmath315 @xmath36 .",
    "the latter is reasonable compared to the convective velocities of several km / s expected to exist in the downflow lanes below the photosphere .",
    "the tr height corresponds to a coronal pressure @xmath247 @xmath316 , which is typical for hot loops found in active regions , and equation ( [ eq : tmax ] ) yields a peak temperature @xmath317 mk .",
    "the vorticities of the driver modes are shown as function of time in figures [ fig : figure2]a and [ fig : figure2]b for the left ( @xmath2 ) and right ( @xmath3 ) footpoints , respectively .",
    "these random footpoint motions create alfvn waves that propagate upward along the flux tube .",
    "initially , only the two driver modes are present .",
    "the decrease of density with height causes the velocity amplitude of the waves to increase with height . in the chromosphere ,",
    "part of the wave energy is reflected back down due to the increase of alfvn speed with height .",
    "even stronger reflection occurs at the chromosphere - corona tr , where the alfvn speed suddenly increases by about a factor 15 .",
    "these reflections produce a pattern of counter - propagating waves in the photosphere and chromosphere at the two ends of the loop .",
    "the wave amplitudes in the chromosphere soon build up to about 20 - 30 km / s , consistent with the observations by @xcite .",
    "due to evolution of the driver modes and time delays in the reflection , the inward and outward propagating waves at a given height @xmath45 have different spatial distributions in the @xmath268 plane .",
    "furthermore , these patterns are superpositions of multiple modes with different perpendicular wavenumbers .",
    "such counter - propagating waves with different spatial patterns and multiple modes are subject to strong nonlinear interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in our rmhd model",
    ", these interactions are due to the bracket terms in equations ( [ eq : dhdt ] ) , ( [ eq : dodt ] ) and ( [ eq : dodt_pm ] ) . basically , the inward propagating waves are distorted by the outward propagating waves , and _ vice versa _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these distortions are large because the fluid displacements are comparable to the transverse scale of the waves . for example , for chromospheric waves with velocity amplitude of 10 km",
    "/ s acting over a period of 50 s , the transverse displacement is about 500 km , equal to the transverse scale of the driver modes . as a result of these nonlinear interactions , other wave modes with smaller spatial scales are excited ( see figure [ fig : func2 ] for a display of the 92 wave modes used in the present model ) .",
    "after about 200 s from the start of the simulation , a well - developed spectrum of alfvn waves has formed and dissipation of the high - wavenumber waves becomes significant .",
    "this dissipation is due to a combination of viscous and resistive diffusion effects , so the model includes the effects of magnetic reconnection .",
    "such turbulent dissipation of waves in the lower atmosphere continues throughout the simulation .",
    "a small fraction of the wave energy is transmitted through the tr into the corona .",
    "energy is injected into the coronal loop at both ends , producing counter - propagating waves in the corona . as in the chromosphere",
    ", the counter - propagating waves significantly distort each other because ( 1 ) they have different spatial patterns and ( 2 ) the fluid displacements are comparable to the transverse scale of the waves . therefore ,",
    "the waves produce turbulence in the corona , and there is a continual cascade of energy to smaller transverse scales . as a result , part of the alfvn wave energy is dissipated in the coronal part of the loop , again due to combination of viscous and resistive effects .",
    "we find that the rms velocity amplitude of the waves in the corona is similar to that in the upper chromosphere , but the energy dissipation rate in the corona is much lower because of the lower coronal density .    in the present model ,",
    "all of the dissipation occurs via alfvn wave turbulence , both in the chromosphere and in the corona .",
    "phase mixing and resonant absorption of alfvn waves play no role because these processes require variations in alfvn speed across the field lines , which are not included in the present model .",
    "a key feature of the model is that the photospheric footpoint motions include more than one driver mode , not just the torsional mode as in the simulations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "specifically , we use two driver modes ( modes @xmath318 and @xmath319 in figure [ fig : func2 ] ) with azimuthal mode number @xmath277 .",
    "if the system is driven using only a single mode ( e.g. , @xmath318 ) , all nonlinear terms in equations ( [ eq : dodt ] ) and ( [ eq : dhdt ] ) vanish . in this case",
    "all energy remains in the driver mode , and no turbulence develops , as we have verified in test calculations .",
    "hence , for alfvn wave turbulence to develop it is essential that the footpoint motions include multiple driver modes that have nonlinear couplings with high wavenumber modes .",
    "this coupling can be indirect ; for the chosen @xmath277 modes , the coupling runs via the @xmath320 modes .",
    "figure [ fig : figure2]c shows the spatially averaged energy density of the waves @xmath321 in the corona as function of time ( average between @xmath203 and @xmath322 ) .",
    "this quantity is the sum of magnetic free energy @xmath323 and kinetic energy @xmath324 , but the magnetic energy dominates .",
    "figure [ fig : figure2]d shows the spatially averaged heating rate @xmath325 per unit volume in the corona .",
    "note that both the energy density and the heating rate vary strongly with time .",
    "significant heating starts only after about 200 seconds when the waves have become sufficiently turbulent . during the latter part of the simulation ,",
    "the average heating rate in the coronal part of the loop is @xmath326 @xmath327 .",
    "this is consistent with the second rtv scaling law , equation ( [ eq : qcorrtv ] ) , which yields @xmath328 @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the reference model describes a coronal loop in which the average rate of plasma heating is balanced by radiative and conductive losses .",
    "the model represents the kind of hot , dense loops typically found in active regions .",
    "we conclude that such loops can be heated by alfvn wave turbulence generated inside the magnetic flux tubes by footpoint motions with rms velocity of about 1.5 km / s .",

    "the middle and right panels in figure [ fig : figure3 ] show the rms values of the velocity , vorticity , magnetic field fluctuation , and @xmath8 parameter .",
    "all four of these quantities are continuous at the tr .",
    "the rms velocity @xmath340 and rms magnetic field fluctuation @xmath308 are defined in equations ( [ eq : dvrms ] ) and ( [ eq : dbrms ] ) , and are further averaged over time .",

    "also note that the velocity at the mid - point is about 60% larger than that at the two trs ( vertical dashed lines in [ fig : figure3]b ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the waves in the corona are reflected back and forth between the trs several times before they decay , creating standing waves with nodes near the trs .",

    "we find that for the reference model only 7.7% of the available energy is dissipated in the corona ; the remainder is dissipated in the photosphere and chromosphere at the two ends of the coronal loop .",
    "the energy flux @xmath530 increases with the expansion factor , and so does the coronal power @xmath526 and the fraction @xmath532 .",
    "specifically , for @xmath533 about 16% of the available energy is dissipated in the corona . in contrast",
    ", the total dissipation rate @xmath525 is almost independent of the expansion factor .",
    "therefore , the heating of the lower atmosphere is apparently not sensitive to the properties of the coronal part of the loop .",
    "the results of table [ table3 ] show that , as @xmath237 increases , more energy enters into the corona and is dissipated at coronal heights .",
    "we suggest this increase is due to the fact that for large @xmath237 the alfvn speed at the midpoint of the coronal loop ( @xmath534 ) is drastically reduced compared to the case @xmath245 . as a result",
    ", it takes a longer time for the alfvn waves to travel through the corona , and this gives the waves more time to dissipate their energy in the corona via turbulent processes .",
    "the wave energy is distributed over a coronal volume @xmath529 that increases more rapidly with @xmath237 than the energy dissipation rate .",
    "therefore , the average heating rate @xmath37 in the corona decreases with increasing @xmath237 ( see table [ table3 ] ) .",

    "we suggest this relative constancy of the volumetric heating rate may be due to alfvn wave reflection within the corona . for large @xmath237 , the alfvn speed @xmath99 has a local minimum at the mid - point of the loop ( @xmath537 mm ) , and increases toward the ends . hence , as the alfvn waves travel from the midpoint to the ends of the loop , the waves are partially reflected before they reach the tr .",
    "this enhances the wave energy density in the central part of the loop , and gives the wave more time to be dissipated near the midpoint .",
    "clearly , wave reflections in the chromosphere , at the tr , and within the corona play an important role in determining the spatial distribution of the average heating rate @xmath335 .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the computed heating rates @xmath335 with those predicted from phenomenological turbulence models . in such models",
    "the fluctuations are expressed in terms of the elsasser variables , here defined as @xmath538 .",
    "the turbulent dissipation rate is given by equation ( 57 ) of @xcite : @xmath539 where @xmath540 is the outer scale of the turbulence , and the quantities @xmath541 are the rms values of the elsasser variables .",
    "the latter are averaged over the cross - section of the flux tube [ see equation ( [ eq : dzrms ] ) ] and over time .",
    "we compute @xmath541 for several models and find that the turbulence is significantly unbalanced ( @xmath542 ) , which is due to the strong dissipation in our models .",
    "the perpendicular length scale is set equal to the flux tube radius , @xmath543 .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio ] shows the ratio @xmath544 plotted as function of position along the flux tube for three values of the coronal loop expansion factor ( @xmath245 , 3 and 6 ) .",

    "we find that @xmath545 in the photosphere and low chromosphere , and the ratio peaks in the upper chromosphere , indicating the turbulence is more efficient there .",
    "for the reference model @xmath546 in the corona ( _ solid _ curve ) , similar to the value of 0.5 used by @xcite in their model of the solar wind .",
    "similar values for @xmath547 are found for the models with larger expansion factors ( the downward spikes just above the tr may be due to insufficient spatial resolution ) .",
    "we conclude that @xmath547 is significantly less than unity at all heights .",
    "according to the present model , the interactions of turbulent convective flows with kilogauss flux tubes in the photosphere produce transverse displacements of magnetic field lines on length scales less than the width of the flux tubes , i.e. , less than about @xmath5 km ( see figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "we assumed that the photospheric footpoint motions have velocity amplitudes in the range 1 - 2 km / s and correlation times of 60 - 200 s. we studied the dynamics of the alfvn waves produced by such footpoint motions , and found that such motions produce alfvnic turbulence at larger heights in the flux tube .",
    "the predicted dissipation rates of the turbulence as function of height are sufficient to reproduce the observed rates of chromospheric and coronal heating in active regions .",
    "we conclude that _ fine scale magnetic braiding can drive alfvnic turbulence and can produce sufficient heating for both the chromosphere and corona_. however , we should emphasize that we do not have any direct observational evidence for the existence of the assumed footpoint motions , as scales of @xmath5 km or less can not be resolved with present - day solar telescopes .",
    "therefore , our conclusion can be made only for the chosen values of the photospheric driver ; for higher or lower values the heating does not meet the observational constraints .",
    "our results indirectly provide a constraint on the amplitude of the footpoint motions necessary for the proposed mechanism to heat the chromosphere and corona .",
    "our model produces a coronal heating profile that is similar to that of a nanoflare storm @xcite in the spatial and temporal distribution of heating events , and in the final source of the energy released - dissipation of magnetic fields .",
    "the difference is that we have provided a fully self - consistent source for the nanoflare energy .",

    ", we considered a flux tube that extends from the photosphere through the chromosphere into the corona .",
    "we mainly considered closed coronal loops , and for simplicity we assumed that a single kilogauss flux tube at one end of the loop is connected to a single flux tube at the other end .",
    "therefore , we ignored the fact that on the real sun the photospheric flux concentrations at the two ends are uncorrelated and do not perfectly match up .",
    "furthermore , we assumed that the flux elements do not split up or merge during the simulation , so that the flux tube retains its identity .",
    "the pressure , density and magnetic field strength were taken to be fixed functions of position @xmath45 along the flux tube .",
    "the assumed structure of the lower atmosphere is based on model p by @xcite ; this model represents faculae in active regions ( i.e. , very bright plage ) .",
    "the chromosphere - corona tr was treated as a discontinuity where waves can reflect , and we neglected the gravitational stratification in the corona , so the pressure is constant along the coronal part of the loop .",
    "the dynamics of the waves and their structure in the plane perpendicular to the loop axis were described using the rmhd approximation @xcite , which assumes that the magnetic and velocity perturbations of the waves are perpendicular to the mean magnetic field of the flux tube .",
    "we found that the alfvn waves strongly reflect as they propagate through the chromosphere .",
    "this reflection is due to the increase of alfvn speed with height .",
    "even stronger reflection occurs at the tr where the alfvn speed suddenly increases by about a factor of 15 .",
    "these reflections produce in the chromosphere a pattern of counter - propagating waves that are subject to nonlinear wave - wave interactions .",
    "we found that the waves quickly decay into turbulence , causing most of the wave energy to be deposited in the lower atmosphere ( photosphere and chromosphere ) .",
    "only a small fraction of the wave energy is transmitted into the corona .",
    "energy is injected at both ends of the coronal loop , producing in the corona two sets of counter - propagating waves that reflect off the trs and decay into turbulence .",

    "we constructed a variety of loop models with different values of the model parameters .",

    "only a small fraction of the wave energy is dissipated in the corona ( about 7.7% ) , and the remainder is dissipated in the lower atmospheres at the two ends of the modeled loop .",
    "we computed the time - averaged heating rate @xmath335 and found that this rate decreases with height in the lower atmosphere from about 10 @xmath16 in the photosphere to about 0.2 @xmath16 in the upper chromosphere .",

    "the total losses over all wavelengths are in the range 1 - 2 @xmath16 , somewhat larger than the values found in the present model .",
    "therefore , our model may underestimate the amplitude of the alfvn waves and rate of energy dissipation in the chromosphere .    in the corona",
    "the reference model predicts @xmath549 @xmath16 , which is sufficient to explain the heating of typical active region loops .",
    "the predicted velocity amplitude of the alfvn waves in the corona is in the range 20 - 40 km / s , similar to the values found in observations of spectral line widths in active regions @xcite .",
    "we investigated how the coronal and chromospheric heating rates depend on the model parameters ( see section [ sect : depend ] ) .",

    "the increase of @xmath526 with @xmath237 is due to the decrease in the coronal alfvn speed , which lengthens the alfvn travel time in the corona and gives the waves more time to dissipate their energy via turbulence .",
    "the fraction of energy dissipated in the corona also increases with @xmath237 , but is still only about 16% for the model with @xmath533 .",
    "the average coronal heating rate @xmath37 decreases with @xmath237 , which is due to the fact that the coronal volume increases faster than the dissipated power @xmath526 .",

    "however , @xmath335 varies less than @xmath224 , so the heating is not strongly concentrated near the coronal base .",
    "this effect can be understood in terms of reflection of the waves by gradients of alfvn speed in the corona .",
    "observations of the active corona using the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the corona is highly dynamic and full of flows and wave phenomena ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this has led some authors to suggest that the heating of active region loops is localized in the low corona and involves energization processes that operate in the chromosphere and transition region @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite show that heating concentrated in the low corona would lead to thermal non - equilibrium of the plasma , and such non - equilibrium is not consistent with the observed properties of warm ( 1 - 2 mk ) loops observed in active regions . instead , they suggest coronal loops are heated impulsively by storms of nanoflares that are distributed throughout the coronal loop ( also see * ? ? ?",

    "the present model has some features in common with both types of models . on the one hand , we find that the average heating in the chromosphere is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude larger than that in the low corona , and that most of the heating occurs in the lower atmosphere , which is consistent with the ideas of @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the coronal part of the loop the heating depends only weakly on position , so the loop is likely to be thermally stable , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "although the present model was described in terms of the propagation and dissipation of alfvn waves , the waves reflect at various heights and undergo nonlinear interactions , producing twisted and braided fields similar to those found in previous braiding models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ". also , the model includes the effects of magnetic reconnection , and the time - dependent heating seen in figure [ fig : figure2]d can be thought of as a sequence of `` nanoflares '' @xcite .",
    "however , unlike in previous `` quasi - static '' braiding models the twisted structures are highly dynamic and are far from the force - free equilibrium state .",
    "for example , the twist parameter @xmath8 is not at all constant along the field lines ( see figure [ fig : figure3]f ) , as would be expected for a force - free state .",
    "this is due to the inclusion of the lower atmospheres at the two ends of the coronal loop , which produces turbulence in the chromosphere .",
    "also , the transverse motions of field lines at the photospheric base occur entirely _ inside _ the magnetic flux elements , hence these motions do not contribute to the `` random walk '' of the flux elements on the photosphere .",
    "this has the advantage that the velocity amplitudes can be relatively large , yet be consistent with observational constraints on the photospheric diffusion constant .    according to the present model , the transverse scale of the braids in the corona is very small , @xmath551 km , so the braids would likely not be observable with existing x - ray or euv telescopes .",
    "furthermore , the rms value of the transverse field fluctuations is small compared to the mean field , @xmath552 , so the mis - alignment angle between the field lines and the tube axis is only about @xmath553 .",
    "both the transverse scale of the braids and the mis - alignment angle are consistent with the fact that no braiding is observed in the corona on scales of several arcseconds or larger ( see section [ sect : obs ] ) .",
    "the mis - alignment angle is much smaller than that required in quasi - static braiding models that match the observed heating rate @xcite .",
    "we conclude that magnetic energy is injected into the corona via a dynamic ( not quasi - static ) braiding process .",
    "the existence of turbulence in coronal loops may have important implications for the damping of coronal loop oscillations and for the cross - field diffusion of electrons @xcite .    in the present paper",

    "both the velocity and the magnetic field perturbations must be continuous ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we require @xmath659 and @xmath660 . moreover , these conditions must be satisfied for any value of @xmath654 and @xmath655 .",
    "it follows that the coefficients @xmath657 are given by @xmath661 where @xmath662 is the ratio of alfvn speeds .",
    "the code was tested in various ways .",
    "we studied the propagation of alfvn wave packets in a uniform flux tube to verify that no wave dispersion occurs .",
    "we also considered nonuniform tubes and verified that energy is conserved in wave reflections .",
    "for the stratified loop we verified that the total wave energy ( integrated over the entire volume of the tube ) is constant in time when a wave packet is present in the initial conditions , the footpoints are held fixed , and the damping rate @xmath663 .",
    "this demonstrates that wave energy is conserved by the nonlinear interactions .",
    "for the full model we verified that the energy injected by footpoint motion minus the energy dissipated by damping equals the rate of change of the total energy to an accuracy of about 5% of the net input rate .",
    "we first derive expressions for the averages of vector quantities over the cross section of the flux tube . the rms velocity @xmath664 is given by @xmath665 where @xmath666 denotes the spatial average over the cross section of the tube . here",
    "we used partial integration to obtain @xmath183 ( @xmath667 ) , and we used equations ( [ eq : ortho ] ) , ( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : deriv2 ] ) . similarly ,",
    "the rms magnetic fluctuation @xmath668 is given by @xmath669 and the rms values of the elsasser variables are @xmath670 it follows from equations ( [ eq : dvrms ] ) and ( [ eq : dbrms ] ) that the contributions of mode @xmath373 to the velocity and magnetic power spectra are @xmath671 we now derive the energy equation in the context of the present model .",
    "the kinetic and magnetic energy densities are given by @xmath672 multiplying equation ( [ eq : dodt_k ] ) by @xmath673 and summing over @xmath373 , we obtain the following equation for the kinetic energy density : @xmath674 - q_{kin } , \\label{eq : ekin_dt}\\ ] ] where @xmath675 is the rate of kinetic energy loss due to damping : @xmath676 similarly , multiplying equation ( [ eq : dhdt_k ] ) by @xmath677 yields an equation for the magnetic energy density : @xmath678 - q_{mag } , \\label{eq : emag_dt}\\ ] ] where @xmath679 is the rate of magnetic energy loss : @xmath680 adding equations ( [ eq : ekin_dt ] ) and ( [ eq : emag_dt ] ) yields @xmath681 where @xmath682 is the total energy density , @xmath683 is the total dissipation rate , @xmath181 represent the diverging geometry of the background field , and @xmath684 is the alfvn wave energy flux averaged over the cross - section of the flux tube : @xmath685 note that the terms involving @xmath300 drop out of the energy equation ( [ eq : etot_dt ] ) . this is a result of equation ( [ eq : m6 ] ) , which shows that the matrix @xmath300 is anti - symmetric with respect to interchange of any two indices .",
    "therefore , the nonlinear terms in equations ( [ eq : dodt_k ] ) and ( [ eq : dhdt_k ] ) do not have a direct effect on energy transport along the tube , but they are of course responsible for exciting the high wavenumber modes that are subject to damping ( @xmath686 ) . therefore",
    ", our numerical scheme using basis functions @xmath573 is excellent for studying the energetics of the waves .",

    "<S> a three - dimensional mhd model for the propagation and dissipation of alfvn waves in a coronal loop is developed . </S>",

    "<S> the model describes the nonlinear interactions between alfvn waves using the reduced mhd approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of alfvn speed with height in the chromosphere and transition region ( tr ) causes strong wave reflection , which leads to counter - propagating waves and turbulence in the photospheric and chromospheric parts of the flux tube . </S>",
    "<S> part of the wave energy is transmitted through the tr and produces turbulence in the corona . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the hot coronal loops typically found in active regions can be explained in terms of alfvn wave turbulence , provided the small - scale footpoint motions have velocities of 12 km / s and time scales of 60200 s. the heating rate per unit volume in the chromosphere is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than that in the corona . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a series of models with different values of the model parameters , and find that the coronal heating rate increases with coronal field strength and decreases with loop length . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that coronal loops and the underlying chromosphere may both be heated by alfvnic turbulence . </S>"
