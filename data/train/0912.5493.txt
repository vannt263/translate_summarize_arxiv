    "it yields an estimate of the circular speed in each annulus , and has options to fit for , or hold fixed , the rotation centre , systemic velocity , position angle and inclination in each annulus .",
    "it is uniquely powerful in its ability to extract information when the gas layer is warped .",

    "velocity `` wiggles '' or larger - scale distortions of the isovelocity contours have long been recognized @xcite in well - sampled 2d velocity maps .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite show qualitatively that non - circular streaming in non - axisymmetric potentials can lead to a mis - estimation of the central attraction .",
    "note that @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite had previously published a number of quantitative models of non - circular flows that took this effect into account ; these papers used the additional information contained in the non - circular motions of strongly barred or spiral galaxies to separate the central attractions of the disc and halo .    not only do non - circular motions arise from bars and other visible distortions , but they may also be caused by expected asphericities in dark matter halos @xcite . because halos are largely pressure - supported , the principal axes of such distortions can slew only slowly with radius , and should appear approximately straight over a moderate radial range . even though halo shapes are expected to be made rounder by disk formation @xcite , gas in the outer discs",
    "is predicted to flow in an elliptical streaming pattern in response to forcing by a non - axisymmetric halo .",
    "@xcite argue that halo - driven non - axisymmetric streaming motions in the inner disc may mask a central cusp in the halo density .",
    "it is therefore desirable to be able to identify non - circular streaming motions in high - quality 2d velocity maps and to correct for their influence when deriving an estimate of the average central attraction .",

    "we have chosen to make this comparison using a few galaxies from the  @xcite sample , for which non - circular motions have recently been estimated using  by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) .",
    "in addition , we show that  can also be applied to optical data from a strongly barred galaxy in the bh@xmath0bar @xcite galaxy sample .",
    "in this section , we describe and compare the two separate software tools that are available for estimating the magnitudes of non - circular flows .",
    "the procedure proposed by @xcite , embodied in the tool , is an extension of  to include an harmonic analysis of the line - of - sight velocities around each ring .",
    "these authors use epicycle theory to interpret the fitted non - axisymmetric coefficients , and relate small values to the magnitude of the potential distortion .",
    "it should be noted that non - circular motions are readily confused with the kinematic signature of a warp , since both cause variations in the ellipticity and position angle of the flow pattern .",
    "thus , if the projection geometry is allowed to vary from ring to ring , then a large part of the actual non - circular motion may be masked by radial variations in the position angle ( pa ) and inclination ( @xmath1 ) . thus most users @xcite advocate constraining @xmath1 & pa to have the same values at all radii . on the other hand ,  justified allowing individual tilts for rings in all the  galaxies from the fact that the magnitudes of non - circular streaming motions in two galaxies ( ngc  3198 & ddo  154 ) were little changed when @xmath1 & pa were allowed to vary compared with when they were constrained to be constant with radius . here",
    "we show that allowing rings to tilt independently led them to miss non - axisymmetric distortions in at least two galaxies : ngc  2976 & ngc  7793 .",
    "the tool  has a number of disadvantages .    1 .",
    "a @xmath2 component in the projected velocities can arise from both @xmath3 $ ] distortions to the potential ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also ss07 and references therein ) , complicating the interpretation of the results .",
    "it assumes the perturbed velocities are small , and is therefore inadequate to characterize strongly non - axisymmetric flows .",
    "3 .   it makes no correction for the presence of non - circular motions . as a result , the estimated circular speed , @xmath4 ,",
    "is biased toward the value of the azimuthal speed on the major axis of the projection , as explained below .",
    "it treats each ring independently , implying that a mild distortion that is coherent over a significant radial range is more easily masked by noise .",
    "an estimate of the strength of the mild potential distortion responsible for the detected non - axisymmetric flow requires an undesirable difference between two of the fitted coefficients , a consequence of point ( i ) above , and also includes the sine of an angle whose value can not be determined from this approach .",
    "ss07 therefore proposed an alternative tool ,  illustrated in fig .",

    "the index @xmath23 ranges over @xmath24 , which is the total all three sets of velocities , @xmath25 , that define the model velocity ( eq .  [ pveleq ] ) around each of the ellipses .",
    "the weights @xmath26 , which include the trigonometric factors , also define the interpolation scheme that yields a model prediction at the projected position @xmath22 .",
    "the code allows the radial extent of the distortion to be restricted , if desired , while a simple axisymmetric flow is fitted over the remainder of the data .",
    "ss07 describe the algorithm in detail .",
    "we here use the term `` bar model '' to denote any straight bisymmetric distortion no matter what its origin or amplitude .",
    "[ schematic ] should not , however , be interpreted to imply that the code can fit only bars , or oval features , although that is its most useful application .",
    "the same code can be used to fit models having higher or lower rotational symmetry , @xmath27 , or axisymmetric ( @xmath28 ) radial flows .",
    "this tool avoids the above - listed disadvantages of the method devised by @xcite , as follows .    1 .   fitting a specific distorted flow model to the projected data avoids the complications caused by the coupling of different angular periodicities .",
    "2 .   it can fit for arbitrarily large distortions because it does not require @xmath13 & @xmath14 to be related by the epicycle approximation .",
    "it yields , which is an improved estimate of the average orbital speed at each radius , as discussed below .",
    "it uses all the data in a single fit , making it easier to identify coherent mild distortions in noisy data and to go some way towards `` averaging over '' small - scale spiral streaming .",
    "the magnitude of a mild potential distortion is much more directly related to the fitted velocity coefficients , as we show in section  [ epic ] .",
    "an elliptical flow pattern is clearly an idealization .",
    "it is a first - order improvement that captures the essential large - scale features of a bar - like flow , and will therefore be a better fit than a flat , axisymmetric model .",
    "it does not attempt to include other features , such as shocks in the bar , spiral arms , turbulence , warps , , that are also generally present in the data .",
    "the assumption of a flat disc plane is equivalent to requiring constant @xmath1 & pa in , which is the usual practice , except that  has the further advantage that it determines the optimal values as part of the fit .",
    "the inner parts of spiral galaxy discs are believed to be flat : warps are generally observed to start near the edge of the optical disc @xcite and theoretically we expect the massive inner disk to be coherent enough to resist bending @xcite .    with the projection angles held at constant values for all radii , it may seem from fig .  [ schematic ]",
    "that fitting a simple circular flow model ,  with , would yield the same  as a bisymmetric model from .",
    "however , the estimated circular speeds for an axisymmetric model are biased towards values on the major axis where the line - of - sight component of the orbital motion is greatest . since gas moving on elliptical orbits has its smallest orbital speed at apocentre , the fitted  is biased low when the streaming pattern is closely aligned with the major axis .",
    "conversely , we should expect an axisymmetric fit to be biased high by the higher - than - average speed of the gas near pericentre when the bar is oriented close to the projected minor axis , and to yield a fair estimate of  when the bar is at intermediate angles . recall that  is defined to be the average tangential velocity around a circle that may cross multiple streamlines , as shown in the strongly non - axismmetric flow sketched in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "thus even though  affords a fairer estimate of the central attraction than that from an axisymmetric fit , it is not the circular speed in the equivalent axisymmetric potential , unless the distortion is very mild .    because  fits each ring independently , it is not easy to apply a smoothing constraint to the fit .",
    "spiral arms , turbulence , , produce localized distortions to the flow that can lead to `` wiggles '' in the fitted velocities , as well as small - scale variations in @xmath29 , @xmath1 , & pa . the user of  can , and probably should , hold these global parameters fixed , but the tool does not have the option to smooth the fitted velocities .",
    "while excessive smoothing is clearly dangerous ,  it could reduce the slope of the inner rotation curve , a small degree of smoothing applied to constrain the fit can be beneficial . in appendix",
    "a we describe how an optional penalty can be applied within  to smooth the radial variations of the fitted functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 , & @xmath14 ; the magnitude of the penalty can be set independently for the axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric terms .",
    "the tool  assumes a straight position angle for the non - axisymmetric distortion , which has both advantages and disadvantages .",
    "since it can not follow the radial winding of a spiral pattern , it `` averages over '' the spirals ( advantage ( iv ) mentioned above ) and fits only straight distortions with @xmath27-fold rotational symmetry .",
    "its primary purpose therefore is to identify bar - like or oval distortions in the disk or halo .",
    "however , a fixed position angle precludes mapping the distorted flow of a spiral , which could be an interesting capability . it may be possible to adapt  to include extra parameters to fit a spiral of a certain shape , which we leave for possible future development .",
    "a weakness of  is that it tends to return absurd velocities when the bar angle , @xmath15 , is near zero or @xmath30 because a degeneracy arises between the velocity components at these special orientations . to see this ,",
    "consider equation ( [ pveleq ] ) for the predicted projected velocity when @xmath31 : the products @xmath32 and @xmath33 , can be separated into a part that varies as @xmath34 and another that varies as @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "therefore  is partly degenerate with both @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and a similar partial degeneracy arises when @xmath37 . in principle , the @xmath38 variation of the model breaks the degeneracy , but these more rapid angular variations are more susceptible to noise , and the `` best fit '' values of the three velocity components can be absurd .",
    "we show an example in section [ strong ] , where smoothing ( appendix a ) proves valuable in controlling this numerical artefact .",
    "the  code can be used to fit simultaneously for more than one type of distortion , but we have not obtained anything useful from attempting this . however , @xcite suspect both spiral perturbations and axisymmetric radial inflow in the central parts of ngc  1097 , and fit for both using a generalization of the method proposed by @xcite .    it should be noted that  is purely a fitting procedure .",
    "it does not , in general , yield a direct estimate of the potential responsible for the fitted velocity distortions , except when departures from axial symmetry are mild , as we show in the next section .",
    "where the fitted non - circular speeds are a small fraction of the circular speed , we can use epicycle theory to relate the fitted non - circular velocities to the strength of the non - axisymmetric perturbation .",
    "we can use the formulae for the orbits of test particles on near circular orbits in weakly barred potentials from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bt08 ) . their equation ( 3.147a , p190 )",
    "gives the forced radial displacement as a function of time , which can easily be differentiated to find the forced radial speed .",

    "since the neutral hydrogen clouds in a galaxy have typical random velocities of 6 - 12  km  s@xmath66 @xcite , we do not adopt the formal ( generally much smaller ) uncertainties in the intensity - weighted mean velocities , but instead assume a constant uncertainty of @xmath67 km  s@xmath66 .",

    "we also argue that while the current version of  assumes a flat plane for the inclined disc , this is no more restrictive , since tilts of individual rings in the bright inner part of the disk , as  allows , are dangerous and can lead to severe underestimation of the distorted velocities .",
    "this paper illustrates these advantages for a number of galaxies .",
    "we show that the  data @xcite for ngc  2976 can indeed be fitted by an inner bar - like distortion , albeit somewhat milder than that found by ss07 from h@xmath0+co data .",
    "we argue that a bar flow is more natural than either the radial flow fitted by @xcite or the twisted disk model of @xcite .",
    "as shown in ss07 , the improved mean orbital speed of the gas estimated from  is a fairer estimate than the simple mean fitted by tools such as .",
    "the difference , which arises from the bias to the velocity on the major axis , can be of either sign depending on the orientation of the bar to the major axis of projection .",
    "we also show that neutral hydrogen observations are not well suited to tracing gas dynamics in strongly barred potentials .",
    "the neutral hydrogen generally has a low column density in the barred region , and the velocity maps are generally too noisy or sparsely sampled to yield a clear indication of bar flow . smoothing to lower spatial resolution",
    "improves signal - to - noise , and yields an almost fully sampled velocity map throughout the bar region of ngc  2903 .",
    "we identify an oval flow pattern in these data of about the right physical size and with signifiant streaming velocities , but the large uncertainties imply they are also consistent with a round potential . however , a strong bar flow is unambiguously detected in our fit to the h@xmath0 velocity map of @xcite . while the superior spatial resolution of the optical data is clearly important , the generally patchy and faint emission from neutral hydrogen in the barred regions of this and other barred galaxies in the  sample suggest that neutral hydrogen is simply a poor tracer of bar flows .",
    "our analysis of the  data for ngc  3198 & ngc  2403 reaches a similar conclusion to that of : that the halos of these two galaxies are close to round .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that the self - consistent response of the disc can mask a large part of the distortion in the halo , but only when the disc is massive . in these two cases",
    ", the outer gas disc probably has little mass and therefore could not hide a more substantial halo distortion .",
    "however , it is hard to confront this result with the predictions of lcdm ( cited in the introduction ) : not only is it based on just two galaxies , but it is possible these two galaxies are unrepresentative perhaps because only galaxies with unusually round halos could host an extensive disc of gas that is not warped ! clearly , measurements of halo shapes in a representative galaxy sample will require a tool that can reliably measure potential distortions in warped discs ; we leave development of such a capability for future work .",
    "other statistical approaches @xcite do , however , place some reasonably tight constraints on halo shapes .",
    "thus , while we confirm the conclusion of  that many galaxies in the  sample have at most minor departures from axial symmetry ,  reveals that mild bars are present in ngc  2976 and ngc  7793 .",
    "we also show that a pronounced non - axisymmetric flow is revealed more clearly in other data for the strongly barred galaxy ngc  2903 .",
    "another valuable application for  will be a preliminary analysis of the velocity maps of strongly barred galaxies .",
    "it would be very helpful to obtain a clear indication of whether the flow pattern is , or is not , well enough sampled and sufficiently regular to yield a result , before embarking on laborious mass modeling by the method described by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a study needs approximate axisymmetric mass models , and the estimates of  from  will be more useful than the `` circular speed '' estimated from other less powerful tools .",

    "the value of the smoothing parameter , @xmath113 , which can be set independently for the axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric terms , can be adjusted as desired ; small values have slight effect , while large values make the profile very smooth .",
    "over - smoothing not only increases the value of @xmath65 , but may reduce the inner slope and smooth other real features in the rotation curve .    since the magnitude of the second velocity difference ( in square brackets ) varies as the inverse square of the ring spacing , @xmath114 , we choose @xmath115 , which ensures that the smoothing constraint is unaffected when the ring spacing is changed . here",
    ", @xmath116 is a constant that is a rough estimate of a typical orbital speed in the disc .",

    "completely random resampling of residuals assumes that the residuals are uncorrelated , whereas inspection of our residual images generally reveals coherent patterns of residual velocities due to features , such as other forms of non - axisymmetric streaming and large - scale turbulence , which are not included in our fitted model .",
    "pseudo - data constructed by fully random interchange eliminates correlations between the residuals and generally leads to unrealistically small uncertainties .",

    "the constant used to shift in radius is a randomly - chosen fraction of the radius of the map .",
    "we then reproject the new residual pattern , and assign a residual velocity at each pixel in the pseudo - data from that of the nearest pixel in the scrambled residual image .    when we fit for an axisymmetric model in part of the galaxy and include a non - axisymmetric perturbation over a limited radial region , we scramble the residuals within each of these parts separately , and do not interchange residuals between the separate regions , since the appearance of residual patterns in the two regions can differ quite markedly ."
