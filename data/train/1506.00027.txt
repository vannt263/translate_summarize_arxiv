    "quantum gravity based in einstein s theory of gravitation have been the subject of several papers over the last fifty years , including the seminal papers by feynman @xcite and dewitt @xcite .",
    "the quantum aspects of gravity coupled to scalar electrodynamics has also being discussed , for example , in @xcite , where the effective action was computed ( for a more comprehensive text , see @xcite ) .",
    "the theory is notoriously nonrenormalizable  @xcite , since it requires a set of infinite parameters to absorb all the divergences coming from the loop diagrams .",
    "the potential harm of a nonrenormalizability , however , can be overcome in the effective field theory ( eft ) framework , where there is a unambiguous way to define a well behaved and reliable quantum theory of general relativity , if only we agree to restrict ourselves to low energies compared to the planck scale  @xcite . in the core of eft argument",
    "is the fact that if we respect all the symmetry of the problem to write down in the lagrangian all the terms that contribute to a process of energy scale @xmath0 , all new terms eventually required by the renormalization procedure can be neglected because they must contribute only to higher energy processes .",
    "this eft s methods has been used to compute several gravitational corrections ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    motivated by this modern view of quantum gravity , robinson and wilczek  @xcite considered a non - abelian gauge field coupled to gravity and found the gravity contributes with a negative term to the beta function of the gauge coupling , meaning that quantum gravity could make gauge theories asymptotically free",
    ". the origin of this effect would be the arising of quadratic uv divergences , associated to the one graviton exchange graph , that could be absorbed in a gauge coupling constant redefinition .",
    "this remarkable conclusion motivated a lot of research on the subject .",
    "a few months after robinson - wilczek s paper , their conclusion was questioned by pietrykowski , who repeated their calculation for an abelian field and reproduced their result _ for a particular gauge choice _ , but showed that a different gauge could lead to no gravitational contribution at all  @xcite .",
    "pietrykowski also suggest at the end of ref .",
    "@xcite that if dimensional regularization is applied , the quadratic divergence would not be present , and that claim was investigated further by felipe _",
    "et al _ in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is argued that the gravitational correction to the beta function computed in  @xcite is regularization dependent and therefore ambiguous .",
    "the absence of gravitational correction at one - loop order was reinforced by ebert , plefka and rodigast in a paper where they follow diagrammatic approach using both a cut - off and a dimensional regularization  @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the use of the vilkovisky - dewitt method to this problem was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where nielsen shows for the einstein - maxwell system that quadratic divergences would break the ward identities , so the method would guarantee only the gauge invariance of finite and logarithmic divergent parts of the effective action .",
    "the role of the cosmological constant was also investigated and the result was that it should induce an asymptotic freedom behavior to the electric charge  @xcite and for @xmath1 model  @xcite .",
    "there has been also some results for other ( nongauge ) interactions , for example , it was argued that massive particles with yukawa  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite share the same property of asymptotic freedom , an effect that vanishes when the masses are withdrawn .",
    "the controversy about the beta function calculations is still unresolved , and some works question the physical meaning of the definition of the running coupling constants  @xcite , and these papers argue that a scattering matrix computation is needed to give a physical definition for the running of the coupling constants . using s - matrix ,",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that an attempt to compute the running of the yukawa coupling can be ambiguous , since it would seem to run in the direction of asymptotic freedom in one process , but will increase with energy for another process , and therefore what appears to be asymptotic freedom is not an universal behaviour within the theory .",
    "this conclusion is intrinsically related to the construction and meaning of an effective theory : the gravitational corrections will not renormalize the original operator , but rather a higher derivative one ( because of the dimensional coupling constant ) and different processes typically involve different combinations of operators and no universality is to be expected  @xcite . through the computation of scattering processes , it was shown that quantum gravitational corrections do not alter the running behavior of the electric charge in the massless scalar qed  @xcite , but the presence of a positive cosmological constant in the massless einstein-@xmath1 model corroborates earlier proposal@xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the renormalization of the effective field theory of the massive scalar electrodynamics coupled to einstein s gravity , showing that gravitational corrections do not alter the running behavior of the electric charge , even in the presence of massive particles .",
    "this is done by the computation of scattering amplitudes between charged particles .",
    "the model is given by the following action @xmath3    where @xmath4 assume values @xmath5 and @xmath6 according to the flavor of the pion , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the planck mass and @xmath9 the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath10 is the electric charge and @xmath11 a self interaction constant .",
    "@xmath12 is the gauge - fixing plus faddeev - popov ghost lagrangian ( for the graviton and the photon ) and @xmath13 is the lagrangian of counterterms .",
    "finally , @xmath14 is the lagrangian of higher derivatives terms given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for omitted higher order terms , which are not important to our analysis in this paper",
    ".    we must keep in mind that for renormalized lagrangian we have redefined @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the relation between bare and renormalized coupling constants",
    "are given by @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a mass scale introduced by the dimensional regularization with @xmath21 .",
    "let us consider small fluctuations around the flat metric , i.e. , @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ". for more details see for instance  @xcite .    through the harmonic gauge - fixing function , @xmath26 , the graviton propagator can be cast as @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 .",
    "the propagators for the other fields are also obtained by the usual faddeev - popov method , resulting in @xmath29,\\\\ \\langle t~\\phi^*_i(p ) \\phi_j(-p)\\rangle & = & \\delta_{ij}(p)=\\frac{i}{p^2-m^2}\\delta_{ij}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the ghost propagators are not useful in the order we are working.the above propagators were written for generic gauge parameters : @xmath30 and @xmath31 . since our interest is in the study of gauge independent quantities , from now on , we will restrict to the feynman gauges , @xmath32 , which simplifies the very long calculations involved .",
    "reproduction of the same results by calculating with generic parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 would be desirable , but we will leave it for future investigations .",
    "the self - energy process of the scalar particle , figure [ se1 ] , is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the one - loop correction given by @xmath35    using the ms renormalization scheme  @xcite , the counterterms for mass ( @xmath36 ) and wave - function ( @xmath37 ) are given by @xmath38    the one - loop correction to the polarization tensor of the photon field , figure [ se2 ] , is @xmath39    where @xmath40 , see for instance  @xcite , is a high order gravitational correction which only contributes to the renormalization of a high order operator . from the above expression we find the photon wave - function counterterm as @xmath41    the scattering amplitude @xmath42 , figures [ scat01 ] and [ scat02 ] , is given by @xmath43    for convenience , we have set @xmath44 at tree level . in the above expression , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the mandelstam variables , @xmath48 is the expression for the counterterms @xmath49    and @xmath50 the one - loop correction . to compute @xmath50 up to order of @xmath51 ( one - graviton exchange )",
    ", we used a set of mathematica@xmath52 packages  @xcite and found : @xmath53    we use also eq .",
    "( [ ctm ] ) to write the amplitude ( [ amp01 ] ) as @xmath54    the kinematical identity @xmath55 can then be used to eliminate @xmath45 from @xmath56 in order to simplify the analysis . collecting terms with the same kinematical factor",
    ", we have @xmath57    imposing finiteness , we find @xmath58    since @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 . therefore , the beta function of the electric charge is @xmath62 which is simply the usual beta function in absence of gravity , so we can say that quantum gravitational corrections do not alter the running behavior of the electric charge .    on the other hand , for the renormalization of @xmath11 , we find @xmath63 and we see that we can not separate the contributions for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this arbitrariness in the definition of the coupling constants is due to the mixing of operators , typical in effective field theories , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the separation of the renormalization of @xmath11 and @xmath66 would require the study of off - shell processes where these two parameters , or at least one of them , are involved .",
    "for the moment , we will not pursuit this analysis .",
    "in summary , we have shown that massive scalar qed coupled to gravity is renormalizable within the framework of effective field theory .",
    "the appropriate counterterms were set by imposing finiteness of the scattering amplitude at one - loop order .",
    "our attention was focused on the gravitational correction to the renormalization of the coupling constants , since previous works have indicated that the presence of a dimensionful parameter ( the cosmological constant in @xcite ) might render a non - vanishing new term .",
    "we found that the counterterm for the electric charge does receive a gravitational contribution in the presence of a dimensionful parameter ( the mass of the scalars ) .",
    "however , this dependence on @xmath51 is exactly canceled when we compute @xmath67 , such that , the running of the electric charge is not altered by gravitational effects , similarly to what was observed in massless qed coupled to gravity@xcite .    on the other hand , the counterterms for the scalar coupling constants",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath66 will depend on the gravitational coupling @xmath51 in the case considered ( @xmath68 ) and can not be separated , a manifestation of what is called mixing of operators ( typical of effective field theories , as discussed in  @xcite ) .",
    "their separation would requires the study of off - shell processes involving these coupling constants . for the moment",
    ", we will not pursuit this analysis .",
