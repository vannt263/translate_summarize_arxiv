    "high statistical accuracy in modern eas experiments in the knee region encouraged the investigation of the fine structure of eas size spectra . although the origin of the knee is still a matter of debate , recently the series of publications @xcite appeared , where the sharpness and the spectral structure in the knee region were interpreted by the contribution of heavy nuclei from a single local supernova .",
    "along with this , the absolute differential eas size spectra measured at different atmosphere depths and different zenith angles are not explained yet from the point of view of a single @xmath7 interaction model and a single model of primary energy spectra and elemental composition .",
    "such an attempt has been made in @xcite based on the qgs interaction model and rigidity - dependent steepening primary energy spectra @xcite for a description of vertical msu , akeno and tien - shan eas size spectra . in the present work we worked out a formalism of the inverse problem solution - reconstruction of the primary energy spectrum and elemental composition based on the known eas size spectra of kascade @xcite , akeno @xcite , eas - top @xcite and ani @xcite measured at different zenith angles .",
    "the calculations were done in the frames of qgsjet @xcite and sibyll @xcite interaction models . as a primary spectrum",
    "we have tested the modified rigidity - dependent steepening primary energy spectra and the hypothesis of the additional component in the knee region @xcite . in this case",
    "the type of nucleus of the additional component was considering as unknown and determining by the best fit of the fine structure of eas size spectra in the knee region .",
    "in general , the energy spectra ( @xmath8 ) of primary nuclei ( @xmath9 ) and detectable eas size spectra ( @xmath10 ) are related by the integral equation - @xmath11 where @xmath12 are energy , nucleon number ( 1 - 59 ) and average zenith angle of primary nuclei , @xmath13 is an energy threshold of detected eas electrons , @xmath14 is the estimation value of eas size obtained by the electron lateral distribution function . here , by the eas size ( @xmath15 ) we mean the total number of eas electrons at given observation level @xmath16 .",
    "the kern ( @xmath17 ) of integral equation ( 1 ) is determined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an eas size spectrum at the observation level @xmath16 for given @xmath20 parameters of a primary nucleus and depends on @xmath7 interaction model ; @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is a probability to detect an eas by scintillation array at eas core coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 and to obtain the estimations of eas parameters ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 - shower age , @xmath27 - shower core location ) with given accuracies ; @xmath28 is a distribution of @xmath29 for given eas size ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "+ one may achieve significant simplification of equation ( 1 ) providing the following conditions during experiments : + a ) selection of eas cores in a range where @xmath31 , + b ) the log - gaussian form of the measuring error ( @xmath32 ) with an average value @xmath33 and a rmsd @xmath34 , where @xmath35 involves all transfer factors ( an energy threshold of detected eas electrons , @xmath36 and @xmath37 contributions ) and slightly depends on @xmath38 and @xmath9 , + c ) transformation ( standardization ) of the measured eas size spectra to the eas size spectra at observation level @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the eas size power index , + d ) consideration of either all - particle primary energy spectrum @xmath42 with effective nucleus @xmath43 or energy spectra of primary nuclei ( @xmath44 ) gathered in a limited number of groups ( @xmath45 ) as unknown functions .",
    "+ ( a - d ) conditions make eas data of different experiments more comparable and equation ( 1 ) converts to the form @xmath46 or @xmath47 however , even in this form the determination of primary energy spectra by measured eas size spectra and solution of integral equations ( 2,3 ) in general is unsolvable problem . at the same time , using the a priori information about energy spectra of primary nuclei ( @xmath48 ) and the eas size spectra @xmath49 measured in @xmath50 size intervals and @xmath51 zenith angular intervals , one may transform the inverse problem into @xmath52-minimization problem @xmath53 with unknown ( free ) spectral parameters . here",
    "@xmath54 are the expected eas size spectra determined at the right hands of equations ( 1 - 3 ) and @xmath55 are the uncertainties ( rmsd ) of measured ( @xmath56 ) and expected ( @xmath57 ) shower size spectra .",
    "+ one may also unify the data of different experiments applying minimization @xmath58 with re - normalized eas size spectra @xmath59 where index @xmath60 determines the observation levels ( @xmath61 ) of experiments .",
    "expression ( 5 ) offers an advantage for experiments where the values of methodical shift ( @xmath35 ) and measuring error ( @xmath34 ) are unknown or known with insufficient accuracy .",
    "+ the energy spectra of primary nuclei are preferable to determine ( a priori ) in the following generalized form @xmath62 unknown ( free ) spectral parameters in approximation ( 6 ) are @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( so called `` knee '' of energy spectrum of @xmath9 nucleus ) , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( spectral asymptotic slopes before and after knee ) , @xmath67 ( sharpness parameter of knee , @xmath68 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 parameters are known from approximations of balloon and satellite data @xcite at @xmath71 and @xmath72 tev .",
    "parameter @xmath73 determines the normalization of spectra ( 6 ) in @xmath74 tev energy range .",
    "+ thus , minimizing @xmath75- functions ( 4,5 ) on the basis of measured values of @xmath76 and corresponding expected eas size spectra ( 2,3 ) at given @xmath77 zenith angular intervals , @xmath78 eas size intervals and @xmath79 experiments one may evaluate the parameters of the primary spectrum ( 6 ) .",
    "evidently , the accuracies of solutions for spectral parameters strongly depend on the number of measured intervals ( @xmath80 ) , statistical errors and correctness of @xmath81 determination in the framework of a given interaction model .",
    "here , the parametric solutions of the eas inverse problem are obtained on the basis of kascade @xcite ( @xmath821020 g/@xmath83 ) , akeno @xcite ( 910 g/@xmath83 ) , eas - top @xcite ( 810 g/@xmath83 ) and ani @xcite ( 700 g/@xmath83 ) published eas size spectra .",
    "these experiments were carried out at different observation levels and were chosen for two reasons : satisfaction of ( a - c ) conditions from the section ( 2 ) and a high statistical accuracy of presented data ( especially kascade experiment ) .",
    "unfortunately , during the standardization of eas size spectra ( condition ( c ) ) the value of @xmath84 parameter is not always known with proper accuracy , which is the main reason of discrepancy in the results of different experiments . in our calculations",
    "we included @xmath84 in the list of unknown spectral parameters and determined by the minimization of functional ( 4 ) .",
    "the problem does not exist if the minimization of re - normalized eas size spectra is unified , since the linear parameters ( @xmath85 ) are canceled out from the functional ( 5 ) .",
    "+ the differential eas size spectra @xmath86 for given @xmath87 pev , @xmath88 , @xmath89 kg/@xmath83 , @xmath90 were calculated using corsika562(nkg ) eas simulation code @xcite at qgsjet @xcite and sibyll @xcite interaction models .",
    "intermediate values are calculated using 4-dimensional log - linear interpolations .",
    "the estimations of errors of the expected eas size spectra @xmath91 at fixed @xmath92 parameters did not exceed @xmath93 .",
    "+ the basic results of minimizations ( 4,5 ) at a given number ( @xmath94 ) of unknown spectral parameters and the values of @xmath95 ( or @xmath96 for unified data ) , are presented in tables  1 - 4 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are corresponding degrees of freedom .",
    "the upper ( lower ) rows of each experiment in tables  1 and 4 correspond to parameters obtained by the qgsjet ( sibyll ) interaction model .",
    "table  1 contains the approximation values of spectral parameters at rigidity - dependent approach @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a charge of @xmath9 nucleus and r is a parameter of magnetic rigidity ( or a critical ( cutoff ) energy in more modern model @xcite ) .",
    "the results were obtained by minimizations ( 4,5 ) applying ( 6,7 ) .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath101 for all nuclei were taken from @xcite .",
    "the number of unknown ( free ) parameters is equal to @xmath102 and corresponding solutions at two interaction models are presented in table  1 .",
