    "ion - atom ionizing collisions play an important role in many applications , such as heavy ion inertial fusion @xcite , collisional and radiative processes in the earth s upper atmosphere @xcite , ion - beam lifetimes in accelerators @xcite , atomic spectroscopy @xcite and ion stopping in matter @xcite , and are also of considerable academic interest in atomic physics @xcite .    to estimate the ionization and stripping rates of fast ions propagating through gas or plasma , the values of ion - atom ionization cross sections are necessary .",
    "in contrast to the electron @xcite and proton @xcite ionization cross sections , where experimental data or theoretical calculations exist for practically any ion and atom , the knowledge of ionization cross sections by fast complex ions and atoms is far from complete @xcite . while specific values of the cross sections for various pairs of projectile ions and target atoms have been measured at several energies @xcite , the scaling of cross sections with energy and target or projectile nucleus charge has not been experimentally mapped .",
    "there are several theoretical approaches to cross section calculations .",
    "these include : classical calculations that make use of a classical trajectory and the atomic electron velocity distribution functions given by quantum mechanics [ this approach is frequently referred to as the classical trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) approach ] ; quantum mechanical calculations based on the born , eikonal or quasiclassical approximations , and so forth @xcite .",
    "all approaches are computationally intensive , and the error and range of validity have to be assessed carefully before making any approximations or applying the results .",
    "classical trajectory calculations are simpler to perform in comparison with quantum mechanical calculations . moreover , in some cases the ctmc calculations yield results close to the quantum mechanical calculations our pop hif , mueller new , our new .",
    "the reason for similar results lies in the fact that the rutherford scattering cross section is identical in both classical and quantum mechanical derivations @xcite .",
    "therefore , when an ionizing collision is predominantly a consequence of electron scattering at small impact parameters close to the nucleus , the quantum mechanical uncertainty in the scattering angle is small compared with the angle itself , and the classical calculation can yield an accurate description @xcite .",
    "but this is not always a case , as we demonstrate below . for fast projectile velocities and low ionization potentials",
    ", the difference between the classical and quantum mechanical calculations of ionization cross section can be as large as a factor of six for parameters to relevant to heavy ion fusion cross sections .    in the present analysis , we consider at first only the stripping cross section of loosely bound electron orbitals of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ions colliding with a neutral atom of nitrogen , or with a fully stripped nitrogen ion with @xmath4 ( for comparison ) .",
    "atomic units are used throughout this paper with @xmath5 , which corresponds to length normalized to @xmath6 velocity normalized to @xmath7 , and energy normalized to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the rydberg energy .",
    "the normalizing coefficients are retained in all equations for robust application of the formulas .",
    "for efficient manipulation of the formulas , it is worth noting that the normalized velocity is @xmath10 } $ ] , where @xmath11 is energy per nucleon in @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 corresponds to the atomic velocity scale .",
    "the typical scale for the electron orbital velocity with ionization potential @xmath14 is @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is the standard notation for the main quantum number and the orbital angular momentum quantum number @xcite .",
    "the collision dynamics is very different depending on whether @xmath17 is smaller or larger than @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath20 , the projectile interaction with the target atom occurs for a very short time , and the interaction time decreases as the velocity increases . for @xmath21 @xmath2 ions , envisioned for heavy ion fusion applications ,",
    "the projectile velocity in atomic units is @xmath22 , while the electron orbital velocity is @xmath23 for the first ( @xmath24 ) ionization potential of @xmath2 , and @xmath25 for the first ( @xmath26 ) ionization potential of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we shall use the limit @xmath20 .    in the limit , where @xmath27 and @xmath20 , the born approximation of quantum mechanics can be used @xcite .",
    "the first inequality assures that the nitrogen atomic potential can be taken into account as a small perturbation ( the born approximation ) ; the second inequality allows us to use the unperturbed atomic wave function .     in eq.([p quantum ] ) , and @xmath28 in eq.([p classical mechanics ] ) ] and the effective charges [ @xmath29 @xmath30 in eq.([z quantum ] ) , and @xmath31 in eq.([z cl effective ] ) ] in quantum and classical mechanics for @xmath21 @xmath32 ions colliding with a nitrogen atom .",
