    "we study a system of branching random walks known as the frog model , and we discover a phase transition as the initial state becomes more saturated with particles .",
    "similar phase transitions have been observed in related models , including activated random walk @xcite , reinforced random walk @xcite , killed branching random walk @xcite and the contact process @xcite .",
    "the frog model starts with a single particle awake at the root of a graph and sleeping particles at the other vertices .",
    "the initial configuration of sleeping particles can be deterministic or random .",
    "particles that are awake perform independent simple random walks in discrete time .",
    "when a vertex with sleeping particles is first visited , all of the particles at the site wake up and each begins its own walk .",
    "the name `` frog model '' was coined in 1996 by rick durrett ; we continue the zoomorphism and refer to the particles as frogs . as with other interacting particle systems ,",
    "the frog model is often motivated as a model for the spread of a rumor or infection ( see @xcite , e.g. ) .",
    "it and its variants have also found interest as models of combustion @xcite , generally with particles moving in continuous time .",
    "we call a realization of the frog model _ recurrent _ if the root is visited infinitely often by frogs and _ transient _ if not",
    ". even if each individual frog is transient , the aggregate of visits to the root can still be infinite .",
    "for this reason , the transience or recurrence of the frog model gives a measurement of its growth , and the question of transience or recurrence for the frog model on a given graph is one of the most fundamental ones .",
    "the first ever published result on the frog model is that it is recurrent on @xmath1 with one sleeping frog per site for all @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the frog model on @xmath2 is recurrent for any i.i.d .",
    "initial configuration of sleeping frogs @xcite .",
    "it is natural to wonder if a sparser configuration changes the behavior .",
    "@xcite exhibits a threshold at which a frog model with @xmath3 frogs at each @xmath4 switches from transience to recurrence .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs when the walks have a bias in one direction : @xcite finds that on @xmath5 , the model is recurrent if and only if the number of sleeping frogs per site has infinite logarithmic moment .",
    "recently , this result was partially extended to @xmath1 in @xcite and worked out in finer detail in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the full infinite @xmath0-ary tree , in which the root has degree  @xmath0 and all other vertices degree  @xmath7 .",
    "the question of transience or recurrence on @xmath6 is especially subtle . on one hand , the number of sleeping frogs grows exponentially with the distance from the root . on the other hand ,",
    "each frog that wakes up has a drift away from the root ; its probability of visiting the root shrinks exponentially as the starting vertex of the frog moves outward .",
    "the question of whether @xmath6 is transient for the one - per - site model is posed in @xcite and again in @xcite and @xcite . surprisingly , the answer depends on the degree of the tree . in @xcite , we prove that the one - per - site frog model is recurrent on the binary tree and transient on @xmath0-ary trees with @xmath8 .",
    "we conjecture that the one - per - site frog model is recurrent for @xmath9 and transient for @xmath10 .",
    "while we would like to pin this down and complete the picture of transience and recurrence for the one - per - site frog model on trees , we believe that the most interesting aspect of this work is that the frog model on trees is teetering on the edge between recurrence and transience .",
    "the point of this paper is to demonstrate this more precisely .",
    "we consider the frog model on @xmath6 with i.i.d . @xmath11 sleeping frogs at each site . our result is a phase transition between recurrence and transience as @xmath12 varies .",
    "[ thm1 ] consider the frog model on a @xmath0-ary tree with @xmath13 sleeping frogs per site .",
    "for all @xmath14 , there exists a critical value @xmath15 such that the model is recurrent a.s . if @xmath16 and transient a.s .",
    "if @xmath17 . the critical value satisfies @xmath18 for some constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    by a straightforward coupling , the probability of recurrence is monotone in @xmath12 .",
    "by @xcite , theorem  4 , the probability of recurrence is either @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "the theorem is then an immediate consequence of propositions  [ proprecurrence ] and  [ proptransience ] , where we prove recurrence and transience , respectively .",
    "contrast our result with the frog model on @xmath1 , which is recurrent for any i.i.d .",
    "configuration of sleeping frogs @xcite . to show the existence of the recurrence phase",
    ", we consider a restricted process that lets us take advantage of the recursive structure of @xmath6 .",
    "we then use a bootstrapping argument , showing that the number of returns to the root is stochastically larger and larger at each step .",
    "we establish the transience phase essentially by dominating the model with a branching random walk , using a similar argument as in @xcite . as in that paper ,",
    "the most difficult part is recurrence .",
    "our result is an advance in that we are able to show recurrence on any @xmath0-ary tree with enough sleeping frogs . in @xcite , we prove recurrence only for @xmath23 , and the proof does not apply to a general choice of @xmath0 ; even extending it to @xmath9 seems difficult . the argument here relies on having poisson many sleeping frogs at each site , however , and thus neither result implies the other . a more detailed comparison between the recurrence proofs in the two papers is in section  [ subseccomparison ] .      a nice general survey on the frog model can be found in @xcite . here , we pose four questions specifically related to the frog model on trees .",
    "the question most directly related to our paper is to better estimate the critical value @xmath24 .",
    "we are interested in both the asymptotic behavior and precise values for small @xmath0 .    what is the correct order of @xmath24 as @xmath25 ? also , what is the value of @xmath24 for small @xmath0 ?",
    "we suspect that @xmath26 . as for the second question , the best bounds we can prove for @xmath23 are @xmath27 ( see section  [ subseccomparison ] ) . as a start at considering the frog model on less regular graphs",
    ", we would like to know if the analogue of our result holds on galton  watson trees .",
    "consider a frog model with @xmath13 frogs at each site of an infinite galton ",
    "watson tree .",
    "as @xmath12 varies , does a phase transition occur between transience and recurrence ?",
    "we are also interested in the relationship between the frog model and the degree distribution of the tree .",
    "does the recurrence of the frog model on a galton  watson tree depend on the entire degree distribution or just the maximal degree ? concretely , consider a one - per - site frog model on a galton  watson tree where each vertex has probability @xmath28 of having two children and probability @xmath29 of having five children .",
    "@xcite , theorem  1 implies that this is recurrent when @xmath30 and transient when @xmath31 .",
    "is it recurrent for any @xmath32 ?",
    "this dependence on the maximal degree of the tree alone is seen in the contact process ( see @xcite and @xcite , proposition  2.5 ) .",
    "our next question comes from itai benjamini and concerns the frog model on finite trees .",
    "define the _ cover time _ to be the expected time for every frog to wake up in a one - per - site frog model on the full @xmath0-ary tree with height  @xmath33 .",
    "we call this the cover time since it is equivalent to the time when every site is visited",
    ". a naive bound on the cover time is @xmath34 , the expected time for a single random walk to visit every site , as shown in @xcite .",
    "we have an unpublished proof improving this to @xmath35 , but we suspect the correct value is polynomial .    is the cover time for the one - per - site frog model on a @xmath0-ary tree of height  @xmath33 polynomial in @xmath33 ?",
    "possibly the cover time on finite trees relates to the recurrence and transience properties on the corresponding infinite tree .",
    "for instance , it would be exciting to see that the cover time is polynomial in the height of the tree for @xmath23 but exponential for higher @xmath0 .",
    "this would be reminiscent of the contact process , which behaves similarly on finite lattices and trees as on their infinite counterparts @xcite .",
    "we start with a sketch .",
    "let @xmath36 be the law of the number of visits to the root in the frog model with @xmath13 frogs at each site .",
    "to get some regularity , we restrict the motion of awakened frogs to the nonbacktracking component of their ranges . call this the _ nonbacktracking frog model _",
    "( more details are in section  [ secnonbacktracking ] ) and let @xmath37 be the law of the number of visits to the root in this model .",
    "a coupling argument in proposition  [ propbacktrackingcoupling ] confirms the intuition that @xmath38 here , @xmath39 denotes _ stochastic dominance _ ,",

    "visits @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "suppose at most one frog in the nonbacktracking frog model is allowed to enter each @xmath44 and only frogs woken at @xmath42 and emerging from @xmath45 can enter other subtrees .",
    "we see in lemma  [ lemfixedpoint ] that the number of visits to @xmath46 is stochastically fewer than @xmath37 and is distributed as @xmath47 . ]    in section  [ secadef ] , we define an operator @xmath48 under which the image of @xmath37 has an interpretation in an even more restricted frog model .",
    "first , a bit of notation ( see figure  [ figtree ] ) is necessary .",
    "say the initial nonbacktracking frog moves down the tree from the root @xmath46 to @xmath42 and then to @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath49 be the other children of @xmath42 and let @xmath44 denote the subtree rooted at @xmath50 .",
    "the measure @xmath51 is the law of the number of visits to the root in the nonbacktracking frog model with two further restrictions :    at most one frog can enter @xmath44 for each @xmath52 .",
    "only frogs woken at @xmath42 and those emerging from @xmath53 can enter the other @xmath44 .",
    "the advantage of ( i ) is that it makes the number of frogs emerging from the activated subtrees i.i.d .",
    "random variables .",
    "the advantage of ( ii ) is that it simplifies which subtrees become activated ( see lemma  [ lemfirstwavecondition ] ) . intuitively , these restrictions reduce the number of visits to the root .",
    "this is made rigorous in lemma  [ lemfixedpoint ] where we prove that @xmath54 we stress that this a special property of @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , the essence of our argument is to show that when @xmath12 is large enough , ( [ eqcontraction ] ) can hold only if @xmath55 .",
    "section  [ secaproperties ] explores properties of @xmath48 . in lemma  [ lemmonotonicity ]",
    ", we show that @xmath48 is monotonic , meaning that for two probability measures @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 lemma  [ lemmixture ] shows that @xmath48 acts nicely on the poisson distribution .",
    "in fact , by writing the poisson distribution in a nonstandard way ( see lemma  [ lempoidivision ] ) , we can compare @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "we carry this out in proposition  [ proppoisson ] , where we show that when @xmath61 , there exists @xmath62 such that @xmath63 for all @xmath64 .",

    "proving ( [ eqpoisson ] ) reduces to comparing two binomial distributions with parameters depending on @xmath12 .",

    ", we will carry out this plan and prove statements ( [ eqdominance])([eqpoisson ] ) .",

    "we also use the notation @xmath71 to indicate that the law of @xmath72 is stochastically dominated by the law of @xmath73 . an equivalent condition to stochastic dominance",

    "a thorough reference on stochastic domination is @xcite .    for a nonnegative random variable @xmath79",
    ", we use @xmath80 to denote a mixture of poisson distributions ; when we write @xmath81 , we mean that @xmath72 is coupled with @xmath79 such that the distribution of @xmath72 conditional on @xmath82 is @xmath83 . if @xmath84 , we also use @xmath85 to denote the same poisson mixture .",
    "we similarly use the notation @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "a _ random nonbacktracking walk _ on @xmath6 starting at a vertex @xmath88 moves in its first step to a uniformly random neighbor of @xmath88 . in all subsequent steps ,",
    "it moves to a vertex chosen uniformly from all its neighbors except for the one it just arrived from .",

    "( if @xmath88 is the root , then it is never stopped . )",
    "define the _ nonbacktracking frog model _ just as the usual frog model , except that the motion of a frog waking at @xmath88 is an independent copy of @xmath90 , rather than a simple random walk .",
    "the advantage is that when a nonbacktracking frog moves away from the root , it will forever remain in the just - entered subtree .",
    "this gives the model more self - similarity .",
    "as shown in @xcite , proposition  7 , @xmath90 can be coupled with a simple random walk on @xmath6 starting from @xmath88 so that its path is a subset of the simple random walk s path .",
    "this lets us relate the nonbacktracking and usual frog models , proving ( [ eqdominance ] ) .",

    "it suffices to show that we can couple the two models so that at least as many frogs visit the root in the usual model as in the nonbacktracking model .",
    "we construct the coupling as follows . for each vertex @xmath92 , make the number of sleeping frogs on @xmath93 identical in the two models .",
    "make each frog s path in the nonbacktracking model a subset of the corresponding frog s path in the usual model as previously described .",

    "we record an observation : suppose the initial frog in the nonbacktracking model steps from the root  @xmath46 to a child  @xmath42 .",
