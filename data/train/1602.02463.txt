    "theoretical investigation of electromagnetic @xmath1 pair production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions goes back to the paper @xcite where the born cross section of the process at high energy was calculated in the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "racah , in his remarkable paper @xcite , has calculated the high - energy asymptotics of the born cross section up to power - suppressed terms in @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is a lorentz factor of the colliding nuclei ) .",
    "recently there was a certain rise of the interest to this process connected with the functioning of heavy ion colliders , like rhic and lhc , see ref .",
    "in particular , a great attention has been paid to the investigation of the coulomb corrections to the cross section at high energies @xcite .",
    "speaking of the total born cross section , the problem of its calculation is of a three - loop complexity level .",
    "probably , this is the main reason why this quantity was not calculated exactly at arbitrary velocities of the colliding nuclei .",
    "this is in contrast to the born cross section of pair photoproduction in the field of an ion , where the total born cross section is known exactly for any energy of the initial photon since refs .",
    "now that we have an essential progress in the multiloop calculations , we are in position to fill this gap and to calculate the total born cross section of @xmath1 pair production in relativistic ion collisions .",
    "the consideration of the present paper is based on the following approach . using the optical theorem we express the total cross section via the sum of cut three - loop integrals .",
    "then we apply the standard approach to multiloop calculations , based on the ibp reduction and differential equations for master integrals .",
    "the differential equations for the master integrals are first reduced to @xmath4-form @xcite using the algorithm of ref .",
    "@xcite , and then solved recursively up to the required order in @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we obtain the total born cross section exactly in the relative velocity @xmath5 of the colliding nuclei .",
    "our result perfectly agrees with the celebrated result of racah @xcite in the limit of large relativistic factor . at small @xmath5",
    "we compare our result with estimate obtained in the recent paper @xcite and find a complete disagreement . in order to find the origin of the disagreement",
    ", we perform a straightforward calculation of the low - energy asymptotics of the cross section differential with respect to the electron and positron momenta .",
    "the direct integration then reproduces our result obtained with the help of the differential equations .",
    "using optical theorem , the total cross section of the process @xmath7 can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is given by the sum of two cut diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut_diagrams ] , @xmath5 is the relative velocity of the colliding nuclei , and @xmath10^{-\\frac12}$ ] is the lorentz factor .",
    "pair production in the collisions of relativistic nuclei .",
    "cut thin line denotes the cut propagator @xmath11 of the electron , cut double line denotes the cut propagator @xmath12 of a heavy particle , interaction vertex with the heavy particle is @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is a four - velocity of the heavy particle ) . ]    contribution of both diagrams can be expresses in terms of the scalar integrals @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the four - velocities of the nuclei , so that @xmath18 .",
    "we proceed in the following way .",
    "first , we perform the ibp reduction of the cut integrals from the above topologies in @xmath19 . for this step",
    "we use ` litered ` , refs .",
    "we end up with 8 master integrals @xmath20    introducing the column - vector @xmath21 , we obtain the differential system @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a matrix with entries being rational functions of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 . passing to new variable , @xmath24",
    ", we apply the algorithm from ref .",
    "@xcite to reduce the differential system to @xmath4-form @xcite .",

    "we use the method of expansion by regions @xcite .",
    "the only nontrivial boundary conditions come from @xmath30 term in small-@xmath5 asymptotics of @xmath31 and @xmath32 : @xmath33 as a result , the @xmath4-expansions of both @xmath34 and @xmath35 is expressed in terms of hpls .",
    "the expansions of @xmath35 are presented in ancillary file . plugging the obtained expansions in the cross section expressed via @xmath34 we observe the cancellation of the terms @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 term gives us the result @xmath39 @xmath40      given the expression , it is easy to calculate both high - energy and low - energy asymptotics of the total cross section .",
    "for @xmath41 we have @xmath42 + \\ldots\\bigg\\}\\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 .",
    "the first line of eq .",
    "is the celebrated racah s result @xcite , and the second line is the first correction to it .",
    "it is interesting to note that the correction is amplified by the fourth power of @xmath44 .    for @xmath45",
    "there is a strong compensation between separate terms in eq . , which leads to @xmath46 suppression of the cross section .",
    "we have @xmath47 recently , the small-@xmath5 asymptotics of the total cross section was discussed in ref .",
    "the estimate @xmath48 given there is in clear contradiction with our result .",
    "in fact , the estimate @xmath49 can be justified in the following way . using the kinematic constraints @xmath50 for momentum transfers @xmath51 ,",
    "it is easy to understand that the main contribution to the cross section is given by the region where @xmath52 the characteristic momenta of the produced particles are of the order of their mass . using these estimates",
    ", it is easy to count powers of @xmath5 in the total cross section .",
    "we have @xmath53 from @xmath54 , @xmath55 from the photon propagators , @xmath56 from the denominator of electron propagator , and @xmath57 from the flux of the colliding particles . as to the numerator of the electron propagator",
    ", one might check that it does not give @xmath57 factor in the sum of two diagrams due to the estimate @xmath58 .    using these estimates",
    ", we have derived the differential cross section at @xmath59 and then obtained the leading term of by the direct integration .",
    "to avoid cluttering , we refrain from presenting fully differential cross section here .",
    "we only present the cross section , differential with respect to the energies of the produced particles : @xmath60\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath61 and @xmath59 is the relative velocity of the nuclei . integrating this cross section over @xmath62 , we obtain the leading term of eq . .",
    "it is interesting to compare our result with the leading high - energy ( racah ) and low - energy asymptotics @xmath63 .",
    "these asymptotics are given by the first line of eq . and the leading term of eq .",
    ", respectively .",
    "[ fig : cross_section ] demonstrates this comparison .",
    "one can see that both low- and high - energy asymptotics essentially depart from the exact result in the region @xmath64 .",
    ", eq . , in units of @xmath66 as a function of @xmath67 ( solid curve )",
    ". dashed and dotted curves correspond to high- and low - energy asymptotics , respectively . right : relative error @xmath68 of the high- and low - energy asymptotics . ]",
    "our approach based on the ibp reduction and calculation of the master integrals allows us , without additional efforts , to calculate the total born cross section of the production of a pair of point - like scalar charged particles .",
    "we have @xmath69 the high- and the low - energy asymptotics of this cross section have the form @xmath70 the leading term @xmath71 in the high - energy asymptotics agrees with the result obtained within the equivalent photon approximation .",
    "curiously , the low - energy asymptotics of the cross section for scalar particles scales differently ( @xmath72 ) than that for spinor particles .",
    "inspection of the contributions of separate diagrams shows that in this limit only the contribution of seagull diagram survive .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the applicability region of our results .",
    "of course , by using the born approximation we assume that @xmath73 . in principle , at small @xmath5 one may expect higher - order corrections of the relative order @xmath74 .",
    "however , since at small @xmath5 the velocities of the produced particles are not small ( see , e.g. , their spectrum ) , we would guess that such corrections are forbidden .",
    "one may also expect corrections of the order @xmath75 due to additional coulomb exchanges between the nuclei , but they seem to be accompanied by the factor @xmath76 , where @xmath77 are the masses of the nuclei . in fact a stronger condition @xmath78 is definitely required because otherwise the limit @xmath79 is no longer valid .",
    "nevertheless , we must admit that the determination of the correct magnitude of the higher - order effects at small @xmath5 requires a separate examination .",
