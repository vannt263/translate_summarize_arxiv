    "deep imaging surveys , such as the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have been extensively analyzed to study galaxy properties out to the reionization epoch .",
    "the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) is measured for samples of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and used to detect cosmic evolution .",
    "the consensus that has developed is that a considerable increase in the space - density of galaxies at the bright end of the lf occurs from redshift @xmath0 @xcite . ] to @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there are still some discrepancies in the interpretation of this evolution , in terms of density , slope , luminosity , or a combination of these .",
    "@xcite undertake a photometric analysis of the hudf @xmath9-dropouts and propose that the density increases six - fold from @xmath0 to @xmath8 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "@xcite push the detection limit deeper to magnitude 30 , finding a steeper faint slope at @xmath0 compared to @xmath8 by 0.2 - 0.3 . furthermore , @xcite estimate corrections to the measured quantities to account for various observational effects and conclude that the intrinsic luminosity is @xmath100.8 mag fainter at @xmath0 .",
    "their conclusions remain qualitatively unchanged after @xcite recently revisit the lf parameters at @xmath8 . on the other hand , ground - based observations , e.g. , @xcite , find an even stronger luminosity evolution .",
    "different measurements of the luminosity density ( ld ) or star formation rate ( sfr ) also give somewhat different results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to establish whether these observed differences are due to intrinsic differences in the evolution of different galaxy populations or due to issues with the derivation of the lf .",
    "spectroscopic confirmations of @xmath0 galaxies , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , have already proven the effectiveness and robustness of the dropout technique in selecting lbgs . however , the faint lbgs , which are essential to determining the faint - end slope of the lf , have not been spectroscopically confirmed because they require impractically long exposure time on large telescopes .",
    "therefore , to improve upon the previous studies of the @xmath0 lf and to establish its form , a number of difficult issues should be considered .",
    "( a ) optimal use of the data : a single field provides us with only a handful of candidates so that some magnitude intervals contain only very few objects .",
    "thus , it is very important to keep all the information . in order to do so , we use un - binned data .",
    "( b ) completeness of the catalogs : the correction to the number of objects observed at faint magnitudes is significant due to the detection incompleteness .",
    "we adopt a more moderate magnitude limit than other groups in order to avoid possible uncertainties brought by large corrections .",
    "( c ) photometric errors and biases : a strict color cut used for @xmath9-dropout selection may lose real lbgs and is affected by contaminants . for each galaxy within or outside the selection window , we explicitly consider its probability of being an actual lbg by assuming a gaussian distribution for the photometric error .    on the basis of the hudf images (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , the udf05 images ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) , and the hudf09 images @xcite , we are now in the position to study properties of lbgs from @xmath11 to beyond @xmath12 utilizing _ hubble space telescope _",
    "s ( _ hst _ ) unparalleled deep optical and infrared ( ir ) view . in this paper",
    ", we plan to further develop techniques to derive the lf at @xmath0 using the procedures used for @xmath7 galaxies in paper ii .",
    "in particular , we apply the maximum likelihood ( ml ) method , which is independent of clustering in our sample , to derive the lf and examine whether star forming galaxies , especially the faint ones , are responsible for re - ionizing or keeping the universe ionized at @xmath0 .",
    "we adopt @xmath13cdm cosmology : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 .",
    "magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "we work on five _ hst_/acs deep fields in four broad bands : f435w ( @xmath18 ) , f606w ( @xmath19 ) , f775w ( @xmath9 ) , and f850lp ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we use the most recent and updated version of the data , namely : goods south ( goods - s ) & goods north ( goods - n ) v2.0 data by @xcite , the hudf data from paper i , hudf nicp12 from paper ii , and hudf nicp34 processed in this work .",
    "pyraf tasks multidrizzle and tweakshifts @xcite help precisely align the images , and sextractor @xcite is run in double - image mode with @xmath20  as the detection band to generate the catalogs .",
    "our survey covers @xmath10 350 arcmin@xmath21 to a magnitude limit of @xmath22 , identifying @xmath10 1100 lbg candidates at @xmath0 , with an average number of  350 per realization , as shown in table [ tab : dropas ] .",
    "we have not made use of the wfc3/ir data that are becoming available on these fields for two main reasons : ( a ) the ir data are not available over the full fields , especially only a small portion of the goods has been covered .",
    "this would force us to reduce the sample size greatly .",
    "( b ) we think an important component of this work is a comparison with other published results which are based on the simple one color selection rather than a full two - color selection .",
    "we do make a quick check of the ir information in the hudf in section [ sec : s ] and will leave a full investigation for future work .",
    "we also do not use ground based data for two main reasons : ( a ) the two goods fields are already large enough to provide good constraints on galaxies brighter than the knee of the schechter function .",
    "( b ) we prefer to work with a homogenous data set in terms of filters and detector qe curves .",
    "the completeness function @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the apparent / detected magnitude ) and the selection function @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the redshift ) are measured by performing recovery simulations in the same way as in paper ii , i.e. , by inserting artificial galaxies into our science images and rerunning sextractor with the same setup as for the original catalog generation .",
    "we use a @xmath27distribution @xmath28 @xcite and a size distribution following a scaling of @xmath29 as in @xcite . for each redshift bin @xmath30 , we thus compute the color a galaxy would have with the randomly chosen @xmath27value and insert it in the images . the input magnitudes are following a flat distribution from @xmath31 , but the selection function is given at observed magnitudes , simply by computing the fraction of galaxies that we insert with the measured output magnitude which is selected by the @xmath9-dropout criteria .",
    "@xmath32 is defined as the probability that a galaxy of @xmath24 in the images is selected in the catalog , which depends strongly on sextractor parameters such as deblend .",
    "thus , it is important that the recovery simulations are done using the same sextractor parameters used to derive the catalog .",
    "@xmath33 represents the probability that a lbg at a given redshift @xmath26 and at a given observed magnitude @xmath24 satisfies the selection criteria . naturally , the product of these two functions @xmath34 is the probability that a galaxy at redshift @xmath26 is detected with magnitude @xmath24 and selected as a lbg .",
    "the uv lf can be expressed in schechter form as , @xmath35\\ ] ] with the absolute magnitude @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the distance modulus and @xmath38 is the k - correction from observed @xmath20  to rest - frame 1400  .",
    "binned data were initially utilized by many groups to derive the shape of the lf .",
    "the observed number of lbgs within the apparent magnitude bin @xmath39 is predicted as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the comoving volume element of the survey .",
    "binning may lose information , and lead to biased results dependent on the bin size . at the same time , having very few luminous candidates in current high - z surveys , there is uncertainty about the numbers in the bright bins since the candidates could jump into adjacent bins due to photometric errors .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that binning is likely to affect the confidence regions for the best - fitting parameters .    to overcome these drawbacks , in this section we present an improved approach based on the ml method ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* sty ) to make optimal use of every possible lbg in the fields .",
    "as also pointed out by @xcite , the sty ml estimator relies essentially on un - binned data .",
    "we determine the shape of the lf by exploring every single detected dropout .",
    "first , we find the probability for each galaxy that it could be selected as a lbg , considering the photometric uncertainty of the catalogs ( section [ sec : f ] ) .",
    "second , we choose galaxies randomly by the above probability and run our ml process ( section [ sec : v ] ) .",
    "third , we repeat the above step enough times to achieve convergence .",
    "we adopt the @xmath9-dropout selection criteria from paper i , i.e. , @xmath42 the dominant criterion , i.e. , the sextractor mag_iso color @xmath43@xmath44 , will be further discussed in section [ sec : f ] .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath45 is demanded for each candidate to largely avoid interlopers ( later this subsection ) or slope steepening ( appendix ) , and to be consistent in comparing with @xmath46 results from @xcite and with @xmath47 results in paper ii .",
    "the photometric errors also take into account the correlated errors present in the images as discussed in paper ii . in addition , we require for class_star @xmath48 if the mag_auto magnitude @xmath20@xmath49 for the hudf , @xmath50 for the udf05 , and @xmath51 for the goods in order to remove stellar contamination at the bright end ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and paper ii ) .",
    "only galaxies with @xmath52 have been included to avoid large uncertainty corrections ( table [ tab : c ] ) .",
    "the selection has been proven to be very efficient and effective .",
    "all the spectroscopically confirmed @xmath43@xmath44 @xmath0 lbgs through the hudf / goods follow - up surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) satisfy our criteria , with only one exception , and no galactic star could pass the class_star test .",
    "we have estimated the possible fraction of interlopers by applying our selection criteria of equations ( 3)-(5 ) to a library of @xmath103000 synthetic seds built on bruzual - charlot models @xcite , adopting the lf derived by @xcite at @xmath8 and no evolution .",
    "the models include the effects of intergalactic absorption @xcite , and span a wide range of metallicities ( 0.04 - 2.5 @xmath53 ) , dust reddening ( no extinction , or eight values logarithmically spaced between @xmath54 and 6.4 ) , emission lines ( no lines or lines computed from first principles from uv sed for hydrogen and fit to cloudy models for metal lines ) , and different star formation histories ( burst , constant at fixed metallicity , constant at evolving metallicity without infall or with infall , two component models with an old component and a young one which may include emission lines ) .",
    "we consider 18 ages logarithmically spaced between 1 myrs and 18 gyrs . and no model older than the universe is included .",
    "we can see from the resulting redshift distribution ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) that there is a lower redshift population @xmath55 of galaxies that may be selected as lbgs at @xmath0 due to the aliasing between the lyman break and the 4000  break ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for more discussions ) . in fig .",
    "[ f22 ] , we have identified our @xmath43@xmath44 candidates detected by the wfc3 f105w ( y@xmath56 ) band in the hudf to verify that our sample does not have many interlopers .",
    "photometric scatter introduces large uncertainties in numbers and magnitudes of the lbg candidates , and therefore , in determined properties of the lf .",
    "if a strict color cut such as @xmath43@xmath44 was applied , the impact of photometric errors would not be fully explored , and many real lbgs with a little bluer measured color may be missed due to photometric errors .",
    "a relaxed cut , e.g. , @xmath43@xmath58 , on the other hand , suffers from larger contaminations .",
    "for example , @xcite found five objects at intermediate redshifts and four intrinsic @xmath0 galaxies within @xmath59@xmath43@xmath60 , which means the contamination rate in the relaxed color window may be as high as @xmath61 .    to account for this effect ,",
    "we calculate the probability that each object is an lbg , which decides how often it could contribute to the later ml process . if @xmath62 is the probability that a galaxy is of magnitude @xmath24 in the catalog , then the @xmath57-factor of @xmath43@xmath44 lbg candidates is defined as : @xmath63 where the integration of @xmath9  is taken over @xmath43@xmath44 .",
    "the real magnitude @xmath24 is assumed to be a gaussian distribution around its cataloged magnitude @xmath64 ( see appendix for details ) . in practice , one could find the values of @xmath57-factor with a monte carlo method by simply generating gaussian distributed magnitudes repeatedly to see how often the @xmath43@xmath44 color would be satisfied .",
    "a 2-@xmath65 magnitude limit is adopted if there is no detection in the @xmath9-band .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath66 when the cataloged @xmath43@xmath44 while @xmath67 when the cataloged @xmath43@xmath60 , and @xmath68 corresponds to the cataloged @xmath43  @xmath10 0.9 when the @xmath20  and @xmath9  errors are both 0.2 .",
    "all @xmath69 galaxies are used in the subsequent ml analysis , i.e. , 1% chance of being included in one realization . table [ tab : dropas ] shows that essentially about 25% - 50% candidates in each field will participate in one realization , which brings our sample in agreement with other groups within the magnitude window in study , such as @xcite .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] and table [ tab : udf ] . )      due to the unique long tail of the acs @xmath20-filter , the k - correction can be as large as 2.2 mag at @xmath70 and goes down to 0.3 mag at @xmath71 .",
    "thus , with distance modulus varying by 0.5 mag there could be a 2.4-mag scatter in uv rest frame absolute magnitudes in realizations at @xmath72 for any given observed @xmath20-magnitude . in other words ,",
    "the relation between @xmath73 and @xmath24 is very uncertain .",
    "therefore , applicable at where @xmath73 is relatively insensitive to redshift or the redshift span is relatively small , the effective volume @xmath74 technique does not fit in our case .",
    "this forces us to seek a new formalism .",
    "we define the apparent lf as @xmath75 and it does not need to be of schechter form . the v - matrix is therefore , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we maximize the likelihood function @xmath78 where @xmath79 the integrations are always taken over the region of interest , for example for the hudf , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "( the bright limit is introduced for calculations only when there is no candidate detected beyond this magnitude , and an even brighter limit will not affect the results since the lf is greatly suppressed at this end . )",
    "@xmath23 has been included in the calculation of @xmath82 so that there is no additional completeness correction factor in @xmath83 .",
    "when combining different fields , e.g. , the goods and the hudf , no additional rescaling factor is needed in the ml method @xcite .",
    "the inputs to the ml process are the v - matrix and the magnitudes @xmath24 of selected candidates . in each realization , candidates are selected from the pool in a probability as to their @xmath57-factor .",
    "the outputs are @xmath84 and @xmath85 in as many as possible realizations , when the averages and errors have been convergent .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath24 considered in the ml process only yields minor errors when several hundreds of galaxies are surveyed ( appendix ) .",
    "@xmath86 is determined by @xmath87 fit to the observed lbg densities with respect to the 1-@xmath65 2-parameter contour of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the lf parameters we derive for @xmath0 are : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath3 mpc@xmath4 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "we notice our faint end slope @xmath85 is slightly steeper than that from some other studies .",
    "this could partly be caused by a steeper slope at @xmath90 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since we include up to @xmath91 lbgs in our estimate of the @xmath0 lf .",
    "since we are investigating a relatively large redshift range @xmath80 and finding indication of lf evolution , it is a good sanity check for us to explicitly consider the effect of evolving lf parameters .",
    "assuming @xmath84 and @xmath85 are uniform in this redshift range , we assign a linear evolution @xmath92 $ ] and repeat the analysis described in section [ sec : s ] - [ sec : v ] .",
    "we find that @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "the closeness to our derived parameters for no evolution , i.e. , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , shows that our results are robust with respect to an evolution of the lf normalization within the redshift range of @xmath9-dropouts .",
    "similar considerations to those in the previous subsection lead us to explore a variation of @xmath84 within the @xmath9-dropout   redshift window .",
    "we do so by assigning @xmath95 $ ] @xcite while keeping uniform values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we find @xmath96 , which is also within one sigma of our non - evolving derivation .",
    "we have verified the internal consistency and robustness of our results and we are now ready to compare them to other studies .      to deal with the weighted average of results from different groups , we follow @xcite .",

    "@xcite puts almost no weight on those measurements without errors where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is widely spread .",
    "instead , we assume a moderate error of 0.3 for those six groups , i.e. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and paper i. combined with the other four measurements providing errors , i.e. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and this work , we find there is about a 95% chance that @xmath5 and @xmath6 , assuming all the current studies are independent and correct .",
    "( see table [ tab : six ] and fig .",
    "[ f4 ] . )      in order to further test the method used here , we derive the faint end slope of the @xmath7 lbg lf using the same catalogs and the same selection criteria as those in paper ii .",
    "to study the hudf and nicp12 data that lack enough bright candidates to determine @xmath84 , we fix @xmath106 to find @xmath107 , which is in agreement with the previous results ( their table 3 ) .",
    "thus , our method , designed to deal with the varying k - correction in @xmath20  and to account for additional uncertainties , is equivalent to our previous method in the simpler @xmath19-dropout case .",
    "the luminosity density ( ld ) at redshift @xmath26 equals @xmath109 , where @xmath110 .",

    "there are fewer recombinations in the diffuse medium and therefore the required flux density to keep the universe ionized increases with increasing redshift .",
    "if the universe has finished reionizing at @xmath0 , then it will be kept ionized at @xmath7 since the required ld at @xmath7 is less than that at @xmath0 and the observed ones are close to each other .",
    "in this paper , we have reported the results of a study of a large sample of faint lbgs in the redshift interval @xmath80 .",
    "working on the five deepest _ hst _ fields with their most updated data , we account for the effect of photometric errors by introducing the factor f as the probability of each galaxy to be an lbg .",
    "we employ un - binned data to keep all the information and to avoid bias , and we develop a modified ml process to reduce the effect of the uncertain relation between m and m. our best - fitting schechter function parameters of the rest - frame 1400  lf at redshift @xmath0 are : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath3 mpc@xmath4 , which suggest evolution of @xmath84 , possible steepening of @xmath85 , and no change of @xmath86 compared to their values at @xmath8 .",
    "such a steep slope suggests that galaxies , especially the faint ones , are possibly the main sources of ionizing photons in the universe at redshift six @xcite . combining ten previous studies at @xmath0 with the extended press method",
    ", we find that the most probable lf favors @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the 95% confidence level . the ld has been found not to evolve significantly between @xmath0 and @xmath7 , but considerable change is detected from @xmath0 to @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath85 remains constant from @xmath0 to @xmath8 as stated by e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , it will be difficult to tell the intrinsically evolving parameter , @xmath84 or @xmath86 , from faint lbgs only , while too few bright lbgs are found due to the limited area of current deep surveys .",
    "ground - based surveys such as the subaru deep field @xcite are extremely efficient in detecting bright lbgs in a large field of view and might clarify whether @xmath84 or @xmath86 alone is not responsible for the change of lf , while splitting the @xmath20-band into two separate bands may be useful to isolate the effect of a possible slope steepening @xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present a derivation of the rest - frame 1400  luminosity function ( lf ) at redshift six from a new application of the maximum likelihood method by exploring the five deepest _ hst_/acs fields , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , the hudf , two udf05 fields , and two goods fields . </S>",
    "<S> we work on the latest improved data products , which makes our results more robust than those of previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> we use un - binned data and thereby make optimal use of the information contained in the dataset . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the analysis to a magnitude limit where the completeness is larger than 50% to avoid possibly large errors in the faint end slope that are difficult to quantify . </S>",
    "<S> we also take into account scattering in and out of the dropout sample due to photometric errors by defining for each object a probability that it belongs to the dropout sample . </S>",
    "<S> we find the best fit schechter parameters to the @xmath0 lf are : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mpc@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> such a steep slope suggests that galaxies , especially the faint ones , are possibly the main sources of ionizing photons in the universe at redshift six . </S>",
    "<S> we also combine results from all studies at @xmath0 to reach an agreement in 95% confidence level that @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the luminosity density has been found not to evolve significantly between @xmath0 and @xmath7 , but considerable evolution is detected from @xmath0 to @xmath8 . </S>"
