    "it has been a longstanding challenge to predict accurately the equation of state and in particular the phase diagrams of fluids and fluid mixtures from atomistic models via computer simulation.@xcite such applications have required a widespread development of computer simulation methodology : significant advances were possible through the invention of gibbs ensemble @xcite and configurational bias @xcite methodologies , grand canonical monte carlo simulations combined with histogram reweighting methods @xcite and finite size scaling @xcite including field mixing , @xcite umbrella sampling @xcite and other expanded ensemble methods.@xcite a lot of effort has also been spent towards developing more and more accurate effective potentials from quantum chemistry methods ( e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "however , for simple and industrially relevant fluids such as carbon dioxide @xcite it is still difficult to predict the equation of state with high accuracy , such that experimental data in the critical region and for temperatures @xmath1 around it are reproduced to an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "@xcite extending such calculations to mixtures ( in particular , solutions of polymers with supercritical carbon dioxide as a solvent ) is even more of a problem , due to the less complete knowledge of effective potentials , and due to the extensive numerical effort required .",
    "a three - dimensional parameter space involving the variables temperature @xmath2 , pressure @xmath3 and mole fraction @xmath4 needs to be scanned for a binary system , and the phase diagrams are typically very complicated , because vapor - liquid and fluid - fluid phase equilibria compete with each other.@xcite if polymers are chosen as a solute , their molecular weight enters as an additional fourth variable .",
    "moreover , the coarse - grained representation of the solvent ( e.g.  carbon dioxide ) and the solute have to be compatible , i.e. , one can not combine an atomistic description of the solvent with a much coarser representation of a macromolecular solute . there is clearly a need to devise models that are simple enough to allow extensive simulation studies with an affordable effort and nevertheless accurate enough to be interesting for applications to experiment and in the context of industrial processing .",
    "such validated coarse - grained models that accurately reproduce thermodynamic bulk properties are also a starting point for investigating the kinetics of phase separation or spatially inhomogeneous systems ( e.g.  wetting and catalysis ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we wish to make a step towards this goal , extending our previous study of a selected sample of simple pure fluids , in particular carbon dioxide @xcite to various binary mixtures .",
    "we want to stress that our aim is not to reach the most accurate prediction of the phase diagram of a specific system .",
    "indeed , motivated by the excellent results obtained for the pure carbon dioxide and for simple quadrupolar molecules in general , @xcite we want to investigate how this model performs for mixtures , especially solutions of various alkanes .",
    "in particular we will show that the new coarse grained ( cg ) model avoids the need for a big violation of the lorentz - berthelot ( lb ) combining rules ( that was required in previous work @xcite ) .",
    "this violation destroys the predictivity of the model because extensive experimental data for the mixture would be required to determine a parameter describing the violation of the lb combining rule . due to the generality of the approach and the level of accuracy for the pure components ,",
    "the present investigation is relevant both for practical purposes and for a general understanding of coarse graining procedures .",
    "@xcite we will also present results of an analytical equation of state ( eos ) which ( apart from some region of the phase diagram near critical points ) is able to yield rather satisfactory predictions in agreement with monte carlo results .",
    "it is very important to note that this eos uses the same model parameters as the monte carlo simulation .",
    "this implies that in principle we are in a position to attempt to predict the phase diagram of a binary mixture ( which is very complex @xcite ) with comparatively small computational effort . in this view",
    "the reader should also interpret our choice to use lb combining rules : of course there are no reasons to believe that such approximations should be exact , and certainly there will be cases where more complicated combining rules are preferable .",
    "however , the simple lb combining rules used here suffice for a wide class of systems with quite acceptable errors .",
    "due to the generality of the scheme presented in this work we expect discrepancies , and some regions of the phase diagram might not be predicted properly .",
    "this is related to several limitations of the present procedure like _ i _ ) the large @xmath2 expansion involved in the building of the cg model for quadrupolar solvents @xcite and _ ii _ ) limitations related to our simple modeling approach like the simple potentials involved ( lennard - jones ) , the neglect of atomistic details , and the use of the lb combining rules for which discrepancies are known to arise ( see e.g.   for some systems also investigated in this work ) . in order to disentangle point _ i _ ) from point _ ii _ )",
    "we also present investigations of similar apolar mixtures for which the new cg model @xcite does not result in any improvement .",
    "the results show similar discrepancies from experiment as the polar phase diagrams , confirming the quality of the choice in refs .  .",
    "we want to stress that in order to test the goodness of our cg model , the only reliable method is a monte carlo investigation .",
    "indeed , without mc simulation it is impossible to distinguish the bias related to the approximations involved in the eos from the bias involved in the cg model [ point _ ii _ ) above ] .",
    "for instance , we will present results for the mixture of methane and carbon dioxide for which eos results will be in better agreement with experiments than mc results : this is clearly a fortuitous cancellation !    it is important to report that other interesting and significant attempts to build a systematic description of mixture phase diagrams are present in the literature .",
    "for instance in mixtures are treated with models previously investigated in .",
    "for some of the molecules studied , these models allow for an additional parameter that can be adjusted and consequently a more accurate fit of experimental data is possible . on the other hand , there is a loss in predictivity because the full phase diagrams of the pure substances are required in order to determine the simulation parameters ( computed in a @xmath5 square fit which minimizes discrepancies with experiment@xcite ) plus mixture data @xcite to determine the mixing parameters .",
    "so the strategy of the present work is to deal with relatively simple models , where ( in the framework of monte carlo simulations ) the statistical mechanics can be dealt with at a very good level of accuracy ( e.g.  long runs employing advanced monte carlo techniques are possible to minimise statistical errors and systematic errors due to finite size effects which are avoided by finite size scaling analysis ) .",
    "these models are suitable for analytic eos models as well , and can serve as a starting point for the coarse grained modeling of polymer solutions .",
    "of course , we do not imply that a complementary simulation strategy ( making models as detailed as possible , to account for the packing of molecules in the liquid as accurately as possible , including polarizability , etc . )",
    "is not worth pursuing in its own right , but it is outside of the scope of the present work .",
    "it is well established @xcite that the most reliable approach to study the phase behavior of fluids is based on grand canonical monte carlo simulations together with histogram reweighting and finite size scaling techniques , especially if one wishes to include the critical region . in this study , we follow this approach , and amend it by successive umbrella sampling @xcite to obtain coexistence curves far from criticality .",
    "this method has the additional advantage that the interfacial free energy between the coexisting phases can be extracted as well.@xcite as we are interested in a very fast simulation code , we omit any potentials including effective charges , and restrict our attention to short range effective potentials .",
    "three - body ( nonbonded ) forces are avoided as well .",
    "electrostatic quadrupole - quadrupole interactions are treated as a perturbation ( which is practically justifiable @xcite ) , such that an effective angular - independent ( but temperature - dependent @xcite ) interaction decaying proportionally to the power @xmath6 of the interparticle distance @xmath7 results .",
    "the dispersion forces are modeled by lennard - jones ( lj ) potentials . for the sake of computational efficiency",
    ", all potentials are cut at the distance @xmath8 and shifted to zero at r@xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the range parameter of the lj potential ) .",
    "when we deal with alkane chains , we disregard any torsional forces and bond - angle potentials and integrate a few successive chemical monomers into one effective monomeric unit ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is done in the way that one such unit contains three carbon - carbon bonds between successive carbon atoms , and we do not distinguish between interior ch@xmath0 monomers and the ch@xmath11 groups at the chain ends .",
    "thus , for example , hexadecane ( c@xmath12h@xmath13 ) is represented by a chain molecule containing five effective monomers ( see fig .  [ fig1]).@xcite the procedure of coarsening three carbon atoms in a bead has been proven to be optimal in several theoretical investigations @xcite ( see sec .",
    "we stress that the particular choice of coarsening three carbon units into one bead has nothing to do with the physical lengths of the chain ( like for instance the kuhn length ) , but is a choice that depends more on the potentials used . indeed as neighboring beads along a chain",
    "interact with a bonding potential ( see sec .",
    "iiic for definitions ) in addition to the lennard jones potential , the coarse grained model of the chain exhibits a degree of local stiffness , although neither bond angle or torsional potentials are included explicitely .",
    "this implies that the kuhn length is longer than the diameter of our beads .",
    "of course , the suitable choice of parameters is crucial for such coarse - grained models : we choose the strength of the quadrupole moment @xmath14 ( if there is one ) such that it is compatible with experimental data , and adjust the range @xmath15 and strength @xmath16 of the lj potential such that the experimental critical density @xmath17 and critical temperature @xmath18 are reproduced precisely in the simulation . in sec .",
    "iii , we will briefly discuss the accuracy of this procedure for a variety of pure systems ( noble gases , co@xmath0 , ch@xmath19 , c@xmath20h@xmath20 , short alkanes ) while sec .",
    "iv contains the central part of our work , in which we present a variety of results for binary mixtures .",
    "the additional interactions needed for the mixtures are chosen by the simple lorentz - berthelot combining rules.@xcite    technical aspects of our simulations are similar to previous studies.@xcite far from the critical point coexistence densities are computed using the successive sampling algorithm of virnau and mller @xcite in which high free energy barriers are overcome constraining the algorithm at a certain time of the simulation to sample configurations of a system where the number of particles is @xmath21 or @xmath22 . varying @xmath21 from @xmath23 to @xmath24 one is able to reconstruct ( after proper reweighting ) the free energy profile @xmath25 at coexistence in the range of densities of interest . at phase coexistence",
    ", we expect a distribution @xmath25 with two peaks ( corresponding to the two coexisting phases that differ in particle number ) which have equal weight . in few",
    "very fast runs ( using a small cubic box @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the biggest lj length parameter of the model ) , invoking the equal weight rule for @xmath25 , we are able to tune the chemical potential(s ) to their coexistence values , with a reasonable error ( @xmath281 - 5% ) which in some cases should be enough .",
    "then , we start a second long simulation for a larger elongated box ( to enhance the formation of the liquid - gas interface ) @xmath29 with @xmath30 in which every window is sampled with 2 - 10@xmath31 mc steps .",
    "every mc step includes : 100 grand canonical moves in which we try to insert / delete solvent ( and chain ) particles , 1 local move in which a number of monomers equal to the total number of monomers are rearranged , and 10@xmath32n@xmath33 reptation moves , where n@xmath33 is the number of the chains in the box .",
    "such a run requires on average 10 h of cpu time on 32 nodes of an ibm power4 cluster .",
    "the precision of the measured coexistence densities ( for instance ) is roughly 1% .",
    "using a spherical averaged potential allows us to speed up computations by a factor @xmath285 @xcite in comparison with the full quadrupolar model .",
    "a number of chains @xmath34 usually allows a complete sampling of the liquid peak , while the number of solvent particles is typically of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we emphasize that unlike simulations in the gibbs - ensemble in addition to the densities and compositions of the coexisting phases and their compressibilities , the simulation technique also provides information about the interface tension . at the critical point",
    ", we use the same kind of simulation described above , but unconstrained .",
    "( at every time the number of particles is free to fluctuate in all the region [ 0,@xmath35 ) . for more detail on the finite size analysis",
    "used we refer the reader to sec .",
    "even with all these simplifying approximations , establishing the phase behavior and thermodynamic properties of binary mixtures comprehensively still requires a lot of work with monte carlo simulations . far away from critical points ,",
    "such an effort is not needed , and one can try to use an analytical equation of state .",
    "we use a previously developed theory based on wertheim thermodynamic perturbation theory ( tpt ) .",
    "we strictly follow ref .  .",
    "in particular the free energy of the system @xmath36 is decomposed in a contribution due to a mixture of unbonded monomers ( the reference system ) plus a contribution due to chain associativity @xmath37 , @xcite @xmath38 .",
    "wertheim s theory allows us to compute @xmath37 perturbatively using quantities of the reference system ( like pair correlation functions ) and the known bonding potential .",
    "we use a first order perturbation theory ( tpt1 ) which ( at this point ) reduces the problem to the computation of pair correlation functions and the free energy ( @xmath39 ) of a binary mixture of non - bonded monomers interacting with lj potentials ( chain - chain monomers and solvent - chain monomers ) and the lj + quadrupolar interaction ( see sec .",
    "iiib ) for solvent - solvent monomers .",
    "@xmath39 is computed using standard perturbation theory : the ornstein - zernike equation is solved using a mean spherical ( msa ) closure.@xcite in particular , one chooses as reference system a mixture of hard spheres with diameters computed using the repulsive part of the monomer - monomer potential in a barker henderson approximation , @xcite while the attractive part of the potential is treated as a perturbation .",
    "a msa solution is then obtained using the analytical implementation of tang and lu , @xcite in which the repulsive part of the lj potential is fitted by a couple of yukawa tails which allow to obtain an analytical result.@xcite in our present modeling approach we need to consider lj potentials plus quadrupolar interactions .",
    "this problem has been solved in ( see app .",
    "a of ) by applying a second pair of yukawa tails to fit the quadrupolar interaction . in our msa scheme",
    "we also use a `` one fluid approximation''.@xcite our results will show how this simple theory is able to reproduce results in rather good agreement with mc data away from the critical point .",
    "on the other hand , big discrepancies occur near the critical points , due to the mean field nature of the msa while experimental results exhibit critical behavior characteristic of the ising universality class .",
    "we are aware of significant efforts to design proper eos which include ising fluctuation near the critical point.@xcite however , such investigations are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "another popular method based on tpt1 is known as `` statistical associating fluid theory '' ( saft ) .",
    "@xcite    we want to stress that monte carlo simulations remain an indispensable tool in investigations of the phase behavior of polymer solutions and mixtures .",
    "indeed , in the present study the model parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath15 and @xmath40 ) have been determined@xcite using the simulation critical points which were obtained by monte carlo simulation in .",
    "( any mean field approximation has difficulties in reproducing the critical line with sufficient accuracy ) .",
    "note that supercritical fluids are interesting and useful for practical applications , mainly due to their high compressibility and the concomitant large variations of density upon small changes of pressure , which are the origin of the breakdown of a mean field approximation like tpt .",
    "this means that in some very interesting regions of the phase diagram monte carlo simulations are indeed a very valuable tool .",
    "when we discuss the extent to which the lorentz - berthelot combining rule can account for the phase behavior of mixtures , we need to distinguish between inaccuracies arising from an imperfect description of the pure components and those arising from the lorentz - berthelot rule . therefore it is necessary to give an overview of our modeling of the pure components at the outset .",
    "note that a possible additional source of errors are entropic packing effects of non - spherical molecules that may show up differently in a mixture of two molecules having different shapes rather than for a pure system , where all molecules have the same shape .",
    "such effects are lost in our coarse - grained models .",
    "however , this latter criticism can not be applied when we consider mixtures of noble gases , since in the framework of classical statistical mechanics the description of noble gas atoms as point particles , where two such atoms interact with a potential depending on the absolute value of their distance only , is certainly appropriate .",
    "( disregarding the case of he , quantum effects are negligible indeed at temperatures of interest @xcite ) .",
    "for that reason , noble gases are also included in our discussion , because they will bring out the possible limitations of our modeling in terms of pair - wise effective potentials between point - like particles most clearly .",
    "thereafter , we shall deal with co@xmath0 , c@xmath20h@xmath20 , ch@xmath19 , and selected short alkanes .",
    "the interaction between neutral point - like particles in our work is always described by the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential ,    @xmath41\\quad .\\ ] ]    rather than working with the full lj potential as written in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we find it computationally more convenient and efficient to cut off this potential at @xmath42 and shift it to zero there , such that    @xmath43    where s = 127/16384 for our choice of @xmath44 , so that the potential is continuous everywhere .",
    "when we require that eqs .",

    "the range @xmath48 of the lj potential is fixed once @xmath49 is known for the model . here ,",

    "( [ eq1 ] , [ eq2 ] ) have been estimated with high precision.@xcite fig .",
    "11 of ref .   compares these phase diagrams with each other and with experimental data for the noble gases ne , ar , kr and xe .",
    "@xcite one can see that in this scaled representation the differences between the phase diagrams based on full and truncated lj models are quite minor .",
    "although noble gases are thought to be the best possible experimental realization of lj fluids , the agreement is not perfect either : while ne and ar are very close to the lj prediction , the data for the fluid branch of kr and xe are somewhat off .",
    "this implies that even noble gases do not strictly satisfy the `` law of corresponding states '' , and hence a description in terms of classical point particles interacting with purely pairwise potentials of the same functional form , @xmath52 , with one parameter for the strength @xmath53 ) and another for the range @xmath48 of the potential can not be strictly true , irrespective of the form of the function @xmath54 : either a more complicated form of the pairwise interaction , involving a third system - specific parameter is needed , or ( what is usually assumed ) some effect of three - body interactions @xcite are present .    an even more pronounced deviation from",
    "the simple lj model shows up , however , when additional quantities are analyzed , such as the vapor pressure @xmath55 at liquid - vapor coexistence and the interfacial tension @xmath56 between the coexisting vapor and liquid phases of the fluid ( see figs .  [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that adjusting @xmath15 from @xmath47 implies that the whole curve for the coexistence pressure @xmath55 in the @xmath57 plane is underestimated for both kr and xe .",
    "this is a serious drawback for the description of binary mixtures , of course , where one wishes to work in the @xmath58 ensemble , @xmath4 being the molar fraction of the solute .",
    "therefore , we have tried an alternative , namely adjusting @xmath15 such that the experimental critical pressure @xmath59 is correctly reproduced . for kr",
    "the critical temperature @xmath60 @xcite implies @xmath61 .",
    "if one uses @xmath62 @xcite to fit @xmath10 one obtains @xmath63 , while using @xmath64 bar @xcite instead would yield @xmath65 .",
    "( for a discussion of the accuracy of our estimation of @xmath16 and @xmath15 , we refer to table i. in order to guarantee the reproducibility of our results we always present @xmath16 and @xmath15 with all the digits that have been used in our programs . ) fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that a somewhat better description of the vapor pressure @xmath55 is obtained over the full temperature regime from @xmath66 .",
    "the deviation from the data for the surface tension @xmath15 has also become smaller ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) , but now there is a strong deviation between the data for the liquid branch of the coexistence curve and the model ( fig .  [ fig3]a ) .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] clearly shows that this model allows for a fairly good description of the mixture phase diagram ( if compared to other mixtures presented in this work ) . in the present context it was not necessary to include more complex potentials available in the literature since long times ( e.g.  ) .",

    "both torsional potentials and bond - angle potentials between effective beads are ignored .",
    "hence , it is worthwhile to test whether such crude models are still able to reproduce the phase diagram and other thermodynamic properties of the real system correctly .",
    "thus , figs .",
    "[ fig7]-[fig9 ] show results for the phase diagrams of several members of the alkane series ( including c@xmath11h@xmath100 , c@xmath101h@xmath102 and c@xmath12h@xmath13 ) in the t-@xmath106 plane , as well as the corresponding coexistence pressures and interfacial tensions between the coexisting vapor and liquid phases .",
    "the agreement between the model results and the corresponding experimental data @xcite is remarkable , again , although it is not as convincing as for methane ( which we have included for comparison ) . in particular , for c@xmath101h@xmath102 deviations clearly occur .",

    "[ fig8 ] shows that the slope of the vapor pressure versus temperature curve is close to the slope derived from experiments , too . for temperatures away from the critical region ( say , 20@xmath107 below @xmath18 ) , deviations between experiment and the model predictions become visible , both in the coexistence curve , coexistence pressure , and interface tension ( fig.[fig9 ] ) , in particular for propane and pentane",
    "of course , the accuracy of the modeling could be enhanced by allowing for additional adjustable parameters like in many models in the literature , e.g.  by introducing a bond - angle potential , or more interaction sites ( see e.g. ) .",
    "then , quantities such as the acentric factor ( referring to the shape of the coexistence curve 30@xmath107 below @xmath18 @xcite ) can presumably be fitted nicely .",
    "however , the simplicity of the coarse - grained model is lost .",
    "experience with such somewhat more complicated models shows that these models still require correction parameters @xmath108 to the lb combining rules that deviate from unity by about 10@xmath107 ( see e.g.  ) . without these additional parameters ( note that it is not at all straightforward to find optimal values for these parameters )",
    "the gain in accuracy that such models yield for the description of mixtures is rather modest .",
    "note that an important motivation for the present work is to develop simple models suitable for the simulation of polymer solutions ( the case of hexadecane in co@xmath0 being just a prototype case ) .",
    "we are not focusing on pushing the accuracy of modeling of pure short alkanes to its limit .",
    "extending our treatment to binary systems ( a , b ) one wishes to describe the interactions between unlike particles by a potential of the same functional form as it is used for the interactions between particles of the same type , i.e. the lennard - jones potential in our case .",
    "the simplest choice , most often used in the literature , is the lorentz - berthelot combining rule @xcite    @xmath109    as is well - known , there is really no convincing derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) , so there is no reason to believe that eq .",

    "we also note that the lorentz - berthelot rule works very well for the prediction of virial coefficients for the mixture of argon plus co@xmath0 , a mixture of an apolar and a quadrupolar fluid .",
    "we want to stress that proceeding in such a way no experimental input from the mixture phase diagram is required for testing a full predictive model for the mixture .",
    "this also holds for the tpt1 computations which require only @xmath16 and @xmath15 that can be obtained using monte carlo results of the pure component critical line.@xcite coexistence densities and pressure have been computed as in pure component systems.@xcite on the other hand , the computation of the critical points is more complicated .",
    "indeed , in a binary mixtures close to criticality the proper identification of the order parameter is a subtle problem . @xcite in principle , complete scaling @xcite in the case of binary mixtures implies that three scaling fields occur , which are linear combinations of four independent intensive variables : the deviations of two chemical potentials , temperature , and pressure from their values at the critical point .",
    "consequently , the order parameter density becomes a function of the appropriate conjugate variable , and the relevant physical densities ( particle number densities , entropy density ) become nonlinear functions of the proper scaling fields.@xcite since this formalism is somewhat cumbersome for the case of compressible binary fluid mixtures , we simplify the problem by applying `` field - mixing''-procedures analogous to the method of wilding @xcite which is rather successful for most one - component fluids .",
    "details on this procedure are reported in the appendix [ appendix ] , presenting the analysis done for a critical point of the krypton xenon mixture . in order to estimate systematic errors of this procedure , in appendix [ appendix ] we also present results with a full finite size analysis with cumulants crossing @xcite for a highly asymmetric mixture like carbon dioxide in hexadecane .      as a first example of apolar mixture we present results for kripton plus xenon . as it has been discussed in sec .",
    "ii , the noble gases already exhibit rather large deviations between the experimental data and the model calculations based on the lennard - jones potential .",

    "ii a. if we fit @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the pure systems , the predicted critical points for the mixture deviate from the experimental curve about as much as for the pure systems . if we adjust @xmath111 such that @xmath112 is reproduced , the data @xcite for the two mixed systems are almost perfectly reproduced .",
    "the variation of the critical concentration with temperature is also rather well reproduced ( fig .",

    "the proper prediction of the phase diagram type is a very stringent test . indeed ,",
    "variation of the interaction parameters by a few percent could drastically change the type of the phase diagram .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the phase diagrams of a variety of fluid binary mixtures , with particular emphasis on mixtures of alkanes in supercritical carbon dioxide and benzene . in order to better understand the performance of our modeling for these systems",
    ", we have also investigated mixtures with apolar solvents including noble gases and methane .",
    "we have investigated the accuracy of the use of the lorentz - berthelot rules for describing the mixing behavior , based on interaction parameters for the pure systems that are tuned such that the critical point ( critical temperature , critical density or pressure ) of the pure systems are well reproduced . using a simple lennard - jones model for interaction parameters of pure apolar fluids ,",
    "monte carlo calculations in the grand - canonical ensemble , analyzed by appropriate finite size scaling methods , readily yield the desired accuracy for this procedure . for the polar molecules we use a spherically averaged point - like quadrupolar interaction , @xcite which",
    "was shown to produce very good phase diagrams , @xcite also if compared to more realistic atomistic models .",
    "our model takes as experimental input the critical temperatures and densities of the pure components ( like in previous coarse grained schemes @xcite ) plus the experimental quadrupolar moments . for pure co@xmath0 and c@xmath20h@xmath20",
    "this choice leads to a significant improvement in comparison with a simple lj model without explicitly accounting for the polar interactions . in ref .   and fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , as a second option , we have treated the quadrupole moment as an effective parameter in an attempt to optimize agreement with experiments .",
    "we tune this parameter such that the liquid branch of the vapor - liquid coexistence curve of pure co@xmath0 or pure c@xmath20h@xmath20 is optimally represented . in the case of benzene , for which the optimization procedure seems to work very well , the agreement with the coexistence pressure is also improved .",
    "( this is not the case of co@xmath0 which is however better described than benezene if the experimental values for the quadrupole moments are used . )",
    "the physical reason for this requirement to work with an effective quadrupole moment is presumably that actual molecules are not point - like particles , of course : co@xmath0 is a rather elongated molecule , while c@xmath20h@xmath20 is disk - like .",
    "so packing effects should occur , i.e.local orientational correlations , which are underestimated by the quadrupolar interaction .",
    "thus , it is gratifying to note that a remarkable improvement of accuracy in the prediction of the phase behavior of mixtures is achieved if this effective quadrupole moment is used .",
    "these energy parameters , which we fixed from the description of the pure systems , together with the lorentz - berthelot rules , allow us to predict phase diagrams of mixtures , with no ambiguity whatsoever , since no further adjustable parameters occur .",
    "two methods of prediction are used : ( i ) monte carlo simulations ( ii ) tpt1-msa calculations .",
    "the monte carlo approach has the substantial advantage that it is also accurate near critical points of the mixture . in principle",
    ", we obtain the exact statistical mechanics of the model system . any discrepancy between experiment and prediction",
    "is entirely due to a shortcoming of the ( simplified ) model .",
    "the tpt1-msa approach has the merit that relatively little computational effort is necessary to implement it .",
    "however , it clearly involves various approximations and hence the interpretation of discrepancies between tpt1-msa and experiment is not so clear - part of them being due to inadequacies of the model , part of them stem from inaccurate approximations .",
    "for instance ,",
    "tpt1-msa , like all mean - field theories , overestimates the critical temperature and pressure , so the isothermal slices through the phase diagram of the mixture always involve two - phase regions which are too large .",
    "we note that fluids like co@xmath0 have an important application as supercritical solvents .",
    "if one aims at describing the behavior in the critical region of the pure solvent and of the mixtures correctly , monte carlo methods have a clear advantage .",
    "now , one could try to readjust parameters in the tpt1-msa approach to improve agreement with experiment ( like done for instance in , where @xmath16 and @xmath15 for the eos have been rescaled in comparison to the model used in mc simulations in order to properly reproduce the critical points of the pure compounds ) , but this would be just an attempt to provide a partial cancellation of errors , and in other regions of the phase diagram the description would necessarily get worse .",
    "@xcite since we feel that relatively little physical insight is gained by such fitting procedures , they have not been implemented in our paper .",
    "our overall conclusion is that in the framework of the modeling as defined above the lorentz - berthelot rules work very well , in the sense that an ad - hoc change of mixed binary interactions by at most a few percent ( typically one or two percent ) would lead to almost perfect agreement with experiment . as a piece of evidence for this claim ,",
    "we note that in the study of the co@xmath0+c@xmath12h@xmath13 system by virnau et al . , @xcite where the co@xmath0 molecule was modeled as a point particle with lj interactions with no account of the quadrupole moment , a correction factor @xmath140 to the lorentz - berthelot rule was required to produce good agreement with experiment . however , the present model ( with a quadrupolar interaction and no correction factor ) yields results that are almost identical to those of virnau et al .",
    "@xcite when @xmath148 is chosen . as a consequence ,",
    "we conclude that in the present model a correction factor @xmath149 would suffice to reproduce the results . noting that the lorentz - berthelot rule assumes that the mixed correlation functions in the fluid described atomistically behave in the same way as in the coarse - grained descriptions , deviations of such a fitting parameter @xmath108 from unity in the range from 1 to 2% are no surprise at all .",
    "thus we feel that the present level of accuracy can not easily be improved in the framework of our model .",
    "as it has been emphasized already in the introduction , many more complicated models for fluids are discussed in the literature ( see ) .",
    "optimizing parameters in those models such that the critical properties of the pure systems and their vapor - liquid coexistence curves are very well reproduced , might be an alternative starting point to test the validity of combining rules .",
    "@xcite however , even for our very simple model the monte carlo runs require substantial computer resources , and hence we have not attempted to generalize our approach to other models .",
    "the strength of our method , if compared to more detailed models with a lot of parameters the optimization of which would require massive computation , is its generality .",
    "it is possible to have the potentials for a given mixture , without any extra computational efforts from the results of the pure components .",
    "@xcite it is also important to mention that the present work validates the use of spherical averaged quadrupolar potential .",
    "@xcite    finally , it is important to observe that our way to coarse grain solvent molecules into single beads has the advantage , with respect to atomistic models like multi center lennard jones , to be accessible to advanced equation of state machineries . in this paper",
    "we have shown how , with rather small efforts , significant results can be obtained .",
    "we are also aware of the fact that several improvements could be done ( e.g.  using some integral equation scheme which should improve the msa solution near the critical point ) . however , most of the advanced methods in equation of state modeling , apply only for reference systems that are mixture of monomers ( i.e.  beads with point - like interactions ) , the associating part being taken into account by tpt1 . on the other hand tpt1 gives a reasonable description only if in the `` associated molecule '' diameters of the beads do not overlap .",
    "this is of course the case in our cg model for alkanes in which the experimental distance between three carbon units ( d=4.59  ) is bigger than the typical @xmath15 used ( @xmath1504  ) .",

    "in this appendix we describe how the critical points for the mixtures ( e.g.  figs .  [ fig4 ] [ fig18 ] ) have been obtained . as mentioned in the sec .",
    "[ secmixture ] in asymmetric binary mixtures the determination of the order parameter is difficult @xcite and a complete scaling @xcite requires a lot of work which has to be repeated for every critical point . for this reason in the present work the method of wilding @xcite has been used .",
    "taking as an example the kripton xenon mixture ( but the same procedure has been done for all the other mixtures ) , we take the order parameter @xmath153 as a linear combination of the particle numbers of kr atoms ( @xmath154 ) and of xe atoms ( @xmath155 ) and of the total potential energy @xmath156 @xmath157 where the parameters @xmath158 are determined by the following iterative procedure .",
    "first , the chemical potential @xmath159 ( in lj units ) is tuned to get vapor - liquid phase coexistence ( i.e. , the distribution @xmath160 satisfies the equal area rule ) .",
    "normally , due to the lacking of the particle  hole symmetry , the two peaks will not be symmetric such as the two peaks of the universal ising model distribution at criticality . thus , as a second step the other chemical potential is also tuned ( and the step 1 is repeated ) , so that one gets somewhat closer to the critical point of the system .",
    "still , the universal shape of the distribution is not yet obtained .",
    "the third step consists in a variation of @xmath161 ( and repeating steps 1 and 2 ) such that the two peaks of the distribution become as similar to each other as possible .",
    "the fourth step amounts to a variation of @xmath162 ( again repeating steps 1 and 2 ) . in this way",
    "( for the investigated cases ) it is possible to obtain a final histogram of the order parameter @xmath153 that reproduces the universal ising shape at criticality almost exactly ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand the previous approach is not totally correct because it neglects finite size corrections for the critical parameters but simply `` supposes '' that the simulation box is large enough . in order to elucidate this point in this appendix",
    "we also report the full finite size analysis @xcite with crossing cumulants for several simulation boxes .",
    "we do this investigation for the polymer solution studied in this paper ( co@xmath0+c@xmath12h@xmath13 ) which should be more sensible to mixing effects being a highly asymmetric mixture in which the coupling between two order parameters ( total density and relative concentration , respectively ) may be more of a problem rather than for some noble gas or small molecule mixtures . in fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] we report our finite size analysis for the critical point at t=486 k. from extensive @xmath163 simulations ( @xmath164 being the chemical potential of the solvent , co@xmath0 in this case , and @xmath165 the chemical potential of the polymer c@xmath12h@xmath13 ) histograms have been generated for the total energy @xmath156 , the number of solvent particles @xmath166 and the number of polymers , @xmath167 .",
    "the probability distribution for the order parameter @xmath168 is computed , using @xmath169 as an initial guess ( it turns out that the final results depend on the parameter @xmath162 so weakly , that one may choose @xmath170 here ; on the other hand the choice @xmath169 was suggested comparing @xmath160 with the universal ising curve , similarly to what has been done above for the krypton - xenon mixture ) .",
    "the simulation box linear dimensions were @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath161 and @xmath164 , @xmath174 is always fixed so that @xmath160 satisfies the equal area rule .",
    "then , we compute second and fourth order cumulants @xmath175 , @xmath176 ( where @xmath177 ) as a function of @xmath164 , for different @xmath178 ( fig .  [ fig19]a ) .",
    "it is seen that rather well - defined intersection points of the curves @xmath179 and @xmath180 vs. @xmath164 for different choices of @xmath178 do in fact occur at @xmath181 . using a simple comparison with the universal critical curve ( which is the method we have used for all the critical lines of fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] ) we previously obtained a value @xmath182 , which is very close to the value determined above ( in particular within the 0.5% which is our general estimate of errorbars ) .",
    "the intersection for @xmath179 occurs close to the theoretical value @xcite @xmath183 , while the intersection point for the curves @xmath180 is somewhat too low .",
    "this may indicate that the choice of the mixing parameter @xmath161 is not optimal .",
    "however , varying @xmath180 as a function of @xmath161 , at fixed choices of @xmath184 we observe that @xmath180 has a shallow minimum near the chosen value @xmath169 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig19]a ) .",
    "this could justify in some sense the apriori chosen value for @xmath161 and gives an estimate of the systematic error related to the choice of @xmath161 , which is very small .",
    "( we notice that variation of @xmath180 with @xmath161 is not strong enough that one could tune the parameters such that the intersection occurs strictly at the theoretical value , and with a distribution function @xmath160 which is far from looking like the ising curve ) .",
    "we conclude that all the sizes from @xmath171 up to @xmath185 are not yet in the asymptotic region of finite size scaling , and so various corrections to finite size scaling occur which could only be disentangled if a much wider range of @xmath178 were at our disposal . in view of such possible systematic errors",
    ", we have allowed an error bar for the critical values of @xmath164 and @xmath174 of 3 parts in a thousand , three times as large as one would conclude from a naive analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig19]a . in any case",
    ", the uncertainties resulting from these finite size analysis are much less than the deviation between our model predictions and the experimental data .",
