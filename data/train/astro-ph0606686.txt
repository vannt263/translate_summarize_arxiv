    "`` fallback '' may occur when the reverse shock , caused by the impact of the shock wave with the outer stellar envelope , reaches the newly formed ns @xcite . depending upon the rotation rate of the massive progenitor , some of the fallback may have sufficient angular momentum to form a disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although widely predicted by contemporary numerical studies of supernovae @xcite , there are few observational constraints on the existence of fallback disks or even of supernova fallback generally .",
    "fallback could have profound implications for the endgame of massive star evolution , particularly since it could lead a newborn ns to collapse into a black hole @xcite .",

    ", there are a few young snrs currently known to contain radio - quiet , non - plerionic x - ray point sources near their geometric center ( see @xcite , hereafter , for a review ) .",
    "these x - ray point sources , often called central compact objects ( ccos ) , have x - ray spectra roughly consistent with the thermal - like surface ( but smaller than the expected neutron star surface ) emission from young cooling nss .",
    "however , they differ from `` typical '' young nss ( e.g. , the crab pulsar ) in snrs in that they lack strong non - thermal emission components and most of them do not have detectable pulsations . along with other young ns classes including the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , and soft gamma - ray repeaters @xcite , these objects challenge our standard framework for understanding young nss .    because ccos and axps do not have the strong",
    ", broad - band , non - thermal emission typically observed from young crab - like pulsars and their associated synchrotron nebulae , they offer an attractive opportunity for testing the existence of fallback disks by detecting their expected thermal emission .",
    "@xcite showed that the combination of an untruncated outer edge of a fallback disk ( in contrast to a binary accretion disk ) and irradiation of the disk by the central pulsar should lead to a strong thermal excess in the infrared and submillimeter bands . in a previous paper , we reported the detection of a mid - infrared counterpart to the axp 4u 0142 + 61 , which we interpreted as dust emission from an x - ray heated debris disk around the pulsar @xcite . here , we report our ground - based optical / near - ir and _ spitzer space telescope _",

    " indicate that they distinctively differ from other classes of young nss , especially the young rotation - powered pulsars .",

    "this model was primarily proposed as an alternative to the magnetar model for axps in order to explain their `` anomalous '' natures : that their x - ray luminosities are much higher than their rotational energy loss rates ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the x - ray fluxes of most of the ccos , especially our targets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , have been steady based on the observations over the past few years , contrary to the fact that accreting x - ray sources are highly variable ( this is in contrast to 1e  161348@xmath05055.1 , which therefore exclude from the cco category ) . in addition",

    "therefore , even though the ccos are probably not a uniform class of objects , it is very unlikely that their x - ray emission is powered by accretion .",
    "however , it is still possible that isolated , young nss have cool , passive disks",
    ". such a disk would be farther away from a central ns and cooler than an accretion disk .",
    "if they exist , the disks would not contribute to generating x - ray emission from young nss such as the ccos and axps , but their existence might help explain various phenomena of radio pulsars @xcite , planets formation around nss @xcite , or the diversity of young nss @xcite .",

    "as the x - ray luminosities of the ccos are typically lower ( @xmath15@xmath46 erg s@xmath13 ; see table 1 ) , deeper ir exposures are needed in order to reach a comparable ir / x - ray flux ratio .",
    "accordingly , in order to further explore any existence of dust disks around the ccos , rx  j0822.0@xmath04300  would be a plausible target .",

    "the sed is above most of the upper limits on the ccos , indicating that our observations would have detected crab - like young pulsars .",
    "this comparison has additionally shown that the ccos are a different class of young nss from the typical crab - like pulsars .",
    "our optical / ir observations have additionally provided strong constraints on the binary model proposed for the ccos .",
    "as the upper limits of our observations of rx  j0822.0@xmath04300  and 1e  1207.4@xmath05209  are 2426 mag in the optical and 2023 mag in the near - ir ( or @xmath52 ; see figure  [ fig : all ] and note that the x - ray fluxes are around 10@xmath53 ) , they would have detected main - sequence stars down to spectral type m5 regardless of extinction or white dwarfs down to effective temperature @xmath54 10@xmath55 k @xcite , assuming relatively low extinction ( e.g. , @xmath5612 ; @xcite ; see table  1 ) , out to distances of 23  kpc . in summary , we have obtained deep multi - wavelength observations of four ccos in young snrs .",
    "the observations have allowed us to find a near - ir counterpart to the cco in rcw 103 , which probably corresponds to three faint late type stars resolved by high - resolution observations .",
    "in addition , the observations have detected a low mass star close to , but inconsistent with , the current _ chandra _ positions of 1e  1207.4@xmath05209 .",
    "the non - detection of any ir emission from debris disks around three of the ccos could be due to their relatively low x - ray luminosities , compared to 4u  0142 + 61 .",
    "while high background prohibits additional observations of two of the sources , deeper ir observations of rx  j0822.0@xmath04300could probe the existence of a fallback disk around this cco .",
