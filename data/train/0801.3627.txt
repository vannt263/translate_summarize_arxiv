    "the pioneering idea of describing the dynamics of pions at very low energies with an effective field theory was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and later generalized to include the @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles ( that is , including the @xmath7 quark in the light sector ) in ref .",
    "this theory is known as chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath8pt ) and its lagrangian is organized as an infinite tower of increasing dimension operators . beyond the lowest order an increasing number unknown of low energy constants ( lecs for short ) must be included .",
    "the grow of lecs is even more dramatic in the theory with three flavours [ @xmath9 because the cayley - hamilton relations are less restrictive than for the @xmath10 theory .    in a recent paper @xcite axiomatic principles such as analyticity , unitarity , and crossing symmetry",
    "were used to derive universal bounds for two @xmath10 chiral lecs . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath8pt was confronted with axiomatic principles for the first time , and the method was generalized in ref .",
    "some of those bounds found in ref .",
    "@xcite were already known @xcite , but the most stringent conditions can only be found with the procedure of ref .",
    "it was also pointed out that the linear sigma model for @xmath11 has a poor convergence when the @xmath12 field is integrated out of the action , and at least corrections up to @xmath13 must be kept to comply with the positivity bounds .    it is the purpose of the present work to generalize those results to the @xmath14 theory , and in particular to extend the method to cover the situation of different masses [ this is , considering @xmath3 symmetry breaking ] . in this way we will find out if for three flavours @xmath8pt suffers the same anomaly as the linear sigma model .    to our knowledge the first attempt to confront dispersion relations with three - flavour @xmath8pt to bound linear combinations of lecs was ref .",
    "however , in this early work , the contribution from chiral logarithms in the @xmath15 amplitude was ignored .",
    "this simplification becomes exact in the limit of an infinite number of colours , but for a numerical analysis better results are obtained maintaining also chiral loops . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was only possible to assert that certain linear combinations of lecs were positive and no information about the scale at which these lecs were evaluated could be obtained .    in ref .",
    "@xcite qcd inequalities on green functions of quark bilinear currents were used for deriving bounds on some @xmath8pt lecs . as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , we are insensitive to lecs involving external currents , and so our results do not overlap .    since @xmath8pt consists of an expansion in both the external momenta and quark masses , the coefficients of the expansion ( that is , the lecs ) can not depend on either of them .",
    "this means that lecs do not depend on the pseudo - goldstone bosons masses . in other words",
    "the value of chiral lecs in our universe with @xmath16 ( we will consider the isospin limit @xmath17 throughout this paper ) is the same as in `` another '' universe in which the @xmath3 symmetry is unbroken , @xmath18 .",
    "it is common lore in the literature , for instance , to consider massless quarks for estimating the values of some lecs , but this limit is not suitable for a dispersion relation analysis",
    ". the most straightforward generalization of the method used in ref .",
    "@xcite is thus to consider the exact @xmath3 limit in which there are only five independent amplitudes .",
    "the bounds derived in this limit have two drawbacks : first , it is not clear what common mass should be adopted for the degenerate octet , what is essential to compare our bounds with the values obtained by fitting the experimental data ( usually displayed at the @xmath19 scale ) ; second , the results are not very challenging . in order to assess these two problems",
    "we will repeat our analysis with the physical values for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 masses . in this case",
    "the dispersive integrals will imply positivity conditions only under more severe conditions .",
    "once these are addressed the new bounds turn out to be much more restrictive , and remarkably the central values of the fitted lec values lie precisely on the border dictated by axiomatic principles .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : su(3 ) ] we derive the positivity conditions for the amplitudes corresponding to the scattering of pions , kaons and etas in the @xmath20 limit and in sec .  [ sec : bounds-1 ] we transform them into bounds for chiral lecs ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : broken ] we adapt the positivity conditions to the situation of different masses for the pseudoscalar bosons and write a new set of positivity relations ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we show our results ; conclusions are given in sec .",

    "the small ( blue ) triangle in the center is the mandelstam triangle .",
    "the big triangle ( red and blue area ) is the region free from singularities .",
    "the region bounded by the thick black line corresponds to the area @xmath26 in which the positivity conditions are satisfied.[fig : pipi - diagram ] , width=226 ]    in this section we straightforwardly apply the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite to the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar scattering processes . as a first approach we consider the @xmath27 limit , and",
    "so the pseudoscalar octet has a common mass which we denote by @xmath28 .",

    "further details will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : broken ] when we consider flavour symmetry breaking .",
    "since there is no lighter particle in the qcd spectrum than the pseudo - goldstone bosons ( pgs for short ) the analytic structure is fully dictated by two - pgs intermediate states .",
    "much as happened in @xmath29 scattering , the branch cuts emerge for @xmath30 what is equivalent to say that the amplitude is analytic in the mandelstam plane for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this result relies on perturbation theory to all orders @xcite , but using solely axiomatic principles it can be shown ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) that they are at least valid in the interval @xmath33 , which is enough for our purposes .    in the limit",
    "we are considering the qcd lagrangian exhibits an exact @xmath3 symmetry",
    ". then particles are classified according to the different irreducible representations of this group ( _ e.g. _ pgs belong to the real octet representation ) and the wigner - eckart theorem drastically reduces the number of independent amplitudes to six . to see this we simply need to look at the clebsch - gordan decomposition of the direct product of two octets:@xmath34 on the other hand one can find a representation analogous to the chew - mandelstam in @xmath14   identity @xmath35 to make sure that the basis of tensors is minimal .",
    "one can also add four more structures of the type @xmath36 , but they clash after imposing crossing symmetry . ]",

    "[ @xmath40 for @xmath10 and @xmath41 for @xmath9 crossing symmetry implies that there are only @xmath42 independent functions .",
    "this is easy to understand : the @xmath39 irreducible functions @xmath43 @xmath44 translate into @xmath45 degrees of freedom @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 corresponding to the @xmath7- , @xmath49- , and @xmath50- crossed channels , respectively .",
    "crossing symmetry implies @xmath51 restrictions , since it relates the @xmath7-channel amplitudes with the @xmath49- and @xmath50-channel ones ( @xmath51 relations ) .",
    "so we end up with @xmath39 independent degrees of freedom , which is equivalent to @xmath42 independent functions .",
