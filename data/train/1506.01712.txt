    "this study is motivated by the discovery of 47 ultra diffuse galaxies ( udgs ) in the coma cluster by @xcite using the dragonfly telescope array ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dragonfly ) .",
    "this unexpected discovery revealed a new populatoin of low surface brightness ( sb ) galaxies .",
    "indeed , their central sbs are very low 24 - 26@xmath14 in @xmath15-band and their median stellar mass is only @xmath16 , despite their effective radii @xmath17-@xmath18 being as large as those of @xmath19 galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath20 for the milky way ( mw ) , calculated from * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite speculated that the udgs probably have very high dark matter fractions as they have survived in the strong tidal field of the cluster .",
    "dragonfly is optimized to efficiently discover faint structures over a large field of view , but has relatively poor spatial resolution with seeing and pixel scales of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the above properties of the dragonfly udgs were derived after their discovery from archival canada france hawaii telescope imaging .",
    "follow - up studies are needed to understand their nature and origin , as well as their relationship to the cluster environment ( * ? ? ? * for review ) and to other more studied galaxy populations , such as dwarfs and low sbs , in clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite used the subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the subaru telescope and derived a galaxy luminosity function down to @xmath23 in coma .",
    "their three @xmath24 fields include nine dragonfly udgs .",
    "all of the nine were easily found in their catalog , being resolved spatially in the images .",
    "therefore , subaru imaging can identify this new galaxy population efficiently and permits an investigation of their internal properties .",

    ", we use the archival subaru data and report the discovery of 854 udgs , implying @xmath25 udgs after scaling for the dragonfly field - of - view .",

    "we use the ab - magnitude system in this work .",
    "the raw @xmath0 band images from the suprime - cam were obtained from the subaru data archive @xcite .",
    "suprime - cam has a mosaic of ten @xmath31 ccds and covers a wide field of @xmath24 with a pixel scale of @xmath32 .",
    "an eighteen - pointing mosaic with suprime - cam was taken by @xcite and covered about @xmath33 ( figure [ fig : coverage ] ) .",
    "the seeing was @xmath34-@xmath35 , typically @xmath36 .",
    "integration times for the 18 fields were not the same , resulting in variations in background noise , i.e. , @xmath37-@xmath38 ( 1@xmath39 ) in a @xmath40 aperture ( equivalent to @xmath41-@xmath42 in a @xmath43 aperture , @xmath44 mag deeper than @xcite ) .",
    "the very central field has a higher variation of @xmath45 since the field is contaminated by the outer envelope of bright galaxies .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard way @xcite .",
    "we used self - sky flat images , subtracted sky background locally in each small grid ( @xmath46 ; @xmath47 ) , used the wcstools @xcite for astrometry , and applied a photometric calibration @xcite using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)-iii dr9 catalog @xcite .",
    "the grid size for the background subtraction was larger than the expected size of udgs ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the galactic extinction in @xmath0 band varies from 0.016 to 0.031 mag across the 18-field mosaic @xcite .",
    "we adopted the galactic extinction value at the center of each field and neglected variation within each field .",
    "the final photometric error is @xmath49 mag .",
    "more details of the data reduction procedure will be presented in yagi et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , we used the suprime - cam @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and h@xmath3 reduced images ( see figure [ fig : coverage ] ) by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also analyzed a control field for comparison .",
    "the @xmath0 band data of one suprime - cam pointing , 1/18 of the coma field , were taken from the subaru deep field ( sdf ) project @xcite .",
    "we used only a part of the raw sdf exposures taken in june 2008 to make the background noise comparable to that in the coma fields .",
    "the 1@xmath39 background noise in a @xmath40 aperture is @xmath50 .",
    "for consistency we started from the raw data and matched data reduction parameters .",
    "our goal is to find udgs in the subaru images .",
    "forty of the 47 udgs discovered by dragonfly are within the subaru @xmath0 band coverage based on their coordinates @xcite .",
    "all were detected significantly ( with the faintest one , df27 , off by @xmath51 from the published coordinate ) and their structures were resolved in the subaru images .",
    "the detection threshold was approximately 27.3 @xmath52 in the @xmath0 band .",
    "we describe our selection procedure for the final catalog of 854 udgs in the coma cluster .",
    "we found no counterparts in the control field .",
    "we ran sextractor ( version 2.19.5 ; * ? ? ? * ) on individual mosaic frames with a fixed detection threshold of 27.3 @xmath52 in @xmath0 .",
    "we removed a first set of spurious detections using sextractor s `` @xmath53 '' and `` @xmath54 '' .",
    "this initial catalog had 2,627,495 objects , including duplicates in the overlap regions of adjacent mosaic frames ( @xmath55 % ) .",
    "we used the dragonfly udgs as the fiducial set in adjusting parameters for selection of udg candidates , but could not use exactly the same selection criteria as @xcite due to the difference in image quality .",
    "we applied constraints on @xmath0 magnitude and size , `` @xmath56 '' and `` @xmath57 '' ( i.e. , all dragonfly udgs satisfy this condition ) , which left 7,362 objects .",
    "the reported effective radius of the dragonfly udgs is @xmath58 ( using @xmath59 from galfit ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , in the resolved subaru images we found that an alternative constraint , sextractor s @xmath60 , captures all the dragonfly udgs .",
    "we therefore used @xmath61 and a mean sb of @xmath62 to choose udg candidates . [ note that we found that @xmath59 from sextractor and galfit were occasionally very inconsistent",
    "; we use sextractor s @xmath59 for identification and galfit s @xmath59 for studies of structural properties . ]",
    "we excluded objects with high central concentrations ( mostly high - z galaxies ) by removing those whose mean sb within @xmath59 deviates largely from the sb at @xmath59 .",
    "this constraint , @xmath63 , left 1,779 candidates .",
    "the final step was removal of spurious objects by visual inspection .",
    "most spurious detections were due to the crowding in the cluster , such as faint tidal tails and galaxy blending , as well as distant edge - on disk galaxies , artifacts at image edges , and optical ghosts . to minimize human error",
    ", the four authors separately went through all postage stamp images .",
    "after this step and removal of duplications based on their coordinates , 854 udg candidates were left on which at least three of us agreed .",
    "the full catalog will be published by yagi et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the 854 udgs candidates from subaru are visually comparable to the dragonfly udgs .",
    "figure [ fig : colorimage ] shows a sample @xmath64 field , showing the subaru ( green circles ) and dragonfly udgs ( yellow ) . their low sbs are evident compared to the surrounding galaxies , including major galaxies in the cluster and distant background ones .",
    "their large sizes are also clear when compared to the @xmath65 diameter of the circles ( @xmath66 at @xmath67 ) .",
    "the greater number of detections , compared to dragonfly , may be due to the superior seeing ( less blending ) and higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the majority of the 854 candidates are most likely udgs in the coma cluster .",
    "one of them has been spectroscopically confirmed as a cluster member @xcite .",
    "the control sdf field has virtually no counterparts  only thirteen were left after the sextractor - based selection , twelve of which were obvious image artifacts or tails of bright galaxies .",
    "the last one appeared to be a blend of multiple objects .",
    "hence , contamination by non - cluster members is rare and negligible .",
    "note , however , that some negligible number of contaminations might still exist .",
    "for example , the third object from the top in figure [ fig : colorimage ] may be a background spiral galaxy . despite this significantly increased sample ,",
    "the udgs are still a minor population in the coma cluster @xcite .    in the literature",
    ", we found that many of the subaru udgs had been cataloged albeit as more compact objects ; @xcite found 248 of 309 that lay within their coverage , and @xcite 232 of 240 . among them , only 17 were classified as low sb galaxies @xcite .",
    "their large extents and low sbs were revealed for the first time in this study .",
    "we note that eleven out of the 12 dragonfly udgs within their field were also cataloged in @xcite , but none were classified as low sb @xcite .",
    "the galfit package was used to measure the structural parameters of the subaru udgs .",
    "the fits were made with a single sersic profile @xcite with sky background fixed .",
    "we used sextractor s segmentation images to mask surrounding objects .",
    "seventy - nine of the 854 required additional manual masks to exclude a bright compact object(s ) within their boundaries ",
    "interestingly , sixty - seven of these appear to have compact nuclei at their centers .",
    "we judged the fits acceptable based on the goodness - of - fit ( @xmath68 ; 75 objects were thus excluded ) and consistency between galfit and sextractor measurements ( @xmath59 from galfit and sextractor consistent within a factor of 3 ; 11 removed ) . in this section ,",
    "we use the sample of 768 objects with good galfit results , out of which 332 have galfit s @xmath4 ( i.e. , mw - sized udgs as defined in * ? ? ?",
    "we refer to the former full set of galaxies as udgs , and the latter as mw - sized udgs .",
    "figure [ fig : galfit ] shows some examples of galfit results for the udgs of lowest sb , of largest - size , and with a compact nucleus .",
    "figure [ fig : stat](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) show histograms of sersic index ( @xmath69 ) , axis ratio ( @xmath70 ) , and central sb ( @xmath71(r ) ) . for both udgs and mw - sized udgs , their average sersic indices @xmath72-@xmath73",
    "indicate an exponential profile .",
    "the distributions of axis ratio , as well as its average @xmath74-@xmath75 , are skewed toward a large value ; therefore , this udg sample does not consist of randomly - oriented thin - disk galaxies in a statistical sense ( which would skew their distribution toward a low @xmath70 ) .",
    "the @xmath71(r ) ranges around 23 - 26@xmath76 .",
    "these results are consistent with @xcite when the difference in the adopted bands , sdss  @xmath15 and subaru  @xmath0 , is taken into account ( roughly @xmath770.8 mag for the red - sequence in coma ) .",
    "the subaru udgs are likely an extension of normal and dwarf galaxy populations and are not , on their own , a distinct population . figure [ fig : stat](d ) shows the properties of the udgs ( crosses ) with respect to normal galaxies in coma ( circles ; from * ? ? ?",
    "the apparent @xmath0 magnitude of the udgs is 18 to 24 mag , indicating an absolute magnitude of about -12 to -16 mag at the coma distance .",
    "the smallest and faintest udgs ( e.g. , @xmath78 and @xmath79 in figure [ fig : stat]c ) overlap with the largest and brightest dwarf galaxies and share some properties in common with them ( e.g. , the exponential profile , nucleated population ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dotted lines represent constant sbs ( @xmath80s ) from 23 to 29 @xmath81 with a 1 @xmath81 interval , assuming an exponential profile .",
    "the average sb of the subaru udgs is distributed from about 25 @xmath81 ( i.e. , a cut - off due to the selection ) to 28 @xmath81 ( due to the detection limit ; this lower boundary is lower than the pix - to - pix detection limit , because the udgs are extended ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes correspond to stellar masses of @xmath82-@xmath83 if we adopt a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath84 .",
    "note the @xmath85 varies by a factor of @xmath86 for ages of 4 - 12 gyr and metallicities between 0.2 - 1.0 solar based on calculations using starburst99 @xcite , a single starburst , and a kroupa initial mass function .",
    "the udgs are distributed widely over the entire area of the cluster with a concentration toward its center ( figure [ fig : coverage]b ) .",
    "this spatial correlation also supports the assumption that the great majority are cluster members .",
    "figure [ fig : coverage ] nearly covers the virial radius of the cluster ( @xmath87 mpc ; @xmath88 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and reveals their relatively symmetric distribution around the center with a potential elongation toward the south west ( roughly toward ngc 4839 ) .",
    "this symmetric , wide - spread distribution may indicate their long history within the cluster .",
    "the udgs closely follow the red - sequence of a passively - evolving galaxy population on the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "232 udgs are in the catalog of @xcite with both @xmath1 and @xmath0 photometry .",
    "figure [ fig : cmd ] shows their distribution ( green ) .",
    "the comparison data ( red and blue ) show other cluster member galaxies , as well as background galaxies , and are also from @xcite . the red - sequence is evident , and the solid line is a fit by @xcite . clearly , the udgs lie along this red - sequence , and their @xmath1-@xmath0 colors are around 0.8 - 1.0 mag .",
    "this is similar to the trends found among dwarfs and low sb galaxies in clusters @xcite .",
    "no significant h@xmath3 excess was found in udgs .",
    "217 udgs are within the subaru h@xmath3 coverage ( yellow in figure [ fig : coverage]a ) , which was designed to detect faint h@xmath3 emission around coma member galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the udgs are not forming stars at the current epoch , as expected for passively - evolving galaxies .",
    "we report the discovery of @xmath89 udgs in the coma cluster , about 40% of which are mw - sized .",
    "the new udg sample is by no means complete , but already contains 10 - 20 times more than previously known @xcite .",
    "none of the udgs show a signature of tidal distortions ; this is our selection criteria , but indicates that this sample of udgs are not likely recently - disrupted tidal debris .",
    "the udg population , compared to brighter galaxies , is elevated in the coma cluster , although a small number of large , low - sb galaxies are known in the field @xcite .",
    "f the udg - to - brighter galaxy number ratio in coma were common in the field , the expected udg population would be implausibly large , @xmath90 within 100 mpc of the mw . to obtain this rough estimate , we used , as a reference , galaxies in the sdss @xcite within @xmath91 mag ( @xmath92 in absolute magnitude ) at the cluster s redshift of 0.013 - 0.033 @xcite .",
    "the number of reference galaxies in the field was estimated from the luminosity function of @xcite .",
    "the estimated number in the field , @xmath90 , is crude , but seems too large compared to the small number discovered so far .",
    "the cluster environment must play a role in their formation and evolution .",
    "@xcite speculated that the mw - sized udgs might be a dark - matter ( dm ) dominated population in order for them to survive in the strong tidal field around the cluster core .",
    "in fact , the dragonfly udgs spatially avoided the central @xmath93300 pc region as if the ones there had been tidally disrupted ; this apparent disruption was used to constrain the dm fraction ( as large as @xmath94 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "surprisingly , we found udgs even closer to the core ( figure [ fig : coverage]b ) , and the closest one is mw - sized only about @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) away on the sky .",
    "eleven udgs were found within a radius of @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "these detections were , of course , not complete due to the high background emission there , and their apparent proximity may result from a chance coincidence along a line of sight . if any of them are within @xmath99-@xmath100 from the core , an even larger dm mass than the estimate by @xcite is necessary , and the baryon fraction within a tidal radius should be @xmath13 .",
    "this is below the cosmic average , and therefore , the baryons must have been removed from the possibly very deep dm potential .",
    "the possible removal of the gas , and quenching of star formation ( sf ) , are consistent with their red color and clustering in coma ( indicating their longevity within the cluster ) .",
    "the red - sequence can be produced by a metallicity - sequence if galaxies have been evolving passively since sf was quenched @xcite .",
    "physical processes often suggested for the quench include ( see * ? ? ? * for review ) : ( a ) blow out of gas due to galactic winds from supernovae or agn activities @xcite , ( b ) ram - pressure stripping @xcite , ( c ) tidal - interaction and harassment @xcite , and ( d ) starvation due to the cessation of gas infall @xcite .",
    "the elevated population in the cluster indicates that environmentally - driven mechanisms , such as ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) are the most likely solutions [ ( a ) may occur if sf is induced by ( b ) or ( c ) . ] .",
