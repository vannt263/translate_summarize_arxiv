    "astronomers have been making telescopic observations of sunspots since the time of galileo , gradually building a historical record showing a periodic rise and fall in the number of sunspots every 11 years .",
    "we now know that sunspots are regions with a sufficiently strong magnetic field to alter the local thermal structure , so this 11-year sunspot cycle actually traces a variation in surface magnetism .",
    "attempts to understand this behavior theoretically often invoke a combination of differential rotation , convection , and meridional flow to modulate the global field through a magnetic dynamo ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "although we can not observe spots on other solar - type stars directly these areas of concentrated magnetic field produce , among other signatures , strong emission in the ca  ii  h ( 396.8  nm ) and k ( 393.4  nm ) spectral lines .",
    "the intensity of the emission scales with the amount of non - thermal heating in the chromosphere , making these lines a useful spectroscopic proxy for the strength of , and fractional area covered by , magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "@xcite was the first to demonstrate that many solar - type stars exhibit long - term cyclic variations in their ca  ii h and k ( hereafter ca  hk ) emission , analogous to the solar variations .",

    "based on prior single - epoch measurements of its chromospheric activity level , the rotation period of @xmath0  hor was estimated to be 7.9 days @xcite . after normalizing our measurements by the 1.6 year sinusoid , we passed the residuals through a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite to search for the signature of rotation .",

    ", width=312 ]    if we combine the asteroseismic radius of @xmath0  hor , @xmath24 ( s.  vauclair , private communication ) and the rotation period above with the measured @xmath25  kms@xmath26 from @xcite , we can obtain an estimate of the inclination angle , @xmath27 .",
    "if the rotation axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the exoplanet , then the absolute mass of the planet is only about 15% larger than the minimum mass obtained from the radial velocity orbital solution .",
    "the immediate question that arises from the observation of such a short activity cycle is whether we can understand it in the context of dynamo models that are frequently invoked to explain the 11-year solar cycle .",
    "it is generally difficult to extrapolate solar dynamo models to other stars because it is not well understood how the underlying parametrizations change for different stellar properties .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath0  hor we can take advantage of a lucky coincidence  an f8 star with a rotation period near 8 days has a coriolis number @xmath28 that is very similar to that of the sun @xcite .",
    "since the coriolis number characterizes the influence of rotation on convection , it determines to a large extent the overall direction and profile of the turbulent reynolds stresses ( rs ) that drive differential rotation and meridional flow .",
    "the amplitudes are expected to be different due to the higher luminosity and resulting convective velocities ( @xmath29 ) , but it still allows us to make some simple estimates of how various dynamo scenarios considered for the sun are expected to scale to @xmath0  hor .    from a standard stellar evolution model of @xmath0  hor with the global properties inferred from asteroseismology @xcite , we deduce that the convective velocity @xmath30 is 2.8 times higher than the solar value while the relevant timescale @xmath31 is 3.2 times shorter ( due to a smaller pressure scale height ) . using simple scaling relations",
    "these quantities allow us to estimate turbulent diffusivities @xmath32 , @xmath33 that are 2.4 times solar .",
    "the meridional flow speed @xmath34 is expected to be about 2.6 times solar ( from angular momentum transport balance , @xmath35 ) and the differential rotation 2 - 3.3 times solar ( considering thermal balance @xmath36 and angular momentum transport balance @xmath37 ) .",
    "additional scaling factors of order unity can arise from the different depth and aspect ratio of the convection zone .",
    "nevertheless these estimates agree very well with the differential rotation model for an f8 star presented in @xcite .",
    "the above properties would lead us to predict a cycle period of 4 - 5 years for an advection dominated flux - transport dynamo ( @xmath38 ) , or 3.5 - 5 years for a classical @xmath39-@xmath40 dynamo ( @xmath41^{-0.5}$ ] , assuming @xmath42 ) .",
    "these estimates are both more than a factor of two longer than the observed cycle , but for the flux transport dynamo we assumed that the underlying conveyor belt would extend to similar latitudes as observed in the sun . due to the larger aspect ratio of the convection zone in an f8 star as well as the larger magnetic diffusivity , it is conceivable that the flux transport is cut short leading to a significant reduction in the dynamo period .",
    "currently , b.  p.  brown et al .",
    "( in preparation ) are exploring dynamo action in solar - type stars rotating at 3 - 5 times the solar rate using global 3d anelastic mhd models . for a sufficiently large level of turbulence ,",
    "cyclic behavior is found with periods of a few years or less .",
    "these studies demonstrate that computing a detailed 3d model of @xmath0  hor should already be possible .",
    "prior to the discovery of this 1.6-year magnetic cycle in @xmath0  hor , the shortest measured cycle periods were 2.52 years ( hd76151 ) and 2.60 years ( hd190406 ) from the mount wilson survey @xcite . both of these appeared to be secondary cycles superimposed on a much longer primary cycle .",
    "@xcite has suggested , based on the sample of stars with well characterized rotation and cycle periods in @xcite , that the `` active '' and `` inactive '' branches in the @xmath43-@xmath44 diagram may be caused by two distinct dynamos that are driven in different regions of the star .",
    "specifically , @xcite suggests that the active branch may represent a dynamo operating in the near surface shear layer , while the inactive branch is driven by the shear layer at the base of the convection zone . in this scenario ,",
    "stars that exhibit cycle periods on both branches must have the two types of dynamos operating simultaneously .",
    "if the 1.6-year cycle in @xmath0  hor is on the inactive branch , then the active branch cycle period is expected to be near 6 years .",
    "although the previous ca  hk measurements are sparse , we see no evidence of a secular trend in @xmath9 on longer timescales . continued observations by our program should yield stronger constraints on possible slow variations .",
    "recently , @xcite detected the signature of a short magnetic activity cycle in the f5v star hd49933 using asteroseismic measurements from the corot satellite @xcite .",
    "just as in the sun , where the global oscillation modes shift to higher frequencies and lower amplitudes towards the maximum of the 11-year solar cycle , hd49933 appeared to pass through a magnetic minimum during 137 days of continuous observations .",
    "an additional 60 days of data from an earlier epoch could not place strong constraints on the cycle period , but suggested a value between 120 days and about 1 year .",
    "if confirmed by ground - based monitoring of the ca  hk lines , this would place hd49933 ( with @xmath45d ) in the same category of magnetic cycle observed in @xmath0  hor .",
    "the asteroseismic signature of a short magnetic cycle has also been detected in the sun itself .",
    "@xcite analyzed the low - degree solar oscillation frequencies from the bison and golf experiments and found evidence of a quasi - biennial ( 2 year ) signal in both data sets after removing the dominant 11-year period . unlike the 11-year signal , the amplitude of the 2-year variation appeared to be largely independent of frequency , leading the authors to suggest that the secondary cycle must be operating independently .",
    "however , the amplitude of the 2-year signal was uniformly larger during the maximum of the 11-year cycle , suggesting that buoyant magnetic flux might be rising from the base of the convection zone and pumping up a near - surface dynamo with the 2-year period .",
    "active branch stars with a cycle period of 11 years are expected to show a secondary cycle period on the inactive branch around 2 years .",
    "however , this normally occurs in stars rotating at twice the solar rate , and the identification of the two dynamos would then be reversed  with the 11-year dynamo operating in the near - surface shear layer , while the 2-year dynamo is driven at the base of the convection zone .",
    "if short magnetic activity cycles are common , nasa s _ kepler _ mission should detect them in the asteroseismic measurements of many additional stars . in principle such measurements",
    "can provide unique constraints on the underlying physical mechanism , and _ kepler _ will also yield measurements of some of the key dynamo ingredients . even without the short cadence data for asteroseismology ,",
    "the high precision time - series photometry from _ kepler _ is sufficient to characterize the surface differential rotation through detailed spot modeling ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "for the brighter asteroseismic targets where the individual oscillation frequencies are detectable , the time series will be long enough to resolve rotational splitting of the modes into multiplets for stars with rotation rates between about 2 and 10 times the solar rate @xcite .",
    "measurements of the rotational splitting as a function of radial order can indirectly probe radial differential rotation , since the various modes sample slightly different ( but overlapping ) regions of the star .",
    "for the very best and brightest asteroseismic targets , _ kepler _ will obtain a frequency precision sufficient to measure the depth of the surface convection zone from the oscillatory signal in the so - called second frequency differences ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "the _ kepler _ mission is expected to document all of these properties in at least a few dozen solar - type stars , gradually leading to a broader context for our understanding of the solar dynamo .    we would like to thank fred walter for scheduling our smarts program , manuel hernandez and jose velasquez for conducting the observations at ctio , jeffrey hall for assistance in calibrating our chromospheric indices to the mount wilson scale , and bill chaplin for helpful suggestions .",
    "the southern hk survey began with smarts time purchased by high altitude observatory through georgia state university , and was supported for two years under noao long - term program 2008b-0039 with additional time from smarts partners .",
    "the national center for atmospheric research is a federally funded research and development center sponsored by the u.s .   national science foundation ."
