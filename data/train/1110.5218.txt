    "the new  data show variability spanning an unprecedented range in this source , thus supporting its sfxt nature .",
    "furthermore , the frequent presence of strong quasi - periodic flares suggests that this long spin - period pulsar in a relatively compact hmxb ( as implied by the short orbital period ) , might be in an intermediate accretion regime between roche - lobe overflow and wind accretion .",

    "as mentioned above , the first part of the 2011 observation ( time interval d ) was affected by high background level , so in the following we will not use this time interval , except when extracting the spectra from the peaks of the bright flares ( for which the background contribution is negligible ) .",

    "the observability of the periodicity at 1246@xmath3  s @xcite is complicated by the presence of the strong flares which occur on a comparable time scale . folding the data of the whole observation at different trial periods produces several peaks in the @xmath14 distribution . on the other hand , by restricting the period search to the central part of the 2011 observation ( interval e ) , when the source was in a low intensity and non - flaring state , the x  ray pulsations are clearly detected at a period , p , of 1212@xmath15  s ( @xmath14=252 , for 9 dof ) .",

    "contrary to that obtained in 2011 , it shows a single broad peak .",
    "we finally performed a timing analysis of a series of @xmath6/pca archival observations carried out between 2009 april 5 and april 15 , obtaining a best fit spin period of 1209.4@xmath17  s. the comparison of the pulse periods measured with  in 2004 and 2011 and with @xmath6 in 2009 does not show significant spin - up or spin - down .",

    "this led to suggest  as a member of the class of the supergiant fast x ",
    "ray transients ( sfxts , @xcite ; see @xcite for an updated review of the sfxts properties ) .",
    "it has been classified as a `` candidate '' sfxt because the supergiant nature of its optical counterpart has not been confirmed yet , and the x  ray dynamic range was not as extreme as the prototypical sfxts ( typically , from 3 to 5 orders of magnitudes in x  ray intensity ) . among sfxts ,  is , after igr  j164794514 and igr  j184830311 , the source with the most frequent bright flaring activity ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our  observation allowed us to continuously follow the source variability with unprecedented detail and to reveal , for the first time in this source , a wide dynamic range , typical of other so - called `` intermediate '' sfxts , like e.g. igr  j184830311 @xcite or igr  j16465 - 4507 @xcite .",
    "the x  ray light curve observed in 2011 showed two episodes of bright flaring activity ( exceeding 10  counts  s@xmath1 in the first part of the exposure ) , separated by an interval of low intensity emission , where the source faded to less than @xmath00.1  counts  s@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lczoom ] , middle panel ) .",
    "the two flaring intervals ( d and f ) were characterized by different variability patterns : in the first one the flux reached the peak during the longest flare ( @xmath04000  s ) and showed a variety of flare shapes , while in interval f the flares had a more regular appearance , with a hint of a quasi  periodic pattern of a few ks , not related with the long spin period ( see the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lczoom ] ) . a quasi ",
    "periodic flaring was also present in the central part of the 2004 observation ( time interval b in fig .  1 ) .",
    "as visible in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lczoom ] , the variability consisted of two sub - sets of four flares each , recurring every @xmath0380400  s.    ccc +   +    quasi ",
    "periodic flares have been seen also in other hmxbs , including some sfxts ( e.g. xte  j1739302 , see @xcite ) . for example , in the be / x - ray transient exo  2030 + 375 flares recurring on timescales of 3.96@xmath19  hr , and intensity oscillations with periods of 900 - 1200  s , were observed and explained with the formation and disruption of a temporary and transient accretion disk around the neutron star @xcite . although in exo  2030 + 375 both the flare shapes ( well described by a fast rise and an exponential decay ) and the time recurrence were more regular , it is possible that a similar mechanism is responsible for the  flaring activity .",
    "the model proposed by @xcite predicts that similar recurrence time scales for the flares can be well reproduced by a relative velocity of the neutron star with respect to the outflowing wind of about 12001400  km  s@xmath1 ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we note a striking similarity between the  light curve observed in 2011 and the prediction of hydrodynamic simulations for systems accreting in the so - called `` transitional case '' between `` pure '' wind accretion and `` full '' roche lobe overflow @xcite . according to these simulations , in this particular transitional accretion regime ,",
    "when the mass donor is close to fill its roche lobe , the hmxb can display an x  ray light curve very similar to what we observed in , both for what concerns the variability time scale and its dynamic range ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lczoom ] , middle panel ) . the mass loss from the supergiant",
    "is dominated by the strong wind , but with the additional contribution of a weak tidal gas stream , focussed towards the neutron star ( hereafter , ns ) .",
    "this mechanism produces extreme variations in the mass accretion rate , mainly due to the dynamical interaction of the weak tidal gas stream with the accretion bow shock around the ns @xcite .",
    "we are aware that these simulations have been performed in two dimensions ( computing the gas flow within the orbital plane ) and the real 3d case is much more complex , but nevertheless we think that the similarity with the observed light curve deserves attention and further investigation .",
    "similarly , @xcite discussed the case of hmxbs with short orbital periods ( p@xmath203 - 4.5 days ) , such as , as sources where the orbits are typically narrow making accretion via `` beginning atmospheric roche - lobe overflow '' an attainable mechanism to produce x  ray emission . in general , under the assumption that a supergiant star has a sharply defined radius ( e.g. the photospheric radius ) , roche lobe overflow starts as soon as such radius extends beyond the roche lobe .",
    "however , in reality the supergiant star does not have a sharp edge or radius and above its photosphere there is still atmospheric material in the form of strong stellar wind .",
    "consequently , already before the photospheric radius reaches the roche lobe , a small part of the stellar wind can begin to flow towards the neutron star through the inner lagrangian point . in principle , this could also favour the formation of a transient and temporary accretion disk whose disruption could produce the observed quasi - periodic flares from .    given the short orbital period of 3.7389  days , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : roche ] the roche lobe radius of the companion star at periastron , as a function of its mass and for different system eccentricities @xcite .",
    "the radii of massive early type stars of different luminosity classes @xcite are also plotted for comparison .",
    "the 32.8  kk best fit effective temperature can range from 36 kk to 10.6 kk ] of the candidate counterpart @xcite indicates a o8.5o9.5 type star , which can be in a narrow circular orbit with the ns , avoiding roche lobe overflow .",
    "for example , a o9  ia ( o8.5  ia ) star with a mass of 46  @xmath21 ( 50  @xmath21 ) and a radius of 24  r@xmath22 @xcite in a circular orbit is consistent with the optical and x  ray observations .",
    "another viable possibility is a o9.5  iii companion with a mass of 24  @xmath21 and a radius of @xmath015  r@xmath22 . in this case",
    "the eccentricity can range from e=0 to e@xmath00.2 without exceeding the roche lobe surface .",
    "we are aware that the above speculations on the optical counterpart are rather uncertain in the lack of an optical spectrum , but we here only note that an early type supergiant ( and a sfxt nature ) is compatible with the short orbital period . moreover , a narrow orbit in a massive binary is required in the `` transitional case '' we suggested above to explain properties .",
    "comparison of the 2011 spectral results with the previous observation shows a lower absorbing column density in 2011 than in 2004 .",
    "however , in both occasions , the absorption was well in excess with respect to the total galactic column density towards the source .",
    "it is possible that the variability of the absorption in the two observations is due to the different orbital phases covered by the two observations , but the uncertainties on the orbital parameters do not allow us to determine the absolute orbital phase covered by two spectra . the local absorbing column density due to the supergiant wind in a hmxbs is expected to vary along the orbit , even in case of a spherically symmetric wind , also in dependence of the inclination of the system .",
    "further variability can be due to the presence of different gas structures ( accretion wake around the ns together with tidal effects which induce a gas stream from the supergiant ) which form because of the presence of the ns gravitational field @xcite .",
    "another important result is that the possible hint for a soft excess present in 2004 , is now well established by the 2011 observation and it is compatible with the presence of a ionized absorber . in particular , the cumulative x  ray spectrum during the flares observed in 2011 ( f ) is well described introducing an additional ionized absorber , resulting in an absorber ionization state , @xmath23 , of 125  @xmath24  erg  cm  s@xmath1 , and an absorbing column density , n@xmath25 , of @xmath26@xmath27@xmath13  @xmath11 . in the likely hypothesis of the wind photo - ionization , the above value of the ionization parameter @xmath23 indicates , for example",
    ", the presence of highly ionized oxygen ( o  viii ) and neon ( ne  x ions ) @xcite , whose lines could have been observed in the rgs energy range , if the source had been brighter and less absorbed .",
    "the average x  ray flux during flares , corrected for both interstellar and local ( ionized ) absorption is 5@xmath28  erg  @xmath11  s@xmath1 ( 110 kev ) , which implies a ionizing x  ray luminosity l=@xmath29  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "although the @xmath23 value we obtained is very likely an average value , it is possible to calculate the distance , r , from the x  ray source of the main component of the absorbing ionized material . using the measured n@xmath25 value and assuming n@xmath25 = nr",
    ", we obtain a distance r=5@xmath27@xmath30  cm , which is compatible with the ns accretion radius , and well within the orbital separation ( @xmath010@xmath31  cm ) of the binary system .",
    "the new  observations we have reported here allowed us to perform an in - depth investigation of the transient source .",
    "a high dynamic range has been observed for the first time , of about two orders of magnitude , leading to a firmer classification of as a member of the class of the sfxts .",
    "we obtained a more precise value of the pulse period and we clearly established the presence of a soft x ",
    "ray excess in the flares x  ray spectrum , which we interpreted as due to the presence of ionized wind material , mainly located at a distance compatible with the ns accretion radius .",
    "the absorbing column density variations between 2004 and 2011 are likely due to the different orbital phases covered between the two observations .",
    "the low intensity emission is both softer and more absorbed than during bright flares .",
    "the kind of x  ray variability ( its high dynamic range on the observed time scale ) , together with the candidate optical counterpart , the short orbital period and the quasi - periodic flaring activity , all suggest that the x  ray emission from is driven by a transitional accretion regime , intermediate between `` pure '' wind accretion and `` full '' roche lobe overflow .    in conclusion , we suggest here for the first time that this hypothesis could explain both  x  ray behaviour and possibly other sfxts with similarly short orbital periods .",
