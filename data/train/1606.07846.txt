    "the above result , of course , answers the question , under which condition two different schubert varieties @xmath24 and @xmath31 have the same zariski tangent space . on the contrary , the structure of tangent cones  @xmath28 , although it has been an active area of research ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , is not well understood , in particular , the problem of their coincidence is mostly open .",
    "let us consider some examples . if @xmath51 , then @xmath52 and the local coordinates are @xmath53 .",
    "there are 6 schubert varieties of dimensions @xmath54 , and the middle four are : @xmath55 in our local coordinates these are @xmath56 , respectively .",

    "the first examples of singular schubert varieties appear when @xmath60 .",
    "there are two of them : @xmath61 our local coordinates in the 6-dimensional manifold @xmath0 are @xmath62 , the equations of the two schubert varieties are @xmath63 and @xmath64 and the tangent cones are , respectively , the cone @xmath65 in the hyperplane @xmath66 and the cone @xmath64 . in the whole space @xmath27 .",

    "different tangent cones can share components and even contain each other .",
    "the simplest example is provided by the 8-dimensional schubert varieties @xmath68 with respect to the local coordinates @xmath69 , the first two varieties ( and hence their tangent cones ) are linear subspaces @xmath70 and @xmath71 , while the third one is described by the equations @xmath72=0 $ ] .",

    "let us mention two cases when the coincidence of these tangent cones is known , or can be easily proved .",
    "the first one is the equality @xmath76 which holds for every permutation @xmath15 .",
    "this fact was conjectured ( and checked for @xmath77 ) in  @xcite ; however , a short direct proof can be easily given , see section  [ proofdirect ] .",
    "the second case is that of _",
    "coxeter elements _ of the permutation group .",
    "recall that an element @xmath14 is called a coxeter element , if it is of length @xmath78 and can be written in the form@xmath79 in such a way that every transposition @xmath80 , for @xmath81 enters the above product exactly once .",
    "the group @xmath13 has @xmath82 different coxeter elements .",
    "the schubert varieties which correspond to the coxeter elements of @xmath13 have the same tangent cone ; this follows from the fact that these schubert varieties are non - singular at @xmath10 , and hence their tangent cones coincide with their zariski tangent spaces ( see section  [ mthsec ] for details ) . by the way",
    ", our example of coinciding tangent cones for @xmath51 represents both cases : the permutations @xmath83 and @xmath84 are coxeter elements inverse to each other . for @xmath60 , all pairs of permutations with equal tangent cones are either coxeter , or inverse to each other .",
    "however , for @xmath67 , there appear pairs of non - inverse and non - coxeter permutations with equal tangent cones ; the first example of such a pair is @xmath85 .",
    "we develope an efficient method to recognize when the tangent cones of two schubert varieties coincide .",
    "the main ingredient of this method is the notion of a _",
    "pillar entry_. every schubert cell of the flag variety is determined by the @xmath86 matrix of dimensions  @xmath87 of the intersections @xmath88 called the rank matrix ; the corresponding schubert variety is determined by inequalities @xmath89 .",
    "for example , if @xmath90 $ ] is the rank matrix corresponding to a permutation @xmath15 , then the rank matrix corresponding to @xmath91 is obtained from  @xmath90 $ ] by a transposition . in section  5.6",
    ", we prove that the whole matrix @xmath90 $ ] is determined by a relatively small set of entries , which we call _ pillar entries _",
    "( see section  [ pildesect ] for a precise definition ) .",
    "note that the notion of pillar entry is very close ( yet different from ) fulton s notion of essential set  @xcite , see the appendix for a comparison .",
    "we conjecture that if @xmath34 , then the pillar entries for @xmath26 are obtained from pillar entries for @xmath15 by a",
    "_ partial transposition _ : if @xmath92 is a pillar entry for @xmath26 , then precisely the entries one of @xmath93 is a pillar entry for @xmath15 , and this entry is equal to @xmath92 ( and the same is true with the exchange @xmath94 ) ; see section  [ cosec ] , conjecture  [ theconjthm ] for a precise statement .",
    "however , the converse of this conjecture is false : examples show that a partial transposition of the set of pillar entries may lead to a set of entries which is not the set of pillar entries for any transposition , or is a set of pillar entries os a transposition of a different length .",
    "some pillar entries are  linked , \" that is , they can be transposed or not transposed only simultaneously .    in sections 3.2 and 3.3 ,",
    "we give some definition of a linkage , and hence of  admissible partial transposition \" ; our main result is theorem  [ thethm ] , which states that an admissible partial transposition of pillars entries of @xmath15 provides a set of pillar entries of some @xmath26 , and that in this case @xmath34 .",
    "however , examples show that our definition of linkage is not sufficient : there are partial transpositions of pillar entries , which are not admissible in our sense , but which still preserve the tangent cone .",
    "we also provide a number of examples and several enumerative results in small dimension and codimension .",
    "we were led by the numeric examples to the following `` @xmath95-conjecture '' ( which is also closely related with the earlier mentioned conjecture ) : the number of schubert varieties with an identical tangent cone is always a power of @xmath96 .    let us mention that the problem of classification of tangent cones of schubert varieties is closely related to the problem of classification of coadjoint orbits of the unitriangular group , see  @xcite and the recent work  @xcite . as we already said , the tangent space to the flag variety is naturally identified with the nilpotent lie algebra of lower - triangular matrices , and with the dual space of the lie algebra of upper - triangular matrices : @xmath97 the @xmath12-action on @xmath27 then coincides with the coadjoint action .",
    "every tangent cone @xmath28 is @xmath12-invariant , as well as any irreducible component of @xmath28 ; thus , it is a set of @xmath12-orbits .",
    "however , it is not true that @xmath12-orbits and irreducible components of tangent cones are the same thing . the first example which demonstrates this appears in @xmath98 : the 6-dimensional tangent cone @xmath99 is a union of 5-dimensional @xmath12-orbits .",
    "we will not discuss this phenomenon in this paper .",
    "we recall the classical notion ( and some properties ) of rank matrix associated with two flags .",
    "rank matrices provide a combinatorial way to characterize schubert varieties and schubert cells .",
    "indeed , one of these flags will be chosen as the standard flag , so that the rank matrix coincides with the rank function of the corresponding permutation ; see  @xcite .",
    "we then define the notion of pillar entry of a rank matrix which is crucial for us .",
    "we formulate our first conjecture that if two permutations , @xmath15 and @xmath26 , have identical tangent cones : @xmath34 , then the pillar entries of the corresponding rank matrices either coincide or transposed to each other .      for any flag , the _ rank matrix _ is the @xmath86 matrix @xmath100 $ ] with the integer entries @xmath101 the rank matrix is independent of the choice of a flag in a @xmath12-orbit .",
