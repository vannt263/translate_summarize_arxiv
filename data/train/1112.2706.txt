    "for low - redshift cosmology and galaxy formation rates , it is important to account for all the baryons synthesized in the big bang .",
    "cosmologists have noted a baryon deficit in the low - redshift universe ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) relative to the predicted density synthesized in the big bang . although this deficit could arise from an incomplete inventory , it could also challenge our understanding of the thermodynamics of structure formation and the response of the gas to accretion shocks and galactic outflows .",
    "recent analysis ( komatsu et  al .  2011 ) of the spectrum of acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) obtained by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) found that baryons comprise a fraction @xmath22 of the critical matter - energy density of the universe , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the hubble constant ( @xmath25 ) in units of 70 km  s@xmath26  mpc@xmath26 .",

    "baryon inventories in the low redshift universe are uncertain .",
    "they are often complicated by the formation of galaxies and large - scale structure and by the feedback from star formation in the form of ionizing radiation , metals , and outflows .",
    "galaxy surveys have found @xmath3110% of these baryons in collapsed objects such as galaxies , groups , and clusters ( salucci & persic 1999 ; bristow & phillipps 1994 ; fukugita & peebles 2004 ) . over the last 15 years , substantial reservoirs of gas have been found in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , in the halos of galaxies , and in the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) .",

    "unfortunately , x - ray spectra still have not confirmed the potential large reservoir of baryons at @xmath33  k , suggested by cosmological simulations .    an inefficient distribution of collapsed baryons vs.  distributed matter is a prediction of nearly all cosmological simulations of large - scale structure formation ( cen & ostriker 1999 , 2006 ; dav et  al .  1999 , 2001 ; smith et  al .  2011 ; tepper - garcia et  al .",

    "the influence of the radiation background through photoheating and photoionization is included in the cooling of both the primordial and metal species .",
    "our ` enzo ` unigrid simulations ( smith et  al .",
    "2011 ) , post - processed in the current paper , are among the best current work in describing the temperature , metallicity , and ionization state of the hot gas ( whim ) and photoionized gas .",
    "our results have been checked for convergence ( smith et  al .",

    "we have tested the results from several runs with different box sizes , resolutions , and modes of feedback ( local and distributed ) , finding similar results , as described later .",
    "our use of unigrid ( rather than adaptive - mesh - refinement ) hydrodynamics was deliberate , to provide optimal hydrodynamic resolution of the igm and whim .",

    "agertz et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) noted that eulerian grid - based methods are able to resolve and treat important dynamical instabilities such as kelvin - helmholtz or rayleigh - taylor , whereas these processes are poorly resolved by sph techniques .",

    "( 2007 ) pointed to the significantly different phase diagrams of shocked cells in grid codes compared to sph , with sizable differences in the morphologies of accretion shocks between grid and sph methods .",
    "we have employed a sophisticated treatment of metal cooling and heating ( smith , sigurdsson , & abel 2008 ; smith et  al .",

    "( 2011 ) find igm phases with markedly different temperatures and metallicities , but we believe these results arise from their metal - injection schemes and the lack of mixing . none of the other major simulation groups ( cen & ostriker 2006 ; cen & chisari 2011 ; tepper - garcia et  al .  2011 ;",
    "smith et  al .  2011 ; cen 2012 ) can reproduce their results on igm temperature and ionization state .",
    "our @xmath53 simulations have better hydrodynamic resolution than all of the tepper - garcia et  al .",
    "simulations ( @xmath54 ) and dav & oppenheimer models ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "our paper was the only one to test for convergence , and we concluded that our @xmath53 models were robust .",
    "it has sometimes been suggested that the use of  unigrid \" _ enzo _ calculations casts doubt on the validity of the results for metallicity production and transport , compared to adaptive - mesh - refinement ( amr ) .",
    "just the opposite is true .",
    "in fact , amr does not provide a better computation of the global star formation rate , as we examined ( smith et  al .",
    "2011 ) . in these simulations , star formation seems to be dependent on the force resolution on the root grid .",
    "stars do not form in the lower - resolution simulations because the halos do not collapse correctly at early times when there is no refinement occurring in the box . by the time refinement happens , it is already too late ; the collapse of the halos has already been delayed , owing to the poor force resolution .",
    "we have verified this by running simulations , with and without amr , at the same resolution on the top grid .",
    "we find almost the exact same star - formation history .",
    "for this reason , we decided to use high resolution everywhere and put our computational resources into a large unigrid : @xmath53 in this paper , and moving to @xmath56 in recent work at @xmath57 ( shull et  al .",
    "2012a ) .",
    "we use a modified version of the star - formation routine of cen & ostriker ( 1992 ) .",
    "star particles , representing the combined presence of a few million solar masses of stars , are formed when the following three conditions are met : the total density of a grid cell is above a certain threshold , a convergent flow exists ( negative velocity divergence ) , and the cooling time is less than the dynamical time .",
    "star particles return feedback to the grid in the form of metal - enriched gas and thermal energy .",
    "we use a distributed - feedback method ( smith et  al .",
    "2011 ) in which material and energy are distributed over a 27-cell cube ( three cells on a side ) centered on the location of the star particle .",
    "this is done to mitigate the over - cooling that occurs when feedback is deposited into a single grid cell , which raises the temperature , gas density , and cooling rate to unphysically high values .",
    "over - cooling also causes the winds that should be transporting metals into the igm to fizzle out and remain confined to their sites of origin .",
    "smith et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed that this model is able simultaneously to provide good matches to the global star formation history and the observed number density per unit redshift of   absorbers ( danforth & shull 2008 ) .",
    "if all three above conditions are satisfied , a  star particle , \" representing a large collection of stars , is formed within the grid cell with a total mass , @xmath58 . here ,",
    "@xmath59 is the star - formation efficiency , @xmath60 is the baryon mass in the cell , @xmath61 is the dynamical time , and @xmath62 is the hydrodynamical timestep .",
    "subsequently , this much mass is also removed from the grid cell as the star particle is formed , ensuring mass conservation .",
    "although the star particle is formed instantaneously within the simulation , feedback is assumed to occur over a longer time scale , which more accurately reflects the gradual process of star formation .",
    "stellar feedback is represented by the injection of thermal energy and the return of gas and metals to the grid , in amounts proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "we assume that a fraction ( 25% ) of the stellar mass is returned to the grid as gas .",
    "the thermal energy and metals returned to the grid are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the ratio of rest - mass energy to thermal energy and @xmath67 is the metal yield . the rate of star formation and rate at which thermal energy and metals are injected into the grid by the star particle peak after one dynamical time , then decays exponentially .    in the current project , we seek to understand the thermal and ionization state of the igm , including the distribution and covariance of metallicity , temperature , and  ionization fraction . in our simulations ,",
    "the physical properties of  absorbers and the degree to which they trace the whim are in good agreement with other recent simulations ( tepper - garcia et  al .",
    "2011 ; cen & chisari 2011 ) . however , they differ significantly from those of oppenheimer & dav ( 2009 , 2011 ) , who found that  and   originate almost exclusively in warm ( @xmath68k ) photoionized gas .",
    "tepper - garcia et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) suggested that much of this difference arises because oppenheimer & dav ( 2009 ) neglected the effect of photoionization on metal - line cooling .",
    "oppenheimer et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) investigated this claim by running additional simulations in which photoionization reduced the metal cooling .",
    "this reduction resulted in a small , but insufficient number of  absorbers associated with whim gas .",
    "instead , they point to the fact that they do not include the mixing of metals from their galactic - wind particles , allowing feedback to take the form of cold , heavily enriched clouds .    in examining the various interpretations of the high ions (  and )",
    ", we have identified several key differences between the two codes : the oppenheimer - dav smooth particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) code and our grid - based approach with ` enzo ` .",
    "the disagreement between the igm temperatures and ionization mechanisms appear to arise from four effects : ( 1 ) different methods of injecting energy and metals ( mixed or unmixed ) ; ( 2 ) over - cooling of unmixed , metal - enriched gas at high density and high metallicity ; ( 3 ) differences in shock capturing ( and shock - heating ) between sph and grid codes ; ( 4 ) differences in photoionization rates through the assumed radiation fields at @xmath69 ev .",
    "all four possibilities merit careful comparative studies , although we believe the resolution of this  controversy may ultimately hinge on understanding the nature of galactic winds and their ability to mix heavy elements into igm .",
    "the  lyman-@xmath1 forest \" of absorption lines appears to contain @xmath3130% of the low-@xmath32 baryons ( penton et  al .",
