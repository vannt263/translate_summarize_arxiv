    "random multiplicative cascades were introduced by the russian school @xcite in order to describe the energy transfer from large to small scales in fully developed turbulence @xcite .",
    "theses processes , further studied by b. mandelbrot @xcite ( and usually referred to as `` mandelbrot cascades '' ) are built using an iterative rule that spreads some measure ( which can represent mass , energy , ... ) from large to smaller scales : the measure of the two half sub - intervals of some given interval is obtained by multiplication of its mass by two independent random factors which law remains the same at all scales .",
    "mandelbrot cascades were also generalized to measures supported by sets of non - integer dimension ( see below ) .",
    "the main problem with such `` grid bound '' random cascades is that they are always constructed on a bounded interval ( the starting largest scale ) , they are not stationary processes and they necessarily involve some preferred scale ratio . in that respect , they can hardly be used to reproduce faithfully natural phenomena like the energy dissipation in fully developed turbulence or the volatility in financial markets .",
    "the first continuous extension of mandelbrot cascades was proposed a decade ago by barral and mandelbrot @xcite .",
    "these authors replaced the regular tree - like construction underlying previous iterative scheme by a `` random tree '' associated with the draw of a poisson process in the `` time - scale '' half - plane .",
    "later , bacry and muzy @xcite extended this construction by replacing the compound poisson law by any infinitely divisible law .",
    "the main advantage of continuous random cascades is that they provide a large class of models that are stationary and possess continuous scale invariance properties .",
    "they can be considered as the paradigm of random multifractal processes and they have found applications in many domains like turbulence or empirical finance ( see e.g ref.@xcite for a recent review ) .    the goal of this paper is to construct models of continuous cascades that are not necessarily supported by the whole real line but by sets of zero ( lebesgue ) measure . for that purpose",
    ", we will introduce a family of stationary random self - similar cantor sets , i.e. , closed sets that contain no interval @xcite .",
    "these sets turn out to be a particular version of the construction proposed by mandelbrot in early seventies that consists in cutting the real line `` at random '' with some given distribution of `` cutouts '' @xcite .",
    "we show this self - similar version can be the support of a continuous log - infinity divisible random cascade .",
    "we study the main properties of the proposed model and consider , as a first application , the statistical modeling of precipitations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : casc ] we recall how discrete and continuous cascades are defined and how a time - scale approach can be conveniently used to go from the former to the later .",
    "along the same line , we study in section [ sec : cantors ] , how classical deterministic and discrete constructions of cantor sets could be extended to a continuous scale framework .",
    "this leads us to rediscover the mandelbrot random cutouts and to introduce a version that is exactly self - similar .",
    "we study the fractal dimension of these random sets and the statistics of their void size .",
    "the general model , namely a self - similar multifractal random measure lying on a random cantor set is introduced in section [ sec : meas ] .",
    "we show that the model is well - defined ( i.e. the construction converges to a non trivial limit ) and is indeed self - similar in a stochastic sense with ( multi-)scaling properties that extend those of continuous cascades to non - integer dimensions .",
    "we provide various examples in section [ sec : examples ] and consider an application to account for the intermittency of precipitation rates .",
    "in particular , we show that our approach allows one to reproduce very well the statistics of the dry period lengths .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in section [ sec : conclusion ]   while the more technical parts of this paper are reported in appendices .",
    "a convenient way to describe the construction of a mandelbrot cascade over the interval @xmath0 $ ] is the following : let @xmath1 denote the indicator function of the set @xmath2 and let us the function : @xmath3 one thus has @xmath4 if @xmath5 and @xmath6 otherwise .",
    "the mandelbrot random cascade is the weak limit , when @xmath7 , of the sequence of densities : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 denotes the dyadic intervals @xmath11 and @xmath12 are independent copies of a positive random variable such that @xmath13}=1 $ ] .",
    "kahane and peyrire @xcite proved that such a sequence has almost surely a non - trivial limit provided @xmath14 } < 0 $ ] .",
    "barral and mandelbrot proposed a stationary , `` grid free '' version of cascade models by replacing the dyadic grid ( represented by the dyadic intervals in eq . ) with a poisson process in the time - scale plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : casc ] ) .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath15 be the events of a poisson process of intensity @xmath16 .",
    "( it corresponds to the left haar measure ) . ] with each couple @xmath17 one can associate a time interval @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a largest interval size ( the so - called `` integral scale '' in turbulence cascade models ) . let @xmath20 be i.i.d",
    ". copies of a positive random variable such that @xmath13 } = 1 $ ] .",
    "the barral - mandelbrot measure of integral scale @xmath21 is then defined as the ( weak ) limit , when @xmath22 , of the density : is not introduced in that way but the definition below corresponds to an exactly self - similar version . ]",
    "@xmath23    barral - mandelbrot construction was extended by bacry and muzy @xcite that proposed to replace the ( compound ) poisson measure in the time - scale plane with any infinitely divisible random measure @xmath24 .",
    "the extension relies on the the following remark : if one denotes by @xmath25 the domain in the time - scale plane such that , for each @xmath26 , @xmath27 , then eq . can be rewritten as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the poisson measure of intensity @xmath16 compound with the random variable @xmath30 .",
    "bacry and muzy suggest to replace the compound poisson law with a general infinitely divisible law @xmath24 and consider the weak limit of the density ( see appendix [ cone_app ] ) : @xmath31 this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : casc ] . in the following",
    "we will denote by @xmath32 the so - defined limit measure , i.e. @xmath33",
    "the previous framework allows one to construct stationary random measures that are supported by the whole real line . as discussed in the introductory section , it could be interesting to extend these constructions to situations where the measure is supported by a set of non - integer dimension .",
    "the paradigm of such set is the so - called cantor set , and notably the ternary cantor set ( also called `` triadic '' or `` middle third '' cantor set ) that can be constructed as follows : one starts with some interval that can be chosen to be @xmath34 $ ] with no loss of generality . at the first step ,",
    "one deletes the middle third open interval @xmath35 to obtain @xmath36 \\cup [ 2/3,1]$ ] .",
    "the operation is then repeated on @xmath37 and @xmath38 which middle third interval is deleted and so on _ ad infinitum_. one can show that the limit set @xmath39 , i.e. , the set of points of @xmath40 $ ] that are not removed by the previous iterative construction , exists and is non trivial .",
    "it is a so - called `` cantor set '' in the sense that it is a closed set of uncountable cardinality that contains no interval .",
    "it is well known that @xmath39 is a self - similar set of zero length ( lebesgue measure ) and of fractal dimension @xmath41 .",
    "let us notice that various random extension of the previous construction have been considered in the literature by , for example , picking randomly the scale of the subdivision at each construction step ( @xmath42 ) or the position of the deleted interval .",
    "one of the most famous random cantor model is the so - called @xmath43 model introduced by frisch , sulem and nelkin @xcite . at each step of the division ( by e.g a factor 2 ) ,",
    "one keeps each subinterval with a probability @xmath43 and one removes it with a probability @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 stands for the fractal dimension of the so - obtained limit set , at step @xmath46 ( and thus at scale @xmath47 ) , it remains in average @xmath48 subintervals .",
    "the dimension @xmath45 is therefore @xmath49 .",
    "however , for the same reasons that grid bound cascades are not convenient for most physical applications , these approaches are not satisfactory : they do involve a preferred scale ratio and are not invariant by time translation .",
    "it is then natural to address the question of their extension to a `` continuous '' and stationary version .    the first attempt to solve this problem",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the author considered a `` continuous '' @xmath43 model by letting the scale ratio at each construction step going to @xmath50 and considering in the same time @xmath51 in such a way that the dimension @xmath45 remains constant .",
    "if this approach is formally appealing , it remains hard to handle mathematically since a scale ratio that approaches @xmath50 corresponds to strongly overlapping subintervals . in a more recent paper @xcite ,",
    "schmitt proposed an extension of the @xmath43 model in the framework of log - infinitely divisible distributions as described in the previous section .",
    "although this paper proposes a very interesting path towards continuous cantor sets and can be directly related to our construction , the author did not considered the existence of the small scale limit of his model and neglected the necessary time correlations in the random factors he introduced ( see section [ sec : mf ] ) .    in order to go from discrete ( i.e. grid bound ) cantor sets to their continuous analog ,",
    "let us first remark that , within the representation introduced of sec .",
    "[ sec : casc ] for continuous cascades @xcite , the construction of the ternary cantor set @xmath39 can be redefined as follows : if one considers for some given point @xmath52 in the time - scale plane , the interval @xmath53 centered at @xmath54 and of size @xmath55 , then @xmath56 with @xmath57 \\setminus \\bigcup_{m=1}^n \\ ; \\ ; \\bigcup_{t_k \\in e_m } { { \\cal i}}_{t_{k},s_m}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the set of @xmath60 points defined by the recurrence @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the set @xmath63 is depicted in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cantor ] where we have represented the locations of the points @xmath64 in the half - plane @xmath52 associated with its 3 components .    a natural way to ",
    "randomize  this definition in a fully stationary way is then to follow the same approach as in the barral - mandelbrot generalization of grid bound cascades : one simply replaces the fixed locations @xmath65 in the @xmath66 half - plane with random locations drawn using a poisson point process of intensity chosen in order to preserve the density of the triadic grid .",
    "let @xmath67 be the intensity of a poisson process homogeneous with respect to the natural measure of the time - scale half - plane .",
    "one seeks for @xmath68 such that the density of points in the poisson case corresponds to the one of the ternary cantor set .",
    "since at each generation , one deletes one third of the remaining intervals , if @xmath69 is the probability to have no poisson point within the domain @xmath70 $ ] and @xmath71 $ ] , one must have @xmath72 . from poisson distribution properties , we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the intensity of the number of poisson points in the domain @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath71 $ ] ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath75 it thus results that @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath77 where @xmath41 is the fractal ( capacity or hausdorff ) dimension of the cantor set .",
    "the previous example suggests to introduce a new construction of a random cantor @xmath78 supported by the whole real line by removing random intervals drawn using a non - homogeneous poisson process .",
    "it turns out that this idea has already been proposed in a remarkable work by mandelbrot in early seventies @xcite .",
    "mandelbrot precisely raised the problem of a generalization of the middle - third cantor set as we did in previous section and introduced the notion of `` random cutouts '' .",
    "in doing so , he introduced the analog on the real line of a similar `` cutout '' problem considered by dvoretzky @xcite on the circle .",
    "mandelbrot studied the general case when the poisson proceses in the @xmath66 plane is non - homogeneous along the scale direction and characterized by some intensity @xmath79 .",
    "he notably studied some conditions on @xmath79 under which one has @xmath80 .",
    "this problem was solved by shepp @xcite that proved that , with probability one , @xmath78 is non - empty if and only if @xmath81 while it is empty with probability one if this condition fails .    according to the considerations of the previous section ,",
    "let us introduce a non - homogeneous poisson process in the plane @xmath66 which intensity @xmath82 for @xmath83 and reads , for @xmath84 , @xmath85\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath86 is such that @xmath87 , @xmath88 is a large scale cut - off parameter ( the `` integral scale '' ) and @xmath89 stands for the dirac function .",
    "let us note that bounding the range of @xmath55 to @xmath84 and adding this dirac term is equivalent to consider that @xmath90 for all @xmath91 and to associate with each @xmath55 an intervall of size @xmath92 , as in eq . .",
    "this trick allows one , as we will see below , to preserve exact self - similarity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath17 are the events of such a poisson process , a self - similar mandelbrot cutout @xmath93 of parameter @xmath86 is defined as : @xmath94    using the above shepp criterion , one can easily see that this set is non - empty with probability one .",
    "indeed , from eq . , the integral simply becomes : @xmath95 which is always finite if @xmath96 .",
    "one can even get a stronger result and show that , with probability one , @xmath86 is the hausdorff dimension of @xmath93 .",

    "in that respect , since the average number of voids of size greater than @xmath111 is proportional to @xmath134 , @xmath135 can be interpreted as the probability that a void chosen at random among all voids of size greater than @xmath136 , has a size larger than @xmath111 .",
