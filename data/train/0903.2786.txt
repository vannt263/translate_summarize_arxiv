    "one of the major endeavors in modern physics is the quest to isolate the underlying physics in a given system against the background of irrelevant complexity .",
    "arguably , this challenge is tied into the ability to investigate systematically the predictions of a given theoretical hamiltonian model . separating model features from artifacts of the theoretical approximations involved ,",
    "represents the key to the quantitative understanding of the physics of strongly - interacting systems .",
    "unfortunately , first - principles calculations are presently possible only for small systems .    to achieve predictive power in many - body theory , it is important to develop a theoretical framework that can provide a systematic way of improving over mean - field theory and to demonstrate conclusively the numerical convergence of the results with the order of the approximation . for strongly - interacting systems of particles , traditional perturbation theory fails to converge fast enough for practical purposes .",
    "hence , the desired nonperturbative character of the theoretical framework to be employed . in this context",
    ", we submit that the coupled - cluster expansion approach to solving the many - body schrdinger equation represents the best hope of extending present state - of - the - art first - principles calculations to the realm of systems with large number of particles .",
    "it is also important to identify problems involving strongly - interacting systems of particles that can provide the test bed for many - body theoretical approaches and approximations .",
    "one such system is the infinite ( matter - like ) many - body system composed of spin-1/2 fermions interacting via a zero - range , infinite scattering length contact interaction . the problem of finding the ground - state properties of this system is referred to sometimes as the `` george bertsch problem ''  @xcite and is of particular interest in astrophysics in connection with the equation of state for neutron matter .",
    "this problem has been revisited recently with the advent of experimental studies in ultracold fermionic atom gases of the crossover from the regime of bardeen - schriffer - cooper ( bcs ) weakly - bound cooper pairs to the regime of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of diatomic molecules  @xcite .",
    "the `` bertsch problem '' was originally intended as a _ challenge _ parameter - free model of neutron matter at subnuclear density . in cold atom physics",
    ", the regime of interest is known as the `` unitarity limit ''  @xcite , i.e. the limit near feshbach resonances where the s - wave scattering length , @xmath0 , of two atoms with different spin components is much larger than the inter - particle distance ( @xmath1 ) . here , @xmath2 denotes the fermi momentum of the gas , which is conventionally related to the total density of particles , @xmath3 , by the noninteracting fermi gas formula @xmath4 where the momentum integral is performed over the interior volume of the fermi sphere , and @xmath5 denotes the spin component of the fermion , i.e. @xmath6 .    the  unitarity limit \" corresponds to the bcs to bec crossover in dilute ultracold fermionic atom gases and can be reached by modifying either the s - wave scattering length or the system density . for an interaction - induced crossover , the unitarity limit corresponds to the singularity in the scattering length and the limit is the same when approached with positive or negative scattering length . in this limit ,",
    "the correlations are deemed to be significant and the system is expected to exhibit universal behavior , independent of the shape of the potential and dependent only on the particle density .",
    "the importance of correlations in the ground state of dilute fermionic matter in the unitarity limit is measured by the numerical value of the ratio @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the ground - state energy densities of the interacting and noninteracting systems , respectively . a close upper - bound to the value of @xmath10",
    "was set by the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) study performed by carlson _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , which gave the value @xmath11 . in contrast , the `` universal '' curve describing the bcs to bec crossover in the standard bcs variational picture  @xcite derived by leggett  @xcite gives the mean - field numerical value @xmath12 , which suggests that beyond - to - leading order effects are responsible for a change of about 25% when compared to the mean - field solution .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental values for @xmath10 are summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will argue that by applying the coupled - cluster expansion ( cce )  @xcite formalism to the bertsch problem , we can demonstrate conclusively that the resulting cce equations are consistent with expectations based on purely heuristic arguments , such as universality and the possibility of a gap in the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "excitation spectrum .",
    "the latter is important for the ability to capture the superfluid properties of the system , if present .",
    "we will show that in the combined unitarity and zero - density limit , the ratio @xmath10 depends on only one parameter which in turn may depend only on the spatial dimensionality of the system .",
    "we will review now the basics of the cce approach : consider the many - body schrdinger equation , @xmath13 , with a two - body hamiltonian _ density _ operator , @xmath14 .    in second quantization , operators are expressed in terms of the creation and annihilation operators in momentum representation , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , subject to the canonical relations : @xmath17 where spin ( and isospin ) degrees of freedom are implied .",

    "gives the expression for the ground - state energy density , which , in the case of a two - body hamiltonian , i.e. if @xmath38 , includes at most contributions due to 2@xmath272@xmath28-correlations .",
    "for @xmath39 eq .",
    "gives rise to a system of nonlinear equations that must be solved self - consistently for the amplitudes @xmath32 in @xmath26 . in the case of an infinite system ,",
    "the equation corresponding to @xmath40 is identically zero because @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , approximations to the cce system of nonlinear equations are based on the idea that the @xmath42 amplitudes are small as long as the relative distance between particles is much larger than their average distance .",
    "hence , approximations such as @xmath43 for @xmath44 , are equivalent to truncating an expansion in powers of density  @xcite .",
