    "( 1988a , b ) , the formation of lirgs , or ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) is due to the interaction and merging of two gas - rich galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations of interacting galaxies @xcite indicate that a stable bar is formed during the first encounter . under the gravitational torque induced by the bar ,",
    "the molecular gas is channelled into the central regions of the galaxies forming a huge reservoir to fuel intense starbursts .",
    "recent high angular resolution observations @xcite seem to support this picture by revealing rotating disks of molecular gas that has been driven into the centers of the mergers .",
    "a lot of ( u)lirgs have been studied at high angular resolution , for example arp  299 @xcite , ngc5394/95 @xcite , arp  220 @xcite , ngc4038/39 @xcite , ngc5194/95 @xcite , ngc  6090 @xcite , ngc5218 @xcite .",
    "a few samples of the sources along the merging sequence are also been investigated .",
    "@xcite found evidence for an increase in 100- to 850-@xmath2 m flux density ratio along the merging sequence and interpreted this trend as an increase of the mass fraction of the warm dust in comparison to the cold dust , inferring the possible enhanced star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "@xcite , however , question the ubiquitous connection between interactions and starburst activity .",
    "@xcite find the enhanced star formation efficiency ( sfe ) for the later merging systems , but the effect is cancelled by the decrease in the amount of molecular gas . that might result in no change in the infrared luminosity , i.e. the indicator of the starburst activity .",
    "thus more sources in high resolution are needed and multiple co transtions are essential to investigate the gas properties for the mergers at different stages .    here",
    "we present another case study of an early merger system , arp  302 .",
    "this galaxy is also named as vv 340 or ugc 9618 , which consists of two galaxies ( arp  302n and arp  302s ) with a separation of about 40@xmath16 between the two nuclei , which is @xmath1727 kpc at the angular distance of 138 mpc ( the luminosity distance is 147 mpc ) , and has an infrared luminosity of 4.5@xmath710@xmath10 l@xmath18 .",
    "arp  302 is the most co luminous system known in the local universe , and more luminous in co than those ultraluminous galaxies out to redshifts of 0.27 ( solomon et al .",
    "the detected molecular gas mass is 9.1@xmath710@xmath19 m@xmath18 @xcite ( corrected by the adopted comsmology here ) .",
    "hi data gives a mass of atomic hydrogen 2.7@xmath710@xmath19 m@xmath18 @xcite . in all observations",
    "it was found that arp  302n contributes most of the ir emission and molecular gas mass .",
    "previous high resolution co @xmath0=1@xmath10 observation on arp  302 by @xcite ( the angular resolution is 7@xmath16@xmath75@xmath16 ) reveals two extended co disks ( @xmath20 10 kpc ) , and arp  302n shows roughly an exponential disk with a scale length of 7 kpc extending out to 23 kpc in diameter . based on the unusually extended distribution of the molecular gas",
    ", @xcite concluded that the high ir luminosity in arp  302 arises simply because an extremely large amount of molecular gas is forming high - mass stars at a rate similar to the galaxy , instead of the starburst activities in the galactic nucleus .    in this study , we report the high angular resolution co @xmath0=2@xmath11 observation of arp  302n and the analysis of archival data in the radio and mid / far infrared to study the physical properties of the gas as well as the star formation activities in this early merger . in  [ observations ] , we show the details of our observations together with the information about the archive data used in this paper . in  [ spatial ] ,",

    "the single sideband system temperature is about 450 k. because of the large extent of arp  302n , we cover the whole galaxy using a two - pointing mosaic , with a separation of 20@xmath16 between the two pointings located at 10@xmath16 north and south of the nucleus ( @xmath27=14@xmath2857@xmath2900@xmath30.67 , @xmath31=+24@xmath3237@xmath3302@xmath16.8 ) .",

    "a single pointing observation was made toward the nucleus of arp  302n .",

    "we only use the 8.0 @xmath2 m and the mips data in this paper .",
    "the uncertainties on the final absolute calibrations are estimated at 10% , 10% , 20% , and 20% for the 8 , 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath2 m data , respectively .",
    "in figure  [ channel_map ] we show the channel maps of co @xmath0=2@xmath11 emission for arp  302n .",
    "there is a clear positional shift of the emission centroid with the velocity along the north - south direction , consistent with the rotation of the gas in the galactic disk . in each velocity channel",
    "we find that the emission is just barely resolved in the east - west direction , which is perpendicular to the galactic plane . in the channels with the velocity within 80 ,",
    "the emission is compact and only slightly resolved by the sma , showing a symmetric distribution .",
    "the emission in this velocity range is centered at the nucleus and the emission of some channels is weaker than the channels outside this range . in higher",
    "redshifted and blueshifted velocity channels the emission is slightly more extended in the north - south direction , especially for the channels above 220 . for the receding part of the galaxy the co j=21 emission is resolved into two distinct components , which are separated by about 8@xmath16 .    because the total extent of the co emission is significant by comparison with the primary beam of the sma , part of the co flux could be resolved out in our sma observations . in figure  [ spectra ]",
    "we compare the spectrum of co j=21 obtained with the smt at the resolution of 28@xmath16 and that obtained by convolving our sma channel maps to the same resolution .",
    "the co @xmath0=2@xmath11 flux detected by the sma within one smt beam centered at the nucleus is 356(@xmath368 ) jy km  s@xmath23 .",
    "it suggests that the sma recovers about 60% of the co @xmath0=2@xmath11 flux from arp 302 in comparison with a total flux of 576 jy detected by the smt . the total co @xmath0=2@xmath11 flux detected by",
    "the sma is 382 ( @xmath3610 ) jy km  s@xmath23 .",
    "the most significant difference between both spectrum is the comparatively lower emission in the sma spectrum from 220 to 320 , which could be due to extended emission that is partially resolved out by the sma in the outer northern region .",
    "the similarity in the line shape between single dish and the sma spectrum suggests that the missing flux is more or less uniformly distributed across the line .",
    "figure  [ arp302_color](b ) shows the contours of integrated co @xmath0=2@xmath11 intensity map at 3.4@xmath16@xmath72.5@xmath16 resolution by the sma .",
    "the molecular gas almost covers the entire optical disk of the galaxy seen almost edge on and distributes over a region with the size of about 15 kpc .",
    "we find that the molecular gas has a very asymmetric distribution with two strong concentrations on either side of center together with a outmost weaker concentration offset by about 8 kpc to the north . in the figure ,",
    "we show three crosses from bottom to top : one is at the nucleus , the second is at the peak of 3.6 cm emission outside of the nucleus ( see  [ vla ] ) and the third one is at the outmost north for the weak co j=21 emission concentration . to compare with the bima data , we show the bima co @xmath0=1@xmath10 map in figure  [ arp302_color](a ) .",
    "our higher resolution map allows us to investigate the molecular gas distribution with three concentrations along the north - south direction , which the bima data can not tell us .",
    "we also convolved the sma beam to the bima s and the map is shown in figure  [ arp302_color](d ) .",
    "the bima map shows more extended distribution of the gas with large radial distance comparison with the sma result , which may be due to the different exciation conditions for the gas at large radial distance .      in figure  [ arp302_color](e ) , we present the map of the brightness temperature ratio of co @xmath0=2@xmath11 emission from the sma to co @xmath0=1@xmath10 emission from the bima .",
    "to calculate the line ration , we first convolve our co @xmath0=2@xmath11 map to the same angular resolution of 7@xmath16@xmath75@xmath16 of the bima data as shown in figure  [ arp302_color](d ) and form the line ratio map .",
    "we find that the line ratio varies from 0.2 at the outer region to about 0.5 at the peaks .",
    "the ratio should be the lower limit since the missing flux of the sma is about 36% but there is no missing flux for the bima data  the flux of 304@xmath3645 jy km  s@xmath23 from the bima co @xmath0=1@xmath10 observation @xcite is similar to the value of 290@xmath3635 jy km  s@xmath23 from nrao 12 m telescope ( private communication from y. gao ; gao & solomon 1999 ) .",
    "the line ratio is a very important observational constraint to estimate the physical conditions of the molecular gas in arp  302n as we will show in the next section .",
    "we present in figure  [ arp302_color](c ) the intensity - weighted velocity field as contours . a velocity field typical of normal rotation",
    "is clearly seen along the major axis within a radius of @xmath174@xmath16 , i.e. 2.7  kpc . along the minor axis , we can not detect any disturblance of the gas in the inner region . in figure  [ velplot ]",
    "we shows the position - velocity ( pv ) diagram of the co j=21 emission along the major axis ( position angle of 1@xmath37 ) .",
    "we note that the molecular gas exhibits a nearly constant velocity gradient ( about 100 km  s@xmath23 kpc@xmath23 ) within the central 6@xmath16 or 4.0 kpc in linear scale . in the velocity range between 260 and 340 km",
    "s@xmath23 there are clearly two components : one is associated with the gas at arp302n - cm and the other component located to the northern part about 8@xmath16 to 15@xmath16 away from the nucleus .",
    "the gas at 3.3@xmath16 ( 2.2 kpc ) north of the nucleus shows a slightly steeper velocity gradient ( about 170 km  s@xmath23 kpc@xmath23 ) and the position of this feature is consistent with arp302n - cm ( the secondary 3.6 cm radio emission feature , see  [ vla ] ) .",
    "the molecular gas located at large galactocentric distance toward the north shows clear deviation from solid body rotation , as can be seen in figure  [ velplot ] .",
    "@xcite find that there is a steep rise in rotation velocity , i.e. the velocity gradient @xmath17 1000 km s@xmath23 kpc@xmath23 , in the central regions with radii of typically @xmath14 0.5 kpc towards most nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "it is therefore apparent that the presence of a shallow velocity gradient over an extended region of 4.0 kpc in radius sets arp  302n apart from normal cases .",
    "however , solid body rotation over kpc - scales is found in some special cases , such as ngc  4194 @xcite , ngc  7479 @xcite , ugc  2866 @xcite and ngc  891 @xcite .",
    "usually the presence of a molecular ring or the solid body rotation in bars are evoked to explain the observed linear velocity gradient .",
    "low resolution of the images at c band ( 6  cm ) and l band ( 20  cm ) , as shown in figure  [ arp302_vla ] , indicate that the radio emission is concentrated in the central region .",
    "there is only one central peak and the details can not be well resolved with the current poor resolutions , which are 1314@xmath16 for both observations .",
    "the integrated intensities are 30.2@xmath360.4 mjy and 89.0@xmath363.6 mjy for 6  cm and 20  cm respectively , yielding a spectral index , @xmath27 ( where s @xmath38 @xmath39 ) , of 0.9 .",
    "high resolution of the x band ( 3.6  cm ) images are shown in figure  [ arp302_vla ] . 3.6 cm continuum emission is mainly contributed from two components with similar total integrated intensity .",
    "one component , associated with the galactic nucleus , is compact and marginally resolved ( right top panel of figure  [ arp302_vla ] ) .",
    "a second component is located at 3.3@xmath16 ( @xmath17 2.2 kpc ) north of the nucleus ( arp302n - cm hereafter ) and extends from 2@xmath16 to 4@xmath16 away from the nucleus ( left top panel of figure  [ arp302_vla ] ) .",
    "all the results are summarized in table  [ xband ] .      in figure  [ irac ]",
    "we show the mid infrared continuum emision from arp  302 at 8.0 @xmath2 m and 24 @xmath2 m taken with irac and mips instruments of spitzer .",
    "both 8.0 @xmath2 m and 24 @xmath2 m images exhibit similar morphology to that seen in the co j=21 emission .",
    "hot dust traced by the 8.0 @xmath2 m and 24 @xmath2 m share the similar spatial distribution as the molecular gas traced by the co j=21 emission . with a resolution of @xmath177@xmath16 at 24 @xmath2 m , arp  302 is very well resolved . from the mips image",

    "an additional cold gas component with a dust mass of 1.62.5@xmath710@xmath8 m@xmath18 and a dust temperature of 20 - 15  k can conpensate for the lower predicted flux at 850  @xmath2 m .",

    "this places arp  302 to be the most co luminous system known in the local universe and possibly the most gas rich system .",
    "usually , we can estimate the gas mass using a standard conversion factor , 4.8  m@xmath18 ( k  pc@xmath60)@xmath23 in our galaxy , and it leads to a gas mass of 7.7@xmath710@xmath19m@xmath18 .",

    "we estimate the dust temperature in the range of 26 to 36 k. for the excitation calculation , we adopt two representative values of 20 and 30 k. in figure  [ lvg ] ( left panel ) we present the dependence of co @xmath0=2@xmath11/@xmath0=1@xmath10 line ratio on the gas density @xmath62 and the abundance per velocity gradient [ co]/@xmath63 for kinetic temperature of 20 and 30  k. the figure shows that for the line ratio measured in arp  302n the gas density is low , less than 10@xmath3 @xmath4 . at this low density ,",
    "the transition @xmath0=2@xmath11 is sub - thermally excited .",
    "lower line ratios correspond to lower densities for a reasonable range of abundance per velocity gradient .",
    "to provide further support for this conclusion we also show the dependence of line ratio on the gas density and kinetic temperature t@xmath64 for a fixed abundance per velocity gradient of [ co]/@xmath63 = 1@xmath7 10@xmath65 pc  ( @xmath66)@xmath23 ( right panel of figure  [ lvg ] ) .",
    "the result suggests only a weak dependence on kinetic temperature .",
    "our finding is very similar to the conclusion of @xcite in that the variation in line ratio mainly reflects the variation in gas density . to set more stringent limits on the gas density and temperature",
    "would require observations of higher transitions of co and/or its @xmath67co isotope .",
    "the relatively low gas density in arp  302n is reflected in its spatial distribution .",
    "for ulirgs , which are in a more advanced merger phase , @xcite show that the molecular gas is more strongly concentrated in the nuclear region of the galaxy in the form of a rotating disk with size of 1 kpc or less .",
    "the estimated average gas density is higher , ranging from a few 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath68 @xmath4 . in arp",
    "302n , there is a large amount of molecular gas ( 5.4@xmath710@xmath19 m@xmath69 , see in  [ dust ] ) , but this gas is distributed over a very extended galactic disk with a size of 15 kpc , resulting in lower average density .",
    "we note that the diffuse and very extended spatial distribution of molecular gas in arp  302n is unusual among local luminous and ultralumious galaxies .",
    "however , in some cases such as in the interacting galaxy m51 , the molecular gas traced by co emission also covers all the optical disk , out to at least 12 kpc radius @xcite .",
    "the origin of this distribution is currently unknown .",
    "the star formation activity can be estimated by sfe , the ratio of luminosity to molecular gas mass , of the galaxies . for arp  302n",
    ", we estimate an infrared luminosity of 3.4@xmath710@xmath10 l@xmath69 , separating the contamination of arp  302s in the manner described in  [ spitzer ] .",
    "we can also estimate the infrared luminosity from the 24 @xmath2 m data with the empirical formula l@xmath70=10@xmath71 @xcite , yielding a luminosity of 2.7 @xmath710@xmath10 l@xmath69 , which is comparable with our estimated iras luminosity .",
    "the molecular gas estimate is 5.4@xmath710@xmath19 m@xmath69 for arp  302n .",
    "its sfe of 6.3 l@xmath69/m@xmath69 is slightly higher than that in our galaxy but much lower than starburst galaxies or ( u)lirgs . the high infrared luminosity , the large amount of the gas mass and the low sfe make this galaxy peculiar .",
    "the sfr for arp  302n is about 40 @xmath72 assuming sfr = 1.17@xmath710@xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) @xmath75",
    "yr@xmath23 @xcite , and thus arp  302n can retain such a luminosity over a period of at most 2.0@xmath76 yrs .",
    "the system will likely evolve into advanced merger in a timescale of several tens million yrs @xcite , and may at that time become a ulirg with a luminosity of 1.6@xmath710@xmath15 @xmath77 even if it will lose half of its gas mass by then ( given a sfe of 42 l@xmath69/m@xmath69 for the merging systems with the separation less than 5 kpc from gao & solomon 1999 ) .",
    "as discussed in previous section , our excitation analysis suggests that the low line ratio in arp  302n is due to the low volume density of the molecular gas .",
    "the low gas density is entirely consistent with the low sfe observed in arp  302n , as star formation is associated with dense gas rather than just total gas mass @xcite .",
    "the thermal radio emission from hii regions is identifiable by its flat spectral index with a typical value of 0.1 .",
    "a spectral index of 0.9 as measured for arp  302n implied that non - thermal emission dominates .",
    "synchrotron emission with a spectral index of 0.9 is likely to be dominated by supernova remnants with small diameters , referred to the star forming activity in arp  302n . from the high resolution images at 3.6  cm",
    ", the continuum emission mainly comes from the nucleus and arp302n - cm .",
    "therefore , the nucleus and arp302n - cm are the regions with strong star forming activity .",
    "the extended infrared emission from spitzer 8 and 24 @xmath2 m data excludes the existence of a strong agn in arp  302n and favors the star formation origin for the large infrared luminosity in arp  302n .",
    "therefore it fully supports that the star formation dominates the ir emission in the galgaxy .",
    "the 3.6 cm observation shows that there is strong and extended radio continuum emission at arp302n - cm .",
    "the spitzer 8 and 24 @xmath2 m images peak at the same region , indicating that there is strong emission from the pah and hot dust .",
    "the high resolution co @xmath0=2@xmath11 image from the sma reveals much molecular gas exists at arp302n - cm .",
    "all of these results support that there is the asymmetrical star forming activities in the system and arp302n - cm is the strongest active star forming region in the galaxy .    from 3.6  cm images with the different resolutions at the nuclear region ,",
    "it is clear that at least 36% of the emission is not associated with the unresolved structure in the nuclear region and 64% of the emission is originated from a compact region ( from the vla 3.6  cm data , the deconvolved size is 0.23@xmath16@xmath70.09@xmath16 , i.e. 143 pc @xmath7 56 pc ) . as a whole , the star formation is not active in arp  302n , but there is strong star forming regions at the nucleus and arp302n - cm .    from the previous optical spectroscopy observation @xcite , the system was classified as liner type galaxy .",
    "@xcite claim that liner - like optical spectra would be the consequence of the shock - heating by supernovae of the surrounding gas after a burst of star formation , as observed in ngc  5218 @xcite .",
    "this scenario to explain the liner type spectrum is consistent with our radio observation which suggests that there are many supernova explosions .",
    "of course , we can not exclude the possible existence of a weak agn in the center .      in arp 302n the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas show no discernable disturbance .",
    "that suggests the arp 302 system is in the early merging stage .",
    "recently , many authors studied the molecular gas in high angular resolution to investigate the effects of the merging procedure and the star formation therein .",
    "the molecular gas is often concentrated on the overlap region or at least have another peak except for the centers of the systems with the well seperated nuclei , such as arp  299 @xcite , ngc  6090 @xcite and vv  114 @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the starburst acitivites is prominent and the sfe is much higher than that in our galaxies .",
    "ngc  6670 is another widely seperated merger and is well studied by @xcite .",
    "they also found that the stars and the molecular gas do not show any clear sign of the merging process .",
    "however , the atomic gas is found to concentrate in the region in between the two galaxies , a very clear signature of the merging process .",
    "the atomic gas will be helpful to determine the merging process in arp  302 .",
    "indeed , simulations show that the high sfrs and the sfes arise only in the late stages of the merger and the star formation does not deplete much gas before it reaches the central regions in the mergering systems @xcite .",
    "it is consistent with the observed enhanced sfe in the late mergers by @xcite , which suggests that the fact before its final merging stage is the reason why the sfe in this lirg is just comparable to the value in our galaxy .",
    "the huge infrared luminosity in arp  302n is just due to its large amount of the gas mass instead of the starburst activity .",
    "in this paper we present the sma observations of the co @xmath0=2@xmath11 transition towards the northern galaxy , arp  302n , of the early merging system , arp  302 , to study the physical properties of the gas .",
    "to well understand the star formation activities , the vla data at 3.6  cm , 6.0  cm , 20  cm and the spitzer ( both irac and mips data ) archive data are also shown here .",
    "our main results are summarized as the following :    1 .",
    "our high angular resolution co @xmath0=2@xmath11 observation reveals the extended spatial distribution of the molecular gas in arp  302n .",
    "we find that the molecular gas has a very asymmetric distribution with two strong concentrations on either side of the center together with a weaker one offset by about 8 kpc to the north .",
    "this spatial distribution is very similar to the morphology seen previously in the co j=21 line . 2 .",
    "the distribution of the molecular gas is also found to be consistent with that for the pah and the hot dust as traced by the 8 @xmath2 m and 24 @xmath2 m continuum emission observed by spitzer .",
    "the line ratio co j=21/1 - 0 shows that the line ratio varies strongly from about 0.7 near the galaxy center to 0.4 in the outer part of the galaxy .",
    "excitation analysis suggests that the gas density is low , less than 10@xmath3 @xmath4 , over the entire galaxy .",
    "by fitting the far infrared part of the sed of arp  302n , we obtain a dust temperature @xmath5 in the range 2636 k and a dust mass of m@xmath6=2.03.6@xmath710@xmath8 m@xmath9 .",
    "we determine the spectral index of the radio continuum to be approximately 0.9 .",
    "the spatial distribution and spectral index of the radio continuum emission suggests that most of the radio continuum emission is synchrotron emission from the star forming regions at the nucleus and arp302n - cm .",
    "the good spatial correspondance between the 3.6 cm radio continuum emission , the spitzer 8 and 24 @xmath2 m data and the high resolution co @xmath0=2@xmath11 observation from the sma shows that there is the asymmetrical star forming activities in arp  302n and arp302n - cm is the strongest active star forming region in the galaxy .",
