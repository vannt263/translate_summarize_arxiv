    "the impressive performance of the asymmetric b - factories at kek and slac in the @xmath3 region and the large integrated luminosities ( @xmath4 ) the corresponding detectors , belle and babar , are projected to collect in the next few years renders additional contributions to b - meson physics by cleo problematic .",
    "correspondingly , cleo seeks to exploit its extensive experience in heavy flavor physics and the excellent performance of its nearly hermetic detector to perform focused studies of charm and qcd physics in the energy range @xmath5gev .",
    "indeed , cleo no longer runs at @xmath6 but began a year long program in november 2001 to run at @xmath7 and to collect @xmath8 at each resonance .",
    "this data set is a factor of @xmath9 larger than the existing world data set of similar type and will provide @xmath10 measurements of leptonic widths and precise measurements of a wide range of precision branching fractions to complement the proposed qcd studies@xcite .",
    "the cleo - c proposal@xcite entails a 3-year run plan at `` charm production '' threshold : running at @xmath11 ( @xmath12 threshold ) in 2003 and collecting @xmath13 ; running in 2004 at @xmath14mev ( @xmath15 threshold ) and collecting @xmath13 ; and running in 2005 at @xmath16 and collecting @xmath17 .",
    "these integrated luminosities represent data sets that are a factor of @xmath18 larger than corresponding data sets of bes  ii and mark  iii .",
    "a focussed set of precision measurements of charm absolute branching fractions and spectroscopy of @xmath19 quarkonia is the core of the cleo - c physics program .",
    "the physics reach has been carefully simulated using analysis tools and detector understanding acquired by the cleo collaboration from many years of heavy quark studies .",
    "measurement of @xmath20 and @xmath21 leptonic decays permit determinations of the decays constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "measurements of semileptonic decays will yield precision determinations of semileptonic form factors and the ckm matrix elements @xmath24 and @xmath25 and so provide a check of the unitarity of the matrix itself .",
    "semileptonic form factors can also be accurately determined .",
    "precise charm absolute branching fractions will normalize important @xmath26 decay measurements and provide a robust means of verifying and calibrating theoretical techniques of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and lattice gauge theory that can in turn be applied to the @xmath27 sector to improve measurements of ckm matrix elements @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "high statistics samples of @xmath19 data ( as well as @xmath30 data from the @xmath31 runs now underway ) will permit efficient searches for purely gluonic `` glueballs '' and quark - gluon `` hybrids '' in the mass range @xmath32 .",
    "the existence of such exotic states is an unambiguous prediction of qcd and the unambiguous detection of such states is of fundamental importance .",
    "determination of the @xmath33 quantum numbers through partial wave analysis , as well as measurements of decay widths and branching fractions of putative exotic states , will clarify the gluonic content of exotic candidates . additionally , cleo - c will have sensitivity to physics beyond the standard model by mounting searches for @xmath12-mixing , @xmath34 violation in the charm sector , and searches for a host of rare @xmath20 and @xmath35 decays .",
    "minimal modifications to cesr are required to implement the lower energy running in the range @xmath5gev .",
    "supplemental radiation damping will be induced to produce transverse cooling by the insertion of 18 meters of @xmath36 t wiggler magnets so that the luminosity scales as @xmath37 rather than the naive @xmath38 expectation .",

    "prototype wiggler design and construction are well advanced .",
    "cleo - c will not be able to compete against the asymmetric @xmath26 factory detectors running at @xmath43 in the raw number of charm events collected .",
    "however , running at charm threshold production has distinct advantages over continuum @xmath44 production .",
    "for example , the charged and neutral multiplicities in @xmath45 events are only 5.0 and 2.4 , respectively , reducing combinatorics and leading to high detection efficiencies and low systematic errors . additionally , charm events at threshold are pure @xmath12 , including the @xmath46 decaying into @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "no additional particles from fragmentation are produced .",
    "low multiplicity events and pure @xmath12 states , coupled with the relatively high branching fractions typical of @xmath20 decays , permit the efficient implementation of `` double tag '' studies where one @xmath20 is fully reconstructed and the other is studied in a bias free fashion .",
    "this permits the determination of absolute branching fractions with very low backgrounds . in leptonic and semileptonic",
    "decays , the missing neutrino can be treated as a missing mass problem , with a missing mass resolution better than one pion mass .",
    "finally , the quantum coherence of the @xmath12 states produced in @xmath50 and @xmath51 decays permit relatively simple techniques@xcite for measuring @xmath12 mixing parameters and direct @xmath34 violation .",
    "the combination of pure @xmath52 at @xmath11 ( @xmath53 , typical charm branching fractions of @xmath54 , and a high reconstruction efficiency for @xmath20-mesons , lead to a high net @xmath20-meson tagging efficiency of @xmath55 for cleo - c .",

    "the technique for tagging a single @xmath20 candidate can of course be extended to the second @xmath20-meson candidate in @xmath44 threshold production events by essentially applying the single - tag technique twice .",
    "some additional constraints on the flavor - defining charge of the second @xmath20 candidate , overall event topology , and overall event energy and invariant mass are applied to produce `` double - tag '' @xmath20 candidates . using a modified version of a technique developed at mark",
