    "in recent years , the study of quantum models with multiple competing ground states has emerged as an important theme in the study of strongly - correlated many - body quantum systems .",
    "for example , in the cuprates it is clear that states with density - wave order at a variety of wavevectors play an important role in the physics at low carrier concentrations .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a simple one - dimensional quantum model which displays a multiplicity of ground states . despite its simplicity ,",
    "it exhibits ( _ i _ ) gapped states with commensurate density - wave order ( with periods of 2 and 3 lattice spacings ) , ( _ ii _ ) gapless regions with `` floating '' incommensurate , quasi - long - range density - wave correlations , and ( _ iii _ ) gapped states which preserve translational symmetry .",
    "a special case of our model appeared in a recent study @xcite of atoms trapped in optical lattices @xcite , and so an experimental study of the phase diagram presented here may be feasible . more generally , we offer our model as a simple laboratory , with many exactly solvable cases , for the interplay of density - wave orders with multiple periods in quantum systems .",
    "our model is expressed in terms of the bose operator @xmath0 , which annihilates a boson on site @xmath1 , and the boson number operator @xmath2 the `` hard '' boson condition allows no more than 1 boson on any pair of nearest - neighbor sites , and hence all states obey the constraints @xmath3 in the study of mott insulators in optical lattices @xcite , the @xmath0 boson represents a _ dipole _",
    "excitation , consisting of a particle - hole pair bound on nearest neighbor sites of the optical lattice .",
    "this microscopic dipole interpretation will not be crucial to our analysis here , and so we will refer to @xmath0 simply as a boson .",
    "the boson hamiltonian we study is @xmath4 \\label{h } \\label{ham}\\ ] ] note that the total number of bosons is not conserved , and it is possible to create and annihilate bosons out of the vacuum .",
    "this is natural in the dipole interpretation of the boson , as a particle - hole pair can be created or annihilated from the background mott insulator .",
    "there is also no explicit boson hopping term ; as was shown in ref .",
    ", boson hopping is generated by the combination of the constraints in ( [ constraints ] ) and single - site terms already in @xmath5 , and so it is not necessary to include an explicit hopping .",
    "@xmath6 is a chemical potential for the bosons , while @xmath7 is a `` nearest''-neighbor interaction , `` nearest '' meaning two sites apart , the closest two bosons can come .",
    "one can of course rescale out one of the couplings to obtain a two - parameter hamiltonian , but it will be convenient to keep all three .",
    "the case @xmath8 of @xmath5 was studied in ref .  ; we have also streamlined the earlier notation of the coupling constants to a form suitable for our analysis here . without the constraints ( [ constraints ] )",
    ", the hamiltonian would be trivially solvable . with them ,",
    "its analysis becomes quite intricate .",
    "the ground state of our hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can exhibit several kinds of order , depending on the couplings .",
    "the hamiltonian will favor having bosons on every other site if we have an attractive `` nearest''-neighbor interaction , or a chemical potential favoring the creation of particles .",
    "we will show that this leads to a regime of ising - type order , with a spontaneously broken @xmath9 symmetry , translation by one site .",
    "if the chemical potential still favors creating particles , but there is a repulsive `` nearest '' neighbor potential , then the ground state will favor having a particle on every third site .",
    "this sort of order breaks a @xmath10 symmetry , translation by one or two sites .",
    "when the the two kinds of ordered states have nearly the same energies , we will show that there exists an incommensurate phase . in the incommensurate phase , bosons appear on every other or every third site .",
    "the one - dimensional quantum hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) looks unusual because of the single - particle creation and annihilation operators .",
    "however , it in fact has already appeared in a very different context : it arises from taking the ( euclidean ) time continuum limit of a two - dimensional classical statistical - mechanical model , the hard - square model @xcite .",
    "this model describes the statistical mechanics of square tiles placed on the sites of a square lattice .",
    "each square tile is rotated by 45@xmath11 from the principal axes of the square lattice , and the area of each tile is twice the area of a single plaquette of the lattice .",
    "tiles are not allowed to overlap , so this means nearest - neighbor sites can not both be occupied : putting a tile on every other site of the square lattice covers all of space .",
    "it is easy to see that the hilbert space of our one - dimensional quantum theory is identical to the space of states along a line of the hard - square model . in the quantum theory ,",
    "the hilbert space consists of bosons which are restricted one to a site and forbidden to be nearest neighbors . in the two - dimensional classical theory , the squares appear at most one to a site , and are forbidden to be nearest neighbors .",
    "it is less obvious that one can obtain the quantum hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) by taking a limit of the classical transfer matrix .",
    "we show in the appendix how to do this , by taking the ( euclidean ) time direction to be along the diagonals of the square lattice . roughly speaking",
    ", the chemical potential @xmath6 and interaction @xmath7 correspond to a chemical potential and interaction strength for the squares .",
    "the precise relations are derived in the appendix .",
    "the phase diagram of the hard - square model has been studied in ref .  .",
    "we will explain in section ii how these results apply to the ground state of our quantum hamiltonian .",
    "an extremely useful result is that the hard - square model is integrable for some values of the boltzmann weights @xcite . in terms of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , this amounts to two lines in our two - parameter space of couplings : @xmath12 there is a single critical point along each of these lines ; they are in the universality classes of the ising tricritical point and of the three - state potts model critical point",
    ". we will show how these critical points describe transitions to and from the @xmath9 and @xmath13 ordered phases .    in section [ sec : phase ]",
    "we discuss the different regions of phase space . in section [ sec : potts ] we discuss in depth the phase with order of period 3 , the phase with spontaneously - broken @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "we present numerical results to support the analytic arguments . in sections [ sec : float ] and",
    "[ sec : bethe ] , we discuss the incommensurate `` floating '' phase in depth .",
    "in section [ sec : float ] we derive an effective hamiltonian for this region , and prove that an incommensurate phase exists by bosonizing it . in section [ sec : bethe ]",
    "we calculate the size of this phase by using the bethe ansatz to compute the effective luttinger parameter exactly .",
    "this enables us to find the region in which vortex - type perturbations are irrelevant and do not destroy the incommensurability .",
    "unfortunately , this region occupies a fairly small region of parameter space , so it is not possible to see this result numerically .",
    "our main results are summarized in the phase diagram shown in fig  [ phase ] .     as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "schematic representations of the ground states with density waves of period 2 and 3 are shown .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the positions of the integrable lines in ( [ intlines ] ) .",
    "the critical points along these lines ( [ so],[crit ] ) are labeled @xmath16 .",
    "the extent of the incommensurate region has been greatly exaggerated for clarity : it is drawn to scale in fig  [ phase2 ] .",
    "there could also be an incommensurate region adjacent to the chiral transition line about @xmath17 , but we have no direct evidence for this possibility.,width=307 ]    we discuss the phases and phase transitions in this figure by considering a number of limiting cases .",
    "first we consider the case @xmath8 , which was studied earlier in ref .  .",
    "although the hamiltonian looks simple in this limit , the prohibition of nearest - neighbor bosons means that this case is not solvable except as @xmath18 . for large positive @xmath14",
    "we obtain a featureless ground state with a small density of bosons and which breaks no translational symmetry , as is easily seen from @xmath5 .",
    "this is a disordered , or liquid , phase .",
    "similarly , for @xmath14 large and negative , the energy is minimized by states with a maximal density of bosons : there are 2 degenerate states of this type , each with every second site occupied ; in other words , there is a density wave of period 2 , and translational symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "it was shown numerically in ref .   that there is a second - order ising critical point which separates these phases at @xmath19 .",
    "one can also find the location of the transition from ising order to disorder easily in the limit @xmath20 and @xmath21 . with @xmath22 and @xmath23 both large",
    ", we can ignore the @xmath24 term , and then @xmath5 becomes a model of classical particles .",
    "the empty state with no particles has energy 0 , while the maximally occupied states with density waves of period 2 have energy per lattice site of @xmath25 .",
    "there is therefore a first - order transition between these states at @xmath26 .",
    "actually , it is quite easy to find the position of this first - order transition to order @xmath27 .",
    "using standard second - order perturbation theory in @xmath24 , the energy per site of the empty state is @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , the energy per site of the maximally occupied state is @xmath29 . equating these two energies we estimate the position of the first - order transition to be @xmath30    the integrability of the model along the lines ( [ intlines ] ) lets us understand how this transition occurs at finite @xmath7 and @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , the condition ( [ fo ] ) coincides precisely with one of the integrable lines in ( [ intlines ] ) .",
    "indeed , the arguments of huse @xcite and the exact results @xcite imply that integrable line is precisely along the co - existence line of these two phases , and hence the first - order boundary is given exactly by ( [ fo ] ) , with no corrections at higher order in @xmath31 .    at the value",
    "@xmath32 there is a critical point along the integrable line .",
    "thus the first - order transition line must terminate .",
    "huse argued that this integrable quantum critical point was a tricritical point separating a first - order boundary from a line of second - order ising transitions .",
    "indeed , the computation of exact critical exponents at this point @xcite shows that this critical point in the hard - square model is in the same universality class as the tricritical point in the ising model .",
    "this tricritical point in the continuum limit is described by the minimal conformal field theory with central charge @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the line of first - order transitions determined by ( [ fo ] ) is present for @xmath34 , where it terminates at the ising tricritical point @xmath35 shown in fig  [ phase ] .",
    "there is a line of second - order ising transitions on the other side of @xmath35 , but this is _ not _ on the integrable line ( [ intlines ] ) ; this second - order line clearly passes through the point ( [ so ] ) discussed above .",
    "the exact computations show that the integrable line for @xmath36 is in the @xmath9 ordered phase @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the finite value ( [ so ] ) of @xmath37 for @xmath8 ; at @xmath8 the integrable line is at @xmath38 .",
    "consider the case @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the large positive value of @xmath7 now prohibits bosons separated by 2 lattice spacings , and hence we effectively have the constraint @xmath41 along with the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) .",
    "the physics in this region can be understood using reasoning parallel to that in section  [ sec : ising ] .",
    "as before , for large positive @xmath14 , we obtain a featureless ground state with a small density of bosons , which breaks no lattice symmetry . for @xmath14 large and negative",
    ", the ground state has a maximal density of bosons : with the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) _ and _ ( [ pconst ] ) there are now 3 degenerate states of this type , each with every third site occupied .",
    "here we thus have a density wave of period 3 .    to study this phase with spontaneously - broken @xmath13 symmetry at finite @xmath7 , we can use results for the other integrable line , where @xmath42 in ( [ fo ] ) .",
    "along this line there is a quantum critical point at @xcite @xmath43 this critical point is in the universality class of the three - state potts model @xcite . in the continuum limit",
    "this is described by the minimal conformal field theory with central charge @xmath44 @xcite . for @xmath31",
    "smaller than this value and along this line , the exact results indeed show that the @xmath13 translation symmetry is broken .",
    "for @xmath31 larger than this value and along this line , there is no order .",
    "thus along the integrable line , the transition is in the universality class of the usual order - disorder transition in the three - state potts model ; similar @xmath13 quantum criticality occurs in an xxz chain in a staggered field @xcite .",
    "however , as opposed to the ising case , the transition away from this integrable line is not of the usual type @xcite : it is related that of the chiral clock model @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the nature of the transition between these states as a function of @xmath14 in section [ sec : potts ] , including the possibility of additional intermediate states with incommensurate periods .",
    "the most complicated and interesting limit is @xmath39 , @xmath45 . where there is competition between density - wave orders of period 2 and period 3 .",
    "initially , as in section  [ sec : ising ] , we anticipate that with @xmath46 and @xmath47 both large , we can neglect quantum effects and consider a model of classical particles .",
    "the period-2 and period-3 density - wave states then have energies per site @xmath25 and @xmath48 respectively , so that the ground states become degenerate at @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath49 in this limit , there are many degenerate states : any state where successive particles are separated by either 2 or 3 lattice spacings is within the ground state manifold .",
    "this results in an extensive classical entropy at @xmath49 .",
    "this extensive degeneracy is lifted only by quantum effects , and perturbation theory in @xmath24 is therefore highly non - trivial .",
    "the analysis of quantum effects in this regime will be presented in sections [ sec : float ] and [ sec : bethe ] .",
    "we will establish that there is an intermediate gapless phase with incommensurate spin correlations .",
    "we will show as well that the gapped state with no broken symmetry also intervenes between the period-2 density - wave state and the incommensurate phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "we will argue in section [ sec : potts ] that there also should be an incommensurate phase near the potts critical point @xmath17 .",
    "the simplest and most plausible possibility is that this phase and the one for @xmath50 are the same .",
    "we have drawn the phase diagram in this fashion .",
    "the density - wave state of period 3 appears when @xmath7 is large and positive , so that bosons with separations of both 1 and 2 lattice spacings are suppressed .",
    "this section and the next will discuss the manner in which quantum fluctuations destroy this period-3 order .",
    "it is useful to begin with the limit @xmath39 , noted above in section  [ sec : vpotts ] . at first glance",
    ", there appear to be only two distinct possibilities for the ground states : a featureless , low density state at large positive @xmath14 , and a density - wave state of period 3 at large negative @xmath51 .",
    "we might also anticipate that these states are separated by a second - order critical point in the universality class of the 3-state potts model .",
    "however , the situation is more subtle @xcite .",
    "it is useful to introduce order parameters , @xmath52 , which characterize density - wave orders of period @xmath53 ( in general , @xmath53 need not be an integer ) : @xmath54 for @xmath55 , the ising order parameter @xmath56 is real .",
    "however , for the @xmath57 case we consider in this section , the potts order parameter @xmath58 is complex .",
    "clearly , the state with density wave order of period 3 has @xmath59 , while the featureless , low density state has @xmath60 .    using the usual symmetry criteria",
    ", we can write down a continuum quantum field theory describe the onset of potts order",
    ". the action should be invariant under translations , under which @xmath61 , with @xmath62 integer . a crucial point , noted by huse and fisher @xcite in a different context , is the behavior under spatial inversion : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the continuum spatial co - ordinate .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath58 is invariant under time reversal .",
    "these symmetry constraints lead to the following proposed effective action for the quantum field theory ( @xmath65 is imaginary time ) : @xmath66 \\label{schiral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the critical point associated with this field theory occurs at @xmath67 , and is in the same universality class as the critical point in the three - state potts model .",
    "this is described by a conformal field theory of central charge @xmath44 , and the dimensions of all the operators are known .",
    "the exact results show that the integrable critical point @xmath17 indeed is in the universality class of the three - state potts model @xcite .",
    "it separates a state with density - wave order of period 3 from the gapped translationally - invariant state @xcite . just because the critical point is in the same universality class as the three - state potts model does not mean that all the physics in the region of the critical point is the same .",
    "the key difference is the presence here of the linear spatial derivative proportional to @xmath68 , which is clearly allowed under the symmetries ( [ inversion ] ) .",
    "this term is _ chiral _ , in that it breaks rotational symmetry .",
    "the exact results show no evidence of chiral behavior , so the effective theory describing the integrable line presumably corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "varying @xmath70 at @xmath69 therefore moves one along the integrable line , and describes the usual physics of the three - state potts model : a second - order transition between @xmath13 order and disorder .",
    "when one moves off the integrable line ( taking @xmath71 in the effective theory ) , the theory in the universality class of the _ chiral clock model _ @xcite .",
    "the chiral perturbation , @xmath68 , is known to be relevant at the ordinary potts critical point @xcite , with scaling dimension 1/5 ; the perturbing operator has dimensions @xmath72 and breaks lorentz invariance .",
    "thus for @xmath71 , the quantum phase transition associated with the vanishing of density - wave order of period 3 is in general _ not _ in the same universality class as the usual order / disorder transition in the ordinary 3-state potts model .",
    "the integrable point @xmath17 is an isolated multicritical point ; all other points on the phase boundary of the period-3 state must have @xmath73 , and display the physics of the chiral clock model . note the contrast with the corresponding transition associated with density - wave order of period 2 : this transition is in the ising universality class because @xmath56 is real , and then the term proportional to @xmath68 is a vanishing total derivative .",
    "the chiral clock model is generally believed to exhibit an incommensurate phase @xcite . in the region near the multicritical point @xmath17 , this occurs when the chiral perturbation ( @xmath71 ) dominates over the thermal perturbation ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this region is therefore quite narrow , because @xmath68 , of dimension @xmath75 , is much less relevant than @xmath70 , which is of dimension @xmath76 .",
    "thus @xmath70 must effectively vanish for the effects of the chiral perturbation to be felt . in the next section",
    ", we will show that the incommensurate phase does have a finite ( albeit small ) width far from the multicritical point , where @xmath22 and @xmath7 are large , with @xmath77 .",
    "there is no indication that any more new physics intervenes in between this region and the incommensurate region near @xmath17 , so we presume that these two phases are the same , as we have indicated in fig",
    ".  [ phase ] .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we will describe our numerical study of the physics in the limit @xmath39 , which corresponds to being on the portion of the phase boundary of the period-3 state _ above _ the multicritical point @xmath17 in fig  [ phase ] .",
    "our numerical results here are inconclusive , as we see little deviation from the pure 3-state potts physics for the system sizes examined .",
    "we will study the portion of the phase boundary _ below _",
    "@xmath17 in section  [ sec : float ] , and there we shall definitively establish the existence of a gapless incommensurate phase , driven by the presence of the chiral perturbation ; the ordering wavevector , @xmath78 , of this incommensurate phase obeys @xmath79 .",
    "a simple fluctuation analysis of @xmath80 indicates that @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath68 . as @xmath68 vanishes at @xmath17 where @xmath82",
    ", these results suggest the conjecture that there is a small intermediate , gapless , incommensurate phase also above the point @xmath17 , but with a change in sign of @xmath68 leading to an ordering wavevector @xmath83 .",
    "our numerical studies below , however , do not show any specific evidence in support of this conjecture .",
    "this is possibly because the scaling dimension of the chiral perturbation is quite small , and very large system sizes are needed before its effects are perceptible .",
    "furthermore , we shall find in the study of the portion of the phase boundary below @xmath17 in section  [ sec : float ] that the region of incommensurate spin correlations is extremely small , and it is likely that a similar feature holds in the above @xmath17 region being studied here .",
    "the numerical analysis for large @xmath7 is simplified by simply eliminating all states with an energy determined by @xmath7 .",
    "this is equivalent to extending the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) to @xmath84 and working with the simplified hamiltonian @xmath85 \\label{hps}\\ ] ] the exact diagonalization of @xmath86 can then be carried out for system sizes @xmath87 .",
    "first , we searched for the preferred values of @xmath53 in a system of size @xmath88 .",

    "all of the periods shown above show no sign of spontaneous order.,width=307 ]    the response at periods @xmath93 is always _ much _ smaller , and so we see no sign of spontaneous order at any other wavevectors .",
    "interestingly , the largest secondary response is at the wavevector @xmath94 .",
    "this is contrary to our expectations earlier based on the influence of the chiral perturbation in ( [ schiral ] ) , where we anticipated incommensurate order at wavevectors smaller than @xmath95 .",
    "however , given the very small susceptibility , and the small system sizes considered we are not able to interpret any of this data in support of an incommensurate phase .",
    "any such phase , if present , must be over an extremely small parameter regime , as is found in section  [ sec : float ]    ignoring the presence of a possible intermediate incommensurate phase , we now see if our data can be interpreted in the context of a direct transition from the gapped density - wave state of period 3 , to a gapped `` liquid '' state which does not break any translational symmetries .",
    "we expect such a transition to be in the potts universality class .",
    "indeed , we now show that our data are in complete accord with such an assumption , with excellent agreement to the expected values of the critical exponents .",

    "computing @xmath348 is then similar to the @xmath290 case of @xcite , yielding @xmath349 since none of the quantities inside the derivative depends on @xmath284 , we can use the calculation of @xcite to get @xmath350 where @xmath325 is defined above via ( [ taudef ] ) . combining this with our computation of the velocity above yields",
    "finally the luttinger parameter @xmath351 the effect of the hard - core constraints ends up being the @xmath352 in the numerator .",
    "we have seen that when the coupling @xmath155 , there are no @xmath53 bosons in the ground state",

    "for some value of @xmath119 , @xmath357 .",
    "we can find out how many bosons there are here , because in this limit we can solve the equation ( [ dos ] ) by fourier transformation .",
    "actually , to just get @xmath358 , we do not need to go to the trouble : we know from the xxz model that @xmath359 thus in our case , we have @xmath360 . the equation ( [ luttparam ] ) for the luttinger parameter",
    "is therefore valid only for values of chemical potential such that only solutions of the bethe equations with all bare momenta real are present in the ground state . in other words , ( [ luttparam ] ) is valid only for @xmath119 such that @xmath361 . to find the luttinger parameter for the remaining range of @xmath119",
    ", we can repeat the above analysis for the @xmath125 bosons .",
    "this yields @xmath362 where @xmath363 is the maximum rapidity of a @xmath125 boson in the ground state . by the same argument",
    ", this expression is valid for @xmath364 .    because @xmath365 , the expressions for the luttinger parameter are both valid at exactly one point : where @xmath366 , @xmath367 .",
    "this provides a good check on our result : at @xmath368 , @xmath367 , comparing the expressions ( [ luttparam ] ) and ( [ luttparam2 ] ) yields @xmath369 , as noted in general in ( [ k1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , we can find the exact value of @xmath180 at this point , by either a weiner - hopf analysis @xcite , or by appealing to the xxz model , where the answer is known .",
    "either way , one finds that @xmath370 for our case of @xmath223 , we have therefore @xmath371 , so vortices are relevant here .",
    "another check on our results is to note that the computation of the velocity @xmath167 must give the same answer at this point whether computing with the @xmath125 bosons or the @xmath53 bosons .",
    "indeed , we see from ( [ khole ] ) and ( [ ehole ] ) that both are independent of @xmath284 and @xmath285 , only depending on @xmath298 ; since @xmath298 is the same for both pictures , we do get the same answer .     as a function of @xmath119 .",
    "recall that @xmath372.,width=336 ]    the incommensurate regime is characterized by having @xmath373 .",
    "we can not analytically find the value of @xmath119 where @xmath374 , but it is straightforward to solve the above integral equations numerically .",
    "first , one must determine the value of @xmath298 for a given @xmath119 by solving ( [ dos ] ) for @xmath300 and @xmath298 while demanding that the energy ( [ epba ] ) be minimized .",
    "integrating @xmath300 yields the ground - state particle density @xmath375 as well . knowing @xmath298 then allows one to solve ( [ chidef ] ) for @xmath340 and hence @xmath376 . plugging this into ( [ luttparam ] )",
    "then yields the luttinger parameter .",
    "we find that @xmath377 when @xmath378 .",
    "this leads to our final result for the phase diagram : the incommensurate phase exists only for @xmath379 the incommensurate region is also very narrow near the potts critical point @xmath17 , so it is likely that it occupies a very small region of parameter space .",
    "we plot @xmath180 as obtained above in fig  [ luttplot ] .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper was to provide a thorough study of the very simple one - dimensional boson model in ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "this model was originally motivated by the studies of ` tilted ' mott insulators of atoms in optical lattices . despite its simplicity , our model has a rich phase diagram , shown in fig  [ phase ] , with a many competing ordered phases and possibilities for exact solutions .",
    "our solutions shed additional light on the nature of the phase transition in the chiral clock model . over a certain regime of parameters , we provide definitive evidence for a gapless , floating incommensurate phase adjacent to the gapped @xmath13 ordered phase with a period-3 density wave . however , the size of this incommensurate phase was remarkably small , making it unlikely that it will ever be observed in experimental or numerical studies .",
    "we also obtained specific realizations of two of the exactly soluble multi - critical points identified by andrews _",
    "@xcite , which are now known to be part of the series of minimal conformal models @xcite .",
    "it is likely that our analysis could be generalized to this series ; it would be interesting in particular to see if the incommensurate phases existed in general .",

    "in this appendix we show that the quantum hamiltonian @xmath5 in ( [ h ] ) generates precisely the transfer matrix of the classical , two - dimensional hard - square model introduced by baxter @xcite .",
    "it is useful to note that the hard - square model , as defined in the introduction , can also be interpreted as a certain ` interface ' or ` height ' model . in particular",
    ", it is identical to the so - called @xmath380 restricted - solid - on - solid ( rsos ) @xcite . to see the connection with the rsos model , we need to associate each tile configuration with a corresponding set of heights .",
    "on one sublattice of the square lattice , associate each site with a tile present with height @xmath381 , and a vacancy with height @xmath382 . on the other sublattice ,",
    "associate each tile with height @xmath383 , and a vacancy with height @xmath384 .",
    "then the hard - square restrictions are simply encoded in a set of constraints on heights on nearest neighbor sites : height @xmath381 can only be next to @xmath384 , @xmath384 can be next to @xmath382 or @xmath381 , @xmath382 can only be next to @xmath384 or @xmath383 , and @xmath383 can only be next to @xmath382 .",
    "these height restrictions are conveniently summarized in the @xmath380 dynkin diagram , and hence the terminology .",
    "like the hard - square case , the general @xmath385 rsos models are solvable along two lines , with one critical point on each . these critical points are multicritical points with known conformal - field - theory descriptions @xcite .    here",
    ", we continue to use the terminology of hard squares .",

    "we will now take the so - called @xmath65-continuum limit of this transfer matrix , so that we may obtain the corresponding hamiltonian which evolves the states in a continuous imaginary time . to take this hamiltonian limit ,",
    "we define @xmath397 and @xmath398 .",
    "then the boltzmann weights for all the allowed possible states around each plaquette are shown in fig .",
