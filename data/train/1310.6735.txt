    "the ongoing survey of the @xmath0-ray sky with the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) has led to a tremendous increase in the known population of @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "the 2-year _ fermi_-lat catalog ( 2fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) lists 1873 sources , divided into the following classes : 1 ) active galactic nuclei ( agn ; @xmath160% ) ; 2 ) pulsars and binary systems ( 6% ) ; 3 ) supernova remnants , pulsar wind nebulae and other galactic sources ( 4% ) ; and unassociated sources ( @xmath130% ) .",
    "thus the second largest ` class ' consists of sources that do not have a clear association with plausible counterparts at other wavelengths . at the very least ,",
    "this large number of mysterious @xmath0-ray sources includes outliers of known classes of sources .",
    "it is not unreasonable to suppose that a subset of these sources could provide a pathway to new discoveries .",
    "the unassociated sources in the 2fgl catalog at high galactic latitude ( @xmath2 ) are likely to fall under two main categories : agns or millisecond pulsars ( msps )",
    ". the members of each category share characteristic @xmath0-ray properties that can be used as patterns to evaluate the probability of a given source to belong to a class of objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the typical @xmath0-ray signature for an agn is non - periodic variability and a power - law or broken power - law spectral shape ( see , e.g. , the second _ fermi - lat _ catalog of agn , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for pulsars and msps ,",
    "the key to identification is the detection of pulsations in @xmath0-rays .",
    "further , their spectra are usually curved and present a cut - off around a few gev ( see , e.g. , the first _ fermi _ pulsar catalog , * ? ? ?",
    "although the source localization accuracy made possible by the _ fermi - lat _ has greatly improved over previous @xmath0-ray instruments , the typical 95% confidence level position uncertainty radius ( r@xmath3 ) of 2fgl sources is of the order of @xmath4 , still relatively large with respect to lower energy positional errors to make associations solely based on the @xmath0-ray position .    to resolve this issue",
    ", multi - wavelength campaigns can be decisive in revealing the nature of some _ fermi _ unassociated sources .",
    "for example , the deep search for radio pulsations at @xmath0-ray positions has led to the discovery of unexpectedly large numbers of pulsars and msps @xcite in the population of @xmath0-ray unassociated sources . + in addition ,",
    "x - rays are very good tracers of energetic processes , and above a few kev they are not affected by absorption along the line of sight . from the observational point of view , the current x - ray satellites have relatively large fields of view ( fov ) , high sensitivity and a localization at the arcsec level .",
    "a precise location , derived from the x - rays , can also strongly enhance the sensitivity of @xmath0-ray blind searches for pulsation of isolated pulsars @xcite with _ fermi_-lat by dramatically reducing the numbers of position trials . in the case of an msp in a binary system , optical observations of the companion are needed to obtain the orbital period of the system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent example ) .",
    "however , it is often found that there is more than one plausible x - ray counterpart to a _ fermi _ unassociated source . while this number can largely vary depending on the position on the sky and the characteristics of the telescope , @xcite , for example , found @xmath110 sources with the _ chandra _ x - ray telescope in the error ellipses of the two brightest 0fgl unassociated sources 0fgl j1311.9 - 3419 and 0fgl j1653.4 - 0200 . in those cases",
    ", the high spatial resolution and large frequency range provided by radio interferometry can provide a crucial step in identifying the counterpart .",
    "observations at multiple radio frequencies are useful as they can indicate the nature of the object identified , e.g. , relatively high compact radio flux density and a flat radio spectrum suggest the object could be an agn . once a potential agn counterpart has been identified , optical follow - up to search for a redshift and optical polarization will provide another strong piece of evidence .",
    "unambiguous identification is made when correlated variability is observed in @xmath0 rays and another wavelength .    the identification of _ fermi _ unassociated sources with known classes of astrophysical objects is of interest , not least because these new identifications often constitute a new population , e.g. agn identifications might discover a subclass of radio - weak , @xmath0-ray loud objects .     on a population scale ,",
    "several groups ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have developed methods to try to predict the nature of a _ fermi _ unassociated source based on a subset of its @xmath0-ray features that were found to be effective at discriminating between agn and pulsars .",
    "@xcite , for example , used the spectral and variability information about the lat sources to assign a probability p(agn ) that an unassociated source is an agn .",
    "other approaches have studied the lower wavelength counterparts to the @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "for example , @xcite have developed a method to identify the agn candidates among the 2fgl unassociated sources based on the colors of the infrared counterparts lying within the _ fermi _ error ellipse using the all - sky survey from the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _",
    "( _ wise _ ) .",
    "while the largest class of predicted sources from all these methods is agn , some sources did not fit in the agn or pulsars category , and were considered `` unclassifiable '' or `` outlier objects '' .",
    "it is vital to make these identifications so that the properties of these truly  exotic \" _ fermi _ unassociated sources can be studied .",
    "to limit the potential multi - wavelength counterparts to explore , we selected bright unassociated @xmath0-ray sources ( average significance in all energy bands given in the 2fgl @xmath510 ) , as these usually have smaller position uncertainty .",
    "we selected sources located at high latitude ( @xmath6@xmath75@xmath8 ) where the density of potential counterparts is lower .",
    "we removed all unassociated sources labeled as  c \" in 2fgl ( those found in a region with bright and/or possibly incorrectly modeled diffuse emission ) .",
    "those different selection criteria reduced the sample of unassociated _ fermi _ sources in the 2fgl from 555 to 85 ( @xmath910 ) , then 33 ( @xmath6@xmath75@xmath8 ) and finally 32 ( no  c \" flag ) .    amongst this sample of bright , high latitude and unconfused unassociated 2fgl targets , we selected the sources that had been observed in the x - rays by the _ swift _ satellite , whose x - ray telescope ( xrt ) fov typically encompasses the _ fermi _ uncertainty ellipse .",
    "we excluded sources observed by other recent x - ray missions ( i.e. , _ xmm _ , _ suzaku _ , and _",
    "chandra _ ) because these data sets have already been studied extensively . in 2010 , _ swift _ began a systematic search for x - ray counterparts of _ fermi_-lat unassociated sources ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for this reason , the large majority of those bright , high latitude unassociated 2fgl targets have x - ray coverage .",
    "we selected only observations with at least 3.5 ksec exposure time .",
    "our final list includes 22 @xmath0-sources .",
    "the _ swift _ observations were analyzed ( see sect .",
    "[ xray ] ) to identify potential x - ray counterparts within the _ fermi _ r@xmath3 error ellipse . among the 22 @xmath0-ray sources , 16 had at least one x ",

    "] had no x - ray counterpart and represent a puzzling sample that would require deeper x - ray observations .",
    "the spatial resolution of the _ swift _ xrt ( 18  half power diameter ) allows a localization at the level of a few arcseconds .",
    "once this precise position in the x - ray is obtained , multi - wavelength follow - ups with radio , ir , or optical observatories ( whose fov is typically smaller ) are possible .",
    "the combination of x - ray and follow - up radio observations provides a powerful tool to test the two most common known scenarios ( agn or pulsar and msp ) for our sample of _ fermi _ unassociated sources .",
    "sources that do not show typical characteristics of these two populations are therefore promising candidates for new discoveries .",
    "multi - frequency radio observations of x - ray counterparts are useful to search for radio flat spectrum sources , a typical signature for an agn . if no radio counterpart to the x - ray source is detected ( or is faintly detected only at the lowest radio frequency ) , the @xmath0-ray source might be a good msp candidate .",
    "obtaining the precise x - ray positions of the potential counterparts was a key element to optimize our radio observation strategy .",
    "these x - ray positions were used to carry out follow - up observations with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) radio telescope and to minimize the number of radio pointings per _ fermi _ source .",
    "this approach allowed deeper observation of each x - ray counterpart .",
    "the typical _ fermi _ error ellipse is 0.1@xmath8 in the semi major axis and the primary beam of the atca radio telescope at the observed frequencies ranges from about 10 arcmin at 5.5ghz to about 1 arcmin at 40ghz .    from the list of 16 @xmath0-ray sources with at least one x - ray counterpart ,",

    "could be associated with a narrow  line seyfert 1 galaxy , a rare class of @xmath0-ray emitter .",
    "although the limited sample considered here , we note that x - rays are good tracers of potential agn counterparts as , when a bright x - ray source was found in our sample , a radio flat spectrum counterpart was detected .",
    "follow - up optical observations are planned to determine the redshift of those agn candidates as well as to confirm the narrow  line seyfert 1 nature of j1844.3@xmath411548 .",
    "our study confirms that the combination of x - rays and radio follow - up observations provides an efficient method to identify agn candidates among the _ fermi _ unassociated sources .",
    "it is also interesting to note that our list of agn candidates constructed using multi - wavelength properties is in agreement with the prediction , based on the gev properties only , made by @xcite .",
    "the identification of candidates belonging to known classes of astrophysical objects narrows down the list of associated sources to the truly exotic objects .",
    "additionally , the newly discovered members of known classes are also of great interest as they represent outliers in their respective classes . for example",
    ", our new candidate agn ( j1129.5@xmath413758 ) may belong to a potentially important subclass : high compton dominance agn .",

    "the radio - weak , @xmath0-ray loud agn we detect are increasing the size of this key sample , which can address the many questions that the relation of the compton dominance to agn properties like peak synchrotron frequency @xcite raise , e.g. , the existence of the  blazar sequence \" @xcite .",
    "the precise location of the putative counterpart of the pulsar candidate we have identified in our sample ( j1036.1 - 6722 ) , will be used to perform deep @xmath0-ray pulsation searches .",
    "the improved location translates to a dramatic reduction in the volume of phase space that will need to be searched , making this task computationally more feasible .    in @xcite ,",

    "we have demonstrated that this object is probably associated with an agn and unlikely to be a signature of dark matter annihilation .    in our hunt to identify the truly  exotic \" objects , we found an intriguing pair ( j0523.3 - 2530 and j1231.3 - 5112 ) of @xmath0-ray sources whose multi - wavelength properties do not seem to fit in the pulsar or in the agn category .",
