    "electronic structure calculations are today an important tool for investigating the physics and chemistry of new molecules and materials.@xcite an important factor for the success of these techniques is the development of first principles methods that make reliable modeling of a wide range of systems possible without introducing system dependent parameters .",
    "most methods are , however , limited in two aspects : ( 1 ) the geometry is restricted to either finite or periodic systems , and ( 2 ) the electronic system must be in equilibrium . in order to address theoretically the situation where an atomic / molecular - scale system ( contact ) is connected to bulk electrodes of requires a method capable of treating an infinite and non - periodic system . in the case where a finite voltage bias applied to the electrodes",
    "drives a current through the contact , the electronic subsystem is not in thermal equilibrium and the model must be able to describe this nonequilibrium situation .",
    "the aim of the present work is to develop a new first principles nonequilibrium electronic structure method for modeling a nanostructure coupled to external electrodes with different electrochemical potentials ( we will interchange the terms _ electrochemical potential _ and _ fermi level _ throughout the paper ) .",
    "besides , we wish to treat the whole system ( contact and electrodes ) on the same footing , describing the electronic structure of both at the same level",
    ".    our method is based on the density functional theory ( dft).@xcite in principle the exact electronic density and total energy can be obtained within the dft if the exact exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional was available .",
    "this is not the case and the xc functional has to be substituted by an approximate functional .",
    "the most simple form is the local density approximation ( lda ) , but recently a number of other more complicated functionals have been proposed , which have been shown to generally improve the description of systems in equilibrium.@xcite there is no rigorous theory of the validity range of these functionals and in practice it is determined by testing the functional for a wide range of systems where the theoretical results can be compared with reliable experimental data or with other more precise calculations .    here",
    "we will take this pragmatic approach one step further : we will use not only the total electron density , but the kohn - sham wave functions as _ bona fide _ single - particle wave functions when calculating the electronic current .",
    "thus we assume that the commonly used xc functionals are able to describe the electrons in non - equilibrium situations where a current flow is present , as in the systems we wish to study.@xcite this mean - field - like , one - electron approach is not able to describe pronounced many - body effects which may appear in in some cases during the transport process .",
    "inelastic scattering _",
    "e.g. _ by phonons@xcite will not be considered , either .    except for the approximations inherent in the dft , the xc functional , and the use of the kohn - sham wave functions to obtain a current , all other approximations in the method are controllable , in the sense that they can be systematically improved to check for convergence towards the exact result ( within the given xc functional ) .",
    "examples of this are the size and extent of the basis set ( which can be increased to completeness ) , the numerical integration cutoffs ( which can be improved to convergence ) , or the size of the electrode buffer regions included in the selfconsistent calculation ( see below ) .",
    "this mean - field - like , one - electron approach is not able to describe pronounced many - body effects which may appear in in some cases during the transport process .",
    "inelastic scattering _",
    "e.g. _ by phonons@xcite will not be considered , either .",
    "previous calculations for open systems have in most cases been based on semi - empirical approaches.@xcite the first non - equilibrium calculations with a full self - consistent dft description of the entire system have employed the jellium approximation in the electrodes.@xcite other approaches have used an equilibrium first principles hamiltonian for the nanostructure and described the electrodes by including semi - empirical selfenergies on the outermost atoms.@xcite lately , there have been several approaches which treat the entire system on the same footing , at the atomic level@xcite but so far only one of the approaches have been applied to the nonequilibrium situation where the external leads have different electrochemical potentials.@xcite    the starting point for our implementation is the siesta electronic structure approach.@xcite in this method the effect of the core electrons is described by soft norm - conserving pseudopotentials@xcite and the electronic structure of the valence electrons is expanded in a basis set of numerical atomic orbitals with finite range.@xcite the quality of the basis set can be improved at will by using multiple-@xmath0 orbitals , polarization functions , etc.,@xcite allowing to achieve convergence of the results to the desired level of accuracy .",
    "siesta has been tested in a wide variety of systems , with excellent results.@xcite the great advantage of using orbitals with finite range ( besides the numerical efficiency@xcite ) , is that the hamiltonian interactions are strictly zero beyond some distance , which allows to partition the system unambiguously , and define regions where we will do different parts of the calculation as we describe in the sections  [ sec : sysset]-[sec : veff ] .",
    "besides , the hamiltonian takes the same form as in empirical tight - binding calculations , and therefore the techniques developed in this context can be straightforwardly applied .",
    "we have extended the siesta computational package to nonequilibrium systems by calculating the density matrix with a nonequilibrium greens functions technique.@xcite we have named this nonequilibrium electronic structure code transiesta .",
    "preliminary results obtained with transiesta were presented in ref .  .",
    "here we give a detailed account of the technical implementation and present results for the transport properties of different atomic scale systems .",
    "one of the authors ( jt ) has been involved in the independent development of a package , mcdcal,@xcite which is based on similar principles , but with some differences in implementation .",
    "we compare results obtained with the two packages for a carbon wire connected to aluminum electrodes and show that they yield similar results .",
    "we present new results for atomic gold wire systems which are one of the most studied atomic scale conductors , and finally we present results for transport in nanotubes with defects .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in the first part of the paper",
    "we describe how we divide our system into the contact and electrode parts and how we obtain the density matrix for the nonequilibrium situation using green s functions . here",
    "we also discuss the relation between the scattering state approach and the nonequilibrium green s function expression for the density matrix .",
    "then we describe how this is implemented in the numerical procedures and how we solve the poisson equation in the case of finite bias . in the second part of the paper we turn to the applications where our aim is to illustrate the method and show some of its capabilities rather than presenting detailed analysis of our findings .",
    "we compare our results with other _",
    "ab initio _ calculations or experiments for ( 1 ) carbon wires connected to aluminum electrodes , ( 2 ) gold wires connected to gold electrodes , and finally ( 3 ) infinite carbon nanotubes containing defects .",
    "we will consider the situation sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : setup1d]a .",
    "two semi - infinite electrodes , left and right , are coupled via a contact region .",
    "all matrix elements of the hamiltonian or overlap integrals between orbitals on atoms situated in different electrodes are zero so the coupling between the left and right electrodes takes place _ via _ the contact region only .",
    "the region of interest is thus separated into three parts , _ left _ ( @xmath1 ) , _ contact _ ( @xmath2 ) and _ right _",
    "( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the atoms in @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) are assumed to be the parts of the left ( right ) semi - infinite bulk electrodes with which the atoms in region @xmath2 interact .",
    "the hamiltonian is assumed to be converged to the bulk values in region @xmath1 and @xmath3 along with the density matrix .",
    "thus the hamiltonian , density and overlap matrices only differ from bulk values in the @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 parts .",
    "we can test this assumption by including a larger fraction of the electrodes in @xmath2 ( so the @xmath1 and @xmath3 regions are positioned further away from the surfaces in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup1d ] ) .    in order to obtain the transport properties of the system",
    ", we only need to describe the finite @xmath6 part of the infinite system as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup1d]b . the density matrix which describes the distribution of electrons can be obtained from a series of green s function matrices of the infinite system as we will discuss in detail in section  [ sec : nedm ] . in principle",
    "the green s function matrix involves the inversion of an infinite matrix corresponding to the infinite system with all parts of the electrodes included .",
    "we are , however , only interested in the finite @xmath6 part of the density matrix and thus of the green s function matrix .",
    "we can obtain this part by inverting the _ finite _ matrix , @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the hamiltonian matrices in the @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 regions , respectively , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the interaction between the @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath2 regions .",
    "the coupling of @xmath1 and @xmath3 to the remaining part of the semi - infinite electrodes is fully taken into account by the self - energies , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we note that to determine @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 , we do not need to know the correct density matrix outside the @xmath6 region , as long as this does not influence the electrostatic potential inside the region .",
    "this is the case for metallic electrodes , if the @xmath6 region is defined sufficiently large so that all the screening takes place inside of it .",
    "the upper and lower part of the hamiltonian ( @xmath15 ) are determined from two separate calculations for the bulk systems corresponding to the bulk of the left and right electrode systems .",
    "these systems have periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath16 directions , and are solved using bloch s theorem . from these calculations",
    "we also determine the self - energies by cutting the electrode systems into two semi - infinite pieces using either the ideal construction@xcite or the efficient recursion method.@xcite    the remaining parts of the hamiltonian , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 , depend on the non - equilibrium electron density and are determined through a selfconsistent procedure . in section",
    "[ sec : nedm ] we will describe how the non - equilibrium density matrix can be calculated given these parts of the hamiltonian , while in section  [ sec : veff ] we show how the effective potential and thereby the hamiltonian matrix elements are calculated from the density matrix .",
    "in this section we will first present the relationship between the scattering state approach and the non - equilibrium green s function expression for the non - equilibrium electron density corresponding to the situation when the electrodes have different electrochemical potentials .",
    "the scattering state approach is quite transparent and has been used for non - equilibrium first principles calculations by mccann and brown,@xcite lang and co - workers,@xcite and tsukada and co - workers.@xcite all these calculations have been for the case of model jellium electrodes and it is not straightforward how to extend these methods to the case of electrodes with a realistic atomic structure and a more complicated electronic structure or when localized states are present inside the contact region . the use of the non - equilibrium green s functions combined with a localized basis set is able to deal with these points more easily .    here",
    "we will start with the scattering state approach and make the connection to the non - equilibrium green s function expressions for the density matrix . consider the scattering states starting in the left electrode .",
    "these are generated from the unperturbed incoming states ( labeled by @xmath17 ) of the uncoupled , semi - infinite electrode , @xmath18 , using the retarded green s function , @xmath19 , of the coupled system , @xmath20 as in the previous section there is no _ direct _ interaction between the electrodes : @xmath21    our non - equilibrium situation is described by the following scenario : the states starting deep in the left / right electrode are filled up to the electrochemical potential of the left ( right ) electrode , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we construct the density matrix from the ( incoming ) scattering states of the left and right electrode :    @xmath24    where index @xmath17 and @xmath25 run over all scattering states in the left and right electrode , respectively . note that this density matrix only describes states in @xmath2 which couple to the continuum of electrode states",
    " we shall later in section  [ subsec : locstat ] return to the states localized in @xmath2 .",
    "here we will rather consider the density matrix defined in terms of coefficients of the scattering states with respect to the given basis ( denoted below by greek subindexes ) @xmath26 thus ( [ eq : realspaceg ] ) and ( [ eq : realspacedm ] ) read , @xmath27 @xmath28 the basis is in general non - orthogonal but this will not introduce any further complications . as for the hamiltonian , we assume that the matrix elements of the overlap , @xmath29 , are zero between basis functions in @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the overlap is handled by defining the green s function matrix @xmath30 as the inverse of @xmath31 , and including the term @xmath32 in the perturbation matrix @xmath33 . to see this we use the following equations ,    @xmath34c^0_{l }   & = & 0 \\ , , \\label{eq : ho}\\\\ \\left[\\varepsilon_l{\\bf s}-{\\bf h}\\right]c_{l }         & = & 0 \\,,\\label{eq : h}\\\\ \\left[z{\\bf s}-{\\bf h}\\right]{\\bf g}(z ) & = & \\openone          \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with these definitions we see that ( [ eq : cols ] ) is fulfilled , @xmath35c_{l } =   \\left[\\varepsilon_l{\\bf s } - { \\bf h}\\right]c^0_{l } + { \\bf v}c^0_{l } = 0 \\,,\\ ] ] when @xmath36 the use of a non - orthogonal basis is described further in refs .   and .",
    "the density matrix naturally splits into left and right parts .",
    "the derivations for left and right are similar , so we will concentrate on left only .",

    "the ends of the carbon chain are positioned in the al(100 ) hollow site and the distance between the ends of the carbon chain and the first plane of al atoms is fixed to be @xmath126  . in system b the carbon chain is coupled to two al(100)-(@xmath127 ) surfaces with an al - c coupling similar to system a. in this case the electrode unit cell contains 2 layers each with 8 atoms .",
    "for both systems the contact region ( @xmath2 ) includes 3 layers of atoms in the left electrode and 4 layers of the right electrode .",
    "we use single-@xmath0 basis sets for both c and al to be able to compare with the results from mcdcal , which were obtained with that basis.@xcite    the conductance of system a is dominated by the alignment of the lumo state of the isolated chain to the fermi level of the electrodes through charge transfer.@xcite the coupling of the lumo , charge transfer , and total conductance can be varied continuously by adjusting the electrode - chain separation.@xcite for our value of the electrode - chain separation we get a charge transfer of 1.43 and 1.28 @xmath128 to the carbon wire in systems a and b , respectively .",
    "this is slightly larger than the values obtained by lang and avouris@xcite for jellium electrodes , but in good agreement with results from mcdcal.@xcite    to facilitate a more direct comparison between the methods we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : cwirelead ] the transmission coefficient of system a calculated both within transiesta ( solid ) and mcdcal ( dotted ) . for both methods ,",
    "we have used identical basis sets and pseudopotentials .",
    "however , several technical details in the implementations differ and may lead to small differences in the transmission spectra .",
    "the main implementation differences between the two methods are related to the calculation of hamiltonian parameters for the electrode region , the solution of the poisson s equation , and the complex contours used to obtain the electron charge.@xcite thus , there are many technical differences in the two methods , and we therefore find the close agreement in fig .",
    "[ fig : cwirelead ] very satisfactory .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cwire100 ] we show the corresponding transmission coefficients for system b. it can be seen that the transmission coefficient for zero bias at @xmath129 is close to 1 for both systems , thus they have similar conductance .",
    "however , the details in the transmission spectra differs much from system a. in order to get some insight into the origin of the different features we have projected the selfconsistent hamiltonian onto the carbon orbitals , and diagonalised this subspace hamiltonian to find the position of the carbon eigenstates in the presence of the al electrodes . within the energy window shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cwirelead ] and [ fig : cwire100 ] we find 4 doubly degenerate @xmath130-states ( 3@xmath130 , 4@xmath130 , 5@xmath130 , 6@xmath130 ) .",
    "the positions of the eigenstates are indicated above the transmission curves .",
    "each doubly degenerate state can contribute to the transmission with 2 at most . generally , the position of the carbon @xmath130 states give rise to a slow variation in the transmission coefficient , and the fast variation is related to the coupling between different scattering states in the electrodes and the carbon @xmath130-states .",
    "for instance in system a , there are two energy intervals [ -1.9,-1.7 ] and [ 0.7,1.4 ] , where the transmission coefficient is zero , and the scattering states in these energy intervals are therefore not coupling to the carbon wire . note how these zero transmission intervals are doubled at finite bias , since the scattering states of the left and right electrode are now displaced .",
    "the energy dependence of the transmission coefficient is quite different in system b compared to system a. this is mainly due to the differences in the electronic structure of the surface compared to the finite sized electrode .",
    "however , the electronic states of the carbon wires are also slightly different .",
    "we find that the @xmath130-states lie @xmath131 ev higher in energy in system b relative to system a. as mentioned previously , the charge transfer to the carbon chain is different in the two systems .",
    "the origin of this is related to a larger work function ( @xmath132ev ) of the surface relative to the lead .",
    "we note that the calculated work function of the surface is 0.76 ev higher than the experimental workfunction of al ( 4.4 ev),@xcite which may be due to the use of a single-@xmath0 basis set and the approximate exchange - correlation description.@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cwire]d , we show the changes in the effective potential when a 1 v bias is applied .",
    "we find that the potential does not drop continuously across the wire . in system",
    "a , the main potential drop is at the interface between the carbon wire and the right electrode , while in system b the potential drop takes place at the interface to the left electrode .",
    "this should be compared to the jellium results , where there is a more continuous voltage drop through the system.@xcite we do not yet understand the details of the origin of these voltage drops .",

    "thus , we find it is qualitatively and quantitatively important to have a good description of the electronic structure of the electrodes .",
    "the conductance of single atom gold wires is a benchmark in atomic scale conduction . since the first experiments@xcite numerous detailed studies of their conductance have been carried out through the 1990s until now ( see e.g. ref .   for a review ) .",
    "more recently the non - linear conductance@xcite has been investigated and the atomic structure@xcite of these systems has been elucidated .",
    "experiments show that chains containing more than 5 gold atoms@xcite can be pulled and that these can remain stable for an extended period of time at low temperature .",
    "a large number of experiments employing different techniques and under a variety of conditions ( ambient pressure and uhv , room and liquid he temperature ) all show that the conductance at low bias is very close to 1 @xmath133 and several experiments point to the fact that this is due to a single conductance eigenchannel.@xcite    several theoretical investigations have addressed the stability and morphology  @xcite and the conductance  @xcite of atomic gold chains and contacts using dft .",
    "however , for the evaluation of the conductance , these studies have neglected the presence of valence @xmath134-electrons and the scattering due to the non - local pseudopotential .",

    "was found to be energetically preferred over a linear structure in the case of infinite atomic gold chains , free standing clusters , and short wires suspended between two pyramidal tips . in general the structure of the wires will be determined by the fixed distance between the electrodes and the wires will therefore most probably be somewhat compressed or stretched .",
    "here we have considered wires with a length of three atoms and situated between the ( 111 ) electrodes with different spacing .",
