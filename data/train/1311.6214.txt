    "one of the long standing challenges in hadron physics is to establish and classify genuine multiquark states other than baryons ( 3 quark states ) and mesons ( quark - antiquark states )  @xcite . in particular , charmed tetraquarks ( such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) and bottomed tetraquarks ( such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 )",
    "are unambiguous candidates for such multiquark states  @xcite , since there are no annihilations among the four quarks .",
    "if they form bound states or resonances with respect to the corresponding two - meson thresholds , they could be experimentally observed in @xmath16-factories and relativistic heavy - ion colliders @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we exclusively investigate the charmed tetraquarks @xmath17 and @xmath18 . to understand a possible reason why they may appear as bound states below the two meson threshold ,",
    "let us consider the diquark picture @xcite as a working hypothesis , where @xmath19 in the color * 3 * , spin - singlet ( @xmath20=0 ) , isospin - singlet ( @xmath6=0 ) channel is denoted as a `` good '' diquark , due to the large attraction between @xmath21 and @xmath22 generated through a gluon exchange .",
    "we now assume that good diquarks are the main substructure of charmed tetraquarks .",
    "then the color - singletness of hadrons and the quark pauli principle constrain the possible low - mass tetraquarks as follows .",
    "@xmath17 ( @xmath23 , @xmath7 ) in which @xmath19 forms a good diquark while the diquark @xmath24 with color @xmath25 and @xmath26 has a weak repulsion between the two charm quarks .",
    "this state couples to the @xmath2-@xmath4 system .",
    "2 .   @xmath18 ( @xmath23 , @xmath7 ) in which @xmath19 forms a good diquark while the diquark @xmath27 with color @xmath25 and @xmath26 has a weak repulsion .",
    "this state couples to the @xmath3-@xmath4 system .",
    "3 .   @xmath18 ( @xmath28 , @xmath7 ) in which @xmath19 forms a good diquark while the diquark @xmath27 with color @xmath25 and @xmath29 has an attraction .",
    "this state couples to the @xmath3-@xmath2 system .",
    "quantitatively , however , predictions for the binding energies of charmed tetraquarks widely spread , ranging from negative values ( resonance ) to 100 mev ( deeply bound ) with respect to the two - meson thresholds , depending on the details of the dynamical models ( diquark model , dynamical four - body calculation in the constituent quark model , meson - meson molecular model , lattice qcd in the heavy - quark limit , etc ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , a quantitative prediction for charmed tetraquarks requires a careful study in full lattice qcd with a finite charm - quark mass.-@xmath30 potentials from lattice qcd was reported previously in @xcite ]    in this letter , we report our first results on the interactions in the @xmath2-@xmath2 , @xmath3-@xmath2 , @xmath2-@xmath4 and @xmath3-@xmath4 systems in ( 2 + 1)-flavor lattice qcd simulations .",
    "the dynamics of the charm quarks are incorporated on the lattice with the relativistic heavy quark action  @xcite .",
    "the meson - meson scattering phase shifts are derived from the corresponding potentials calculated on the lattice by the hal qcd method  @xcite ( reviewed in @xcite ) , which was recently shown to be quite accurate to describe some meson - meson scattering phase shifts @xcite .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in sec .  2 , we present the hal qcd method to extract the potential between two mesons .",
    "we then show the numerical setup of our lattice qcd simulations in sec",
    ".  3 . in sec .  4",
    ", we show our numerical results for the potentials , from which scattering phase shifts and scattering lengths are extracted for three different quark masses .",
    "5 is devoted to a summary and a discussion .",
    "in qcd , the two - meson correlation function can be expanded as @xmath31 with @xmath32 @xmath33 stands for a source operator at @xmath34 which creates two meson states and @xmath35 is a point - like interpolating sink operator for the hadron @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the relativistic energy of the @xmath38-th eigenstate @xmath39 for two mesons , and ellipses represent inelastic contributions .",
    "consider @xmath40 sufficiently larger than @xmath41 that the contributions from elastic scattering states and possible bound states remain while those from inelastic states become negligible .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ 4-point ] ) becomes @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is an equal - time nambu - bethe - salpeter ( nbs ) wave function  @xcite , from which the hal qcd potential @xmath44 is defined  @xcite as a solution of @xmath45 for all elastic eigenstates @xmath38 , where @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a kinetic energy . here",
    "the non - local but @xmath38-independent potential @xmath49 can be shown to exist , by explicitly constructing it as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the dual basis associated with @xmath52 , and the summation over @xmath38 is restricted to elastic channels .",
    "( for details and proofs , see @xcite ) .    in principle",
    ", the potential is extracted from @xmath53 at large @xmath40 , when it is dominated by the @xmath54 state ( i.e. the ground state ) contribution  @xcite . in practice , however , @xmath53 is usually noisier at larger @xmath40 , so that an accurate determination of potentials in this way becomes difficult .    to overcome this practical difficulty ,",
    "an alternative method has been proposed in  @xcite . since @xmath49 is @xmath38-independent by definition , a normalized correlation function @xmath55 satisfies @xmath56 where the non - relativistic approximation that @xmath57 is used . ) , whose contribution , however , turns out to be numerically negligible for the systems investigated in this letter .",
    "] in the velocity expansion of the non - local potential , we finally obtain the leading order potential as @xmath58 within the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "to extract s - wave potentials on the lattice , we consider the projection of the normalized correlation function on the @xmath59 representation of the cubic group ( containing the @xmath60 representation of the rotational group ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 are elements of the cubic group , and @xmath63 are the associated characters of the @xmath64 representation .",
    "we employ ( 2 + 1)-flavor full qcd gauge configurations generated by the pacs - cs collaboration  @xcite on a @xmath65 lattice with the renormalization group improved gauge action at @xmath66 and the non - perturbatively @xmath67-improved wilson quark action ( @xmath68 ) at @xmath69 @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "these parameters correspond to the lattice cutoff @xmath73 mev ( lattice spacing @xmath74 fm ) , determined from @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 masses as inputs  @xcite , leading to the spatial lattice volume @xmath78 .    as for the charm quark , we employ a relativistic heavy quark ( rhq ) action proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is designed to remove the leading and next - to - leading order cutoff errors associated with heavy quark mass , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",

    "in order to clarify the possible existence of charmed tetraquark states ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , we have studied the s - wave meson - meson interactions in several @xmath7 and @xmath89 channels ( @xmath2-@xmath2 , @xmath3-@xmath2 , @xmath2-@xmath4 and @xmath3-@xmath4 ) , using ( 2 + 1)-flavor full qcd gauge configurations generated at @xmath90 mev . for the charm quark ,",

    "s - wave meson - meson potentials are extracted from nambu - bethe - salpeter wave functions using the hal qcd method .",
    "potentials are then used to calculate scattering phase shifts and scattering lengths .",
    "s - wave meson - meson interactions in the @xmath89 channels are found to be repulsive and insensitive to the pion mass in the region we explored , so that tetraquark bound states are unlikely to be formed even at the physical pion mass . on the other hand , the s - wave interactions in the @xmath7 channels show attractions in the @xmath3-@xmath2 , @xmath3-@xmath4 and @xmath2-@xmath4 channels , which are qualitatively consistent with the phenomenological diquark picture .",
    "s - wave scattering phase shifts in these attractive channels indicate , however , that no bound states or resonances are formed at the pion masses used in this study , @xmath91 mev , though attractions become more prominent as the pion mass decreases , particularly in the @xmath7 @xmath2-@xmath4 channel corresponding to @xmath92 .    to make a definite conclusion on the fate of @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the real world , simulations near or at the physical point are necessary . we are planning to carry out such simulations with the pacs - cs ( 2 + 1)-flavor full qcd configurations with coupled - channel schemes  @xcite",
