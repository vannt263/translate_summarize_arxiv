    "in recent years , there has been considerable interest in graph structures arising in technological , sociological , and scientific settings : computer networks ( routers or autonomous systems connected together ) ; networks of users exchanging e - mail or instant messages ; citation networks and hyperlink networks ; social networks ( who - trusts - whom , who - talks - to - whom , and so forth ) ; and countless more  @xcite .",
    "the study of such networks has proceeded along two related tracks : the measurement of large network datasets , and the development of random graph models that approximate the observed properties .",
    "many of the properties of interest in these studies are based on two fundamental parameters : the nodes _ degrees _",
    "( i.e. , the number of edges incident to each node ) , and the _ distances _ between pairs of nodes ( as measured by shortest - path length ) .",
    "the node - to - node distances are often studied in terms of the _ diameter _  the maximum distance  and a set of closely related but more robust quantities including the average distance among pairs and the _ effective diameter _ ( the 90th percentile distance , a smoothed form of which we use for our studies ) .",
    "almost all large real - world networks evolve over time by the addition and deletion of nodes and edges .",
    "most of the recent models of network evolution capture the growth process in a way that incorporates two pieces of `` conventional wisdom : ''    * _ constant average degree assumption _ : the average node degree in the network remains constant over time .",
    "( or equivalently , the number of edges grows linearly in the number of nodes . ) * _ slowly growing diameter assumption _ : the diameter is a slowly growing function of the network size , as in `` small world '' graphs @xcite .",
    "for example , the intensively - studied _ preferential attachment model _",
    "@xcite posits a network in which each new node , when it arrives , attaches to the existing network by a constant number of out - links , according to a `` rich - get - richer '' rule .",
    "recent work has given tight asymptotic bounds on the diameter of preferential attachment networks  @xcite ; depending on the precise model , these bounds grow logarithmically  @xcite or even slower than logarithmically in the number of nodes",
    ".    how are assumptions ( a ) and ( b ) reflected in data on network growth ? empirical studies of large networks to date have mainly focused on _ static _",
    "graphs , identifying properties of a single snapshot or a very small number of snapshots of a large network .",
    "for example , despite the intense interest in the web s link structure , the recent work of ntoulas et al .",
    "@xcite noted the lack of prior empirical research on the evolution of the web .",
    "thus , while one can assert based on these studies that , qualitatively , real networks have relatively small average node degrees and diameters , it has not been clear how to convert these into statements about trends over time .    [ [ the - present - work - densification - laws - and - shrinking - diameters ] ] * the present work : densification laws and shrinking diameters * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    here we study a range of different networks , from several domains , and we focus specifically on the way in which fundamental network properties vary with time .",
    "we find , based on the growth patterns of these networks , that principles ( a ) and ( b ) need to be reassessed .",
    "specifically , we show the following for a broad range of networks across diverse domains .",
    "* _ empirical observation : densification power laws _ : the networks are becoming _ denser _ over time , with the average degree increasing ( and hence with the number of edges growing super - linearly in the number of nodes ) .",
    "moreover , the densification follows a power - law pattern . *",
    "_ empirical observation : shrinking diameters : _ the effective diameter is , in many cases , actually _ decreasing _ as the network grows .",
    "we view the second of these findings as particularly surprising : rather than shedding light on the long - running debate over exactly how slowly the graph diameter",
    "_ grows _ as a function of the number of nodes , it suggests a need to revisit standard models so as to produce graphs in which the effective diameter is capable of actually _ shrinking _ over time .",
    "we also note that , while densification and decreasing diameters are properties that are intuitively consistent with one another ( and are both borne out in the datasets we study ) , they are qualitatively distinct in the sense that it is possible to construct examples of graphs evolving over time that exhibit one of these properties but not the other",
    ".    we can further sharpen the quantitative aspects of these findings .",
    "in particular , the densification of these graphs , as suggested by ( @xmath2 ) , is not arbitrary ; we find that as the graphs evolve over time , they follow a version of the relation @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the number of edges and nodes of the graph at time @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is an exponent that generally lies strictly between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we refer to such a relation as a _ densification power law _ , or _",
    "growth power law_. ( exponent @xmath10 corresponds to constant average degree over time , while @xmath11 corresponds to an extremely dense graph where each node has , on average , edges to a constant fraction of all nodes . )",
    "what underlying process causes a graph to systematically densify , with a fixed exponent as in equation ( [ eq : gpl ] ) , and to experience a decrease in effective diameter even as its size increases ?",
    "this question motivates the second main contribution of this work : we present two families of probabilistic generative models for graphs that capture aspects of these properties .",
    "the first model , which we refer to as _ community guided attachment  _ ( cga )  @xcite , argues that graph densification can have a simple underlying basis ; it is based on a decomposition of the nodes into a nested set of communities , such that the difficulty of forming links between communities increases with the community size . for this model ,",
    "we obtain rigorous results showing that a natural tunable parameter in the model can lead to a densification power law with any desired exponent @xmath7 . the second model , which is more sophisticated , exhibits both densification and a decreasing effective diameter as it grows .",
    "this model , which we refer to as the _ forest fire model _ , is based on having new nodes attach to the network by `` burning '' through existing edges in epidemic fashion .",
    "the mathematical analysis of this model appears to lead to novel questions about random graphs that are quite complex , but through simulation we find that for a range of parameter values the model exhibits realistic behavior in densification , distances , and degree distributions .",
    "it is thus the first model , to our knowledge , that exhibits this full set of desired properties .",
    "accurate properties of network growth , together with models supporting them , have implications in several contexts .",
    "* _ graph generation : _ our findings form means for assessing the quality of graph generators .",
    "synthetic graphs are important for ` what if ' scenarios , for extrapolations , and for simulations , when real graphs are impossible to collect ( like , _",
    "e.g. _ , a very large friendship graph between people ) . *",
    "_ graph sampling : _ datasets consisting of huge real - world graphs are increasingly available , with sizes ranging from the millions to billions of nodes .",
    "there are many known algorithms to compute interesting measures ( shortest paths , centrality , betweenness , etc . ) , but most of these algorithms become impractical for large graphs .",
    "thus sampling is essential  but sampling from a graph is a non - trivial problem since the goal is to maintain structural properties of the network .",
    "densification laws can help discard bad sampling methods , by providing means to reject sampled subgraphs .",
    "+ a recent work of leskovec and faloutsos  @xcite proposed two views on sampling from large graphs . for _ back - in - time _ sampling the goal is to find a sequence of sampled subgraphs that matches the evolution of the original graph and thus obey the temporal growth patterns . on the other hand , _ scale - down _ sampling aims for a sample that matches the properties of the original large graph .",
    "the authors considered various sampling strategies , propose evaluation techniques , and use the temporal graph patterns presented in this paper to evaluate the quality of the sampled subgraphs . *",
    "_ extrapolations : _ for several real graphs , we have a lot of snapshots of their past .",
    "what can we say about their future ? our results help form a basis for validating scenarios for graph evolution .",
    "* _ abnormality detection and computer network management : _ in many network settings , `` normal '' behavior will produce subgraphs that obey densification laws ( with a predictable exponent ) and other properties of network growth .",
    "if we detect activity producing structures that deviate significantly from this , we can flag it as an abnormality ; this can potentially help with the detection of _",
    "e.g. _ fraud , spam , or distributed denial of service ( ddos ) attacks .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : related ] surveys the related work .",
    "section  [ sec : observations ] gives our empirical findings on real - world networks across diverse domains .",
    "section  [ sec : explanations ] describes our proposed models and gives results obtained both through analysis and simulation .",
    "section  [ sec : ddovertm ] gives the formal and experimental analysis of the relationship between the degree distribution and the graph densification over time .",
    "we conclude and discuss the implications of our findings in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "research over the past few years has identified classes of properties that many real - world networks obey .",
    "one of the main areas of focus has been on _ degree power laws _ , showing that the set of node degrees has a heavy - tailed distribution .",
    "such degree distributions have been identified in phone call graphs  @xcite , the internet @xcite , the web  @xcite , click - stream data  @xcite and for a who - trusts - whom social network  @xcite .",
    "other properties include the `` small - world phenomenon , '' popularly known as `` six degrees of separation '' , which states that real graphs have surprisingly small ( average or effective ) diameter ( see  @xcite ) .    in parallel with empirical studies of large networks ,",
    "there has been considerable work on probabilistic models for graph generation .",
    "the discovery of degree power laws led to the development of random graph models that exhibited such degree distributions , including the family of models based on _ preferential attachment _",
    "@xcite , _ copying model _",
    "@xcite , and the related _ growing network with redirection _",
    "model  @xcite , which produces graphs with constant diameter and _ logarithmically _ increasing average degree  @xcite .",
    "similar to our forest fire model is the work of vazquez  @xcite where ideas based on random walks and recursive search for generating networks were introduced . in a random walk model",
    "the walk starts at a random node , follows links , and for each visited node with some probability an edge is created between the visited node and the new node .",
    "it can be shown that such model will generate graphs with power - law degree distribution with exponent @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand , in the recursive search model first a new node is added to the network , and the edge to a random node is created .",
    "if an edge is created to a node in the network , then with some probability @xmath13 an edge is also created to each of its 1-hop neighbors .",
    "this rule is recursively applied until no edges are created .",
    "the recursive search model is similar to our forest fire model in a sense that it exploits current network structure to create new edges .",
    "however , there is an important difference that in recursive search model the average degree scales at most _ logarithmically _ ( and not as a power - law ) with the number of nodes in the network .",
    "our simulation experiments also indicated that the diameter of networks generated by the recursive search does not decrease over time , but it either slowly increases or remains constant .",
    "we point the reader to  @xcite for overviews of this area .",
    "recent work of chakrabarti and faloutsos  @xcite gives a survey of the properties of real world graphs and the underlying generative models for graphs .",
    "it is important to note the fundamental contrast between one of our main findings here  that the average number of out - links per node is growing polynomially in the network size  and body of work on degree power laws .",
    "this earlier work developed models that almost exclusively used the assumption of node degrees that were bounded by constants ( or at most logarithmic functions ) as the network grew ; our findings and associated model challenge this assumption , by showing that networks across a number of domains are becoming _ denser _ over time .",
    "dorogovtsev and mendes in a series of works  @xcite analyzed possible scenarios of nonlinearly growing networks while maintaining scale - free structure . among considered hypothetical scenarios were also those where the number of links grows polynomially with the number of edges , i.e. densification power law , while maintaining power - law degree distribution .",
    "the authors call this an _ accelerated growth _ and propose preferential attachment type models where densification is forced by introducing an additional `` node attractiveness '' factor that is not only degree - dependent but also time - dependent .",
    "the motivation for their work comes from the fact that authors  @xcite reported the increase of the average degree over time on the web and the internet .",
    "our work here differs in that it presents measurements on many time evolving networks to support our findings , and proposes generative models where densification is an emerging property of the model .",
    "besides densification we also address the shrinking diameters and consider models for generating them .",
    "the bulk of prior work on the empirical study of network datasets has focused on _ static _",
    "graphs , identifying patterns in a single snapshot , or a small number of network snapshots ( see also the discussion of this point by ntoulas et al .",
    "two exceptions are the very recent work of katz  @xcite , who independently discovered densification power laws for citation networks , and the work of redner  @xcite , who studied the evolution of the citation graph of _ physical review _ over the past century .",
    "katz s work builds on his earlier research on power - law relationships between the size and the recognition of professional communities  @xcite ; his work on densification is focused specifically on citations , and he does not propose a generative network model to account for the densification phenomenon , as we do here .",
    "redner s work focuses on a range of citation patterns over time which are different from the network properties we study here .",
    "our community guided attachment  ( cga ) model , which produces densifying graphs , is an example of a hierarchical graph generation model , in which the linkage probability between nodes decreases as a function of their relative distance in the hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "again , there is a distinction between the aims of this past work and our model here ; where these earlier network models were seeking to capture properties of individual snapshots of a graph , we seek to explain a time evolution process in which one of the fundamental parameters , the average node degree , is varying as the process unfolds .",
    "our forest fire model follows the overall framework of earlier graph models in which nodes arrive one at a time and link into the existing structure ; like the copying model discussed above , for example , a new node creates links by consulting the links of existing nodes . however , the recursive process by which nodes in the forest fire model creates these links is quite different , leading to the new properties discussed in the previous section .",
    "this paper extends the work of  @xcite by introducing new measurements and analysis of the evolution of degree distribution and its connection to densification power law . in a follow - up paper  @xcite we introduced _ kronecker graphs _ , a mathematically tractable model of graph growth and evolution .",
    "kronecker graphs are based on tensor products of graph adjacency matrices , and exhibit a full set of static and temporal graph properties .",
    "the emphasis of the work on kronecker graphs is on the ability to prove theorems about their properties , and not to provide simple generative models , like our forest fire model , that intrinsically lead to densification and shrinking diameter .",
    "we study the temporal evolution of several networks , by observing snapshots of these networks taken at regularly spaced points in time .",
    "we use datasets from seven different sources ; for each , we have information about the time when each node was added to the network over a period of several years  this enables the construction of a snapshot at any desired point in time . for each of datasets",
    ", we find a version of the densification power law from equation  ( [ eq : gpl ] ) , @xmath14 ; the exponent @xmath7 differs across datasets , but remains remarkably stable over time .",
    "we also find that the effective diameter decreases in all the datasets considered .",
    "the datasets consist of two citation graphs for different areas in the physics literature , a citation graph for u.s .",
    "patents , a graph of the internet , five bipartite affiliation graphs of authors with papers they authored , a recommendation network , and an email communication network .",
    "overall , then , we consider 12 different datasets from 7 different sources .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig : rankdeg ] further investigates the degree distribution of the email and hep  ph networks .",
    "we use the same data as in figures  [ fig : emailddcf](a ) and  [ fig : hepphddcf](a ) , and plot the number of nodes of a certain degree against the rank .",
    "the solid lines present the power - law decay with exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the actual slope of the plotted line is @xmath17 , which is the relation between the power - law exponent @xmath18 and the slope of the rank degree plot ( see  @xcite for more details on these relationships ) .    in both plots of figure  [ fig : rankdeg ]",
    "we observe linearity which suggests a power - law relationship for a part of the degree distribution . for the email network",
    "we observe linearity in the tail , and for the hep  ph citation network in the first part of the distribution .",
    "these two plots show that in our two datasets the power - law degree distribution does not hold for the entire range .",
    "however , we still observe a significant range where power - law relationship seems to hold .",
    "regardless of these irregularities there is still very good agreement of the data with the results of theorems  [ th : dpldd ] and  [ th : dplddvstm ] , which suggests that there exists graphs that densify by maintaining constant power law degree exponent ( theorem  [ th : dpldd ] ) , and also graphs that densify by degree exponent flattening over time ( theorem  [ th : dplddvstm ] ) .",
    "despite the enormous recent interest in large - scale network data , and the range of interesting patterns identified for static snapshots of graphs ( e.g. heavy - tailed distributions , small - world phenomena ) , there has been relatively little work on the properties of the time evolution of real graphs .",
    "this is exactly the focus of this work .",
    "the main findings and contributions follow :    * the densification power law : in contrast to the standard modeling assumption that the average out - degree remains constant over time , we discover that real graphs have out - degrees that grow over time , following a natural pattern ( eq .  ( [ eq : gpl ] ) ) . * shrinking diameters : our experiments also show that the standard assumption of slowly growing diameters does not hold in a range of real networks ; rather , the diameter may actually exhibit a gradual decrease as the network grows . *",
    "we show that our community guided attachment  model leads to the densification power law , and that it needs only one parameter to achieve it .",
    "* we give the forest fire model , based on only two parameters , which is able to capture patterns observed both in previous work and in the current study : heavy - tailed in- and out - degrees , the densification power law , and a shrinking diameter .",
    "* we notice that the forest fire model exhibits a sharp transition between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying .",
    "graphs with decreasing effective diameter are generated around this transition point .",
    "* finally , we find a fundamental relation between the temporal evolution of the graph s power - law degree distribution and the densification power law  exponent .",
    "we also observe that real datasets exhibit this type of relation .",
    "our work here began with an investigation of the time - evolution of a set of large real - world graphs across diverse domains .",
    "it resulted in the finding that real - world graphs are becoming denser as they grow , and that in many cases their effective diameters are decreasing .",
    "this challenges some of the dominant assumptions in recent work on random graph models , which assumes constant ( or at most logarithmic ) node degrees , and diameters that increase slowly in the number of nodes . building on these findings",
    ", we have proposed a set of simple graph generation processes , capable of producing graphs that exhibit densification and exhibit decreasing effective diameter .",
    "our results have potential relevance in multiple settings , including what if scenarios ; in forecasting of future parameters of computer and social networks ; in anomaly detection on monitored graphs ; in designing graph sampling algorithms ; and in realistic graph generators .",
