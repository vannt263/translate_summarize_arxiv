    "the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) provides a mechanism to couple the charge and spin of electrons .",
    "a prominent example is the spin hall effect ( she ) , i.e. the soc - induced pure spin current transverse to an applied charge current @xcite . in bilayers of a normal metal ( n : a non - magnetically ordered metal ) and a ferromagnet ( f , which includes   in the present context ) ,",
    "the magnetization dynamics is affected by the she spin current via the spin - transfer torque @xcite that can be strong enough to switch the magnetization @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the inverse of the she ( ishe ) , i.e. , the pure spin current - driven transverse charge current , is a convenient tool to detect spin currents generated by spin pumping ( sp ) @xcite and the spin seebeck effect ( sse ) @xcite .",
    "quite some attention has been recently focused on ferromagnetic insulators ( fi ) such as yttrium iron garnet ( yig : y@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 ) that can be activated electrically and thermally by attached normal metal contacts .",
    "yig s very low magnetization damping makes it an attractive material for low - power spin - wave based interconnects and heat - harvesting devices @xcite .",
    "the magnetoresistance ( mr ) is the ratio of the electrical resistance of a material with and without an applied magnetic field @xcite . in ferromagnetic conductors",
    "the mr is often dominated by effects that are not caused directly by the applied magnetic field , but rather by the magnetization orientation as controlled by the applied field .",
    "the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) , for example , refers to the phenomenon that the electrical resistance of ferromagnets depends on the angle between the current and magnetization directions @xcite . for applications in magnetic field sensors and data storage devices ,",
    "the amr has been superseded by the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) @xcite and tunneling magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "this review addresses a new type of mr discovered in a bilayer made of a metal n with strong soc ( usually platinum ) and an fi ( usually yig ) , where the electrical resistance was found to depend on the magnetization of the fi @xcite .",
    "since it can be explained by the simultaneous action of the she and ishe @xcite , it has been dubbed spin hall magnetoresistance ( smr ) .",
    "this mechanism is similar to that of the predicted magnetoresistance of the two - dimensional electron gas induced by magnetic field - induced decoherence of an edge spin accumulation @xcite ( the related hanle effect  was observed recently in pt films under large magnetic fields @xcite ) .",
    "the smr can be used to electrically measure the magnetization direction of an insulator @xcite and helps to non - invasively access fundamental transport parameters such as the spin hall angle , spin diffusion length , and spin - transfer torque ( spin - mixing conductance ) at an n@xmath3fi interface @xcite .",
    "the smr originates from the simultaneous action of two effects , viz .",
    "the she and ishe , that both made an impact on modern spintronics .",
    "the she causes current - induced spin - transfer torques without a polarizing ferromagnet ( spin - orbit torques ) while the ishe has become a standard method of detecting spin currents .",
    "however , controversial issues remain , such as the magnetic proximity effect and the rashba soc at the n@xmath3fi interface , challenging the applications mentioned above , but also our understanding of phenomena such as the spin seebeck effect .",
    "the smr in n@xmath3fi bilayers is arguably the most simple observable to detect socs : it exists in bilayers of well - studied and characterized materials , and is a strictly linear response effect .",
    "hence , it is essential to understand the smr before more complicated ones that involve complex devices , difficult materials , magnetization dynamics , noise or non - linearitis .",
    "many groups have theoretically and experimentally studied the smr since its discovery .",
    "hence we believe that the time has come to consolidate the existing knowledge .",
    "this review is organized as follows : in section  [ materials ] , we introduce the basic concepts and prevalent materials necessary to understand and observe the smr . in section",
    "[ theory ] , we describe the diffusion theory for the ( i)she with quantum mechanical boundary conditions at interfaces",
    ". experiments by various groups are discussed in section  [ comparison ] as well as the parameters obtained by fitting the theory . in section  [ issues ] , we address controversial issues such as magnetic proximity and rashba soc at interfaces .",
    "smr - related new developments are reviewed in section  [ developments ] .",
    "we present conclusions and an outlook in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this chapter we review briefly pertinent basic notions in spintronics and magnetism that are used in the subsequent discussions .",
    "it starts with metallic ferromagnets that have been subject of transport studies for almost two centuries .",
    "phenomena driven by the soc in metallic ferromagnets such as the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) and the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) are still not fully understood .",
    "the spin hall effect , i.e. the analogue of the ahe in nonmagnetic metals , has a much shorter history . its potential to convert the flows of charge and spin has inspired the whole spintronics community .",
    "multilayers made of metallic ferromagnets and nonmagnetic metals are known to display the gmr and tmr as well as spin - transfer torques mediated by the exchange interaction .",
    "more recently , soc induced spin - transfer torques have been the center of interest .",
    "here we introduce a few of these notions as background to the system and phenomenon of interest , i.e. the smr in n@xmath3fi bilayers .",
    "metallic ferromagnets , especially the @xmath4 transitions metals and their alloys , are important in magnetoelectronics due to their high conductivities and curie temperatures .",
    "their magnetization is therefore ideal for non - volatile information storage and electrical readout .",
    "the band structure in a ferromagnet is spin - dependent , as are its transport properties that are well described by a two parallel current model for majority and minority spins . introducing the spin - dependent conductivity @xmath5",
    "( @xmath6 ) , an electric field induces the charge current @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total conductivity .",
    "an applied charge current is accompanied by a spin current @xcite @xmath9 with conductance spin polarization @xmath10 the spin dependence of transport is not easily observed in bulk ferromagnets directly .",
    "the  magnetoresistance , i.e. the dependence of the electrical resistance on an applied magnetic field exists even for normal metals without soc through the lorentz force @xcite .",
    "the amr , i.e. the phenomenon that the electric resistance depends on the angle between the electric current and the magnetization vectors , is observed in metallic ferromagnets @xcite . when current and magnetization direction are given by unit vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the electric resistance in an isotropic ( or cubic ) material reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) the resistivity for magnetization parallel ( transverse ) to the applied current , and @xmath17 is an averaged value over all directions for which different definitions can be found in the literature , for example , as @xmath18 @xcite . a corollary of the amr  is the transverse resistivity @xmath19 also referred to as planar hall effect .",
    "with current direction along @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the cartesian @xmath23-component of the magnetization direction unit vector .",
    "higher order contributions to the amr are found in single - crystalline thin films @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", @xmath24 can be derived microscopically from the @xmath25-@xmath26 model with a free @xmath25-electron conduction band and localized @xmath26-electrons with a strong exchange interaction and weak soc . in this model",
    ", transport is carried by the conduction electrons with a contribution to the resistivity from scattering into localized @xmath26-states by impurities that depends on the magnetization direction owing to the soc .",
    "the amr has been of considerable interest as a tool to measure the magnetization direction electrically , thereby serving as a magnetic field sensor @xcite .",
    "it still attracts scientific attention nowadays @xcite , and new regimes are being opened by studies in ultrathin films @xcite .",
    "the  hall effect refers to the transverse charge current normal to both an applied current and external magnetic field and is named after its discoverer @xcite .",
    "the ahe , found by hall two years later @xcite , depends neither on the external magnetic field nor on the internal dipolar field , but is caused by the soc or magnetic orientational disorder ( which is generated by soc ) @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the applied charge current density and @xmath29 is the anomalous hall angle , i.e. the ratio between the transverse and longitudinal conductivities or the slope in plots of the anomalous hall conductivity as a function of the longitudinal one .",
    "controversies about the microscopic mechanism of the ahe , e.g. whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic , linger , but it appears to be generally accepted that the extrinsic skew scattering process dominates in the clean regime , while intrinsic band structure effects and/or extrinsic side jump scattering explain results for moderately good metals @xcite . the anomalous hall effect can be interpreted in terms of the spin hall effect discussed hereafter : in ferromagnets a spin polarized current is converted into a transverse charge current or voltage by the spin - dependent conductances as parameterized by the polarization @xmath30 .      in normal metals",
    "without magnetic order , electrons with spin up and spin down are degenerate and contribute to transport as two channels in parallel .",
    "nevertheless , significant soc causes an analogue of the ahe known as the spin hall effect ( she ) , by which a charge current generates a pure transverse spin current , i.e. , a current of spin angular momentum @xcite . while a spin accumulation can be detected by optical methods at lease in some systems @xcite , we are not aware of experiments that can measure a spin current directly . however , onsager reciprocity demands that an inverse she ( ishe ) exists , implying that a spin current drives an easily detectable transverse charge current or voltage @xcite .",

    "@xmath35 is the charge current driven by an @xmath23-polarized spin current in @xmath36 direction .",
    "note that we define spin currents in units of ampere ; they can be converted to angular momentum currents by the factor @xmath37 .",
    "modern crystal growth techniques allow controlled fabrication of multilayers from various materials with individual film thicknesses of only a few monolayers .",
    "this led to the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) in the current - in - plane ( cip ) configuration , i.e. , the difference of electric conductivity between parallel and anti - parallel ( magnetic ) configurations in the layered structures @xcite .",
    "this effect has been explained by the spin - dependent scattering of electrons at n@xmath3f interfaces : in the anti - parallel configuration both spin species are scattered strongly at opposite interfaces .",
    "when an applied magnetic field forces a parallel configuration one spin channel is short - circuited , leading to a reduced resistance @xcite .",
    "the gmr in the current perpendicular to plane ( cpp ) configuration is often larger @xcite and easy to model by one - dimensional spin diffusion theory @xcite .",
    "the essential quantity is here the distributed difference between the effective chemical potentials of electrons with opposite spins or spin accumulation .",
    "the transfer of spin angular momentum between magnetic layers by an applied current , i.e. , the spin - transfer torque , was predicted @xcite and observed @xcite in cpp spin valve structures .",
    "magnetoelectronic circuit theory for magnetic heterostructures with non - collinear magnetizations provides a theoretical basis to understand the material dependence of these effects @xcite . by scattering theory ,",

    "n@xmath3f bilayers with an insulating ferromagnet f can be activated electrically by means of the she @xcite , while the ishe can be used to detect magnetization dynamics @xcite .",

    "<S> we review the so - called spin hall magnetoresistance ( smr ) in bilayers of a magnetic insulator and a metal , in which spin currents are generated in the normal metal by the spin hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> the associated angular momentum transfer to the ferromagnetic layer and thereby the electrical resistance is modulated by the angle between the applied current and the magnetization direction . </S>",
    "<S> the smr provides a convenient tool to non - invasively measure the magnetization direction and spin - transfer torque to an insulator . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the minimal theoretical instruments to calculate the smr , i.e. spin diffusion theory and quantum mechanical boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a small set of parameters that can be fitted to experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the limitations of the theory as well as alternative mechanisms such as the ferromagnetic proximity effect and rashba spin - orbit torques , and point out new developments .    </S>",
