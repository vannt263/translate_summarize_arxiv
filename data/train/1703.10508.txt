    "lattice gauge theory at very high temperatures and/or baryon densities predicts an interesting window onto the properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in guise of a new phase , quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which pervaded the early universe , and may be present in the core of neutron stars . to realize this predicted phase , current experimental program of ultra relativistic heavy ion collisions ( urhic )",
    "have been designed at different colliders with different center of mass energies , _ viz . _",
    "relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) at @xmath11= 200 gev per nucleon in au + au collisions and large hadron collider ( lhc ) at european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) at @xmath11= 2.76 tev per nucleon in pb + pb collisions .",
    "recent analysis suggests that the events of urhic should be analyzed by incorporating the effect of magnetic field because an intensely strong magnetic field , perpendicular to the reaction plane , is expected to be produced at very early stages of collisions when the event is off - central @xcite .",
    "depending on the centrality , the strength of the magnetic field may reach between @xmath12 ( @xmath13 gauss ) at rhic @xcite to 10 @xmath12 at lhc @xcite . at extreme cases",
    "it may reach values of 50 @xmath12 .",
    "a very strong magnetic field ( @xmath14  gauss ) was also produced in the early universe during the electroweak phase transition due to the gradients in higgs field .",
    "ultimately such strong magnetic field might significantly affect the production of particle and its dynamics at very early stage of the collisions .",
    "since magnetic field induces an anisotropy to the momentum of the affected particles , we might expect it to affect the anisotropic flow of the particles .",
    "heavy quark pairs ( @xmath15 ) are also produced during the very early stages of the collisions when the field strength is expected to be very strong .",
    "_ for example _ , charm - anti charm ( @xmath16 ) pairs are produced at a typical time of @xmath17 fm whereas the magnetic field is expected to be very strong typically up to @xmath18 fm @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that depending on the conductivity of the medium , the magnetic field produced may still remain substantial for significantly longer time @xcite .",
    "thus it becomes reasonable to assume that charmonium production may get significantly influenced by the magnetic field .",
    "the same argument applies to the bottomonium production . a large number of studies on the in - medium properties of @xmath15 bound states has been carried out using the phenomenological potential models @xcite , where the effects of the medium are encoded in a temperature dependent potential with non perturbative inputs from the lattice simulations .",
    "the derivation of such models was however not established from the underlying theory , qcd .",
    "however , lattice calculations of free energies and other quantities @xcite obtained from the correlation functions of polyakov loop are often taken as input for the potential .",
    "although these quantities have been thought to be related to the color - singlet and color - octet heavy quark potentials at finite temperature , a precise answer is still missing @xcite .",
    "recently quarkonia at finite temperature has been studied by taking the advantage of the hierarchies between the non - relativistic scales associated with quarkonia and the thermal energy scales characterizing the system through the effective field theories , _ viz .",
    "nrqcd , pnrqcd _",
    "the in - medium modifications of the quarkonium states can be studied from the first principle of qcd by the spectral functions  @xcite but the reconstruction of the spectral function from the lattice meson correlators turns out to be very difficult .",
    "recently one of us explored the properties of quarkonia states in a hot medium by correcting both the perturbative and non perturbative terms of the @xmath15 potential through the dielectric function in real - time formalism  @xcite in both isotropic as well as anisotropic hot qcd medium , arising at the very early stages of the collisions  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , magnetic field is also produced at the early stages of the collisions thus it becomes worthwhile to examine the effects of magnetic field on the properties of quarkonia bound states in the above framework and subsequently on its yields . for that purpose",
    "we will first calculate the gluon self - energy in a background ( heat bath ) medium in the presence of a static homogeneous magnetic field , and then calculate the interquark potential between @xmath0 and @xmath1 by the static limit of the effective gluon propagator to see the effects of magnetic field on the quarkonium states in a thermal medium .",
    "our work is arranged in the following way : in subsection 2.1 we will discuss the quark propagator at finite temperature in strong magnetic field approximation ( smfa ) . in subsection 2.2 we will calculate the gluon self energy at finite temperature in presence of strong magnetic field . in next subsection 2.3",
    "we will compute the screening mass in smfa by taking the static limit of gluon - self energy . in section 3",
    ", we will obtain the potential from the static limit of the effective propagator and explore how the properties of quarkonia could be affected by the presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "finally we will conclude in section 4 .",
    "quantum mechanically both the quarkonium and heavy meson spectra have been analyzed in both the three - dimensional harmonic potential and cornell potential with an additional spin - spin interaction term @xcite .",
    "moreover the possible anisotropies emerging in the static quark - anti quark potential is also explored in @xcite .",
    "schwinger first obtained the fermionic propagator in coordinate space @xcite and then tsai has obtained the same in momentum space and used it to calculate the vacuum polarization in magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the vacuum polarization tensor has also been obtained in a gauge invariant manner for both strong and weak magnetic field limit @xcite .",
    "we are now going to extend these propagators to qcd to calculate the gluon self - energy , which will in turn help to study the properties of quarkonia quantum field theoretically in the presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume the magnetic field to be constant and homogeneous .",
    "we also assume the magnetic field to be along @xmath19-direction and of magnitude @xmath20",
    ". such a magnetic field can be obtained from a vector potential @xmath21 .",
    "the choice of vector potential is not unique as the same magnetic field can also be obtained from a symmetric potential given by @xmath22 . using the proper - time method formulated by schwinger , the fermion propagator in such a magnetic field can be written in the coordinate space as @xcite @xmath23 where the the phase factor , @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 which becomes unity for a closed fermion loop with two fermion lines , i.e , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "+ however , the same propagator was first calculated by @xcite in the momentum space as @xmath27 } \\left[\\left\\lbrace\\cos(s ) + \\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2 }   \\sin(s)\\right\\rbrace(m+\\gamma\\cdot p_{\\| } ) -\\frac{\\gamma\\cdot p_{\\bot}}{\\cos ( s)}\\right ] , \\label{sch_mom}\\ ] ]    the propagator ( [ sch_mom ] ) in the momentum space can also be expressed in a more convenient way using the associated laguerre polynomials ( @xmath28 ) @xmath29 where the following quantities are defined as @xcite @xmath30 the order of the laguerre polynomial also corresponds to the number of energy eigenvalues in a magnetic field , known as landau levels .",
    "in strong magnetic field approximation ( smfa ) ( @xmath31 ) the particles occupy the lowest landau level ( lll ) ( @xmath32 ) only , thus , in smfa , the fermion propagator in eq.([prop_lag ] ) reduces to the following form @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the mass and electric charge of the fermion , respectively .      in thermal medium ,",
    "the system in weak coupling regime possesses additional scales , _ viz .",
    "_ t , @xmath36 etc .",
    ", in addition to the masses of partons ( quarks ) .",

    "they are explicitly given by @xmath60    we will now calculate the vacuum term for the gluon self - energy .      the vacuum term in strong magnetic field can be calculated easily as it is similar to the calculation of self energy in vacuum without magnetic field except the fact that the dimension of the momentum integration is now reduced from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath105 therefore , eq.([h ] ) gives the very simple form for the square of the debye mass for massless quarks , which is already derived in refs.@xcite @xmath106 it shows that @xmath107 increases linearly with the magnetic field and is independent of temperature , thus the collective behavior of the medium gets strongly affected by the presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "however , for physical quark masses , the debye mass is given by from eq.([g ] ) @xmath108 which depends on both magnetic field and temperature .",
    "however , @xmath107 depends strongly on the magnetic field and depends very slowly on the temperature and becomes temperature - independent beyond a certain temperature .",
    "for example , for @xmath109 and @xmath110 , @xmath107 becomes temperature independent beyond t=180 mev and 280 mev , respectively .",
    "thus , to see the variation of the debye masses with the strong magnetic field , we have numerically calculated @xmath107 as a function of @xmath111 ( in units of @xmath5 ) for the temperature range t=150 - 550 mev in fig.1-a and noticed that for smaller temperature ( 150 mev ) , @xmath107 is almost linearly increasing with @xmath111 and for higher temperatures ( 350 - 500 mev ) , @xmath107 deviates slightly from the linearly increasing trend and increases very little at higher @xmath111 s .    in strong magnetic field approximation ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 )",
    ", the medium with massless quarks possesses only one scale available related to the magnetic field ( @xmath111 ) so by the dimensional arguments the square of the debye mass is linear in @xmath111 whereas for the the medium with physical quark masses , even in smfa there is a weak competition between the dominant scale , @xmath111 and much weaker scales , mass ( m ) and temperature ( t ) ( rather their ratio , @xmath112 ) in the form of boltzmann damping factor ( @xmath113 ) as in eq.([md ] ) .",
    "this is seen in fig.1-b , where a comparison of debye masses with and without incorporating the quarks masses is made .",
    "to see the temperature dependence of the debye mass explicitly we have plotted @xmath114 with the temperature directly with increasing values of @xmath109 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 in fig.2 , where a decreasing trend is found in the region of smaller temperature and higher magnetic field .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]          in this section",
    ", we shall discuss the dissociation of charmonium and bottomonium states due to an external strong magnetic field in a hot qcd medium .",
    "the concept of dissociation temperature becomes irrelevant here because the scale at which the collective oscillations develop depends only on the magnetic field albeit we are considering a hot qcd medium because in strong magnetic field approximation ( @xmath117 ) , the scale at which the collective oscillation sets in is associated with magnetic field only because @xmath111 is the most dominant scale in strong magnetic field limit ( if the partons are assumed massless ) , not the thermally generated scales .",
    "this in turn makes the potential to depend only on the magnetic field through the dependence of debye mass on the magnetic field .",
    "thus , it makes sense here to discuss the dissociation of quarkonium states due to the magnetic field only as far as smfa is valid .    as we know that in the presence of medium , the potential between a heavy quark ( @xmath0 ) and its anti - quark ( @xmath1 ) will be screened , as a result if the screening is strong enough , the potential becomes too weak to form the resonance .",
    "thus we can argue that the quarkonium states will be dissolved in a medium if the debye screening radius , @xmath118 ( = @xmath119 ) in a given medium is smaller than the bound state radius of a particular resonance state then the medium inhibits the formation of the particular resonance and @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be dissolved into the medium . since the screening mass in strong magnetic field increases with the magnetic field therefore the ( critical ) magnetic field",
    "at which the @xmath15 potential becomes too feeble to hold @xmath15 together becomes smaller for the excited states .",
    "we can thus estimate the lower limit of critical magnetic field for various charmonium and bottomonium states by the criteria : @xmath120 , i.e. , for magnetic field larger than @xmath121 , the @xmath122-th quarkonium states cease to exist .",
    "for example , @xmath3 will be dissociated at @xmath123 and its excited state , @xmath7 is dissociated at smaller magnetic field @xmath9 whereas @xmath6 will be dissociated at @xmath124 and @xmath8 is dissociated at smaller magnetic field @xmath125 .",
    "to understand the in - medium properties of the quarkonium states quantitatively , one need to solve the schrdinger equation with the medium - modified potential , @xmath126 .",
    "there are some numerical methods to solve the schrdinger equation either in partial differential form ( time - dependent ) or eigen value form ( time - independent ) by the finite difference time domain method ( fdtd ) or matrix method , respectively . in the later method",
    ", the stationary schrdinger equation can be solved in a matrix form through a discrete basis , instead of the continuous real - space position basis spanned by the states @xmath127 . here the confining potential v is subdivided into n discrete wells with potentials @xmath128 such that for @xmath129 boundary potential , @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "therefore for the existence of a bound state , there must be exponentially decaying wave function in the region @xmath132 as @xmath133 and has the form : @xmath134 + q_{{}_e } \\exp [ \\gamma_{{}_{n+2}}(x - x_{n+1 } ) ] , \\ ] ] where , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and , @xmath137 .",
    "the eigenvalues can be obtained by identifying the zeros of @xmath138 . using this method ,",
    "we have found that @xmath3 and @xmath6 is dissociated at @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "though the dissociation magnetic fields , obtained from the two different methods apparently look different , its easy to see that qualitatively they are similar . using both methods , we found that the dissociation magnetic field for @xmath6 is roughly an order of magnitude greater than the dissociation magnetic field for @xmath3 . even though their absolute value obtained from the two different methods",
    "differ , they lie in the same ball park , which is @xmath141 10 @xmath5 for @xmath3 and @xmath141 100 @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "in this article , we have explored the effects of strong and homogeneous magnetic field on the properties of quarkonium states . for that purpose",
    "we have derived the potential between a heavy quark and its antiquark by the medium corrections to both coulomb and linear term of @xmath2 potential at t=0 , _ unlike the medium correction to the coulomb term alone_. although the medium considered is thermal but due to strong magnetic field approximation , all other scales present in the thermal medium becomes irrelevant as the scale related to magnetic field dominates over other .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the collective oscillation of the medium in the form of debye mass .",
    "in fact , the debye mass becomes completely independent of temperature for massless quarks and depends very weakly on temperature for massive quarks .",
    "however , beyond a certain temperature , the dependence is so weak that it is almost insignificant . as a result",
    "the heavy quark potential mainly depends on the magnetic field with a very feeble dependence on the temperature .",
    "this is expected as the effect of the medium on the potential enters through the debye mass .",
    "in particular the long distance part of the potential gets significantly affected , whereas the short distance part is mildly affected .",
    "we have then studied the dissociation of quarkonium states in a medium .",
    "since the potential in smfa depends mainly only on the magnetic field thus we have discussed the dissociation of quarkonium states due to the magnetic field only .",
    "we have estimated the critical value of magnetic field beyond which the resoanance does not form in two methods .",
    "the first one gives a lower limit of critical magnetic field for both charmonium and bottomonium states at which the debye screening radius becomes smaller than the bound state radius of a particular resonance state .",
    "the other one comes from the consideration of the binding energies of a specific state obtained from the energy eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation . in brief , @xmath3 is dissociated at @xmath4 10 @xmath5 and @xmath6 is dissociated at @xmath4 100 @xmath5 .",
    "we are thankful to aritra bandyopadhyay for a fruitful discussion during this work .",
    "bhaswar is thankful to the ministry of to human resource development , government of india for the financial assistance ."
