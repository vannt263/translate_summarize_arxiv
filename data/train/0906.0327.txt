    "a two point - contact interferometer @xcite is potentially a valuable probe of the topological properties of quantum hall states .",
    "if the observed state at @xmath0 @xcite were non - abelian @xcite , there would be a very dramatic signature in transport through a two point - contact interferometer @xcite . if there is an even number of charge @xmath1 quasiparticles in the interferometer , then aharonov - bohm oscillations of the current",
    "are observed as the area of the loop is varied , due to the interference between the two possible tunneling paths for current - carrying charge @xmath1 quasiparticles .",
    "if there is an odd number of quasiparticles in the loop , then these aharonov - bohm oscillations are not observed as a result of the non - abelian braiding of the current - carrying @xmath1 quasiparticles with those in the bulk .",
    "( however , aharonov - bohm oscillations with twice the period will still be observed due to the current carried by charge @xmath3",
    "quasiparticles @xcite . ) a recent experiment @xcite may have observed this predicted effect .    in this experiment ,",
    "a side gate is used to vary the area of the quantum hall droplet in the interferometer .",
    "the current oscillates as the area is varied .",
    "however , at certain values of the side gate voltage , the interference pattern changes dramatically . according to the non - abelian interferometry interpretation ,",
    "such a change occurs when the area is varied beyond a point at which one of the quasiparticles leaves the interference loop .",
    "then the @xmath1 quasiparticle number parity in the interference loop changes , leading to a striking change in the interference pattern .",
    "close to a transition point in the @xmath1 quasiparticle number parity , a quasiparticle comes close to the edge of the quantum hall droplet and begins to interact with the edge excitations .",
    "the leading coupling of the @xmath1 quasiparticle to the edge is through the ( resonant ) tunneling of majorana fermions from the edge to the zero mode on the @xmath1 quasiparticle .",
    "this coupling makes it possible for @xmath1 aharonov - bohm oscillations to be seen even when there is an odd number of quasiparticles in the interference loop . at an intuitive level , this can be understood in the following way . for odd quasiparticle number , a topological qubit straddles one of the point contacts and records when an @xmath1 quasiparticle takes that path ; consequently the two paths do not interfere and aharonov - bohm oscillations are not seen .",
    "this qubit is flipped when a majorana fermion tunnels from the edge to a bulk zero mode in the interference loop , thereby erasing the record and allowing quantum interference . over longer time scales , the topological qubit flips so many times that it can no longer carry any information .",
    "this eventually leads , at low energies and long time scales , to the absorption of the zero mode by the edge and , therefore , to the effective removal of this quasiparticle from the interference loop , as far as its non - abelian braiding properties are concerned .",
    "thus , _ every _ bulk quasiparticle will appear to be effectively absorbed by the edge if the interferometer is probed at sufficiently low voltages and temperatures  but ` sufficiently low ' will be exponentially small in the distance of the quasiparticle from the edge , as we will see .",
    "thus , the effect of bulk - edge coupling will only be apparent when the edge is close to a bulk @xmath1 quasiparticle . in this paper",
    ", we analyze this coupling in detail , as it effects the behavior of a two point - contact interferometer , with possible relevance to the transition regions of the experiments of refs .    in ref .",
    ", the coupling of a bulk @xmath1 quasiparticle to the edge was formulated in terms of perturbed boundary conformal field theory .",
    "it was shown that this problem could be mapped to a semi - infinite ising model in a boundary magnetic field .",
    "as we discuss below , the absence of @xmath1 quasiparticle interference for an odd number of bulk quasiparticles corresponds to the vanishing of the one - point function @xmath4 when the boundary magnetic field vanishes , while the appearance of @xmath1 quasiparticle interference for an even number of bulk quasiparticles corresponds to @xmath5 when the boundary magnetic field is infinite ( @xmath6 is the distance to the boundary of the ising model which is assumed , for simplicity , to be the @xmath7-axis ) .",
    "for finite boundary magnetic field , the boundary conditions of the ising model cross over from free to fixed , which corresponds to the absorption of a bulk quasiparticle .",
    "following the derivation of of the exact crossover function for the magnetization by chatterjee and zamolodchikov @xcite ( and of the full boundary state by chatterjee @xcite ) , we compute the current through the interferometer to lowest order in the backscattering at the point contacts , but treating the bulk - edge coupling _ exactly_. our results agree with lowest order perturbation theory in the bulk - edge coupling @xcite and numerical solution of a lattice model @xcite . when the point contacts are close together compared to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the majorana fermion edge velocity , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the source - drain voltage , the current - voltage relation takes a particularly simple form .",
    "when there is an even number of quasiparticles in the bulk , one of which is close to the edge , an interesting non - equilibrium problem presents itself : suppose the internal topological state of the bulk quasiparticles is fixed to an initial value ; what is its subsequent time evolution .",
    "this is considered elsewhere .",
    "we now set up the calculation of the backscattered current in a two point - contact interferometer to lowest order .",
    "the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian cases are conceptually similar , so we focus on the pfaffian for the sake of concreteness .",
    "the edge theory of the pfaffian state has a chiral bosonic charge mode and a chiral neutral majorana mode@xcite [ eqn : pf - edge ] l^r_pf(,)=_x(_t+v_c_x)+ i(_t+iv_n_x)both modes propagate to the right ( the left - moving version of this action , @xmath12 , has time - derivative terms with opposite sign ) , but will have different velocities in general .",

    "the action of the device is : [ eqn : pf - two - edges ] s_0 = dt dx ( l^r_pf(_1,_1 ) + l^l_pf(_2,_2 ) )     and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the interferometry area is changed by applying a voltage to gate @xmath29 .",
    "a bulk quasiparticle is coupled to the bottom edge by majorana fermion tunneling .",
    "this setup can be reformulated as two semi - infinite non - chiral edges or , equivalently , two semi - infinite ising models .",

    "it is also the most relevant backscattering operator in the renormalization group sense @xcite , so we will focus on it .",
    "since it is relevant , its effective value grows as the temperature is decreased , eventually leaving the weak backscattering regime .",

    "we have chosen a gauge in which the vector potential is concentrated at the second point contact so that @xmath37 enters only through the second term above .",
    "@xmath38 is the total electrical charge of the bulk quasiparticles , in units of @xmath1 ; @xmath39 is the majorana fermion number in the interference loop , modulo @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath41 terms in @xmath23 account for the diagonal ( in the fermion number basis ) effects of quasiparticle statistics .",
    "the product of right- and left - moving spin fields in ( [ eqn : backscat - op ] ) must be handled with some care to account for the fact that two charge @xmath1 quasiparticles ( one on each edge ) can fuse in two different ways .",
    "the effect of the non - abelian braiding statistics of the bulk quasiparticles enters in this way through the precise definition of @xmath42 .",
    "fortunately , this can be handled in a simple way in a calculation to lowest - order in the backscattering operator , as we will see in the next section .",
    "we now consider the coupling between a bulk quasiparticle and the edge .",
    "suppose that one of the bulk quasiparticles is close to the bottom edge , at @xmath43 with @xmath44 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : interfero ] .",
    "each bulk @xmath1 quasiparticle has a majorana fermion zero mode @xcite ; we will denote the zero mode associated with the @xmath1 quasiparticle close to the edge by @xmath45 .",
    "then , the leading coupling between the edge and this quasiparticle is of the form : @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the amplitude for a majorana fermion to tunnel from the edge to the zero mode @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the total action for a two - point contact interferometer with one or more quasiparticles in the interference loop , one of which is close to the bottom edge , is of the form @xmath48 however , this description is , at the moment , incomplete because we have not precisely defined the product of ising spin fields in @xmath49 .",
    "we will do this in the next section , but first we will give the appropriate kubo formulae for current through the interferometer .",
    "the current operator can be found from the commutator of the backscattering hamiltonian and the charge on one edge : @xmath50 to lowest order in perturbation theory , the backscattered current is found to be : [ current ] i(t ) = -i _ -^t dt 0 | [ i(t),h_(t)]|0 in principle , the current must be computed using a non - equilibrium technique , such as the schwinger - keldysh method , when the voltage is finite .",
    "however , at first order in the backscattering operators , there is no difference between the schwinger - keldysh expression and ( [ current ] ) .    at this order ,",
    "the current naturally breaks into the sum of three terms @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the backscattered currents for each point contact independently and , following chamon _",
    "et al._@xcite , we write the interference term in the form : @xmath53\\bigr)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 . and the imaginary part of the response function is @xmath55 @xmath56 is due to interference between the process in which a quasiparticle tunnels between the two edges at @xmath20 and the process in which it continues to @xmath20 and tunnels there . as a result , @xmath56 depends on the magnetic flux and the number of bulk quasiparticles between the two point contacts ; it reflects the non - abelian statistics of quasiparticles .",
    "this is implemented through the precise definition of the product of ising spin fields which appears in the backscattering operators , to which we turn in the next section .",
    "we now review the a few essential points in the discussion of inter - edge backscattering in refs . .",
    "in the chiral ising model , a pair of @xmath18s can fuse to either @xmath57 or @xmath58 ( or any linear combination of the two ) .",
    "consequently , when we consider the correlation function of a string of @xmath59 ( chiral ) @xmath18 fields at a single edge , there is not a unique answer but , instead , a vector space of @xmath60 _ conformal blocks _ which are defined by specifying the fusion channels of the @xmath18s ( e.g. by dividing them arbitrarily into @xmath61 pairs and specifying how each pair fuses ; different pairings lead to different bases in the vector space ) .    when a charge @xmath1 quasiparticle backscatters from one edge to another , a pair of @xmath18 quasiparticles is created , one in the non - abelian sector of each edge ( recall that a @xmath18 , which is the non - abelian part of an @xmath1 quasiparticle , is its own anti - particle ) .",
    "when there is only a single point contact and all bulk quasiparticles are far from the point contact , we can take this pair of @xmath18s to fuse to @xmath57 since the backscattering process is a very small motion of a quasiparticle which does not involve any braiding and , therefore , does not create a @xmath58 . an alternative way to understand",
    "this is to note that one can choose a gauge in which the non - abelian gauge field due to bulk quasiparticles vanishes at the point contact . in this way",
    ", we can give a precise meaning to operators such as @xmath42 .",
    "however , when we compute perturbatively in the backscattering , we would like to know how successive @xmath18 fields on the _ same _ edge fuse .",
    "fortunately , the condition that the pair of @xmath18s which is created on opposite edges by a backscattering event can be converted ( using a feature of anyon systems called the @xmath62-matrix ) into a condition on the fusion channels of successive @xmath18 fields on the same edge .",
    "this leads , according to the arguments of refs .",
    ", to a mapping of the single point contact problem to a kondo - esque impurity problem .    when there are two point contacts , the quasiparticle history associated with a backscattering process at one of the point contacts must necessarily wind around the bulk quasiparticles in the interferometer .",
    "equivalently , the non - abelian gauge field due to bulk quasiparticles is non - vanishing at one of the point contacts or along one of the edges between the two point contacts ; the simplest gauge is one in which the gauge field is concentrated at one of the point contacts , say contact @xmath63 .",
    "if there is an even number of quasiparticles in the interferometer , their effect can be encapsulated in an extra phase @xmath64 ( dependent on the overall parity of the topological qubits in the interference loop ) which we have absorbed into @xmath23 . however , as shown in ref .",
    ", if there is an odd number of quasiparticles in the loop , then the pair of @xmath18s which is created by @xmath65 must fuse to @xmath58 instead of @xmath57 .",
    "this makes no difference as far as local properties of that point contact are concerned .",
    "( in fact , in the single point - contact problem , we could have taken each backscattered pair to fuse to @xmath58 instead of to @xmath57 , which would correspond to a non - standard gauge choice .",
    "this would have no effect on any physical property and would lead to the same kond - esque model . )    however , if we consider the interference between the backscattering processes due to @xmath66 and @xmath65 when there is an odd number of quasiparticles in the interference loop , it is significant that the pair of @xmath18s created by the former fuse to @xmath57 but those created by the latter fuse to @xmath58 .",

    "however , when a bulk quasiparticle is coupled to the edge according to ( [ eqn : bulk - edge - coupling ] ) , fermion number parity is no longer conserved .",
    "thus , this correlation function need not vanish , and an interference term can be present even for odd quasiparticle numbers @xcite .",

    "we show how this interference term can be computed exactly in @xmath69 ( but still to lowest order in @xmath73 ) .",
    "when there is an even number of @xmath1 quasiparticles in the bulk of a pfaffian or anti - pfaffian droplet , the majorana fermions have anti - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "when there is an odd number , the majorana fermions have periodic boundary conditions . this can be understood in terms of the classical critical @xmath74 ising model in the following way@xcite .",
    "the droplet is ` squashed ' down so that the bottom and top edges become the right- and left - moving modes of the ising model .",
    "the bulk is forgotten about , except insofar as it affects the boundary conditions at the two ends of the droplet , where right - moving modes are reflected into left - moving ones and vice versa .",
    "since there is no scale in this problem , the boundary conditions must be conformally - invariant ; in the ising model , this means that the ising spins can either have free or fixed boundary conditions .",
    "when there is an even number of quasiparticles in the bulk and their combined topological qubit has a fixed fermion number parity , there are fixed boundary conditions at both ends of the droplet .",
    "when there is an odd number of quasiparticles in the bulk , there is a free boundary condition at one end of the strip and a fixed boundary condition at the other end .",
    "a majorana fermion acquires a minus sign when it goes around a @xmath18 ; thus an odd number of @xmath18 particles can change anti - periodic boundary conditions to periodic .",
    "( for even @xmath1 quasiparticle numbers , every branch cut can begin and end at a bulk quasiparticle , and no branch cuts need cross the edge . )",
    "the branch cut emanating from a @xmath18 can be moved anywhere we like by a @xmath75 gauge transformation .",
    "the most convenient place for our purposes is one of the ends of the squashed droplet ; at this end , the ising spin has free boundary condition . by a @xmath75 gauge transformation",
    ", we could move the branch cut to the other end . interchanging the free and fixed ends in this manner is simply a kramers - wannier duality transformation . for details , see ref . .",
    "to apply this perspective to a two point - contact interferometer , we will assume that @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which we can arrange by a conformal transformation .",
    "then , we fold the interferometer about the point @xmath78 , as depicted in fig . [ fig : interfero ] . as a result ,",
    "the majorana fermion field on the bottom edge , @xmath79 , which was purely a right - moving field on the line @xmath80 now has both right- and left - moving components , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , on the half - line @xmath83 .",
    "the same holds for the top edge . for bulk - edge coupling @xmath84",
    ", there is no scale in this problem , so the boundary conditions at @xmath78 must be conformally - invariant . if there is an odd - number of @xmath1 quasiparticles in the bulk , then there will be a branch cut and , again , we are free to put his branch cut wherever we like . as shown in fig .",
