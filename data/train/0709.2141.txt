    "the problem of finding upper bounds for the thurston  bennequin and self - linking numbers of knots has garnered a fair bit of recent attention .",
    "although this originated as a problem in contact geometry , it now lies more in the realm of knot theory and braid theory , with upper bounds given by the seifert and slice genus , the kauffman and homfly - pt polynomials , and , more recently , khovanov homology , khovanov  rozansky homology , and knot floer homology .",
    "these bounds are sometimes collectively called `` bennequin type inequalities '' .",
    "the original proofs of many bennequin type inequalities were remarkably diverse and sometimes somewhat ad hoc . in this paper , we provide a template which simultaneously proves a number of the significant bennequin type inequalities , thus providing a unified approach to many of these bounds .",
    "the proof of the template itself is a fairly easy induction argument based on the remarkable work of rutherford @xcite .",
    "our template gives a means to prove future , yet to be discovered bennequin type bounds , for example using khovanov and rozansky s proposed categorification of the kauffman polynomial @xcite .",
    "it also sheds some light on why particular bounds may be sharp for a certain legendrian knot while others are not ; see section  [ sec : tree ] .",
    "we briefly recall the relevant definitions ; see also @xcite or any number of other references .",
    "legendrian _ knot or link in @xmath1 with the standard contact structure is a smooth , oriented knot or link along which @xmath2 everywhere .",
    "it is convenient to represent legendrians by their _",
    "front projections _ to the @xmath3 plane , which are ( a collection of ) oriented closed curves with no vertical tangencies , whose only singularities are transverse double points and semicubical cusps .",
    "given a front , one obtains a link diagram by smoothing out cusps and resolving each double point to a crossing where the strand with larger slope lies below the strand with smaller slope ; this link diagram , which we will call the _ smoothed front _ , is the topological type of the original legendrian link .",
    "any topological link has a legendrian representative .",
    "given a front @xmath4 , let @xmath5 denote half of the number of cusps of @xmath4 , and let @xmath6 denote the number of cusps of @xmath4 which are oriented downwards .",
    "also let @xmath7 denote the writhe of the corresponding smoothed front , the number of crossings counted with the standard signs ( @xmath8 for , @xmath9 for ) .",
    "define the _ thurston  bennequin number _ and _ self - linking number _ of @xmath4 , respectively , by @xmath10 the thurston ",
    "bennequin and self - linking numbers are invariants of legendrian links and comprise the `` classical invariants '' for legendrians in @xmath1 .",
    "( in the literature , the role of the self - linking number for legendrian links is usually played by the rotation number @xmath11 , and the self - linking number is reserved for transverse links ; our self - linking number for a legendrian is the usual self - linking number of its positive transverse pushoff . )    within a topological type , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for legendrian representatives is always unbounded below ; one can decrease @xmath12 and @xmath13 by adding zigzags to a front .",
    "however , in the early 1980 s , bennequin @xcite proved the remarkable fact that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are bounded above for any link type @xmath14 , by negative the minimal euler characteristic for a seifert surface bounding @xmath14 ; for knots @xmath15 , @xmath16 for any front @xmath4 representing @xmath15 , where @xmath17 is the seifert genus .",
    "bennequin s inequality has subsequently been improved to a menagerie of different bounds on @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for a topological link @xmath14 ,",
    "define the _ maximal thurston ",

    "@xmath21 always : rotating any front @xmath4 @xmath22 produces another front @xmath23 of the same topological type with @xmath24 .",
    "it follows that any upper bound for @xmath25 is also an upper bound for @xmath26 .",
    "however , the kauffman and khovanov @xmath26 bounds above do not extend to bounds on @xmath25 . *",
    "some bennequin type inequalities imply others .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28 bounds ( and presumably the homfly - pt homology bound ) imply slice - bennequin , which in turn implies bennequin ; the homfly - pt homology bound also implies the homfly - pt ( polynomial ) bound . on the other hand ,",
    "many pairs of the inequalities are incommensurable , notably the kauffman and khovanov bounds @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . *",
    "the above inequalities ( in particular , the kauffman , khovanov , and homfly - pt bounds ) suffice to calculate @xmath26 and @xmath25 for all but a handful of knots with @xmath29 or fewer crossings @xcite . * the kauffman and homfly - pt bounds",
