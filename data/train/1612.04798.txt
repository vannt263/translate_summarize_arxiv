    "one approach to determine the ratio @xmath0 of cabibbo-kobayashi-maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , as suggested in @xcite , is by using the ratio of the experimentally determined pion and kaon leptonic decay rates @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the particle masses , and @xmath5 is an electromagnetic correction factor ) .",
    "this in turn requires the determination of the ratio of kaon to pion decays constants , @xmath6 , a non - perturbative task , where the lattice approach to qcd may be of help .",
    "for some recent work see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the qcd interaction is flavour - blind and so when neglecting electromagnetic and weak interactions , the only difference between the quark flavours comes from the mass matrix . in this article",
    "we want to examine how this constrains meson decay matrix elements once full @xmath7 flavour symmetry is broken , using the same methods as we used in @xcite for hadron masses .",
    "in particular we shall consider pseudoscalar decay matrix elements and give an estimation for @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( ignoring electromagnetic contributions ) .",
    "in lattice simulations with three dynamical quarks there are many paths to approach the physical point where the quark masses take their physical values .",
    "the choice adopted here is to extrapolate from a point on the @xmath7 flavour symmetry line keeping the singlet quark mass @xmath10 constant , as illustrated in the left panel of fig .",

    "this allows the development of an @xmath7 flavour symmetry breaking expansion for hadron masses and matrix elements , i.e.an expansion in @xmath15 ( where numerically @xmath16 ) . from this definition",
    "we have the trivial constraint @xmath17 the path to the physical quark masses is called the ` unitary line ' as we expand in the same masses for the sea and valence quarks . note",
    "also that the expansion coefficients are functions of @xmath10 only , which provided we keep @xmath18 reduces the number of allowed expansion coefficients considerably .    as an example of an @xmath7 flavour symmetry breaking expansion , @xcite",
    ", we consider the pseudoscalar masses , and find to next - to - leading - order , nlo , ( i.e.  @xmath19 ) .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are quark masses with @xmath23 .",
    "this describes the physical outer ring of the pseudoscalar meson octet ( the right panel of fig .",
    "[ path+octet ] ) .",
    "numerically we can also in addition consider a fictitious particle , where @xmath24 , which we call @xmath25 .",
    "we have further extended the expansion to the next - to - next - to - leading or nnlo case , @xcite .",
    "as the expressions start to become unwieldy , they have been relegated to appendix  [ nnlo_expan ] .",
    "( octet baryons also have equivalent expansions , @xcite . )",
    "the vacuum is a flavour singlet , so meson to vacuum matrix elements @xmath26 are proportional to @xmath27 tensors , i.e.   @xmath28 matrices , where @xmath29 is an octet operator .",
    "so the allowed mass dependence of the outer ring octet decay constants is similar to the allowed dependence of the octet masses .",
    "thus we have @xmath30 the @xmath7 flavour symmetric breaking expansion has the simple property that for any flavour singlet quantity , which we generically denote by @xmath31 then @xmath32 this is already encoded in the above pseudoscalar @xmath7 flavour symmetric breaking expansions , or more generally it can be shown , @xcite , that @xmath33 has a stationary point about the @xmath7 flavour symmetric line",

    ", it can be shown that this property also holds using chiral perturbation theory .",
    "for example for mass degenerate @xmath45 and @xmath46 quark masses and assuming @xmath47pt is valid in the region of the @xmath7 flavour symmetric quark mass we find @xmath48 + o((\\delta\\chi_l)^2 ) \\",

    "( [ xfcpt ] ) , as expected , there is an absence of a linear term @xmath56 .",
    "the unitary range is rather small so we introduce pq or partially quenching ( i.e.  the valence quark masses can be different to the sea quark masses ) .",
    "this does not increase the number of expansion coefficients .",

    "this will later prove useful for the numerical results .",
