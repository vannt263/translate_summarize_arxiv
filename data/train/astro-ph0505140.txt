    "an electron circling a constant magnetic field at @xmath3 the speed of light emits about @xmath4 times less energy in a given time than is predicted by the synchrotron theory .",
    "it is similarly less likely to re - absorb radiation , and will emit light with a polarization fraction three - halves the amount predicted by that theory . yet , while the foundation for a complete theory of transrelativistic magnetobremsstrahlung ( or cyclo - synchrotron radiation ) was put forward some time ago ( oster 1963 ) , the solution of this equation has been given only recently , and then only partially ( see , e.g. , petrosian 1981 ; takahara and tsuruta 1982 ; melia 1994 ; mahadevan et al . 1996 ) . here , we provide analytic fits to the ( complete ) numerical solution , and demonstrate the power of this technique for thermal and pure power - law ( mildly relativistic ) particle distributions .",
    "the application to arbitrary particle populations is equally straightforward .",
    "quasi - relativistic and relativistic particles are quite common in high - energy astrophysical environments .",
    "plasmas that contain energetic electrons also tend to be magnetized . often , the dominant emission mechanism in these sources is thermal or nonthermal cyclo - synchrotron radiation .",
    "for example , this type of situation is increasingly seen in hot accretion flows onto compact objects , such as weakly accreting supermassive black holes ( see also melia 1994 ; melia and falcke 2001 ) .",
    "the frequency and emissivity of the radiation undergo dramatic changes as the particle energy transitions from nonrelativistic to extreme relativistic values .",
    "the ever greater smearing of successive harmonics causes a pronounced overlapping that forms an almost monotonically decreasing spectrum at high temperature , whereas the lower - energy spectrum consists of discrete lines of rapidly decreasing intensity separated by the cyclotron ( or magnetic ) frequency @xmath5 , in terms of the magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "a problem of this significance has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "its provenance dates to schwinger ( 1949 ) , who calculated the emission in the extreme nonrelativistic limit . in this case , the frequency of emitted light is precisely the inverse of the amount of time it takes an electron to make one orbit , and integer multiples of this fundamental magnetic frequency , @xmath7 . in oster s ( 1961 )",
    "formulation , the field equations of a particle circling a constant magnetic field are derived from the lienard - wiechert potentials and fourier - analyzed at the retarded time ( see , e.g. , melia 2001 ) .",
    "the cyclotron harmonics are therefore broadened , not due to doppler shifts but to the relativistic dependence of the resonance frequency on the particle energy , until they reach a synchrotron continuum .",
    "the language of this field reflects its long history . `",
    "cyclotron ' is nonrelativistic emission ( @xmath8 k ) which is symmetric , given by keeping only the first term in the series expansion of the bessel function in equation ( 2 ) ( below ) .",
    "` gyroresonance ' or ` gyrosynchrotron ' is the slightly relativistic ( @xmath9 k ) emission characterized as an asymmetric dipole , and given by taking a carlini expansion of the bessel function . `",
    "synchrotron ' is fully relativistic ( @xmath10 k ) , continuous , and radially asymmetric ; it is calculated from the general formula by approximating the bessel functions using airy functions .",
    "the entire range of emission is sometimes called ` magnetobremsstrahlung ' , implying the scattering of virtual photons in the magnetic field by the gyrating charges .    an analytic approach to oster s complete description was made by petrosian ( 1981 ) in the mildly relativistic regime @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "this motivated a series of calculations of the emissivity , cross - section , and polarization , summarized in dulk ( 1985 ) , who simplified the expressions and applied them to solar radio emission .",
    "ghisellini & svensson ( 1991 ) provided angle - averaged expressions of the petrosian approximation for emission and absorption .",
    "melia ( 1994 ) then presented a numerical solution from oster s formulation , which was limited to an observer angle of @xmath13 .",
    "the first complete numerical solution was put forward by mahadevan , narayan , and yi ( 1996 , mny96 ) , and this was followed by a detailed fitting of the numerical solution by marcowith and malzac ( 2003 , mm03 ) .",
    "each of these approaches leaves significant room for improvement ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "1 ) . the limitation of observer angle in melia ( 1994 ) neglects a significant portion of the emissivity .",
    "mm03 consider only the first @xmath14 harmonics , a procedure that fails entirely in the region above @xmath15a surprisingly high number of harmonics are required to correctly transition to the relativistic regime ( see fig .",
    "the approximations of petrosian ( 1981 ) and ghisellini & svensson ( 1991 ) do not capture the harmonic quality of transrelativistic emission ; the former fares less well in the low - frequency limit , the latter in the low - velocity limit .",
    "the correction needed around @xmath16 is @xmath17 , while around @xmath18 it is @xmath19 .",
    "the carlini expansion is an excellent approximation , but it nevertheless fails below @xmath20 ( petrosian and mctiernan 1984 ) .",
    "the calculation of mny96 is complete , but their fits only apply to four specific thermal luminosities .",
    "their result is irretrievably numerical , and can not be reproduced or generalized without duplicating the full ( time intensive ) integration .    despite these shortcomings ,",
    "there is no need to attempt an additional solution if it is not simpler to use , as well as more accurate .",
    "the polynomial fits we present here require a small table of coefficients , yet capture both the scale and harmonic nature of radiation in the transrelativistic regime . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the calculational procedure , and then apply it to a determination of the emissivity and polarization fraction of the radiation in    3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "it is also straightforward to calculate the synchrotron absorptive cross section , which we do in   5 , and we present our conclusions in   6 .",
    "the complete emissivity ( energy per unit volume , per unit time , per unit frequency ) of a particle distribution @xmath21 with ( dimensionless ) velocity components @xmath22 and @xmath23 relative to the underlying magnetic field , is given by @xmath24 in terms of the single particle emissivity @xmath25\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression , @xmath26 is the ratio of the observed frequency to the first harmonic , @xmath27 is the angle between the velocity and the line - of - sight , and @xmath28 is the angle between the particle s velocity and the magnetic field .",
    "the function @xmath29\\ ] ] is a computational approximation to the delta function at the harmonic resonances ( see mny96 ) .",
    "note here that the sum extends to the 990th harmonic , imposed by computational precision , and that a typo of the bessel function s argument from mny96 has been corrected .",
    "the term proportional to the square of the bessel function @xmath30 is emitted with ordinary ( o ) polarization , while the term proportional to the square of its derivative is associated with extraordinary ( x ) polarization .",
    "the comparison between previous approximations to the solution of @xmath31 can best be made with reference to figure  1 , which shows @xmath31 as a function of @xmath32 for @xmath33 . here and throughout we plot the dimensionless emissivity @xmath34 .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , and shown more graphically here , none of the previous approaches can simultaneously handle both the harmonic structure at low energy and the behavior at high energy .",
    "we also see immediately ( fig .",
    "2 ) that a very large number ( here 990 ) of harmonics must be used to adequately represent @xmath31 for @xmath35 .    to map the transition of the emissivity from nonrelativistic to highly relativistic particle dynamics , we show in figure  3 other values of the integral @xmath31 for a series of velocities @xmath36 , together with the numerical evaluation of equation ( 2 ) and our fitting function , described below . on this scale ,",
    "the complete solutions and their fits are indistinguishable .",
    "however , neither the cyclotron nor the synchrotron limits are adequate representations for these mildly relativistic values of @xmath36 .    to make these fits",
    ", we restrict our attention to @xmath37 , where most of the transrelativistic emission takes place .",
    "our ansatz takes the form @xmath38",
    "j_1 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_m}{l }   \\,\\log_{10 } \\chi\\right)\\ ] ] ( see appendix a for a definition of the fejer - averaged sum ) .",
    "the terms within brackets are the constants of the initial emissivity expansion , which have themselves been re - expanded as functions of @xmath39 .",
    "the constants @xmath40 then form a @xmath41 table of numbers that completely specify the emissivity .",
    "the fit is valid between @xmath42 , beyond which the cyclotron and synchrotron formulae apply .",
    "it has a mean error of between @xmath43@xmath44 in order ( shown in figure  4 ) , the largest error lying between harmonics near the cyclotron limit . by comparison",
    ", the approximation of petrosian ( 1981 ) fails in these locations by several orders .",
    "the table @xmath40 , together with a function that returns the emissivity for any given @xmath36 , is available in the electronic edition of this paper .",
    "the evaluation of equation ( 1 ) for the particle averaged emissivity is straightforward for any distribution @xmath21 . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we here consider the special case of an arbitrarily relativistic thermal ( equilibrium ) distribution , @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and that of a pure power law , @xmath47 arising , e.g. , in shock acceleration , or stochastic particle acceleration ( a second - order fermi process ) in a turbulent magnetic field .",
    "the thermally averaged synchrotron emissivity from our expansion is shown in figure  5 , compared to the full numerical result .",
    "when @xmath36 extends past @xmath48 we use petrosian s approximation . both the low- and high - frequency behaviors are well matched , as is the harmonic structure .",
    "the mean error incurred with the use of our expansion is never bigger than @xmath2 over the entire temperature range @xmath49 k @xmath50 k. caution must be used with the angle - averaged synchrotron fit of mny96 , which is not a good approximation in this regime ( figure  6 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the transition from relativistic to nonrelativistic synchrotron emissivity occurs at a different temperature than that of the corresponding transition in the particle distribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cyclotron limit applies when @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the harmonic number ( schwinger 1949 ) , and not @xmath53 , as is usually thought . to make this point clearer ,",
    "let us compare the thermally averaged energy per particle @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 in the nonrelativistic limit , and @xmath56 for fully relativistic particles ) to the thermally averaged magnetobremsstrahlung power .",
    "the factor @xmath57 therefore defines the non - relativistic and ultra - relativisitc domains .",
    "it is @xmath58 above @xmath59 k , and @xmath60 below @xmath61 k. the magnetobremsstahlung power , however , is dominated by the first cyclotron harmonic until @xmath62 k , and is within a few percent of synchrotron by @xmath63 k. ( equation 1 varies from the first cyclotron harmonic by a factor @xmath64 , due to angle - averaging . )    that is , relativity s effect on cyclotron emission is important at approximately one - tenth the temperature at which it becomes important for the distribution itself .",
    "our intuition of what constitutes a relativistic temperature must be modified in this case .",
    "we also average over the power - law distribution .",
    "we plot the power - law averaged synchrotron emissivity in figure  7 . in all of these cases",
    ", the high - energy spectrum matches the synchrotron power relation , since power - laws always extend to high @xmath39 .",
    "however , power - laws are also dominated by @xmath65 , thus there is a spectral bump near @xmath66 for all @xmath67 , and emission below the peak remains dominated by the broadened first harmonic , rather than an overlap of many harmonics as in the synchrotron regime .",
    "therefore , this region underproduces emission with respect to the synchrotron approximation ; neither the synchrotron nor the petrosian approximations apply below @xmath68 for any spectral index above @xmath69 . in this region",
    ", we may relate the spectral index @xmath70 and the particle distribution index @xmath71 as @xmath72 which is at odds with the synchrotron relation .",
    "the expanded emissivity may be averaged over any particle distribution  power law , bi - thermal , or hybrid , as required  with equal facility .",
    "non - relativistic cyclo - synchrotron polarization is straightforward : along the axis of rotation , light is circularly polarized in the direction of rotation , while in the plane of rotation it is linearly polarized . as light",
    "is beamed into a boosted direction , however , these orientations become mixed ; thus the two limiting forms have quite different results .",
    "the polarization fraction at @xmath73 was first solved by trubnikov ( 1962 ) .",
    "petrosian s approximation was followed by robinson and melrose ( 1984 ) and dulk ( 1985 ) for non - isotropic pitch angle distributions .",
    "petrosian and mctiernan ( 1983 ) calculated the polarization fraction at the ` critical energy ' where synchrotron emission is peaked . in",
    "what follows , we refer to @xmath74 as the ` polarization fraction ' , and to @xmath75 as the ` polarization content ' ; the distinction is required to compare with past results .",
    "we have expanded the angle - integrated equation ( 2 ) in both the ordinary and extraordinary polarization directions in the same manner as above , yielding two additional @xmath76 data tables .",
    "figure  8 shows these numerical emissivities together with their expansion , and figure  9 shows the frequency - integrated single - particle polarization fraction @xmath74 from the nonrelativistic to the relativistic regime . in the low - energy limit , this fraction is dominated by low frequencies and moves correctly to the limit of @xmath77 given by trubnikov , while in the high - energy limit it matches the synchrotron value . in between , the polarization fraction may be @xmath78 bigger than the synchrotron value .",
    "figure  10 shows the polarization content , @xmath79 , for a thermal distribution as a function of temperature and frequency .",
    "the approximate expression for the thermal polarization fraction given by petrosian and mctiernan ( 1983 ) , valid at the critical energy and for @xmath80 is @xmath81 and is plotted at @xmath82 degrees ( dashed ) .",
    "petrosian s result is therefore accurate near this angle , although it is not obvious _ a priori _ what angle dominates emission in the transrelativistic regime ( transrelativistic emission is not a simple dipole , see mny96 ) .",
    "both of these results are irreconcilable with those given by dulk , however , perhaps because his approximation includes an anisotropic pitch - angle distribution .    our own approximation to the thermal polarization content , assuming isotropic pitch - angles , is @xmath83 ( -1.6\\,\\psi+0.47),\\ ] ] which is valid between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it is accurate to @xmath86 in the nonrelativistic case , where one should anyway use the cyclotron polarization , and @xmath87 once @xmath88 . a brief discussion of how this figure relates to the circular and linear polarization content is given in appendix b.",
    "our analytic fits make the calculation of the synchrotron cross section particularly simple .",
    "we require @xmath89,\\ ] ] where the term in brackets may be differentiated using the emissivity tables .",
    "this cross - section is presented , along with the limiting forms of ghisellini & svensson s ( 1991 ) equation ( 23 ) , and the synchrotron limit , in figure  11 . at @xmath90 in the low - frequency regime",
    "petrosian s limit would incur an error of @xmath64 and the synchrotron limit an error of @xmath91 .",
    "by @xmath92 these figures are @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and the synchrotron limit may be favorably used above this . in the high - frequency regime ,",
    "petrosian s limit is always preferred .",
    "in this paper , we have presented fitting formulae , appropriate for both analytic and high - speed numerical calculations , for magnetobremsstrahlung in the transrelativistic regime .",
    "we have found that the magnetobremsstrahlung transrelativistic regime actually lies between @xmath95 k and @xmath96 k  lower in temperature than is usually thought on the basis of where the transition occurs for the particle distribution itself .",
    "we have also concluded that for the latter half of this range , a harmonic number larger than @xmath97 is required for reasonable accuracy .",
    "we have demonstrated the presence of a spectral bump for power - law distributions when @xmath98 , and have found a relation between spectral and distribution indices in a regime where neither the petrosian nor the synchrotron approximations apply . and ,",
    "finally , we have shown that the polarization fraction of transrelativistic cyclo - synchrotron radiation is approximately @xmath78 that of its relativistic value .",
    "thus , there is sufficient reason for those interested in standard thermal or power - law distributions in the transrelativistic regime to use the correct theory .",
    "high - energy plasmas are less likely to fall into these categories .    together with our previous work on a covariant kinetic theory ( wolfe and melia 2005 )",
    ", these calculations form a coherent picture of high - energy magnetized plasmas . in upcoming papers",
    ", we will apply these theories to several systems of current and active interest , including a careful and accurate prediction of the @xmath39-ray and neutrino production in the hierarchical merging of galaxy clusters , related to the non - thermal hard x - ray excess now detected from these sources , and to weakly accreting supermassive black holes , such as sgr a * at the galactic center , where plasma temperatures as high as @xmath99 k are reached within @xmath100 schwarzschild radii of the event horizon .",
    "we anticipate that use of the polynomial expansions we have presented here will extend to many other sub - branches of astrophysics and to other physics disciplines where transrelativistic particle distributions are active .",
    "the fourier - bessel series expands the function @xmath101here the single - particle emissivity  as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the @xmath79th positive root of @xmath104 . here",
    "@xmath105 is the order of the bessel function , the coefficient @xmath79 is the expansion harmonic number and @xmath52 is the largest expansion coefficient . the functions @xmath106 and @xmath101 are different for any @xmath107 .",
    "the fejer averaging is a technique of signal processing which makes some non - convergent expansions converge , and helps many expansions converge faster .",
    "yet it is easy to apply .",
    "this technique averages the contributions for increasing numbers of harmonics , @xmath108 where the function @xmath109 is now considered a more accurate version of @xmath101 than @xmath106 .",
    "however , we have found that extending the sum only to the higher half of the total expansion number results in lower standard deviations .",
    "we denote fejer sums as @xmath110 .",
    "the emissivity in equation ( 2 ) is expressed in ordinary and extraordinary modes . to place these in the observationally relevant linear and circular polarizations , we use a poincare sphere with latitude t",
    "( the ratio of the ellipse s major and semimajor axes ) and longitude k ( the ellipse s tilt angle ) . as we are interested only in the ratios of circular and linear polarizations",
    ", we neglect the tilt angle k ; this is equivalent to setting the stokes parameter @xmath111 to zero",
    ". then the linear and circular polarization contents are @xmath112 where the ordinary and extraordinary axial ratios are @xmath113 and @xmath114 thus the modes are circularly polarized ( @xmath115 ) for @xmath116 and linearly polarized ( @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
