    "much of our knowledge of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) comes from the rest - frame uv line absorption that it imprints on the spectra of background quasars : the forest of neutral hydrogen and associated metal lines such as and .",
    "the forest is produced mainly by diffuse , photoionized gas at temperatures @xmath12 , and it appears to trace the main reservoir of cosmic baryons at high redshift @xcite .",
    "the forest thins out at low redshift , and cosmological simulations predict that the continuing process of structure formation heats a substantial fraction of intergalactic gas to temperatures where it produces little hydrogen absorption , and where the dominant ionization stages of heavier elements have absorption transitions at x - ray wavelengths rather than uv .",
    "hot , dense gas in the central regions of galaxy clusters and groups can be detected by its x - ray emission , but most of the shock - heated gas resides in the outskirts of virialized halos and in lower density , filamentary structures , making its continuum emission weak .",
    "one of the few prospects for detecting this low density , shock - heated gas is via the `` x - ray forest '' of absorption lines it should produce in quasar spectra @xcite .",
    "@xcite find strong evidence for absorption by highly ionized oxygen and neon at @xmath13 , but there have been no clear detections to date of intergalactic x - ray absorption originating beyond the local group .",
    "this paper describes a search for x - ray forest absorption towards h1821 + 643 ( @xmath1 ) using a high resolution ( @xmath14 ) spectrum obtained in a 470 ksec observation with the x - ray observatory .    the baryon density implied by big bang nucleosynthesis and the estimated primordial deuterium abundance , @xmath15 ( @xcite ; here @xmath16 ) , exceeds the density of baryons in known stars and x - ray emitting gas by roughly an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the lower density regime of the `` warm - hot intergalactic medium '' ( whim , a term coined by @xcite [ @xcite ] to refer to gas in the temperature range @xmath17 ) could constitute a major fraction of the `` missing '' low redshift baryons .",
    "hydrodynamic cosmological simulations predict that 30 - 50% of the baryons reside in this phase at @xmath18 ( @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hst and fuse detections of ( @xmath19 ) absorption lines towards h1821 + 643 and pg0953 + 415 ( @xcite , hereafter tsj ; @xcite ) offer a tantalizing hint of this baryon reservoir .",
    "adopting conservative assumptions of [ o / h]@xmath20 and an ionization fraction @xmath21()=0.2 ( which is close to the maximum in photo- or collisional ionization ) , tsj conclude that the gas associated with these weak absorbers accounts for @xmath22 of the cosmic baryon budget , comparable in total mass to all other known low redshift components combined .",
    "they remark , moreover , that @xmath5 could plausibly be much lower than 0.2 , implying a substantially higher baryon fraction . for most reasonable assumptions about the physical conditions of this absorbing gas ,",
    "the dominant ionization state should be or .",
    "gas hotter than @xmath23 would have very low @xmath5 , so it might produce or absorption with no detectable .",
    "we chose h1821 + 643 for our x - ray forest search in part because it is one of the brightest x - ray quasar at moderate redshift , and in part because it has been studied carefully for intervening absorption ( tsj ; @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical expectations for x - ray forest absorption depend strongly on the assumed metallicity distribution of the moderate density , shock - heated igm , a subject on which there is little empirical guidance .",
    "however , for metallicities @xmath24 , simulations and analytic calculations predict few or lines above column density @xmath25 @xcite , and weaker absorption by other elements , so even long exposures with or _ xmm - newton _ are unlikely to detect absorption at high signal - to - noise ratio . searching at redshifts with known absorption allows one to adopt a lower effective threshold for significant detection , greatly increasing the odds of success .",
    "furthermore , detections of or upper limits on x - ray absorption provide new constraints on the physical conditions of the absorbers .",
    "we chose the duration of our spectroscopic observation so that if @xmath9/f(\\ovin ) \\sim 30 $ ] , a physically plausible ratio that would imply that absorbers contain a large fraction of the `` missing '' low redshift baryons , then we would clearly detect the strongest of the tsj systems , and we would detect the next two strongest systems at the @xmath26 level .",
    "as we will show below , we find only a @xmath27 signal from the strongest tsj system , but we obtain @xmath28 detections of from the next strongest system and of and from the system discovered by @xcite .",
    "we also find features that could correspond to oxygen absorption at other redshifts close to the detected systems ( within 1000@xmath29 ) , and a possible signature of absorption from one system .",
    "the best estimate of the mean @xmath9/f(\\ovin)$ ] from our data is @xmath30 , but the moderate statistical significance of our detections and the implied variation in @xmath5 from system to system leave the interpretation of our results more ambiguous than we would like .",
    "nonetheless , this observation provides the strongest evidence to date for the moderate density , shock - heated igm predicted by theoretical models , and the detections and upper limits have important implications for the physical state of the absorption systems and for their connection to the missing baryons of the low redshift universe .",
    "we proceed to a description of the observations , data reduction , and absorption line analysis , then to a discussion of these implications .",
    "we observed h1821 + 643 with between 2001 january 17 and january 24 , for a total exposure time of 470 ksec .",
    "the observation was divided into four different parts : obsids 2186 , 2418 , 2310 and 2311 .",
    "we used the low energy transmission grating ( letg , @xcite ) with the advanced ccd imaging camera for spectroscopy ( acis - s , c. r. canizares in preparation ) .",
    "our primary interest is in and lines with rest wavelengths of 21.602  and 18.969 , respectively , and thus in the observed wavelength range 18.928  that runs from at @xmath18 to at the quasar redshift @xmath1 . since the lines are expected to be low s / n , it is important to optimize the instrument response in this interval . to avoid the s3/s4 chip gap between 21.2 and 21.8  ,",
    "the aim point was offset by 2@xmath31 in + y direction . this offset moves the chip gap to 27.928.5 , so the entire first order spectrum in the wavelengths of interest is now on s3 .",
    "since the telescope focus is on s3 , this choice enhances the effective area around 25  . to ameliorate the effects of cti for spectral order sorting , a sim - z offset of -8 mm",
    "was chosen .",
    "accordingly , an acis - s subarray with rows 49256 was used .",
    "the shift of aimpoint , essential for optimizing wavelength coverage and effective area in the most interesting part of the spectrum , had the additional effect of placing the zeroth - order grating image close to the s2/s3 chip gap .",
    "this is not a concern from the scientific point of view , since the x - ray forest search relies on the high resolution , dispersed spectrum .",
    "however , the standard processing software ( interactive analysis of observations , ciao , elvis et al .  in preparation ) failed to process the data properly as a result of this non - standard aim - point . in particular , the ciao tool * tg_resolve_events * , which assigns a wavelength and an order to each observed photon , failed .",
    "this problem was fixed in ciao version 2.2 , and the data were reprocessed to recover all of the observed photons .",
    "we used ciao version 2.2 in all the data reduction and analysis .",
    "we extracted spectra from each of the four observations separately , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 orders were co - added .",
    "the four resulting spectra were then co - added to construct the full first - order spectrum .",
    "errors in observed counts were appropriately propagated .",
    "the net observed count rate is 0.428 counts per second for the combined first - order spectrum , with @xmath34 total net counts .",
    "the unbinned spectrum has 8192 wavelength channels with @xmath35  .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the line response function is about 0.05 , increasing to larger values longward of about 50 .",
    "the spectral resolution is therefore @xmath36 at 25 .",
    "the data span the wavelength range from 1 to 60  , but there is essentially no detectable flux longward of @xmath37 .",
    "the understanding of the absolute wavelength calibration of spectra is continually evolving , but the best current evidence is that the measured wavelengths near 25  are offset with respect to true wavelengths by an amount @xmath38 . while we could add a 0.0125  offset to all measured wavelengths and thereby make the calibration uncertainty symmetric about zero , we have chosen instead to keep the standard wavelength scale and to consider an observed feature `` matched '' to a predicted feature at wavelength @xmath39 if it lies between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "in order to detect and measure absorption lines , we first need an accurate model of the unabsorbed continuum . the continuum properties of h1821 + 643 have been discussed by @xcite , so we will not examine them in detail here .",
    "we obtain a continuum for purposes of line detection by fitting a smooth model to the coarsely binned first - order spectrum . the model that we fit",
    "is @xmath41 , \\label{eqn : cont}\\ ] ] representing power - law emission absorbed by galactic gas with hydrogen column density @xmath42 and bound - free absorption cross - section @xmath43 .",
    "however , we found that a single power law did not provide an adequate fit over the entire range of the data , and we therefore carried out two independent fits in the range 0.30.7 kev ( 17.741.3 ) and 0.61 kev ( 12.420.7 ) .",
    "we use the first fit to search for lines in the and region , and the second to search for lines in the and region . obtaining an adequate representation of the data",
    "further requires that we treat the column density @xmath42 as a free parameter rather than adopting the standard value of @xmath44 @xcite ; in effect , we use @xmath42 as a parameter to describe departures from a power law , whether intrinsic to the quasar or caused by the galactic ism .",
    "the fit parameters are : in the 0.30.7 kev region , @xmath45 photons kev@xmath46 @xmath47 s@xmath46 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath47 ; in the 0.61 kev region , @xmath50 photons kev@xmath46 @xmath47 s@xmath46 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xmath47 .",
    "both of these fits have @xmath53 , but visual inspection reveals some excess flux between 24 and 25  ( see figure  2 , top ) , which we have chosen to model as two gaussian `` emission lines '' centered at 24.1516  and 24.5629 , with fwhm of 0.3035  and 0.120844 , respectively .",
    "the amplitudes of these features ( i.e. , the integrals under the gaussians ) are @xmath54 and @xmath55 photons @xmath47 s@xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the nature of these `` emission lines '' is unclear .",
    "we analyzed several data sets from the archive that had similar letg / acis - s instrument set - ups to look for possible systematic calibration problems , but these do not show signs of excess flux at these wavelengths .",
    "we expect , therefore , that this flux originates either from the quasar itself or from the surrounding cluster .",
    "a physical characterization is not essential to our purposes here , since we only need to define a smooth continuum that fits our data .",
    "our final continuum model , therefore , consists of one of the two absorbed power laws described above ( depending on the wavelength region ) , with the additional gaussian emission lines in the 2425  region , all modulated by the instrument response , which we fold in by creating an `` arf '' file generated for our observational set - up .",
    "we began our search for potential x - ray forest systems by examining the residuals between the data and this smooth continuum model , looking for correlations between minima of the residual spectrum and the absorption wavelengths expected on the basis of the known systems .",
    "figure  1 shows the residual spectrum in the 2128region , where the associated and lines fall .",
    "the spectrum in the upper panel has been convolved with a beta function of fwhm=0.05 , which represents the line response function ( lrf ) of the instrument at these wavelengths .",
    "this smoothing suppresses uncorrelated noise fluctuations relative to features that have the expected shape of true , unresolved absorption ( or emission ) lines , and it should therefore enhance the contrast of physical absorption features relative to photon noise",
    ". however , lrf convolution systematically broadens features and reduces their central depth ( while preserving their equivalent width ) , so in the lower panel we show the residual spectrum smoothed instead with a savitsky - golay ( s - g ) filter ( see @xcite , section 14.8 ) .",
    "this type of filter approximately preserves the sharpness and depth of features , but it is less effective at suppressing noise .",
    "the two approaches have complementary advantages , and in practice the two residual spectra show significant features at nearly the same locations .",
    "the strong line at @xmath56  is galactic , and at somewhat shorter wavelengths , the galactic o - k edge and features of the instrument response cause rapid variation of the model continuum ( see figure  2 , top panel ) . the blue box running from 22.223.6  marks the wavelength region where these complications make reliable determination of residuals difficult .",
    "we have normalized the residuals of the two smoothed spectra so that , in each case , the range @xmath33 to @xmath32 contains 68% of the data points between 21  and 27.7 , excluding this problematic region .",
    "dotted horizontal lines mark the symmetric range about zero that contains 90% ( upper panel ) or 95% ( lower panel ) of the data points in the same wavelength regions .",
    "solid vertical line segments mark the expected positions of the @xmath5721.602  line of ( green ) and the @xmath5718.969  line of ( red ) at the redshifts of the systems found by tsj and @xcite : @xmath58 , 0.24531 , 0.22637 , 0.22497 , 0.21326 , and 0.12137 . for brevity",
    ", we will often refer to these redshifts simply as z1z6 , in descending order ( right to left in figure  1 ) .",
    "squares below the line segments in the upper panel have an area proportional to the equivalent width of the @xmath571032  line reported by tsj or @xcite .",
    "the wavelength calibration uncertainty @xmath59   corresponds to two channels in these histogram plots .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : observations ] , this uncertainty is not symmetric , and we expect a line associated with a given system to appear in the predicted channel or in one of the two channels to its right ( at higher @xmath57 ) . in velocity units ,",
    "one channel is 0.0125@xmath60 ( at @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , and the wavelength calibration uncertainty is @xmath63 .",
    "visual inspection of either panel of figure  1 shows that three of the deepest minima occur within the 2-channel wavelength calibration uncertainty of the z2 and z6 wavelengths and the z6 wavelength ( 26.901 , 24.224 , and 21.271 , respectively ) .",
    "subsequent analysis ( described below ) shows the presence of absorption features that are significant at the @xmath2 level at these wavelengths , so we classify these systems as probable detections and mark them with filled symbols in the upper panel of figure  1 .",
    "the strongest system lies at z4=0.22497 , and it has a weaker neighbor at z3=0.22637 .",
    "there is a strong minimum in the residual spectrum just redward of the predicted wavelengths , but it is not consistent with lying at either of the redshifts . since this line is comparable in significance to the lines at z2 and z6 , and since it lies within @xmath64 of the strongest system ( and within @xmath65 of the weaker system at z3 ) , we consider it a candidate for an system at a nearby , but previously unknown , absorption redshift , and we mark it by dotted green vertical line segments in figure  1 . in similar fashion , we consider the feature @xmath66 redward of the apparent line at z6 to be a candidate for a new absorption line , marked by the dotted vertical red segments .",
    "there are no strong signals near the redshifts of the other systems .",
    "the wavelength of the z2 system , @xmath67 , lies close to the galactic absorption line , but we still would have been able to detect a separate line if it were present and strong .",
    "there is a strong feature at @xmath68  for which we have no clear identification .",
    "its strength and breadth make it unlikely to be intervening .    for quantitative assessment of features and measurement of line parameters , it is preferable to work with the unsmoothed , directly observed spectrum",
    ". figure  2 shows the 21 - 28  region of the observed spectrum , with no extra smoothing or binning .",
    "starting with , we added to our continuum model a gaussian absorption line at the @xmath5721.602  wavelength for each of the redshifts z1 to z6 .",
    "the intrinsic fwhm of each line was fixed to be @xmath69 , similar to that of the lines ( tsj ) ; the precise value of the line width is unimportant , since the lines are unresolved if they are narrower than @xmath63 .",
    "the normalizations of the absorption lines were thus the only new free parameters , which we determined by fitting the continuum plus absorption lines model to the observed spectrum ( using the continuum parameters determined previously from the coarsely binned data ) , folding in the effective area and the line response function .",
    "we performed this and all subsequent fits using the `` sherpa '' software within ciao-2.2 .",
    "this fit yielded non - zero normalizations of the absorption lines at z2 , z4 , and z6 , but not at z1 , z3 , or z5 , just as one might expect from visual inspection of figure  1 . to allow for the wavelength calibration uncertainty and for the possibility of small velocity offsets between and /absorption , we refit the spectrum allowing the positions of the z2 , z4 , and z6 lines to vary .",
    "this fit yielded offsets of @xmath70  and @xmath71  at z2 and z6 , within the wavelength calibration uncertainty , while the offset at z4 was significantly larger .",
    "we then repeated the model fit a final time , this time fixing the z2 and z6 line positions to these best - fit values and the z4 line position to the original value based on the redshift , with the normalizations of the z2 , z4 , and z6 systems as the free parameters .",
    "table  1 lists the corresponding equivalent widths of the three fitted lines .",
    "the reduction in @xmath72 obtained by adding each of the three lines is @xmath73 , 1.27 , and 2.68 , with a corresponding @xmath74-test statistical significance ( for one additional degree of freedom in each case ) of 99.28% , 83.8% , and 95.8% , respectively .",
    "we therefore classify the z2 and z6 lines , but not the z4 line , as probable detections , significant at the @xmath26 level .",
    "the @xmath4 error bars quoted in table  1 correspond to @xmath75 relative to the model with best - fit parameters .    applying the same procedure at the expected wavelengths of the @xmath5718.969  line yielded a significant detection at z6 , a non - zero value at z2 , and best - fit normalizations of zero at the other redshifts , just as expected from figure  1 . for the z6 line",
    ", there is a wavelength offset of + 0.0242 , and the reduction in @xmath72 is 3.51 , giving an @xmath74-test significance of 98.03% .",
    "the z2 line reduces @xmath72 by 1.08 ( significance 80.4% ) .",
    "we also searched for absorption in the same way at the expected wavelengths of the @xmath76  and @xmath77  lines .",
    "this analysis yielded a line at the wavelength at redshift z4 , with @xmath78 , and an @xmath79test significance for one additional degree of freedom of 98.3% .",
    "the existence of detectable for this system , which has at best weak and absorption , would be remarkable , implying non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "@xcite find evidence for super - solar ne / o at z@xmath80 . if the detection here is real , the implied ne / o ratio for this system would be higher still .",
    "there were no significant detections of or lines for any of the other systems , nor of x - ray lines from , , , or .",
    "we determined @xmath4 upper limits on the strength of the , , and lines at the redshifts of the remaining systems by adding lines at the expected wavelength and finding the amplitude that produced @xmath75 relative to the smooth continuum model .",
    "these upper limits are listed in table  1 .",
    "the limits for the z3 , z4 , and z5 systems are somewhat less secure than the others because of the complicated form of the continuum in this wavelength region .",
    "we also fit line parameters for the two candidate `` new '' systems discussed earlier , one close to the z3-z4 wavelength ( with @xmath81 ) and one close to the z6 wavelength ( with @xmath82 ) .",
    "the derived equivalent widths and @xmath4 error bars for these systems are listed in table  2 .",
    "although these systems lie within @xmath66 of known redshifts , this condition is much less stringent than that of matching within the @xmath83 wavelength calibration uncertainty , making the probability of chance coincidence much higher .",
    "we therefore attribute substantially less significance to these two candidate systems , even though they are comparable in strength to the `` detected '' and lines listed in table  1 .    our final model for the 2128  region of the spectrum , therefore ,",
    "consists of the continuum model described previously , plus absorption lines at z2 , z4 , z6 , and the `` new '' absorption redshift @xmath81 , plus absorption lines at z2 , z6 , and the `` new '' redshift @xmath82 .",
    "the z4 and z2 features are different from zero at the @xmath27 level , while the other features are different from zero at the @xmath2 level .",
    "figure  2 shows the observed spectrum and this continuum+lines model , over the full 2128  region , and in close - up views near the absorption redshifts .",
    "figure  3 shows the 1418  region in the same fashion . here",
    "the model consists of the continuum with a single absorption line at z4 , which is different from zero at the @xmath84 level .    since the signals we are looking for are weak , and the detection of even one x - ray forest system of great physical import , we have been as meticulous as possible in our data reduction and analysis .",
    "in addition to the analysis reported here , we analyzed several data sets in the archive that have similar instrument set - up to search for any hidden systematic effects , e.g. , instrumental features that would produce artificially low counts in the neighborhood of our detected lines .",
    "we found no evidence for any such effects , and we are therefore confident that the features seen in figures  13 are true properties of the data , not artifacts of the observational or analysis procedures .",
    "the existence of features with @xmath2 significance at several wavelengths predicted _ a priori _ on the basis of absorption suggests that we have indeed detected x - ray forest lines from highly ionized oxygen in these systems .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that the coincidence between observed features and known absorption redshifts is , in fact , just a coincidence .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the probability of obtaining our results `` by chance '' if there were no true signals in the spectrum , since the novelty of the observation was such that we could not define clear `` detection '' criteria in advance of seeing the data .",
    "very roughly , we can note that 3 of the 12 strongest negative deviations in the 2128  region of the residual spectrum lie within the 0.025  wavelength calibration uncertainty of a known redshift .",
    "( this is true for either of the residual spectra shown in figure  1 . )",
    "excluding the problematic 22.223.6  region , there are about 450 channels in this spectral range , and nine absorption wavelengths ( six and three ) that could serve as possible `` matches '' to a given feature .",
    "the wavelength calibration uncertainty gives any of the expected absorption wavelengths a 3-channel range for a `` match , '' so the probability that a randomly selected channel in this wavelength range matches one expected absorption system is about @xmath85 the probability of getting 3 of the 12 strongest deviations matched with known redshifts , in the absence of a true physical correlation , is then @xmath86 multiplied by @xmath87 ( the number of ways that one can choose 3 distinct objects from a set of 12 ) , or about 5% .",
    "since this probability is not extremely small , we will be cautious in interpreting our observations , considering both the possibility that we have true detections of several x - ray forest absorbers and the possibility that we have only upper limits .",
    "the only way to remove this ambiguity is to obtain a higher s / n spectrum with a longer observation .",
    "the high density of weak absorbers establishes them as an important constituent of the low redshift universe .",
    "tsj estimate @xmath88 for absorbers with rest - frame equivalent width @xmath89m , based on _",
    "hst_/stis observations of the h1821 + 643 sightline . while the statistical error on this estimate is large because of the small number of systems , the discovery of an additional low-@xmath90 system by @xcite and of a comparable line density towards pg0953 + 415 by @xcite supports the inference of a high cosmic incidence of absorption ( see @xcite for discussion ) . by constraining the absorption produced by more highly ionized oxygen species ,",
    "our x - ray data provide valuable new constraints on the physical state of the absorbers .",
    "as emphasized by @xcite , photoionization by the cosmic x - ray background can have an important impact on the fractional abundance of and at moderate overdensities , and photoionization by the uv background can strongly influence the fractional abundance of .",
    "we therefore follow the methodology of @xcite and calculate @xmath91 and @xmath92 as a function of density and temperature using the publicly available code cloudy @xcite , incorporating photoionization by the uv background as estimated by @xcite and the soft x - ray background estimated by @xcite . figure  4 shows the fractional abundance of , , , and as a function of temperature for collisional ionization and for collisional + photoionization in gas with hydrogen number density @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 . for @xmath96 ,",
    "these physical densities correspond to overdensities @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , respectively . for reference ,",
    "the overdensity at the `` virial boundary '' of a collapsed halo is @xmath100 in a flat universe with a cosmological constant and @xmath101 , with the precise value depending on the halo profile and on the adopted definition of the virial radius ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at low temperatures and low densities ,",
    "the fractional abundances are strongly influenced by photoionization , while at higher temperatures and densities they approach the abundances expected in collisional equilibrium .",

    "this behavior reflects the competing roles of photoionization and collisional ionization , with the latter being more important for higher temperatures , higher densities , and lower ionization states .    to estimate @xmath91 and @xmath92 for the observed systems , we need to convert line equivalent widths to corresponding column densities for each ion species .",
    "the second column of table  3 lists the column densities and @xmath4 error bars that tsj and @xcite derive by fitting profiles of the 1032  line .",
    "our data do not have the resolution and s / n required for profile fitting , so we instead infer and column densities using the relations for optically thin lines , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the rest - frame equivalent width ( note that the observed - frame equivalent widths in tables  1 and  2 must be divided by @xmath112 before applying these relations ) .",

    "since the fractional errors in column densities are far smaller than those in the or column densities , we have ignored them in calculating the errors on column density ratios .",
    "for the remaining four systems , we plot arrows showing the @xmath4 upper limits on @xmath91 and @xmath92 . since the upper limits on the strength of the x - ray forest lines are roughly constant from system to system , the upper limits on the ion ratios are , to a first approximation , inversely proportional to the column density .",
    "the main exception is the line of the z4 system , for which the best - fit column density is @xmath4 different from zero .",
    "the best - fit @xmath91 ratio of this system lies near the left - hand edge of the horizontal arrow .    at the @xmath27 level ,",
    "our measurements and limits have a number of interesting implications .",
    "first , there are variations in the ion ratios from system to system : the lower limit on @xmath91 for the z2 system is above the upper limit for the z4 and z1 systems , and the lower limit on @xmath92 for the z6 system is above the upper limit for the z4 system . given the sensitivity of the abundance ratios to density and temperature , it is not particularly surprising to find that they vary from system to system , but these results suggest that the diversity in physical properties will be important in understanding the contribution of systems to the baryon budget .",
    "the z2 and z6 systems have higher @xmath124 than the other four systems ( tsj ; @xcite ) , perhaps implying higher gas temperatures that also account for the higher relative abundance of and .",
    "second , the upper limits on the undetected systems restrict their locations in the temperature - density plane  roughly speaking , the absence of detectable provides an upper limit on the gas temperature , and the absence of detectable provides a lower limit on the gas density for a given temperature . for example , the z4 system must have @xmath125 , and if it is close to this temperature , it must have @xmath126 .",
    "third , the overdensities implied by the best - fit line parameters of the detected systems at z2 and z6 are significantly below the values @xmath127 corresponding to virialized systems . in physical terms , the co - existence of detectable amounts of , , and requires that photoionization play a central role in determining the abundance ratios , which is possible only if the density is fairly low .",
    "the last of these conclusions is the most interesting , and also the most surprising . in the case of the z2 absorber ,",
    "the density implied by the best - fit abundance ratios is @xmath128 , corresponding to @xmath129 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath130 , then the path length required to produce the estimated column density @xmath131 is @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the metallicity and we take solar relative abundances , @xmath134 , from @xcite .",
    "this path is rather long for a system of @xmath135 , unless the metallicity is significantly above @xmath136 , but the ion ratios of this system are consistent at the @xmath4 level with a density an order - of - magnitude higher , which would reduce the implied path length by the same factor . the z6 system is more of a puzzle .",
    "taking @xmath137 ( higher than the best - fit value , but easily within the @xmath4 error bar ) , the path length implied by a similar calculation is @xmath138 , which would be long even for @xmath139 .",
    "one possibility , of course , is that the true abundance ratios of this system lie outside the range of our @xmath4 error estimates",
    ". in particular , if @xmath92 is substantially lower than our estimate , then the density of the system could be much higher , and the implied path length shorter .",
    "the implied density would also be higher if the inferred column density has been artificially depressed by saturation .",
    "a third possibility is that the absorber is multi - phase , with the ( and perhaps ) absorption arising in hotter gas . in this case",
    ", the ion ratios do not yield accurate constraints on the density .",
    "higher s / n observations could rule out ( or confirm ) the first possibility , and good constraints on the line width from uv observations could address the second , but the last is an unavoidable source of systematic uncertainty in the interpretation of measurements like these .",
    "unfortunately , our constraints at the @xmath7 level are rather weak .",
    "the and fractions of the detected systems are consistent with zero at the @xmath140 level .",
    "one can see the approximate @xmath7 upper limits for these systems in figure  5 by adding log@xmath141 to the points .",
    "similarly , one obtains approximate @xmath7 upper limits for the undetected systems by adding log@xmath142 to the @xmath4 upper limits shown in figure  5 . the conclusion that @xmath8 , with a tighter upper limit for stronger absorbers , holds robustly , but stronger physical constraints on the systems at the @xmath7 level require higher s / n than our present observations afford .",
    "what can we say about the contribution of absorbers to the cosmic baryon budget ?",
    "tsj estimate this contribution based on their stis observations of h1821 + 643 , using the equation @xmath143^{-1 } \\right\\rangle     \\sum_i n_i(\\ovin ) ~. \\label{eqn : omb1}\\ ] ] here @xmath144 is the critical density , @xmath145 is the absorption distance interval @xcite probed by the observations , and @xmath146 is the column density in system @xmath147 .",
    "the factor @xmath148^{-1}$ ] converts the column density of a system to the hydrogen column density , and the average represented by @xmath149 should be weighted by column density for equation  ( [ eqn : omb1 ] ) to hold .",
    "in fact , @xmath150 should be inside the @xmath149 as well , but since our observations give no additional purchase on the metallicity , we will assume that it is constant from system to system .",
    "adopting uniform values of @xmath11=-1 $ ] and @xmath151 , tsj find @xmath152 . since @xmath151 is close to the maximum possible fraction ,",
    "tsj interpret this estimate as a lower limit on @xmath153 for @xmath11=-1 $ ] .",
    "more generally , we can express the tsj result as @xmath154}}\\right ) \\ ;                  \\left(\\frac{\\langle [ f(\\ovin)]^{-1 } \\rangle}{5.0 } \\right)~. \\label{eqn : tsj}\\ ] ] subsequent observations of three other sight lines @xcite suggest that the density of absorbers towards h1821 + 643 may be higher than average , and that the tsj estimate should perhaps be revised downwards by about a factor of two @xcite .",
    "while small number statistics and the unknown metallicity are both significant sources of uncertainty in the @xmath153 estimates , the major uncertainty in equation  ( [ eqn : omb1 ] ) is the ionization fraction , since @xmath155^{-1 } \\rangle$ ] could quite plausibly be an order - of - magnitude larger than the factor of 5.0 adopted by tsj .",
    "however , since @xmath156 should be close to unity in most systems that have detectable ( see figure  4 ) , it is just this factor that the spectrum allows us to estimate : @xmath157^{-1 } \\rangle \\approx     { \\sum_i n_i(\\ovin ) + n_i ( \\oviin ) + n_i(\\oviiin ) \\over                \\sum_i n_i(\\ovin ) } ~. \\label{eqn : fo6}\\ ] ] the sums in equation  ( [ eqn : fo6 ] ) weight @xmath158^{-1}$ ] by column density , as desired for the @xmath153 estimate .",
    "for our _ estimate _ of @xmath155^{-1 } \\rangle$ ] , we use the measured values of @xmath159 and @xmath160 for the z6 system and of @xmath159 for the z2 system ; we use @xmath161 for the z2 system , and we set @xmath162 for the other four systems . in other words ,",
    "we treat all of our @xmath7 detections as real , but where we have only @xmath4 measurements or upper limits , we conservatively assume the lowest and column densities consistent with the physical expectation that @xmath163 . to obtain a @xmath4 error bar on this estimate , we sum the errors of the three detected x - ray lines in quadrature , and we ignore the much smaller contribution from uncertainty in the column densities . this calculation yields @xmath155^{-1 } \\rangle = 32 \\pm 9 $ ] . combined with the tsj result ( eq .  [ eqn : tsj ] )",
    ", this ratio implies @xmath164 for @xmath11=-1 $ ] .",
    "the statistical error bar here accounts _ only _ for the observational uncertainties in the @xmath159 and @xmath160 measurements , not the uncertainty due to the small number of systems along the single line of sight employed in the analysis , which is probably at least as important .",
    "furthermore , each of our detected features is consistent with zero at the @xmath140 level , and we can not rule out the possibility that the apparent association between these features and redshifts is coincidental . nonetheless , this analysis of the spectrum of h1821 + 643 provides the first direct evidence ( a ) that the column density - weighted mean value of @xmath158^{-1}$ ] , is substantially higher than the conservative value of 5.0 that tsj and @xcite used to derive lower limits on @xmath153 , and ( b ) that as a result , the baryon fraction associated with absorbers substantially exceeds that of any other known low redshift baryon component , representing an appreciable fraction of the baryons predicted by bbn .",
    "the combined column density of the candidate `` new '' and lines is comparable to that of the three lines at redshifts , so these systems , if real , would represent a hotter igm component containing a similar baryon fraction .",
    "the estimate of @xmath155^{-1 } \\rangle$ ] requires that we treat the @xmath7 lines as real detections .",
    "more conservatively , we can derive an upper limit on @xmath155^{-1 } \\rangle$ ] , without taking a stand one way or the other on the reality of the detections .",
    "of course , since our conservative estimate already implies @xmath153 of the same order as @xmath165 , these upper limits are not very restrictive . for the @xmath4 upper limit , we carry out the sum in equation  ( [ eqn : fo6 ] ) including @xmath160 from the z2 system and @xmath159 from the z4 system , and we add to it the quadrature sum of the @xmath4 errors on @xmath159 and @xmath160 for all six systems , dividing the total by @xmath166 . for the corresponding @xmath7 upper limit ,",
    "we simply double the error bars on each system .",
    "the result is @xmath155^{-1 } \\rangle < 60 $ ] at @xmath4 and @xmath167^{-1 } \\rangle < 79 $ ] at @xmath7 . in combination with the tsj or @xcite numbers , even the @xmath4 upper limit is consistent with @xmath168 .",
    "if we had obtained null results for all of the systems , then the upper limit on @xmath153 would have come out well below @xmath169 .",
    "lines with observed - frame @xmath170m , or lines with @xmath171m , would have appeared in our data unambiguously , with significance @xmath172 .",
    "we can clearly rule out the existence of such systems along this line of sight . if we exclude the @xmath173  region , then the observable path length for the systems is @xmath174 and for systems @xmath175 .",
    "we therefore estimate that the number density of such systems is @xmath176 in each case . for poisson statistics , the probability of finding no systems",
    "where three are expected is @xmath177 , so the 95% confidence limit on the density of strong and lines is @xmath178 .",
    "in fact , even the existence of the systems that we have detected at the @xmath26 level is rather surprising relative to theoretical expectations .",
    "for igm metallicity @xmath11=-1 $ ] , hydrodynamic simulations predict one system per unit redshift above column density @xmath179 , with a similar result for , and a rapid decline in the line density for higher column density thresholds .",
    "we base this statement on figure  7 of @xcite , but the comparisons in that paper suggest that the @xcite or @xcite simulations would yield similar results for the same metallicity assumption , at least within a factor @xmath180 . adding scatter to the igm metallicities increases the probability of finding strong or systems , since there are more low ( total ) column density systems to scatter to high ( oxygen ) column densities than _",
    "vice versa_. with the metallicity scatter predicted by @xcite , the line density predicted by @xcite falls to @xmath181 at thresholds of @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "it remains surprising to find @xmath184 systems ( two if we count only those at redshifts , four if we count the candidate `` new '' systems ) with column density in excess of @xmath185 in a path length of @xmath186 .",
    "the incidence of absorption towards h1821 + 643 appears to be higher than average @xcite , and the same could be true for and absorption .",
    "nonetheless , accounting for the systems reported here within the framework of the @xmath187cdm cosmological model ( or at least the chen et al .",
    "[ @xcite ] simulation of it ) requires that some regions of the shock - heated igm be enriched to metallicities several times higher than @xmath11=-1 $ ] , and it probably requires that the frequency of such enriched regions be higher than the @xcite model predicts .",
    "confirmation of the observed systems at higher s / n , and correspondingly improved estimates of the and column densities , would allow firmer assessment of the theoretical predictions for x - ray forest absorption .",
    "in combination with the _ hst _ and _ fuse _ observations of absorption , this _ chandra _ spectrum of h1821 + 643 provides the most direct evidence to date for the pervasive , moderate density , shock - heated igm predicted by leading cosmological models .",
    "the spectrum shows absorption signals with @xmath2 significance at the expected wavelengths of and absorption for one of the systems , at the expected wavelength of absorption for another , and at the expected wavelength of absorption for a third .",
    "there are two absorption features of comparable strength within @xmath64 of predicted and absorption wavelengths , which could represent additional absorbing gas in the large scale environment of the systems",
    ". some of the other @xmath188 features in the spectrum could correspond to x - ray forest systems without associated absorption , but these features are present in roughly the number expected for gaussian noise , so without an _ a priori _ reason to search for absorption at their observed wavelengths , we have no convincing evidence that they represent physical systems .",
    "there is a clear detection of galactic absorption , and a strong , broad feature at 25.35 for which we have no obvious identification .",
    "the best estimates of the ratios @xmath189 and @xmath190 for the two detected systems imply that they are largely photoionized and that gas densities are significantly below those expected in virialized structures like groups or clusters .",
    "this inference relies on the assumption that the , , and absorption arise in the same gas , not in different components of a multi - phase system .",
    "independent of the single - phase assumption , the measured ratios imply that the column density - weighted mean value of @xmath158^{-1}$ ] is substantially higher than the value of 5.0 that tsj used to derive their lower limits on @xmath153 , the baryon density associated with absorbers .",
    "tsj and @xcite find @xmath191 for @xmath11=-1 $ ] and @xmath158^{-1}=5 $ ] , and our results imply that @xmath155^{-1 } \\rangle = 32 \\pm 9 $ ] at @xmath4 . at face value , therefore , our measurements suggest that the baryon fraction associated with absorbers is substantially larger than that in stars , cold gas , or hot gas detected in x - ray emission , and that the absorbers trace a significant reservoir of the `` missing '' low redshift baryons .",
    "the candidate and systems that are not at the redshifts contain a similar total amount of highly ionized oxygen . in combination with the results of hydrodynamic simulations @xcite ,",
    "the existence of even one or two x - ray forest lines at the column densities of our detected systems suggests that some regions of the shock - heated igm have been enriched to well above @xmath11=-1 $ ] , and the oxygen and hydrogen column densities measured for the z2 absorber suggest @xmath11\\ga -0.3 $ ] in this system .",
    "unfortunately , our results also show that definitive measurements of x - ray forest absorption are extraordinarily difficult , even with the great technological advance that _ chandra _ , letg , and acis - s represent over previous instruments .",
    "the absorption signals for the detected systems differ from zero at only the @xmath26 level , and since we detect some but not all of the known systems , we can not rule out the possibility that the apparent association between these features and predicted absorption redshifts is simply a coincidence .",
    "the features at other wavelengths are not strong enough to represent clear detections of new systems .",
    "the constraints on the physical properties and associated baryon fraction of the absorbers are very interesting at the @xmath4 level , but with @xmath7 error bars we obtain only loose constraints that are not particularly surprising , though they are still more than was previously known . _ xmm - newton _ has larger effective area than _ chandra _ at soft x - ray wavelengths .",
    "however , the effective area near 25  is non - uniform , with many instrumental features at observationally interesting wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , published spectra obtained with rgs at these wavelengths seem to achieve lower resolution than _",
    "chandra_/letg , reducing the sensitivity to narrow lines .",
    "it is not clear , therefore , whether _ xmm - newton _ will prove as powerful as in x - ray forest searches .",

    "_ mission .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ can at best give us a glimpse of what these future missions may achieve .",
    "however , the tantalizing but still ambiguous hints of x - ray forest absorption in the h1821 + 643 spectrum would be frustrating to live with for half a decade or more . in our view",
    ", the best step forward in the study of the x - ray forest would be further _",
    "chandra _ observations of h1821 + 643 , which remains the best target for such an investigation because of its x - ray brightness and",
    "well studied absorption , and because the _ chandra _ spectrum presented here provides 500 ksec of existing data and clear objectives for a future observation .",
    "for example , an additional 1 msec observation would reduce the noise in the co - added spectrum by @xmath192 , so any true physical features that have @xmath7 significance in the current spectrum would rise to @xmath193 significance , making their reality entirely unambiguous , regardless of whether they lie at the redshift of a known system .",
    "conversely , since we obtain @xmath4 upper limits @xmath194 and @xmath195 for systems with no absorption signal in the current spectrum , the @xmath4 upper limits in undetected systems from a co - added 1.5 msec spectrum would imply @xmath196^{-1}$ ] and @xmath197^{-1}$ ] , respectively .",
    "these constraints are still not extremely strong for any individual system , but null detections for all of the known systems in such a spectrum would suggest that the total amount of material they contain is not enough to represent the main reservoir of the missing low redshift baryons .",
    "_ chandra _ observations can also guide the design of x - ray forest studies with future missions .",
    "if the apparent detections in our current spectrum represent real systems , then _ constellation - x _ is likely to find an abundance of x - ray absorption lines tracing the enriched , shock - heated igm .",
    "conversely , if the evidence for these features weakens as the s / n improves , then tall trees in the x - ray forest are rare , and even _ constellation - x _ will have to search long and hard to find them .",
