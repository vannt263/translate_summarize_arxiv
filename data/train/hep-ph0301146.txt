    "at high energies a new factorization theorem emerges , the @xmath1-factorization or semihard approach @xcite .",
    "the relevant diagrams are considered with the virtualities and polarizations of the initial partons , taking into account the transverse momenta @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the incident partons .",
    "the processes are described through the convolution of off - shell matrix elements with the unintegrated parton distribution , @xmath4 .",
    "the latter can recover the usual parton distributions in the double logarithmic limit by its integration over the transverse momentum @xmath1 exchanged gluon .",
    "the matrix elements computed for the relevant subprocesses within this approach are more involved than those needed in the collinear approach already at lo level . on the other hand , a significant part of the nlo and some of the nnlo corrections to the lo contributions on the collinear approach , related to the contribution of non - zero transverse momenta of the incident partons ,",
    "are already included in the lo contribution within the semihard approach @xcite .",
    "moreover , part of the virtual corrections can be resummed in the unintegrated gluon function @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "a very important issue is the consistency of the approach including nonleading - log effects and the collinear factorization beyond leading order @xcite : the coefficient functions and the splitting functions providing @xmath5 and @xmath6 are supplemented with the all - order resummation of the @xmath7 contributions at high energies , in contrast with a calculation in fixed order perturbation theory .",
    "two additional ingredients should be taken into account when calculating observables at high energies : treatment for the infrared sector and saturation effects .",
    "the unintegrated gluon function should evolve in transverse momentum through the bfkl evolution at high energies , leading to the diffusion on @xmath1 of the initial gluons in the evolution process . in this diffusion scenario",
    "the transverse momenta values are spread out into the infrared ( and ultraviolet ) region , where the perturbative description is not completely reliable .",
    "the recently calculated non - linear corrections to the bfkl approach @xcite introduce a natural treatment for these difficulties , where the saturation scale @xmath8 provides the suitable cut - off controlling the infrared problems .",
    "as the bjorken variable @xmath9 decreases , unitarity corrections become important and control the steep growth of the gluon distribution . the most appealing approach taking into account",
    "both the notions of infrared behavior ( confinement ) and parton saturation phenomenon is the saturation model @xcite , which is an eikonal - type model based on the color dipole picture of high energy interactions . in this contribution",
    "we discuss some aspects of the calculation of heavy quark photoproduction using the saturation model within the semihard approach .",
    "we address ref .",
    "@xcite for complete details and discussions .",
    "the differential cross section for the heavy - quark photoproduction process is expressed as the convolution of the unintegrated gluon function with the off - shell matrix elements @xcite , @xmath10 where the off - shell lo matrix elements are given by @xcite . the final expression for the photoproduction total cross section considering the direct component of the photon",
    "can be written as @xcite , @xmath11\\,\\left ( \\frac{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ p$}}_{1\\perp}}{d_1 } + \\frac{({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ k$}}_{\\perp}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ p$}}_{1\\perp})}{d_2 } \\right)^2 +    m_q^2 \\,\\left(\\frac{1}{d_1 } + \\frac{1}{d_2 }   \\right)^2   \\right\\}\\ , , \\label{eq:11 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here",
    ", @xmath14 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and @xmath15 is the electric charge of the produced heavy - quark .",
    "details on the relevant variables and kinematics can be found at @xcite .",
    "the scale @xmath16 in the strong coupling constant in general is taken to be equal to the gluon virtuality , @xmath17 , in close connection with the blm scheme @xcite . in the leading @xmath18 approximation ,",
    "@xmath19 should take a constant value .",
    "when the transverse momenta of the incident partons are sufficiently smaller than those from the produced heavy - quarks , the result from the collinear approach is recovered .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) the unintegrated gluon function was allowed to depend also on the scale @xmath20 , taken here as @xmath21 , since some parametrizations take this scale into account in the computation of that quantity ( see , for instance ref .",
    "the total and differential cross sections for the process can now be calculated , provided a suitable input for the function @xmath22 . in what follows we use",
    "one of the simplest parametrization available , covering a consistent treatment of the infrared region and taking into account the expected saturation effects at high energies .",
    "these features are nicely rendered in the phenomenological saturation model @xcite .",
    "the unintegrated gluon distribution from that model , supplemented by the threshold factor ( taking into account the large @xmath23 behavior ) , is given by @xcite , @xmath24    we have used the parameters from @xcite , which includes the charm quark . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sigtot ] ) the charm and bottom total cross sections are presented . for sake of comparison ,",
    "the saturation model is contrasted with the unintegrated gluon function given by the derivative of the collinear gluon distribution ( labeled d - gluon ) @xcite .",
    "the saturation model slightly underestimates high energy data , since the treatment of qcd evolution is not considered in the original model .",
    "recent improvements , taking qcd evolution into account , should cure this shortcoming @xcite .",
    "the derivative of the collinear gluon distribution gives a better description of high energy data , since it includes the referred gluon emission .",
    "the disagreement with the low energy data can be solved by introducing the sudakov form factor @xcite . for sake of illustration",
    ", we also show the parton model results ( collinear approach ) for the lo process @xmath25 , where it has been used @xmath26 gev , @xmath27 gev , and @xmath28 .",
    "this gives a reasonable description of data given the use of lower heavy quark masses or alternatively considering higher order corrections to the lo calculation .",
    "in contrast , the semihard approach gives a reasonable description of data already at lo level .",
    "the energy dependence is distinct in the calculations : the saturation model provides a mild energy growth , whereas in the collinear approach the growth is steeper .",
    "a related study considering also the resolved photon component and extended calculations to the heavy quark production in two - photon process can be found in ref .",
    "an analysis of the heavy quark transverse momentum distributions can also be found in ref ."
