    "in many ways the study of random graphs traces its history back to the seminal work of erds and rnyi showing that there exists a rapid transition between the regimes of a random graph consisting of many small components , a random graph having one `` giant '' component , and a random graph being connected  @xcite .",
    "because of their central role in the history of random graphs these phase transitions have been extensively studied , see for instance @xcite , among numerous others .",
    "we contribute to this ongoing discussion by providing a sharp transition for the emergence of both the giant component and connectivity for the stochastic kronecker graph , a generalization of the standard erds - rnyi binomial random graph model , @xmath3 .",
    "more formally , recall that the kronecker or tensor product of two matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a matrix @xmath6 . for @xmath7 , j \\in [ n ] ,",

    "that is , each edge @xmath16 is present independently with probability @xmath17 .",
    "the stochastic kronecker graph was originally proposed as a model for the network structure of the internet with the property that it could be easily fit to real world data , especially in the case where the generating matrix was @xmath18 $ ] where @xmath19  @xcite . as such",
    ", there have been several papers analyzing structural properties of the stochastic kronecker graph when the generating matrix is a @xmath20 matrix  @xcite .",
    "most relevant to this current work are the results of mahdian and xu  @xcite who anaylzed the connectivity , diameter , and the emergence of the giant component with @xmath21 , and the work of the first author and horn who analyzed the emergence and size of the giant component for arbitrary @xmath22  @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider the case of an arbitrarily sized generating matrix , and develop necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of the giant component and connectivity .",
    "the key tool to analyzing these graphs is to tie the structure of the graph to a fixed markov chain on the underlying generating matrix . using this underlying structure",
    ", one can analyze the graph structure more completely than with traditional tools .",
    "given a @xmath12-order stochastic kronecker graph with generating matrix @xmath13 , we define @xmath23 to be the weighted graph on @xmath24 $ ] , where weights are as given in @xmath13",

    "we also define the backbone graph of the matrix @xmath13 , @xmath27 , as the subgraph of @xmath23 consisting of the edges assigned weight 1 .",

    "the slightly unnatural seeming condition on the backbone graph @xmath29 is simply the condition needed to assure that @xmath26 has no isolated vertices .",
    "the folklore in the study of random graphs asserts that , in general , the giant component should emerge when the average expected degree is 1 , see for instance @xcite .",
    "as the average expected degree in a @xmath12-order stochastic kronecker graphis @xmath51 , this suggests that the transition occurs when @xmath52 .",
    "however , as parts ( [ m : small ] ) and ( [ m : giant ] ) of theorem [ t : master ] show , the transition actually occurs when @xmath53 . noting that the expected degrees in stochastic kronecker graphs follow a multinomial distribution ( see section [ defsec ] ) , this condition can be seen as equivalent ( asymptotically ) to the condition that _ median _ expected degree is at least one .",
    "thus our results may suggest that the average expected degree is not as deeply connected to giant component as previously thought , because in many of the standard random graph models , such as the erds - rnyi  random graph , the average and the median expected degree agree .",
    "that is , it may be that the median is truly the determining factor for such structures .",
    "it is also worth noting that spencer has conjectured based in part on @xcite , that the correct intuition is that the emergence of the giant component is tied to the second order average degree  @xcite .    to prove theorem [ t : master ] , we will develop several general results on @xmath26 , and then apply these results to the specific situations above . in particular , we are able to tie the adjacency structure of @xmath26 to a finite state markov chain on @xmath25 . using this association , we can take advantage of the finite structure of @xmath25 to build theory regarding the asymptotically growing structure @xmath26 .",

    "let @xmath56 be the column sums of @xmath13 ( note that we can assume these are nondecreasing without loss of generality ) , and let @xmath57 be the diagonal matrix of column sums in @xmath13 .",
    "we note that there are multiple means of describing the entries of the probability matrix @xmath15 to take advantage of the kronecker product structure .",

    "we will often identify the vertex to its corresponding word , and write @xmath59 .",
    "given an appropriate choice of bijection , for any two vertices @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the probability that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are adjacent is @xmath62 that is to say , we take the product of entries of the generating matrix @xmath13 , where entries correspond to the pairs of components in the words representing @xmath60 and @xmath61",

    "first we note that @xmath377 as otherwise the only edges present in @xmath25 are those present in the backbone graph , and in particular , @xmath25 is a perfect matching contradicting the non - bipartiteness .",

    "in fact , based on the work in @xcite , it is likely that similar transition points will hold . that is , the multiplicative attribute graph will have a giant component when the median expected degree is 1 and become connected when the probability of an isolated vertex goes to zero .    perhaps a more interesting direction would to resolve the size of the largest component in the case when @xmath516 . by letting @xmath517",

    "thus it seems likely that in order to understand the size of the largest component of the stochastic kronecker graph when @xmath519 it will require a deeper understanding of why the branching process for @xmath520 terminates with a largest component of size @xmath521  @xcite .    as a possible intermediate stage ,",

    "since the degree of every vertex is still asymptotically poisson with parameter 1 , the branching process point of view would indicate that the size of the largest component should be @xmath526 .",
    "however , we note that if @xmath241 is the @xmath522-regular graph formed by two copies of @xmath527 joined by a perfect matching , then @xmath304 consists of @xmath528 copies of @xmath529 with relatively few edges between them . furthermore , as the expected degree within each of these copies of @xmath529 is @xmath530 , the largest component in each of these components is @xmath531 , seemingly indicating that the overall size of the largest component is relatively small .",
