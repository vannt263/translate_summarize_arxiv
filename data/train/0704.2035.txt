    "quantum coherence , which is due to a fixed relative phase between wave functions of a quantum system , may be manifested in a unipartite or a multipartite system .",
    "various types of nonclassical properties , which have their origin in quantum coherence , have been discussed for a unipartite system , particularly , in the context of quantum optics  @xcite . quantum coherence in a multipartite system can give a strong correlation between particles , which can not be explained by classical theory  @xcite .",
    "this , so - called entanglement , is a key ingredient for quantum information protocols such as quantum cryptography  @xcite , teleportation  @xcite , and computing  @xcite .",
    "when a quantum system is embedded in the real world environment , it is known that decoherence degrades the entanglement even more rapidly than the quantum coherence of a unipartite system .",
    "it is thus important to study the decoherence of entanglement in order to find ways of circumventing it .",
    "it has been shown that entanglement bears some connection to nonclassicality manifested by a unipartite system . indeed , in order to see entanglement in the gaussian output fields of a beam splitter , at least one of the two input field modes_partite system _ ' .",
    "] has to be squeezed ( squeezing is a nonclassical nature of a field )  @xcite . when an antibunched field ( antibunching is another nonclassical nature of a field ) and the vacuum are input to a beam splitter , the output fields have also been shown to be entangled  @xcite .",
    "quantum coherence manifested in a unipartite system or multipartite correlations suffers from the effects of decoherence . adding thermal noise with the amount of two units of vacuum fluctuations rules out any nonclassicality , initially imposed in the single mode field  @xcite .",
    "however , when a nonclassical field is embedded in a vacuum environment via linear and passive interaction ( pure loss ) , it takes infinite time for the nonclassicality to disappear completely  @xcite .",
    "this is also true for some entangled states which have been generated from gaussian nonclassical states with linear devices  @xcite . in a sense",
    ", one may say that nonclassicality and entanglement are rather `` tolerant against the decoherence in a vacuum environment . ''",
    "recently , it was pointed out  @xcite that the tolerance in a vacuum is not universal for entanglement ; for some entangled qubits , pure or impure , their entanglement vanishes at `` finite '' time even when they are in a vacuum .",
    "this has also been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "it is likely that a certain class of entangled states are tolerant in a vacuum whereas others are disentangled earlier , which has been dubbed as `` sudden death of entanglement '' ( sde ) .",
    "as the entanglement is a key resource of quantum information , the finite time disentanglement is clearly an unwanted effect . since the passive interaction with a local vacuum bath , in the form of loss and inefficient detection , is an intrinsic part of quantum information protocols relying on quantum optics , it is useful to specify state parameters and interaction strengths when there is no danger of sde s occurring . in this paper",
    "we attempt to clarify a class of entangled states that are tolerant against the decoherence in local vacuum environments .",
    "for this purpose we derive sufficient conditions for infinite - dimensional systems whose entanglement is not completely destroyed in finite time during the decoherence in vacuum .",
    "the sufficient conditions enable us to clarify a class of bipartite entangled states which preserve their entanglement , in other words , are tolerant to a vacuum decoherence .",
    "we then briefly consider two - qubit systems and , with help of both our criteria and a qubit entanglement measure , discuss their behavior with respect to vacuum decoherence .",
    "suppose that subsystem @xmath0 of a multipartite system @xmath1 interacts _ linearly and passively _ with a vacuum environment @xmath2 . in this physical situation , subsystem @xmath0 loses its energy to the vacuum .",
    "such vacuum decoherence is described by a dynamic evolution of the density matrix @xmath3 for the whole system @xmath1 .",
    "if the system is initially in state @xmath4 and its subsystem @xmath0 starts to interact with the vacuum in @xmath5 , then the evolved state @xmath6 at a certain interaction time @xmath7 is given by @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 stands for the unitary operation coupling subsystem @xmath0 and the vacuum @xmath2 .",
    "the relation in eq .",
    "( [ decoh1 ] ) describes the single - channel decoherence when subsystem @xmath0 interacts with its vacuum environment .",
    "decoherence of additional channels can be straightforwardly incorporated by employing series of the corresponding single - channel decoherences , as long as the subsystems interact with an independent environments .",
    "we also note that , even though the environment responsible for the decoherence consists of many modes , a single - mode bath can equivalently describe the decoherence if a time - dependent coupling replaces the coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "the unitary operation @xmath10 of the passive linear interaction transforms annihilation operators of respective modes @xmath0 and @xmath2 as  @xcite @xmath11 up to some overall phase factor . here",
    ", @xmath12 represents the time - dependent coupling between the system and the environment .",
    "when the system is fully assimilated to the environment , @xmath13 .",
    "when the system is in its initial state , @xmath14 . for optical systems ,",
    "this decoherence implies a linear loss which is caused , for example , by unwanted absorption and/or reflection of optical components , imperfect mode - matching or inefficient detection .",
    "another elegant way to obtain the decohered quantum state is to employ the kraus representation . in this approach ,",
    "the evolved density matrix is given in the form + @xmath15 the kraus operators @xmath16 satisfy the completeness relation of @xmath17 and they are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ decoh1 ] ) as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the creation operator for mode @xmath0 .",
    "the decoherence in vacuum , discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : ii ] , is fairly benign for single - mode nonclassicality .",
    "nonclassicality can be represented by a lack of proper probability distribution , in other words , by the existence of singularities or negative values in the glauber - sudarshan distribution  @xcite .",
    "the density operator @xmath20 of a quantum state can be represented by the glauber - sudarshan distribution @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a coherent state of amplitude @xmath24 .",
    "the decoherence in a vacuum implies the decrease of amplitude with rate @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 [ see the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ decoh2 ] ) ] and it leads to rescaling of the glauber - sudarshan distribution , @xmath27 .",
    "thus it is clear that the decoherence in a vacuum does not completely destroy the nonclassicality of the single - mode field .",
    "a similar conclusion can be arrived at for a multimode system . however , for entanglement , which is the nonclassicality in inter - mode correlations , such a conclusion does not always hold .",
    "that is , the entanglement can vanish even though nonclassicality still persists during decoherence .",
    "as an example of the situation , when entanglement prevails for infinite time , consider an entangled state generated at the two outputs of a beam splitter by injecting a nonclassical field and a vacuum into the respective input ports @xcite .",
    "if both modes of the entangled state undergo the same amount of vacuum decoherence , the vacuum decoherence channels can be , formally , placed either before or after the beam splitter - the effects are equivalent .",
    "this implies that the generated entanglement is never completely lost in the vacuum decoherence , as the initial nonclassicality never is .",
    "the situation does not change if the modes of the entangled state are affected by different amounts of vacuum decoherence . in this case ,",
    "additional decoherence , an operation that can not increase entanglement , can be applied locally to transform the scenario to the previous one .",
    "however , in order to observe the dynamics of entanglement in general , we require reliable criteria of separability ( or measures of entanglement ) to test the entanglement of a decohered state . a necessary and sufficient criterion derived in ref .",
    "@xcite states that a quantum state @xmath20 is separable if and only if the image operator @xmath28 is a physical state , for each positive map @xmath29 and an identity map @xmath30 .",
    "matrix transposition is most often employed as a positive map @xmath29 , resulting in the well - known criterion of negative partial transposition ( npt )  @xcite .",
    "the npt criterion is sufficient but not necessary for arbitrary - dimensional systems to be entangled even though it is a necessary and sufficient condition for small - dimensional systems , i.e. , @xmath31 and @xmath32 systems .",
    "the implementation of the npt criterion also requires the complete knowledge of the full density matrix and this can pose certain problems , especially for infinite dimensional systems .",
    "therefore , attempts have been made to use the npt as a base of construction for criteria that are easier to implement , such as the simon criterion , employing second - order statistical moments , which is necessary and sufficient for the class of gaussian states  @xcite .",
    "however , to accommodate for a wider set of entangled states it was necessary to employ higher statistical moments of annihilation and creation operators , as in @xcite . to investigate whether and when the entanglement of a two - mode field vanishes by vacuum decoherence , we use the shchukin - vogel criterion .",
    "this criterion states that , for an entangled state , there exists a hermitian matrix of moments , @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the determinant of @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements , @xmath36 are certain moments of annihilation and creation operators for the two modes @xmath0 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 @xmath20 is the density operator for a two - mode field , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 are proper components of multi - indices @xmath42 and @xmath43  @xcite .    consider a subset of the shchukin - vogel hierarchy such that matrix elements @xmath44 are formed entirely by normally ordered moments ( nom ) for mode @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that @xmath45 is a submatrix of @xmath33 , formed by moments of operators @xmath46 where the multi - indices are now @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "note that the subset of @xmath49 discriminates a certain set of states to be entangled , still forming a sufficient criterion of entanglement .",
    "this particular set will be called the @xmath0-mode nom class of entangled states .",
    "one can perform a similar procedure for both modes @xmath0 and @xmath37 instead of the single mode , and obtains the @xmath50-mode nom class of entangled states .",
    "the quantum state @xmath51 of the two - mode field at the interaction time @xmath7 can be calculated for an initial state @xmath52 as in eq .",
    "( [ decoh1 ] ) if one of the two modes interacts with a vacuum environment , say mode @xmath0 . then the @xmath0-mode nom matrix elements @xmath53 for @xmath51 are obtained as @xmath54     \\nonumber \\\\     & = &   { \\mathrm{tr}}\\left[\\rho_{ab}(0)\\langle 0|_r u_{ar}^{\\dag }       \\mathcal{m}_{ij}^{n_a}(a , a^{\\dag},b , b^{\\dag } ) u_{ar}|0\\rangle_r \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\    & = &   { \\mathrm{tr}}\\left[\\rho_{ab}(0 )   \\mathcal{m}_{ij}^{n_a}(\\sqrt{\\eta}a,\\sqrt{\\eta}a^{\\dag},b , b^{\\dag})\\right ]   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the shchukin - vogel determinant , @xmath55 , is in the form of @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath0-mode nom matrix of the initial state and the matrix @xmath58 is diagonal with various powers of @xmath25 .",
    "this relation between @xmath55 and @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : svcsmnomc ] ) means that _ any entangled state belonging to the @xmath0-mode ( or @xmath50-mode ) nom class remains entangled by the vacuum decoherence in mode @xmath0 ( or modes @xmath0 and @xmath37)_. note that in case of the single - mode decoherence the condition is less strict , as it requires only operators corresponding to the decohering mode to be normally ordered .",
    "the same conclusion is also true for all states proven inseparable by the criteria , recently proposed by hillery and zubairy  @xcite .",
    "this is because all the moments used in their hierarchies are normally ordered and the value of any particular criterion @xmath60 transforms under the vacuum decoherence as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the order of the member of the hierarchy , and the sign does not change .",
    "this condition also ensures that under the vacuum decoherence , the entanglement of gaussian states is never lost .",
    "this follows directly from the realization that duan s necessary and sufficient criterion for separability of gaussian states  @xcite is one normally ordered criterion of the shchukin - vogel hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "other states whose entanglement behave in this way include coherent superposition states @xmath63 , the density matrix of the system after the decoherence being , in analogy with ( [ decoh1 ] ) , @xmath64.\\ ] ] writing the coherent state with help of the displacement operator @xcite , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , allows us to use the relation @xmath67 and to write the equation ( [ coh1 ] ) in the form @xmath68d_a(-\\alpha e^{i\\phi}\\sqrt{1-\\eta})^{\\dag}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of entanglement , this is clearly the same result as in the case of vacuum environment , as the only difference is in a single mode displacement , which is irrelevant to entanglement of the state .",
    "therefore , any states that are robust against vacuum decoherence are also robust when the decoherence is caused by a passive interaction with coherent environment .",
    "finally , as far as the authors are concerned , there has been no report on finite time disentanglement caused by vacuum decoherence for systems other than qubits @xcite .",
    "although this is implied by geometric considerations in @xcite , using the existence of both entangled and separable states in a neighbourhood of the vacuum state , it is not shown whether evolution trajectories leading to finite time disentanglement really exist .",
    "alternatively , attempts at specific analysis have to deal with a lack of necessary criteria of entanglement for generic high dimensional hilbert space ( hs ) , dealing only with lower bounds of entanglement @xcite and again only suggesting that finite time disentanglement may take place . here we present another way of showing a possibility of disentanglement .",
    "it relies on using the inverse of the decoherence map ( [ decoh3 ] ) , @xmath69 with @xmath70 this map is not positive and , if applied to an arbitrary state , it may result in an unphysical state .",
    "if the resulting state is physical , though , it is exactly the state that will decohere into the initial one .",
    "it is now possible to consider an arbitrary separable state of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and apply the inverse decoherence map ( [ decohinv ] ) on one or both the subsystems of the state .",
    "if the resulting state is physical , commonly used entanglement criteria such as npt can be used to decide upon entanglement of the state .",
    "as an example we have considered a bipartite state spanning hs of the dimension 3 .",
    "the state was subject to inverse decoherence ( [ decohinv ] ) , with @xmath73 and varying parameter @xmath12 , .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ ln ] , it can be seen that although the state becomes nonphysical around @xmath74 , it is npt entangled roughly when @xmath75 . here ,",
    "the entanglement is quantified by means of logarithmic negativity @xcite , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the trace norm and @xmath78 stands for partially transposed density matrix of the state .",
    "thus it can be seen that the finite time disentanglement caused by the vacuum decoherence is not limited to qubit systems .",
    "the particular state under discussion can be found in fig .",
    "[ statefig ] .",
    "let us consider the vacuum decoherence in a bipartite qubit system .",
    "although the two - dimensional hs of qubits can be seen just as a subspace of general infinite - dimensional space of continuous variables with base states limited to  vacuum \" and  single photon \" , it is an important area of physics on its own , describing , for example , spin systems and two - level atoms in cavities .",
    "we are going to use base states @xmath79 and @xmath80 to be consistent throughout the paper , but the states could also be denoted as @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( ground and excited states of an atom ) or @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( spin up , spin down ) .",
    "the noise model ( [ decoh3 ] ) corresponds to decoherence by amplitude damping which , in case of atoms in cavity , is caused by spontaneous emission of photon by the excited atom . of course , all operators @xmath16 for @xmath85 transform the density matrix into zero .    in the qubit case",
    ", the npt criterion serves as a necessary and sufficient condition for entanglement and therefore conclusive results about the dynamics of entanglement under the decoherence can be obtained .",
    "this allows us to find specific conditions for disentanglement and compare them to those obtained with help of the formalism presented so far .",
    "although the non - positivity of partially transposed density matrix serves as a necessary and sufficient criterion for separability , it is useful to quantify the entanglement by means of wootters concurrence  @xcite @xmath86,\\ ] ] where @xmath87 are eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath88 arranged in decreasing order . here , @xmath89 stands for the off - diagonal pure imaginary pauli matrix .",
    "the value of concurrence ranges from @xmath90 for separable states to @xmath91 for maximally entangled qubit states containing one e - bit of entanglement . in the following",
    "we shall omit the notion of maximum , using the term concurrence for @xmath92 , but bearing in mind that it has good meaning only when positive .",
    "let us suppose a pure state of the general form @xmath93 the concurrence of this state is @xmath94 and the state is initially entangled if @xmath95 .",
    "if we let both particles of this system decohere according to ( [ decoh3 ] ) with the same decoherence coefficient @xmath12 , the decohered density matrix would be + @xmath96 where the kraus operators can be expressed in matrix form @xmath97 applying these , we can find the eigenvalues required for ( [ conc ] ) to be @xmath98 ^ 2,\\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\lambda_2 & = &    \\eta\\left[|\\alpha\\delta-\\beta\\gamma|-\\sqrt{|\\alpha\\delta-\\beta\\gamma|^2+|\\delta|^4(1-\\eta)^2}\\right]^2,\\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\lambda_3 & = & \\lambda_4 = \\eta^2(1-\\eta)^2|\\delta|^4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the concurrence is readily obtained as @xmath99 where the superscript @xmath100 denotes that we are considering decoherence of both particles of the system .",
    "this clearly shows that for pure states of the form ( [ pure ] ) with @xmath101 the entanglement is , under the vacuum decoherence , never completely lost @xcite .",
    "there is an alternative way to arrive at this conclusion , using the result in section  [ sec : iii ] .",
    "it follows from realization that when detecting entanglement of any pure bipartite qubit state using the shchukin - vogel criteria , the value of determinant composed of moments ( [ momentsno ] ) , with indices @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which are normally ordered in both modes , reads @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , for states with @xmath106 , the condition obtained is the same as in the case of concurrence . if @xmath107 it is possible to consider a matrix of moments @xmath108 , @xmath102 and @xmath104 whose determinant is @xmath109 .",
    "we should keep in mind that , although it is not the case for these examples , this approach requires the state to be defined in the first two dimensions of general hs .",
    "however , it may be also interesting to study what happens if the same initial state is affected by decoherence of only one of the subsystems . in this case",
    "it shows that the entanglement of _ all _ pure qubit states is not completely lost in a finite time , suggesting an inherent difference between single- and two - mode decoherence . to show this",
    ", the needed kraus matrices are @xmath110 with relevant eigenvalues @xmath111 giving the concurrence , @xmath112 , which is always positive .",
    "the superscript @xmath113 denotes the single - particle decoherence .",
    "therefore , single - particle vacuum decoherence never causes initial pure state to disentangle completely .",
    "again , the result in section  [ sec : iii ] can be used as an alternative : the determinant of a @xmath114 matrix composed of moments ( [ momentsno ] ) with indices @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath115 is equal to @xmath116 and is negative for all pure states if @xmath106 . if @xmath107 a matrix of moments @xmath108 , @xmath102 and @xmath104 with determinant @xmath109 can be used again .",
    "note , this interesting result suggests that given the option between decoherence of both subsystems and stronger decoherence of only one of them , the latter possibility can be more considerate of entanglement .",
    "however , it is only for initially pure states , when this property of single - particle vacuum decoherence always manifests , see @xcite for an example .",
    "we have analysed the evolution of bipartite entangled quantum states under the decoherence caused by passive linear coupling with a vacuum environment . for general , continuous - variable , quantum states",
    "we have found a class of states , whose entanglement will , under the vacuum decoherence , never completely disappear .",
    "we have also shown that this result holds also when decoherence by passive interaction with coherent environment is considered .",
    "furthermore , by means of the inverse decoherence map we have demonstrated that finite time disentanglement is not limited to qubit systems",
    ".    for qubit systems , the existence of necessary and sufficient criteria of entanglement allowed us to explicitly find the conditions of entanglement preservation under both single- and two - mode decoherence and to compare those with the results obtained with help of the general approach laid out in section  [ sec : iii ] .",
    "we have found a good agreement between them , which shows that it is possible to gain some insight into the qubit systems when treating them as a part of the general hs .",
    "there can also be a practical implication of this finding in quantum communication tasks aimed at distributing entanglement between distant parties .",
    "we can consider two elementary scenarios : distributing the both parts of the system via noisy channels or sending just one part of the system via noisy channel with double the noise . in light of our result",
    "it is apparent that the first scenario can lead to complete disentanglement while the second one always preserves at least some entanglement , leaving the possibility of entanglement purification opened .",
    "note , that this reasoning can also be applied to infinite dimensional hs states whose entanglement can be verified only by criteria based on moments normally ordered in just one of the subsystems .    _",
    "note added : _ since our submission , it has been shown that for a two - qubit state the entanglement reduction under a noisy channel acting on one of the subsystems is independent on the initial state but completely determined by the channel s action on the maximally entangled state @xcite .",
    "this can be seen as a generalisation of our finding about entanglement of a pure qubit state which is never completely lost under the single channel decoherence .",
