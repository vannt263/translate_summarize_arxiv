    "our position inside the milky way galaxy allows us to make observations at a much higher spatial resolution that we could do in other disk galaxies .",
    "but that same fact makes it much more difficult to infer the large scale characteristics of our home galaxy .",
    "a lot of the current questions of the spiral structure of the milky way could be resolved if we knew the position and full velocity vector of the observed gas .",
    "numerical studies of large scale galactic structure have proved to be very valuable in discerning the sought after characteristics .",
    "nevertheless , this is a very complicated problem and , so far , it is impossible to include all the physics involved .",
    "therefore , modelers must decide which parts of the problem are not going to be considered , in the hope that those neglected will have little influence in the overall conclusions .",
    "the models presented here do not include self - gravity of the gas , supernova explosions or other energetic events , and have uncomfortably low spatial resolution .",
    "they include a substantial magnetic field , a high thermal pressure ( to represent tangled fields , cosmic rays , and subgrid turbulence ) , and the extra degree of freedom of three dimensions .",
    "we believe these are definitive factors that have not been sufficiently explored .",
    "the thermal pressure was also adjusted to drop sharply at high densities to encourage the formation of denser structures .    in the first two papers of this series (",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* papers i and ii from here on ) , we presented the results of our simulations of the ism response to a spiral gravitational perturbation .",
    "we showed that the extra stiffness that the magnetic field adds to the gas makes it develop a combination of a shock and a hydraulic jump with significant complications added by vertical bouncing .",
    "this jump / shock leans upstream above the plane ( more in the two - arm models than the four - arm ones ) , ahead of the main gas concentration in the midplane .",
    "as it shocks , the gas shoots up to higher @xmath2 in a way similar to water jumping over an obstacle in a riverbed .",
    "the gas then accelerates as it runs over the arm , and falls down behind it , generating a secondary set of shocks . in the two - arm cases",
    ", the gas bounces back up , generating interarm structures that mimic the ones found at the arms .    in this work",
    ", we ll focus in the four - arm case , designed to have spiral arms similar to those traced by @xcite , as modified by @xcite . in figure [ arms ]",
    "we show the surface density of the four - arm model from paper ii , along with the aforementioned arm pattern , and the corresponding position of the sun .",
    "notice that the scale of the spiral arms has been reduced so that the distance from the sun to the galactic center is @xmath3 , as in our model . in section [ all_sky_sec ]",
    "we present all sky column density maps in radial velocity ranges ; in section [ lv_sec ] we present synthetic longitude - velocity diagrams ; in section [ vb_sec ] we present velocity - latitude diagrams , which we believe have a definite signature of these models ; in section [ rotcurve_sec ] we present the rotation curve that would be measured in this galaxy as affected by the spiral arms ; in section [ distances_sec ] we analyze its effect on the measured kinematic distances in the galactic plane ; in section [ corotation_sec ] we examine the rotation of gas above the midplane ; in section [ synch_sec ] we present an all sky synchrotron map ; and in section [ conclusions_sec ] we present our conclusions .",
    "figure [ all_sky ] shows a map of the integrated column density of the simulation , as seen from the position of the observer marked in figure [ arms ] , in galactic coordinates .",
    "the grayscale shows the column density , with contours in a geometric sequence and labeling in units of @xmath4 .",
    "( the reader should keep in mind that our model spans only from @xmath5 through @xmath6 in radius , and up to @xmath7 in @xmath2 .",
    "the shaded region in the galactic center direction shows the angular extent of the central `` hole '' in our simulation grid .",
    "in addition , the full strength of the perturbation is applied only for @xmath8 , and therefore , the useful part of the grid extends from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . ) two vertical protuberances are clear in this figure , corresponding to the directions tangent to the sagittarius arm , at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "imprints corresponding to other arms are also present ; they are harder to pick up in this figure , but become evident when we restrict the line - of - sight integration to certain velocity ranges , as in figure [ all_sky_vel ] .",
    "( a map with the line - of - sight component of the velocities for the midplane is presented in figure [ radial_vel ] ) .",
    "the perseus arm appears in all the velocity ranges , but it is more prominent in @xmath13 at negative velocities , and @xmath14 at @xmath15 . also prominent are : a superposition of the perseus , scutum and norma arms at between @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath18 ; the sagittarius arm from @xmath19 to @xmath20 at intermediate negative velocities , with a very large vertical extension ; and a superposition of the sagittarius and scutum arms at from @xmath16 to @xmath21 for large positive velocities .",
    "the diagram for @xmath22 features three large column density elements .",
    "the one at @xmath23 corresponds to the sagittarius arm . at @xmath16 to @xmath24 , we see a narrow stripe of the whole inner galaxy , including the perseus , scutum , and sagittarius arms .",
    "the third element , at @xmath25 , corresponds to a tangent direction through the region between the sagittarius and perseus arms , in which lower density gas spans a large distance with a small range of velocities .",
    "longitude - velocity diagrams are a straightforward way of presenting the data - cubes , and it is relatively easy to extract information about global properties of the galaxy .",
    "figure [ lv_4 ] shows a longitude - velocity diagram , as seen by an observer situated as marked in figure [ arms ] , at galactic latitude @xmath26 .",
    "again , the shaded region marks the region around the galactic center that we do not include in our model .",
    "several features can be pointed out .",
    "the rotation curve , as traced by the extremum velocity of the gas in the inner galaxy , has small deviations from a flat curve which are not symmetric about @xmath27 ( see section [ distances_sec ] ) . even without velocity dispersion intrinsic to the gas in the model",
    ", there is a fair amount of gas moving at forbidden velocities in the general direction of the galactic anticenter ( positive in the second quadrant , negative in the third ) .",
    "also , the gas in the anti - center direction has a positive mean velocity , while the envelope of the emission averages to zero at @xmath28 .",
    "these characteristics depend strongly on the chosen position for the observer .",
    "features similar to these are observed in @xmath0 diagrams from milky way s surveys , although details ( like the longitude of the zero velocity around the anticenter ) do not necessarily coincide with our model .",
    "the proximity of our outer boundary ( @xmath5 in the anticenter direction ) might have some influence on this .",
    "ridges and intensity enhancements in this diagram are usually interpreted as spiral arms . since in our model",
    "we have the advantage of knowing exactly where the material is and with which velocity it is moving , we can trace the gaseous spiral arms into the simulated @xmath0 diagram .",
    "we found the position of the spiral arms by fitting , for each radius in the simulation grid , a sinusoidal function along azimuth to the vertical column density of the gas .",
    "figure [ arms_locus ] presents the result of the fit , while figure [ lv_arms ] traces the spiral arms into the @xmath0 diagram .",
    "most of the ridges in this diagram correspond to spiral arms , although the relation is not one - to - one . for example , around @xmath29 , at the perseus arm , the line of sight goes through a large velocity gradient , which spreads the arm in velocity , and diffuses the ridge . the converse also happens : lower intensity ridges that are not related to spiral arms are generated when the velocity gradient is small , and large spatial extents condense into a small velocity range , for example , at @xmath30 .",
    "the capacity of the velocity field to create or destroy structures in this diagram with little regard of the underlying gas density has been long known @xcite .",
    "another natural way of presenting data cubes is the velocity - latitude diagram . for our model ,",
    "the @xmath1 diagram shows the signature of the vertical structure of the spiral arms .",
    "figure [ latvel_75 ] shows the @xmath1 diagram for the @xmath31 direction .",
    "the position chosen for the observer places it just downstream from the sagittarius arm , where the gas is falling down . therefore , figure [ latvel_75 ] shows gas with negative velocities at large galactic latitudes .",
    "this is consistent with the observations by @xcite , the wham project @xcite , and other authors , which found that gas around the galactic poles has a mean negative velocity .",
    "notice the higher intensity ridge that runs from @xmath32 at @xmath33 to about @xmath34 at the galactic pole .",
    "that ridge is generated by crowding of the falling gas in velocity space . a spectrum taken toward those latitudes would show a line that could be interpreted as a cloud , although the gas has no spatial concentration .",
    "figure [ latvel_75_zoom ] zooms into a @xmath35 region around the galactic midplane .",
    "examination of figure [ radial_vel ] shows that such line - of - sight crosses the perseus arm at @xmath36 and the norma arm at @xmath37 , very close to the simulation edge . at those approximate velocities , figures",
    "[ latvel_75 ] and [ latvel_75_zoom ] , show `` mushroom '' shaped structures , with a relatively narrow , horizontal stem and large vertical cap on the left edge of the stem .",
    "these are the characteristic signatures of the vertical structure of the gaseous arms , along with a tendency of the tip of the cap to bend slightly back over the stem , to less negative velocities at higher latitude .    in order to guide the following discussion , we present in figure [ dist_lat_75 ] the density ( grayscale ) and line - of - sight component of the velocity ( contours ) along a vertical plane in the @xmath38 direction .",
    "since we are looking at the arm from the concave side , the gas moves through it from left to right , though not parallel to the plane of the figure .",
    "the reader should keep in mind that these velocities are the result of the presence of the arms on top of the galactic rotation .",
    "if the gas were in purely circular orbits , we should see positive velocities up to the solar circle , at a distance of @xmath39 , and then negative velocities , monotonically decreasing until the edge of the grid .",
    "this general pattern is found in the figure , with velocities increasing from 0 to @xmath40 at @xmath41 , then back to zero at @xmath42 , going increasingly negative , though not monotonically , beyond that .",
    "let us concentrate on the perseus arm , at about @xmath43 .",
    "just upstream from the arm , there is a vertically thin distribution of material formed by the downflow from the sagittarius arm .",
    "the encounter of this material with the arm decelerates the gas , appearing as a rapid succession of decreasing velocity contours at @xmath44 .",
    "that velocity gradient spreads the vertically thin gas structure along the horizontal axis of the @xmath1 diagram , creating the stem structure in the midplane . beyond @xmath45 , we have the vertically swelled structure of the arm itself , which appears in figure [ latvel_75_zoom ] as the vertically extended mushroom cap . between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the gas is speeding up above the arm increasing its line - of - sight velocity , causing the tip of the cap to slightly bend back over the stem .",
    "( the reversal of this trend between @xmath48 and @xmath49 involves a very small amount of material very close to the vertical boundary and could be an artifact . ) within the arm , the radial velocity has one or more extremes , creating caustics as the gas doubles back in velocity space .",
    "this behavior repeats as we approach the norma arm , but we reach the simulation boundary before developing the full arm structure , and we get only the stem and the beginning of the cap .",
    "when we restricted the integration to the thin preshock interarm region , we noticed that its @xmath1 imprint is very small .",
    "but , as seen in figure [ dist_lat_75 ] , the true `` interarm '' region is much broader and includes the high @xmath2 part of the cap of the previous arm , after the midplane density has decreased .    in figure [ latvel_off ] , the @xmath1 diagram for the simulation in the @xmath50 direction",
    "is compared with the equivalent diagram for the leiden / dwingeloo survey @xcite .",
    "the now familiar mushroom structures appear again at the approximate velocities of the spiral arms , along with the characteristic gap between caps of successive arms . at other galactic longitudes ,",
    "the observed pattern is less regular , presumably due to galactic complexities not found in our model .",
    "notice that , in the survey data , the galactic warp displaces the mushroom structures off the @xmath51 plane , while restrictions in the simulation does not allow such symmetry break .",
    "in order to estimate the influence of the spiral arms on measurements of the galactic rotation curve , we measured it in the simulation in a way that emulates how it is measured in the milky way . for gas inside the solar circle",
    ", we picked a galactic longitude .",
    "we then looked for the maximum velocity along the line - of - sight ( minimum for negative longitudes ) and assumed that it arises from the tangent point and , therefore , the gas at that galactocentric radius moves with that extreme velocity . by repeating this procedure for an array of galactic longitudes",
    ", we can trace the rotation curve interior to the solar circle .",
    "figure [ rotation_curve ] shows the results .",
    "the dotted line shows the case for the northern galaxy , while the dashed line shows the rotation curve for the southern galaxy . for comparison ,",
    "the rotation curve that arises from the hydrostatic plus rotational equilibrium in the initial conditions is presented as the continuous line .    the observed rotation curve ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* when scaled for @xmath52 ) is systematically higher in the range @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) than in the corresponding negative longitudes by some @xmath55 .",
    "the converse happens in the @xmath56 range ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this behavior and the amplitude of the oscillations are reproduced by our simulations , although around @xmath58 , the difference between our rotation curves , @xmath59 , is somewhat larger than observed .",
    "an important use of the rotation curve is the estimation of distances in the galaxy , by assuming that the target moves in a circular orbit . in this section",
    "we try to estimate the error in those distances .",
    "the fact that the calculated curve falls below the rotation set by the rotational hydrostatics and the background potential ( figure [ rotation_curve ] ) creates lines of sight in which the gas never reaches the velocity that direction should have in circular orbit , and therefore , if this `` true rotation '' is used to estimate distances , no gas would be assigned to those regions .",
    "if we imagine the galaxy as made of rubber and being distorted by the distance errors , the picture obtained would have large holes in those regions .",
    "for this reason , and for self - consistency , we used the rotation curve derived in section [ rotcurve_sec ] .    since we have the privileged information of where the gas really is",
    ", we can estimate the error created by assuming that the gas moves in circular orbits with the adopted rotation curve . at a given distance along a fixed longitude direction ,",
    "we take the velocity of the gas given by the simulation , and calculate at what distance the circular orbit assumption puts it .",
    "even if the rotation curve has oscillations , the line - of - sight velocity of the gas in circular orbits might remain monotonic on either side of the tangent point , provided that the oscillations are not too large ( as can be seen in figure [ dist_lat_75 ] , that is not the case above the plane , but here we focus in the distances along the midplane ) .",
    "therefore , there is still only a two - point ambiguity in the assigned distance .",
    "we solve that ambiguity by cheating : we place the gas parcel on the side of the tangent point we know it to be .",
    "figure [ dist_err ] shows the error in the estimated distance along the @xmath60 direction . in order to compare these errors to the spiral arms ,",
    "the density is plotted also ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "although it depends on the galactic longitude , the distances tend to be over - estimated around the arms and under - estimated in the interarms by a varying amount , typically smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "gas moving at forbidden velocities can not be given a location with this method .",
    "kinematics of the gas above the galactic plane has been studied as a test for models for the galactic fountain , which in turn are used to explain the ionization of the ism at high @xmath2 ( see discussion in miller & veilleux 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the velocity resolution achieved for external galaxies makes it difficult to estimate rotation velocity gradients over the vertical distance our models span , and therefore comparison is difficult .",
    "nevertheless , we present in figure [ corota ] a synthetic spectrum that could be obtained by placing the slit perpendicular to the galactic plane , at a distance of @xmath61 from the galactic center .",
    "three spiral arm crossings are clear in this picture , at @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( respectively , as we move away from the observer ) .",
    "notice that the arms show a leaning toward higher velocity as we move up , due to the gas speeding up over them after the shock .",
    "also , the arm at @xmath64 spreads over a range of velocities , since we look at it at a smaller angle .",
    "the right limit of the emission in this diagram is usually associated with the rotation of the galaxy .",
    "that maximum velocity is not reached at the point of smallest radius , the tangent point , but the offset is quite small ( @xmath7 or less ) .",
    "that point corresponds to an interarm region , where the gas falls back down to the plane , and slows down as it moves out in radius .",
    "therefore , near the midplane , this maximum velocity falls below the rotational velocity that we get when repeating this exercise at a different radius .    as in previous cases ,",
    "not all the ridges in this plot correspond to density structures , but are generated by velocity crowding .",
    "such is the case of the element at @xmath65 around @xmath66 , which is generated by a plateau of nearly constant velocity in a region with density lower than its surroundings , which have a larger spread in velocity .    from figure [ corota ]",
    ", we would infer that the velocity maximum increases some @xmath67 up to @xmath68 , and then comes back down to @xmath69 around @xmath70 .",
    "when placing the slit at a different position , we get similar behavior , with different amplitudes and at different heights .",
    "@xcite observed a similar behavior in a couple of galaxies in their sample , although with a larger velocity amplitude .",
    "those seem to be exceptions , since most of the galaxies in their sample do not show significant gradients .",
    "the amplitude of the velocity gradient in this model would have been difficult to detect with the resolution achieved in their study .",
    "figure [ sync_lon ] shows an all sky map of the synchrotron emission .",
    "the grayscale corresponds to the total synchrotron intensity , while the direction of the magnetic field , as inferred from the polarization of the integrated emission , is presented in dashes .",
    "the synchrotron emissivity is given by    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line - of - sight , @xmath73 is the spectral index of the distribution of cosmic ray electrons , @xmath74 is its space density , @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite . for each @xmath77 direction , this emissivity is integrated , and the direction of the polarization is accounted for by the process described in paper ii .",
    "the degree of polarization of the integrated emission is generally high , varying from @xmath78 in the midplane and in the @xmath79 and @xmath80 at all latitudes , to @xmath81 in four isolated regions toward @xmath82 .",
    "this is expected , since our resolution does not allow us to model the random component of the field .    to help with the discussion of this map , we present the midplane magnetic field in the simulation in figure [ mag_pitch ] , reproduced from paper ii .",
    "the grayscale represents the surface density , and the dashes follow the direction of the magnetic field , with its length proportional to the field strength .",
    "recalling figure [ arms ] , the second and third quadrants have interarm gas nearby .",
    "the perseus arm is @xmath83 away in the @xmath84 direction , and @xmath85 away toward @xmath86 . in that @xmath87 range , near the midplane",
    ", the magnetic field has a negative pitch angle .",
    "this has the effect that the field is pointing directly toward the observer , and the plane - of - the - sky component is very small , causing the low emission at low latitudes in figure [ sync_lon ] . around the @xmath88 direction ,",
    "that negative pitch angle increases the component of the field projected in the sky , causing a higher emission in the @xmath89 range . on the other hand ,",
    "the field above the plane twists more abruptly , with a smaller negative pitch region , yielding a short path length to integrate over and leaving only a small imprint on this plot . as a consequence , off the galactic plane ,",
    "we see a pattern in the sky that resembles that of a circular field : horizontal in the @xmath79 and @xmath80 at all latitudes , and in the midplane , at all longitudes ; nearly vertical off the plane in the @xmath90 and @xmath20 directions ( the sky projection of an overhead circle ) .",
    "although the sign of the radial component of the field changes between the arm and interarm regions , those changes are not enough to account for the changes in the differential rotation measure that are typically interpreted as reversals in the direction of the galactic magnetic field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "by placing an imaginary observer inside the modeled galaxy from paper ii , we generated various synthetic observations .",
    "since we actually know where the gas is , we can distinguish which parts of the model are generating the observed structures .",
    "in particular , velocity crowding effects can be distinguished from real spatial concentrations .",
    "the synthetic @xmath0 diagram has common characteristics with the observed diagram , although some similarities are only in a qualitative level .",
    "again , velocity crowding generates ridges that do not correspond to spiral arms .",
    "but the converse also happens , as a large velocity gradient can dilute a spiral arm in velocity space . in the @xmath1 diagram ,",
    "on the other hand , velocity crowding and dilution generate structures that test the vertical distribution of matter and velocity above the arms presented in papers i and ii .",
    "such structures can be observed in the leiden / dwingeloo survey .",
    "we also explored the rotation curve that the imaginary observer would measure from within the model galaxy .",
    "several of the characteristics of this measured rotation curve are also observed in the curve measured for the milky way , being higher in some radial ranges than on the opposite side of the galactic center .",
    "this agreement is probably a consequence of our having tried to fit the positions of the spiral arms in our model to the proposed positions for the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , the measured rotation curve has large deviations with respect to the rotation from our initial conditions , which is also influenced by pressure gradients and magnetic tension and is therefore slightly different from the rotation consistent with the background gravitational potential .",
    "although the magnetic field is largely non - circular , the averaging effect of the synthetic synchrotron maps generates a largely circular imprint , with exception of the midplane . as mentioned in paper ii , restrictions in our model limit the amount of vertical field that our model generates , increasing the circularity of the field and diminishing the vertical extent of the synchrotron emission .",
    "the ism of the milky way galaxy is very complex system , in which many different physical processes combine to generate large scale structure .",
    "the extra freedom of the third dimension and the dynamical effects of a strong magnetic field , in our view , are two key elements in the formation of such structures . until we find a way of reliably measuring distances to the diffuse components of the disk , velocity crowding effects will keep blurring and distorting the pictures we generate . more realistic modeling with higher resolution , inclusion of gas self - gravity , and stellar feedback ( including cosmic ray generation and diffusion ) is necessary to further clarify that picture .",
