    "extremely high energy ( ehe ) cosmic rays beyond @xmath1 have been observed in a couple of decades @xcite , but their origin still remains enigmatic . in regard to the generation of the ehe particles ,",
    "there are two alternative schemes : the `` top - down '' scenario that hypothesizes topological defects , z - bursts , and so on , and the traditional `` bottom - up '' ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . in the latter approach ,",
    "we explore the candidate celestial objects operating as a cosmic - ray `` zevatron '' @xcite , namely , an accelerator boosting particle kinetic energy to zev ( @xmath3 ) ranges . by simply relating the celestial size to the gyroradius for the typical magnetic field strength",
    ", one finds that the candidates are restricted to only a few objects ; these include pulsars , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , radio galaxy lobes , and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , gamma - ray bursters ( grbs ) are known as possible sources @xcite . as for the transport of ehe particles from the extragalactic sources , within the gzk horizon",
    "@xcite the trajectory of the particles ( particularly protons ) ought to suffer no significant deflection due to the cosmological magnetic field , presuming its strength of the order of @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "according to a cross - correlation study @xcite , some super - gzk events seem to be well aligned with compact , radio - loud quasars .",
    "complementarily , self - correlation study is in progress , showing small - scale anisotropy in the distribution of the arrival direction of ehe primaries @xcite .",
    "more recently , the strong clustering has been confirmed , as is consistent with the null hypothesis of isotropically distributed arrival directions @xcite . at the moment",
    ", the interpretation of these results is under active debate .    in the bottom - up scenario , the most promising mechanism for achieving ehe",
    "is considered to be that of diffusive shock acceleration , which has been substantially studied for solving the problems of particle acceleration in heliosphere and supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) . in general , it calls for the shock to be accompanied by some kinds of turbulence that serve as the particle scatterers @xcite . concerning the theoretical modeling and its application to extragalactic sources such as agn jets , grbs , and so forth , it is still very important to know the actual magnetic field strength , configuration , and turbulent state around the shock front .",
    "at this juncture , modern polarization measurements by using very long baseline interferometry began to reveal the detailed configuration of magnetic fields in extragalactic jets , for example , the quite smooth fields transverse to the jet axis ( 1803 + 784 : * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another noticeable result is that within the current resolution , a jet is envisaged as a bundle of _ at least _ a few filaments ( e.g. , 3c84 : @xcite ; 3c273 : @xcite ) , as were previously confirmed in the radio arcs near the galactic center ( gc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as in the well - known extragalactic jets ( e.g. , cyga : @xcite , @xcite ; m87 : @xcite ) .",
    "the morphology of filaments can be self - organized via the nonlinear development of the electromagnetic current filamentation instability ( cfi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) that breaks up a uniform beam into many filaments , each carrying about net one unit current @xcite . fully kinetic simulations indicated that this subsequently led to the coalescence of the filaments , self - generating significant toroidal ( transverse ) components of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "as could be accommodated with this result , large - scale toroidal magnetic fields have recently been discovered in the gc region @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we conjecture that a similar configuration appears in extragalactic objects , particularly agn jets @xcite . it is also pointed out that the toroidal fields could play a remarkable role in collimating plasma flows @xcite . relating to this point ,",
    "the agn jets have narrow opening angles of @xmath5 in the long scales , although in close proximity to the central engine the angles tend to spread ( e.g. , @xmath6 for the m87 jet ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , there is observational evidence that the internal pressures are higher than the pressures in the external medium ( e.g. , 4c32.69 : @xcite ; cyga : @xcite ; m87 : @xcite ) .",
    "these imply that the jets must be _ self_-collimating and stably propagating , as could be explained by the kinetic theory @xcite .    in the nonlinear stage of the cfi",
    ", the magnetized filaments can often be regarded as strong turbulence that more strongly deflects the charged particles .",
    "when the shock propagation is allowed , hence , the particles are expected to be quite efficiently accelerated for the dsa scenario @xcite .",
    "indeed , such a favorable environment seems to be well established in the agn jets .",
    "for example , in the filamentary m87 jet , some knots moving toward the radio lobe exhibit the characteristics of shock discontinuity @xcite , involving circumstantial evidence of in situ electron acceleration @xcite .",
    "as long as the shock accelerator operates for electrons , arbitrary ions will be co - accelerated , providing that the ion abundance in the jet is finite ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is , therefore , quite significant to study the feasibility of ehe particle production in the filamentary jets with shocks : this is just the original motivation for the current work .",
    "this paper has been prepared to show a full derivation of the diffusion coefficient for cosmic - ray particles scattered by the magnetized filaments .",
    "the present theory relies on a consensus that the kinetic energy density ( ram pressure ) of the bulk plasma carrying currents is larger than the energy density of the magnetic fields self - generated via the cfi , likely comparable to the thermal pressure of the bulk .",
    "that is , the flowing plasma as a reservoir of free energy is considered to be in a high-@xmath0 state . in a new regime",
    "in which the cosmic - ray particles interact off - resonantly with the magnetic turbulence having no regular field , the quasi - linear approximation of the kinetic transport equation is found to be consistent with the condition that the accelerated particles must be rather free from magnetic traps ; namely , the particles experience meandering motion .",
    "it follows that the diffusion anisotropy becomes small .",
    "apparently , these are in contrast with the conventional quasi - linear theory ( qlt ) for small - angle resonant scattering , according to which one sets the resonance of the gyrating particles bound to a mean magnetic field with the weak turbulence superimposed on the mean field @xcite .",
    "it is found that there is a wide parameter range in which the resulting diffusion coefficient is smaller than that from a simplistic qlt in the low-@xmath0 regime .",
    "we compare a specified configuration of the filaments to an astrophysical jet including agn jets and discuss the correct treatment of what the particle injection threshold in the present context could be .",
    "we then apply the derived coefficient for calculations of the dsa timescale and the achievable highest energy of accelerated particles in that environment . as a matter of convenience",
    ", we also show some generic scalings of the highest energy , taking account of the conceivable energy restrictions for both ions and electrons .    in order to systematically spell out the theoretical scenario ,",
    "this paper is divided into two major parts , consisting of the derivation of the diffusion coefficient (   2 ) and its installation to the dsa model (   3 ) .",
    "we begin , in   2.1 , with a discussion on the turbulent excitation mechanism due to the cfi , so as to specify a model configuration of the magnetized current filaments .",
    "then in   2.2 , we explicitly formulate the equation that describes particle transport in the random magnetic fluctuations . in   2.3 ,",
    "the power - law spectral index of the magnetic fluctuations is suggested for a specific case . in   2.4 , we write down the diffusion coefficients derived from the transport equation . in   3.1 , we deal with the subject of particle injection , and in   3.2 , we estimate the dsa timescale , which is used to evaluate the maximum energy of an accelerated ion (   3.3 ) and electron (   3.4 ) .",
    "finally ,   4 is devoted to a discussion of the feasibility and a summary .",
    "in what follows , given the spatial configuration of the magnetized filaments of a bulk plasma jet , we derive the evolution equation for the momentum distribution function of test particles , which is linear to the turbulent spectral intensity , and then extract an effective frequency for collisionless scattering and the corresponding diffusion coefficient from the derived equation .",
    "respecting the macroscopic transport of energetic particles in active galaxies , there is direct / indirect observational evidence that they are ejected from the central core of the galaxies and subsequently transferred , through bipolar jets , to large - scale radio robes in which the kinematic energy considerably dissipates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this picture",
    ", it is expected that the directional plasma flows will favorably induce huge currents in various aspects of the above transport process ( e.g. , @xcite ; an analogous situation also seems to appear in grb jets : e.g. , @xcite ) . because of perfect conductivity in fully ionized plasmas , hot currents driven in , e.g. , the central engine prefer being quickly compensated by plasma return currents",
    "this creates a pattern of the counterstreaming currents that is unstable for the electromagnetic cfi .",
    "as is well known , the pattern is also unstable to electrostatic disturbances with the propagation vectors parallel to the streaming direction , but in the present work , we eliminate the longitudinal modes , so as to isolate the transverse cfi . providing a simple case in which the two uniform currents are carried by electrons , the mechanism of magnetic field amplification due to the cfi",
    "is explained as follows . when the compensation of the counterpropagating electron currents is disturbed in the transverse direction ,",
    "magnetic repulsion between the two currents reinforces the initial disturbance . as a consequence , a larger and larger magnetic field",
    "is produced as time increases .",
    "for the weibel instability as an example , the unstable mode is the purely growing mode without oscillations @xcite , so the temporal variation of magnetic fields is expected to be markedly slow in the saturation regime ( more on these is given in    2.2 and 2.3 ) .",
    "note that a similar pattern of quasi - static magnetic fields can be also established during the collision of electron - positron plasmas @xcite and in a shock front propagating through an ambient plasma with / without initial magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these dynamics might be involved in the organization of the knotlike features in the fanaroff - riley ( fr ) type  i radio jets , which appear to be a shock caused by high - velocity material overtaking slower material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the cumulative impingement could also take place around the hot spots of the fr type  ii sources , which arguably reflect the termination shocks .",
    "in fact , the filamentary structure has been observed in the hot spot region of a fr  ii source @xcite .",
    "furthermore , estimating the energy budget in many radio lobes implies that the ram pressure of such current - carrying jets is much larger than the energy density of the magnetic fields @xcite ; namely , the jet bulk can be regarded as a huge reservoir of free energy . in this regime ,",
    "the ballistic motion is unlikely to be affected by the self - generated magnetic fields , as is actually seen in the linear feature of jets . as a matter of fact",
    ", the gc region is known to arrange numerous linear filaments , including nonthermal filaments @xcite .",
    "taking these into consideration , we give a simple model of the corresponding current  magnetic field system and attempt to unambiguously distinguish the present system from the one that appears in the low-@xmath0 plasmas hitherto well studied . in figure  1 , for a given coordinate , we depict the configuration of the linear current filaments and turbulent magnetic fields of the bulk plasma . recalling that magnetic field perturbations develop in the direction transverse to the initial currents ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , one supposes the magnetic fields developed in the nonlinear phase to be @xmath7 @xcite , such that the vectors of zeroth - order current density point in the directions parallel and antiparallel to the @xmath8-direction , i.e. , @xmath9 , where the scalar @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is nonuniformly distributed on the transverse @xmath12-@xmath13 plane , while uniformly distributed in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "note that for the fluctuating magnetic field vectors , we have used the simple character ( @xmath14 ) without any additional symbol such as `` @xmath15 , '' since the establishment of no significant regular component is expected , and simultaneously , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) well embodies the quasi - static current filaments in the zeroth order . for convenience ,",
    "hereafter , the notations `` parallel '' ( @xmath18 ) and `` transverse '' ( @xmath19 ) are referred to as the directions with respect to the linear current filaments aligned in the @xmath8-axis , as they are well defined reasonably ( n.b . in the review of   2.4 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 with the subscript `` @xmath22 '' refer to a mean magnetic field line ) .",
    "it is mentioned that the greatly fluctuating transverse fields could be reproduced by some numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in an actual filamentary jet , a significant reduction of polarization has been found in the center , which could be ascribed to the cancellation of the small - scale structure of magnetic fields @xcite , compatible with the present model configuration . in addition",
    ", there is strong evidence that random fields accompany grb jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the arguments expanded below highlight the transport properties of test particles in such a bulk environment , that is , in a forest of magnetized current filaments .",
    "we are particularly concerned with the stochastic diffusion of the energetic test particles injected into the magnetized current filaments ( for the injection problem , see the discussion in ",
    "3.1 ) . as a rule ,",
    "the vlasov equation is appropriate for describing the collisionless transport of the relativistic particles in the turbulent magnetic field , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and the slow temporal variation has been taken into consideration .",
    "transverse electrostatic fields are ignored , since they preferentially attenuate over long timescales , e.g. , in the propagation time of jets ( see   2.3 ) .",

    "apparently , this is also in contrast to the conventional qlt for small - angle resonant scattering , which invokes a mean magnetic field ( well defined only for the case in which the turbulence is weak ) in ordinary low-@xmath0 plasmas .    in any case , in equation  ( [ eqn:19 ] ) we specify the spectral intensity of the random magnetic fields , which are established via the aforementioned mechanism of the electromagnetic cfi .",

    "the hierarchy is illustrated in figure  2 , indicating the characteristic trajectories of those particles .",
    "when shock propagation is allowed , as seen in actual agn jets , the shock accelerator can energize the particles in each energy level . at the moment , we are particularly concerned with ehe particle production by a feasible scenario according to which energetic free particles , unbound to small - scale structure of the magnetized filaments , are further energized by the shock . in this aspect , the particle escape from magnetically bound states , due to another energization mechanism , can be regarded as the injection of preaccelerated particles into the concerned diffusive shock accelerator . if the preaccelerator , as well , is of dsa , relying on the gyromotion of bound particles @xcite , the preaccelerator also calls for the injection ( in a conventional sense ) in a far lower energy level , owing to , e.g. , the maxwellian tail , or the energization of particles up to the energies where the pre - dsa turns on ( for a review , see * ? ? ? * ) . the energy required for this injection , the so - called injection energy ,",

    "this scattering property can be compared to that for the conventional qlt in low-@xmath0 regimes : an unperturbed ( zeroth order ) guiding center trajectory of gyrating particles bound to a mean magnetic field must be a good approximation for many coherence lengths of particle scatterer .    if both the injection and transition injection work , the multistep dsa can be realized .",
    "in the stage of @xmath235 , many acceleration scenarios that have been proposed thus far ( dsa : e.g. , @xcite ; shock drift acceleration : e.g. , @xcite ; some versions of the combined theories : e.g. , @xcite ; for a review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) can be candidates for the mechanism of the preacceleration up to the energy range of @xmath236 , although before achieving this energy level , the acceleration , especially for electrons , might be , in some cases , knocked down by the energy loss , such as synchrotron cooling , collision with photons , and so on .",
    "the relevant issues for individual specific situations are somewhat beyond the scope of this paper ( observability is discussed in   4 ) . here",
    "we just briefly mention that in the termination regions of large - scale jets where the bulk kinetic energy is significantly converted into the magnetic and particle energies , a conventional dsa mechanism involving large - scale mhd turbulence might work up to ehe ranges ( honda & honda [ 2004b ] for an updated scenario of oblique dsa of protons ) .      in the following ,",

    "let us consider a typical case of @xmath237 in equation  ( [ eqn:31 ] ) , reflecting a reasonable situation that a shock wave propagates along the jet comprising linear filaments . since the vectors of the random magnetic fields are on the plane transverse to the current filaments , this plane is perpendicular to the shock - normal direction .",
    "that is , the shock across the perpendicular magnetic fields is considered . in this case , no irregularity of magnetic surfaces in the shock - normal direction exists , because of @xmath238 . however",
    ", this does _ not _ mean that the particle flux diffusively across the shock surface is in free - streaming ; note that the particles crossing the local fields with nonsmall pitch angles suffer the orthogonal deflection .",
    "anyhow , the injected particles are off - resonantly scattered by the filamentary turbulence , to diffuse , migrating back and forth many times between the upstream and downstream regions of the shock . as a consequence",
    ", a small fraction of them can be stochastically accelerated to very high energy .",
    "this scenario is feasible , as long as the filamentary structure can exist around the discontinuity , as seen in a kinetic simulation for shock propagation @xcite and an actual filamentary jet @xcite .",
    "the timescale of this type of dsa is of the order of the cycle time for one back - and - forth divided by the energy gain per encounter with the shock @xcite . here the cycle time is related to the mean residence time of particles ( in regions i and ii ) , which is determined by the diffusive particle flux across the shock , dependent on @xmath239 ( eq .

    "the key property that should be recalled is that for @xmath364 distant from a filament , the magnetic field strength is likely to slowly decay , being proportional to @xmath365 @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , expected that as long as the radial size of the largest filament , i.e. , correlation length , is comparable to the radius of the jet (   2.3 ) , the long - range field pervades the exterior of the jet , establishing the `` magnetotail '' with the decay property of @xmath366 for @xmath367 .",
    "in fact , in a nearby radio galaxy , the central kiloparsec - scale `` hole '' of the inner radio lobe containing a jet is filled with an ordered , not - so - weak ( rather strong ) magnetic field of the order of @xmath368 @xcite , whose magnitude is comparable to ( or @xmath369 of ) that in the jet @xcite .",
    "presumably , the exuding magnetic field plays an additional role in confining the leaky energetic particles with their long mfp of @xmath370 .    in this aspect ,",
    "let us express an effective confinement radius as @xmath371 , where @xmath372 , and impose the condition that the accelerator operates for the particles with the transverse mfp of @xmath373 .",
    "then the equality gives the maximum possible energy in the form of    @xmath374    values of @xmath354 ( and @xmath362 ) derived from the time balance equation  ( [ eqn:35 ] ) can not exceed that of equation  ( [ eqn:48 ] ) .",
    "it appears that equation  ( [ eqn:48 ] ) can be compared to the energy scaling derived from , in the simplest model , the maximum gyroradius in a uniform magnetic field .      in a manner simiar to",
    "that explained in   3.3 , we find the generic scaling for the achievable highest energy of electrons . in equation  ( [ eqn:34 ] ) for electrons ( @xmath263e  ) , we set @xmath375 and @xmath376 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the method is so analogous that we omit the explanation .      for electrons",
    ", the synchrotron cooling is a familiar loss process , and the timescale can be expressed as @xmath382 . in this expression ,",

    "equation  ( [ eqn:52 ] ) is independent of @xmath315 ( see also eq .  [ [ eqn:41 ] ] ) .",
    "the striking thing is that for plausible parameters , the value of @xmath390 is significantly larger than that obtained in the context of the simplistic qlt invoking the alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "this enhancement is , as seen in equation  ( [ eqn:28 ] ) , attributed to the smaller value of the diffusion coefficient for electrons , which leads to a shorter acceleration time , i.e. , a smaller value of equation  ( [ eqn:33 ] ) , and thereby to a higher acceleration efficiency .      for the case of @xmath391 , the inverse compton scattering of accelerated electrons with target photons can be a dominant loss process .",
    "actually , the environments of agn jets often allow the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) and/or external compton ( ec ) processes .",
    "the characteristic time of the inverse comptonization can be estimated as @xmath392 , where @xmath393 and @xmath394 denote the total cross sections in the thomson limit of @xmath395 and the klein - nishina regime of @xmath396 , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the expression of @xmath380 includes @xmath383 , which is determined by numerically solving the balance equation of @xmath397 .",
    "because of @xmath398 , the value of @xmath383 is found to be in the region of    @xmath399^{1/3 } , \\label{eqn:53}\\ ] ]    in the whole range of @xmath318 .",
    "note that the equality in equation  ( [ eqn:53 ] ) reflects the thomson limit of @xmath400 . substituting the value of @xmath383 into the expression of @xmath380",
    ", we can evaluate the scattering time , which takes a value in the range of    @xmath401    for a given parameter @xmath402 , the larger value of @xmath323 depresses the lower bound of @xmath380 , though the klein - nishina effects prolong the timescale . it should be noted that the evaluation of @xmath380 along equation  ( [ eqn:54 ] ) is , in equation  ( [ eqn:49 ] ) , meaningful only for @xmath403 ; that is , the relation of @xmath404 ensures @xmath405 .    for the case of @xmath397 in equation",
    "( [ eqn:49 ] ) , @xmath383 , conforming to equation  ( [ eqn:53 ] ) , gives the maximum possible energy , which takes the value of    @xmath406    for @xmath403 .",

    "it is found that the klein - nishina effects enhance the value of @xmath390 in the regime of @xmath407 .",
    "note here that @xmath390 can not unlimitedly increase in actual circumstances but tends to be limited by the synchrotron cooling . combining equation  ( [ eqn:52 ] ) with equation  ( [ eqn:55 ] ) , therefore , we can express the allowed domain of the variables as follows :    @xmath408    note that the upper bound reflects the synchrotron limit . in the critical case of @xmath409 reflecting the energy equipartition",
    ", the generic equation  ( [ eqn:56 ] ) degenerates into equation  ( [ eqn:52 ] ) .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission of electrons in the coulomb field of nuclei whose charge is incompletely screened also affects the acceleration .",
    "the timescale can be evaluated by the notation @xmath410 , where @xmath411 is the fractional number density of the target nuclei having charge number @xmath412 and @xmath413 describes the radiation cross section ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when the screening effects are small , for interaction with a heavy composite we have    @xmath414 \\sum_{z^{\\prime}}n_{z^{\\prime}}z^{\\prime 2 } \\right\\}^{-1}~~{\\rm s } , \\label{eqn:57}\\ ] ]    where @xmath411 is in units of @xmath351 .    in the peculiar environments of high density , enhanced metallicity , and lower magnetic and photon energy densities ,",
    "equation  ( [ eqn:57 ] ) may be comparable with equation  ( [ eqn:51 ] ) or ( [ eqn:54 ] ) . in ordinary agn jets , however , the corresponding physical parameters seem to be marginal . note also that the bremsstrahlung timescale for ion - ion interactions is larger , by the order of @xmath415 , than the value of equation  ( [ eqn:57 ] ) , and found to largely exceed the value of equation  ( [ eqn:36 ] ) , namely , the age of the accelerator .",
    "that is why the ion bremsstrahlung has been excluded in equation  ( [ eqn:35 ] ) .",
    "the feasibility of the present model could be verified by the measurement of energetic photons emanating from a source , typically , bright knots in nearby agn jets . in any case , the electrons with energy @xmath390 , given in equation  ( [ eqn:56 ] ) , emit the most energetic synchrotron photons , whose frequency may be estimated as @xmath416 , where the mean field strength @xmath169 has been compared to the rms strength @xmath315 . for @xmath417 as an example , the frequencies of @xmath418 are found to be achieved for @xmath419 . in the gamma - ray bands ,",
    "however , the energy flux of photons from the synchrotron originator is predicted to be often overcome by that produced by the inverse comptonization of target photons . in this case ,",
    "as far as the condition of @xmath420 is satisfied , the boosted photon energy is given by @xmath421 , independent of the target photon energy @xmath318 , thereby irrespective of ssc or ecs .",
    "this is in contrast to another case of @xmath422 , in which one has @xmath423 dependent on @xmath318 .",
    "apparently , for the extremely high energy ranges of @xmath390 achieved in the present scheme , the former condition is more likely satisfied for a wide range of @xmath318",
    ". therefore , in the circumstances that the source is nearby such that collision with the cosmic infrared background , involving photon - photon pair creation , is insignificant , @xmath424 ( @xmath425 ) just gives the theoretical maximum of gamma - ray energy , although the klein - nishina effects also take part in lowering the flux level .",
    "this means , in turn , that a comparison of the @xmath424 value ( multiplied by an appropriate doppler factor ) with the observed highest energy of the compton emissions might constitute a method to verify the present dsa for electrons .",
    "the case for this method is certainly solidified when the operation of the transition injection (   3.1 ) is confirmed . making use of the inherent property that the synchrotron photons emitted by electrons having an energy above @xmath426 reduce their polarization ,",
    "the energy hierarchy can be revealed by the polarization measurements , particularly , with wide frequency ranges and high spatioresolution .",
    "according to the reasoning that the critical frequency above which the measured polarization decreases , @xmath427 , ought to be of the order of @xmath428^{2}[|e{\\bf b}({\\bf r})|/m_{\\rm e}c]$ ] , the related coherence length can be estimated as @xmath429^{3}\\}^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "note that when the locally defined gyroradius reaches this critical scale , the bound electrons are released . in actual circumstances , @xmath430 and the polarization for a fixed frequency band",
    "are , if anything , likely to increase near the jet surface , where the large - scale coherency could appear (   3.3.5 )",
    ". this may be responsible for the results of the polarization measurement of a nearby filamentary jet , which indicate a similar transverse dependence @xcite . in the sense of @xmath431 , the transition injection condition for electrons is more restrictive than that for ions .",
    "thus , observational evidence of the present dsa scenario for energetic electrons will , if it is obtained , strongly suggest that the same scenario operates for ion acceleration , providing its finite abundance .    to summarize",
    ", we have accomplished the modeling of the diffusive shock accelerator accompanied by the quasi - static , magnetized filamentary turbulence that could be self - organized via the current filamentation instability .",
    "the new theory of particle diffusion relies on the following conditions analogous to those for the conventional qlt : ( 1 ) the test particles must not be strongly deflected by a fine filament but suffer the cumulative small deflection by many filaments , and ( 2 ) the transverse filament size , i.e. , the coherence length of the scatterer , is limited by the system size transverse to the filaments ; whereas , more importantly , it is dependent on neither the gyration , the resonant scattering , nor the explicit limit of the weak turbulence .",
    "we have derived the diffusion coefficient from the quasi - linear type equation and installed it in a dsa model that involves particle injection associated with the bound - free transition in the fluctuating vector potential . by systematically taking the conceivable energy restrictions into account , some generic scalings of the maximum energy of particles have been presented .",
    "the results indicate that the shock in kiloparsec - scale jets could accelerate a proton and heavy nucleus to @xmath432 and @xmath433 ranges , respectively .",
    "in particular , for high-@xmath31 particles , and electrons as well , the acceleration efficiency is significantly higher than that derived from a simplistic qlt - based dsa , as is deduced from equation  ( [ eqn:28 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the powerful electron acceleration to @xmath434 ranges becomes possible for the plausible parameters .",
    "we expect that the present theory can be , mutatis mutandis , applied for solving the problem of particle transport and acceleration in grbs @xcite .",
    "the topic is of a cross - disciplinary field closely relevant to astrophysics , high - energy physics , and plasma physics involving fusion science ; particularly , the magnetoelectrodynamics of filamentary turbulence is subject to the complexity of `` flowing plasma . '' in perspective , further theoretical details might be resolved , in part , by a fully kinetic approach allowing multiple dimensions , which goes far beyond the mhd context .",
    "for instruction , we write down the derivation of equations  ( [ eqn:24 ] ) and ( [ eqn:25 ] ) for the collisionless scattering of injected test particles by magnetized current filaments having the configuration illustrated in figure  1 . making use of equation  ( [ eqn:10 ] ) , @xmath149 for @xmath438 ( eq .  [ [ eqn:12 ] ] ) can be explicitly written as          where we have used a standard correlation function ( eq .  [ [ eqn:13 ] ] ) reflecting random magnetic fluctuations on the transverse plane to the linear current filaments ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "recalling the causality principle and noticing that the real part does not contribute to the integration , we get          again , we use an ad hoc equation  ( 16 ) , valid for a quasi - static mode that retains the narrow spectral peak around @xmath445 . assuming that the magnetic turbulence is isotropic on the transverse plane , the angular average of equations  ( [ eqn : a4])([eqn : a6 ] ) is carried out . taking account of the off - resonant scattering of particles by the quasi - static random fields gives          where the ordering and the definition of @xmath123 are the same as those denoted in   2.2 .",
    "for a given momentum distribution function of @xmath137 for the test particles with an ultrarelativistic energy of @xmath449 , the partial derivatives can be estimated as        where @xmath452 and @xmath453 . using equations  ( [ eqn : a10 ] ) and ( [ eqn : a11 ] ) , and equation  ( [ eqn:22 ] ) concerning the @xmath119-space integration for @xmath124",
