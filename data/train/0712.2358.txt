    "computational methods play an increasingly important role in the professional life of many working physicists , whether in experiment or theory , and very explicitly indeed for those doing simulational work , a ` category ' that might not even have been listed separately when some senior physics faculty were students themselves .",
    "that same reality is reflected in the curriculum requirements and course offerings at any number of undergraduate institutions , ranging from specific programming classes required in the major to entire computational physics programs @xcite - @xcite .",
    "at my institution , three of the five options in the physics major require at least one programming course ( from a list including c++ , visual basic , java , and even fortran ) offered by departments outside of physics , so the majority of our majors typically have a reasonable amount of programming experience no later than the end of their sophomore year , in time to start serious undergraduate research here ( or elsewhere , in reu programs ) during their second summer , often earlier . students in our major ,",
    "however , have historically expressed an interest in a course devoted to one of the popular integrated multi - purpose ( including symbolic manipulation ) programming languages such as , maple , or matlab , taught in the context of its application to physics problems , both in the undergraduate curriculum , and beyond , especially including applications to research level problems .    in a more global context ,",
    "studies from physics education research have suggested that computer - based visualization methods can help address student misconceptions with challenging subjects , such as quantum mechanics @xcite , so the hope was that such a course would also provide students with increased experience with visualization tools , in a wide variety of areas , thereby giving them the ability to generate their own examples .    with these motivations in mind , we developed a one - credit computational physics course along somewhat novel lines , first offered in the spring 2007 semester . in",
    "what follows , i review ( in sec .",
    "[ sec : description_course ] ) the structure of the course , then describe some of the homework - to - research related activities developed for the class ( in sec .  [",
    "sec : description_activities ] ) , and finally briefly outline some of the lessons learned and conclusions drawn from this experimental computational physics course .",
    "an appendix contains a brief lecture - by - lecture description of the course as well as some data on student satisfaction with each lecture topic .",
    "based on a variety of inputs ( student responses to an early survey of interest , faculty expertise in particular programming languages and experience in their use in both pedagogical and research level applications , as well as practical considerations such as the ready accessibility of hardware and software in a convenient computer lab setting ) the course was conceptualized as a one - credit `` _ introduction to mathematica in physics _ '' course .",
    "the strategies outlined in the course syllabus to help achieve the goals suggested by the students are best described as follows :    ( )    first use familiar problems from introductory physics and/or math courses to learn basic commands and programming methods .",
    "then use those techniques to probe harder physics problems at the junior - senior level , motivating the need for new skills and more extensive program writing to address junior - senior level physics problems not typically covered in standard courses .    finally , extend and expand the programming experience in order to obtain results comparable to some appearing in the research literature .",
    "this ` vertical ' structure was intentionally woven with cross - cutting themes involving comparisons of similar computational methods across topics , including numerical solutions of differential equations , matrix methods , special functions , connections between classical and quantum mechanical results , etc .. in that context , the emphasis was almost always on breadth over depth , reviewing a large number of both physics topics and programming commands / methods , rather than focusing on more detailed and extensive code writing .",
    "the visualization of both analytic and numerical results in a variety of ways was also consistently emphasized .",
    "ideas for some lecture topics came from the wide array of ` physics and ' books available , @xcite - @xcite , but others were generated from past experience with teaching junior - senior level courses on ` core ' topics , pedagogical papers involving the use of computational methods and projects ( from the pages of ajp and elsewhere ) , and especially from the research literature .    given my own interests in quantum mechanics and semi - classical methods , there was an emphasis on topics related to those areas .",
    "on the other hand , despite many excellent simulations in the areas of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics @xcite , because of my lack of experience in teaching advanced undergraduate courses on such topics , we covered only random walk processes in this general area . finally , the desire to make strong connections between research results and standardly seen topics in the undergraduate curriculum had a very strong affect on the choice of many components .",
    "weekly lectures ( generated with latex and printed into .pdf format ) were uploaded to a course web site , along with a number of ( uncompiled ) notebooks for each weeks presentation .",
    "links were provided to a variety of accompanying materials , including on - line resources , such as very useful mathworld ( ` http://mathworld.wolfram.com ` ) articles and carefully vetted _ wikipedia _",
    "( ` http://wikipedia.org/ ` ) entries , as well as .pdf copies of research papers , organized by lecture topic .",
    "the lecture notes were not designed to be exhaustive , as we often made use of original published papers as more detailed resources , motivating the common practice of working scientists to learn directly from the research literature . while there was no required text ( or one we even consulted regularly ) a variety of books ( including refs .",
    "@xcite - @xcite and others ) were put on reserve in the library .    while the lecture notes and notebooks were ( and still are ) publicly available , because of copyright issues related to the published research papers , the links to those components were necessarily password protected .",
    "( however , complete publication information is given for each link so other users can find copies from their own local college or university subscriptions . )",
    "the web pages for the course have been revised slightly since the end of the spring 2007 semester , but otherwise represent fairly well the state of the course at the end of the first offering .",
    "the site will be hereafter kept ` as - is ' to reflect its state at this stage of development and the url is ` www.phys.psu.edu/~rick/math/phys497.html ` .",
    "we have included at the site an extended version of this paper , providing more details about the course as well as personal observations about its development and outcomes .    a short list of topics covered ( by lecture ) is included in the appendix , and we will periodically refer to lectures below with the notation * l1 * , * l2 * , etc . in sec .",
    "[ sec : description_activities ] , but we will assume that readers with experience or interest in will download the notebooks and run them for more details .",
    "as an example of the philosophy behind the course structure , the first lecture at which serious commands were introduced and some simple code designed ( * l2 * ) , began with an extremely brief review ( via the on - line lecture notes ) of the standard e&m problem of the on - axis magnetic field of a helmholtz coil arrangement . this problem is discussed ( or at least assigned as a problem ) in many textbooks @xcite and requires only straightforward , if tedious , calculus ( evaluating up through a 4th derivative ) and algebra to find the optimal separation to ensure a highly uniform magnetic field at the center of two coils .",
    "a heavily commented sample program was used to ` solve ' this problem , which introduced students to many of the simplest constructs , such as defining and plotting functions , and some of the most obvious calculus and algebra commands , such as ` series [ ] ` , ` normal [ ] ` , ` coefficient [ ] ` , ` expand [ ] ` , and ` solve [ ] ` .",
    "( it helped to have a real pair of helmholtz coils where one could measure the separation with a ruler and compare to the radius ; lecture demonstrations , even for a computational physics course , are useful ! )    this simple exercise was then compared ( at a very cursory level ) to a much longer , more detailed notebook written by a former psu physics major ( now in graduate school ) as part of his senior thesis project dealing with designing an atom trap .",
    "links were provided to simple variations on this problem , namely the case of an anti - helmholtz coil , consisting of two parallel coils , with currents in opposite directions , designed to produce an extremely uniform magnetic field * gradient*. we were thus able to note that the initial investment involved in mastering the original program , could , by a very simple ` tweak ' of the notebook under discussion ( requiring only changes in a few lines of code ) solve a different , equally mathematically intensive problem almost for free .",
    "one of the very few examples of an explicit time - dependent solution of a quantum mechanical problem in the junior - senior level curriculum ( or standard textbooks at that level ) , in fact often the * only * such example , is the gaussian wavepacket solution of the 1d free - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "it is straightforward in to program readily available textbook solutions for this system and to visualize the resulting spreading wavepackets , allowing students to change initial conditions ( central position and momentum , initial spatial spread , etc . ) in order to study the dependence on such parameters .",
    "plotting the real and imaginary parts of the wavefunction , not just the modulus , also reminds students of the connection between the ` wiggliness ' of the @xmath0 solution and the position - momentum correlations that develop as the wave packet evolves in time @xcite .",
    "this exercise was done early in the course ( * l4 * ) when introducing visualizations and animations , but relied only on ` modern physics ' level quantum mechanics , though most students were already familiar with this example from their junior - level quantum mechanics course .",
    "students can easily imagine that such gaussian examples are only treated so extensively because they can be manipulated to obtain closed - form solutions , and often ignore the connection between that special form and its role as the ground - state solution of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "recent advances in atom trapping have shown that bose - einstein condensates can be formed where the time - development of the wavefunction of the particles , initially localized in the ground - state of a harmonic trap , can be modeled by the free - expansion of such gaussian solutions @xcite after the trapping potential is suddenly removed .",
    "students can then take ` textbook - level ' programs showing the spreading of @xmath1 gaussian solutions and profitably compare them with more rigorous theoretical calculations @xcite ( using the gross - pitaevskii model ) showing the expected coherent behavior of the real and imaginary parts of the time - dependent phase of the wave function of the condensate after the trapping potential is turned off .    while this comparison is itself visually interesting ,",
    "the experimental demonstration that the ` wiggles ' in the wavefunction are truly there comes most dramatically from the _ observation of interference between two bose condensates _",
    "@xcite and one can easily extend simple existing programs to include two expanding gaussians , and ` observe ' the resulting interference phenomena in a simulation , including the fact that the resulting fringe contrast in the overlap region is described by a time - dependent spatial period given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the initial spatial separation of the two condensates ; some resulting frames of the animation are shown in fig  [ fig : bec_pix ] . since the ( justly famous ) observations in ref .",
    "@xcite are destructive in nature , a simulation showing the entire development in time of the interference pattern is especially useful .",
    "the topic of wave phenomena in 1d and 2d systems , with and without boundary conditions , is one of general interest in the undergraduate curriculum , in both classical and quantum mechanical examples , and was the focus of * l5 * and * l6 * respectively .",
    "the numerical study of the convergence of fourier series solutions of a ` plucked string ' , for example , can extend more formal discussions in students math and physics coursework .",
    "more importantly , the time - dependence of solutions obtained in a formal way via fourier series can then also be easily visualized using the ability to ` animate [ ] ` in .    bridging the gap between classical and quantum mechanical wave propagation in 1d systems with boundaries ( plucked classical strings versus the 1d quantum well ) , time - dependent gaussian - like wave packet solutions for the 1d infinite square well can be generated by a simple generalization of the fourier expansion , with numerically accurate approximations available for the expansion coefficients @xcite to allow for rapid evaluation and plotting of the time - dependent waveform ( in either position- or momentum - space . ) animations over the shorter - term classical periodicity @xcite as well as the longer term quantum wave packet revival time scales @xcite , @xcite allow students to use this simplest of all quantum models to nicely illustrate many of the revival ( and fractional revival ) structures possible in bound state systems , a subject which is not frequently discussed in undergraduate textbooks at this level .",
    "examples of the early observations of these behaviors in rydberg atoms ( see , _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) are then easily appreciated in the context of a more realistic system with which students are well - acquainted , and are provided as links .",
    "students at the advanced undergraduate level will have studied the behavior of many differential equations in their math coursework ( sometimes poorly motivated ) , along with some standard , more physically relevant , examples from their core physics curriculum .",
    "less familiar mathematical systems , such the lotka - volterra ( predator - prey ) equations @xcite , which can be used to model the time - dependent variations in population models , are easily solved in mathematica using ` ndsolve [ ] ` , and these were one topic covered in * l9*. the resulting solutions can be compared against linearized ( small deviations from fixed population ) approximations for comparison with analytic methods , but are also nicely utilized to illustrate ` time - development flow ' methods for coupled first - order equations .",
    "for example , the lotka - volterra equations can be written in the form @xmath4 and one can use mathematica functions such as ` plotvectorfield [ ] ` to plot @xmath5 in the @xmath6 plane to illustrate the ` flow ' of the time - dependent @xmath7 solutions , themselves graphed using ` parametricplot [ ] ` . note that the lotka - volterra equations can also be integrated exactly to obtain implicit solutions , for which ` implicitplot [ ] ` can be used to visualize the results .",
    "these methods of analysis , while seen here in the context of two coupled first - order differential equations , are just as useful for more familiar single second - order equations of the form @xmath8 by writing @xmath9 to form a pair of coupled first - order equations , a common trick used when implementing tools such as the runge - kutta method . with this approach ,",
    "familiar problems such as the damped and undamped harmonic oscillator can also be solved and visualized by the same methods , very naturally generating phase space plots .",
    "more generally , such examples can be used to emphasize the importance of the mathematical description of nature in such life - science related areas as biophysics , population biology , and ecology .",
    "in fact , ` phase - space ' plots of the data from one of the early experimental tests of the lotka - volterra description of a simplified _ in vitro _",
    "biological system @xcite are a nice example of the general utility of such methods of mathematical physics .",
    "examples of coupled non - linear equations in a wide variety of physical systems can be studied in this way , _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite , to emphasize the usefulness of mathematical models , and computer solutions thereof , across scientific disciplines .",
    "other non - linear problems were studied in * l8 * and * l9 * using the ` ndsolve [ ] ` utility , including a non - linear pendulum .",
    "the motion of a charged particle in spatially- or temporally - dependent magnetic fields was also solved numerically , to be compared with closed - form solutions ( obtained using ` dsolve [ ] ` ) for the more familiar case of a uniform magnetic field , treated earlier in * l3*.      the study of the motion of a particle moving under the influence of an inverse square law is one of the staples of classical mechanics , and every undergraduate textbook on the subject treats some aspect of this problem , usually in the context of planetary motion and kepler s problem . in the context of popular textbooks",
    "@xcite , @xcite , the strategy is almost always to reduce the two - body problem to a single central - force problem , use the effective potential approach to solve for @xmath10 using standard integrals , and to then identify the resulting orbits with the familiar conic sections .",
    "solving such problems directly , using the numerical differential equation solving ability in , especially ` ndsolve [ ] ` , was the single topic of * l10*. for example , one can first easily check standard ` pencil - and - paper ' problems , such as the time to collide for two equal masses released from rest @xcite , @xcite as perhaps the simplest 1d example . given a program solving this problem , one can easily extend it to two - dimensions to solve for the orbits of two unequal mass objects for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "given the resulting numerically obtained @xmath11 and @xmath12 , one can then also plot the corresponding relative and center - of - mass coordinates to make contact with textbook discussions .",
    "effective one - particle problems can also be solved numerically to compare most directly with familiar derivations , but with monitoring of energy and angular momentum conservation made to test the numerical accuracy of the ` ndsolve [ ] ` utility ; one can then also confirm numerically that the components of the lenz - runge vector @xcite are conserved .    it is also straightforward to include the power - law exponent of the force law ( @xmath13 with @xmath14 for the coulomb / newton potential ) as a tunable parameter , and note that closed orbits are no longer seen when @xmath15 is changed from its inverse - square - law value , but are then recovered as one moves ( far away ) to the limit of the harmonic oscillator potential , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) , as discussed in many pedagogical papers pointing out the interesting connections between these two soluble problems @xcite .    with such programs in hand ,",
    "it is relatively easy to generalize 2-body problems to 3-body examples , allowing students to make contact with both simple analytic special cases and more modern research results on special classes of orbits , as in ref .",
    "the two most famous special cases of three equal mass particles with periodic orbits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : three_body ]  ( a ) and ( b ) ( and were discovered by euler and lagrange respectively ) .",
    "they are easily analyzed using standard freshman level mechanics methods , and just as easily visualized using simulations .",
    "an explicit example of one of the more surprising ` figure - eight ' type trajectories ( as shown in fig .  [ fig : three_body](c ) ) posited in ref .",
    "@xcite was discovered and discussed in detail in ref .",
    "it has been cited by christian , belloni , and brown @xcite as a nice example of an easily programmable result in classical mechanics , but arising from the very modern research literature of mathematical physics . in all three cases , it s straightforward to arrange the appropriate initial conditions to reproduce these special orbits , but also just as easy to drive them away from those values to generate more general complex trajectories , including chaotic ones .",
    "for example , the necessary initial conditions for the ` figure - eight ' orbit @xcite are given by @xmath19 the study of such so - called _ choreographed _ n - body periodic orbits has flourished in the literature of mathematical physics @xcite and a number of web sites illustrate some very beautiful , if esoteric , results @xcite .",
    "students expressed a keen interest in having more material about probability and statistical methods , so there was one lecture on the subject ( * l11 * ) which was commented upon very favorably in the end - of - semester reviews ( but not obviously any more popular in the numerical rankings ) dealing with simple 1d and 2d random walk simulations .",
    "this included such programming issues as being able to reproduce specific configurations using constructs such as the ` randomseed [ ] ` utility .",
    "such topics are then very close indeed to more research related methods such as the diffusion monte carlo approach to solving for the ground state of quantum systems @xcite , but also for more diverse applications of brownian motion problems in areas such as biophysics @xcite .",
    "the only topic relating to probability was a very short discussion of the ` birthday problem ' , motivated in part by the fact that the number of students in the course was always very close to the ` break even ' ( 50 - 50 probability ) number for having two birthdays in common !      the problem of the quantum bouncer , a particle of mass @xmath20 confined to a potential of the form @xmath21 is a staple of pedagogical articles @xcite where a variety of approximation techniques can be brought to bear to estimate the ground state energy ( variational methods ) , the large @xmath15 energy eigenvalues ( using wkb methods ) , and even quantum wave packet revivals @xcite .",
    "the problem can also be solved exactly , in terms of airy functions , for direct comparison to both approximation and numerical results . while this problem might well have been historically considered of only academic interest , experiments at the ill ( institute laue langevin ) @xcite , @xcite have provided evidence for the _ quantum states of neutrons in the earth s gravitational field _ where the bound state potential for the neutrons ( in the vertical direction at least ) is modeled by eqn .",
    "( [ bouncer_potential ] ) , using @xmath22 .    in the context of our course",
    ", students studied this system first in * l9 * in the context of the shooting method of finding well - behaved solutions of the 1d schrdinger equation , which then correspond to the corresponding quantized energy eigenvalues .",
    "the analogous ` half - oscillator ' problem , namely the standard harmonic oscillator , but with an infinite wall at the origin , can be used as a simple starting example for this method , motivating the boundary conditions ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 arbitrary ) imposed by the quantum bouncer problem .",
    "it can then be used as a testbed for the shooting method , seeing how well the exact energy eigenvalues , namely the values @xmath25 with @xmath15 odd , are reproduced .",
    "the change to dimensionless variables for the neutron - bouncer problem already provides insight into the natural length and energy scales of the system , allowing for an early comparison to the experimental values obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , the necessary dimensionful combinations of fundamental parameters ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) can be reduced ( in a sledge - hammer sort of way ) using the built - in numerical values of the physical constants available in ( loading ` < < miscellaneous\\`physicalconstants\\ `` ) which the students found amusing , although did not automatically recognize that ` joule = kilogram meter^2/second^2 ` . the numerically obtained energy eigenvalues ( obtained by bracketing solutions which diverge to @xmath29 ) can be readily obtained and compared to the ` exact ' values , but estimates of the accuracy and precision of the shooting method results are already available from earlier experience with the ` half - oscillator ' example .",
    "then , in the lecture on special functions ( * l12 * ) this problem is revisited using the exact airy function solutions , where one can then easily obtain the properly normalized wavefunctions for comparison with the results shown in fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite , along with quantities such as the expectation values and spreads in position , all obtained using the ` nintegrate [ ] ` command . once experience is gained with using the ` findroot [ ] ` option to acquire the airy zeros ( and corresponding energies ) , one can automate the entire process to evaluate all of the parameters for a large number of low - lying states using a ` do [ ] ` structure . obtaining physical values for such quantities as @xmath30 for the low - lying states was useful as their macroscopic magnitudes ( @xmath31 s of @xmath32 ) play an important role in the experimental identification of the quantum bound states .",
    "more generally , the study of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 solutions of the airy differential equation provided an opportunity to review general properties of second - order differential equations in 1d of relevance to quantum mechanics .",
    "topics discussed in this context included the behavior of the airy solutions for @xmath35 ( two linearly independent oscillatory functions , with amplitudes and ` wiggliness ' related to the potential ) and for @xmath36 ( exponentially growing and decaying solutions ) with comparisons to the far more familiar case arising from the study of a step potential .",
    "following up on * l6 * covering 2d wave physics , a section of * l12 * on special functions was devoted to bessel function solutions of the 2d wave equation for classical circular drumheads and for quantum circular infinite wells .",
    "many features of the short- and long - distance behavior of bessel functions can be understood in terms of their quantum mechanical analogs as free - particle solutions of the 2d schrdinger equation , and these aspects are emphasized in the first discussion of their derivation and properties in the lecture notes .",
    "such solutions can then be compared to now - famous results analyzing the _ confinement of electrons to quantum corrals on a metal surface _",
    "@xcite using just such a model of an infinite circular well .",
    "the vibrational modes of circular drumheads can , of course , also be analyzed in this context , and a rather focused discussion of the different classical oscillation frequencies obtained from the bessel function zeros was motivated , in part , by an obvious error in an otherwise very nice on - line simulation of such phenomena .",
    "the site ` http://www.kettering.edu/~drussell/demos/membranecircle/circle.html ` displays the nodal patterns for several of the lowest - lying vibrational modes , but the oscillations are synched up upon loading the web page , so that they all appear to have the same oscillation frequency ; hence an emphasis in this section on ` bug - checking ' against various limiting cases , the use of common sense in simulations , and the perils of visualization .",
    "the discussions of the energy eigenvalues ( normal mode frequencies ) for a variety of 2d infinite well geometries ( drumhead shapes ) generated earlier in the semester , allowed us to focus on using information encoded in the ` spectra ' arising from various shapes and its connection to classical and quantum results in * l13*. for example , the weyl area rule @xcite for the number of allowed @xmath37-states in the range @xmath38 for a 2d shape of area @xmath39 and perimeter @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 \\",

    "( [ weyl_prediction ] ) will be an approximation to a smoothed out version of the data. a relatively large number of ` exact ' solutions are possible for such 2d geometries , including the square , rectangle , @xmath47 triangle ( isosceles triangle obtained from a square cut along the diagonal @xcite , @xcite ) , equilateral ( @xmath48 ) triangle @xcite and variations thereof , as well as circular or half - circular wells , and many variations @xcite .",

    "has found a much deeper relationship between the quantum mechanical energy eigenvalue spectrum and the classical closed orbits of the same system @xcite , @xcite . given the spectra for the infinite well ` footprints ' mentioned above , it is easy to generate a minimal program @xcite to evaluate the necessary fourier transforms to visualize the contributions of the familiar ( and some not so familiar @xcite ) orbits in such geometries ; in fact , an efficient version of this type of analysis is used as an example of good programming techniques in ref .",
    "links to experimental results using periodic orbit theory methods in novel contexts @xcite are then possible .    these types of heavily numerical analyses , which either generate or make use of energy spectra , can lead to interesting projects based on pedagogical articles which reflect important research connections , such as in refs .  @xcite and @xcite .      in the original plan ,",
    "the last two lectures were to be reserved for examples related to chaos .",
    "we did indeed retain * l14 * for a focused discussion of chaotic behavior in a simple deterministic system , namely the logistic equation , using this oft - discussed calculational example , which requires only repeated applications of a simple iterative map of the form @xmath53 , as one of the most familiar examples , citing its connections to many physical processes @xcite .",
    "the intent was to then continue in * l15 * earlier studies of the ` real ' pendulum ( to now include driving forces ) to explore the wide variety of @xcite possible states , including chaotic behavior .",
    "based on student comments early in the semester , however , there was a desire among many of the students ( especially seniors ) to see examples of programs being used for ` real - time ' research amongst the large graduate student population in the department .",
    "one senior grad student , cristiano nisoli , who had just defended his thesis , kindly volunteered to give the last lecture , demonstrating in detail some of his notebooks and explaining how the results they generated found their way into many of his published papers @xcite .",
    "examples included generating simple graphics ( since we made only occasional use of ` graphics [ ] ` elements and absolutely no use of palette symbols ) to much more sophisticated dynamical simulations ( some using genetic algorithm techniques ) requiring days of running time . while some of the physics results were obviously",
    "far beyond the students experience , a large number of examples of command structures and code - writing methods were clearly recognizable from programs we d covered earlier in the semester , including such ` best - practice ' checks as monitoring ( numerically ) the total energy of a system , in this case , in various verlet algorithms .",
    "some of the notebooks and published papers he discussed are linked at the course web site .",
    "evaluation and assessment can be one of the most challenging aspects of any educational enterprise , and many scientists may not be well trained to generate truly meaningful appraisals of their own pedagogical experiments . in the case of this course , where the goals were less specific and fixed than in a standard junior - senior level course in a traditional subject area , that might be especially true .",
    "since the course was not designed to cover one specific set of topics , the use of well - known instruments for assessment such as the fci and others @xcite for concepts related to topics more often treated at the introductory level , or specialized ones @xcite covering more advanced topics , did not seem directly relevant .",
    "weekly graded homework assignments were used to evaluate the students , but during the entire development and delivery of the course , there were also attempts at repeatedly obtaining student feedback , at regular intervals . some of the results can be shared here , but we stress that they are only of the ` student satisfaction ' type .",
    "we note that in the spring 2007 semester , there were a total of 23 students enrolled in this trial offering , 12 juniors and 11 seniors , 4 female and 19 male , 21 physics majors and 2 majors in astronomy / astrophysics .",
    "students in almost every course at penn state are asked to provide anonymous student ratings of teaching effectiveness each semester .",
    "four questions are common to every form , including _ rate the overall quality of the course _ and _ rate the overall quality of the instructor _ , all on a scale from 1 - 7 . for the initial offering of this course ,",
    "the results for those two questions ( obtained after the semester was over and grades were finalized and posted ) were found to be 6.05/7.00 and 6.89/7.00 respectively .",
    "additional ` in - house ' departmental evaluation forms were used to solicit students comments , and were also only returned after the semester was completed .",
    "these forms are very open - ended and only include instructions such as _ in the spaces below , please comment separately about the and about the _ .",
    "all of the resulting comments were positive , and consistent with similar feedback obtained from the ` for - credit ' surveys .",
    "while such results are certainly encouraging , recall that the students registered for the course were highly self - selected and all rightly answered in the same surveys that this course was a true elective and not required in our major .",
    "one of the very few explicit goals was to try to encourage students to make use of in their other coursework , and a question related to just such outcomes was posed in a final survey .",
    "the vast majority of students replied that they had used it somewhat or even extensively in their other courses that semester .",
    "for juniors , the examples were quantum mechanics ( doing integrals , plotting functions ) , the complex analysis math course ( doing integrals to compare to results obtained by contour integration ) and to some extent in the statistical mechanics course . for seniors ,",
    "the typical uses were in their physics elective courses ( especially the math intensive special and general relativity elective ) , a senior electronics course ( where the professor has long made use of ` canned ' programs ) and senior level mathematics electives being taken to fulfill the requirements of a minor or second major . at least one",
    "student used techniques to complete an honors option in a course he was taking , but the majority seemed to use in either ` graphing calculator ' or ` math handbook ' modes , and not for further extensive programming .",
    "finally , while i used as the programming tool , set in a linux classroom , for the development and delivery of this course , these choices were only because of my personal experience with the software and the readily available access to the hardware , as i have no very strong sectarian feelings about either component .",
    "i think that many physics faculty with facility in languages such as maple or matlab , access to a computer lab / classroom facility , and personal interests in modern research in a wide variety of areas can rather straightforwardly generate a similar course .",
    "i only suggest that the approach , namely using introductory physics and math problems to motivate the use of an integrated programming language , which can then be used to bridge the gap between more advanced coursework and research results , can be a fruitful one .    *",
