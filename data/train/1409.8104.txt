    "wireless energy transfer ( wet ) using radio frequency ( rf ) signals is a promising technology to provide perpetual power supplies for sensors , radio - frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , and other devices with very low power consumption and which are difficult to access @xcite . in particular",
    ", rf - enabled wet enjoys many practical advantages , such as wide coverage , low production cost , small receiver form factor , and efficient energy multicasting thanks to the broadcast nature of electromagnetic waves .",
    "of course , rf signals have also been widely used as a means for transmitting information . to enable",
    "a dual use of rf signals , simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) has become a fast - emerging area of research @xcite , where hybrid access points ( aps ) are deployed to simultaneously deliver both energy and information to one or more receivers via rf signals .",
    "the idea of swipt was first proposed by varshney @xcite , in which a point - to - point single - antenna additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel for swipt was investigated from an information - theoretic standpoint .",
    "this work was then extended to frequency - selective awgn channels in @xcite , where a non - trivial tradeoff between information rate and harvested energy was shown by varying power allocation over frequency .",
    "prior works @xcite have studied the fundamental performance limits of wireless systems with swipt , where the receiver is ideally assumed to be able to decode the information and harvest the energy independently from the same received signal . however",
    ", this assumption implies that the received signal used for harvesting energy can be reused for decoding information without any loss , which is not realizable yet due to practical circuit limitations .",
    "consequently , in @xcite , various practical receiver architectures for swipt were proposed , such as time - switching and power - splitting .",
    "the authors in @xcite studied swipt for fading awgn channels subject to time - varying co - channel interference , and proposed a new principle termed `` opportunistic energy harvesting '' where the receiver switches between harvesting energy and decoding information based on the wireless channel condition and interference power level .",
    "the practical implementation of swipt is limited by the severe path loss and fading of wireless channels , and multi - antenna processing is an appealing solution to improve the efficiency of both information and energy transfer .",
    "recently , there have been a handful of papers on studying the multi - antenna swipt systems under various setups including broadcast channel ( bc ) @xcite , multicast system @xcite , interference channel @xcite , and relay channel @xcite . as for the multi - antenna bc",
    ", the authors in @xcite first characterized the rate - energy ( r - e ) tradeoff for a simplified multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) bc with two ( either separated or co - located ) receivers implementing information decoding ( i d ) and energy harvesting ( eh ) , respectively .",
    "the study in @xcite was then extended to the case with imperfect channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite studied the multiple - input single - output ( miso ) bc for swipt with multiple separated and co - located i d and eh receivers , respectively . in @xcite , physical layer security is considered under miso bc for swipt by adding additional secrecy information transmission constraint , which reveal interesting new insights that the energy - carrying signal can also play the role of artificial noise ( an ) to ensure secrecy in information transmission . however , all these prior works on multi - antenna bc consider low - complexity linear precoding / beamforming for swipt , which is in general suboptimal .",
    "therefore , the fundamental limits on the information and energy transfer in general multi - antenna bc for swipt remain unknown , thus motivating this work .",
    "this paper studies a miso - bc for swipt , where a multi - antenna ap delivers both wireless information and energy to multiple receivers each with a single antenna .",
    "each receiver implements either i d or eh alone dbm or more for real - time operation , while i d receivers such as cellular and wifi mobile receivers often operate with a received power less than @xmath0 dbm @xcite ) , and thus the existing rf front - end for wireless eh can not currently be used for i d and vice versa . ] .",
    "pseudo - random sequences that are _ a priori _ known and therefore can be cancelled at each i d receiver are used as the energy signals , and the information - theoretically optimal dirty paper coding ( dpc ) @xcite is employed for the information transmission . under this setup",
    ", we characterize the fundamental limits on the information and energy transfer of the considered miso - bc for swipt , by establishing the capacity region for the i d receivers while ensuring given minimum energy requirements for eh receivers .",
    "specifically , the capacity region is characterized by solving a sequence of weighted sum - rate ( wsr ) maximization ( wsrmax ) problems for all i d receivers subject to a maximum transmit sum - power constraint for the ap , and a set of minimum harvested power constraints for individual eh receivers .",
    "interestingly , these problems belong to a new form of wsrmax problem for miso - bc with combined maximum and minimum linear transmit covariance constraints ( maxltccs and minltccs ) , which is non - convex in general and thus difficult to be solved optimally by standard convex optimization techniques .",
    "it should be noted that the wsrmax problem with only maxltccs has been investigated in @xcite to establish the capacity region of multi - antenna bc , in which a general bc - multiple access channel ( mac ) duality is applied to solve this problem optimally .",
    "however , the wsrmax problem in our case is different and more challenging due to the newly introduced minltccs that arise from the minimum harvested power constraints for the eh receivers . as a result",
    ", the general bc - mac duality does not directly apply here . to overcome this challenge",
    ", we propose an efficient algorithm to optimally solve the new wsrmax problem with combined maxltccs and minltccs , by extending the general bc - mac duality and applying the ellipsoid method .",
    "one more side effect of the minltccs is that although the solution generated by the ellipsoid method achieves the optimal wsr , it may not be feasible to the primal problem .",
    "this is because the equivalent noise covariance matrix of the dual mac may not be of full rank , which implies an infinite number of possible solutions for the dual mac . in this case , a semi - definite program ( sdp ) needs to be further solved to obtain a primal feasible solution . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our approach is novel and has not been studied in the literature .",
    "it is shown that at the optimal solution , the energy signals should be in the null space of all i d receivers channels ( if it is not an empty set ) . furthermore , to reduce the implementation complexity of the optimal solution ( especially the iterative search with the ellipsoid method ) , we propose two suboptimal algorithms by separately designing the information and energy signals . finally , numerical results are provided to validate our proposed algorithms .",

    "it is assumed that all i d and eh receivers are each equipped with one receive antenna , whereas the ap is equipped with @xmath25 transmit antennas .",
