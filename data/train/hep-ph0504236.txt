    "an important question in particle physics is the nature of new physics beyond the astoundingly successful standard model .",
    "one compelling scenario for this new physics is the weak scale supersymmetry which provides an answer to a number of puzzles of the standard model such as a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem , the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking as well as providing a candidate for dark matter of the universe .",
    "an added virtue is that it unifies the disparate strengths of the weak , electromagnetic and strong forces at a scale of about @xmath1 gev , opening up another rich landscape of new physics around this scale .",
    "this high scale new physics can only manifest itself at low energies via large radiative correction effects which depend logarithmically on mass as well as through effects such as proton decay which are suppressed by this new high scale .",
    "there is reason to believe that there might be a manifestation of this new physics effect in the domain of neutrinos .",
    "this arises from the consideration of seesaw mechanism@xcite which provides a very natural way to understand the extreme smallness of neutrino masses and which requires the existence of massive right handed neutrinos with at least one having mass close to the gut scale .",
    "it is therefore suggestive that both the seesaw scale and the gut scale are one and the same .",
    "this connection becomes particularly plausible in the context of models based on the grand unifying groups such as so(10)@xcite or @xmath2@xcite that predict the existence of the right handed neutrino as part of the common fermion multiplet along with the fermions of the standard model .    in a recent paper",
    ", this concept of unification of gut scale and seesaw scale was taken one step further by making the plausible hypothesis that quark and lepton mixings angles may be same at the seesaw scale due to quark lepton unification whereas the observed large mixings at the weak scale are a consequence of radiative corrections . using the formulae for renormalization group evolution for neutrino mass@xcite , it was shown that this possibility can be realized if the neutrino masses are quasi - degenerate and have same cp@xcite .",
    "models based on @xmath3 group were presented where both the quasidegeneracy as well as mixing unification at the seesaw scale arose from the so - called type ii seesaw formula@xcite .",
    "detailed renormalization group evolution of mixing angles then revealed that one indeed gets the desired bilarge mixing pattern at low energies which are in agreement with the solar and the atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "the third angle also undergoes radiative magnification , but remains small and well within the chooz - palo - verde limit@xcite due to the smallness of the corresponding initial value which is the quark mixing , @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , our hypothesis has the interesting prediction that the common value for the quasi - degenerate neutrino mass is larger than 0.2 ev , which can be tested in the next round of the neutrinoless double beta decay experiments@xcite and is in the range claimed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it also overlaps with the range accessible to the katrin experiment@xcite and consistent with the bound obtained from wmap@xcite .",
    "threshold corrections at the low - energy susy scale have been found to improve agreement@xcite with the most recent data including kamland and sno@xcite for a particular choice of the susy particle spectrum .",
    "as mentioned , two important ingredients that allow the radiative magnification to work are low - energy supersymmetry(susy ) and large values of @xmath5 which contribute large logarithmic factors for radiative magnification via amplified values of @xmath6-yukawa coupling .",
    "recently , a new unification scenario has been advocated@xcite which is based on the observation that one can maintain gauge - coupling unification and neutralino dark matter without necessarily `` buying '' the entire machinary of weak scale supersymmetry but rather keeping only a subset of susy particles i.e. the gauginos and the higgsino at the weak scale and pushing the rest of the superpartners to high intermediate scales(@xmath7 ) .",
    "this has been called split supersummetry .",
    "this approach discards the naturalness requirement for the higgs mass that motivated the weak scale supersymmetry- thus one has to fine tune the higgs mass to every loop order .",
    "one also has no simple mechanism to understand the electroweak symmetry breaking . despite these disadvantages",
    ", one might consider this as an interesting minimal extension of the standard model that preserves gauge - coupling unification and provides a neutralino dark matter and discuss how neutrinos fit into it .",
    "clearly , there is no inherent obstacle to implementing the seesaw mechanism and quark - lepton unification in these models .",
    "only thing one has to keep in mind is that since the seesaw physics and quark - lepton unification generally tend to add new contributions to the gauge coupling evolution , if we want to retain the simple unification of three standard model gauge couplings , the seesaw scale must be at or above the gut scale . in this paper , we work within a framework of this type and see if we can understand the large neutrino mixings via the radiative magnification mechanism .    below the high susy scale(@xmath7 ) in split supersymmetry , apart from the presence of gauginos and higgsinos , the effective theory is governed by nonsusy standard model with one light higgs doublet . as the two important ingredients in the radiative magnification scenario i.e. the long intervals of running in the presence of weak scale susy and the enhancement factor due to @xmath5 are missing in the split supersymmetry below @xmath8 , a natural apprehension emerges about the validity of this mechanism@xcite for large neutrino mixings .",
    "working within a model with quark - lepton unification based on the group @xmath9 and degenerate masses for neutrinos obtained via the type ii seesaw mechanism@xcite and the usual split susy spectrum , we show that this model does indeed lead to bilarge mixing pattern at low energies .",
    "the @xmath10 symmetry guarantees mixing unification between the quark and the lepton sectors at the seesaw scale ( i.e. @xmath11 ) .",
    "the new point which is different from the work of ref.@xcite is that running of neutrino masses is now different .",
    "furthermore , in order to maintain gauge coupling unification , we must have the seesaw scale equal to the gut scale , as already noted .",
    "we carry out this running effect and show that despite the high split susy scale , the radiative magnification mechanism operates successfully to give the bilarge mixings at the weak scale provided that , in addition to the quasi - degenerate majorana neutrino masses with same cp , we have the scalar susy partners with masses starting at least 2 - 3 orders below the seesaw scale . whereas with low - energy susy , the radiative magnification occurs at @xmath12 tev , in split supersymmetry it occurs at the high value of the susy scale which may be any where between @xmath13 gev-@xmath14 gev . below this scale",
    ", the rge running does not affect the neutrino mixings significantly .",
    "what is interesting is that radiative magnification occurs for the scalar susy partner masses close to even the scale @xmath14 gev so that a major part of the running is nonsupersymmetric .",
    "including small threshold effects needed to fit the details like the solar mass - squared difference , the extrapolated low enery values of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the mixing angles are in excellent agreement with the current solar , atmospheric , and the reactor neutrino data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we discuss the relevant rges in the context of split supersymmetry . in sec .",
    "3 , we present allowed perturbative region of @xmath5 , radiative magnification of mixing angles at high susy scales and low energy extrapolation of masses and mixings . in sec . 4",
    ", we discuss threshold effects and their estimations .",
    "discussion of the results and conclusions are presented in sec.5 .",
    "in this section while discussing renormalization group equations(rges ) for neutrino masses and mixings we point out some special features of split supersymmetry that contribute to radiative magnification of the mixings at high susy scales . since we will follow the bottom - up approach to determine initial conditions at the seesaw scales for rg - evolutions of neutrino parameters in the top - down approach , we use the stadard rges for the susy , split supersymmetry , and nonsusy cases as applicable in appropriate domains@xcite . in the context of split supersymmetry where the scale(@xmath8 ) of the scalar superpartner masses could be much larger than the weak scale@xcite , the seesaw scale(@xmath17 ) is clearly always larger than the susy scale(@xmath8 ) i , e @xmath18 .",
    "we assume the neutrino mass eigenstates to be quasi - degenerate and possess the same cp .",

    "this causes @xmath29 large , and hence large magnification to the mixing angle due to radiative effects through eqs.(3)-(5 ) .",
    "another major factor contributing to radiative magnification is due to amplified negative value of @xmath30 in eqs.(3)-(5 ) in the presence of susy by a factor @xmath31 in the large @xmath5 region .    an approximate estimation of values of @xmath5 needed for radative magnification in split susy is possible by noting that the magnification has been realized in mssm with weak - scale susy for @xmath32 and in that case the major factor controlling magnification is due to amplification of @xmath6-yukawa coupling@xcite .",
    "expecting similar amplification in split susy gives the appoximate relation ,    ^2 ( m^0_r / m^0_s)&= & ( h_)^2 ( m_r / m_s ) .",
    "[ eq10 ]    where quantities with zero superscript(without superscript ) refer to weak - scale(split ) supersymmetry .",
    "noting that the ratio of the two @xmath6-yukawa coplings in eq.(10 ) is @xmath33 , and using @xmath34@xcite , and @xmath35 gev , the above relation gives the approximate requirements for split supersymmetry case as @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 gev , and @xmath39 gev , respectively .",
    "in fact , it has been noted that split susy permits larger values of @xmath5 than the mssm with weak scale susy@xcite .    it would be shown in sec.3 that the allowed perturbative upper limit of @xmath5 increases with increase of the susy scale .",
    "thus even though the supersymmetric part of the running of neutrino parameters is much less than in the weak scale supersymmetry case , larger values of tan beta increases the value of @xmath30 and this in turn leads to the desired enhancement of the radiative magnification effect on the mixing angles .",
    "in addition to the above , here we point out that there is a specific mechanism which operates in the allowed parameter space of split susy that causes mass eigenvalues to approach one another faster and thus , drives radiative magnification even if the susy scale is many orders larger than the weak scale . noting that the @xmath40-function coefficient for the evolution of mass eigenvalue @xmath41 in eq.(2 ) is @xmath42= @xmath43 , near the seesaw scale @xmath44 , for @xmath45 because of high - scale mixing unification constraint , but @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the third mass eigen value would be different from the first two .",
    "further , since supersymmetric @xmath47 is negative for @xmath48 and , depending upon the allowed values of the gauge and the yukawa coupling constants contributing to @xmath49 in eq.(6 ) above the high susy scale , the @xmath40-function coefficient may be positive or negative thus resulting in the decreasing or increasing behavior of the mass - eigen value below the seesaw scale down to @xmath7 .",
    "in particular with split supersymmetry @xmath50 may be positive due to dominance of gauge couplings over the top - yukawa coupling resulting in negative values of @xmath51 for @xmath48 .",
    "but since @xmath30 is negative , the positive value of the first term , @xmath52 , may partly or largely cancel with the second term leading to a large or small positive value of @xmath53 . as a result",
    ", the first two mass eigen values may be expected to increase but the  third may decrease , rapidly or slowly , from their input values at @xmath54 .",
    "this increasing behavior of some mass eigen values(@xmath55 ) in the region @xmath56 would be in sharp contrast to that in mssm with weak - scale susy where the allowed high scale values of the gauge and the yukawa couplings and the mixing unification constraint have been found to make all the three @xmath40-function coefficients positive resulting in the decrasing behavior of the three mass eigen values below the seesaw scale although with different rates@xcite .",
    "thus , with split susy the allowed values of the parameter space may cause three mass eigen values to approach sufficiently closer to one another even after much shorter interval of running .",
    "this may occur at high values of @xmath7 which may even be only @xmath57 orders smaller than @xmath54 .",
    "then the functions @xmath29 large near @xmath7 causing magnification of the mixing angles .    on the otherhand for @xmath58 ,",
    "the @xmath6-yukawa coupling has negligible contribution and the @xmath40-function coefficients are nearly the same for all the three eigen values and approximately equal to @xmath59 . from eq.(7 ) is clear that in the presence of nonsusy sm , @xmath49 is negative below @xmath7 resulting in positive beta - function coefficients for all mass - eigen values causing them to decrease approximately in the same manner  down to @xmath60 .",
    "it is easy to check , using boundary conditions given in eqs.(8)-(9 ) , that @xmath49 is negative at the starting point @xmath7 of the nonsusy theory , with @xmath61 .",
    "although this feature is also common to mssm with the weak - scale susy , in split susy the running interval for nonsupersymmetric theory is much larger .",
    "our numerical solutions to masses and mixing angles reported in sec.3 with split susy are found to corroborate these properties of the rg - evolution .",
    "in this section we discuss the realization of radiative magnification of neutrino mixing angles at high susy scales and low energy extrapolations of mass eigen values and mixing angles for comparison with the available experimental data .",
    "perturbative limit on @xmath5 * + the fact that grand unification with split supersymmetry allows larger values of @xmath5 than those with weak - scale susy has been also noted in ref.@xcite . since the value of @xmath5 is an important ingredient , at first we estimate the maximum allowed values of @xmath5 for every value of @xmath7=@xmath62 gev - @xmath14 gev . for this purpose",
    "we use the standard pdg values of masses and couplings@xcite at @xmath63 and follow the bottom - up approach scanning the values of the three gauge couplings and the third generation yukawa couplings while varying input values of @xmath5 over a wide range at all values of @xmath64 up to the gut - scale using the rges in the appropriate regions@xcite .",
    "the lowest allowed value of @xmath5 is determined when the top - quark yukawa coupling reaches the perturbative limit(@xmath65 ) .",
    "similarly the upper limit is determined by noting that the @xmath6-lepton yukawa coupling attains its perturbative limit at the gut - scale .",
    "these are shown in fig.1 .",

    "these input parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "the unknown parameters @xmath75 are determined in such a way that the magnified values of mixing angles are at first obtained at @xmath7 along with the mass eigen - values . these are further extrapolated down to @xmath63 through the corresponding rges to give closest agreement with the experimental data :    & = & ( 5 - 8)10 ^ -5ev^2 ,  = ( 1.2 - 3)10 ^ -3ev^2 , + _ 23&=&0.67 - 0.707 ,   _ 12= 0.5 - 0.6 ,  _",
    "130.16  .[eq11 ]    as noted in sec.2 the signs and values of the three @xmath40-functions for the mass eigen values at the respective seesaw scales are easily checked from the initial values of couplings given in table 1 using eq.(2 ) .",
    "for example for the case with @xmath76 gev , @xmath38 gev , @xmath77 , the values of coupling constants given in table.1 yield the @xmath40-function coefficients at @xmath17 to be @xmath78 , @xmath79 which , as per the predictions of sec.2 , are responsible for the slow decrease of @xmath80 and rather faster increase of @xmath81 and @xmath82 below the seesaw scale .",
    "these features are clearly displayed in fig.2 .",
    "similarly for @xmath76 gev , @xmath83 gev , @xmath77 , these coefficients are @xmath84 , @xmath85 at the gut - seesaw scale .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that the mutual differences are narrowed down by the increase of the first and the second mass eigenvalues and simultaneous decrease of the third eigen value leading to large @xmath86 and the magnification at @xmath7 .",
    "this may be contrasted with the low - energy susy case where all the three masses showed decreasing behavior although with different rates@xcite .",
    "this increasing behavior of neutrino masses @xmath87 in contrast to the decrasing behavior in low - energy susy is due to different relative values of the gauge and yukawa couplings at higher scales in the large @xmath5-region in split susy some of which are given in table.1 .",
    "below @xmath7 the decrease is almost uniform due to approximate equality of the corresponding @xmath40-function  coefficients of the three mass eigenvalues in this region as discussed in sec.2 .",
    "the solutions shown in the fig.4 and fig.5 clearly exhibit radiative magnification to bilarge mixings at the high values of @xmath7=@xmath88 gev , and @xmath7=@xmath39 gev corresponding to the evolutions of mass eigen values as shown in fig.2 , and fig.3 , respectively . +     + for the seesaw scale at @xmath89 gev the magnification of mixings takes place even at such high susy - scale as @xmath90 gev .",
    "it is clear that due to larger allowed values of @xmath5 and also due to opposite signs of @xmath40-function coefficients of mass eigen values at high scales , the radiative magnification of neutrino mixings is possible in split susy at high susy scales even if the susy - scale is onle @xmath57 orders smaller than the seesaw scale .",
    "we find that although enhancement due to rg evolution occurs in the @xmath91 sector also , the predicted low energy value remains at @xmath92 which is well within the chooz - palo verde bound@xcite and can be tested in the planned @xmath93 search experiments .",
    "in the previous section we considered the mass squared differences obtained at lower energies purely by rg - evolution and these , as  shown in table 1 , are in agreement with gross features of the experimental data on atmospheric neutrinos but falls somewhat on the higher side of solar neutrino data . since threshold effects have been shown to make significant contribution on quasidegenerate neutrinos@xcite in this section we estimate them to spplement our rg - solutions of sec.3 .",
    "in particular we note that the loop facotr at the high - susy - scale threshold(@xmath94 ) , where the heavy superpartners are located , assumes a very simple form .",
    "the threshold loop factor for neutrino mass at the electroweak scale is similar to the sm@xcite    in contrast to the weak - scale susy where the superpartners contribute predominantly near @xmath60@xcite , in split susy the dominant threshold corrections to neutrino masses occur near high susy - scale threshold @xmath95 .",
    "since the mixing angles in the radiative magnification scenario are very nearly the same at both the thresholds , it is quite convenient to use the approximation for the pmns matix @xmath96 and evaluate them in the limit @xmath97 and @xmath98 which are very closely cosistent with our solutions@xcite .    using the loop factors @xmath99 in the mass basis with ( @xmath100 ) the threshold effects on mass eigen values at the threshold @xmath101",

    "such threshold contributions , when added to the rg - effects , bring the theoretical predictions in concordance with all the available neutrino data including those from kamland and sno .",
    "in this section we discuss the implications of our results briefly and state our conclusions .",

    "this is accessible to all the experiments being planned to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay .",

    "<S> radiative corrections to neutrino mixings in seesaw models depend on the nature of new physics between the weak and the gut - seesaw scales and can be taken into account using the renormalization group equations . </S>",
    "<S> this new physics effect becomes particularly important for models with quasi - degenerate neutrino masses where small neutrino mixings at the seesaw scale can get magnified by radiative renormalization effects alone to match observations . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism of radiative magnification which provides a simple understanding of why lepton mixings are so different from quark mixings was demonstrated by us for the standard supersymmetry scenario where the particle spectrum becomes supersymmetric above the weak scale . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we examine this phenomenon in split supersymmetry scenarios and find that the mechanism works also for this scenario provided the susy scale is at least 2 - 3 orders below the gut - seesaw scale and one has larger values of @xmath0 . </S>"
