    "in the previous paper @xcite we presented a phase - field model for the saffman  taylor problem with arbitrary viscosity contrast .",
    "the problem consists in determining the time evolution of the interface between two inmiscible ( viscous ) fluids within a hele ",
    "shaw cell @xcite .",
    "this can be done analytically only in very restricted situations , so numerical work is usually required .",
    "as other free boundary problems ( bulk problems with boundary conditions on a moving boundary ) , hele  shaw flows have traditionally been formulated by projecting the bulk dynamics onto the interface using boundary - integral methods which lead to integro - differential equations @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach , namely the so - called phase - field model , has also been used to study solidification and related problems @xcite .",
    "this approach describes the system in terms of a set of partial differential equations avoiding the treatment of the interface as a moving boundary . to do so ,",
    "an additional field is introduced which locates the interface at a region of thickness @xmath0 .",
    "the equations are then required to yield the original moving - boundary problem in the sharp interface limit @xmath1 . for hele ",
    "shaw flows , such a phase - field model was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "two independent small parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) were actually introduced , over which three distinct conditions control the convergence to the sharp - interface limit @xmath3 . in the paper we proved that model to yield the right sharp - interface equations in this limit and obtained a ` thin - interface ' model , which consists of a set of effective sharp - interface equations which keep finite-@xmath0 and -@xmath2 effects up to first order .",
    "this provides appropriate criteria to choose the computational parameters for numerical simulations , and , for the linear regime , it enables to explicitly compute deviations from the hele  shaw growth rates .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to numerically check the phase - field model , and eventually the corresponding thin - interface approximation , against known sharp - interface solutions , and to asses his usefulness in practice .",
    "indeed , the fact that the model has the correct sharp - interface limit does not guarantee its practical usefulness for several reasons . on the one hand , the stability of both the bulk phases and the kink profile must be assured , since this might not be the case in general . on the other hand ,",
    "a direct empirical test is necessary to determine quantitatively how close a finite @xmath0 situation is to the sharp - interface limit .",
    "this means finding a set of explicit quantitative criteria to choose all the nonphysical parameters in order to ensure a desired accuracy . finally , it is interesting to evaluate the capability of that model at providing quantitative results with reasonable computing efforts in actual simulations .",

    "we will consider a rectangular hele ",
    "shaw cell of width @xmath4 ( @xmath5-direction ) and gap @xmath6 ( @xmath7-direction ) , containing two fluids with distinct viscosities ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and densities ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "both fluids are separated by an interface with surface tension @xmath12 , and move under an effective gravity @xmath13 ( negative @xmath14-direction ) and an injection velocity @xmath15 ( positive @xmath14-direction ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the stream function @xmath16 as the harmonic conjugate , which can be defined by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the @xmath21 components of the fluid velocity field @xmath22 . in terms of the stream function",

    ". we will restrict ourselves to the unstable case , i.e. positive values of @xmath35 .",
    "the equations are then written in the frame moving with the fluid at infinity ( or , equivalently , with the mean interface ) , and taking @xmath4 as the length unit and @xmath36 the velocity unit ( see @xcite ) .    the corresponding phase - field model which we have used was proposed in @xcite , with @xmath37 the phase field :    @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , together with the boundary condition    @xmath45    where @xmath46 corresponds to fluid 1 ( 2 ) .",
    "@xmath2 can be regarded as a diffusion time of the stream function over a characteristic length of wavenumber @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( which must be chosen much smaller than the characteristic inverse growth rate of the corresponding mode of the interface @xmath49 ) . on the other hand @xmath0",
    "is basically the interface thickness ( which is required to be much smaller than the length scale @xmath50 ) .",
    "@xmath51 also stands for the relaxation time of the phase field towards the kink profile , which in turn must be kept well below the inverse growth rate @xmath49 ( see ref . @xcite .",
    "iv ) . these inequalities control the convergence to the hele ",
    "shaw dynamics , and , for the linear regime , the deviation from it can be computed analytically from them ( see ref .",
    "iv ) , thus providing _ a priori _ criteria for the choice of @xmath2 and @xmath0 to obtain a prescribed accuracy .",
    "to be consistent with the frame change and adimensionalization inherent to the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath33 previously defined we use a cell of width 1 , with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath5-direction ( which include rigid walls as a particular case ) and no flux ( constant stream function , e.g. @xmath52 ) in the @xmath14-direction . whenever some symmetry of an initial condition exists and is preserved by the time evolution ,",
    "we use a properly reduced integration domain ( e.g. left - right symmetry for a single mode , or up - down symmetry for an up - down symmetric initial condition with @xmath53 ) . numerical integration of the above equations has been carried out on a grid of size @xmath54 with equal spacing @xmath55 in both x and y directions , using an explicit centered - space algorithm .",
    "@xmath56 is choosen so that @xmath57 at most equals @xmath58 for the profile of the fields across the interface to be properly resolved .",
    "the @xmath58 value thus constrains @xmath57 and , in turn , the minimum size of the system and the maximum time step , so that the computing time required to integrate a certain physical dynamics goes as @xmath59 .",
    "then @xmath60 is chosen so that there is always a distance of at least one of the largest present wavelengths between the interface and the @xmath52 boundary condition at the end of the channel .",
    "an increase in this distance does not seem to affect appreciably the interface evolution .",
    "this is what expected in the linear regime , where the stream function decays exponentially with the present wavelengths , but is an _ a posteriori _ observation for the saffman  taylor fingers .    as for the initial condition , in general one should set the phase field to @xmath61 , with @xmath26 being the signed distance to the desired interface , which is the model solution at least up to first order in @xmath0 ( see ref .",
    "then the corresponding stream function should be close to the stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sf ] ) for that phase field .",
    "this can be obtained either by solving the stationary version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sf ] ) ( a poisson equation ) or by letting the stream function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sf ] ) relax while keeping the phase field frozen .",
    "however in the present paper , since we will consider perturbed planar interfaces as initial situations , we will make use of the fields predicted by the linear theory : @xmath62 , where @xmath14 is signed vertical distance to the desired interface , and the thin - interface result ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "before testing the model in physical situations a preliminary test is that of the conservation of the two fluid phases . due to incompressibility and immiscibility , the hele ",
    "shaw dynamics preserve the area and phase purity of each domain .",
    "in contrast , model a , starting point for the equation for the phase - field eq . ( [ eq : pf ] ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , does not even preserve the global balance between phases . for reasonable values of the interface thickness",
    "@xmath0 these non - conserved dynamics are given aproximately by allen ",
    "cahn law ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "thus , phase - conservation within the phase - field scheme depends on the accuracy of both the @xmath67 term in cancelling out allen  cahn law and the coupling @xmath68 in introducing the hele",
    " shaw dynamics .",
    "first , we test allen  cahn law cancellation by considering situations in which the stream function drops from the equations . for a circular droplet of one phase embedded in the other in absence of gravity",
    "( [ eq : pf ] ) reduces to @xmath69 ( because @xmath70 ) , where @xmath26 is the radial coordinate .",
    "this is exactly model a in one dimension , and therefore allen  cahn law can not arise . starting with @xmath61 as initial condition",
    ", there is some slow dynamics which soon gets stacked because of the limited numerical resolution . from then on ,",
    "the fluid phases are completely conserved . in contrast , if the term cancelling out allen  cahn law is removed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pf ] ) , the droplet quickly collapses .",
    "the same test can be carried out for a marginal mode in a nearly flat interface with identical results : if the allen  cahn law correction is removed , the mode quickly flatens , whereas , if it is not , some slow dynamics soon gets stacked within the numerical resolution .",
    "this corresponds to the point @xmath71 in fig . 2 ( see next section ) , whose measured growth rate @xmath72 vanishes exactly .",
    "both tests suggest that the @xmath67 term cancels out allen  cahn law even at higher orders in @xmath0 than those computed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as for general situations in which the coupling term can also play a role , significant violation of phase conservation has only been observed for such large values of @xmath0 that @xmath73 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the two fluid phases are conserved for reasonable values of @xmath0 , and that , in practice , this is not a restrictive condition on @xmath0 .",
    "the first physically relevant situation in which we have tested the model is the linear regime of a perturbed planar interface .",
    "the linear dispersion relation has been computed for vanishing viscosity contrast ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "sharp - interface model predicts a linear growth that does not depend on @xmath33 .",
    "however , the phase field model should exhibit some dependence in the viscosity contrast related to the finite-@xmath0 and -@xmath2 corrections ( see ref .",
    "we use a single mode occupying the whole channel width ( i.e. , of wavelength 1 and wavevector @xmath74 ) and then vary the dimensonless surface tension @xmath35 in order to change the growth rate of that mode according to the hele ",
    "shaw dispersion relation @xmath75 this is physically completely equivalent to fixing the surface tension and varying the wavevector of the mode , as can be seen through the rescaling @xmath76 . however , it is numerically more convenient , since it allows one to use the same value of @xmath0 for all the modes , because @xmath47 is fixed . thus , according to the finite-@xmath0 and -@xmath2 dispersion relation derived in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath77 we have used @xmath78 , @xmath79 in order to keep the deviation from the sharp - interface one , @xmath80 , below a 10% ( we have used its maximum , @xmath81 , to compute the required value of @xmath2 ) . finally , the initial amplitude of the mode is chosen to equal the mesh size @xmath57 which in turn is set to @xmath82 for reasons explained below , so that we stay for a while in the linear regime for unstable modes , and yet we have enough numerical subgrid resolution for the stable ones also for a while .    the time evolution of a relevant mode ( one close to the most unstable one ) , with @xmath83",
    ", is shown in fig .",
    "the points ( + ) have been obtained by averaging the ratio of the interface height @xmath14 at a certain time @xmath84 and the initial one @xmath85 over 1/4th of the interface .",
    "the slope of the resulting curve in a linear - log plot is the growth rate . where this is constant",
    ", the growth is exponential and we are in the linear regime .",
    "this corresponds to the linear fit plotted in fig . 1 . , from which we obtain the growth rates shown in fig .",
    "2 . beyond this regime",
    "the points curve down because of the non - linearities .",
    "the crossover corresponds to an amplitude of about a tenth of the wavelength of the mode .",
    "the behaviour of the stream function has been plotted in a dotted line for purposes of comparison . according to the linear theory ( see , e.g. @xcite )",
    ", the absolute value of the stream function at any point of the system should also grow exponentially with the same growth rate than the interface , and this is indeed the case , since the dotted line average over the whole bulk of the absolute value of the ratio between the stream function @xmath16 in a certain point at a certain time @xmath84 and the initial one at the same point @xmath86 is parallel to the interface evolution in the linear regime .",
    "the gap between the two straight lines is due to the initial , very short and therefore not visible in the figure decay of the stream function , which reflects the rounding on a scale of @xmath87 of the gradient on the interface of the sharp - interface result used as initial condition .    in fig .",
    "2 we present the linear dispersion relation thus obtained in the rescaled variables defined above . the points ( + )",
    "correspond to the growth rates measured as in fig .",
    "1 , for times ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 , i.e. , for roughly a decade in the amplitude .",
    "their deviation from the sharp - interface result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdhs ] ) ( solid line ) keeps below the desired 10% error and is fairly well quantitatively predicted by the thin - interface dispersion relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdthin ] ) ( dotted line ) .",
    "this quantitative agreement between theory and numerics is quite remarkable if we take into account that the thin - interface model is based on an asymptotic expansion in @xmath0 .",
    "this good agreement is indeed an indication that the value of @xmath0 used is in the asymptotic regime of the sharp - interface limit , as we will see more clearly in fig .",
    "although we in fact introduce the thin - interface growth rate eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdthin ] ) into the initial condition for the stream function , the results do not depend on this after a certain transient .",
    "if one sets more naively the sharp - interface growth rate @xmath80 into the initial condition for the stream function , one gets a rather long transient in which the slope of an amplitude - time log - linear plot like that of fig .",
    "1 initially curves down ( up ) for an unstable ( stable ) mode , i.e. , the growth is not exponential , and we are therefore not describing properly the hele  shaw problem .",
    "the slope then relaxes towards the thin - interface one and the growth becomes exponential , but non - linearities soon set in .",
    "in contrast , if the thin - interface growth rate is set into the initial stream function , one gets constant slopes from the very beginning .",
    "this allows one to measure the growth rate in a wider range of time and is indeed also an indication that the thin - interface model is valid .",
    "the growth rate values shown in fig .",
    "2 could still be refined by further decreasing @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "this is not only a theoretical possibility , but can also be done in practice as we show in fig .",
    "3 , although the computation time increases as explained above . here , we study the convergence of the growth rate @xmath88 ( y - axis ) for the maximum of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) to the hele  shaw result @xmath91 ( left upper corner ) as we decrease @xmath0 ( x - axis ) and @xmath2 ( various symbols ) .",
    "the empty symbols have been obtained with @xmath92 , whereas the filled ones correspond to @xmath93 .",
    "the growth rates obtained with @xmath92 are always below the ones for @xmath93 , probably because of the stabilizing effect of the mesh size .",
    "if @xmath57 is further decreased the differences with the values computed with @xmath93 are tiny , whereas the gap between the @xmath94 and the @xmath93 points is pretty large ( clearly more than the differences between distinct symbols distinct @xmath2 values or adjacent values of @xmath0 ) .",
    "this means that the discretization has practically converged to the continuum model for @xmath93 , but not for @xmath92 .",
    "that is the reason why we have used @xmath95 in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath93 points should be described by the thin - interface model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdthin ] ) , and this is indeed the case for small enough values of @xmath0 . to visually see this",
    "we have plotted the thin - interface prediction for @xmath96 ( dashed line ) , which is , of course , a straight line in @xmath0 .",
    "each set of points with the same @xmath2 value clearly tend to allign parallel to this line as @xmath0 decreases as eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdthin ] ) predicts , whereas they curve up and even cross the line for large values of @xmath0 , for which we are beyond the asymptotic regime of validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdthin ] ) , apparently ending near @xmath78 .",
    "this makes @xmath78 very suitable for simulations , and confirms it to be within the asymptotic regime as we pointed out above .",
    "note as well how the growth rate increases with decreasing values of @xmath2 within the same value of @xmath0 ( vertical columns of points ) , and how it approaches the dashed line in good agreement with the values predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdthin ] ) for values of @xmath0 within the asymptotic regime .",
    "once the model has been tested in the linear regime , it seems mandatory to check a highly non - linear situation such as the steady state , for which many analytical and numerical results are available .",
    "we start with a single mode occupying the whole channel and with an amplitude equal to the channel width , i.e. , clearly in the non - linear regime .",
    "obviously the initial condition predicted by the linear theory is not accurate , but this just introduces a transient during which the dynamics is not the hele ",
    "shaw one . by the time the forming finger is close to the steady shape , all transients must have decayed .",
    "moreover , starting with a single mode we not only check that the model exhibits a finger solution , which we could do much faster by starting with that solution , but that the model is robust to inaccurate initial conditions for the bulk , and also that single fingers have a reasonable basin of attraction , which may be a rather nontrivial point for small @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "here we do not have a theoretical prediction for the deviations from the hele ",
    "shaw steady state due to finite-@xmath0 and -@xmath2 effects .",
    "however , we know that the inequalities of sec . [ seceqs ] still control the convergence .",
    "the differences are that @xmath88 now stands for the steady advance velocity ( which should be in the range 0.7 - 0.8 , not far from the maximum growth rate in the linear regime @xmath81 ) , and that all unstable modes and not only the one set by the initial condition are present in the steady state , so that @xmath47 must be choosen to be the less favourable in each inequality .",
    "this continues to be @xmath74 for the condition on @xmath2 , but becomes @xmath97 , the most unstable mode , for the one on @xmath0 .",
    "we thus progressively decrease the values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 and look for convergence ( in the finger widths ) within the computational resources .",
    "the finest comparable simulation runs are shown in figs .",
    "4.a - d . for @xmath98 ( figs .",
    "4.a - c ) we have used @xmath99 , twice less accurate than the one used in the linear regime ( figs . 1 - 2 ) , whereas for @xmath100 ( fig .",
    "4.d ) @xmath78 , three times less accurate . as for @xmath2 ,",
    "we have used @xmath101 for @xmath53 ( figs .",

    "4.b ) , and @xmath103 for @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "4.c ) , all of them twice less accurate than the one in the linear regime .",
    "however , convergence in @xmath2 seems to be achieved , at least in the finger widths .",
    "we can not assure it for @xmath0 because the finger tip splits for @xmath100 probably because of numerical noise if @xmath0 is further lowered . in all cases",
    "we have used @xmath93 like in the linear regime tests , although we have found that already for @xmath92 , the differences in widths are at most within a 1% . figs .",
    "4.a - d show single fingers that are formed and relax to a certain width to just advance with a steady velocity .",
    "this can be measured plotting the tip position against time , finding excellent linearity from @xmath105 to at least @xmath106 ( for the fastest finger ) .",
    "four successive interfaces at constant time intervals are shown covering this whole regime . except for the @xmath104 case of fig .",
    "4.c , the finger has not completely relaxed to its final width for the first plotted interface , which means that we are not in the steady state yet . from the second to the last shown interfaces , no observable change in width , tip velocity or shape is seen anymore .",
    "taking into account that figs .",
    "4.a - d show the whole channel although simulations were carried out using half ( @xmath107 ) or a quarter ( @xmath53 ) of it it is clear from fig .",
    "4.d that the end of the channel can be set even closer to the tip of the finger than a channel width ( i.e. , closer than what the linear regime would have suggested ) .",
    "regarding to the values of this steady velocity , they are always a 10 - 20% below what predicted for an ( infinite ) saffman  taylor finger of the same width without surface tension , although velocity does increase with decreasing finger width as can be seen comparing figs 4.a and 4.d . the origin of this quantitative discrepancy must lie necessarily on finite-@xmath0 and -@xmath2 effects , most likely related to the non - laplacian character introduced by @xmath2 , which produces a finite diffusion length .",
    "note that @xmath53 fingers ( figs .",
    "4.a and 4.d ) are up - down symmetric",

    "4.a is compared to 4.b and 4.c ( all with @xmath98 but increasing viscosity contrast @xmath33 ) , one sees that the higher the viscosity contrast , the longer the saffman  taylor finger and the shorter the drop part ( the initial condition was centered about y=0 ) .",

    "this @xmath33-dependence can also be seen in fig . 1 of ref",
    "quantitative comparison with mclean  saffman numerical solvability theory results for @xmath108 is only feasible to some extent if @xmath108 widths are extrapolated from the @xmath109 ones obtained , since our model can not treat the limiting case @xmath110 . by doing this for @xmath98 (",

    "we have finally tested the model in the non - linear dynamics appearing between the precedent situations , i.e. after the departure of the linear regime and before reaching the steady state .",

    "we include some of them anyway",
    ". then all modes are added up to find the interface position .",
    "the stream function predicted by the linear theory is also obtained by adding up each mode s stream function , but all with their peaks centered at the same final interface position , to avoid the formation of more than one peak of the stream function across the interface .",
    "since harmonics of the channel width are present , we have to refine the @xmath0 used in the linear regime .",
    "we use @xmath124 , with @xmath92 to save computation time .",
