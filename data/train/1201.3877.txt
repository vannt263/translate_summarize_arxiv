    "quantum dynamics of an oscillator is naturally described by fock states , however , these states are hard to create in experiments .",
    "the reason is that excitations of oscillatory systems usually lead to the production of thermal states or coherent states but not quantum fock states .",
    "nevertheless , quantum oscillatory states can be prepared and can be manipulated by coupling oscillators to atomic systems . in this way , a classical pulse applied to the atomic states creates a quantum state that can subsequently be transferred to the harmonic oscillator excited in a coherent state .",

    "we consider nonlinear dissipative oscillator the ( ndo ) under sequence of classical gaussian pulses separated by time intervals .",
    "the nonlinearity effects in the ndo should be enough to break the equidistant of oscillatory energy levels . in this case",

    "it is demonstrated that the creation of oscillatory nonclassical states can be realized in a periodically pulsed oscillator with complete consideration of decoherence effects and in a regime of strong kerr nonlinearity .",
    "it is well assessed , that in a free decoherence regime an anharmonic oscillator leads to schrdinger cat states which are destroyed due to dissipation and decoherence .",
    "this situation of vanishing quantum superposition states of the ndo in an over transient dissipative operational regime has been strongly demonstrated within the framework of the wigner function that visualizes quantum interference as negative values in the phase space .",
    "really surprisingly analytical results for the wigner functions of the ndo under monochromatic excitation have been analytically obtained @xcite , @xcite in the steady - state regime that are positive in all ranges of the phase space .",

    "these states can be created for time intervals exceeding the characteristic time of decoherence .",
    "the corresponding wigner functions of the oscillatory mode show ranges of negative values and gradually deviate from the wigner function of an ndo driven by monochromatic driving .",
    "previously , a driven ndo operated in a quantum regime has become more important in both fundamental and applied sciences , particularly , for the implementation of basic quantum optical systems in the engineering of nonclassical states and quantum logic . in these systems , the efficiency of the quantum effects requires a high nonlinearity with respect to dissipation . on the other hand ,",
