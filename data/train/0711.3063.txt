    "strangeness production process in nucleon - nucleon collisions has attracted considerable theoretical interest since high precision data have been published in the past few years@xcite .",
    "this field is fascinating for several reasons .",
    "first of all , strangeness production in nucleon - nucleon collisions is an elementary process , and their cross sections are an fundamental input into transport model calculations of the strangeness production in heavy ion collisions . furthermore , strangeness production process may provide information on the strange components of the nucleon and deepen our knowledge on the internal structure of nucleon@xcite . finally , for the short life time of hyperons , it is difficult to accumulate a large set of scattering events and obtain accurate scattering parameters .",
    "final state interaction ( fsi ) in strangeness production can supply us with assistant information on the kn and yn interaction .",
    "a series of theoretical models@xcite have given excellent description to the observed energy dependence of the total cross section for the strangeness production process @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "some of these models@xcite also give a reasonable explanation to the energy dependence of the ratio @xmath10 .",
    "compared to the detailed experimental and theoretical investigation in these two channels , there is only limited data on the total cross section for @xmath11 .",
    "a recent cosy - anke data@xcite indicates a rather small near - threshold total cross section , which is much smaller than previous cosy-11 data@xcite . for the large error bar of these experimental data",
    ", any definite conclusion can not be surely drawn at present , and it must be checked in future experiments .    on the other hand , as a good isospin-3/2 filter without complication caused by @xmath12 contribution , @xmath11 is an excellent channel for the investigation of @xmath13 resonance@xcite .",
    "it is necessary to deepen our theoretical understanding to the controversial experimental data . in this paper",
    ", we use a resonance model and its nonrelativistic parametrization to explore the energy dependence of the total cross section of the @xmath14 . in section",
    "ii we introduce the feynman diagrams and the effective lagrangian approach within resonance model . in section",
    "iii we present a exploration to the near threshold region within a nonrelativistic parametrization and give a set of fsi parameters . in section iv , we give the numerical results and explore their implications , especially in the near threshold region .",
    "section v provides a summary .",
    "the treatment of the elementary processes @xmath15 is tree level at the hadronic level in the resonance model@xcite , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "all interference terms between different amplitudes are neglected because the relative phases of these amplitudes can not be fixed by the scarce experimental data .",
    "mesons exchanged are restricted to those observed in the decay channels of the adopted resonances , and kaon exchange is not included in the calculation .",
    "thus , all values of the coupling constants are fixed by the experimental decay ratios , and the only adjustable parameters are cut - off parameters in the form factors . in this model",
    ", only @xmath16 through @xmath6 exchange contributes to the @xmath17 channel above the production threshold .",
    "the relevant meson - nucleon - nucleon(mnn ) and resonance - nucleon(hyperon)-meson effective lagrangians for evaluating the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "1 are :    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    where @xmath21,@xmath22,@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the rarita - schwinger spin wave function of the nucleon , the resonance , the kaon and the pion respectively , @xmath25 the pauli matrices , @xmath26 the spin-3/2 matrices and @xmath27 .",
    "the effective lagrangians for the resonance @xmath12 please refer to @xcite .    for the propagators of @xmath28 meson and the spin-3/2 @xmath16 resonance , the usual rarita - schwinger propagators",
    "are used :    @xmath29    @xmath30 , \\ ] ]    with @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the four momentum of @xmath28 meson and @xmath16 resonance respectively , @xmath33 and @xmath34 the corresponding masses .",
    "the relations between the branching ratios and the coupling constants then can be calculated using the relevant lagrangians .",
    "take @xmath35 as an example :    @xmath36    @xmath37    here @xmath38",
    ". then the coupling constants can be determined through the empirical branching ratios .",
    "values related to @xmath16 are summarized in table i@xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath39 and @xmath40 vertexes are multiplied by form factors which dampen out high values of the exchanged momentum :    @xmath41    with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 being the cut - off parameter , four - momentum and mass of the exchanged meson .",
    "@xmath45 as the widely used value@xcite .",
    "the form factor of the @xmath46 vertex is 1 .",
    ".relevant @xmath47 parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as to @xmath11 channel , if the only contribution comes from resonance @xmath16 through @xmath48 exchange , the corresponding amplitude can be obtained straightforwardly by applying the feynman rules to fig . 1 :    @xmath49    @xmath50    final state interaction influences the near - threshold behavior significantly .",
    "it has been experimentally and theoretically verified that @xmath51 fsi is essential to the @xmath52 process .",
    "similarly , here only @xmath2 interaction is considered with watson - migdal factorization@xcite , and @xmath53 interaction will not be taken into account for its weakness@xcite :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the enhancement factor describing the @xmath2 final state interaction and goes to unity in the limit of no fsi , as expected by the physical picture .",
    "similar to the @xmath51 fsi in the @xmath56 channel , we assume that @xmath55 can be taken to be jost function@xcite :    @xmath57    @xmath58    with @xmath59 being the excess energy .",
    "the related scattering length and effective range are :    @xmath60    then the total cross section can be calculated by :    @xmath61    with the flux factor @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 is the square of the invariant scattering amplitude , averaged over the initial spins and summed over the final spins .",
    "the integration over the phase space can be performed by monte carlo program .    for the lack of the @xmath2 scattering data , a set of data",
    "are employed referring to the @xmath51 interaction@xcite in the ref.@xcite s calculation :    @xmath64    the corresponding scattering length and effective range are :    @xmath65    next we will concentrate on the relation between fsi and the near - threshold total cross section , and try to find some clues on the @xmath2 interaction . as a matter fact ,",
    "we fix scattering length and effective range with a nonrelativistic parametrization , assuming no possible quasi - bound or molecular state .",
    "it is generally agreed that the energy variation of the total cross section for the @xmath56 and @xmath66 is fixed mainly by the @xmath67 factor coming from phase space , modified by the fsi in the near - threshold region :    @xmath68    if @xmath63 depend smoothly on the excess energy , eq .",
    "can be parameterized as@xcite :    @xmath69    @xmath70    where @xmath71 , the fsi factor , was firstly put forward by g. f@xmath72ldt and c. wilkin@xcite . at sufficiently large @xmath59",
    ", @xmath73 and fsi can be isolated .",
    "it is noted that the nonrelativistic phase space factor is used in the above equation , and this is a good approximation up to excess energies of @xmath74 . in order to give some clues to the @xmath2 interaction , the physical mechanism of strangeness production",
    "will not be concerned , and @xmath63 is parameterized as @xmath75 .",
    "similar parametrization@xcite has give an excellent description to the energy dependence of the total cross section for the @xmath56 , @xmath76 and the ratio @xmath10 .    if parameters in fsi factor are employed to be the same with eq .",
    ", and @xmath77 ( @xmath59 in gev ) , the total cross section for @xmath11 as a function of excess energy can be exhibited by the solid curve in fig .",
    "2 . it gives a reasonable description to the total cross section in high energies and underestimates the cosy-11 data , which is consistent with the numerical calculation below(see fig.3 ) .",
    "this verifies the applicability of the parametrization eq ..    if @xmath2 fsi is negligible ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 , the result is dashed curve in fig .",
    "2 . it still overestimates cosy - anke data by a factor of about 3 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the pure phase space behavior is favored by so small near - threshold total cross section , as indicated by the dotted curve with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this means that @xmath2 fsi is negligible , similar to the @xmath82 fsi in @xmath9 , but the scattering amplitude is more weakly dependent on the excess energy . if the near - threshold total cross section is really as small as cosy - anke data@xcite , the nearly constant scattering amplitude is the extraordinary character for @xmath11 channel .",
    "however , in order to reproduce cosy-11 data , totally different parameters should be adopted :    @xmath83    @xmath84    the result is the dash - dotted curve in fig .",
    "the corresponding scattering length @xmath85 ( with @xmath86 ) is contrary to the values used in the ref.@xcite s calculation ( eq . ) and implies an even stronger @xmath2 interaction .",
    "it is worth noting that the scattering parameters of @xmath4 interaction are @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in the next section",
    "we will give a comparison between these two sets of @xmath3 fsi parameters , and show that a better reproduce to the large near - threshold total cross section is achieved with eq ..",
    "the contribution from resonance @xmath16 through @xmath6 exchange with fsi parameters in eq . is shown as the dotted curve in fig .",
    "3 . note that the resonance @xmath16 can be treated as an effective resonance which represents all contributions of six resonances ( @xmath89,@xmath90,@xmath91,@xmath16,@xmath92 , and @xmath93 ) and the coupling constants relevant to @xmath16 are scaled multiplying by a factor@xcite . the numerical result ( the dashed curve in fig .",
    "3 ) reproduces the data in high energies reasonably well but underestimates cosy-11 data by a factor of orders , as pointed out in above section .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that the inclusion of a ignored sub - threshold resonance @xmath94 ( both @xmath95 and @xmath6 exchange are included ) , together with a strong @xmath2 fsi in eq . , would achieve much better agreement , as illustrated by the solid curve in fig .",
    "unfortunately , it still underpredicts two near - threshold data points .",
    "it is argued@xcite that improvement can be achieved by inclusion of the interference term between @xmath95 and @xmath6 exchange . however , this kind of interference term is very small as demonstrated in another channel @xmath56@xcite , and it definitely can not provide any interpretation to this relatively large discrepancy .",
    "the numerical result showed by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "3 agrees cosy - anke data , which was obtained at a little higher energy and shows a rather small total cross section in near - threshold region , as indicated by a closed star in fig .",
    "3 .    the numerical results with the fsi parameters in eq .",
    "are given in fig.4 . the contribution from resonance @xmath16 through @xmath6 exchange",
    "is not affected much by the alteration of the fsi parameters , and still gives a small near - threshold total cross section .",
    "this indicates that the contribution from resonance @xmath16 is not sensitive to the magnitude of the @xmath2 interaction , and we would be not able to distill any valuable information about the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "however , the contribution from resonance @xmath96 gives an even larger near - threshold cross section , and the resulting curve reproduces all previous published data reasonably , as illustrated by the solid curve in fig .",
    "this strongly suggests a rather strong @xmath2 interaction if the near - threshold cross section is as large as cosy-11 data@xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that this is incompatible to the known yn scattering data .",
    "besides , the @xmath97 interaction is found to be weak in @xmath98 channel , and the naive speculation is that the @xmath2 interaction should be weak , too .",
    "one may further expect that the energy dependence of the @xmath14 is approximately the same with that of @xmath9@xcite .",
    "anyway , due to the scarcity and uncertainty of those experimental data , the conclusion that these data imply a highly anomaly near - threshold behavior can not be definitely drawn yet .",
    "based on these numerical result , we may also conclude that contribution from @xmath96 is indispensable for a good reproduce to the large near - threshold total cross section , which has been discussed deeply in the ref.@xcite .",
    "we presented the confusion caused by the existing data for @xmath17 channel .",
    "the numerical result and parametrization analysis reveal a large discrepancy between two sets of near - threshold data , which means totally different @xmath2 interaction .",
    "the theoretical results presented in other works@xcite also indicated that the total cross section data alone can not distinguish different production mechanisms . in order to clarify the confusion that if there was a highly abnormal near - threshold behavior in @xmath11 channel , it is necessary to accumulate a data set with high accuracy and large statistics .",
    "further measurements are being planned in cosy - anke@xcite . besides , a significant improvement is to be expected through the installation of cooling storage ring ( csr ) in lanzhou , china , which is designed for the study of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it can provide @xmath99 proton beam and perform accurate measurement to differential observables and invariant mass spectrum . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors proposed a scheme to study the role of the fsi by analyzing dalitz plot distribution , and experiment performed by cosy - tof collaboration@xcite verified their prediction .",
    "similar analysis may also clarify the confusion in @xmath0 channel .",
    "so csr s data may offer an opportunity to explore the reaction mechanism for the strange production process in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "only then it is possible to achieve an acceptable confidence level for the near - threshold behavior and the dynamical mechanism in the @xmath17 channel .",
    "we would like to thank j. j. xie and b. s. zou for fruitful discussions and program code .",
    "we also thank colin wilkin for a careful reading of the draft and valuable comments .",
