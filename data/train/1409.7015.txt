    "this paper addresses two fundamental questions in gromov  witten ( gw ) theory :    1 .   ruan s crepant resolution conjecture ( crc ) which states that the gw theory of an orbifold should be related to that of a crepant resolution , and 2 .   the gromov  witten / donaldson  thomas correspondence ( gw / dt ) of maulik  nekrasov  okounkov  pandharipande @xcite which states that the gw theory of a calabi - yau ( cy ) threefold should be related to the donaldson ",
    "thomas theory of that same threefold .    more specifically , for @xmath2 a crepant resolution of a hard - lefschetz orbifold , bryan",
    "young @xcite conjectured the following square of equivalences : @xmath3 where all equalities consist of an identification of variables in the formal series , followed by analytic continuation .",
    "this paper completes our understanding of the square of equivalences when @xmath4 is a toric cy @xmath0-orbifold with transverse @xmath1-singularities ( ie .",
    "the orbifold structure is cyclic and supported on disjoint torus lines ) .",
    "prior to this work , for @xmath4 a toric cy @xmath0-orbifold with transverse @xmath1-singularities , the top equality was a theorem of maulik  oblomkov  okounkov  pandharipande @xcite while the right equality was a theorem of the author @xcite .",
    "partial results concerning the left and bottom equalities were obtained by coates ",
    "tseng , zhou , brini  cavalieri ",
    "ross @xcite and ross  zong , zong @xcite , respectively . building upon these partial results we prove the following ( see section [ sec : results ] for precise statements ) .",
    "let @xmath4 be a toric cy @xmath0-orbifold with transverse @xmath1-singularities .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the all genus , primary gw potential of @xmath4 and let @xmath6 denote the reduced , multi - regular dt potential of @xmath4 .",
    "then there is an explicit identification of formal parameters so that @xmath7    theorem [ thm : gwdt ] completes the bottom equality in the square .",
    "composing the bottom , right , and top equalities we deduce the following .",
    "let @xmath2 be the toric crepant resolution of @xmath4.then there is an explicit affine - linear identification of formal parameters so that @xmath8    there is no need for analytic continuation in either of our theorems because the generating series can all be expressed as rational functions in an appropriate set of variables .",

    "@xcite . essentially , the topological vertex asserts that the gw or dt theory of a toric cy @xmath0-fold can be reduced to the study of a local generating series defined at each torus fixed point . in gw theory , the local theory is a generating series of ( orbifold ) hodge integrals ( or _ open _ gw invariants ) . in dt theory , the local theory is a generating series of piles of ( colored ) boxes .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that theorem [ thm : gwdt ] could be reduced to a local correspondence on the level of the topological vertex .",
    "the main content of this paper is a proof of that local statement ( theorem [ thm : vertexcorrespondence ] ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : vertexcorrespondence ] is rather roundabout , and relies heavily on previous work . essentially , theorem [ thm : vertexcorrespondence ] is the composition of three previous results : the open crc of brini  cavalieri ",
    "ross @xcite , the gw / dt correspondence of maulik  oblomkov  okounkov  pandharipande @xcite , and the dt vertex crc of the author @xcite .",
    "once theorem [ thm : gwdt ] is proved , theorem [ thm : crc ] follows quickly .      in section [ sec : results ] , we define the relevant gw and dt potentials and we give precise statements of theorems [ thm : gwdt ] and [ thm : crc ] . in section [ sec : local ] we introduce the orbifold vertex both in gw and dt theory . these are generating series associated to each torus fixed point in @xmath4 . in section",
