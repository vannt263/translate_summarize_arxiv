    "contributions from the nearby source and galactic and extragalactic diffuse backgrounds were estimated based on the spectral fit and subtracted from the light curve    a search was made for periodic modulation by calculating the periodogram of the light curve . since the exposure of the time bins was variable , the contribution of each time bin to the power spectrum was weighted based on its relative exposure .",

    "the period and its error from the lat observations were estimated using a monte - carlo approach : light curves were simulated using the observed  light curve and randomly shuffling the data points within their statistical errors , assuming gaussian statistics .",
    "the corresponding periodogram was then calculated and the location of the peak at @xmath1926.5 days recorded . from @xmath19250,000 simulations the distribution of values gives an estimation of the measured orbital period and its associated error of 26.6 @xmath1 0.5 days ( 1@xmath25 ) .",

    ". the overall light curve can be fit reasonable well by a simple sine wave , yielding a reduced @xmath36 of 1.4 for 1682 d.o.f .",
    "however , if we use the known orbital period and ephemeris of the system @xcite to fit a sine wave to each of the individual 9 orbits observed then we find that the best fit amplitude varies between 6.8@xmath10.9 and 2.2@xmath10.9 @xmath3010@xmath37 ph @xmath3 s@xmath4 , which suggests some orbit - to - orbit variability .",
    "the possibility of the spectral shape changing across the orbit was explored by running gtlike fits for phase - folded bins of 0.1 width .",
    "the reduced statistics in each phase bin result in a cutoff not being statistically required to fit the data and so a simple power law model is used .",
    "there is no significant dependence of photon index on phase ; a fit to a constant value returns a reduced @xmath36 of 1.4 for 9 d.o.f , consistent with no variation .",

    "light curve peaks around phase 0.3 , which is compatible with periastron passage ( when the compact object is closest to the be star ) according to the latest radial velocity studies @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the behavior at very high energies where peak flux occurs at phases 0.6 - 0.7 and detections are achieved only at phases ranging from 0.5 to 0.8 , before or at apastron . in x - rays ,  also appears to peak at phases 0.6 - 0.7 whereas the radio peak occurs over a wide range of phases depending upon a 4-year super - orbital cycle @xcite .",
    "the average _ fermi _ and egret spectra have compatible power law indices and fluxes taking into account systematics , but the _ fermi _ spectrum also shows a cutoff at approximately 6 gev .",
    "there is no evidence for a phase - dependence of the spectral shape and hence , the index or cutoff energy . veritas reports upper limits during the only vhe observations that are contemporary with _ fermi _ , covering only part of one orbit from phase 0 to 0.75 ( up to 2008 november 9 , * ? ? ?",
    "the later phases have short exposure times .",
    "moreover , the past vhe history of the source shows several non - detections at phases 0.60.7 @xcite , perhaps due to variability from one orbital cycle to the other .",
    "the _ fermi _ light curve displays signs of orbit - to - orbit variability superposed on the mean behavior , with the primary peak always around phase 0.3 .",
    "such variability could be attributed to changing conditions in the be star wind , affecting the interaction with the pulsar wind or relativistic jet . indeed , optical spectra show evidence for changes in wind emission with the orbit .    the obvious radiative process to invoke in the he and vhe range is inverse compton scattering of the abundant stellar photons into gamma rays by a population of electrons accelerated in the vicinity of the compact object ( e.g. in a relativistic jet or in a pulsar wind ) .",
    "then , all else being equal , the peak flux phase is determined by where the seed photon density is highest and by geometry ; favorable when the high energy electrons are seen behind the star by the observer , e.g. .",
    "superior conjunction is close in phase to periastron passage in  ( @xmath39 to 0.17 depending on the orbital solution ) .",
    "hence , having the _ fermi _ flux peak close to periastron is consistent with inverse compton emission from electrons located close to the compact object .",
    "the cutoff in the average spectrum could arise due to radiative losses ( because of different accelerating conditions for electrons , because of the magnetic field amplitude in the relativistic jet or the pulsar wind along the orbit and/or because of the greater photon density at periastron ) , or due to a varying maximum energy for accelerated electrons or to pair production on stellar photons for gamma rays above @xmath4050 gev . in the latter case ,",
    "cascade emission might also be seen in the _ fermi _ range .",
    "all these effects introduce phase - dependent spectral changes .",
    "hadronic interactions related to crossings of the be star s equatorial wind ( disk ) could also contribute @xcite .",
    "this would provide an independently varying spectral component to explain why the he and vhe emission peak at different phases and vary with orbital cycle .",
    "the expectation is that hadronic interactions would result in two asymmetric peaks in the light curve whose amplitude depends upon the intercepted matter density during the crossings and occuring at phases _ a priori _ unrelated to periastron passage but on the orientation of the orbit of the compact object relative to the be star disk .",
    "continued monitoring by _ fermi _ combined with dedicated campaigns by pointed instruments is needed to better constrain spectral variability and establish the multiwavelength connections : how do orbit - to - orbit variations compare in different energy ranges ? are there separate he and vhe spectral components ?",
    "the _ fermi_-lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a. wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden .",
