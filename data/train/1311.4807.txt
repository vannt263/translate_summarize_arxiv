    "in this paper , we seek to apply stein s method  a technique for obtaining convergence ( often clt - type ) results for random variables  on a vertex - count in the neighborhood attack voter - type model .",
    "voter models are interacting - particle - system models on finite graphs . the original voter model ( introduced independently in the 1970s by clifford and sudbury in 1973 , and by holley and liggett in 1975 , as mentioned in @xcite ) can be formulated as follows : take a connected , @xmath2-regular ( each vertex has @xmath2 edges ) graph of size @xmath3 .",
    "assign @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s to the nodes of the graph . run a markov chain on the graph with the following transition procedure : each turn , pick a node at random ( under some distribution ; usually we take the uniform ) , pick one of its neighbors at random ( usually uniformly ) , and switch the value of the selected neighbor - node to the value of the originally selected node . under uniformity of node and neighbor selection",
    ", this chain converges to one of two absorbing states , in which all nodes have the same values .",
    "the `` anti - voter '' model , introduced in @xcite , has the selected neighbour node adopt a value opposite to that of the originally selected node . under uniformity ( again , of node and neighbor selection )",
    "the resulting chain has a stationary distribution .",
    "persi diaconis and christos athanasiadis in @xcite proposed the following variation of the voter model : upon selecting a node , instead of picking one of its neighbors , flip a coin ( with weight @xmath4 , perhaps taken to be a half ) , and , according to the result of the cointoss , assign either @xmath0 or @xmath1 to the selected nodes and all its neighbors .",
    "the model has been labeled the `` neighborhood attack '' model .",
    "stein s method ( first introduced in @xcite ) provides an infrastructure for the estimation of the distances between certain classes of random variables and certain ( usually classical ) distributions , most notably the gaussian and the poisson distributions . for practical purposes",
    ", we can break stein s method into three key steps : first , one has to use stein s identities to establish a bound on the distance between a class of random variables and a specific distribution expected to be close to the given class ; second , one has to satisfy the conditions generated in the preceding step ; and third , one has to evaluate the acquired bound .",
    "the last step typically involves something along the lines of reducing an expression involving a function of the variance of the given random variable .    in @xcite ,",
    "yosef rinott and vladimir rotar show , using a stein s method argument , that the sum of the values of the nodes in the anti - voter model at stationarity is asymptotically normally distributed .",
    "the problem rinnott and rotar tackled was posed by aldous and fill in a book that touches on voter models , @xcite .",
    "our goal in the present article is to show that the sum of the values of the nodes in the neighborhood attack model is asymptotically normally distributed , using stein s method techniques different from the ones employed by rinott and rotar .",
    "for an application of the stein technique in a different context , see the paper @xcite , in which jason fulman shows that the number of descents or inversions in permutations complies to a central limit theorem .",
    "both the current problem and the one examined in @xcite can be viewed as random walks on hyperplanes ; and hence there is a structural similarity between the approach adopted here , and the one in @xcite .    for more results on the neighbourhood attack model , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the former paper introduces the model and presents some results on random walks on hyperplane arrangements .",
    "the latter paper studies some properties of the distributions of the implicit markov chains in models similar to the neighbourhood attack model .    for more on stein s method , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the first two books provide a comprehensive overview of stein s method in regard to its applications to normal and poisson approximations reflexively .",
    "the monograph @xcite is an up - to - date survey of stein s method literature and a useful entry - level source on the subject .    in section [ sectionproblemapproach ] ,",
    "we pose our problem . in section [ sectionsm ]",
    ", we conduct a brief overview of our main technique : stein s method . in section [ sectionresults ]",
    ", we introduce a few definitions and assumptions , and then list the main result of the paper . in the section [ sectionproof ] , we provide calculations and proofs for the result .",
    "section [ sectionconsequences ] interprets the result with some examples of its applicability .",
    "we draw conclusions in section [ sectionconclusions ] .",
    "we apply the neighbourhood attack model ( introduced in @xcite ) on a given family of ( finite ) graphs .",
    "randomly assign either @xmath0 or @xmath1 to each node of the graph . as mentioned above",
    ", the model does the following each turn :    * selects a node uniformly at random .",
    "* turns the node and all its immediate neighbours into @xmath0 s or @xmath1 s according to a bernoulli(@xmath4 ) distribution with @xmath5 ; we want @xmath6 for the sake of symmetry .",
    "given : 1 ) a connected graph ; 2 ) positive probability of selection for all nodes ; and 3 ) positive probabilities of turning into @xmath0 or @xmath1 for the selected node and its neighbours , the underlying markov chain , the states of which are the possible permutations of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s , is irreducible and everywhere recurrent on an essential class of its state space , and therefore possesses a stationary distribution . assume the considered markov chain begins at this stationary distribution .",
    "let @xmath7 be the number of @xmath0 s at stationarity .",
    "then @xmath8 equals the number of @xmath1 s , where @xmath9 is the number of nodes .",
    "we want to use stein s method to show that @xmath10 { } \\mathcal{z}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is of the standard normal distribution , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the expectation and standard deviation of @xmath7 .",
    "we derive our result under an assumption of @xmath2-regularity for the underlying graphs .    we seek to apply stein s method , and in particular we want to use a result along the lines of theorem 1.2 in @xcite :    [ theorem1 ] let @xmath14 be exchangeable with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    ".    our @xmath33 would be some normalization of a vertex - count on the voter - type model graphs we deal with .",
    "stein s technique goes as follows : for a given probability distribution , one can come up with an appropriate operator which implicitly defines the distribution . for example , the operator @xmath20 in @xmath34 implicitly defines the gaussian distribution , in the sense that 1 ) @xmath35 for all absolutely continuous @xmath36 with @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a variable with the standard normal distribution ; and 2 ) if for some random variable @xmath33 we have @xmath39 for all absolutely continuous functions",
    "@xmath36 with @xmath40 , then @xmath33 has the standard normal distribution .",
    "next , for an appropriately chosen @xmath20 , one can solve the differential equation given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the c.d.f .",
    "of the target distribution .",
    "but now , armed with the solution to equation ( [ eq : steindiffeq ] ) , and within the context of an appropriate metric ( above we used the kolomogorov metric ) , we can produce a bound on the distance @xmath43 between a given distribution we want to analyze , and the target distribution with c.d.f . @xmath42 .",
    "for example , @xmath44 is the unique bounded solution to @xmath45 where @xmath42 is the c.d.f . of the standard normal . and next , under the wasserstein metric given by @xmath46 , one can show that ( for example , see @xcite ) @xmath47}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is a normalized sum of @xmath3 i.i.d .",
    "standard normal variables endowed with a fourth moment , and @xmath48 stands for the wasserstein distance between @xmath33 and the standard normal distribution .",
    "the potential utility of stein s technique in producing powerful bounds and obtaining convergence results is clear ; and , indeed , stein s method has been instrumental in the proofs of a variety of interesting convergence and bounding results . in general , there are two standard avenues of research focusing on stein s method  one can try to obtain formulas for bounds on the distances between various target distributions and various random variables ( or rather , their distributions )  examples of recent results in this direction include @xcite ( exponential distribution ) , @xcite ( laplace ) , and @xcite ( zero - bias couplings and concentration inequalities ) ; and one can use these formulas and techniques to obtain results pertaining to specific problems , including many classic problems such as the birthday problem or the coupon collector problem  for examples , refer to @xcite ( comprehensive survey ) and @xcite ( lightbulb process ) .",
    "we first seek to show that ( [ steinpaireq ] ) holds . to that end , let @xmath7 be the number of 1 s at stationarity . let @xmath49 here @xmath9 is the total number of nodes and @xmath50 is the value of node @xmath51 ( under an arbitrary indexing ) .",
    "examining @xmath52 is equivalent to examining @xmath7 .",
    "next , define @xmath53 note @xmath54 is a constant dependent on @xmath9 : @xmath55 now , @xmath33 is mean-0 variance-1 . to get the condition for theorem [ theorem1 ]",
    ", we first need to define a @xmath56 as the equivalent of @xmath33 after one further turn of the neighborhood attack model .",
    "that is to say , if @xmath33 is the normalized node count of the model at some turn of its evolution in stationarity , then @xmath56 is the same normalized node count in the next turn .",
    "note , once again , that we assume @xmath2-regularity for the graph ( i.e. every node has exactly @xmath2 neighbours ) .",
    "we want @xmath2-regularity for the sake of symmetry , because without symmetry , the problem under consideration is far less tractable .",

    "given the @xmath2-regularity assumption , the sum @xmath66 changes each turn by between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "a basic example of a graph of this type is the circle ( 2-regular ) graph , in which we have a set of nodes arranged in a circle , each node with two neighbours .",
    "we also assumed uniformity in choosing nodes and in flipping @xmath0 s or @xmath1 s . under such conditions @xmath69 ,",
    "i.e. at stationarity each node is @xmath0 or @xmath1 with equal probability .",
    "the sum of the node values will tend toward 0 ( under certain conditions ; one of which , clearly , has to do with the number of neighbors each node has , since our model takes only the extreme values over the complete graph ) , since if nodes of a certain value ( @xmath70 or @xmath1 ) dominate the graph , we are less likely to see an increase in the number of the nodes of that value .",
    "we show in section [ sectionvariancey ] that , as desired , @xmath71 which complies with the stein linearity condition ( [ steinpaireq ] ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is a random variable . in our case",
    "conveniently @xmath75 .",
    "as for lambda , @xmath76      in general , the next step is to show that @xmath33 and @xmath56 are exchangeable , i.e. @xmath77 , as was done in @xcite .",
    "exchangeability clearly holds when the markov chain underlying @xmath33 and @xmath56 is stationary and reversible .",
    "reversibility is not always available or easily proved .",
    "for example , our chain is clearly not necessarily reversible . consider the circle graph .",
    "it is easy to see that for @xmath9 large , @xmath52 can take the value @xmath78  i.e. there is an attainable at stationarity arrangement of values for the nodes in which all nodes but one have the value of 1 .",
    "now , the probability of going from that arrangement to the all 1 s arrangement for which @xmath79 is positive ; but the probability of going from @xmath79 to @xmath80 is zero , and hence our chain fails to satisfy the detailed balance equations @xmath81 .    however , a recent result by adrian rllin removes the necessity for exchangeability .",
    "rllin s theorem ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.1 ) ) states :    [ rollin ] assume @xmath82 are r.v.s on the same probability space , s.t .",
    "@xmath83 ( @xmath84 for law ) , @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "given @xmath87 , for @xmath88 ( here @xmath11 is the standard normal distribution , and @xmath23 is the family of functions associated with the wasserstein distance ) , we have @xmath89 if also there exists a constant @xmath20 s.t .",

    "for an explicit formula for the value of the corresponding @xmath54 in the anti - voter model , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 14 ) .",
    "another relevant paper dealing with the anti - voter case can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us first try to find @xmath98 .",
    "define @xmath99 to obtain @xmath100 .    by stationarity",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath103 takes values between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and that the probability distribution of @xmath103 is a function of certain edge and vertex counts on the coloured graph , themselves random variables . specifically :    define @xmath104 as the number of nodes s.t .",
    "the sum of the values at the node and all its neighbors equals @xmath51 .",
    "clearly , @xmath51 takes integer values ( all odd or all even depending on the parity of @xmath2 ) between @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "specifically , if @xmath2 is odd , @xmath51 takes the values @xmath107 ; and if @xmath2 is even , @xmath51 takes the values @xmath108 . in each case",
    "@xmath51 takes @xmath109 distinct values .",
    "call the set of those values ( the possible values @xmath51 can take ) @xmath58 .",
    "simple counting produces two useful identities involving the @xmath104 s : @xmath110    now , at each turn of the neighborhood attack process we pick a node uniformly at random ( i.e. with probability @xmath111 ) , and turn its value and the value of all its neighbors to either @xmath0 or @xmath1 uniformly at random ( i.e. with probability @xmath112 ) .",
    "it thus follows that @xmath103 has the ( conditional on @xmath113 ) p.d.f .",
    ": @xmath114 so for example , @xmath103 takes the value of @xmath115 with probability @xmath116 ; and the value @xmath117 with probability @xmath118 .",

    "one is tempted to try to use the fkg inequality to prove @xmath155 .",
    "specifically , we know that the lattice @xmath157 ( where @xmath158 is our graph ) is a poset ; and that @xmath159 is an increasing function of that lattice , while @xmath160 is a decreasing function on the same lattice . moreover , if we take an element @xmath161 from @xmath157 , and suppose that @xmath162 is the element we obtain by switching all @xmath1 s in @xmath161 to @xmath70 s , and all @xmath70 s to @xmath1 s , then @xmath163 , and the stationary probability @xmath164 of state @xmath161 occurring in our markov chain equals the corresponding probability for state @xmath162  that is , @xmath165 .",

    "the argument can be extended to circulant , in such a way that if the nodes corresponding to two indices @xmath161 and @xmath195 are adjacent , then any two nodes indexed by @xmath196 and @xmath197 are adjacent .",
