    "in recent years , systems of cold atoms have attracted interest of many condensed - matter physicists . in particular , cold atoms put on an optical lattice sometimes regarded as a  simulator \" to study canonical models of strongly correlated electron systems@xcite .",
    "these systems are quite controllable and impurity effects are suppressed .",
    "systems of single - species bosonic cold atoms are described by the standard bose - hubbard model@xcite , which explains the mott - superfluid phase transition . for two - component bosonic systems ,",
    "even the mott phase exhibits rich behavior@xcite . at total filling factor one and with strong inter and intra - species repulsive interactions , the two - component bose - hubbard model reduces to an effective spin model , i.e. heisenberg spin model@xcite , which has a nontrivial phase diagram .",
    "the experimental realization of bosonic mixture of @xmath0rb -@xmath1k in a three - dimensional optical lattice is an important development@xcite .",
    "the two - component bose - hubbard model at commensurate fillings has been studied in e.g. , refs.@xcite by the mean - field - theory ( mft ) type approximations and the numerical methods , and its one - dimensional counterpart by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory in ref.@xcite .",
    "phase diagrams of these systems were clarified .    from the view point of the strongly - correlated condensed matter physics , it is very interesting to study the two - component bose - hubbard model at _ fractional fillings and with strong repulsions_. then , we have started study of the bosonic t - j model@xcite , which is an effective model of the two - component bose - hubbard model at the above limit and is also a kind of bosonic counterpart of the t - j model for the high-@xmath2 superconducting phenomena@xcite .",
    "the bosonic t - j model ( b - t - j model ) describes two - component bosonic cold atoms in an optical lattice with strong inter and intra - species repulsions that can be controlled in the experiments .",
    "our previous studies on the b - t - j model mostly employed numerical monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations to clarify its phase diagram at finite temperature ( @xmath3)@xcite . in contrast to the fermionic t - j model , the numerical study can be done without any difficulties for some cases of the b - t - j model . in this paper",

    "we obtain phase diagram of the b - t - j model and verify the consistency of the results .",
    "furthermore we study low - energy excitations , i.e. , the nambu - goldstone bosons in various phases in the phase diagram . in sec.v , we numerically shall the b - t - j model in the stacked triangular lattice at finite @xmath3 .",

    "if @xmath192 in eq.([a0 ] ) , it is obvious that there exist three ng bosons .",
