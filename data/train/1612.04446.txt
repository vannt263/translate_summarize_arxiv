    "in the past years , there is an increasing interest in the study of non - equilibrium thermodynamics due to its relevance in the field of nano - technology and biology @xcite .",
    "one of the great challenges in the field of nano - technology is the design and construction of microscopic version of motor / devices that can perform directed motion using input energy and do some mechanical work . driving such directed motion is what protein motors ( a kind of brownian motor / molecular motor ) do over the course of years by evolution in every cell in living bodies @xcite .",
    "it has been realized that such unidirectional motion inside cell is possible only due to the presence of noise .",
    "noise is everywhere in nature and it plays a creative and stabilizing role in the dynamics of many nonequilibrium phenomena , e.g. , noise induced directed transport , stochastic resonance , noise induced phase transition , noise induced stability of unstable states , noise indued ordering @xcite etc . in the recent years , the phenomenon of `` noise induced directed transport '' is being studied extensively both in nano - physics and biology",
    ". the operating principle of brownian motors / brownian ratchets is based on the principle of noise induced directed transport @xcite .",
    "various kinds of brownian ratchet models like flashing ratchets , rocking ratchets , time - asymmetric ratchets , and inhomogeneous ratchets have been discussed based on the various ways of introducing the asymmetry in the ratchet system @xcite .",
    "the theoretical concept of noise induced transport in case of brownian motors / brownian ratchet models have been realized experimentally in a variety of systems .",
    "the examples include cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , colloidal particles in holographic optical trapping patterns , @xcite ratchet cellular automata @xcite etc .",
    "the most basic measure for characterizing the motion of transport in the case of a brownian motor or brownian ratchet model is it s average velocity in the long - time limit .",
    "this describes how much time a motor requires to overcome a given distance in the asymptotic regime . however , velocity is not only the measure for characterizing the nature of the transport .",
    "the other attributes are the quality and the effectiveness of transport .",
    "this is because , the noise induced transport in a motor is always acompained by a dispersive spread or diffusion .",
    "if the diffusive spread is very large compared to the distance covered by it , the quality of transport degrades and the transport becomes unreliable .",
    "similarly , in order to have an effective transport in a motor , one needs to look into the following questions : how much energy is input into the system ? , out of which how much is going to be converted into directed motion ? , and how much of it is spread out to the environment as dissipated heat ? .",
    "a proper quantifier for characterizing this aspect of transport is the efficiency of energy transduction \" .",
    "depending on the choice of the input and output energies in the performance of the motor , different definition of efficiency would characterize various aspects of energy conversion in its efficient operation . since brownian motor moves in a dissipative environment or highly viscous medium , a proper measure of efficiency in such viscously loaded motor",
    "is known as stokes efficiency , which can be viewed as a measure of how efficiently a motor can utilize the input energy to drive a certain distance against the acting viscous force . although , substantial progress have been done in the study of nature of currents and efficiency of transduction in various class of ratchet models @xcite , a few studies address the questions related to the quality or reliability of transport in ratchet models @xcite . in some of our recent studies @xcite ,",
    "it is observed that in a time asymmetric rocked ratchet model , the values of both the thermodynamic and stokes efficiency are quite large in a suitable parameter regime as compared to the previously studied ratchet models and hence the time asymmetric rocked ratchet model can be treated as an efficient brownian ratchet . however , the coherence or reliability of transport has not been reported so far in this particular ratchet model . in this study , we are mainly interested in the coherence or reliability of transport of an over damped brownian particle in a temporally asymmetric rocked ratchet model . the transport of a brownian particle in a ratchet model is said to be coherent or reliable , if the accompainig diffusion is much smaller than the distance covered by it .",
    "this , in turn , can be quantified by a dimensionless quantity , known as peclet number , @xmath0 which is defined as the ratio of the average velocity to the diffusion coefficient .",
    "originally , the concept of peclet number arises in the problems of heat transfer in hydrodynamics where it stands for the ratio of heat advection to diffusion .",
    "when the peclet number is small , the random motion dominates and when it is large the ordered and regular motion dominate .",
    "the value of the peclet number depends on some characteristic length scale of the system . while dealing the ratchet motion , the most adequate choice for such a length scale is the period of the ratchet .",
    "for example , if the particle in the ratchet on an average covers a distance , @xmath1 due to its finite average velocity , @xmath2 , the peclet number can be expressed as @xmath3 . in our model , we consider @xmath1 to be spatial periodicity of the ratchet potential .",
    "higher peclet number implies more coherence in the transport .",
    "in particular , quantitatively if the peclet number is larger than @xmath4 , the transport is said to be more coherent or reliable @xcite .",
    "the peclet number for some of the flashing and rocking ratchet model shows very low values , i.e. , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively resulting very low coherence in transport .",
    "however , in some of the studies it is found that a special kind of asymmetry helps in increasing the value of peclet number , i.e. , pe upto @xmath7 in a suitable regime of parameter space @xcite . the experimental observation in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that @xmath0 in case of biological motors ranges from @xmath4 to @xmath8 and these motors perform very efficiently as well as coherently inside living cells .",
    "the coherence in transport was also observed in various driven model systems @xcite . in a very recent study , it is shown that the characteristic performance of a ratchet can arise from the complex interplay between different characteristic time scales of the system @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we are mainly interested in a rocked ratchet model with a time asymmetric driving .",
    "enhannced thermodynamic efficiency and stokes efficiency were observed in this particular ratchet model in a suitable range of physical parameters @xcite . in the present study , we observe that in the deterministic limit , the larger spatial asymmetry in the potential enhances the coherence in transport , at the same time the temperature and driving frequency degrades the quality of transport .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follow . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce our model and the basic physical quantities of interest , namely , the average particle current , the effective difussion coefficient and the peclet number . in sec.iii ,",
    "we give the numerical simulation details of the model .",

    "this model has been studied in detail both in adiabatic and nonadiabatic limit @xcite . however , the main interest of those studies were on the efficient operation of the ratchet , hence the physical quantities of interest were different forms of efficiency of energy transduction .",
    "in this study we are mainly interested in the coherence of transport in the ratchet , therefore mainly on the diffusion coefficient , @xmath55 and the peclet number , @xmath0 . in the deterministic limit of the model ,",
    "i.e. , at temperature , @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath27 limit , there exists potential barriers in both forward as well as backward directions .",
    "the particle is basically in the locked state and randomly fluctuates across any one single minima of the ratchet for a finite temperature @xmath61 , resulting the average velocity to be zero so as the net current . in this limit , the net current can arise from the sum of the contributions from the fraction of current due to the forward forcing of the drive and the fraction of current due to the backward forcing . in the similar way we can evaluate the net diffusion coefficient as the sum of the contributions of diffusion from the forward direction ( when the forcing field is applied in the forward direction ) and from the backward directions ( when the forcing field is applied is in the backward direction ) respectively .",
    "the forward barriers to the motion of particle in the ratchet disappear only when the forcing amplitude in the forward direction is larger than the force exerted by the forward potential barrier , i.e. , when @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , the barriers in the backward direction disappear only when the backward forcing amplitude is larger than the force exerted by the potential barrier in the backward direction , i.e. , when @xmath63 .",
    "hence , two crictical forces , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , exist in the ratchet potential beyond which there are no barriers to motion of particle in both forward as well as backward direction . as a result there exists a finite positive current in the ratchet , only when the forcing amplitude is in between the crictical fields , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "( a ) , diffusion coefficient , @xmath49 ( b ) and the peclet number , @xmath0 as a function of amplitude of driving , @xmath50 for various values of the spatial asymmetry parameter , @xmath52 . the other fixed parameters are @xmath68 , @xmath53 and @xmath69.,width=288,height=240 ]    in fig.2 , we have plotted the average current,@xmath34 , diffusion coefficient , @xmath49 and the peclet number , @xmath0 as a function of amplitude of driving , @xmath50 for various values of the spatial asymmetry parameter , @xmath52 in the deterministic limit .",
    "@xmath70 refers to the free diffusion coefficient .",
    "we fix the other parameters of the model same as that where the ratchet shows an efficient performance ( resulting large values of both stokes efficiency and thermodynamic efficiency ) . for both symmetric as well as asymmetric potentials , both the average current , @xmath34 ( fig.1(a ) ) and @xmath71 ( fig.1(c ) ) show peaking behaviors as a function of amplitude of driving , @xmath50 . interestingly the peclet number , @xmath0 follows the same nature of the @xmath34 like the stokes efficiency and shows a maximum at the same value of forcing amplitude , @xmath50 , at which the average current , @xmath34 also show a maximum . for forcing amplitude , @xmath72 , there are potential barriers to the motion of particle in both the forward as well as backward direction and results a zero net current in the ratchet . in this limit ,",
    "the particle gets trapped in one of single well of the ratchet potential and randomly fluctuates across any one minima of the well and results a finite diffusion in the presence of a bias in either of the forward or backward direction .",
    "therefore the effective diffusion coefficient ( @xmath49 ) ( fig.1(b ) ) shows a finite positive value even at the zero value of amplitude of driving .",
    "this is due to the presence of a bias , i.e. , finite temperature ( @xmath51 ) in the ratchet . with further increase in amplitude of driving ,",
    "the forward barriers disappear at @xmath73 and the particle progresses more towards the forward direction without any back turn . as a result",
    "the average current , @xmath34 and @xmath0 increases with @xmath50 .",
    "however , at the same time the effective diffusion coefficient , @xmath49 decreases with @xmath50 .",
    "when the forcing amplitude , @xmath50 becomes @xmath74 , the potential barriers in the backward direction disappear and the particle starts moving in the backward direction , resulting a negative contribution towards the average current , @xmath34 .",
    "however , the diffusion in the backward direction increases . both the average current , @xmath34 and the peclet number shows a maximum at @xmath75 where as the diffusion coefficient @xmath49 passes through a minimum in the range of @xmath50 around @xmath76 , exactly where the peclet number shows a maximum , supporting a strong enhancement of transport coherence in this parameter regime . with increase in the spatial asymmetry ( @xmath52 ) in the ratchet potential ,",
    "both @xmath34 and @xmath0 increases and the maximum values shift towards the larger values of @xmath50 . at the same time",
    "the minimum values in the diffusion curve also shift towards right and shows a larger spreading for the values of @xmath50 in between @xmath77 and @xmath78 . for both symmetric as well as asymmetric ratchet potentials ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath49 saturates for larger @xmath50 values and is no more affected by the amplitude of driving .",
    "this is because , for larger @xmath50 values , the barriers in both the directions disappear , as a result the particle behaves like a free particle in the absence of any potential barrier .",
    "this is the case of a one dimensional free diffusion and @xmath79 .",
    "however , both the average current , @xmath34 and peclet number , @xmath0 approaches zero values in this limit . from fig.1(c ) , we noticed that the peclet number , @xmath0 is very high ( around @xmath80 ) for a larger spatial asymmetry parameter ( @xmath81 ) in the ratchet potential .",
    "we conclude that in this particular ratchet model , in the adiabatic regime of operation , i.e. , for low frequency of driving , the larger spatial asymmetry in the potential helps in enhancing the coherence of transport in the deterministic limit .    in fig.3 ,",

    "they show the similar behavior as a function of amplitude of driving as already seen in fig.2 .",
    "however , the peaks in both @xmath34 and @xmath0 as a function of @xmath50 as well as the minimum in @xmath49 curves get suppressed . at the same time",
    "the peaks in @xmath34 and @xmath0 get broader .",
    "this is because , larger temperature facilitates the escape of particle in the backward direction as well even in the presence of potential barriers .",
    "the particle spreads over both the forward as well as backward directions for a larger temperature resulting a decrease in the average current , @xmath34 and the peclet number , @xmath0 .    , the diffusion coefficient , @xmath49 and the peclet number , @xmath0 as a function of amplitude of driving , @xmath50 in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) respectively for a symmetric potential and for different values of temperature , @xmath59 , .",

    "we observe that , both @xmath34 and @xmath0 as a function of @xmath50 decrease with increase in temperature and the peak values both in @xmath34 ( fig.4(a ) ) and @xmath0 ( fig.4(c ) ) get suppressed and the peaks get broader .",
    "also the value of finite diffusion at zero amplitude of driving ( fig.4(b ) ) gets reduced . the crictical value of the ampitude of drive at which both the current and peclet number show a maximum , shift towards larger @xmath50 values with increase in temperature .",
    "similarly the minimum in the diffusion coefficient , @xmath49 as a function of @xmath50 curve , also shift towards right .",
    "this is due to the reason that , with increase in temperature , the thermal noise facilitates the progress of particle even in the backward direction , giving a negative contribution towards the average current , effective diffusion and in the peclet number . as a result",
    "effectively larger forces are required to overcome the barriers to the motion of the particle in the ratchet . in this parameter regime of ratchet operation",

    "the peak values both in @xmath34 as well as in @xmath71 curve decrease and at the same time the peaks shift towards larger @xmath50 values .",
    "this is because with increase in the frequency of drive , the forcing amplitude varies so fast that the particle is not able to take the advantage of force in either of the forward or backward directions and the motion of the particle towards the nearest neighbouring minima of the ratchet potential gets suppressed .",
    "this results a decrease in the average current as well as in the peclet number .",
    "the increase of frequency of driving degrades the coherence of transport in the ratchet . for a particular frequency of driving , the diffusion coefficient , @xmath49 as a function of @xmath50 ( fig.5(b ) )",
    "shows a decreasing behavior with @xmath50 .",
    "also the difussion coefficient , @xmath49 is very slightly affected or not at all affected by modulating the frequency drive .",
    "this is because for high frequency of drive , the forcing amplitude varies so fast that the particle does nt feel the influence the forcing .",
