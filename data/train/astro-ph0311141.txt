    "cosmological hydrodynamic simulations provide us with quantitative predictions for the state of baryonic matter in the universe ( see , e.g , @xcite ) . at high redshift ( @xmath2 ) , most baryons are diffuse , with a density close to the cosmic mean , and are located in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "they can be probed readily using ly@xmath3 absorption systems in the optical spectra of high redshift quasars ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . at low redshift ,",
    "the process of gravitational collapse has caused a minority of baryons to condense into structures such as stars , galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "while a substantial fraction ( @xmath4 30% ) of baryons are trapped within the gravitational potential wells of these large scale structures in the form of hot intracluster or intragroup gas , the remaining baryons are left in intergalactic space and are predicted to form filamentary structures seen in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "some of these structures contain baryons with relatively low temperatures ( @xmath5 k ) , and therefore enough residual neutral hydrogen to be detectable as the low - redshift ly@xmath3 forest ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a larger fraction have been shock - heated to temperatures between @xmath6 k. given these temperatures , these baryons , which form the so - called `` warm - hot intergalactic medium , '' or `` whim , '' are best probed using uv / x - ray observations .",
    "recently , important progress has been made in the detection of absorption features produced by highly ionized metals in this whim gas in the uv / x - ray spectra of background quasars . in the uv band ,",
    "a significant number of absorption lines have been seen with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( @xmath7 ) and the hubble space telescope ( @xmath8 ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution and derived properties of these lines are consistent with predictions from simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the x - ray band ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite reported on the detection of intervening and/or absorption lines with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite also reported the detection of @xmath9 x - ray absorption lines .",
    "these low redshift lines may be attributable , at least in part , to the whim gas in our local group .",
    "the absorption line method does have the advantage of directly probing the absorbing ions , as the detected line strength is proportional to the column density and so to the ion number density .",
    "however , it suffers the limitation of being only able to probe one dimensional information , along limited lines of sight , and detectability is also constrained by the flux of background sources . in order to fully reveal the three dimensional structure and physical properties of the whim gas",
    ", we need to study its _ emission _ with imaging / spectroscopic methods . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the x - ray emission from the whim gas .",
    "in general , x - ray emission from a hot , diffuse plasma contains two parts , a continuum which is contributed by various emission mechanisms , and line emission from metals in the igm .",
    "while we will briefly discuss the continuum emission from the whim , this paper will be devoted mostly to studying the line emission .",
    "several authors have extensively studied the broad band soft x - ray emission ( 0.5  2 kev ) from the diffuse background , particularly the x - ray emission from the whim gas , using hydrodynamical simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "much effort has been put into investigating the overall intensity of the emission , and how to distinguish it from the two dominant sources of the soft x - ray background : x - ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and from the hot gas in our galaxy ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "simulations predict that the mean intensity of emission from the whim gas is between ( 2  4 ) @xmath10 , only about 5  15% of the total extragalactic x - ray emission between 0.5  2 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "while it seems to be a difficult task to detect most of this whim emission with current x - ray telescopes , it appears feasible to detect the high intensity tail of the whim x - ray intensity distribution .",
    "for instance , @xcite reported on the presence of a possible filament with intensity @xmath11 with the _ rosat _ pspc ; and @xcite and @xcite reported detecting and/or from an extended , diffuse structure , possibly from whim gas ; and @xcite recently performed a large - field ( @xmath4 1 sr ) , high spectral resolution ( 5  12 ev ) observation with a sounding rocket and detected //",
    "lines from the diffuse background , some fraction of which may be from the whim at zero redshift .",
    "we expect that future x - ray missions will enable high resolution imaging / spectroscopic observations of the emission from the whim gas .",
    "we explore such a scenario with a high resolution hydrodynamic simulation in this paper .",
    "our purpose is to address two important questions : with high spectral / spatial resolution , what does the x - ray emission from the diffuse , hot gas in intergalactic space look like ; and are proposed future x - ray missions capable of conducting useful observations ?",
    "particularly , we will focus on a proposed mission called the missing baryon explorer , or @xmath1 . given its large field - of - view ( @xmath12 ) , high spectral ( @xmath13 ev ) and moderate angular ( @xmath14 ) resolution",
    ", we find that @xmath1 will be capable of revealing the x - ray emission from the whim gas .",
    "in addition , we will explore the clustering properties of the whim gas , and its correlation with nearby large scale structures traced by galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite examined the detectability of the x - ray emission from the whim gas independently with a similar numerical approach .",
    "they presented a detailed study of and emission lines from whim .",
    "they also investigated a dedicated x - ray mission , _ dios _ ( diffuse intergalactic oxygen surveyor ) .",
    "it turns out that _ dios _ and _ mbe _ very similar properties . while there are some differences between our work and theirs , such as the selection of the energy bands ( @xcite concentrated on 0.5  0.7 kev while we look at a broader band between 0.1  1 kev ) and the choice of the igm metallicity models , where they can be compared our results agree with each other reasonably well .",
    "our plan for this paper is as follows . we give a brief explanation of the simulation method and our treatment of the simulation data in  [ simu ] .",
    "a full study of the emission from the whim gas is presented in  [ soft ] , followed by measurement of its auto- and cross - correlation properties , making use of the galaxy distribution in the simulation for the latter .",
    "we investigate the detectability of emission with the proposed _",
    "x - ray telescope in  [ dete ] , and  [ disc ] is our discussion and summary .",
    "we use a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation studied by @xcite ( their model d1 ) .",
    "it was run with ptreesph , or parallel tree smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we refer the reader to these two papers as well as @xcite for more details .",

    "the simulation box size is @xmath20 with a @xmath21 spatial resolution ( comoving units , equivalent plummer softening ) .",
    "the baryonic mass resolution is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the solar mass .",
    "cooling from h and he was included , as well as star formation and mild feedback . as discussed in @xcite , the feedback consists of thermal energy which is released into star forming regions , which are of high density .",
    "the energy is rapidly radiated away and has little effect on the igm .",
    "the simulation was run from redshift @xmath24 to the present .",
    "we make use of 27 of the outputs , roughly logarithmically spaced in redshift , ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .    for each gas particle , we calculate the x - ray emissivity based on a raymond - smith code @xcite .",
    "note that we have first recalculated the sph densities for each x - ray emitting particle after excluding the cold particles from the density estimator ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this decoupling of hot and cold phases ( see also @xcite , for example ) is necessary in order avoid overestimating the densities of hot particles which are close to cold particles ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a density - dependent metallicity , @xmath27 , to mimic the density - metallicity relation obtained by @xcite , @xcite , and aguirre et al .",
    "( 2001a , b , c ) in their simulations .",
    "here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the density and the mean density of the universe .",
    "we normalize this relation by setting @xmath30 at @xmath31 to match ly@xmath3 forest measurements , and limiting the metallicity to be @xmath32 in much more overdense regions to match the observational results from galaxy clusters in the local universe . here",
    "@xmath33 is the solar abundance .",
    "the raymond - smith code includes eleven heavy elements , namely c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni . table  1 lists the wavelengths and the corresponding energies of the strongest emission lines we are probing with our simulation . assuming collisional ionization equilibrium , figure  [ f1 ] shows the emissivity @xmath34 for each ion species @xcite , where @xmath35 represents ion species @xmath36 . we give the strongest line ( the resonance line in the he - like triplet ) , and for we select the 825.79 ev line .    in figure  [ f2 ]",
    "we display three template x - ray emission spectra for hot gas at different temperatures : ( a ) t = @xmath37 k ; ( b ) t = @xmath38 k ; ( c ) t = @xmath39 k. we use a metallicity of 0.1 @xmath33 , which is typical for gas with overdensities @xmath40 a few hundred based on simulations ( @xcite , @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ f2]a and  [ f2]b show that at low temperatures the spectra are dominated by c , n and emission lines . at high temperatures and fe emission",
    "start to take over . at temperatures above @xmath39",
    "k , the spectra are completely dominated by fe and ne emission lines .     ",
    "@xmath39 k. emission models were taken from @xcite . ]",
    "three types of continuum emission make contributions to the total x - ray continuum we discuss here : thermal bremsstrahlung radiation , or free - free emission ; radiative recombination radiation , or free - bound emission ; and two - photon decay ( see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "their relative contributions vary with temperature and photon energy .",
    "for instance , at t @xmath43 k radiative recombination dominates at e @xmath44 kev , while thermal bremsstrahlung radiation dominates over the entire x - ray band when t @xmath45 k. the total continuum emissivity @xmath46 , as a function of photon energy @xmath47 , can be written as @xcite :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the gas temperature , @xmath50 is the electron density , @xmath51 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath52 is the total effective gaunt factor , which includes all three continuum emission processes @xcite . by integrating @xmath53 over energy @xmath47 ,",
    "the integrated x - ray continuum emissivity is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 for high temperature gas , in which bremsstrahlung radiation dominates , and @xmath56 for gas with @xmath57 a few @xmath58 k.",
    "in order to go from the three dimensional particle distributions in the simulation outputs to sky maps and spectra , we rely on the technique of stacking simulation boxes along the lightcone ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we place simulation boxes one behind the other until we reach the comoving distance corresponding to a given redshift ( @xmath59 in the first case ) .",
    "the output file corresponding to the closest redshift is used at each point ( we use 11 different outputs between @xmath26 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "the boxes are randomly rotated , reflected and translated @xcite so that periodic structure does not repeat along the line of sight .",
    "because of this , only structure on scales smaller than the box is preserved , and we only consider structure on these scales when measuring clustering statistics .",
    "for example , the median redshift of emission is @xmath60 in the @xmath61 kev band , so that we can not accurately simulate structure with angular scales @xmath62 100 arcmins .",
    "the x - ray emissivity in a range of 2ev wide bins in energy is computed for each particle , and these quantities are allocated to a grid using the projection of the sph kernel on the plane of the sky ( see below for more details ) . the grid is a three dimensional datacube , with two angular axes and one axis for photon energy .",
    "we first examine the angular distribution of the emission in a relatively broad spectral band . in figure  [ f3 ]",
    "we show a map of a @xmath63 simulated region . the area has been divided into a 512@xmath64512 grid , so that each pixel has side length @xmath65 .",
    "the x - ray emission includes both continuum and metal line emission from the hot igm , integrated between 0.1  1 kev .",
    "@xcite showed that the majority of the x - ray emission from the igm received at @xmath26 comes from gas with @xmath66 ( about 90% , see figure  11a of @xcite ) . due to dilution by projection , filaments that would be apparent in three dimensions",
    "do not appear readily here .",
    "the intensity varies from @xmath67 , in patches of sky dominated by emission from the hot igm in groups or clusters of galaxies , down to @xmath68 , in regions of low density .",
    "we label three ( @xmath69 ) areas that we will study in detail spectroscopically in the following sections : area ( a ) , with an average surface brightness of @xmath70 , representing x - ray emission from a galaxy group ; area ( b ) , with a mean surface brightness of @xmath71 , representing x - ray emission from a superposition of filamentary structures ; and area ( c ) , with a surface brightness of @xmath72 , an underdense and void - like region .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] shows the soft x - ray emission from the same sky area but in four narrower energy bands .",
    "since the x - ray continuum emissivity exponentially decreases with energy , in most energy intervals the flux from the x - ray emission lines dominates over the continuum emission . in panel",
    "( a ) emission lines from carbon , particularly and triplet dominate from 250 to 350 ev . here",
    "we assume that most x - ray emission lines come from the low - redshift igm .",
    "@xcite showed that x - ray emission from the igm peaks at @xmath73 and decreases slowly to high redshift .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the band ( 350  425 ev ) in which nitrogen lines dominate .",
    "panel ( c ) is for the band ( 550  600 ev ) for which oxygen lines dominate ( mainly triplet ) .",
    "panel ( d ) , the highest energy is in the band where emission from iron is very strong , mainly the fe l complex .",
    "it can be clearly seen from the emission maps in these four narrower energy bands that low energy emission is rather more diffuse ( panels a and b ) than high energy emission , as would be expected from a superposition of filamentary structures . on the other hand , at high energy emission",
    "comes from more obviously discrete sources , such as collapsed regions which form groups of galaxies .",
    "to study the spectroscopic properties of the soft x - ray emission from the whim gas , we divide the simulated patch of sky into @xmath74 grid cells , with each cell extending over an area of @xmath69 .",
    "is the spatial resolution of the missing baryon explorer ( _ mbe _ ) , a proposed x - ray mission which we will discuss later . ] in every cell , we obtain the x - ray spectrum of each gas particle by applying the raymond - smith code , based on its temperature , density , metallicity and redshift .",
    "the peculiar velocities of the gas particles are used in order to produce a redshift space spectrum .",
    "we then combine all the spectra to obtain a synthesized spectrum in each cell , as mentioned above .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] shows 10 random samples of such spectra picked from the brightest 10 % of pixels over the range 0.30.9 kev .",
    "a large number of emission lines are visible in many of the panels .",
    "having information from the underlying simulation allows us to identify lines easily .",
    "our scheme for doing this automatically is as follows . when creating the spectra , for each energy bin , we keep track of the redshift of the particle that was the largest contributor of x - ray flux to that bin . when plotting the spectra , we divide the energy of bin @xmath35 by @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the redshift of the maximum flux particle .",
    "if the resulting value is within 5 ev of one of the known ion rest wavelengths ( see table 1 ) , and the pixel corresponds to a peak in the spectrum , we label it with the name of ion species , and the redshift @xmath76 . it can be seen that many of the features come from the same redshift , but are signposted by different species .",
    "for example , the top left panel shows that a number of lines ( , , and ) arise from hot gas at redshift @xmath77 .",
    "these types of spectra can potentially provide us with important information that could help us identify emission lines with ion species and redshifts in real observations .",
    "( @xcite ) and other x - ray missions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) show that the soft x - ray background in the band 0.1 - 1 kev is comprised of at least three components : ( 1 ) unabsorbed x - ray emission , referred to as the `` local hot bubble '' ( lhb ) , from a cavity in the local interstellar medium ( @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) hotter absorbed x - rays , referred to as `` transabsorption emission '' ( tae , @xcite ) , from gas in either the galactic halo or the intragroup medium of the local group ( @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) an extragalactic x - ray background ( @xcite ) .",
    "simultaneous fits to asca and rosat data arrive at the same components @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the extragalactic x - ray background is dominated by discrete sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "_ rosat _ deep surveys resolved @xmath470  80% of the soft x - ray background ( 0.5  2 kev ) into discrete sources at a flux limit of @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "deep survey , which had a flux limit of @xmath79 , resolved an additional 6  13% into point sources @xcite .",
    "this leaves room for @xmath45 ",
    "25% to come from diffuse emission from hot gas in the igm , which is what we concentrate on in this paper .    to obtain the composite spectrum of the galactic foreground and the agn background , we use the following simple models of the components .",
    "( 1 ) for the lhb , we adopt a thermal plasma model with k@xmath80 kev and emission measure @xmath81 pc .",
    "the metal abundance is taken to be solar , except for mg , si , and fe , which have an abundance of 0.28 @xmath33 .",
    "( 2 ) for the tae , we adopt a thermal plasma model with k@xmath82 kev and emission measure @xmath83 pc .",
    "this model has solar abundances and is absorbed by a hydrogen column density of @xmath84 .",
    "the parameters for these two thermal components were obtained from fits to the calorimeter sounding rocket data reported in @xcite using the mekal spectral models in xspec  .",
    "( 3 ) the third component represents the agn .",
    "we used a spectrum constructed by d. mccammon ( private communication ) to reflect all the known rosat and chandra data on the resolved agn contribution of the soft x - ray background ( see figure 15 , @xcite ) . in figure 6",
    "we show the composite spectrum of these three components .",
    "we select three regions ( shown as white boxes in figure  [ f3 ] ) to study three typical types of x - ray emission : ( a ) hot gas in a galaxy group ( figure  [ f7]a ) ; ( b ) diffuse x - ray emission in a filament ( figure  [ f7]b ) ; and ( c ) a void ( figure  [ f7]c ) . in each panel",
    "we show three curves : the red line is the emission from the igm , green is the composite spectrum of agns and the galactic foreground , and the black line represents the total emission .",
    "we also identify the most significant igm emission lines with their ion species and redshifts in a similar fashion to figure  [ f5 ] .        in figure",
    "[ f7]a it is clear that the igm emission dominates the entire spectrum .",
    "this is not surprising because the x - rays come from the hot gas within a galaxy group at redshift @xmath85 .",
    "for such hot gas , bremsstrahlung radiation , which dominates the total x - ray emissivity , is @xmath86 , where @xmath50 is the electron density and @xmath49 is the temperature . the x - ray emission from the high density and high temperature intragroup medium shows a strong continuum , and this dominates over the agn and galactic foreground emission . in this panel",
    "we identify emission lines from o , fe , and ne .",
    "in particular we can easily make out redshifted ly@xmath3 ( resonance line at 611 ev ) and the triplet ( forbidden line at 524 ev , intercombination line at 531 ev , and resonance line at 536 ev ) .",
    "this could provide us with a direct measurement of the temperature , electron density and ionization states of this x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the numerous lines between 650  850 ev are mainly emission lines from fe l - shell transitions , and many of these lines belong to transitions .    figure  [ f7]b shows the emission spectrum of a patch of sky covered with more diffuse structures , known to be filamentary in 3 dimensions [ area ( b ) in figure  [ f3 ] ] .",
    "the total spectrum ( black line ) is dominated by the background ( agns ) and foreground emission , especially at e @xmath87 kev .",
    "however , we see several emission lines from a filament crossing the line of sight at @xmath88 .",
    "although the overall continuum level is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of the agns plus the foreground , these emission lines are strong enough to poke through the total spectrum and show up as obvious features .    in figure  [ f7]c the total spectrum",
    "is completely dominated by the agns plus the foreground .",
    "the emission from the igm is almost 100 times lower that that of the agns plus the foreground , and it is not possible to detect any signals from the igm .    in figure",
    "[ f8 ] and  [ f9 ] we zoom in on areas ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , plotting only emission from gas which lies within particular narrow range in redshift ( explained below ) .",
    "these plots have angular resolution four times higher than that in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "figure  [ f8 ] shows a simulated @xmath89 region , centered on area ( a ) ( denoted by the white box ) .",
    "most x - ray emission lines from this area originate from hot gas at @xmath90 , so that we have cut out a slice that is centered on this redshift with @xmath91 ( about 1.5 comoving @xmath92 ) .",
    "figure  [ f8 ] shows the x - ray emission from this slice , and the dotted lines show contours of x - ray emission . in similar fashion",
    "we have made figure  [ f9 ] for area ( b ) .",
    "clearly , the round shape of the x - ray contours in figure  [ f8 ] indicates that the hot gas in area ( a ) sits in a virialized , relatively stable system , such as a galaxy group .",
    "the x - ray contours in area ( b ) ( figure  [ f9 ] ) ( we are plotting only emission coming from close to @xmath93 ) show rather more diffuse and irregular x - ray emission from filamentary structures .    to further understand the gas distribution within area ( a ) and ( b ) , we examine all the particles in these two areas centered around redshifts of @xmath4 0.775 and 0.21 , respectively . the length along the line of sight correspond to 5@xmath94 at that redshift , i.e. , two cubes with comoving sizes @xmath95 at @xmath96 and @xmath97 at @xmath93 . in figure  [ f10 ]",
    "we plot the temperature vs. overdensity of gas particles with @xmath98 k. red filled circles represents particles in area ( a ) , and black ones are from area ( b ) . in area ( a ) ,",
    "most particles concentrate on a region with overdensities around @xmath99 , while in area ( b ) gas particles distribute more diffusely .",
    "the confirms our initial guess that particles in area ( a ) are more concentrated and tend to form a virialized structure , and in area ( b ) structure is more filamentary - like .",
    "clearly , an important method to distinguish between area ( a ) and ( b ) is to study the emission line strength via , i.e. , figure  [ f7 ] .",
    "but exactly how does the observed line strength vary with gas density ? to understand this , we select line at 654 ev as a representative line and study the line flux in each of the @xmath100 grid .",
    "again we select all the grids around the two redshifts , 0.0775 and 0.21 , to calculate the flux from each cube .",
    "the total flux of emission line from one cube can be obtained by direct summarization of the line flux from each individual particle in that cube @xcite .",
    "the mean density of that cube is calculated by averaging the total mass of particles with @xmath98 k within that cube .",

    "two circles pointed by arrows are area ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "while the line flux dependency on gas density is a complicated relation because it involves properties like temperature , ionization structure and metallicity , in general figure  [ f11 ] shows that high density regions tend to have high fluxes .",

    "it is apparent , from equation  ( [ ew ] ) , that an instrument with high @xmath157 is needed to detect weak emission features .",

    ", we assume that the desired s / n ratio is 3 , that the line has energy 0.6 kev ( where most o and fe lines lie ) , and that the exposure time is 200 ksec .",

    "when a telescope with a field of view , @xmath161 , maps a region with solid angle , @xmath156 , with a total exposure time , t , each point of the region receives a exposure time of @xmath162 , so the minimum ew in each pixel can be expressed as :    @xmath163    to compare the minimum detectable @xmath158 among the four instruments , we use as the value for @xmath160 the largest instrument pixel size ( @xmath164 from mbe ) , and for @xmath156 we take the largest instrument field of view ( @xmath165 from mbe ) . in the case of the same @xmath156 ,",

    "we have presented a detailed study of predictions for the soft x - ray emission from the warm - hot intergalactic medium .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have examined images of soft x - ray emission from the hot igm with a wide field of view ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "having spectral information for each pixel allowed us to view the sky in several different soft x - ray energy bands , where emission lines from different ion species dominate .",
    "the low energy emission is markedly more diffuse than x - rays in the higher bands . 2 .",
    "we selected three representative simulated patches of sky to study with high resolution x - ray spectra : ( a ) a galaxy group ; ( b ) a filament ; ( c ) a void - like , underluminous region . in each case , we saw numerous emission lines from elements such as c , n , o , fe , ne , and identified their redshifts .",
    "3 .   by taking into account the background x - ray emission from the agns and foreground emission from the galaxy , we obtained composite x - ray spectra of the selected regions .",
    "we found that in areas where the galaxy group is present , the x - ray spectrum is dominated by the hot intragroup medium , while in the void - like areas , the spectrum is completely dominated by the agns plus the galactic foreground . in the filament case , although the majority emission comes from the agns plus the galactic foreground , it is still possible to detect strong emission lines from the whim .",
    "we found that the emission in the ( 0.5 - 0.8 kev ) band ( covering many of the emission lines ) shows strong small scale angular clustering , as measured by the angular autocorrelation function .",
    "also , spectral information for each pixel allowed us to measure three dimensional clustering .",
    "in particular , we computed the cross - correlation between eight different ion species and the simulated galaxy distribution .",
    "we found that showed the strongest correlation signal , being measurable on scales as large as @xmath182 mpc , while low energy species such as and showed no correlation at all .",
    "this variation of the correlation strengths can be explained by ( @xmath183 ) , the combination of line emissivity @xmath34 and elemental abundance @xmath142 : the larger ( @xmath183 ) , the stronger the correlation signal . 5 .",
    "finally , we studied the detectability of the whim with several proposed x - ray missions . by comparing the effective area ,",
    "resolving power and instrumental field - of - view , we found that the missing baryon explorer ( @xmath1 ) shows the most promise for detecting weak emission lines from the whim gas .",
    "we also showed simulated mbe instrument - folded spectra of our three selected patches of sky .",
    "accurate prediction of the soft x - ray emission depends on several important factors , including x - ray emissivity , ionization fraction , metal abundances , etc .",
    "the largest uncertainty in our predictions of the soft x - ray emission comes from the metal abundance in the igm .",
    "theoretically , simulations are beginning to address the formation and distribution of metals in a self consistent way ( see e.g. , @xcite ; aguirre et al . 2001a , b , c ) .",
    "the metallicity - density relationship we adopted in this paper was motivated by this work , and future studies of uv and soft x - ray emission lines should examine the question of metal enrichment in more detail ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , metals are known to be distributed in a variety of systems with large dispersion in metallicity @xmath184 . for example , the metallicity can be as high as @xmath185 in the central regions of some active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( @xcite ) , and as low as @xmath186 in some halo stars in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "when we focus on the low redshift igm , the main evidence for an enriched igm comes from the observations of the x - ray - emitting gas within galaxy clusters ( @xcite ) . with _ asca _ , @xcite found that the metallicities in four clusters vary between @xmath187 . studying @xmath188 clusters at @xmath189",
    ", @xcite concluded that there is no metallicity evolution in clusters up to @xmath190 .",
    "the observations of the ly@xmath3 systems at low redshifts give metallicities as high as @xmath191 @xcite indicating a metal enrichment in even lower density systems at low redshifts .",
    "the observations of damped ly@xmath3 systems [ n ( ) @xmath192 show a similar result @xcite . due to the lack of observations ,",
    "the metallicity of the `` whim '' is unknown .",
    "another uncertainty comes from the sensitive dependence of the x - ray emissivity and ionization fraction on physical properties of the whim gas , such as its temperature and density .",
    "for instance , both the emissivity and ionization fraction peak over a rather narrow range of temperatures , and drop rapidly at low and high temperatures ( see figure  [ f1 ] and figure 2 , 3 , & 4 of @xcite ) , which means a small change in temperature will cause order - of - magnitude changes in both quantities .",
    "this will in turn cause a dramatic change in observables such as intensity and emission line ion species . because of this the actual observed spectrum depends sensitively on the underlying physical properties of the whim gas .    in this paper",
    ", we adopted several approximations to simply the calculations .",
    "first we did not take into account photoionization ",
    "we used collisional ionization when calculating the ionization fractions .",
    "it is important to be aware that photoionization from background radiation may substantially alter the metal ionization fractions for low density , low temperature gas ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which in turn will change the observed spectrum .",
    "however , since most of the emission spectra that can be observed with _",
    "mbe _ or other telescopes are produced by hot gas in the high density , high temperature tail of the whim distribution , where collisional ionization dominates , we expect that photoionization will not substantially change those observables .    metal cooling is ignored in our simulation : the cooling is primarily through h and he .",
    "metal line cooling could be very important in some cases , especially for high density , warm / hot gas ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , since our results are very sensitive to the temperature variation , it is important to quantify the possible effect of metal cooling on whim gas temperature . to cool some hot gas ,",
    "giving it a small drop in temperature @xmath193 , the characteristic time scale @xmath194 is @xmath195 here @xmath3 is @xmath196 or @xmath197 , depending on whether the cooling is isochoric or isobaric ; @xmath51 is boltzmann s constant ; @xmath198 is the electron density ; and @xmath199 is the cooling function . assuming that we are interested in how cooling acts on timescale of order the hubble time , we can estimate the effect of metal cooling on the temperature decrement @xmath193 in terms of the physical parameters of the whim gas : @xmath200 where @xmath201 ; @xmath202 ; @xmath203 is the cooling time in units of hubble time scale . here",
    "@xmath204 is cooling rate in units of @xmath205 , typical of the whim gas with 0.1 solar abundance @xcite .",
    "so in general , metal cooling has only a minor effect on our results ; however , since @xmath206 in the temperature range we are interested in , the metal cooling process is more efficient for low temperature gas , especially so when @xmath207 reaches its peak at @xmath208 k.    it has been known for quite some time that non - gravitational heating , and/or cooling processes can change the overall level of cosmological x - ray emission substantially ( @xcite ) .",
    "the energy deposited by supernovae in our simulations has little direct effect on the igm .",
    "it is added as thermal energy to particles in high density regions and is radiated away quickly .",
    "although the direct impact of feedback is therefore minimal , the cooling included serves to change the entropy distribution of gas near the centers of virialized objects and lower the overall level of emission .",
    "other treatments of starburst energy such as those which involve giving wind particles kinetic energy so that they escape beyond galaxy and group virial radii into the igm ( e.g. , @xcite ) are also likely to change the distribution of x - ray emitting gas .",
    "different treatments of feedback have been shown by @xcite and @xcite to change the pdf of x - ray surface brightnesses in the range which would affect the whim emission lines we focus on here .",
    "varying the feedback model would be useful in the future in order to assess the range of effects on the whim emission .    finally , the ionization state of the gas was calculated assuming ionization equilibrium .",
    "non - equilibrium evolution of the ionization state can significantly change the ionization fraction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic time scale for hot gas to reach ionization equilibrium , or the recombination time scale is @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the recombination rate . at a temperature of @xmath43",
    "k , the recombination rate for , for example , is @xmath211 @xcite . here we include contributions from both radiative and dielectronic recombination . assuming @xmath212 , typical of whim gas , the recombination time scale is @xmath4 2 gyrs , less than the hubble time .",
    "however , we must keep in mind that most of the hot gas was shock - heated at low redshift , so it is very likely that a significant portion of the whim gas has not reached its recombination time scale and is in a non - equilibrium ionization state .    a reasonable question to ask",
    "is : given detected x - ray emission lines , how do we identify lines with ion species and redshifts ? it is impossible to carry out line identification with a single line ; however , by simultaneously observing multiple lines such as the triplet and/or redshifted to the same degree , which is within the capability of the energy resolution of proposed x - ray missions such as _ mbe _ , we can easily identify lines with redshifts .",
    "in addition , measurements of the line ratios can provide direct temperature / density diagnostics for the ionized plasma ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations of soft x - ray emission lines have the potential to not only reveal the presence of the missing baryons but to give us detailed information on their clustering , temperature , and metallicity .",
    "x - ray emission provides a direct probe of the whim gas . unlike the x - ray absorption method , which can yield only one dimensional information , by combining imaging / spectroscopic observations ,",
    "x - ray emission can show us the fully three - dimension distribution of the whim gas .",
    "this is essential not only for closure of the local cosmic baryon budget , but also if we are to understand the distribution of the whim gas , and how structures form and evolve .",
    "moreover , by applying line diagnostic methods , x - ray emission lines can be used to probe the metallicity , temperature and density of x - ray emitting gas .",
    "this in turn can give us important information on galaxy formation and evolution , given that most of these metals which are responsible for x - ray emission lines are produced by supernova explosions and propagate from the interstellar medium into intergalactic medium .",
    "although the relatively low density and temperature make it hard to observe , currently proposed x - ray missions will for the first time provide us with detectable signals from the x - ray emission of the whim gas .",
