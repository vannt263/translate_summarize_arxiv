    "the standard model of particle physics has been phenomenologically the most successful low energy effective theory for the last few decades .",
    "the predictions of standard model have been verified experimentally with a very high accuracy except the missing higgs boson . despite its phenomenological succcess , we all now know that this model neither address many theoretical issues like gauge hiererchy problem , nor provides a complete understanding of various observed phenomena like non - zero neutrino masses , dark matter etc .",
    "a great deal of works have been done so far on various possible extensions of the standard model , although non of them can be called a complete phenomenological model .",
    "such extensions generally involve incorporating some extra symmetries into the standard model .",
    "these symmetries may be an extra gauge symmetry like in left - right symmetric model @xcite , grand unified theories ( gut ) @xcite etc .",
    "another highly motivating symmetry is supersymmetry , the symmetry between bosons and fermions .",
    "the inclusion of supersymmetry into the standard model ( mssm ) has many advantages among which stabilizing the higgs mass against the radiative corrections , providing a cold dark matter candidate ( which can be made stable by incorporating r - pariy ) , making the gauge coupling constants unify at high energy are significantly important .",
    "one very non - conventional extension of the standard model is to go beyond three generations of quarks and leptons @xcite .",
    "although the number of light neutrinos are constrained to three from big bang nucleosynthesis(bbn ) as well as precision measurement of z boson decay width , there is absolutely nothing which prevents us from adding a heavy fourth generation with the corresponding fourth neutrino heavier than @xmath2 .",
    "similar lower bounds will exists for charged fermions also @xcite .",
    "we know that the smallness of three standard model neutrino masses @xcite can be naturally explained via see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "after incorporating a fourth generation neutrino into the standard model ( sm4 ) , the seesaw mechanism should be such that it gives three light and one very heavy neutrinos .",
    "such analysis within the context of sm4 were done in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the idea of introducing a separate higgs with larger vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to account for the heavier fermion masses such as top quark mass @xcite or fourth generation fermion masses @xcite , here also we propose a model with an extended higgs sector and a fourth chiral family of quarks and leptons .",
    "however , our model differs from the earlier models in the sense that we incorporate an additional abelian gauge sector which couples to the first three generations differently than it does to the fourth generation fermions .",
    "such non - universal gauge couplings automatically forces one to have at least two different higgs doublets to give masses to the fermions . in our model , majorana neutrino masses of first three generation arise after spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking whereas the fourth generation neutrino turns out to be a dirac neutrino .",
    "we also point out that our model reproduces the higgs - fermion structure considered by the authors in @xcite . due to the existence of a heavy higgs doublet which couples only to the fourth generation fermions and a lighter higgs which couples only to the first three generations",
    ", our model can evade the lhc exclusion range @xmath0 placed within the context of generic sm4 @xcite .",
    "the fourth generation dirac neutrino can be long lived in this minimal model if we set the off diagonal yukawa couplings between first three generations and and the fourth generation to zero .",
    "we further show that the a long lived heavy dirac fourth generation neutrino can contribute upto @xmath1 of the total dark matter in the universe .",
    "fourth generation chiral fermions can have many other interesting phenomenological consequences , for example in rare b and k decays @xcite .",
    "it can also account for like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry observed by d0 recently @xcite as was discussed in @xcite .",
    "however here we restrict ourselves to the issue of neutrino mass and dark matter only .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section [ sec1 ]",
    "we discuss the @xmath3 extended standard model with four generations , discuss the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking and neutrino mass .",
    "we briefly comment on the fourth generation and lhc higgs search in section [ 4thlhc ] . in section [ 4thdm ]",
    "we calculate the relic abundance of a stable fourth generation dirac neutrino within the @xmath3 model framework and then conclude in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "abelian gauge extension of standard model is one of the best motivating examples of beyond standard model physics . for a review see @xcite .",
    "such a model is also motivated within the framework of gut models , for example @xmath4 . the supersymmetric version of such models have an additional advantage in the sense that they provide a solution to the mssm @xmath5 problem .",
    "here we consider an extension of the standard model gauge group with one abelian @xmath3 gauge symmetry .",
    "thus the model we are going to work on is an @xmath6 gauge theory with four chiral generations .",
    "we will consider family non universal @xmath3 couplings such that the first three generations and the fourth generation have different charges under @xmath3 . since the coupling is universal in the first three generations and we set the off diagonal yukawa couplings between first three generation and the fourth generation to zero in this minimal model there will not be any severe constraints from flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) limits . as it will be clear later",
    ", our purpose of choosing such non universal couplings is to allow majorana mass terms for the first three generation right handed neutrinos only and not for the fourth generation right handed neutrino .",
    "the fermion content of our model is @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 goes over the three generations of standard model and the numbers in the bracket correspond to the quantum number under the gauge group @xmath6 .",
    "similarly the fourth generation fermions are @xmath10 @xmath11 the quantum numbers of the fermions under the new gauge symmetry @xmath3 should satisfy the following anomaly cancellation conditions : @xmath12 ^ 2u(1)_x : 3(2n_1-n_2-n_3)+(2n_8-n_9-n_{10 } ) = 0\\ ] ] @xmath13 ^ 2u(1)_x : 3(\\frac{3n_1}{2}+\\frac{n_4}{2})+(\\frac{3n_8}{2}+\\frac{n_{11}}{2})=0\\ ] ] @xmath14 ^ 2u(1)_x : 3(\\frac{n_1}{6}-\\frac{4n_2}{3}-\\frac{n_3}{3}+\\frac{n_4}{2}-n_5)+(\\frac{n_8}{6}-\\frac{4n_{10}}{3}-\\frac{n_9}{3}+\\frac{n_{11}}{2}-n_{12})\\ ] ] @xmath15 ^ 2 : 3(n^2_1 - 2n^2_2+n^2_3-n^2_4+n^2_5)+(n^2_8 - 2n^2_{10}+n^2_9-n^2_{11}+n^2_{12})=0\\ ] ] @xmath16 ^ 3 : 3(6n^3_1 - 3n^3_2 - 3n^3_3 + 2n^3_4-n^3_5 ) + ( 6n^3_8 - 3n^3_{10}-3n^3_9 + 2n^3_{11}-n^3_{12})-3n^3_6-n^3_{13}=0\\ ] ] @xmath17 we consider one possible solution to the above anomaly matching conditions which allows us to choose a minimal scalar sector for our purposes : @xmath18 here we are interested in a solution where @xmath19 .      for the particular solution of the anomaly matching conditions mentioned in the previous subsection , the higgs fields required to give rise to the fermion dirac masses are @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 gives rise to the first three generation dirac masses and the latter gives rise to the fourth generation dirac masses . since the higgs scalars do not contribute to the anomalies we can choose their representation under the gauge group independent of the above anomaly matching conditions . since @xmath23 , it is clear that the majorana mass term for the fourth generation singlet neutrino is not allowed in the lagrangian although the same is allowed for the first three generations if we include one more higgs @xmath24 whose vev will give rise to the majorana mass term of the first three generation neutrinos .",
    "this singlet higgs field also plays a crucial role in the gauge symmetry breaking resulting in a heavy @xmath3 boson .",
    "it also keeps the scale of @xmath3 symmetry breaking higher than the electroweak symmetry breaking . due to the absence of majorana mass term of fourth generation neutrino",
    ", we arrive at three light ( @xmath25 ) standard model majorana neutrinos and one dirac neutrino .",
    "this is exactly what we want : a fourth generation dirac neutrino whose mass can be easily adjusted to lie above the experimental lower bounds .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian is @xmath26 @xmath27 let @xmath28 . for the minimal version of our model",
    ", we set the off diagonal yukawa couplings between first three generations and the fourth generation to zero that is , @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "thus the first three generation right handed neutrino acquire majorana neutrino mass proportional to @xmath31 whereas the fourth generation right handed neutrino does not acquire any majorana mass . hence the first three generation",
    "neutrino mass arise from seesaw mechanism whereas the fourth generation neutrino is a dirac neutrino due to the absence of corresponding majorana mass term . under the assumption that the off diagonal yukawa couplings between first three and the fourth generation are zero , the fourth generation neutrino can be a long lived particle and",
    "hence can play a non - trivial role in cosmology .",
    "we pursue this study in the next section in the context of dark matter .",
    "it may be noted that , choosing a non - minimal solution to the anomaly matching conditions and hence an extended higgs sector , the off diagonal yukawa couplings can naturally be set to zero .",
    "the gauge boson masses will come from the kinetic terms of the higgs fields . denoting the @xmath32 gauge fields as @xmath33 respectively",
    ", we write the neutral gauge boson mass matrix in the @xmath34 basis as @xmath35 the off - diagonal elements of the above mass matrix indicate non - zero mixings between the standard model gauge bosons and the @xmath3 boson .",
    "the non - zero mixing arise since the doublet higgs fields @xmath36 are charged under both the standard model gauge group as well as the extra @xmath3 . however these mixing have to be very small so as not to be in conflict with the electroweak precision measurements .",
    "the simplest way to evade all these restrictions is to consider zero mixings which can be achieved simply by the following constraint : @xmath37 the charged @xmath38 boson mass is @xmath39 . using this and the above constraint we get @xmath40 @xmath41 here we restrict our discussion to this simple situation of no - mixing with the extra @xmath3 boson .",
    "thus the first three generation neutrino mass comes from the usual type i seesaw formula @xmath42 and the fourth generation neutrino has a dirac mass @xmath43 .",
    "the lower bounds on the fourth generation charged fermion masses @xcite are @xmath44 which can be satisfied by suitable choice of yukawa couplings .",
    "the requirement of perturbativity of yukawa couplings @xmath45 at the electroweak scale restricts the vev of @xmath46 to be at most @xmath47 and hence @xmath48 in this particular model , we assume that the fourth generation fermions have no mixing with the first three generations at tree level and hence the fourth generation neutrino ( if lighter than the corresponding charged fermion ) can be stable or long - lived and hence may play a role as dark matter .",
    "we do the analysis of relic density of such a stable heavy neutrino in the next section .",
    "for the last one year , lhc has been producing large number of data sets to confirm many of the already established facts as well as to rule out a lot of parameter space for many beyond standard model frameworks . for standard model with four generations , cms has ruled out the higgs boson mass in the range of @xmath49 at @xmath50 c.l @xcite .",
    "some considerations on the implications of a fourth generation that may evade this bound have appeared recently in @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to reduce the tension between higgs searches at the lhc and a heavy fourth generation by extending the scalar sector of the standard model .",
    "the lhc exclusion range @xmath0 @xcite corresponds to the process @xmath51 where @xmath52 can be either @xmath53 or @xmath54 bosons .",
    "the authors of @xcite considered two higgs doublets @xmath36 with the first one coupling to the first three generations and the second one coupling to the fourth generation only . choosing the higgs mixing angle @xmath55 to be same as @xmath56 makes the coupling of one of the higgs mass eigenstates to the vector boson zero and",
    "hence can be light without conflicting with the lhc exclusion range coming from the @xmath51 process .",
    "the other higgs which couple to vector bosons can be as heavy as the generic unitarity bound for two higgs doublet models @xmath57 @xcite , such a higgs can still be outside the lhc search range .",
    "our model has a different motivation and differs from @xcite in that the extra @xmath3 gauge sector prevents bilinear mixings of the higgs doublets introduced .",
    "the dimensionless coupling of the quartic mixing terms can be chosen to be small enough so that the lightest neutral higgs mass eigenstate has negligible coupling to the fourth generation fermions .",
    "thus , although both of them couple to vector bosons , the lighter higgs have no coupling to the fourth generation fermions and hence can evade the lhc exclusion range coming from @xmath51 process .",
    "the heavier higgs couple to fourth generation only and can be as heavy as the unitarity bound to stay outside the current lhc search range .",
    "it may be noted that in @xcite there is no physical mechanism to prevent the extra higgs doublet vev from feeding into the lighter fermion masses whereas our model provides an explanation for this by the non - universal couplings of the extra @xmath3 gauge boson to the fermions which allows only @xmath22-first three generation and @xmath46-fourth generation couplings .",
    "the relic abundance of a dark matter particle @xmath58 is given by the the boltzmann equation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number density of the dark matter particle @xmath58 and @xmath61 is the number density when @xmath58 was in thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xmath62 is the hubble rate and @xmath63 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section of the dark matter particle @xmath58 . in terms of partial wave expansion @xmath64 .",
    "numerical solution of the boltzmann equation above gives @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the freeze - out temperature , @xmath68 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of freeze - out .",
    "dark matter particles with electroweak scale mass and couplings freeze out at temperatures approximately in the range @xmath69 .",
    "this again simplifies to @xcite @xmath70 the thermal averaged annihilation cross section @xmath71 is given by @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 s are modified bessel functions of order @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the mass of dark matter particle and @xmath76 is the temperature .",
    "we consider two annihilation cross sections of cosmological importance , namely @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 is any standard model fermion .",
    "the first process can take place via s - channel exchange of @xmath54 and @xmath80 boson .",
    "the second process can take place via s - channel @xmath54 or higgs boson @xmath62 exchange or t - channel exchange of charged leptons . since there is no mixing of fourth generation with the first three generation ,",
    "this charged lepton is the fourth charged lepton @xmath81 . in our model",
    ", we always consider @xmath82 so as to make the fourth generation neutrino perfectly stable .",
    "thus only the s - channel annihilation processes are of interest . the cross section for @xmath83 final state through @xmath54",
    "boson exchange and @xmath84 final has been calculated in @xcite and we use their standard result .",
    "the s - channel @xmath80 boson exchange cross section is @xmath85 @xmath86\\ ] ] where @xmath87,@xmath88 are the vector and axial couplings of fermions to the @xmath80 boson respectively ; @xmath89 is the color factor which is 3 for quarks and 1 for leptons , @xmath90 $ ] and @xmath91 s are defined as @xmath92        the relic density as a function of the fourth generation neutrino mass @xmath93 is shown in the figure [ fig1 ] . in this mass range @xmath94 ,",
    "the only possible annihilation channels are the @xmath95 through s - channel exchange of z - boson or x - boson(depending on the mass of @xmath96 ) . in this particular example , the @xmath3 gauge charges are chosen as @xmath97 .",
    "also we have taken the extra @xmath3 coupling to be @xmath98 and the @xmath3 symmetry breaking scale to be @xmath99 tev which results in @xmath100 .",
    "thus the x - boson mediating channel opens only when @xmath101 .",
    "as we go beyond this mass range , more and more annihilation channels become important and hence reduces the relic abundance further .",
    "it is seen from the figure [ fig1 ] that the fourth generation dirac neutrino can at most give rise to @xmath1 of the total dark matter abundance estimated by seven - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations @xcite @xmath102 thus fourth generation dirac neutrino if stable or long lived , like in the minimal version of our model , can give rise to a very small fraction of total dark matter in the universe and hence of little cosmological significance .",
    "however it can have distinct collider signatures .",
    "being heavy and stable , it can give rise to a large missing transverse energy in the colliders .",
    "we have studied one possible framework which gives rise to the experimentally allowed neutrino mass spectra in four generation models .",
    "the standard model gauge group is enhanced to include one extra abelian gauge symmetry @xmath3 under which the fourth generation fermions transform differently from the first three generations .",
    "we have assumed zero mixing between the fourth and first three generations and showed that there can be a common seesaw mechanism which can generate three light standard model neutrinos and one heavy stable fourth generation dirac neutrino .",
    "we also point out that our model reproduces the higgs - fermion structure considered by the authors of @xcite with certain differences .",
    "gauge structure of our model naturally prevents bilinear mixing between the two higgs doublets and provides a physical mechanism why one doublet couples only to the first three generations and the other couples only to the fourth generation .",
    "thus the higgs which couple to the fourth generation only can be as heavy as the unitarity bound so as to evade the current lhc exclusion range for generic standard model with four generations.the lighter higgs do not couple to fourth generation at tree level and hence can also evade the lhc exclusion range .",
    "we also consider the possibility of such a heavy neutrino as dark matter and found out the relic density .",
    "however , we find that for the mass range @xmath103 , fourth generation dirac neutrino can at most give rise to @xmath104 of the total dark matter in the universe and hence can play a role in multi component dark matter formalisms .",
    "it can also have important collider signatures in terms of missing transverse energies the details of which we have skipped in our present work .",
