    "in the past decade , the data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have drammatically enhanced our picture of the milky way .",
    "this includes comprehensive galactic structure studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , discoveries of overdensities and tidal streams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as discoveries of a significant population of ultra faint milky way satellites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) .",
    "an example from @xcite given in figure  [ clumps ] shows a detection of two low - contrast disk overdensities in stellar number density maps constructed from sdss observations of @xmath0 million stars .    the sdss is a digital photometric and spectroscopic survey .",
    "it has covered a contiguous region of about 7,600 deg@xmath1 centered on the north galactic cap , a smaller but deeper area in the galactic south ( @xmath2 deg@xmath1 ) , and approximately @xmath3deg@xmath1 of imaging for the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) . more generally , it is an example of the kind of deep , wide and accurate surveys that will be increasingly common in this decade .",
    "a non - exhaustive list includes pan - starrs ps1 @xcite that has already surpassed the sdss in terms of covered area in less than 6 months after the start of its science mission , skymapper ( keller et al . 2005 ) , currently in commissioning , the large sky area multi - object fibre spectroscopic telescope ( lamost ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the dark energy survey ( des ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and of course gaia @xcite and lsst @xcite .",
    "all these , including gaia , share the common thread of aiming to produce and publish large ( @xmath4 objects ) and wide area datasets , a challenge the sdss has already faced and successfully tackled .",
    "the lessons learned from sdss are many . here we limit ourselves to only two specific areas of immediate interest to gaia and its users : deciding when and what to publish , and appropriately approaching the published data .",
    "the sdss has published the first public release of its data ( the `` early data release '' ; edr ) in june 2001 @xcite .",
    "it consisted of roughly @xmath5 deg@xmath6 of imaging data , @xmath7 follow - up spectra ( about 5% of the planned totals ) and a photometric and astrometric catalog of @xmath814 million objects .    by today",
    "s sdss collaboration standards , the data included in this release would be considered substandard , even embarrassing . to illustrate this point , at the time of the edr even the true filter bandpasses were not known",
    ", the photometric calibration was at 3 - 5% level ( as opposed to current @xmath9% ) , and the output formats and tables in the data distribution system were far from being finalized .    in spite of these deficiencies ,",
    "the edr was a major success ( and never criticized as premature ) .",
    "first , it demonstrated that the survey was collecting and processing data ( an important milestone for a project 10 years in the making ) .",
    "secondly , the release generated invaluable feedback from the community which was incorporated into , and significantly strenghtened the subsequent data releases .",
    "most importantly , the data described in the edr produced substantial scientific returns , including ( of importance to galactic astronomy ) the discovery of the monoceros stream @xcite . at the time of writing of this contribution , the edr paper has been cited 1215 times .",
    "the sdss has continued with releases on a 12 - 18 month schedule , with the latest ( 8@xmath10 ) data release planned for december 2010 .",
    "besides adding more area , every new release involves reprocessing of _ all previously published data _ to correct problems identified in the older releases , as well as to benefit from major improvements in the processing software ( for example , the inclusion of an improved photometric calibration algorithm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in sdss experience , many of the problems reported by users were very subtle and practically the only way to discover them was to perform  cutting - edge \" science analysis and then critically examine the results .",
    "the sdss is far from alone in this approach .",
    "the rave survey @xcite , as well as ukidss @xcite , follow the same strategy .",
    "the planned large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) will follow a similar yearly release schedule .",
    "this `` release early , release often '' approach is also well known in open source software development @xcite . the early data releases result in better communication and feedback from the wider astrophysical community , improve the quality of the published datasets , and reduce the overall `` time to science '' .",
    "we feel the same model is applicable to gaia .",
    "in addition to helping the gaia project team discover and correct problems as they appear , early releases will surely generate a significant amount of follow - up science , enable synergies with ground based surveys such as lsst ( see section  [ lsst ] ) , as well as benefit the project in terms of education and public outreach .",
    "the paradigm described above puts an important onus of responsibility on the users to take into account the evolving nature of the datasets . as will be noted elsewhere in this volume ( see the contribution by hogg ) , the only `` final '' product a survey can ever deliver are the _",
    "raw images_. everything else , including the catalogs , is a _ derived product _ and subject to change as the understanding of the instrument , the processing algorithms , or the underlying assumptions ( priors ) evolve . to the best of our knowledge , no survey ever had all of these requirements well known early .",
    "however , the benefits of the early and regular access to data as they are collected by far outweigh difficulties associated with evolving datasets .",
    "the end users need to be aware of these caveats , especially when making use of the early data releases that will not have the full quality and reliability traditionally expected from a published catalog . of course , while certainly a potential source of frustration , good understanding of ( any ! ) dataset and its limits significantly improves the quality and longevity of the resulting science . again ,",
    "early and frequent data releases not only help users to understand  the survey error bars \" , but perhaps more importantly help the project team to improve them before it is too late to  fix the problem \" .",

    "the curve marked `` sdss '' corresponds to a single sdss observation .",
    "the red curves correspond to gaia ; the long - dashed curve shows a single _ transit _ accuracy , and the dot - dashed curve the end of mission accuracy ( assuming 70 transits ) .",
    "the blue curves correspond to lsst ; the solid curve shows a single _ visit _ accuracy , and the short - dashed curve shows accuracy for co - added data ( assuming 230 visits in the @xmath13 band ) .",

    "]    the large synoptic survey telescope , ( lsst ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will be a large , wide - field ground - based system designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky visible from its location at cerro pachn , chile . the current baseline design , with an 8.4 m ( 6.7 m effective ) primary mirror , a 9.6 deg@xmath6 field of view , and a 3,200 megapixel camera , will allow about 10,000 square degrees of sky to be covered using pairs of 15-second exposures in two photometric bands every three nights on average .",
    "the survey area will include 30,000 deg@xmath6 with @xmath14 , and will be imaged multiple times in six bands , @xmath15 , covering the wavelength range 3201050 nm .",
    "about 90% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep - wide - fast survey mode which will observe a 20,000 deg@xmath6 region about 1000 times in six bands during anticipated 10 years of operations .",
    "these data will result in databases including about 20 billion objects .",
    "lsst will produce a massive and exquisitely accurate photometric and astrometric dataset for about 10 billion milky way stars .",
    "the coverage of the galactic plane will yield data for numerous star - forming regions , and the @xmath16 band data will penetrate through the interstellar dust layer .",
    "photometric metallicity measurements will be available for about 200 million main - sequence f / g stars which will sample the halo to distances of 100 kpc @xcite .",
    "no other existing or planned survey will provide such a massive and powerful dataset to study the outer halo ( including gaia which is flux limited at @xmath17 , and pan - starrs which will not have the @xmath18 band ) .",
    "the lsst in its standard surveying mode will be able to detect rr lyrae and classical novae out to 400 kpc , and hence explore the extent and structure of the halo out to half the distance to m31 .",
    "all together , the lsst will enable studies of the stellar distribution beyond the presumed edge of the galactic halo , of their metallicity distribution throughout most of the halo , and of their kinematics beyond the thick disk / halo boundary @xcite .    in the context of gaia",
    ", the lsst can be thought of as its deep complement .",
    "a comparison of lsst and gaia performance is given in figure  [ lsstvsgaia ] .",
    "gaia will provide an all - sky catalog with unsurpassed trigonometric parallax , proper motion and photometric measurements to @xmath19 for about @xmath20 stars .",
    "lsst will extend this map to @xmath21 over half of the sky , detecting about @xmath22 stars .",
    "because of gaia s superb astrometric and photometric quality , and lsst s significantly deeper reach , the two surveys are highly complementary : gaia will map the milky way s disk with unprecedented detail , and lsst will extend this map all the way to the halo edge ( eyer et al .",
