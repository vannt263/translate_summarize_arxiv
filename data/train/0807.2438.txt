    "in recent years it has been possible to study in detail the underlying chaotic dynamics of many - particle systems , thus finding interesting connections between their microscopic dynamics and the observed macroscopic behavior .",
    "for example , in the case of static properties , the largest lyapunov exponent ( lle ) , which measures the dynamical instability of phase - space trajectories to infinitesimal perturbations in the initial conditions , is related to the kosterlitz - thoules transition temperature in a system of coupled rotators with nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite , as well as to first @xcite and second - order phase transitions @xcite in particle systems with long - range interactions . for dynamical properties ,",
    "the sudden change in the gradient of the lle against energy , which corresponds to the transition from weak to strong chaos , can be detected in the macroscopic behavior of a brownian particle coupled to the system @xcite .",
    "it has also been related to transport coefficients of fluid systems with continuous potentials in non - equilibrium situations @xcite . in equilibrium",
    ", a relation has also been proposed @xcite , although for this case arguments both against @xcite and in favor @xcite have been advanced .",
    "nevertheless , these last results entail interesting possibilities , since they suggest that dynamical instability is at the origin of macroscopic transport phenomena .",
    "two different methodologies have related the lyapunov spectrum ( ls ) , defined as the sorted set of lyapunov exponents ( les ) which give the exponential rate of expansion or contraction of nearby trajectories along each independent component of the phase space , to the transport coefficients of simple fluids @xcite .",
    "however , they involve setting up non equilibrium simulations or locating special phase space trajectories .",
    "furthermore , neither of these approaches considers the perturbations in phase space underlying the les , which have attracted a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "therefore it would be desirable first to attain a more thorough understanding of the phase - space perturbations associated to the les of the most general type of dynamical models employed to study fluid systems before attempting the construction of a general theory that could relate , with enough confidence , the dynamical instability with the macroscopic behavior as described by the transport coefficients .    for some particular many - particle systems , e.g. hard - sphere fluids , the theory of les",
    "is highly developed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , their most interesting features have been discovered by means of molecular dynamics simulations , which revealed that the slowly - growing and decaying perturbations associated with the non - vanishing les closest to zero are related to , and in some cases may even be represented as , almost exact periodic vector fields coherently spread out over the physical space with well defined wave vectors , together with an almost precise stepwise structure of the considered les @xcite . from their similarity to the classical modes of fluctuating hydrodynamics , these perturbations have been named _ lyapunov modes _ ( lms ) . since their discovery @xcite , much work has been done to understand their origin and possible relevance .",
    "some analytical approaches that have been advanced to understand these small les include random - matrix dynamics @xcite , periodic orbit models @xcite , and kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "all these approaches have met with only a very limited success , since none of them has been able to satisfactorily describe the mode dynamics in all the known situations accessible to simulations .",
    "a more serious drawback is that neither has been capable to extract the transport coefficients from the lms , or to relate them , in a simple way , to hydrodynamic fluctuations .    until recently the existence of these lms",
    "could only be verified in one , two and three - dimensional hard - sphere fluids @xcite ; their existence in the case of atomic fluids with soft interactions ( both attractive and repulsive ) remained controversial @xcite , since certain features , such as the step structure in the ls , dissappear in soft - potential systems .",
    "hence , to extend the concept of lms beyond the realm of hard - core systems , a more generic definition has to be adopted , which involves both the appearance of a sharp peak of low wave number in the spatial fourier spectrum of lvs corresponding to the les closest to zero and of a minimum in the average spectral entropy , defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : tiiq ] of the present work , in that same le region . employing this more generic definition convincing evidence of the existence of the",
    "so defined lms was obtained for some soft - potential systems , namely in fluids with a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lennard - jones ( lj ) @xcite , where the aforementioned definition of lms and the spectral analysis techniques needed to detect them were developed , and two - dimensional ( 2d ) weeks - chandler - anderson ( wca ) interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "more recently , the existence of lms has been also verified in lattices of coupled hamiltonian and dissipative maps @xcite , as well as in fermi - pasta - ulam anharmonic oscillator lattices @xcite .",
    "thus all information so far available seems to indicate that the hamiltonian structure , conservation laws , and translational invariance are not necessary conditions for the existence of lms .",
    "nevertheless , since there is no theoretical scheme that can predict the existence of lms , the discovery and characterization of lms has to be done in a case - by - case basis .",
    "for example , the introduction of damping in a system of coupled hamiltonian maps does not destroy the lms , whereas the addition of that same damping to a system of coupled circle maps wipes off the lms @xcite .",
    "therefore , although lms are present in the aforementioned systems , their existence is in no way guaranteed in other situations not studied so far , such as in three - dimensional hamiltonian fluid systems with both attractive and repulsive interactions .    in this paper",
    "we perform a study of the dynamical instabilities of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) atomic fluid interacting with the full lj potential under the simulation conditions most frequently encountered in molecular dynamics studies @xcite .",
    "we assess the validity of various dynamical indicators previously proposed in the literature for our particular system .",
    "the main result of our work is that , although the spectral analysis methods proposed in ref.@xcite can be readily applied to our system , the dimensionality greatly enhances the mixing among perturbations that was already present in the case of the 1d lj gas , thus rendering both the detection and characterization of the collective perturbations even more problematic .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : the - model ] we present a survey of the model , as well as the computational details needed to obtain our results in the phase space of our system as well as a short account of the relevant theory necessary to study the perturbations of the phase space .",

    "this potential has a continuous derivative in the truncation point @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , for the 1d lj model it has been shown , by adopting the above expression for the potential , that the qualitative behavior of the lms is not greatly affected by the discontinuity of the sts potential at @xmath13 @xcite . in the next section",
    "it will be shown explicitly that this same phenomenology holds for our 3d lj fluid .",
    "the complete hamiltonian of our system is then@xmath14 with @xmath15 being the momenta of the atoms and @xmath16 their corresponding masses . in all our simulations we took the masses of the atoms equal to unity , i.e. @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 as well .",
    "the hamiltonian is then written in terms of the reduced variables @xmath20 @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the initial configuration for all simulations was set up from a fcc lattice on a square cell of sides @xmath23 .",
    "the initial momenta were drawn from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "then the @xmath24 equations of motion were numerically integrated by means of the verlet leap - frog algorithm with periodic boundary conditions and the minimum image convention applied in all directions .",
    "a time - step of @xmath25 was used in all simulations , with an equilibration period of @xmath26 steps at constant temperature obtained by a uniform rescaling of the velocities at each time - step .",
    "after the equilibration period the system was allowed to evolve at constant total energy for a period of @xmath27 time - steps . the relative energy drift for this number of time - steps is @xmath28@xmath29 , which is an acceptable compromise between accuracy and speed , since there is no systematic drift and thus the energy fluctuations are stable for the chosen time - step .",
    "all the reported results were obtained for systems of @xmath30 at a supercritical reduced temperature of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the reduced densities @xmath33 were taken within the range @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "the critical temperature and density for the lj fluid with sts potential are @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite ; thus the employed values for these variables ensure that the system state is far away from the two - phase region in the @xmath37 vs @xmath38 phase diagram , being a homogeneous fluid . finally ,",
    "since in the rest of the work reduced variables will be exclusively employed , from now on we will drop the asterisk from all symbols without risk of confusion .",
    "the phase space trajectory is represented by the variable @xmath39 , where @xmath40 . to study the local dynamical stability of our system we introduce the _ lyapunov vector _ ( lv ) as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 representing the _ _",
    "i__th particle contribution to the infinitesimal perturbations of the trajectory @xmath44 along all possible directions ( position and momentum axes ) of the phase space , thus defining the so called _ tangent space_.    according to oseledec s multiplicative ergodic theorem @xcite the remote past limit symmetric operator @xmath45^{1/[2(t - t_0)]}$ ] exists for almost every initial condition @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the fundamental matrix governing the time evolution of the perturbations @xmath48 in tangent space as @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the set of instantaneous les is defined as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 are the eigenvalues of @xmath52 . the herein employed standard procedure to compute the les consists in periodically reorthonormalizing a set of offset vectors that are time evolved by means of the matrix @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the time - averaged values of the logarithms of the renormalization factors , i.e. @xmath53 are the les @xmath54 and the set of offset vectors right after the reorthonormalization are the eigenvectors of @xmath52 , which are called _ backward _ lvs .",
    "the equivalence of the les computed by means of these two methods can be proved rigorously @xcite , but the relation between the oseledec eigenvectors and the lvs obtained via the standard method is more subtle .",
    "it is known that the backward lvs converge at an exponential rate to the oseledec eigenvectors for the inverse - time dynamics of the original system @xcite .",
    "the latter are obtained as the eigenvectors of the far future limit operator @xmath55^{1/[2(t_0-t)]}$ ] and are called _ forward _ lvs .",
    "it is to be noted that recently it has been possible to obtain from the intersection of the embedded subspaces spanned by the eigenvectors of @xmath56 ( backward lvs ) and @xmath57 ( forward lvs ) the so called _ characteristic _ lvs , which are independent of the norm and do not form an orthogonal basis @xcite .",
    "a somewhat similar algorithm has also been proposed in ref .",
    "the aforementioned schemes are based on ideas already discussed long ago @xcite , but have only been recently proposed because their implementation is by no means a simple task from a computational point of view , which is why they only have been tested in simple 1d systems .",
    "thus it is not at all clear that their implementation could be feasible in the near future for the case of our system .",
    "furthermore , since the purpose of the present work is to investigate the possible existence of lms in a 3d lj fluid , it is important to recall that the discovery of lms in all studied systems so far has been made employing the backward lvs .",
    "so it seems that the use of the clvs is not essential for the detection of lms .",
    "finally , meaningful results are still obtained by means of the backward lvs obtained from the standard procedure , such as in the recent characterization of lms in a diatomic system @xcite and the discovery of lms in the xy rotator model @xcite ; in both studies the backward lvs were employed .",
    "therefore , from now on we will refer to the numerically computed vectors ( backward lvs ) as the lvs without confusion .    in the hamiltonian case ( which we treat here ) , and also in some special homogeneous non - equilibrium situations",
    "@xcite , the les and the corresponding lvs have a symmetry property which makes unnecessary to calculate the whole spectrum . in these cases",
    "the ls thus computed is symmetrical around zero , which means that each le has a partner that is exactly its negative .",
    "this is the so called _ conjugate - pairing rule _ @xcite .",
    "therefore , only @xmath58 linearized equations for the lvs were simultaneously integrated , along with the @xmath24 nonlinear equations for the reference trajectory @xmath59 . the initial lvs @xmath60 in all our simulations consisted in a set of @xmath58 orthogonal vectors with randomly selected components .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , both the force derived from the sts potential , as well as its derivative , are not continuous at @xmath13 . in order to assess the relevance of this particular feature in the computation of the properties in the tangent space we perform additional simulations employing the potential given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sf ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ cap : ls - sts - sf ] we present the ls computed from this last potential , as well as that computed by means of the sts potential , for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath30 . as can be readily appreciated",
    "there are no significant differences , a result which supports the use of the simpler sts potential .",
    "the most relevant feature of this figure is that , as in the case of the 1d lj gas , in the smallest positive le region there is no evidence of the stepwise structure that signals the appearance of the lms in the case of hard - core systems .",
    "thus it is plausible that the same mechanism that accounts for the absence of the stepwise structure in the ls of the 1d lj gas is also at work in the present model .    in fig .",
    "[ cap : probability - density - function ] we present the probability density function for the instantaneous les @xmath63and @xmath64 for @xmath30 and @xmath65 .",
    "it can be observed that the fluctuations around their mean values increase as the lyapunov index @xmath66 increases , i.e. when going from a high to a low value of the le .",
    "it is to be observed that the fluctuations in the @xmath64 value are so great that the tails in the probability density function overlap with those corresponding to @xmath63 .",
    "these large fluctuations are certainly a reason why no stepwise structure can be found in the low-@xmath66 region of the ls .",
    "other dynamical indicators that we will present later on are also affected by this behavior of the ls at large @xmath66 values . in the same figure results for the potential given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sf ] ) are also presented ; these are quite similar to those obtained with the sts potential .",
    "thus it is confirmed that the aforementioned fluctuations are not a result of the discontinuity of the sts potential at @xmath13 .",
    "therefore this potential will be used in the rest of this work .",
    "other dynamical indicators that we will present later on are also affected by this behavior of the ls at large @xmath66 values .    in fig .",
    "[ cap : normalized - ls ] we show the normalized ls for @xmath30 and @xmath61 computed for the employed range of reduced densities .",
    "the values of the scalar length of on edge of the cubic simulation cell , as well as the values of the lle corresponding to each value of the reduced density , are reported in table  [ tab : table1 ] . as can be readily appreciated in fig .",
    "[ cap : normalized - ls ] , the ls @xmath54 corresponding to the lowest density @xmath65 can be separated into two regions . in both of them",
    "the ls is a decreasing function of the lyapunov index @xmath66 , but in the former the decrease is more pronounced than in the latter .",
    "this bending of the ls has been observed in a quasi 1d hard - disk gas @xcite as well as in the 1d lj gas @xcite , and has been related to the separation of two time scales . to properly explain this point it is important to remember that each le indicates a time scale given by its inverse , so the ls can be considered as a spectrum of time - scales .",
    "the smallest positive le region of the spectrum is dominated by macroscopic time and length scale behavior . on the other hand , the opposite region of the ls is dominated by short time scale behavior , such as local collision events . as the density increases , the collisions increase both in frequency and in the number of particles involved ; the correlation among them increases , and becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish them individually . thus it is no longer possible to make a separation of time scales , and so the ls does not present the aforementioned bending for @xmath67 . although this explanation is plausible for the ls of our 3d lj fluid , we also point out that the bending depicted in fig .",
    "[ cap : normalized - ls ] for @xmath65 ( the lowest reduced density value employed ) is less pronounced than the corresponding lowest density instance of the ls of the 1d lj gas @xcite .",
    "we interpret this fact as a signature that , even for the lowest density case , the effect of the dimensionality in the microscopic events is to enhance the correlation among them , and thus reduce the separation of time scales that is more evident in the 1d case .",
    "this explanation will be further supported in the next sections .",

    "as discussed in sec . [ sec : lyapunov - spectrum ] , the strong fluctuations of the smaller les make the perturbations in tangent space extremely unstable , rendering any coherent structure that may exist in configuration space difficult to detect . to investigate the possibility that these structures ( lms ) exist in the case of the 3d sts lj potential we have to establish a measure of the contribution of a given lv @xmath69 at each point @xmath70 of the configuration space ,",
    "regardless of which particle makes the contribution to the magnitude of the chosen lv .",
    "we have to remember that the _ _ i__th particle contribution to the infinitesimal perturbation @xmath69 consists of spatial and momentum components .",
    "since the lms can be in general considered as goldstone modes resulting from translational invariance in coordinate space @xcite , we will consider only the spatial part of the full perturbation component @xmath71 .",
    "thus , in analogy with the definition of microscopic density fluctuations @xcite , we define the _ spatial lv density _ as @xmath72 which was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and is the function to be studied afterwards . in fig .",
    "[ cap : snapshot - lv - density - components ] we present a snapshot of a single component @xmath73 of the aforementioned spatial density along the @xmath74 axis of our system . since the latter is isotropic , the results are completely analogous to those corresponding to the @xmath75 and @xmath76 components projected along their respective coordinate axes .",
    "we can readily appreciate that the spatial density corresponding to the lle is more localized than that corresponding to the le with @xmath77 , which is the lowest index value corresponding to a lv not related to the space and time translational invariance symmetries of the system and the associated conserved quantities , the total energy and the total momentum @xcite .",
    "a point to be noticed is that the localization of the lle is not so clearly defined and strong as in the 1d lj system @xcite or in hard - disk systems @xcite .",
    "this is another indication that the dimensionality of the system has indeed a strong influence on the tangent - space dynamics .",

    "it is immediate to obtain the explicit form of the longitudinal and transverse static correlation functions as    @xmath87    to simplify the analysis we will consider a coordinate system such that the wave vector @xmath88 is parallel to the _ z _ axis . then @xmath89.\\ ] ] for homogeneous systems with translational invariance the fourier transformed components of a quantity such as the spatial lv density @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , are uncorrelated @xcite .",

    "furthermore , we observe that the diagonal components of the static lv density correlation function correspond to the spatial fourier spectrum , i.e. @xmath94 . thus the static longitudinal and transverse correlation functions can be obtained from the aforementioned power spectra as @xmath95 finally , since averaging over several spatially equivalent directions will improve the statistics , we take successively the @xmath88 vector along the remaining coordinate axes _ x _ and _ y _ to obtain two more sets of longitudinal and transverse correlation functions and then average over all sets .",
    "the result are longitudinal @xmath96 and transverse @xmath97 correlation functions independent of the employed coordinate system .    at variance with the hard - core systems in which the patterns resembling transverse modes do not survive time averaging @xcite , the fourier spectral techniques so far presented have been quite successful in the case of the 1d lj system , and so there is a reasonable possibility of success in the case of our 3d lj fluid .      due to their mutual interaction , the lms in all soft potential systems are only of finite life - time . to investigate their time stability we present in fig .",
    "[ cap : time - evolution - of - peak wavenumber ] the time evolution of two quantities associated with the longitudinal static correlation function @xmath96 for the lv @xmath77 : the peak wave number @xmath98 , which indicates the position of the highest peak in the spatial fourier spectrum @xmath99 , and the _ spectral entropy _",

    "however , this behavior is greatly increased in comparison to the 1d case .",
    "there are two possible causes for this difference with the 1d results : first , the reduced temperature at which we are working is much higher ( an order of magnitude ) than that employed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; second , the dimensionality of our system is also higher , thus the mixing is easier by this enlargement in the phase space , as already explained .",

    "nevertheless , the highest value of the time averaged correlation functions is always dominated by certain low - wave - number components ; for the longitudinal correlation function we observe that the sharp - valued peak in the spectrum corresponds to diminishing @xmath98 values as the lyapunov index @xmath109 , i.e. as we go from the region of high les to the region of low les . at this point",
    "it is important to notice that this correspondence is not monotonic , since the @xmath98 value of the highest peak is attained at @xmath110 , and the height of the corresponding peak slightly diminishes , although remains well defined , for higher @xmath66 values . for the transverse correlation function depicted in fig .",

    "[ cap : high - density - lt - correlation - functions](a ) and [ cap : high - density - lt - correlation - functions](b ) , respectively .",
    "a difference with respect to the low density results is that the highest peak in each power spectra is broader than in the corresponding low - density case .",

    "nevertheless it is clear from the figure that the decrease in the @xmath98 value as @xmath66 increases is approximately monotonic , in clear contrast to the 1d case @xcite in which a sudden change of @xmath98 from a finite value to zero was interpreted as a signature of the separation of time scales mentioned in sec .",

    "( [ eq : sentro ] ) , it is immediate to obtain the average spectral entropy @xmath117 which is presented , again as function of @xmath66 , in fig . [ cap : low - density - l - kmaxcmaxh](c ) .",
    "its value decreases as the lyapunov index increases .",
    "this in turn means that lvs corresponding to smaller positive les are more localized in fourier space , i.e. they have more wave - like character than those corresponding to larger les .",
    "however , the decrease in the value of @xmath117 as the lyapunov index increases is not monotonic .",
    "we notice that already for @xmath110 the average spectral entropy has reached its minimum value , but presents a slight increase as @xmath109 , which certainly accounts for the decrease in the height of the peak in the average spectra of fig .",
    "[ cap : low - density - lt - correlation - functions](a ) .",
    "our tentative conclusion at this point is that the longitudinal lms are more vaguely defined than in the 1d case for this density value .",
    "the results corresponding to the transverse correlation function @xmath108 are presented in fig .",
    "[ cap : low - density - t - kmaxcmaxh ] .",
    "we observe that the @xmath66 range for which @xmath98 has a small value is broader compared to the results in fig [ cap : low - density - l - kmaxcmaxh](a ) .",
    "however , @xmath98 has a slight increase in value as @xmath111 , a result which is not consistent with the existence of a transverse lyapunov mode for this @xmath66 range .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the behavior of @xmath118 displayed in fig .",
    "[ cap : low - density - t - kmaxcmaxh](b ) .",
    "this last quantity has its maximum at @xmath119 , with a corresponding minimum of @xmath120 at the same @xmath66 value , as seen in fig .",
    "[ cap : low - density - t - kmaxcmaxh](c ) .",
    "this feature of the spectral entropy is inconsistent with localization in fourier space ; that is , the wave - like character of the lvs is largely diminished in the low @xmath66 region . taken together these results",
    "make us difficult to unambiguously ascertain the existence of transverse lms in the 3d lj system .    for the case of high reduced density @xmath115 fig .",
    "[ cap : high - density - l - kmaxcmaxh](a ) presents the results for @xmath98 versus the lyapunov index @xmath66 corresponding to the longitudinal correlation function @xmath107 .",
    "the behavior displayed is very different to that shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : low - density - l - kmaxcmaxh](a ) .",
    "we first notice that the fluctuations of all quantities are much smaller than those corresponding to the low - density value . in the present case",
    "the value of @xmath98 stays close to 1 for @xmath121 .",
    "then , as @xmath66 further increases and after a small transient interval , drops rather sharply to a value slightly lower than @xmath122 , which is consistent with that obtained from fig .",
    "[ cap : high - density - lt - correlation - functions](a ) .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ cap : high - density - l - kmaxcmaxh](b ) we observe that the value of @xmath116 decreases smoothly from its maximum at @xmath111 down to its minimum at @xmath123 . finally , in fig .",
    "[ cap : high - density - l - kmaxcmaxh](c ) we observe that , at variance with the low - density result , the value of the average spectral entropy @xmath124 decreases monotonically in the whole range of @xmath66 values , with a minimum for @xmath111 where the les are the smallest possible ones . from the definition of the spectral entropy",
    "we conclude that the corresponding spectra for these lvs are most significantly dominated by a few @xmath101 values .",
    "thus the lms are more sharply defined than in the low density case : a very intriguing state of affairs , since no relation was found between the spatial order of the atoms as described by @xmath112 and the highest peak in the lv power spectrum at any density value .",
    "the results for the transverse correlation function @xmath105 for the highest density studied are presented in fig .",
    "[ cap : high - density - t - kmaxcmaxh ] , which display a much reduced fluctuation level , but have nevertheless a very similar behavior , compared to those in fig .",
    "[ cap : low - density - t - kmaxcmaxh ] corresponding to the low - density case .",
    "that is , the maximum value of @xmath125 , which is coincident with the minimum value of @xmath126 , is present in a range of @xmath66 values that is far from the region in which @xmath111 , a result not entirely consistent with the existence of transverse lms .",
    "the overall picture that emerges from our results so far indicates a tangent space dynamics much more complicated than that of hard - core systems or the 1d lj fluid .",
    "the strong fluctuations in the les mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : lyapunov - spectrum ] produce a strong mixture among modes , so it is unreasonable to expect that results of the spectral analysis could convey information concerning pure modes .",
    "indeed , the maximum wave number @xmath98 for both the longitudinal and transverse correlation functions is highly unstable . in the time interval depicted in fig .",
    "[ cap : time - evolution - of - peak wavenumber ] for the longitudinal case the @xmath98 value very rarely stays close to zero .",
    "rather , it seems to wander randomly between zero and one .",
    "the instantaneous value of the spectral entropy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sentro ] ) , also seems to have a seemingly random time evolution .",
    "finally , there seems to be no correlation between the time evolution of @xmath98 and @xmath100 , which was discovered in the case of the 1d lj system and which greatly contributed to a clear - cut definition of the so called on and off states @xcite .",
    "this is a first indication that the detection of lms becomes more difficult than in the corresponding 1d case .",
    "it turns out that the time averaged longitudinal and transverse correlation functions are the relevant variables from which meaningful information about the lms can be obtained .",
    "this fact can be understood in terms of the zwanzig - mori formalism , in which the fourier components of the fluctuation of a conserved density vary slowly for a small wave number @xcite ; from these `` slow '' variables a meaningful description is then extracted .",
    "for the tangent - space dynamics the time averaged longitudinal and transverse correlation functions can be considered as the `` slow '' variables .",
    "the results presented in figs . [ cap : low - density - lt - correlation - functions ] and [ cap : high - density - lt - correlation - functions ] show that this is indeed the case ; the spectra are dominated by low wave number values , i.e. @xmath114 for @xmath65 and @xmath127 for @xmath115 , both for longitudinal and transverse correlation functions , with a corresponding broader peak in the latter case . in both cases",
    "@xmath128 , which is the smallest nonzero wave number allowed by the periodic boundary conditions used ( smaller @xmath101 values are due to the oversampling inherent to the method , see ref .",
    "another point to be noted is that , for our particular system , the longitudinal correlation function reaches its maximum value at @xmath119 , and then its height diminishes slightly , but with the peak position @xmath98 unchanged , as @xmath111 .",
    "these results can be attributed to a complicate mixing of pure modes in the low @xmath101 regime , which produces the observed degeneracy of the @xmath101 value with respect to the @xmath66 index .",
    "thus the obtained lms lose their hydrodynamic character and no dispersion relation @xmath98 vs @xmath129 as those observed in the 1d lj fluid @xcite and hard - core systems @xcite could be detected .",
    "our results even stand in contrast with those of 2d coupled map lattices , for which a dispersion relation @xmath130 indeed exist @xcite , and even more sharply with those of the 2d lj fluid , for which a corresponding dispersion relation has been claimed to hold , although for this last model the evidence seems so far to be inconclusive @xcite .",
    "the most convincing evidence of the existence of longitudinal lms for the low density state comes from the results of fig .",
    "[ cap : low - density - l - kmaxcmaxh ] .",
    "first we observe that the average spectral entropy attains its minimum at @xmath119 , a result not entirely inconsistent with those of random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "next , as @xmath131 , the value of this quantity remains close to this minimum .",
    "taken together with the already obtained position of the highest peak in the power spectrum in the region @xmath111 depicted in fig .",
    "[ cap : low - density - lt - correlation - functions](a ) , these results are compelling evidence of the existence of longitudinal lms .",
    "the fuzziness of the obtained values of the reported quantities also led us to suppose that the mixing between modes is strong . up to this point",
    "we can affirm that longitudinal lms do indeed exist , but are more vague than in the 1d lj gas and with no hydrodynamical character at all . on the other hand , our results on the transverse correlation function displayed in fig .",
    "[ cap : low - density - t - kmaxcmaxh ] , despite their fluctuations , show a tendency that does not allow us to unambiguously classify them as transverse lms .",
    "the most important result of this paper was presented in fig .",
    "[ cap : high - density - l - kmaxcmaxh ] for @xmath115 . besides a much reduced fluctuation in the studied variables , a very defined jump in @xmath98 at @xmath123 is observed .",
    "the importance of this fact is that , for the 1d lj gas , a similar jump was observed , but for a low - density value @xcite . in that system",
    "this behavior was interpreted in terms as of a separation of time scales signaled by a bending in the ls . on the contrary",
    ", we obtain a sharply defined jump in @xmath98 at a @xmath132 value in which the corresponding ls shows no bending , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ cap : normalized - ls ] . in order to try to understand this seemingly puzzling result",
    ", we have to remember that , from the suspected importance of hyperbolicity for the appearance of the lms @xcite , the main results for the 1d lj fluid were obtained in a relatively diluted regime @xcite , which made this system somewhat similar to hard - core systems previously studied @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath115 our system is far from complete hyperbolicity , since the combination of attractive and repulsive interactions induces strong correlations between the collision events that makes difficult to separate them from each other .",
    "at the same time , the aforementioned density value is not high enough to make the effective interaction among atoms similar to that of a lattice of anharmonic oscillators in which hydrodynamic lms have been detected @xcite .",
    "thus there is no obvious mechanism that could account for the sharp jump in @xmath98 when there is no bending in the ls .",
    "therefore the role of the alleged separation of time scales , inferred from the ls bending for the 1d lj gas , seems to bear no relation to the appearance and phenomenological description of the lms in our 3d lj fluid .",
    "in this paper we have performed a study of the tangent space dynamics of the 3d lj fluid in order to investigate the possible existence of the lms which are a distinctive feature of the hard - core systems .",
    "our results indicate that longitudinal modes indeed exist for low and high reduced density values , and no conclusive evidence of transverse modes for either density studied .",
    "the lack of a dispersion relation between the les and the maximum wave number make both types of modes markedly different from those already encountered in other systems .",
    "the longitudinal lms turn out to be much better defined for high values of the reduced density .",
    "previously only in hyperbolic systems could lms be detected at high density values @xcite .",
    "it is highly plausible that by changing the thermodynamic state of the system the lms could present a different behavior than the one reported in the present communication .",
    "one of the authors ( m.r.b . )",
    "wishes to acknowledge karen haneman and d. castaeda - valle for their comments and suggestions . financial support from consejo nacional de ciencia y tecnologa ( conacyt )",
    "is also acknowledged .",
    "from the fourier transform of the spatial lv density @xmath78 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dens ] ) , we can define the _ intermediate two - time correlation function _ as @xmath133 which in the 3d case is a second rank tensor with components @xmath134 . since the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : taps ] point clearly to the existence of longitudinal lms , we will concentrate on the longitudinal component of this function . by following the same methodology of sec .",
    "[ sec : slvd ] we are led to an expression for the longitudinal component of the form @xmath135 . taking * k * parallel to the other coordinate directions and averaging we obtain the final form @xmath136 .",
    "for @xmath137 we recover the time average of the static lv correlation function , i.e. @xmath138 . the dynamical lv correlation function encodes structural as well as temporal correlations , and thus provides more detailed information of the system .    by fourier transformation with respect to time",
    "we obtain the _ dynamical lv density correlation function _ ( dlvdcf ) as @xmath139 . in fig .",
    "[ cap : low - density - dlvdcf ] we present the result for @xmath65 and @xmath77 for the longitudinal dlvcf at various integer multiples of the wavevector @xmath140 .",
    "it can be observed that , besides the central peak , smaller peaks are present as the frequency @xmath141 increases .",
    "this result implies that the tangent space dynamics is described by a set of characteristic frequencies , which may have their origin in the lack of timescale separation already advanced in sec .",
    "[ sec : lyapunov - spectrum ] .",
    "however , restricting our attention to the lowest frequencies , it is clear that the position @xmath142 of the first peak can be unambiguously defined for the lowest @xmath101 value ; a similar identification can be made for other low @xmath101 values .",
    "thus a dispersion relation @xmath143 for different @xmath66 values can be extracted .",
    "the result is presented in the inset of the same figure .",
    "it is observed that an approximately linear dispersion relation is obtained and thus , besides the characteristic wavevector @xmath144 for each lm already determined in sec .",
    "[ sec : taps ] , each mode can also be characterized by a frequency @xmath145 .",
    "the non - vanishing value of @xmath146 seems to imply propagating wave - like excitations .",
    "the result for the longitudinal dlvdcf at @xmath115 is presented in fig .",
    "[ cap : high - density - dlvdcf ] . in sharp contrast with the low density state",
    "no structure can be observed whatsoever at any wavevector number .",
    "no characteristic frequency can be easily identified , which implies that no propagation of any wave - like structures occurs at any wavevector number .",
    "thus the tangent space structure described in fig .",
    "[ cap : high - density - l - kmaxcmaxh ] remains unaltered within the time scales studied .",
    "more details of the temporal dynamics in tangent space will be presented in a forthcoming study .",

    "<S> recent studies on the phase - space dynamics of a one - dimensional lennard - jones fluid reveal the existence of regular collective perturbations associated with the smallest positive lyapunov exponents of the system , called hydrodynamic lyapunov modes , which previously could only be identified in hard - core fluids . in this work we present a systematic study of the lyapunov exponents and lyapunov vectors , i.e. perturbations along each direction of phase space , of a three - dimensional lennard - jones fluid . by performing the fourier transform of the spatial density of the coordinate part of the lyapunov vector components and then time - averaging this result we find convincing signatures of longitudinal modes , with inconclusive evidence of transverse modes for all studied densities . furthermore , the longitudinal modes can be more clearly identified for the higher density values . </S>",
    "<S> thus , according to our results , the mixing of modes induced both by the dynamics and the dimensionality induce a hitherto unknown type of order in the tangent space of the model herein studied at high density values . </S>"
