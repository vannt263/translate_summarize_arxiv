    "photons at optical frequencies are commonly used in quantum key distribution systems@xcite , and play a fundamental role in proposed devices for quantum information processing@xcite . while the majority of quantum cryptography systems currently in use are based on coherent light sources , most of the proposals for more advanced quantum information devices are based on non - classical states of light , mainly single photon states .",

    "considerable research has been done to make deterministic single photon sources , which can generate indistinguishable single photons with very high efficiency .",
    "one way to generate single photons is by parametric down conversion or attenuation of coherent laser beams such that the probability of having multi - photon states is considerably diminished .",
    "however , this causes increased probability of the vacuum state , so most of the time there are no photons in the light source . to make a good single photon source one has to ensure suppression of both the multi - photon states as well as the zero - photon state",
    "there are several proposals for making on demand single photon sources , like above - band or resonant excitation of solid state single emitters @xcite or adiabatic state transfer in single atoms @xcite .    in the recent years",
    ", there has been increased interest in generating non - classical states of light via strongly coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) systems@xcite .",
    "non - classical states of light that closely resemble the single photon states can be generated in this kind of systems by operating in the photon blockade regime@xcite with a single emitter strongly coupled to an optical resonator .",
    "the photon blockade was first observed in atomic physics @xcite and recently has been demonstrated in solid state cqed using quantum dots in photonic crystal cavities@xcite .",
    "these experiments demonstrated photon anti - bunching caused by photon blockade , a signature of enhanced probability of the single photon states at the output .",
    "there are a few advantages for using photon blockade for single photon generation .",
    "first , the produced single photons are free of jitter .",
    "second , the collection efficiency of the photons is very high due to the presence of a cavity .",
    "however , for on demand single photon generation , the source must be operated in pulsed regime and one photon should be generated for each pulse .",
    "this requirement was not satisfied in any experiments performed so far on photon blockade .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the optimal conditions that must be satisfied by the cqed system for on demand generation of single photon states via photon blockade .",
    "the system considered here is a quantum dot ( qd ) strongly coupled to a photonic crystal cavity , although our conclusion is valid for any cavity qed system .",
    "we analyze two different driving configurations that lead to on demand single photon generation . in section [ sec : pulse_shaping ] we consider the system coherently driven by laser pulses . in section [ sec : stark_shift_operation ] we consider a system driven by a continuous wave laser where the deterministic single photon generation is done by electrical control of the qd resonance frequency .",

    "( b ) schematic representation of the energy eigenstates for a strongly coupled cavity - emitter system.,width=336 ]    the studied optical system consists of a single emitter ( qd ) strongly coupled to a cavity , as shown in fig.[fig_photon_blockade ] . when coherently driven by a laser field , the strongly coupled system is well described by jaynes - cummings hamiltonian :    @xmath0\\ ] ]    where , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the qd and the cavity resonance frequency respectively and @xmath3 is the driving laser frequency , @xmath4 is the coupling strength of the qd to the cavity mode .",
    "@xmath5 is the rabi frequency of the laser and is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the dipole moment of the transition being driven by the laser and @xmath8 is the temporal electric field of the laser , inside the cavity ; @xmath9 is the annihilation operator for the cavity mode .",
    "if the excited and ground state of the qd are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 then @xmath12 , @xmath13 . in a frame rotating in laser frequency , under rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) the hamiltonian can be written as :    @xmath14\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the detuning of the qd and the cavity with the laser . to fully describe a real system",
    ", loss must be included in the hamiltonian .",
    "the two main loss mechanisms are the cavity field decay rate @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the quality factor of the resonator ) and qd spontaneous emission rate @xmath19 . when the coupling strength @xmath4 is greater than the loss rates @xmath20 and @xmath19 , the system is in the strong coupling regime @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "energy eigenstates are grouped in two - level manifolds with eigen - energies given by @xmath21 ( for @xmath22 ) , where @xmath23 is the number of energy quanta in the cavity - qd system .",
    "the eigenstates can be written as :    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }        the splitting between the energy eigenstates in each manifold has a non - linear dependence on @xmath23 .",
    "this anharmonicity in the splitting of the energy eigenstates gives rise to nonlinear optics phenomena at single photon level .",
    "one of these phenomena is photon blockade , where the presence of one photon in the cavity blocks the coupling of subsequent photons .",
    "for example , the system could be driven by a coherent light source ( see fig.[fig_photon_blockade ] ) with frequency resonant with one of the polaritons ( say @xmath25 ) .",
    "once a photon is coupled , the system is excited into the state @xmath25 , so the coupling of another photon with energy @xmath26 would require the system to transition to energy state @xmath27 .",
    "however , the system does not have an eigenstate at this energy , the closest being at @xmath28 .",
    "for this reason , the probability of coupling the second photon is reduced .",
    "a typical experimental configuration for observing photon blockade is depicted in fig.[fig_photon_blockade](a ) where light can be coupled into the cavity via the input port @xmath29 and the output can be collected at the port @xmath30 .",
    "the resonator is represented by two mirrors with reflection coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "for on demand generation of non - classical states of light , it is desirable that the state is delivered at the output port at times that can be chosen deterministically .",
    "this means that the interaction between the input beam and the cavity / qd system is controlled in time domain .",
    "one way to achieve this is by driving the system with light pulses with controlled shape , as illustrated schematically in fig.[fig_shaping](a ) . in this section",
    ", we investigate how the non - classical state of light observed at the output depends on the properties of the laser pulse at the input .    in principle , the input laser pulse can have any specific waveform . to limit the number of free parameters",
    ", we analyze the configuration where the system is driven with gaussian pulses .",
    "in this case , the free parameters are the length , intensity and the center frequency of the pulse .    to simulate the system we use quantum trajectory method @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the density matrix @xmath33 of the system , including all the losses is given by ( in the normalized form with @xmath34 ) : @xmath35+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}(2a\\rho a^\\dag - a^\\dag a \\rho-\\rho a^\\dag a)+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}(2\\sigma\\rho \\sigma^\\dag-\\sigma^\\dag \\sigma \\rho-\\rho \\sigma^\\dag \\sigma)\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the system hamiltonian without any loss as given in eqn .",

    "there are mainly two decay channels : the spontaneous emission of the qd @xmath44 and the cavity decay @xmath45 .",
    "the dephasing rate of the qd and any non - radiative decay is neglected . as the non - classical state is collected from one of the output modes of the cavity ( @xmath30 )",

    "[ eqn : h2 ] is assumed to be of the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the amplitude and the time dependence is described by @xmath48 . for the simulation",
    "we assume a gaussian shape for @xmath48 :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the time when the pulse reaches its maximum value and @xmath51 is the pulse - width .",
    "the non - classical state of light emitted at the output is analyzed using an ideal single photon detector .",
    "for each quantum trajectory , a laser pulse is coupled to the cavity and the number of clicks detected at the output is monitored . ideally ,",
    "for a deterministic single photon source , a single click should be registered by the detector every time the device is operated .",
    "however , the output field is not in a pure single photon state , and in a fock state basis , it can be expressed as :    @xmath52    where the @xmath53 is the coefficient of the fock state @xmath54 .",
    "here we write the output state as a pure state considering that the dephasing rate of the system is negligible .",
    "the normalized value ( @xmath55 ) of the coefficients @xmath56 can be estimated from the number of detected photons at the output when running a large number of trajectories .",
    "for example , @xmath57 is well estimated by the relative number of trajectories for which @xmath23 counts were detected at the output .",
    "if the desired output state should be as close as possible to a single photon state , then the simulation parameters should be optimized such that @xmath58 is maximized .",
    "the experimental configuration considered here is as shown in figure [ fig_shaping](a ) .",
    "the cavity has two mirrors , with decay rates @xmath59 and @xmath60 such that @xmath61 .",
    "effectively , the total decay rate of the cavity is @xmath62 .",
    "the driving laser is incident on the mirror with higher reflectivity and the output field is mainly collected from the lossier mirror .",
    "this configuration allows for efficient collection of the non - classical field at the cavity output .    to illustrate the behavior of the system operating in photon blockade under pulsed driving , we first analyze a system with parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "the value @xmath63 corresponds to a cavity with a quality factor of @xmath66 .",
    "this is about 5 times larger than the state of the art values of @xmath18 observed in gaas cavities with coupled inas quantum dots operating around 930 nm , but still withing the theoretical limit for this material @xcite .",
    "regarding the coupling rate @xmath4 , the typical values measured so far are around @xmath67@xcite .",
    "however , with further improvements in the material system and the fabrication techniques it is expected that higher values for @xmath18 and @xmath4 , as considered here , will be achievable . for this simulation ,",
    "the cavity and the quantum dot are assumed to be on resonance ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the center frequency of the driving field is set on resonance with the transition to the first order manifold ( @xmath69 ) and the pulse width is set to @xmath70 .",
    "figure [ fig_shaping](b ) shows the zero - photon , single photon as well as multi - photon population ( @xmath71 ) as a function of the amplitude of a driving pulse .",
    "the values for the coefficients @xmath55 are inferred from the number of detection events detected over multiple ( 3000 ) quantum trajectories .    as shown in fig.[fig_shaping](b ) , the probability of obtaining a single photon at the output has a strong oscillatory dependence on the intensity on the incoming pulse .",
    "when operating in blockade regime , the successful blocking of the second photon depends on how well the first photon is coupled to the qd - cavity system .",
    "one could consider the ground state and the state @xmath72 to constitute an effective two - level system . under pulsed excitation ,",
    "the population in @xmath72 rabi oscillates with the pulse area(fig . [ fig_photon_blockade](b ) ) . for optimum operation",
    ", one would choose the pulse area such that the system transitions completely from @xmath73 to @xmath72 so one photon is coupled into the system and then is released at the output port . at the operation point with maximum single photon state probability , the output field has @xmath74 single photon , @xmath75 vacuum state and @xmath76 multi - photon state character ( i.e. @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) .",
    "the oscillations of the single photon population in the output field can also be observed when the maximum field intensity is kept constant and the pulse length is changed .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig_shaping](c ) , where the pulse intensity was chosen as the intensity that gave the maximum single photon output in fig.[fig_shaping](c ) ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "a similar but less prominent effect can be observed in a system with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , parameters that are very close to those already achieved experimentally @xcite . for this set of parameters",
    "the maximum achievable single photon probability is @xmath83 , with @xmath84 vacuum state and @xmath85 multi photon state , as shown in fig.[fig_shaping](d ) .",
    "one of the main advantages of generating non - classical states of light using photon blockade instead of above band excitation and spectral filtering , is the high degree of indistinguishability of the output field .",
    "the two main effects that affect the single photon indistiguishability is the quantum dot jitter and dephasing@xcite .",
    "while jitter is completely avoided using this method , the output field still suffers from the dephasing of the quantum dot while the optical pulse passes through the cavity . to maximize the indistinguishability , it is thus desirable to operate with shorter laser pulses .",
    "in this section we present an alternative method for on demand generation of non - classical light that is based on ultra - fast control of the optical dipole .",
    "the principle is depicted in fig.[electrical_control](a ) , where a continuous wave field is incident on the input port and the frequency of the dipole ( @xmath86 ) is controlled at time - scales comparable to the cavity decay rate .",
    "one method to achieve this kind of ultra - fast control in solid - state systems is by using an electric - field to shift the frequency of a quantum dot via quantum confined stark effect@xcite .    in this configuration ,",
    "the cavity frequency is kept constant and the electric field controlls the cavity - quantum dot detuning . with the quantum dot and the cavity on resonance , the input laser",
    "is tuned to the frequency of one of the first order eigenstates ( say @xmath72 ) .",
    "shifting the resonance of the quantum dot causes an energy shift of both first order eigenstates . to generate single photon states",
    ", one should start with the quantum dot detuned from the cavity such that no light is transmitted to the output .",
    "then the quantum dot is brought into resonance with the cavity such that @xmath72 becomes resonant with the input laser beam .",
    "the qd is kept resonant with the cavity so only one photon is coupled and transmitted through the system , and then it is detuned back as shown in fig.[electrical_control](b ) .",

    "[ electrical_control](c - d ) for different parameters of the strongly coupled system .",
    "the quantum dot frequency is detuned by up to @xmath4 , as shown in in fig . [ electrical_control](b ) .",
    "similar to the optical time domain pulse shaping , oscillations are observed in the magnitude of the single photon state for @xmath63 , @xmath65 ( fig.[electrical_control](c ) ) . for optimal operation parameters , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",

    "in conclusion , we have shown that the non - classical states of light that can be generated using the strong optical nonlinearity of a solid - state cavity qed system ( photon blockade regime ) have a strong dependence on the properties of the input driving field .",
