    "the electric double layer is generally viewed as simply the boundary that interpolates between an electrolyte solution and a metal surface .",

    ", the double layer undergoes an abrupt local ordering transition .",
    "the emergent ordered structure is consistent with that of room temperature ionic liquids found on mica surfaces  @xcite . at another voltage , the interfacial charge density changes abruptly .",
    "this change appears to be consistent with observations of anomalous electrical capacitance observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "further , we show that this anomaly grows with increasing electrode surface area , suggesting a singular charge - density transition in a macroscopic limit . these nonlinear electrochemical responses , whose molecular origins we elucidate , offer a view of the electric double layer that deviates significantly from standard mean - field models .    generally , when an electrical potential is applied to an electrode in contact with an electrolyte it induces a local , partial demixing of the cations and anions at the interface .",
    "the surface charge is equal and opposite to the net charge in the double layer and thus at a given potential reflects the facility of the interfacial fluid to adopt a structure giving rise to that charge .",
    "the canonical model for the interfacial region of an electrolyte at an electrode surface , the electric double layer , is that of gouy and chapman ( gc )  @xcite .",
    "this mean - field model applies to a dilute solution of point ions and predicts that the degree of demixing induced by the voltage decreases exponentially with distance from a planar electrode surface and that the differential capacitance of the electrode - electrolyte double - layer increases monotonically with the magnitude of the applied electrode potential .",
    "recently , there has been a great deal of interest in electrochemical interfaces of room temperature ionic liquids ( rtils ) driven in part by the potential for constructing supercapacitors that exploit this charge separation to create high power energy storage devices  @xcite .",
    "far from a collection of noninteracting point charges rtils are dense mixtures of ions , whose physical properties are largely determined by correlations between ions .",
    "effects arising from correlations within rtils at electrochemical interfaces have been observed experimentally and in simulation  @xcite . specifically , layering has been observed in x - ray reflectivity experiments  @xcite , is detected in surface force and afm experiments  @xcite and has been examined in a number of computer simulation studies  @xcite .",
    "some of the latter have illustrated how the polarization of the charge density in an ionic liquid in response to an electrode potential is affected by this layering and the strong local coulomb ordering of the ions  @xcite . in - plane",
    "ordering of the ions in rtil has been detected at the liquid - vapor interface by x - ray scattering  @xcite , on mica surfaces by afm  @xcite , and on gold electrodes by stm  @xcite .",
    "some simulations  @xcite have reproduced this effect and indicated a connection to changes in the electrode charge density . using in - situ stm and afm measurements , atkin , endres and co - workers underlined the influence of phenomena such as surface reconstruction ( _ e.g. _ with gold electrodes ) and of impurities on the interfacial structure  @xcite and demonstrated the advantage of combining these techniques with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to investigate these aspects  @xcite .    not surprisingly then",
    ", the experimentally observed dependence of the differential capacitance on potential has often been found to depart markedly from the predictions of gc theory , often decaying with increasing potential and exhibiting sharp peaks that are interpreted as abrupt changes in the local ionic structuring .",
    "efforts to extend gc theory to include effects from packing of ions have been made at the mean - field level with some success  @xcite .",
    "these account approximately for layering at the interface  @xcite and the tendency for local coulombic ordering of the ions at high voltage  @xcite .",
    "specifically , kornyshev and coworkers have demonstrated the effect of these extensions on the differential capacitance , qualitatively reproducing some features observed in rtils  @xcite .",
    "however , correlations in - plane and effects from fluctuations have not been considered , omitting molecular detail and its role in determining the electrochemical properties of these systems .",
    "such features are however essential in conditions where the liquid undergoes large structural reorganization , which as we discuss below , are intimately connected to non - monotonic features of the differential capacitance .    here",
    "we address the correspondence between structure , fluctuations and electrochemical response in rtils directly by applying novel simulation methods .",
    "such methods are robust and free of assumptions related to the relative importance of correlations that constrain mean - field models . in section",

    "the re - weighting method also enables us to obtain much better statistical precision than in the previous simulation studies through the utilization of data from multiple simulations .",
    "such techniques are especially necessary when studying collective behavior , as timescales for reorganization make straightforward simulation methods prohibitive .    to generate configurations for this histogram re - weighing technique , molecular dynamics simulations were conducted in the nve ensemble with a time step of 2  fs . for each simulation , a 200  ps equilibration at @xmath1  k",

    "the peaks in capacitance arise from correlations within the interfacial layer of fluid .",
    "this is evident from the electrode surface charge distributions that exhibit non - gaussian features characteristic of a first - order phase transition  fat tails at conditions away from phase coexistence and a very flat distribution suggesting incipient bi - modality ( limited here by a rather small system size ) at conditions of coexistence  @xcite .",
    "if the relevant structures in the fluid comprise correlated domains that are small compared to the net surface area , the distribution will be gaussian because the net surface - charge density will reflect many uncorrelated contributions ( the usual central limit theorem argument ) .",
    "generally , the distribution , @xmath17 , shifts according to applied voltage , @xmath25 in the gaussian case , vertical sections through the free energy surface , @xmath26 , will be parabolas with minima at the mean value of @xmath3 , and the application of voltage will produce a proportional shift of that mean - the free energy surface would have the form of a regular valley with the position of the minimum tracking the voltage smoothly .",
    "this is what has been found previously for simple dielectrics or dilute solutions  @xcite .",
    "if the correlated domains extend across the entire surface , the distribution will be non - gaussian , and the application of voltage will shift the free energy minimum in a markedly non - linear way as different domain types are stabilized by different voltages .",
    "it is clear that the surface - charge distributions found in the simulations correspond most closely to the latter scenario and that , although the non - gaussian characteristics are a global property of the free energy surface , they will be most pronounced at potentials close to 0.9v .",
    "the size of our system is small , so that the non - gaussian features are relatively subtle .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath28 scales inversely with @xmath4 . at conditions of a coexistence between two phases , however , @xmath18 will grow with system size because cooperativeness at a phase transition extends across the surface .",
    "the growth is significant .",
    "ultimately , the capacitance at this voltage should increase linearly with @xmath4 , but the system sizes we have been able to study are not yet large enough to reach that scaling regime .",
    "the fluctuations we consider might thus foreshadow an unbounded capacitance , a phenomenon that it not predicted by previous theories even beyond mean - field  @xcite .",
    "while studying larger system sizes in detail is not possible with the computer resources currently available to us , we can nevertheless test the consequences of a putative first order transition . for larger systems",
    ", one should expect a bimodal distribution of surface charge density with basins of the charge distribution separated by a free energy barrier growing with system size .",
    "we have performed simulations with a system size increased by 100% in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions for voltages close to the estimated coexistence voltage of 0.9v . for these large systems ,",
    "both the ordered and disordered states are metastable over time scales of 500  ps , and the corresponding charge distributions do not overlap .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the expected one for a first order transition .",
    "it raises the usual issue for studying phase transitions in molecular simulations : proper sampling requiring long simulation times and enhanced sampling techniques .",
    "such an investigation could benefit from the development of simplified models and analytical theory capable of capturing the physical phenomena which underpin these effects .",
    "with these caveats in mind , note that such a transition would also lead to hysteresis in a macroscopic system , and that hysteresis has been ob- served experimentally for a very similar ionic liquid on graphene using x - ray reflectivity  @xcite .",
    "the charge density @xmath3 is the same on both electrodes ( up to a sign change ) . its average value and its variance ( hence the capacitance , see eq .",
    "[ eq : capa - fluct ] ) reflect the response of the whole capacitor . in order to provide a microscopic interpretation for the observations described above ,",
    "we have examined several order parameters based upon averages over the ionic positions at each electrode . given the difference in shape and size between cations and anions , the microscopic structure of the interface is likely to differ at positive and negatively charged electrodes . in the following ,",
    "results are reported as a function of the variable @xmath31 defined as @xmath32 ( resp .",
    "@xmath33 ) for the positive ( resp . negative ) electrode when the capacitor is submitted to a voltage @xmath11 . since in the present system",

    ". examples of the density profiles at higher potentials for this system have been shown elsewhere  @xcite and layering similar to that indicated in the figure persists over the full range of potentials studied here .",
    "although the layering is a generic property of dense fluids , the arrangement of the ions within the layers depends on the details of the interionic interactions . in the present case , at 0v ,",
    "the maxima in the principal peaks of the anion and cation densities coincide , which shows that both ions have roughly the same size and may approach the surface equally closely ( the small shoulder appearing on the cation peaks arises from different possible orientations of the cations on the surface ) .",
    "if the ions were of very different size , the cation and anion layers could be displaced from each other , as seen _",
    "e.g. _ in ref .",
    "furthermore , from the areas of corresponding cation and anion peaks for the first two layers it follows that a given layer contains a very similar number of cations and anions ( a feature we explore in detail below ) .",
    "this will be favored ( at low electrode surface charge , and in the absence of strong attractive interactions of one species with the surface ) by the coulombic interactions between the ions which will try to impose local charge neutrality .",
    "* in - plane order * the in - plane anion structure factor for the anions in the first adsorbed layer on a given electrode is @xmath34 where the sum runs over pairs of anions that are found in the first layer of fluid adjacent to the electrode surface and @xmath35 is a wavevector which lies in the plane of the electrode and is commensurate with the periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the interface may explore configurations with varying degrees of in - plane order .",
    "the bottom part corresponds to a fluid - like configuration , whereas the top one shows a strong , bragg - like peak at @xmath39 , which corresponds to @xmath40 divided by the mean nearest - neighbor separation of the anions in the first layer , and strongly suggests a 2-d lattice - like organization for the anions .",
    "figures  [ fig : skmax]b and  [ fig : skmax]c show snapshots which illustrate such ordered and disordered structures , respectively . the relative contribution of these structures to an averaged property of the interfacial fluid , like the in - plane structure factor , depends on the voltage , as we shall see below .",
    "in particular , the lattice - like ordering only persists for a certain range of applied potentials .",
    "the length scales of the underlying graphite play no role in this ordered structure .",
    "indeed , structures like it are inferred from experiments of monolayers of bmi - pf@xmath0 on gold  @xcite .",
    "this is not to say that other systems can not show an effect of commensurability between in - plane order in the electrolyte and the surface  @xcite .",
    "but the role of graphite in the system studied here is only that of a polarizable metal .",
    "note also that the geometry of the triangular lattice is distinct from that of the ( nearly ) square electrode that is periodically replicated in the simulation .",
    "thus , the ordered state we find in the simulation is not a finite - size artifact of the simulation geometry .    in fig .",

    "this plot reveals a substantial basin of stability for the ordered state of the first interfacial layer of fluid for potential differences @xmath11 between about 0.5 and 0.75v ( remember that @xmath43 ) .",
    "this basin is present on both electrodes , even though the ordered state is less probable on the negative electrode . at both higher and lower",
    "voltages the fluid layer is translationally disordered .",
    "this observation strongly suggests that the peak in the differential capacitance observed as the potential is increased through 0.9v is associated with the transition between an ordered , lattice - like state of the first layer and the disordered state .",
    "the first - order nature of this phase transition , which is evident from free energy surface in @xmath41 , shows up in the statistics of the electrode surface - charge fluctuations and the resulting peak in the differential capacitance .",
    "however , the transition from the low potential , disordered state to the ordered state , which might be expected at about @xmath44v , does not appear to affect the surface charge significantly .",
    "although a transition in first - layer structure is seen in @xmath45 , it does not appear to be strongly coupled to the surface charge .    in the present case ,",
    "the transitions on both electrodes occur approximately at the same voltage @xmath11 . for systems where the difference in size and shape between cations and anions is stronger , or where the fine structure of the electrode plays a more important role ,",
    "such transitions may occur for different voltages on each electrode .",
    "for example , previous work on electrochemical cells involving a molten salt , licl , and ( 100 ) aluminum electrodes , an order - disorder transition occurred in the first adsorbed layer close to the potential of zero charge  @xcite . for positive surface charges , an ordered structure , commensurate to the underlying metal structure",
    "was stabilized while the structure was liquid - like otherwise . as a result ,",
    "a large step was observed on the charge vs. potential plot , which should be in principle associated to a large peak in the differential capacitance .",
    "such a peak could not be evidenced since the importance sampling tools discussed here had not been introduced at that time .",
    "the asymmetric behavior could be attributed in that case to the large difference in polarizability between the lithium and chloride ions .",
    "as soon as the polarization effects ( on the ions ) were turned off , the ordered structure was unable to form , leading to an almost constant differential capacitance over the whole simulated potential range  @xcite .",
    "* cation orientation and stoichiometry of the layers * the orientation of cations in the first ionic layer on the electrode evolves with the applied potential @xmath11 .",
    "this can be measured using angles such as the one between the imidazolium ring - butyl ( c1-c3 ) axis and the normal to the surface , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle](a ) .",
    "the distributions of these angles as a function of @xmath31 are reported in figs .",
    "[ fig : angle](b ) , [ fig : angle](c ) and  [ fig : angle](d ) . on both electrodes ,",
    "the c1-c3 axis remains almost parallel to the surface for all voltages . on the contrary , the distribution of the ring - methyl ( c1-c2 ) orientation displays bimodality , with relative weights of the two configurations that evolve with the applied voltage .",

    "with increasing voltage , the fraction of tilted cations increases on the positive electrode and decreases on the negative one .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the electrostatic interaction between the positive partial charge of the methyl group and the electrodes .",
    "the fact that the bulkier butyl and imidazolium ring remain closer to the surface may be due to packing effects , their smaller charge density compared to the methyl group and to the stronger attractive dispersion interaction with the wall , in agreement with observations for a model cation consisting of a charged head and a neutral tail  @xcite .",

    "the preferred cation number in the first layer remains constant until @xmath11 reaches 1.0v and there is initially , close to zero volts , an apparent charge imbalance in the first layer because the number of cations exceeds that of anions .",
    "when the voltage @xmath11 exceeds about 0.35v the number of anions at both electrodes increases so that it balances the number of cations .",
    "this occurs because cations become increasingly orientationally ordered by larger applied potentials and this allows enough space for the additional anions to enter the first layer . as the ions become tightly packed in the first layer , the structure factor develops its bragg - like peak ( fig .",

    "<S> using molecular dynamics simulations with recently developed importance sampling methods , we show that the differential capacitance of a model ionic liquid based double - layer capacitor exhibits an anomalous dependence on the applied electrical potential . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior is qualitatively incompatible with standard mean - field theories of the electrical double layer , but is consistent with observations made in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous response results from structural changes induced in the interfacial region of the ionic liquid as it develops a charge density to screen the charge induced on the electrode surface . </S>",
    "<S> these structural changes are strongly influenced by the out - of - plane layering of the electrolyte and are multifaceted , including an abrupt local ordering of the ions adsorbed in the plane of the electrode surface , reorientation of molecular ions , and the spontaneous exchange of ions between different layers of the electrolyte close to the electrode surface . </S>",
    "<S> the local ordering exhibits signatures of a first - order phase transition , which would indicate a singular charge - density transition in a macroscopic limit . + </S>",
