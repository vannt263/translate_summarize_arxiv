    "the original randall - sundrum scenario contains only two , widely separated , energy scales associated respectively with the bulk and the ir brane physics . since these scales could naturally be exponentially different , this model provides an attractive alternative explanation of the hierarchy between the gravitational and electroweak physics . in this article",
    "we have shown that other , intermediate scales can be incorporated into the randall - sundrum scenario , such as are needed for the invisible axion solution to the strong cp problem .    the basic requirement for generating a scale much lower than the planck mass from a bulk field is to find a mechanism which excludes this field from the region near the uv brane .",
    "the introduction of an intermediate brane produces this behavior .",
    "when the potential on the uv brane causes the field to vanish there , most of the contribution to the effective symmetry breaking scale comes from the region between the intermediate and the ir brane .",
    "the position of the intermediate brane then determines the scale needed by the invisible axion . in this scenario ,",
    "the @xmath5 symmetry breaking proceeds differently than in standard @xmath28 picture since it results from the non - trivial profile of the bulk complex scalar field whose phase is the axion .",
    "a single additional scalar field is needed to stabilize the two independent distances between the pairs of branes . from a low energy perspective",
    ", this field produces an effective potential which breaks the necessity to tune the potentials for the two radion parameters to be flat .",
    "this stabilization only requires a very mild tuning to ensure that the complex scalar does not disrupt the mechanism .",
    "the resulting radions have masses of the order of the @xmath5 breaking scale and near the electroweak scale respectively .",
    "while the invisible axion is not the only solution to the strong cp problem in extra dimensional scenarios  for example the qcd gauge fields could be promoted to bulk fields @xcite  it provides an intriguing example of a warped geometry with multiple scales exponentially below the planck mass .",
    "more generally , the existence of intermediate scales allows the possibility of a hidden sector which is naturally suppressed by a large , but not - planckian , mass .",
    "it would also be interesting to understand the origin of multiple mass scales from the perspective of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite ."
