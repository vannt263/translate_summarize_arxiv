    "the most fundamental element in communications is a task in which for a receiver ( bob ) discriminates among different physical entities sent by a sender ( alice ) . in general , however , different quantum states can not be discriminated with certainty because of non - orthogonality .",
    "interestingly , this fundamental limit makes quantum communication more intriguing and more useful in some cases @xcite .",
    "let us consider the task .",
    "if the number of entities is a finite number @xmath0 , the task is normally called quantum state discrimination ( qsd ) @xcite .",
    "if the number of entities is infinite and continuous , it is called quantum state estimation ( qse ) @xcite .",
    "qsd maximizes the probability of correct guessing for the entity . in qse , however , the probability of correct guessing is zero because the number of entities is infinite , and thus is a meaningless quantity .",
    "hence a function ( a figure of merit ) is introduced which assigns a score for the pair of a state sent by alice and a state guessed by bob .",
    "normally the figure of merit is monotonous , that is , as the two states are closer , the score is higher .",
    "the average score is optimized .",
    "now let us consider the qsd in the context of a figure of merit . in the normal qsd ,",
    "only those events in which bob makes a correct guess are counted .",
    "qsd does not consider how close the guessed one is to the correct one .",
    "here we can generalize the qsd , by introducing a function , the figure of merit , which assigns a score for the pair of a correct state and a guessed one .",
    "we maximize the average score as in qse . as we see , normal qsd is a special case of `` qsd with general figures of merit '' .",
    "( `` qsd with general figures of merit '' is equivalent to `` qse with discrete set of states '' . )",
    "recently it has been shown that the no - signaling ( no superluminal communication ) principle can greatly simplify analysis in quantum information @xcite including analysis of qsd @xcite and qse @xcite . in this paper , we consider the problem of the `` qsd with general figures of merit '' , for an even number @xmath1 , of symmetric states of quantum bits ( qubits ) , with use of the no - signaling principle . here both methods used for qsd @xcite and qse @xcite are combined to get solutions .",
    "it turns out that optimal measurements are the same for all monotonous ( symmetric ) figures of merit in qsd .",
    "it is true that the no - signaling principle is not essential in our argument .",
    "that is , `` no - signaling principle '' can be replaced by `` impossibility of discriminating two different decompositions of states corresponding to the same density operator '' in refs .",
    "@xcite and throughout this paper .",
    "however , we adopt the no - signaling principle here because it makes the result more concrete .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a set of symmetric ( mixed ) qubit states .",
    "we show that with use of the no - signaling principle , conditional probability in qsd for the symmetric set always has the form @xmath2 for any ( symmetric ) figure of merit . here",
    "@xmath3 are constants and @xmath4 is determined by the bloch vectors of the prepared qubit and the guessed qubit .",
    "we also bound the conditional probability with use of the no - signaling principle again .",
    "we observe that the function giving the maximal score is realized by a simple symmetric measurement , which is just the optimal measurement in normal qsd .",
    "thus the measurement becomes an optimal measurement in qsd with any monotonous figure of merit .",
    "let us give a description of qsd . in this paper",
    ", @xmath5 denotes the situation in which @xmath0 different quantum states @xmath6 are generated with probability @xmath7 by alice , where @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is a conditional probability that an output @xmath10 is given for an input @xmath11 by certain optimal measurements of bob . here",
    "the guessing probability denotes the maximal probability of correct guessing : @xmath13 where maximization is done over measurements . in the normal qsd ,",
    "the guessing probability is maximized ( or , equivalently , error probability is minimized ) .",
    "however , we can generalize qsd by introducing a figure of merit , a function @xmath14 .",
    "the average score is maximized : @xmath15 in this paper we consider only symmetric figures of merit .",
    "that is , we assume that @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( mod @xmath0 ) for each @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the normal qsd corresponds to a case where @xmath20 .",
    "here @xmath21 when @xmath22 and @xmath23 when @xmath24 .",
    "then let us describe bloch representation @xcite in which any qubit state can be expressed as @xmath25 here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are pauli operators .",
    "@xmath29 for pure states and @xmath30 for mixed states .",
    "an even number @xmath31 of symmetric qubit states to be discriminated can be parameterized as ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) ,     denotes @xmath32 which is bloch vector of qubits to be discriminated .",
    "@xmath6 s are symmetrically oriented.,width=340 ]     is projected on xy plane to be @xmath33.,width=340 ]    @xmath34    here @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "we consider only the symmetric case where @xmath7 are all equal , and @xmath37 .",
    "let us consider a communication scenario in which qsd is incorporated @xcite .",
    "_ proposition 1_. if two different decompositions of states corresponding to the same density operator can be discriminated , superluminal communication can be achieved between two parties sharing appropriate entangled states : assume that alice and bob are sharing an ensemble of entangled states .",
    "in this case bob s reduced density operator @xmath38 is fixed . consider two different decompositions of states @xmath39 and @xmath40 corresponding to the @xmath38 .",
    "( here @xmath41 and @xmath42 . )",
    "that is , @xmath43 . by the gisin - hughston - jozsa - wootters theorem @xcite ,",
    "however , alice can generate any decomposition she wants by performing an appropriate measurement .",
    "that is , there exists a measurement @xmath44 ( the other measurement @xmath45 ) such that if alice performs @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) on her quantum states then a decomposition @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is generated at bob s site .",
    "they can communicate as follows .",
    "if alice wants to send a bit @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , she performs @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "@xmath48    now let us consider a decomposition , @xmath49 that corresponds to a density operator @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "by a simple geometric argument , we can find a @xmath53 such that @xmath54 an angle between @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the projected plane is @xmath57 .",
    "now we get @xmath58 by eqs .",
    "( [ a ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , clearly we have @xmath59 on the other hand , suppose we have a device for qsd , a `` state discriminator '' . here for a moment we neither specify a figure of merit nor require that the state discriminator is an optimal one . however , we assume that the state discriminator has symmetry , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( mod @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is not that all state discriminators should be symmetric even if the input states has symmetry as in our case .",
    "consider a ( useless ) state discriminator that always gives a fixed output @xmath46 for any input , which is clearly not symmetric .",
    "however , as we show below , for any asymmetric state discriminator there exists a symmetric one whose score is the same as the score of the asymmetric one .",
    "hence it is sufficient for us to consider only symmetric one because our goal is to find optimal state discriminator .",
    "now let us show that , for any asymmetric state discriminator , there exists a symmetric state discriminator whose score is the same as the one by the asymmetric one .",
    "let us denote conditional probabilities of the asymmetric one by @xmath9 , which gives a score @xmath62 let us consider a symmetric one with @xmath63 we can see that score by @xmath64 is the same as score by @xmath9 : @xmath65 here symmetry of the figure of merits is used to get second equality .",
    "the state discriminator we consider is a `` black box , '' which can include quantum measurement device and anything else helpful for the task . for a certain input state @xmath6 ,",
    "the state discriminator will give an output @xmath10 as the optimal guess .",
    "now let us consider the left - hand and right - hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) as the two different decompositions in the context of proposition 1 . by the no - signaling principle and proposition 1",
    ", the two decompositions can not be discriminated by any means .",
    "therefore the two decompositions can not be discriminated by the state discriminator . for an output 0 , this implies @xmath66 by linearity of quantum mechanics .",
    "here @xmath67 and @xmath68 are constants and thus they can be set to be @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively . by symmetry , we have @xmath71 . from eqs .",
    "( [ d-2 ] ) and ( [ f ] ) , @xmath72 by setting @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 . by symmetry , we have , for each @xmath11 and @xmath10 , @xmath76 note that a state discriminator with \\{@xmath77 } and another with \\{@xmath78 } can be interconverted to each other by simply re - labeling the output , @xmath79 , so they are equivalent to each other .",
    "therefore , we confine ourselves to the case @xmath80 without loss of generality .",
    "we can see that as @xmath81 becomes larger , the function becomes narrower . here",
    "@xmath82 is the minimal one between @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the case when @xmath83 and @xmath84 gives maximal information .",
    "conditional probability of this case also gives maximal score . in the case of pure states ,",
    "the optimal conditional probability is achieved by the uniform measurement , which thus becomes an optimal measurement @xcite . in our case , however , we can expect that the conditional probability would have a more broad form because the states to be discriminated are mixed states and thus more nonorthogonal .      before we discuss how to get the more broad one ,",
    "let us refresh qsd by the no - signaling principle .",
    "here what we need to do first is to construct a set of states @xmath85 such that @xmath86 for all @xmath18 s and @xmath87 _ proposition-2 _ @xcite . from the no - signaling principle , the guessing probability in any state discriminator",
    "must be bounded as @xmath88 assume that alice and bob are sharing an ensemble of an entangled state for which @xmath89 . by the theorem of gisin - hughston - jozsa - wootters @xcite",
    ", alice can generate any decomposition , @xmath90 that she wants at bob s site .",
    "now let @xmath91 be the conditional probability that an output @xmath10 is given by a state discriminator when @xmath92 is generated .",
    "note that the state discriminator gives a certain output even when @xmath85 is input .",
    "hence we have @xmath93 . by the no - signaling principle",
    ", we have @xmath94 for all @xmath95 . here",
    "thus we have @xmath97 . by combining eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) and the above equations , we have @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath48    now let us derive bounds on the conditional probability by using proposition 2 . in our case",
    "in which all @xmath7 s are the same , all @xmath99 s are the same by eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) .",
    "the bound reduces to @xmath100 when @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath102 in our case is calculated as @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "thus the bound is @xmath104 note that eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) is valid for any state discriminator .",
    "one may say that eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) is bound for normal qsd . however , the state discriminator made for any figure of merit can also work for normal qsd .",
    "now we can see that by some calculations including normalization for @xmath105 and @xmath106 , if the function in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) becomes narrower than @xmath107 then the function violates the bound in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) .",
    "hence the conditional probability @xmath108 can not be narrower than @xmath109 .",
    "namely , possible ranges are @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "thus @xmath109 is the optimal conditional probability in our case .",
    "all results so far are valid for any figure of merit since we have not specified a figure of merit yet .",
    "remarkably , conditional probability has the same form in eq ( [ h ] ) for any figure of merit .",
    "now let us consider a specific figure of merit .",
    "we can say that almost ( useful ) figure of merit should have monotonicity : the figure of merit increases with decreasing @xmath112 .",
    "provided that the monotonicity is satisfied , the function @xmath109 gives the highest average score .",
    "now if we find a measurement that realize the function @xmath109 , the measurement becomes an optimal one .",
    "now let us discuss how the function @xmath109 is achieved .",
    "let us try the optimal measurement in the normal qsd for our states .",
    "the optimal measurement is a symmetric one whose positive operator - valued measure ( povm , @xcite ) is @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a unit vector in the @xmath115 plane . after direct calculation",
    ", we can see that the measurement gives the function @xmath109 .",
    "hence the measurement by eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) is an optimal measurement for a state discriminator with monotonous figure of merits , and the function @xmath109 is the corresponding optimal conditional probability .",
    "the result applies to any ( symmetric ) black box which gives an outcome @xmath10 for the input states @xmath6 with fixed conditional probability @xmath9 , regardless of whether the black - box is made for state discrimination .",
    "that is , conditional probability of any such black box must have the form in eq . ( [ h ] ) .    in some cases like in the case of information gain @xcite",
    ", the score can not be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "however , the result here is applicable . as discussed above",
    ", conditional probability has the form in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .",
    "a conditional probability within allowed range of @xmath105 , which maximize the score , is the optimal one . in the case of information",
    "gain the optimal one should be one with maximal @xmath105 .",
    "we considered qsd with general ( symmetric ) figure of merit .",
    "we first solved the problem for an even number of symmetric qubits with use of the no - signaling principle . here both methods used for qsd @xcite and qse @xcite are combined to get the solutions .",
    "we showed that , with use of the no - signaling principle , conditional probability always has the form @xmath2 .",
    "we tightened the range for the conditional probability with use of the no - signaling principle again .",
    "remarkably , these results are valid for any ( symmetric ) figure of merit .",
    "the optimal conditional probability @xmath109 is achieved by a simple symmetric measurement .",
    "therefore , the measurement is the optimal one for our case .",
