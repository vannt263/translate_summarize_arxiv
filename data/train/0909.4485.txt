    "infectious diseases are constrained to spread along the contacts of a population .",
    "mathematical models investigating epidemics typically assume that the contacts occur through mass action mixing  @xcite .",
    "however true populations violate some mass - action assumptions in a manner affecting the epidemic dynamics . recently a number of investigations have been performed using random networks  @xcite which allow for a better accounting of mixing in the population .    unlike mass - action models ,",
    "random networks allow for the number of contacts individuals have to remain bounded as the population size increases . thus once an individual infects a contact , the number of available contacts to infect decreases by a non - negligible amount .",
    "random networks also allow for more accurate representation of heterogeneities in the number of contacts compared with mass - action models . in a population with heterogeneous contact levels , individuals with more contacts",
    "are preferentially infected early in the epidemic ( and in turn cause more infections ) , while at the end of the epidemic the remaining susceptibles tend to have fewer contacts .",
    "a number of analytic results have been found for epidemic probability or size in random networks , but with only a few exceptions ( notably  @xcite ) , no analytic attention has been paid to the dynamics of the growth in networks .",
    "however , some attempts have been made using _",
    "pair approximations _ which track the number of joined pairs of individuals with @xmath0 contacts and @xmath1 contacts in each infection state  @xcite ( assuming infection and recovery occur at constant rates ) . for a network with @xmath2 different degrees , such a model results in @xmath3 coupled differential equations .",
    "recent work by  @xcite has shown that it is possible to investigate the dynamics of epidemic spread on configuration model networks ( described below ) using a coupled system of only three odes ( again assuming infection and recovery occur at constant rates ) .",
    "the resulting system has many nonlinear terms , but the number of equations does not grow with the number of different degrees . in this note",
    "we derive a single differential equation that can capture the dynamics with only a single higher order term . the framework we develop to calculate the dynamics can also be applied to predicting the final size of an epidemic in a concise way .",
    "we reproduce earlier results in this context .    although our results are equivalent to pre - existing results , we place previous calculations of epidemic size and epidemic dynamics into a common framework .",
    "the equations we derive are simpler , and the terms in the equations are more easily interpreted .",
    "the resulting calculations for the numbers of susceptible , infected , and recovered individuals are of comparable complexity to the standard mass - action @xmath4 equations , but allow for more realistic population interactions .    in section  [ sec : framework ]",
    "we develop the framework for the later sections . in section  [ sec : dynamics ] we apply this framework to calculating the time course of an epidemic . in section  [ sec : finalsize ] we apply this framework to calculating the final size of an epidemic . finally in section  [",
    "sec : discuss ] we discuss the significance of these calculations .",
    "we represent the population by a network .",
    "each individual is thought of as a node joined to other nodes by edges through which disease can spread .",
    "we use configuration model ( cm ) networks  @xcite to model the population . to generate a cm network , the _ degree _ or number of edges of each node , @xmath5 ,",
    "is assigned with probability @xmath6 based on a given degree distribution .",
    "if the sum of degrees is odd , all degrees are reassigned until the sum is even .",
    "then each node is placed into a list with repetition equal to its degree , the list is randomized , and each node in position @xmath7 ( @xmath8 )",
    "is connected with the node in position @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting network constitutes a uniform choice from the networks with the given degree distribution . in general",
    "the network may have self - loops or repeated edges . for degree distributions with finite mean ,",
    "the impact of this effect is negligible in sufficiently large networks and we ignore it .",
    "we define @xmath10 the probability generating function of the degree distribution .",
    "note that @xmath11 is the average degree .",
    "an example cm network is shown in figure  [ fig : sample ] .",
    "for many important distributions , @xmath12 takes a simple form ; for example , a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath13 has @xmath14",
    ".     nodes .",
    "the degree distribution is chosen such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "thus @xmath17 . ]",
    "nodes in the network are assigned to one of three classes : susceptible , infected , or recovered .",
    "we denote the fraction of the population in each class by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "a susceptible node becomes infected at rate @xmath21 where @xmath2 is the number of infected neighbors it has .",
    "once infected , a node recovers at rate @xmath22 .",
    "a recovered node plays no further role in the spread .",
    "typically an outbreak is initiated with a single randomly chosen infected indvidual in an otherwise susceptible population .",
    "we define an _ infectious contact _ from @xmath23 to its neighbor @xmath24 to be a contact when @xmath23 is infectious that would cause infection of @xmath24 if @xmath24 were susceptible .",
    "physically this is the transmission of an infectious dose from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "an individual can cause infectious contact only when infected .",
    "however , an individual can receive an infectious contact regardless of his / her state , and so an infectious contact does not necessarily lead to infection .",
    "we use @xmath25 as a measure of the probability that a random edge has not transmitted an infectious contact .",
    "its precise definition is subtle , but important . to define @xmath25 , we choose an edge uniformly from all edges .",
    "we then choose a direction for that edge , say from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "we refer to @xmath23 as the _ base _ and @xmath24 as the _ target_. we modify the spread of the disease by disallowing infectious contacts from @xmath24 to @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath26 is the probability that there is never an infectious contact from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , while @xmath27 is the probability that at time @xmath28 there has not been infectious contact from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "if we did not disallow infection from the target then an infection of @xmath24 from some other source would in turn make infection of @xmath23 more likely , which in turn makes infectious contact from @xmath23 to @xmath24 more likely , and so transmission along different edges to the same target would not be independent , thereby complicating the analysis .    under the assumption that the spread is deterministic , the cumulative size of an epidemic at a given time is equal to the probability",
    "a randomly chosen node has been infected . disallowing infection from that single randomly chosen",
    "node may impact the dynamics _",
    "after _ that node is infected , but it does not modify the probability that that single node has become infected .",
    "consequently , to calculate the size at a given time , it suffices to calculate the probability a randomly chosen node that can not infect its neighbors has been infected , or alternately , is still susceptible .",
    "to calculate the dynamics , we calculate the fraction of the population that has not yet been infected . to do this ,",
    "we look at the probability that a randomly chosen node is not yet infected at time @xmath28 . we choose a random target @xmath24 and disallow infection from @xmath24 to all of its neighbors . using @xmath25 as defined above , if the degree of @xmath24 is @xmath5 , then the probability that @xmath24 is still susceptible is @xmath29 .",
    "thus the fraction of susceptibles is @xmath30    to calculate the rate of change of @xmath25 , we will need to know how many of those edges that have not transmitted an infectious contact have the opportunity to transmit infection at any given time .",
    "that is , we need to know what proportion of all edges have not had an infectious contact but come from an infected base node .",
    "we set @xmath31 to be the probability that the base node of an edge is infected but the edge has not transmitted infection ( assuming as for @xmath25 that the target node does not cause infection ) .",
    "those edges which satisfy the definition for @xmath31 are a subset of those which satisfy the definition for @xmath25 .",
    "we derive coupled differential equations for @xmath25 and @xmath31 .",
    "the rate of change in the probability a random edge has not transmitted infection is equal to the rate at which infection crosses edges @xmath32 an edge no longer satisfies the definition for @xmath31 when infection crosses the edge or when the base node recovers .",
    "an edge from @xmath23 to @xmath24 begins to satisfy the definition if @xmath23 becomes infectious .",
    "the rate at which neighbors become infectious matches the rate at which neighbors stop being susceptible .",
    "we use @xmath33 to denote the probability that a neighbor is susceptible , so @xmath34 .",
    "we now find @xmath33 .",
    "a node is more likely to be a neighbor if it has more contacts  @xcite , and so the probability the neighbor has degree @xmath5 is @xmath35 .",
    "the neighbor can only be infected by an edge other than the one from the target node .",
    "thus @xmath36 thus the neighbor becomes infectious at rate @xmath37 .",
    "we finally get @xmath38 \\phi \\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : phi}\\ ] ] in fact , we can integrate this equation using   to get @xmath39 the term @xmath40 represents the probability the edge has transmitted an infectious contact , the term @xmath41 represents the probability that the base node has been infected but recovered without an infectious contact , and @xmath42 represents the probability that the base node is still susceptible .",
    "the complement of all such edges is exactly those edges which have not transmitted infection but connect to an infected base node .",
    "consequently we arrive at @xmath43    the epidemiological quantity of interest is only rarely the proportion of edges which have or have not transmitted infection , but rather it is usually the values of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "we can calculate @xmath44 directly .",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath45 , and conservation of individuals gives @xmath46 .",
    "consequently , we can augment   with @xmath47 to find @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .    in order to solve our equations",
    ", we need to find appropriate initial conditions . at the earliest stages ,",
    "the outbreak grows stochastically , and so the deterministic equations are not yet appropriate .",
    "if an epidemic occurs , eventually the outbreak infects a large number of nodes and then behaves effectively deterministically . in a sufficiently large population",
    "we can assume that deterministic behavior begins while the proportion infected is still small compared to the population .",
    "once the stochastic phase is over , we have @xmath48 with @xmath49 . at early time",
    "@xmath50 $ ] unless @xmath51 is infinite ( which corresponds to an infinite variance in the degree distribution such as occurs in some power - law distributions ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume the @xmath51 is finite ( if it were not , growth would not be exponential initially and this calculation would require more attention ) .",
    "we define @xmath52 to correspond to a time when the epidemic is sufficiently large that the outbreak proceeds deterministically , but the proportion affected is still small . from the value of @xmath25",
    "we can easily calculate @xmath53 , and thus we can also calculate @xmath54 .    to distinguish the number of current infections ( @xmath19 ) from recovered infections ( @xmath20 ) requires somewhat more effort . to find the early behavior for @xmath20 , we note that @xmath19 and @xmath55 are linearly related at early time , so that @xmath56 $ ]",

    "combined with @xmath59 this gives @xmath20 at @xmath52 .",
