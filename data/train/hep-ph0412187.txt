    "potential models , in particular semirelativistic ones , have been proved extremely successful for the description of mesons and baryons @xcite .",
    "several technics have been developed in order to solve numerically the spinless salpeter equation used in most works devoted to the study of light mesons .",
    "variational calculations performed in well chosen bases @xcite , and the three - dimensional fourier grid hamiltonian method @xcite , for instance , can provide accurate numerical results .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to obtain analytical results as well . the dominantly orbital state ( dos ) description has been developed in this direction @xcite . in this approach , the orbitally excited states are obtained as a classical result while the radially excited states can be treated semiclassically .",
    "it is then possible to obtain information about family of states characterized by a high orbital angular momentum .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dos model has been applied to study light - light and heavy - light meson spectra with a confinement potential being a mixture of scalar and vector components . in the case of one or two quarks with vanishing masses",
    ", it was shown that linear regge ( orbital ) and vibrational ( radial ) trajectories are obtained for an arbitrary scalar - vector mixture but that the ratio of radial to orbital energies is strongly dependent on the mixture .",
    "these results have been extended in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering the presence of a quark and an antiquark with finite identical masses and the introduction of a coulomb - like interaction plus a constant potential in addition to the confinement . in the limit of small masses and small strength of the short range potential , or in the limit of large angular momentum",
    ", it is shown that all calculations can be worked out analytically .",
    "one result is that slopes of orbital and radial trajectories depend only on the string tension and on the vector - scalar mixture in the confinement potential .",
    "moreover , small finite quark masses do not alter significantly the linearity , specially in the case of dominant vector - type confining potential .",
    "as expected , the coulomb - like potential has no effect on trajectories but its influence on the meson masses is determined in the approximation of the dos description .",
    "lastly , it is shown that the ratio of radial to orbital trajectory slopes depends on the scalar - vector confinement mixture only .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the case of a quark and an antiquark with finite but different masses .",
    "the potential taken into account is the same as the one considered in our previous work , that is to say a linear scalar - vector mixed confinement potential supplemented by a coulomb - like interaction .",
    "an expression for the square mass of a meson is obtained in the limit of small quark masses and small strength of the short range potential , or in the limit of large angular momentum .",
    "the coefficients of the square mass formula can not be obtained analytically but they are computed numerically . nevertheless a coverage of all possible situations is performed .",
    "the square mass formula is established and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] respectively .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : rem ] .",
    "a detailed explanation of the technique of the dos description is given in ref .",
    "so we just recall the basic ideas and we only focus on differences between our work and previous ones . in all our formulas",
    ", we use the natural units @xmath0 .",
    "we consider a system composed of two particles with masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 interacting via a scalar potential @xmath3 and a vector potential @xmath4 which depend only on the distance @xmath5 between the particles . in the center - of - mass laboratory ,",
    "the classical mass @xmath6 of the system characterized by a total orbital angular momentum @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radial internal momentum .",
    "the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 indicate how the scalar potential @xmath3 is shared among the two masses .",
    "these quantities must satisfy the following conditions to ensure a good nonrelativistic limit : @xmath12 a natural choice is to take @xmath13 we will use this prescription in this work . in the following , it is assumed that @xmath14 .",
    "a parameter @xmath15 is introduced to measure the mass asymmetry , and the heaviest quark mass is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "contrary to the philosophy adopted in our previous paper @xcite , it is necessary to work with the hamiltonian formalism and to give up the lagrangian formalism .",
    "the idea of the dos description is to make a classical approximation by considering uniquely the classical circular orbits , that is to say the lowest energy states with a given @xmath7 .",
    "this state is defined by @xmath17 , and thus @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "let us denote @xmath20 .",
    "in order to get the radial excitations , a harmonic approximation around a classical circular orbits is calculated .",
    "if the harmonic quantum energy is given by @xmath21 , then the square mass of the system with orbital excitation @xmath7 and radial excitation @xmath22(0,1 ,  ) is given by ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath23 the harmonic approximation is relevant only if it can be assumed that @xmath24 .",
    "we will see in the next section that the last formula will be naturally obtained in the light meson case studied in this paper .      as it is done in previous works ,",
    "this formalism is applied to the study of mesons .",
    "the long range part of the interaction between a quark and an antiquark is dominated by the confinement which is assumed to be a linear function of @xmath5 .",
    "as its lorentz structure is not yet determined , we assume that the confinement is partly scalar and partly vector .",
    "the importance of each part is fixed by a mixing parameter @xmath25 whose value is 0 for a pure vector and 1 for a pure scalar .",
    "the short range part of the interaction is assumed to be of vector - type and given by the usual coulomb - like potential .",
    "thus we have @xmath26 in which @xmath27 is the usual string tension , whose value should be around 0.2 gev@xmath28 , and @xmath29 in which @xmath30 is proportional to the strong coupling constant @xmath31 . a reasonable value of @xmath30 should be in the range 0.1 to 0.6 .",
    "the quark masses appearing in a spinless salpeter equation are the constituent masses .",
    "their values are model dependent , but generally we have @xmath32 gev and @xmath33 gev .",
    "we are interested only in regge trajectories which give the behavior of @xmath34 in term of @xmath7 for large value of @xmath7 .",
    "so to compute the square mass formula for the particular interaction ( [ sr])-([vr ] ) , we will use the same technique as in our previous study .",
    "a detailed explanation is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a given set of parameters @xmath25 and @xmath35",
    ", we have to compute the value of @xmath36 as a function of @xmath7 , in the limit of great values of @xmath7 . in the general case",
    ", this radius is given by a polynomial equation of 20th degree .",
    "this equation is by no mean obvious to obtain and can not be considered as a simple extension of the two equal mass case .",
    "the software mathematica has been used to perform the longest calculations .",
    "the general formulas are very complicated and too long to be given in detail here , but they can be obtained on request .    when @xmath37 , the old formalism must be recovered .",
    "this is not trivial to demonstrate , but we have verified this point . in particular , when the two particles have the same mass , the degree of the general polynomial is reduced and the solution is one of the root of a second degree equation . in this case , the determination of @xmath36 and all subsequent calculations can be performed analytically and are identical of the ones performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when @xmath35 is different from 1 , a numerical solution for @xmath36 must be computed numerically for each value of parameters @xmath25 and @xmath35 .",
    "note that when @xmath38 , only one relevant solution ( @xmath36 real positive ) exists ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to find the physical relevant value of @xmath36",
    ", we generate the solutions for increasing values of @xmath25 from the known solution at @xmath38 , in order to be sure that the solution is a continuous function of @xmath25 .",
    "this procedure is repeated for each value of @xmath35 .",
    "once the radius is calculated , its value is used to compute the square meson mass .",
    "finally , we obtain the square mass of the meson under the following form @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath16 is the mass of the heaviest quark .",
    "the values of coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 as a function of the mixing parameter @xmath25 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath35 are given in figs .",
    "[ fig : a ] .",
    "all coefficients are discussed in the next section .",
    "it is worth noting that the term in @xmath44 naturally does not appear as it is of higher order .",
    "when @xmath37 , that is to say @xmath45 , formula ( [ m2 ] ) reduces to formula  ( 20 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , and coefficients @xmath42 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath43 are given by analytical expressions which can be found in this reference .",
    "we checked theoretically as well as numerically that our new expressions tend towards the previous ones at the limit @xmath49 .",
    "equation  ( [ m2 ] ) is the square mass of a meson for large value of @xmath7 .",
    "though coefficients of the formula can not be obtained analytically , they are calculated for @xmath40 and for @xmath41 , which covers all possible physical situations provided the mass @xmath16 appearing in the formula is the mass of the heaviest quark .",
    "one can make the following comments .    for large value of @xmath7 , the dominant term of the square mass formula is linear in @xmath7 .",
    "this explains the existence of linear regge trajectories .",
    "the slope of the regge trajectories depend on three parameters : the string tension @xmath27 , the mixing parameter @xmath25 and the mass asymmetry parameter @xmath35 .",
    "the string tension is a constant and gives the energy scale of the slope .",
    "the slope depends strongly on the value of @xmath25 , which is assumed to be also an universal quantity independent of the system .",
    "unfortunately , as we have seen in our previous work @xcite , experimental data from symmetrical mesons ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 families ) can not provide reliable information about the value of @xmath25 .",
    "the calculations favor slightly a dominant vector - type confining interaction ( @xmath38 ) . but",
    "this work shows that the slope depends also on the parameter @xmath35 whose values is fixed by the system . on fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] , one can see that the @xmath35-dependence of the coefficient @xmath52 is only marked when @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it is also shown in our previous work @xcite that the conclusions we can obtain from our square mass formula can be applied to light mesons only , that is to say mesons containing @xmath55 , @xmath56 or @xmath57 quarks . in this case , the only physical relevant value for @xmath35 is given by the ratio @xmath58 . for constituent masses",
    ", the value of this ratio must be around 0.5 .",
    "this shows that the slope of the regge trajectory for @xmath59 mesons can not be sensitively different from the ones for @xmath50 and @xmath51 mesons .",
    "this is specially verified if the confinement potential is dominantly of vector - type ( @xmath60 ) as it seems favored from experimental data .",
    "one can see on fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] that the slope of the vibrational trajectories proportional to @xmath61 presents the same characteristics as the coefficient @xmath52 .",
    "we can conclude that the slope of the vibrational trajectory for @xmath59 mesons can not be sensitively different from the ones for @xmath50 and @xmath51 mesons .",
    "obviously , the ratio @xmath62 is characterized by a similar behavior as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath35 .",
    "a term proportional to @xmath63 deforms the regge trajectories for low value of @xmath7 .",
    "this term vanishes if @xmath64 , that is to say the two quarks are massless , or if @xmath65 , that is to say the lightest quark is massless .",
    "so , the linearity of the regge trajectory is perfect if one quark is massless .",
    "this is also the case if the confinement potential is a pure vector - type interaction ( @xmath38 ) whatever the masses are .",
    "the value of @xmath66 decreases rapidly with @xmath25 and @xmath35 value parameters .",
    "this fact implies that the linearity of the regge trajectory is only broken in the case of dominantly scalar - type confinement interaction . as it is mentioned above",
    ", this situation is not the one favored by experimental data .",
    "note that the term proportional to @xmath63 is also independent of the strong coupling constant @xmath30 .",
    "the position of the trajectories with respect to the energy axe stems from three contributions ; one @xmath67 is due to the finite mass the quarks , another negative one @xmath68 is due to the strong coupling constant and the last one @xmath69 reflects the zero point motion of the harmonic vibration .",
    "these terms are of minor importance since the zero point energy of the orbital motion can not obviously be calculated in our model .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to discuss a little bit the behavior of coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath70 depends clearly on @xmath35 whatever the value of @xmath25 . when @xmath38 , this coefficient can be calculated exactly : @xmath71 .",
    "this term is linked to the contribution of the quark masses to the meson total mass .",
    "the presence of the coulomb - like potential decreases the mass of the meson but has no influence on the regge trajectories , as it is expected for a potential which becomes very weak with respect to the confinement interaction as quark interdistance increases . again",
    "the coefficient @xmath72 is only affected by the mass asymmetry for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "finally , let us remark that there is no coupling between orbital and radial motion for large @xmath7 values ( absence of terms @xmath73 ) .",
    "this is only a consequence of the coulomb+linear nature of the quark - antiquark potential",
    ". this may not be true for other types of potentials .",
    "we have shown that all light mesons exhibit linear orbital and radial trajectories in the dominantly orbital states ( dos ) model .",
    "slopes of both type of trajectories depend only on the string tension , the vector - scalar mixture in the confinement potential and the mass asymmetry between the quark and the antiquark .    in the limit of small quark masses",
    ", it turns out that the mass asymmetry between the quark and the antiquark alters sensitively the slope of the trajectories only for large mass asymmetry and for dominant scalar - type confining potential .",
    "as the experimental data favor a vector - type confining potential ( see our previous paper @xcite ) and as the mass ratio of non - strange quark over the strange quark is not very small , the slope of the regge and vibrational trajectory for @xmath59 mesons can not be sensitively different from the ones for @xmath50 and @xmath51 mesons .",
    "this is in agreement with experimental meson spectra .",
