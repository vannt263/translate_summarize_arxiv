    "hydrophobic interactions are important in structural biology and nanoscience where they are often the major driving force in self - assembly .",
    "@xcite for example , hydrophobic interactions are acknowledged to play a major role in the formation and folding of proteins .",
    "@xcite a classic example of hydrophobic assembly is when two plates that bear little attraction to water are separated by less than some critical separation , capillary evaporation occurs in the inter - plate region , thereby driving association .",
    "although a great deal of work has concentrated on the structural and thermodynamic aspects of hydrophobic assembly , less is known about the kinetic mechanisms involved in the association process .",
    "prior studies have investigated the rate of evaporation of solvent confined between two hydrophobic surfaces ,  @xcite although the full association pathway remains largely unexplored .",
    "one possible route to modeling the kinetics is within the framework of brownian ( smoluchowski ) dynamics , a coarse grained description in which the solvent degrees of freedom are not explicitly treated and where the dynamics of the heavy bodies are instead modeled in a stochastic bath .",
    "the effect of solvent is encoded in the potential of mean force ( pmf ) between bodies and the friction coefficient . if hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) are included , then the friction coefficients depend on the positions of the heavy bodies . within this framework",
    ", one can simulate protein diffusion and association using the appropriate equations together with the potential of mean force and the ( position dependent ) friction tensor as input .",
    "@xcite for example , such an approach has been utilized to study crowded cellular environments , where the diffusion of proteins is thought to slow down considerably due in part to hydrodynamic interactions .  @xcite    most typically , hydrodynamic interactions that are utilized in brownian dynamics simulation are computed within a continuum description of the solvent .",
    "@xcite this description , however breaks down for inter - particle length scales of 1 - 2 nm .",
    "@xcite on such length scales , fluctuations which accompany solvent layering or capillary drying could have an enormous effect on hydrodynamic interactions . in recent work ,",
    "we have shown how the nature of solvent confined between nanoscopic spheres determines the role of hi in assembly .",
    "@xcite there is a growing interest in the behavior of water molecules in confined geometries .",
    "@xcite the diffusion constant and the hydrogen bond lifetime of water molecules in confined environments are distinct from those in the bulk .",
    "@xcite furthermore , similar signatures have been recently observed in simulations of crowded protein solutions .",
    "@xcite we believe such effects can potentially play an important role in the transport and association of nanoscopic bodies .    in this paper , we extend our previous study of nanospheres to the study of hydrodynamic interactions and association kinetics of plates of varying hydrophobicity .",
    "we calculate the friction on two parallel plates as a function of their separation from molecular dynamic simulations with explicit water using a technique previously employed for spherical solutes .",
    "@xcite we also calculate the potential of mean force between the two plates as a function of their separation .",
    "both the molecular - scale effects of hydrodynamic interactions and the free energy profile are found to be highly correlated with the behavior of water molecules in the inter - plate region , in agreement with our prior work .",
    "@xcite    we presently consider three types of graphene - like plates : plates with a `` fully '' attractive solute - solvent interaction potential , plates with a `` reduced '' attractive solute - solvent potential , and plates with a purely repulsive solute - solvent potential . for the plates with either a reduced attractive potential or a purely repulsive potential , capillary evaporation occurs when the inter - plate separation is smaller than a critical value .",
    "in contrast , capillary evaporation does not occur for plates with a fully attractive solute - solvent potential .",
    "as the fully attractive plates approach each other , we observe solvent layering with water molecules being eventually expelled from the inter - plate region due to steric repulsion .",
    "both dewetting in the former cases and solvent layering in the latter case greatly affect the solvent fluctuations in the inter - plate region and give rise to molecular scale effects in the hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "we compute the spatial dependence of the friction tensor and investigate the relation between the static and dynamic fluctuations of water density in the inter - plate region and this property .    given the potential of mean force and position dependent friction coefficient we compute the rate of diffusion controlled association by means of brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulations .",
    "the predictions of bd are tested against the results garnered from a set of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of assembly in explicit solvent .",
    "this serves as a test of the validity of the markovian approximation inherent in brownian dynamics simulation , and the ability of coarse - grained stochastic dynamics to adequately capture the kinetic effects associated with the bath .",
    "we find that there is reasonable agreement between the two simulations when molecular scale hydrodynamic interactions are included in the bd , but marked disagreement when hydrodynamic interactions are neglected .",
    "the observation that bd with hydrodynamic interactions is in agreement with the md result is somewhat surprising since , as we show , slow solvent fluctuations play an important role in the assembly process , and we would thus expect non - markovian effects to be of importance .",
    "the agreement between bd and md indicates that the non - markovian effects may be encoded in the spatial dependence of the friction coefficient in an average way .",
    "we modeled the hydrophobic plate as a graphene - like sheet with an area of @xmath0 nm@xmath1 as shown in fig .",
    "the plate size was chosen so as to facilitate both nanometer scale drying transitions and comparison with our prior work on nanospheres . in order to vary the hydrophobicity we studied three types of plates , all with a carbon - carbon bond length of @xmath2 nm , and a lennard - jones diameter of @xmath3 nm but with different interaction potential well depths : ( a ) full lennard - jones ( lj ) interaction with @xmath4 = 0.276 kj / mol ,  @xcite ( b ) reduced lj interaction with @xmath4 = 0.055 kj / mol , and ( c ) purely repulsive weeks - chandler - anderson ( wca ) truncation of the full lj potential  @xcite . for convenience",
    ", these three types of plates are denoted as ( full ) lj plates , reduced lj plates and wca plates in the present work .",
    "solute - solvent interactions are given by the geometric mean of the respective water and solute parameters .    in order to calculate the relative friction coefficient ,",
    "two parallel plates are placed perpendicular to the z - axis and a series of simulations are run with the plates fixed at various separations , and all internal degrees of freedom are frozen .",
    "the inter - plate separation ranges from 0.4 to 2 nm ( for the full and reduced lj plates ) or to 2.2 nm ( for the wca plates ) .",
    "the solvent - induced mean force is computed from such fixed configurations , although a finer grid spacing in @xmath5 is employed . in order to obtain the potential of mean force ( pmf ) , this quantity",

    "snapshots from the association of reduced lj plates and representative trajectories plotted along the reaction coordinate are shown in fig .",
    "the results from these two sets of calculations are discussed in section [ sec : fricresults ] and section [ sec : association ] , respectively .",
    "in addition , we determine the friction coefficient on a single plate , in a system containing only one plate , by pulling it at a constant speed perpendicular to its plane and computing the drag force along its normal direction .",
    "all systems are solvated by tip4p water .",
    "@xcite the size of the solvation box of the full lj and reduced lj system is @xmath13 nm@xmath14 , and for the wca system the box size is increased to @xmath15 nm@xmath14 .",
    "this is done in order to accommodate the large volume fluctuation that arising from the strong dewetting transition .    in the calculation of the friction ,",
    "each system is equilibrated with a 2 ns npt simulation ( p= 1 atm , t = 300 k ) .",

    "double precision routines are utilized for all nve runs . to study the dragging force of the single plate ,",
    "we choose four pulling rates ranging from 0.5 to 3 nm / ns . there are at least 12 npt runs for each pulling rate that are utilized to obtain an accurate estimate of dragging force .",

[ fig2 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this scheme may be utilized to generate predictions for the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) and distribution of first passage times ( dfpt ) from bd simulations with the loading force .",
    "such a comparison serves to evaluate the degree to which the brownian framework can yield an adequate description of the kinetics of assembly .",

    "the mean first passage time obtained from md simulation for the association of the reduced lj plates , is about 60% smaller than the result from bd simulation with hydrodynamic interaction ( bd with hi ) , but 7 times larger than the value estimated from bd when the spatial dependence of the friction is not included and the single plate friction ( see table [ tab : singlefric ] ) is utilized instead ( bd without hi ) .",
    "the fpt distribution obtained from md is also close to , albeit narrower than , that obtained from bd with hi .",
    "in contrast , the distribution garnered from bd without hi is much more strongly peaked . in the case of the wca plates ,",

    "the results of md simulation are in reasonable agreement with those obtained from bd with hi for both the wca and the reduced lj plate systems .",
    "the association process slows down in the region around the critical separation for dewetting transition where the friction peaks . as discussed above",
    ", the behavior of friction profile at the critical separation largely results from the solvent fluctuation due to the dewetting transition .",
    "the molecular - scale effect of hydrodynamic interaction evidently contributes to the slowing down of the association process near the critical separation , and if only barriers present in the pmf are considered ( as in bd without hi ) , association occurs far too rapidly .",
    "these results indicate that a kinetic barrier along the reaction coordinate is present at the drying transition .",
    "[ fig6 ]    the values of the mfpt of the first ( second ) barrier of the full lj plate system as obtained from bd with hi are 1460 ( 23078 ) ps , much larger than the results of 85 ( 243 ) ps for bd without hi .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions strikingly slow down the first passage time over the second barrier by about two orders of magnitude .",

    "for the first barrier , the mfpt obtained from md simulations is smaller than the result from bd with hi , while still being much larger than the result from bd without hi . meanwhile , for the second barrier , the mean first passage time from md simulations is larger than the result from bd simulations with hi .",
    "the distribution of the first passage times corresponding to the second barrier obtained from md simulations is similar to the results from bd simulations with hi . for passage over the first barrier , the distributions exhibit greater deviation .    in general ,",
    "the average value and the distribution of mean first passage times of the three types of plates calculated from md simulations is consistent with the results of bd simulations with hi . in prior work",
    ",  @xcite we found that hydrodynamic interactions contributed approximately 40% to the assembly of two fullerenes . in the present set of calculations ,",
    "hydrodynamic interactions contribute a much larger share .",
    "comparison of spheres and plates indicate that the contribution of the hydrodynamic interaction is enhanced as the shape is flattened .",
    "more water molecules are confined by plates than spheres of the same surface area so that , at small separations , the degree of confinement and the length scale of dewetting is increased .",
    "in this work we study the impact of hydrodynamic effects on the kinetics of assembly of two plates of varying hydrophobicity . to this end",
    ", the potential of mean force and spatially dependent friction coefficient are determined along the inter - plate separation .",
    "the results show that there is a correspondence between peaks in the pmf and peaks in the frictional profile .",
    "high values of the friction are related to large and slow solvent fluctuations in the inter - plate region . both solvent confinement and drying phenomena",
    "can play a critical role in the kinetics of assembly . in this way",
    ", molecular scale effects shape the hydrodynamic interactions , and give rise to their deviation from continuum theory , which predicts that the friction coefficient diverges as two bodies come into contact .",
    "@xcite    the kinetics of assembly studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent with a constant loading force applied along the reaction coordinate is compared with the predictions of brownian dynamics with the same loading force and with the potential of mean force and hydrodynamic profile extracted from the data presented in section [ sec : fricresults ] .",
    "brownian dynamics is a widely used technique owing to its computational efficiency as solvent degrees of freedom are not treated explicitly .",
    "there is reasonable agreement between the mean first passage times that are obtained from the two schemes .",
    "indeed , we find that hydrodynamic interactions are essential to produce a reasonable description of the process and neglect of spatial dependence of the friction has a large impact on the kinetics .",
    "the hi give rise kinetic bottlenecks along the association pathway ,  @xcite over and above the barriers in the potential of mean force .",
    "interestingly , other degrees of freedom such as plate `` rocking '' can in some cases significantly increase the rate of assembly , probably by facilitating waters entry and exit from the inter - plate gap . in order to describe the effect of solvent relaxation on the rocking mode within the brownian framework",
    ", it would require a determination of the friction coefficient experienced on this degree of freedom .",
    "the exploration of all possible pathways to plate assembly is beyond the scope of this work , and presently we concentrate on the approach of two parallel plates .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that including solvent degrees of freedom in the reaction coordinate is necessary in order to properly characterize the association process . presently , a reaction coordinate is utilized that is only a function of the plate degrees of freedom .",
    "we have shown that such a choice is reasonable provided that ( molecular - scale ) hydrodynamic interactions are considered along the pathway .",
    "the inclusion of hydrodynamic effects captures the effect of solvent in an average sense , and the brownian framework would be an exact treatment in the limit where the solvent time scales are much faster than those associated with the heavy bodies .",
    "leading from the last point , the discrepancies between the md and bd results can be largely attributed to either the impact of the pulling force , that is the friction experienced along the force - biased surface significantly differs from that extracted from the equilibrium calculations , or to non - markovian effects . in the case of the passage over the first barrier of the lj system , at least some of the deviation is likely due to the large pulling force , although non - markovian effects should have an impact both in this case and in the other system studied .",
    "it has , for instance , been shown that dynamical caging effects can be exhibited along degrees of freedom that are associated with slowly varying memory functions .",
    "@xcite such phenomena can also serve to explain the long dwell times exhibited in the association trajectories .",
    "unfortunately , given the broad distributions involved and limited number of md trajectories that can be harvested , it is difficult to fully gauge the impact of non - markovian effects based on the present work .",
    "certainly , it is observed that , in the case of strongly hydrophobic plates , assembly is almost always preceded by the `` first '' drying transition , that is the system does not sample successive wet and dry states near the critical separation .",
    "one should expect such a process to be intrinsically non - markovian , although the bd with hi approach that is presently employed appears to at least capture some aspect of this `` waiting period '' for drying in an average way",
