    "synchronization of oscillators is a challenging topic which has received a lot of developments since the pioneering work of kuramoto  @xcite . within this paradigm ,",
    "an oscillator is described by its phase only ; this is sufficient to describe the transition to synchronization of almost any ensemble of coupled oscillators in the limit of weak coupling  @xcite .",
    "if one wants to take into account other variables to describe more accurately the state of the oscillators , the most natural generalization of kuramoto s paradigm is to consider not only the phase , but also the amplitude of the oscillators .",
    "the simplest model of such an oscillator is given by the stuart - landau equation , which is nothing but the normal form of a hopf bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "very few studies have been devoted to this much richer and generic case . despite detailed explorations  @xcite ,",
    "coupled amplitude equations suffer from the inherent complexity associated with the doubling of the number of freedom degrees compared to kuramoto phase equations .",
    "of particular interest to us is the discontinuous   or first order   transition to synchronization  @xcite that can be observed in this system .",
    "this feature is of great interest in complex systems to describe an abrupt change of their macroscopic behavior when only a single parameter is slightly changed .",
    "such a discontinuous transition has been documented in details in the kuramoto - sakaguchi phase model  @xcite under specific conditions on the randomness  @xcite , it has also been previously observed in a stuart - landau system in the limit of weak coupling  @xcite , when phase only is considered .",
    "we first present the model used in this paper , a set of coupled stuart - landau equations , and detail the observation of either a continuous or discontinuous transition to synchronization , depending on the imaginary part of the coupling parameter .",
    "we then perform a complete linear stability of the incoherent macrostate to determine the position of transition point .",
    "we then further search for the existence of particular synchronized macrostate , in order to illustrate a scenario for the discontinuous transition .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath0 oscillators @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "each oscillator is coupled equally to all of the others : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mean field .",
    "this model differs from the paradigmatic complex ginzburg - landau equation  @xcite not only because of the non - local coupling , but also because of the non - uniformity of the oscillators . as in the kuramoto model , natural frequencies @xmath5 of the @xmath0 oscillators are randomly distributed with a probability density @xmath6 which we choose unimodal for the sake of generality .",
    "varying @xmath7 from 0 to @xmath8 changes the nature of the coupling from diffusive ( dissipative ) to reactive ( dispersive )  @xcite and we show below that it also changes the nature of the transition to synchronization .",
    "we set @xmath9 without loss of generality , while choosing @xmath10 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "so we consider a real coefficient for the non - linear term , and a complex coefficient for the coupling term , in contrast to @xcite . in this case , the dynamics of oscillator @xmath11 obeys : @xmath12    this model system with @xmath10 has been derived exactly in the context of laser arrays  @xcite . in the following , we use a lorentzian distribution @xmath13 with @xmath14 and unless noted otherwise @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "numerical simulations were also conducted with a gaussian distribution without any qualitative changes to be noted .",

    "a stability analysis of these synchronized macrostates is still missing and is under progress , albeit difficult .",
    "the existence of such specific synchronized macrostates is directly related to the distribution of the effective frequencies . in our case , the natural frequency distribution is modified   with respect to the kuramoto model where only the phase dynamics is prescribed  by the additional amplitude variable for each oscillator : this extra freedom degree not only shifts the distribution , but also gives more weight to oscillators within a given frequency band .",
    "we also numerically studied the finite size effects and suggested that reducing the system size can result in the disappearance of the discontinuous transition .",
    "we discussed recent results in similar systems and argued that our description is generic .",

    "<S> we describe how the transition to synchronization in a system of globally coupled stuart - landau oscillators changes from continuous to discontinuous when the nature of the coupling is moved from diffusive to reactive . </S>",
    "<S> we explain this drastic qualitative change as resulting from the co - existence of a particular synchronized macrostate together with the trivial incoherent macrostate , in a range of parameter values for which the later is linearly stable . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the paradigmatic kuramoto model , this particular state observed at the synchronization transition contains a finite , non - vanishing number of synchronized oscillators , which results in a discontinuous transition . </S>",
    "<S> we consider successively two situations where either a fully synchronized state or a partially synchronized state exist at the transition . </S>",
    "<S> thermodynamic limit and finite size effects are briefly discussed , as well as connections with recently observed discontinuous transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> when one considers coupled oscillators that are described not only with their phase , but also with their amplitude , the transition to synchronization is much richer and can be discontinuous . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this can be achieved by simply changing the nature of the coupling coefficient from dissipative to dispersive . </S>",
    "<S> we relate this phenomena to the co - existence of particular macroscopic solutions , which we qualitatively illustrate . </S>"
