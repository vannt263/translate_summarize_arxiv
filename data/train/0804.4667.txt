    "low - dimensional and/or frustrated spin systems are a subject of thorough studies due to their variety of unusual ground states and quantum phenomena.@xcite one of the most striking effects in these systems is the formation of a spin - liquid , a dynamically disordered ground state with short - range magnetic correlations .",
    "spin liquids are caused by quantum fluctuations that impede or even suppress long - range magnetic ordering    quantum fluctuations are enhanced in systems with low spin value , low dimensionality , and/or magnetic frustration . at present , numerous spin models ( and the respective structural types ) for the frustrated spin systems are known.@xcite most of these systems are geometrically frustrated magnets , since the frustration is caused by the topology of the lattice .",
    "however , several models reveal frustration due to a specific topology of magnetic interactions , while the lattice itself does not prevent the system from long - range spin ordering .",
    "an important advantage of the latter systems is the possibility to vary the degree of frustration by tuning individual exchange couplings .",
    "hence , the formation of different ground states within one model and the access to quantum critical points are possible .",
    "below , we focus on the respective models and briefly review both one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) cases .    the simplest 1d lattice is a uniform chain . to frustrate such a system",
    ", one should introduce next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction @xmath5 .",
    "typically , @xmath5 is antiferromagnetic and competes with either ferromagnetic ( fm ) or antiferromagnetic ( afm ) nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting physics strongly depends on the sign of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , for @xmath7 ( i.e. , for afm nn coupling ) the system has a dimerized ground state for @xmath8 that may be further stabilized by lattice distortion as experimentally observed in the spin - peierls compound cugeo@xmath9.@xcite if @xmath10 , helical magnetic ordering is formed for @xmath11 , and the pitch angle of the spiral depends on the @xmath12 ratio .",
    "recently , a number of frustrated chain systems with @xmath13 have been studied,@xcite and even the vicinity of the quantum critical point at @xmath14 was accessed experimentally.@xcite in these systems , the possibility to tune the pitch angle by varying the exchange couplings may be particularly attractive due to another intriguing property ",
    "the magnetoelectric effect observed in licu@xmath15o@xmath15 and licuvo@xmath16.@xcite    in two dimensions , we will consider the square lattice .",
    "frustration can be introduced by diagonal nnn interactions ( @xmath5 ) that compete with nn interactions @xmath6 running along the side of the square . the resulting model is known as a frustrated square lattice ( fsl ) or @xmath17 model .",
    "the phase diagram of the fsl has been extensively studied theoretically ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "it shows three ordered phases ( ferromagnet , nel antiferromagnet , and columnar antiferromagnet ) as well as two critical regions near the quantum critical points at @xmath18 .",
    "basically , these regions are supposed to reveal spin - liquid ground states , although there is also a proposition of a nematic order at @xmath19.@xcite yet both the conjectures are not verified experimentally , since most of the fsl systems studied so far show columnar magnetic ordering and do not fall to the critical regions .",
    "nevertheless , the detailed investigation of the respective compounds was highly helpful and disclosed important methodological aspects of studying the frustrated spin systems and understanding their physics.@xcite    based on the above representative examples , one may expect that similar changes of the ground state due to the alteration of the exchange couplings could be realized in other frustrated models  either in one , two , or even three dimensions .",
    "this consideration and the recent investigation of an interesting fsl system , the complex vanadium phosphate pb@xmath15vo(po@xmath20 ( ref . ) , motivated us to start a systematic research of the related compounds .",

    "[ method ] , @xmath74 is an adjustable parameter that depends on the basis set , crystal structure of the compound under investigation , and the objective parameters of the calculation .",

    "it is preferable to use the quantity that is related to the objective parameters , since different objective parameters may require the application of different @xmath74 values .",
    "below , we will employ the curie - weiss temperature @xmath75 for this purpose .",
    "the curie - weiss temperature is the second - order term in the high - temperature series expansion of the magnetic susceptibility . according to ref .  , for spin-1/2 system @xmath76 .",
    "thus , @xmath75 is directly related to the exchange couplings and provides reasonable justification for the choice of the @xmath74 value .    clearly , the results for @xmath77 ev are in good agreement with the experimental estimate @xmath78 k , while for @xmath79 and 6 ev the compliance of the experimental and computational results is quite poor ( see table  [ table_lsda+u ] )",
    "thus , the optimal value of @xmath74 for ca(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 is 5 ev.@xcite yet in contrast to other spin-1/2 systems,@xcite the slight variation of @xmath74 results in a huge change in the exchange couplings ( see table  [ table_lsda+u ] ) .",
    "this effect will be further discussed in sec .",
    "[ lsda+u - discussion ] . in the rest of this subsection",
    ", we will focus on the exchange couplings calculated with @xmath77 ev .    according to tables  [ table_tb ] and [ table_lsda+u ] , @xmath80 indicating considerable fm contribution to either @xmath6 and/or @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath81 is smaller than @xmath82 and positive , hence there is also a fm contribution to @xmath81 , but the overall interaction remains afm .",
    "finally , @xmath83 , i.e. , the lsda+@xmath72 and tb estimates for these couplings are inconsistent .",
    "one may think that additional interactions contribute to the lsda+@xmath72 value of @xmath84 , but such contributions yield @xmath85 k only@xcite and do not explain the controversy .",
    "our experience shows that the tb approach is highly reliable for estimating exchange couplings in spin-1/2 systems.@xcite in contrast to lsda+@xmath72 , the tb approach includes a simple explicit relation between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , while the underlying lda calculation is _ ab initio _ and does not include any adjustable parameters .",
    "therefore , we have to admit the failure of lsda+@xmath72 to provide valid quantitative estimates of the weak exchange couplings in ca(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 ( see sec .",
    "[ lsda+u - discussion ] for further discussion ) . nevertheless , the lsda+@xmath72 results are helpful to get a qualitative understanding of the system under investigation .",
    "to get an idea about the fm interactions in ca(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 , we consider vanadium  vanadium separations for @xmath88 .",
    "the shortest separation ( 3.46 a ) corresponds to @xmath6 , while @xmath5 and @xmath81 reveal larger distances of 6.15 and 4.35 a , respectively .",
    "fm interactions are short - range ; therefore it is natural to suggest the strongest fm contribution to be that of @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath89 is close to zero , the overall interaction @xmath6 should be fm . unlike @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath81 are afm , although the fm contributions may also be non - negligible and reduce the absolute values of the exchange couplings .",
    "the presence of the ferromagnetic in - chain interaction @xmath6 is consistent with our studies of other vanadium phosphates having similar chains of corner - sharing octahedra.@xcite    thus , the basic microscopic model for ca(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 includes three exchange couplings : ferromagnetic @xmath6 and antiferromagnetic @xmath5 and @xmath81 interactions .",
    "the resulting spin system is 3d and frustrated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_frustration ] and sec .  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the computational results do not enable quantitative estimates of individual exchange couplings ( see the above discussion and sec .",
    "[ lsda+u - discussion ] ) .",
    "therefore , we do not make further numerical comparisons with the experimental data .",
    "clearly , the presence of both the fm and afm couplings is qualitatively consistent with the strongly reduced @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , band structure calculations suggest rather weak ( about 10 k ) exchange interactions in ca(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 consistent with the experimental energy scale @xmath3 k. we are convinced that the agreement between the band structure results and the experimental data is reasonable , especially taking into account the complexity of the spin system and the weakness of the exchange couplings .      to understand the @xmath90 vs. @xmath74 trends , one should consider exchange integrals as composed of the afm and fm contributions : @xmath91 .",
    "within one - band hubbard model , @xmath92 , while @xmath93 is independent of @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the overall @xmath90 should be reduced with the increase in @xmath72 .",
    "the repulsion potential @xmath74 is a parameter of the computational method rather than the true on - site coulomb repulsion , and @xmath94 is not necessarily proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "yet the increase in @xmath74 tends to improve the localization of @xmath96 electrons hence suppressing afm interactions .",
    "thus , one would expect that antiferromagnetic exchange couplings should be reduced with the increase of @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , the strongest coupling usually shows @xmath97 behavior , while other exchange integrals are nearly independent of @xmath74 ( see , e.g. , refs .   and ) .",
    "if @xmath98 , the overall @xmath90 is antiferromagnetic for any reasonable value of @xmath74 .",
    "however , for small @xmath99 the situation will be different , and the resulting @xmath90 may be positive for small @xmath74 and negative for large @xmath74 .",
    "the above considerations naturally explain , why fm interactions manifest themselves ( hence reducing @xmath75 ) at @xmath100 ev only . however , the fm interactions are further enhanced with the increase in @xmath74 , and this effect has a different origin .",
    "lsda+@xmath72 treats electronic correlations within mean - field approximation ; therefore the filled states of vanadium are merely shifted to lower energies as the repulsive potential @xmath74 is applied . at lower energies ,",
    "oxygen states dominate ; hence vanadium  oxygen hybridization is enhanced with the increase in @xmath74 .",
    "indeed , our calculations reveal the decrease in the magnetic moment of vanadium and the partial spin polarization of oxygen atoms as @xmath74 is increased . in case of ca(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 , this effect is even more pronounced as compared to other vanadium compounds.@xcite moreover , the exchange couplings are very weak , and the overestimated vanadium  oxygen hybridization results in unrealistic results for @xmath86 ( note the @xmath101 value of @xmath102 k at @xmath103 ev ) .    in summary",
    ", we should point to two complications that arise during lsda+@xmath72 calculations for vanadium oxides with very weak magnetic interactions .",
    "first , one has to apply a relatively large @xmath74 in order to suppress afm couplings and to reveal fm contributions .",
    "second , large @xmath74 tends to overestimate vanadium  oxygen hybridization and to produce unrealistic enhancement of the exchange couplings .",
    "there is an optimal @xmath74 value [ 5 ev in case of ca(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 ] that gives rise to a reasonable solution .",
    "however , even at this value both problems are retained . in general",
    ", we think that lsda+@xmath72 estimates of weak exchange couplings in highly complex structures are not accurate enough to provide quantitatively correct results .",
    "therefore , we mainly rely on the tb model in our analysis .",
    "nevertheless , lsda+@xmath72 estimates facilitate a qualitative understanding of the coupling scenario resulting in a reasonable microscopic description of the magnetic behavior .",
    "our experimental results show that the complex vanadium phosphates m(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 are strongly frustrated spin systems with competing fm and afm exchange couplings .",
    "magnetic susceptibility data reveal a maximum at @xmath105 k and nearly vanishing curie - weiss temperatures @xmath106 k. for simple spin systems with a single leading exchange coupling , @xmath107 and @xmath75 are usually close to each other , while the @xmath108 regime implies the presence of several different magnetic interactions in the system under investigation . as we have stated above , @xmath75 is equal to half of the sum of all the exchange integrals",
    ". thus , the low @xmath75 value points to the presence of both fm and afm interactions that compensate each other .",
    "further on , the low nel temperatures ( @xmath109 ) indicate that long - range ordering in the system is impeded by either low dimensionality and/or magnetic frustration .",
    "low - temperature specific heat provides the information on the spin excitations and presents one of the substantial characteristics of quantum magnets . in systems with strong quantum fluctuations ,",
    "the specific heat maximum is reduced due to the suppression of correlated spin excitations .",
    "the maximum of the magnetic specific heat of the m(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 compounds ( @xmath110 ) equals to @xmath111 only .",
    "this value is comparable to that for the spin-1/2 triangular lattice , a system with strong geometrical frustration , and lies well below @xmath110 typical for non - frustrated low - dimensional spin systems .",

    "[ lsda+u - discussion ] , we succeeded to construct a reasonable microscopic model that provides a plausible scenario of the frustration .",
    "the coupling within the structural chains ( the chains of corner - sharing vo@xmath112 octahedra , see fig .",
    "[ fig_struct ] ) is fm ( @xmath6 ) , while interchain couplings are afm ( @xmath5 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "the interactions form a quadrangle with one fm and three afm sides ( fig .",
    "[ fig_frustration ] ) .",
    "the fm in - chain interaction favors the parallel alignment of the spins within the chain , while the inter - chain afm interactions favor the antiparallel alignment .",
    "thus , the spin system is frustrated .",
    "below , we will use several experimental quantities ( @xmath113 , and @xmath114 ) in order to estimate the individual exchange couplings of the proposed model . assuming the ground state revealed by the lsda+@xmath72 calculations ( see sec .",
    "[ lsda+u - results ] ) , we find @xmath115 ( the heisenberg model is treated in a classical way ) . using the averaged estimates of @xmath116 and @xmath117 and assuming negative @xmath6 , one arrives at @xmath118 k , @xmath119 k , and @xmath120 k for ca(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 and @xmath121 k , @xmath122 k , and @xmath123  k for sr(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 . these values should be considered as rough estimates , since our model includes three interactions only , and the results of different methods for @xmath124 and @xmath75 are simply averaged .",
    "the estimates emphasize the similarity of the calcium and strontium compounds , although @xmath5 and @xmath81 values are somewhat different for m = ca and sr .",
    "the latter result may be relevant for the different breadth of the specific heat maxima in the two compounds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_cp - comparison ] )",
    ".    we should emphasize that at least two couplings ( @xmath6 and @xmath81 ) in the m(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 compounds have similar magnitude , and the spin system is essentially 3d rather than 1d with frustrated inter - chain couplings .",
    "the frustration is controlled by the magnitudes of the competing exchange interactions .",
    "for example , the decrease of the absolute value of @xmath6 will reduce the frustration , while for afm @xmath6 the system is non - frustrated at all .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , no theoretical results for this model are available .",
    "basically , one may expect the presence of strongly frustrated regions [ one is revealed by the m(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 compounds ] and quantum critical points in the respective phase diagram .",
    "further studies of the model and the appropriate materials are desirable .    finally , we will focus on the structural aspects of the present study .",
    "the main structural feature of the m(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 compounds deals with the chains of corner - sharing vo@xmath112 octahedra .",
    "such chains are typical for a wide variety of vanadium oxides.@xcite within a very straight - forward and naive approach , one can identify the chains of vanadium polyhedra as spin chains and arrive at 1d spin system with weak inter - chain couplings . according to sec .",
    "[ structure ] , such an approach is inconsistent with the orbital state of vanadium , and the actual spin system may have any dimensionality depending on the exchange couplings via po@xmath16 tetrahedra or other side groups . in the case of m(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 ,",
    "the actual spin system is 3d . yet in sr@xmath15vo(vo@xmath20 the spin system is 1d ( consistent with the naive expectations ) , but the spin chains are perpendicular to structural ones ( in contrast to the naive expectations).@xcite in general , the structures formed by vo@xmath112 octahedra and non - magnetic tetrahedral groups ( po@xmath16 , v@xmath125o@xmath16 , sio@xmath16 , etc . )",

    "thus , the interesting physics of the m(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 compounds is well hidden behind the 1d features of the crystal structure and weak magnetic interactions resulting in the paramagnetic behavior above @xmath126 k. only the combination of experimental and computational approaches enables us to unravel the relevant microscopic mechanisms and to achieve an insight of the underlying physics .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the m(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 compounds reveal strongly frustrated 3d spin systems with competing fm and afm interactions .",
    "the presence of both fm and afm interactions is indicated by the vanishing curie - weiss temperature @xmath75 , while the strong frustration is evidenced by the reduced maximum of the magnetic specific heat .",
    "the thermodynamic energy scale of the exchange couplings is @xmath3  k as shown by the specific heat and nmr data .",
    "band structure calculations suggest a plausible scenario of the frustration with the fm interaction along the structural chains and the afm interactions between the chains . in the resulting three - dimensional spin system ,",
    "the frustration is controlled by the magnitudes of the competing exchange couplings .",
    "the proposed spin model deserves further experimental and theoretical studies .",

    "the transition anomaly is more pronounced , and the origin of this effect is not clear . basically , the specific heat anomalies are affected by both intrinsic ( dimensionality of the spin system ) and extrinsic ( sample quality ) factors . at present , we can not distinguish which of these factors are relevant for the difference of the transition anomalies for the m(vo)@xmath15(po@xmath20 compounds .",
