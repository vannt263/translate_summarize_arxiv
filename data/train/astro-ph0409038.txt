    "the combination of several independent cosmological datasets , namely type ia supernovae ( @xcite ) , cmb ( @xcite ) and large scale structure ( see e.g. @xcite ) indicate that the universe is presently accelerating .",
    "the dark energy responsible for the acceleration appears to be a fraction of about 73% of the cosmic energy density today .",
    "the main properties of the dark energy are described in terms of its equation of state @xmath4 , i.e. the ratio between pressure and energy density ; its value , for a pure cosmological constant , is -1 .",
    "a current experiments indicate that the present value of @xmath5 should be in the range @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cosmological constant as an explanation to cosmic acceleration has two well - known problems : the coincidence problem ( why cosmological constant density and matter density are comparable today ? ) and the fine tuning problem ( i.e. why cosmological constant is 123 orders of magnitude less than planck scale ? ) . to solve the latter problem , a dynamical scalar field , known as quintessence ( @xcite ) , has been introduced as a minimal extension of the cosmological constant ; the dark energy equation of state gets dynamical alleviating the fine tuning problem . in most models",
    "the dark energy equation of state can be easily parameterized with only two parameters : @xmath7 and its first derivative with respect to the scale factor ( @xcite ) .",
    "the next challenge in cosmology is to constrain the time evolution of @xmath5 ; this can be done with future snia observations and future cmb experiments like planck ( @xcite ) . as we shall see in the next section ,",
    "the cmb power spectrum alone is limited to constrain dark energy .",
    "here we study the improvement which might be achieved by taking into account the non - gaussian distortion induced by the correlation between weak lensing and integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw ) .",
    "such signal is suitable studied in the higher order statistic of cmb anisotropies .",
    "we choose here the cmb bispectrum as an estimator of third order statistics ( see e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "the weak lensing effect on cmb anisotropies has been studied ( see e. g. @xcite and references therein ) and the third order statistics , the bispectrum , has been used to constrain the effective dark energy equation of state by @xcite .",
    "the main problem of the cmb power spectrum in studying the dark energy is the degeneracy that affects the distance of last scattering surface with respect the dark energy abundance and , in particular , its equation of state .",
    "its variation produces a change to the distance at last scattering surface ( see e. g. @xcite ) ; unfortunately such distance is degenerate with respect the main dark energy parameters .",
    "this can be easily understood writing the formula of the comoving distance to the last scattering surface ( we restrict our analysis to the flat case and we neglect the radiation contribution ) : @xmath8 in the previous equation @xmath9 is the speed of light , @xmath10 is the hubble constant today , @xmath11 is the redshift of last scattering surface , @xmath12 is the matter density today , @xmath13 ( because we consider only the flat case ) is the dark energy density and @xmath14 depends on the equation of state of dark energy @xmath15 and is defined as @xmath16 analyzing eq .",
    "( [ e : dist ] ) and ( [ e : fz ] ) , we can see that the time dependence on equation of state is washed out by two redshift integrations . in most models",
    "the dark energy equation of state can be parameterized with the following relation ( @xcite ) @xmath17 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are respectively its present and the asymptotic values .",
    "the difference @xmath18 represents the time - variation of dark energy equation of state .",
    "several different combinations of these dark energy parameters can produce the same comoving distance to the last scattering surface ; for example a comoving distance of about 13900 mpc can be obtained from these three sets of dark energy parameters : @xmath19 ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the net effect of this distance degeneracy is reflected in the cmb power spectrum ; different cosmological models with the same @xmath22 , will produce very similar power spectra ( see figure [ f : cmb ] , right panel ) .",
    "together with degeneracy in the projection effect , there is another physical motivation for which the cmb power spectrum is limited in its capability to constrain the dark energy : the power spectrum is mostly injected at decoupling , and at that time the dark energy density was negligible with respect to the matter density and could nt produce remarkable signatures in the cmb .    a way to include the cmb sensitivity on the dark energy is to consider the signatures in the cmb produced by the correlation between the integrated sachs - wolfe effect and the weak lensing on the cmb .",
    "the isw takes into account the rees - sciama effect that arises when the non linear growth of structures is included .",
    "the isw effect affects the cmb photons with a reddening ; the photon acquires a blueshift when it falls down into the potential well of growing structures and it acquires a redshift when it climbs out , but these two contributions are not balanced because the perturbations change in time .",
    "the gravitational lensing effect is the well - known deflection of light due to the gravitational potential of clump of matter .",
    "both effects arise at the epoch of structure formation , thus we can try to exploit them to alleviate the distance degeneracy . the correlation between isw and weak lensing",
    "induce a non vanishing power in the cmb higher order statistics , which we study it considering the cmb bispectrum .",
    "the latter is the harmonic transform of three point correlation function and it is null , within cosmic variance , if the cmb anisotropies are gaussian . since the isw and the weak lensing",
    "are produced by the same physical entity ( growing perturbations in the matter distribution ) , these secondary anisotropies are correlated and induce a non - vanishing bispectrum with exceeds the cosmic variance .",
    "when we consider the isw and weak lensing effect , the cmb anisotropies in a direction @xmath23 in the sky can be decomposed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 includes the primordial and isw anisotropy contributions , and the last term is the contribution from the weak lensing re - mapping ; @xmath26 is the deflection angle .",
    "following @xcite and expanding eq .",
    "( [ e : dt ] ) in spherical harmonics , from the general bispectrum definition @xmath27 , we can build the quantity @xmath28 where @xmath29 indicates the permutations over the three multipoles , the parenthesis are the wigner s 3j symbols , @xmath30 is the primordial cmb power spectrum , and @xmath31_{k=\\frac{l}{r(z)}}\\ , \\ ] ] is the correlation between lensing and isw . in eq .",
    "( [ e : ql ] ) @xmath32 is the gravitational potential power spectrum ; to evaluate the non linear contribution to density power spectrum we have used the existing semi - analytical approach ( @xcite ) .    the asymptotic redshift behavior of the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ e : ql ] ) , for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , is vanishing ( @xcite ) ; in fact , fixing the multipole , at low redshift the gravitational potential power spectrum probes infinite wavenumbers where the power is vanishing , while at high redshift the gravitational potential is constant since the universe approach the standard cdm .",
    "therefore , the bispectrum signal is acquired at intermediate redshifts only , and is expected to reflect the cosmological expansion rate at that epoch .",
    "the dark energy domination occurs approximately at the same time , and therefore the bispectrum can be used as a tool to investigate the dark energy properties and to alleviate the distance degeneracy ( @xcite ) .",
    "this can be seen clearly in figure [ f : cmb ] where we compare the cmb power spectrum with the equilateral bispectrum @xmath35 for three dark energy models with the same comoving distance at last scattering surface : the degeneracy is removed at the bispectrum level ; we describe in the next section the shape of bispectrum curves .",
    "the bispectrum has some peculiar features that can be used to discriminate between different cosmological models . plotting the absolute value of bispectrum we have a _ cusp _",
    ", for which the bispectrum is vanishing , and its position depends on cosmological model ( see right panel in figure [ f : cmb ] ) .",
    "the position of this zero - crossing point is the value of the multipole @xmath36 for which the integrand of @xmath37 is null as shown @xcite : the positive contribution ( due to linear growth ) balances exactly the negative one ( due to non linear growth ) .",
    "another relevant feature that must be taken into account is the amplitude of the bispectrum in the linear part ( @xmath38 ) : different cosmological models produce different amplitudes in the linear regime .",
    "the linear power affect @xmath36 : the higher is the power in the linear regime ( @xmath38 ) , the higher is the value of @xmath36 .",
    ".position and shift of multipole @xmath36 of bispectrum zero - crossing varying the main cosmological parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ t : shift ] we analyze the variation of @xmath36 with respect to the main cosmological parameters : dark energy equation of state today @xmath1 , dark energy density @xmath0 , baryons energy density @xmath39 , hubble constant @xmath40 and spectral index of primordial fluctuations @xmath41 .",
    "the values of @xmath36 and its shift are evaluated when we vary each parameter , fixing the others to a reference model . at first sight @xmath36",
    "is more sensitive to parameters which affect geometrically distances @xmath42 , with the exception of @xmath1 at least in the interval considered .",
    "unfortunately the bispectrum is much more noisy than the cmb power spectrum already at the level of cosmic variance , since it is a higher order effect .",
    "we can increase the signal to noise ratio including all triangles configurations in @xmath43-space ( i.e. considering all possible multipoles triplets ) in our analysis .",
    "we have tested the improvement that the bispectrum can bring to the power spectrum alone building a three - dimensional likelihood on dark energy parameters @xmath44 and choosing a fiducial model for an ideal ( cosmic variance limited ) experiment . in figure",
    "[ f : like ] we show our results marginalizing each time over one dark energy parameter ; as we can see in all cases the contours of the joint likelihoods are narrower than the contours of the power spectrum likelihoods alone . this first , and very preliminary result ,",
    "is encouraging : a gain is expected on the estimation of dark energy equation of state at the beginning of structure formation .",
    "we have discussed how to alleviate the distance degeneracy in the cmb power spectrum using the isw and weak lensing induced cmb bispectrum ; we have shown some preliminary results about the sensitivity of the bispectrum with respect to the main cosmological parameters .",
    "we have simulated a joint likelihood of power spectrum and bispectrum , limited to only dark energy parameters and fixing a fiducial cosmological model .",
    "our preliminary results indicate that adding the bispectrum likelihood to the power spectrum one , the contour levels are narrower and a gain in the estimation of dynamics of dark energy equation of state is expected .",
    "further study is needed to assess the magnitude of this improvement .",
    "future precision cosmology data from high resolution experiments like planck and future measures of tridimensional matter power spectrum with ly-@xmath45 forest ( @xcite ) and cosmic shear ( @xcite ) will help in the use of the bispectrum since they will allow on a better knowledge of the matter power spectrum affecting the bispectrum signal ."
