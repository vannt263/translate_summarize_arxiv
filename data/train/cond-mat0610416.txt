    "andreev reflection @xcite , the mechanism by which an electron from a normal electrode is reflected as a hole at a normal metal - superconductor ( ns ) interface while a pair is transmitted into the superconductor , takes place in a region of size @xmath0 , the coherence length of the disordered superconductor .",
    "crossed andreev reflection ( car ) in a three terminal normal metal - insulator - superconductor - insulator - normal metal ( n@xmath1isin@xmath2 ) trilayer corresponds to an andreev process such that an electron from n@xmath2 is transmitted as a hole in n@xmath1 over a distance of order @xmath0 , leaving a pair in the superconductor .",

    "the nature of the dominant crossed transport channel can be controlled by the relative spin orientation of strongly polarized ferromagnets in a ferromagnet - insulator - superconductor - insulator - ferromagnet ( f@xmath1isif@xmath2 ) structure @xcite : ec ( car ) dominates with ( anti)parallel spin orientations , as it can be seen from the spin of the electron or hole transmitted in electrode `` a '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", ec dominates for normal metals with highly transparent interfaces @xcite . crossed transport dominated either by ec or by car",
    "is obtained in the three recent experiments mentioned above @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the crossed conductance @xcite @xmath3 of a three terminal device measures the sensitivity of the current @xmath4 flowing through electrode `` a '' with voltage @xmath5 to the voltage @xmath6 applied on electrode `` b '' : @xmath7 ( see the circuit on fig .",

    "the voltage @xmath5 may be arbitrary but , according to available experiments @xcite , we consider that electrode `` a '' is grounded ( @xmath8 ) , as the superconductor .    theoretically , the crossed conductance defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gab ] ) vanishes to lowest order in the tunnel amplitudes for a n@xmath1isin@xmath2 trilayer because the electron and hole transmitted by ec and car have opposite charges , and because of a symmetry of crossed transport : car and ec have identical transmission coefficients @xcite ( see fig .  [",

    "this property does not hold for a single channel ballistic superconductor connected by single atom contacts to normal electrodes : in this case , the crossed conductance to lowest order in the tunnel amplitudes oscillates around zero with periodicity @xmath9 ( the fermi wave - length ) as the distance @xmath10 between the contacts is varied .",
    "oscillations in the fermi phase factors average to zero in the realistic case of a multichannel contact @xcite , or in the case of a diffusive superconductor @xcite with non magnetic impurities",
    ".    the theoretical prediction of a vanishing of the crossed conductance in a n@xmath1isin@xmath2 trilayer is however contradicted by the recent experiment by russo _",
    "@xcite , that provides in addition evidence of a disappearance of the crossed signal in a magnetic field applied parallel to the layers .",
    "a characteristic energy scale @xmath11 within the superconducting gap @xmath12 is found experimentally  @xcite , at which the crossed signal changes sign from ec to car as the bias voltage energy increases above @xmath13 , and eventually vanishes at higher energies .",
    "the experimental @xmath11 decreases to zero as the superconductor thickness increases .",
    "one may conjecture that such experiments are characteristic of a geometry - dependent coupling of the superconducting phase variable to crossed transport by evanescent waves .",
    "as we show , a natural possibility for such coupling ( quantum interference effects in the superconductor ) results in an energy scale @xmath13 smaller than the superconducting gap for extended junctions .",
    "another possibility ( coulomb interactions ) was put forward by levy yeyati _",

    "a superconducting condensate is on the contrary delocalized and has a well defined phase .",
    "superconductivity and weak localization are related to each other because the cooper pairs of a superconductor can participate to the cooperons of weak localization .",
    "smith and ambegaokar show indeed that the phase stiffness of a superconductor is reduced by weak localization @xcite .",
    "weak localization is however strongly modified in subgap transport through a superconductor by the following property of evanescent wave functions .",
    "electron tunneling through a normal metal involves the simultaneous forward propagation in time of an electron and the backward propagation in time of a hole , forming a diffuson .",
    "the terminology `` transmission mode '' is used here for describing the effect of disorder on subgap tunneling . for evanescent states",
    ", a hole propagating backward in time can be replaced in a transmission mode by an electron propagating forward in time : the wave - function of a normal electron in a box of size @xmath0 being real valued , is equal to the time reversed particle wave - function in the absence of a magnetic field .",

    ", a pair of electrons propagating forward in time can be obtained from a cooper pair in the condensate .      as discussed in the preceding section , transmission modes in a disordered superconductor correspond to two quasiparticles scattering on the same sequence of impurities .",

    "the distinguishing features of diffuson self - crossings in subgap transport by evanescent wave functions ( see figs .  [",

    "the intervention of the condensate in such loop processes is obvious from noting that the contribution of weak localization - like processes to the crossed conductance couples to a phase gradient in the superconductor @xcite .",
    "these processes result in an attractive interaction of strength @xmath17 per carrier injected in the gap , in units of the fermi energy @xmath18 .",
    "this interaction due to quantum interference effects has all the features of a _ very slow _",
    "phonon exchange : it is attractive , and retarded by a time @xmath19 ( because weak localization - like processes induces transitions only at energy @xmath20 ) .",

    "the superconducting phase fluctuates by @xmath36 with a frequency @xmath37 , but its average value over a time window larger than the retardation of interactions @xmath38 does not fluctuate .",
    "the andreev current from the superconductor to electrode n@xmath1 vanishes for @xmath25 because the superconductor chemical potential fluctuates between typical values @xmath39 .",
    "the crossed conductance is then dominated by ec , as it can be seen from second order perturbation theory in the tunnel amplitudes @xcite ( see fig .",

    "fluctuations by one quasiparticle with spin-@xmath43 in the superconductor do not couple to the crossed signal because ec has an opposite sign for the two orientations of @xmath43 .",
    "the remaining contribution to the crossed signal ( not shown on fig .",

    "we conclude that a change of sign from a positive ec crossed resistance for @xmath25 to a negative andreev reflection crossed resistance for @xmath40 occurs , and that the crossed signal disappears at higher energies , as in experiments @xcite .",
