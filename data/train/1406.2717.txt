    "merging and mass - transferring white dwarfs ( wds ) are responsible for the creation of a variety of exotic astrophysical systems and events . among these are isolated sdb / sdo stars ( likely created by the merger of two he wds ; saio & jeffery 2000 ; han et al .",

    "; clayton 2012 ) , am cvn binaries ( possibly created by stable mass transfer from a he wd onto a co wd ; warner 1995 ; tutukov & yungelson 1996 ; han & webbink 1999 ; nelemans et al .",
    "2001a ) , and possibly high - mass neutron stars and magnetars ( created by the accretion - induced collapse of merging co wds or accreting o - ne - mg wds ; saio & nomoto 1985 ; nomoto & kondo 1991 ; saio & nomoto 2004 ) .",
    "more importantly , merging or accreting co wds may be the progenitors of type ia supernovae ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 , di stefano 2010 ; gilfanov & bogdan 2010 ; maoz et al . 2010 ; li et al .",

    "; gonzalez hernandez et al . 2012 ; schaefer & pagnotta 2012 ) , although the pre - supernova conditions of the wd are still a subject of intense investigation .",
    "compact wd binaries ( with periods in the range of minutes to hours ) are also being discovered at an accelerating pace ( e.g. mullally et al .",

    "2013 , see marsh 2011 for a review ) .",
    "these systems will begin mass transfer within a hubble time , although it is not always clear which observed wd systems will result in which phenomena .",
    "recent simulations ( e.g. , segretain et al .  1997 ; yoon et al .  2007 ; loren - aguilar et al .",

    "2013 ) have shed new light on the outcome of wd mergers , however , the initial conditions of these simulations are predicated upon the tidal effects that precede ( and may ultimately determine the stability of ) the mass transfer process .",
    "it is thus crucial to understand how tides operate up to the moment of roche - lobe overflow .",
    "it is also important to quantify the rate of tidal dissipation once mass transfer begins .",
    "previous works ( nelemans et al .",
    "2001b , marsh et al .",
    "2004 ) have shown that the strength of tidal torques may be important in determining the stability of mass transfer .",
    "low mass ratio systems with @xmath0 are expected to have stable mass transfer , while high mass ratio systems with @xmath1 are expected to be unstable and merge .",
    "the fates of intermediate mass ratio systems with @xmath2 ( such as the recently discovered 12.75 minute binary , brown et al .",
    "2011 ) are less certain .",
    "the stability of mass transfer in these systems may depend on the rate at which tidal torques can transfer rotational angular momentum from the accretor back to the orbit .",
    "this paper is the fifth in a series ( see fuller & lai 2011,2012a,2012b,2013 , hereafter papers i - iv ) dedicated to the physics of tidal interactions and their observational consequences in compact wd binaries . in these previous works , we examined the tidal excitation , propagation , and dissipation of gravity waves ( g - waves ) that are restored by buoyancy forces within co and he wds . the waves dissipate energy and angular momentum , leading to the rotational synchronization and tidal heating of wds in compact systems .",
    "we found that gravity waves are excited at compositional gradients within the wds and propagate toward the surface where they become highly non - linear , causing them to break and locally deposit their angular momentum .",
    "this results in strong tidal heating in the outer layers of the wd , and causes the wds to be spun up from the outside in .",
    "tides in white dwarfs have also been examined in several previous works using parameterized tidal dissipation laws ( iben et al .",
    "1998 , piro 2011 , dallosso & rossi 2013 ) and in calculations of the tidal excitation of oscillation modes ( willems et al .",
    "2010 , valsecchi et al .",
    "encouragingly , the detailed study of wd tides by burkart et al .",
    "2013 utilizes techniques comparable to papers i and ii , and reaches generally similar conclusions .    however , these works ( and all previous works that we know of ) have ignored the influence of rotation on the wave dynamics .",
    "while this approximation works for slowly spinning wds at the beginning of the tidal spin up process , it breaks down for wds nearing synchronous rotation in which the tidal forcing frequency becomes comparable to the spin frequency .",
    "the approximation is even worse for wds being spun up to super - synchronous rotation via mass transfer .    in this study",
    ", we attempt to quantify the effect of the coriolis force on the efficiency of tidal angular momentum transport . to do this",
    ", we employ the so - called traditional \" approximation frequently used to study the influence of rotation on gravity waves ( see e.g. , chapman & lindzen 1970 , bildsten et al .",
    "1996 , lee & saio 1997 , townsend 2003 ) .",
    "the coriolis force modifies the angular dependence of the gravity waves , confining them to the equatorial region of the star .",
    "this affects their overlap with the ( predominantly quadrupolar ) tidal potential that excites them .",
    "moreover , the coriolis force modifies the radial wavelength of gravity waves , which in turn affects the amplitude to which they are excited .",
    "finally , the coriolis force allows for the existence of inertial and rossby waves ( r - waves ) , which are especially important in super - synchronously rotating wds in which tidal dissipation occurs through the excitation of retrograde waves ( i.e. , the wave pattern propagates opposite to the direction of the spin in a frame co - rotating with the wd ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ traditional ] , we review the influence of rotation under the traditional approximation , and we examine its effect on tidally excited gravito - inertial waves . in section",
    "[ tidal ] , we investigate the effects of rotation on the excitation of the dynamical tide and discuss how the dynamical tide transports energy angular momentum . in section",
    "[ torque ] , we present our numerical results of tidal dissipation rates in rotating wds and analyze its effect on the orbital and spin evolution of compact wd binaries .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] , we discuss the implications of our results , and how they may affect wds in various types of compact binary systems .",
    "the influence rotation on stellar oscillations has been examined in many previous works , and we choose to follow along the lines of bildsten et al .",

    "we review the basic physics in order to understand how rotation will affect tidally excited waves in wds .",

    ", @xmath5 is the lagrangian displacement vector , @xmath6 is the eulerian pressure perturbation , @xmath7 is the star s spin vector , @xmath8 is the tidal potential of the companion star , and the other quantities have their usual meaning .",
    "we have assumed a time dependence @xmath9 , and we have adopted the cowling approximation ( i.e. , we have ignored the perturbation to the star s gravitational potential , which is a good approximation for the gravity waves of interest ) .",
    "additionally , we have ignored the centrifugal force and stellar oblateness , which is a good approximation as long as the stellar spin is much smaller than break - up , i.e. , when @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we assume that the star rotates rigidly along the @xmath11-axis such that @xmath12 , with the spin vector aligned with the orbital angular momentum .    for adiabatic oscillations ,",
    "the perturbed momentum equations become [ xir1 ] -^2 _ r = - ( p + u ) + u - p - n^2 _ r - 2i_s _ , [ xit1 ] -^2 _ = - ( p + u ) - 2i_s _ , [ xip1 ] -^2 _ = - ( p + u ) + 2i_s ( _ + _ r ) . here we have used the adiabatic relation [ drho ] = p + _ r , where @xmath13 is the sound speed and @xmath14 is the brunt - vaisala frequency .",
    "additionally , the continuity equation implies [ cont ] + ( r^2 _",
    "r ) + _ _ = 0 , where the @xmath15 subscript denotes the horizontal part of each vector .    in the traditional approximation , the last term in equations [ xir1 ] and [ xip1 ]",
    "are ignored .",
    "the traditional approximation works well for gravity waves , which in the non - rotating wkb limit ( and with @xmath16 and @xmath4 of order unity ) have @xmath17 .",
    "then , in regions in the star where @xmath18 , the last terms in equations [ xir1 ] and [ xip1 ] become negligible and may be discarded .",
    "equation [ xir1 ] then separates from equations [ xit1 ] and [ xip1 ] , and the angular dependence of the waves separates from the radial dependence .",
    "the traditional approximation will be valid for the dynamical tide of a rotating wd , which is comprised mainly of rotationally modified gravito - inertial waves in the outer layers of the star where @xmath19 ( see paper ii ) .",
    "however , the traditional approximation does not apply to the equilibrium tide , which is the hydrostatic response of the star to the tidal potential , and which is dominated by fundamental modes . to circumvent this problem",
    ", we decompose the response of the star into equilibrium and dynamical components : [ xidyn ] = ^eq + ^dyn .",

    "we detail this procedure in appendix [ eqtide ] .",
    "the angular dependence of @xmath22 is found by solving laplace s tidal equation : [ lap ] ( h_k ) = - _ k h_k , where @xmath23 is an angular eigenvalue , @xmath24 is its associated eigenfunction ( the hough function ) , and the operator @xmath25 is [ lop ] = ( ) - + . here ,",

    "rotation becomes important for @xmath31 , and it is easily verified that the solutions to equation [ lap ] converge to the associated legendre polynomials as @xmath32 .",
    "as discussed in lee & saio ( 1997 ) , the angular dependence of the perturbed variables in the traditional approximation is [ xirang ] _",
    "r(r,,,t ) = _ r(r ) h_k ( )",
    "e^i m - i t , whereas [ xitang ] _",
    "( r,,,t ) = _ ( r ) h_k ( ) e^i m - i t , and [ xipang ] _ ( r,,,t ) = _ ( r ) h_k ( ) e^i m - i t. here , @xmath33 . we have adopted the indexing notation of lee & saio ( 1997 ) to identify the hough functions .",
    "the @xmath34 subscript specifies the branch on which the hough function lies , and ( for @xmath35 ) indicates the number of nodes in the angular eigenfunction in the non - rotating ( @xmath36 ) limit .",
    "thus , the @xmath37 modes correspond to @xmath38 modes , @xmath39 corresponds to @xmath40 , etc",
    ".    for @xmath41 , equation [ lap ] is a sturm - liouville problem , and each solution can be traced back to an associated legendre polynomial at @xmath42 . for @xmath43 , equation [ lap ] is no longer a sturm - liouville problem , and additional solutions exist .",
    "these solutions correspond to r - modes and inertial modes , which only exist in the range @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "lee & saio ( 1997 ) label these solutions with negative values of @xmath34 , and we adopt the same convention here .",
    "however , we note that the @xmath45 r - mode has no nodes in its angular eigenfunction , similar to the @xmath37 mode . for this reason , it will be the most important retrograde mode in tidal processes for @xmath46 .",
    "we solve equation [ lap ] for @xmath47 in the range @xmath48 using relaxation techniques .",
    "this method avoids many of the problems associated with singularities discussed by bildsten et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and lee & saio ( 1997 ) .",
    "we normalize the hough functions in the same manner as spherical harmonics : [ norm ] da |h_k()|^2 = 1 , with the integral extending over the surface of a sphere , @xmath49 .",
    "we limit our analysis to @xmath50 waves because they couple most strongly to the tidal potential , which is dominated by @xmath51 components .",

    "the @xmath53 branches couple most strongly with the @xmath54 components of the tidal potential , which are small and can be ignored . ] for @xmath55 , the @xmath37 solutions converge to @xmath56 , as expected . for @xmath57 , the @xmath58 , @xmath37 solution asymptotes to @xmath59 while the @xmath60 mode increases proportional to @xmath61",
    "as discussed in bildsten et al . 1996 . as @xmath30 increases ,",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath24 become localized near the equator , especially for the @xmath60 solution .",
    "the @xmath45 solutions emerge for @xmath43 .",
    "their eigenvalues @xmath52 asymptote to negative infinity at @xmath62 and become positive at @xmath63 for @xmath60 , @xmath45 .",
    "the value of @xmath52 remains below zero at all values of @xmath30 for @xmath58 , @xmath64 modes .",
    "physically this is significant because waves in the wkb limit follow the dispersion relation [ gdisp ] k_r^2 = , where @xmath65 is the radial wavenumber and [ lamb ] l_k^2 = is the lamb frequency squared . if @xmath66 , gravity waves are evanescent where @xmath67 . instead , these waves propagate as inertial waves in regions where @xmath68 .",
    "we do not examine these inertial waves in detail because they do not satisfy the assumptions of the traditional approximation .",
    "however , the @xmath60 , @xmath45 waves with @xmath69 behave like gravity waves where @xmath70 .",
    "we refer to them as r - waves .",
    "the r - waves satisfy the assumptions of the traditional approximation and can be accurately characterized by our techniques .",
    "the extent to which an angular mode contributes to tidal processes is largely determined by its overlap with the tidal potential , which can be expanded in spherical harmonics . in the rotating frame of the stars , the largest time - variable components are the @xmath51 components : [ u ] u_2,m(*r*,t ) + u_2,-m(*r*,t ) = u(r ) with [ u2 ] u(r ) = - r^2 and [ om ] = m ( -_s ) , with @xmath71 the orbital frequency of the binary , @xmath72 the semi - major axis , and @xmath73 . in the preceding ( and following ) sections we have chosen to work with the @xmath74 term with @xmath75 .",
    "therefore when @xmath76 , we use @xmath58 such that the orbit is prograde , and when @xmath77 we use @xmath60 such that orbit is retrograde ( in the rotating frame of the star ) .",
    "the tidal potential appears as a forcing term in equations [ xir1]-[xip1 ] , but as noted above ( see also paper ii ) , we must subtract out the equilibrium tidal response to solve for the dynamical tide .",
    "the forced oscillation equations for the dynamical part of the tidal response are ( see appendix [ eqtide ] ) [ dp ] p^dyn = - p^dyn + ( ^2 - n^2 ) _",
    "r^dyn + h_klm ^2 _ r^eq + h_klm m q ^2 _ ^eq , [ dxir ] _ r^dyn = ( - ) _",
    "r^dyn + ( - ) p^dyn - _ ^eq - _ r^eq .",
    "these equations describe the forced response of a hough wave ( specified by indices @xmath34 and @xmath4 ) due to one component of the tidal potential ( specified by indices @xmath16 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "all quantities are functions of @xmath78 only , as we have already integrated over their angular dependence .",
    "the key observation used to derive equations [ dp ] and [ dxir ] is that the traditional approximation applies to the dynamical tide _ but not to the equilibrium tide_. properly subtracting the equilibrium tide leads to the appearance of the last terms in equations [ dp ] and [ dxir ] , which are additional forcing terms due to the coriolis force on the equilibrium tide .",
    "these terms vanish in the non - rotating ( @xmath32 ) limit but are very important when @xmath57 , and to our knowledge have not been taken into account in any previous studies .        the coefficients @xmath79 and @xmath80 are angular overlap integrals between hough functions and spherical harmonics , and are given by equations [ hklm ] and [ gklm ] in appendix [ eqtide ] .",
    "figure [ wdrotqh ] shows values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 as a function of @xmath30 for the @xmath51 component of the tidal potential . in the non - rotating limit @xmath32 , the hough functions reduce to spherical harmonics , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . for @xmath37 waves",
    ", the value of @xmath83 falls off monotonically with increasing @xmath30 . for the prograde @xmath58 waves",
    ", @xmath83 falls off slowly , and the @xmath37 , @xmath58 gravity waves dominate the tidal energy transfer at all values of @xmath30 for subsyncronous rotation ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "however , @xmath83 falls off much more rapidly for the @xmath60 waves , diminishing their impact on tidal energy transfer .",
    "instead , the @xmath45 waves become important , with the value of @xmath83 approaching unity for @xmath84 , and slowly decreasing for larger values of @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , while the @xmath37 , @xmath60 gravity waves are most important at low values of @xmath30 for supersynchronous rotation ( @xmath77 ) , the @xmath45 , @xmath60 r - waves become important for @xmath85 . , the traditional approximation does not accurately characterize the @xmath45 , @xmath60 r - waves .",
    "it remains unclear whether the @xmath45 branch of waves can contribute significantly to tidal dissipation in this range of @xmath30 . ]    for @xmath57 , we find @xmath86 for all branches of hough waves considered here . from figure [ wdrotqh ] , it is evident that when @xmath87 , @xmath88 for the @xmath37 , @xmath58 branch and the @xmath45 , @xmath60 branch , whereas @xmath89 for the @xmath37 , @xmath60 branch ( although we shall see below that this branch contributes negligibly to tidal torque in wds when @xmath57 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath90 term can dominate the tidal forcing for large values of @xmath30 , and the failure to include it may lead to large errors in the calculation of the dynamical tidal response .",
    "the tidally excited waves carry energy and angular momentum from the region of excitation to the region of wave damping . as in papers ii - iv",
    ", we assume the waves propagate into the outer layers of the star , depositing their energy and angular momentum in the low density subsurface regions where the waves become highly non - linear and break ( we justify this assumption in section [ torque ] , but see papers ii and iv for more discussion on non - linear wave breaking ) .",
    "consequently we impose a radiative outer boundary condition , below the surface convection zone , although the precise location is not important as long as it is above the radius at which the waves are excited , and in a stably - stratified region where the waves roughly obey wkb scaling relations . ] as described in paper ii . the net tidal torque on the star is then calculated from the angular momentum luminosity flowing through the outer boundary .",

    "we have emphasized the coordinate dependence of the perturbation variables , as in equation [ xirang ] , for clarity .",
    "the second line follows from averaging the first line ( the angle brackets denote a time average ) , and the factor of two accounts for both the wave displacement @xmath5 and its complex conjugate .",
    "the third line reduces the perturbations to their dynamical tide components , which we justify in appendix [ angmomapp ] .",
    "the fourth line follows from integration over the spherical surface , and utilizes the normalization of hough functions from equation [ norm ] .",
    "finally , the fifth line uses the relation @xmath93 and shows the similarity between equation [ angmom ] and the familiar eulerian result for non - rotating stars given by equation 39 of paper ii .",
    "we note that in a rotating star , the wave energy and angular momentum fluxes can not be simply derived from the eulerian perturbations as they are in paper ii and many other works ( e.g. , lee & saio 1993 ) . the reasons can be traced back to the differences between eulerian and lagrangian averaging discussed in andrews & mcintyre ( 1978a,1978b ) , and are linked with the stokes drift terms that enter at second order in the wave amplitude .",
    "indeed , one can naively calculate the mass flux through a spherical surface using eulerian perturbations , @xmath94.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which in general is non - zero , reflecting the mass transported through the surface by the stokes drift .",
    "one can calculate the correct second - order wave flux by subtracting out the contribution from stokes drift . in the rotating frame",
    ", the stokes drift velocity can be calculated from the linear wave solution via ( andrews & mcintyre 1978a ) [ stokes ] * v*^s = + cc , where the overbar indicates an average over azimuth and time .",
    "the stokes drift adds contributions to the wave fluxes which are implicitly included in second - order expressions such as equation [ mdot ] .",
    "one can explicity calculate the stokes drift contribution from the stokes drift velocity .",
    "for instance , the stokes drift contribution to the mass flux is [ stokesm ] ^s(r ) = r^2 da v^s_r .",
    "some algebra shows that the mass flux of equation [ mdot ] is due entirely due to the stokes contribution of equation [ stokesm ] . to calculate the  wave \" contribution we simply subtract the stokes drift contribution , therefore the mass flux due to the waves is @xmath95 as we should expect .",
    "we can perform a similar procedure to calculate the wave angular momentum flux from the reynold s stress , as long as we include the torque exerted by the coriolis force on the stokes drift current .",
    "the end result is that the wave angular momentum flux is given by equation [ angmom ] .",
    "we also note that equation [ angmom ] implies ( see appendix [ angmomapp ] ) that in the rotating frame , [ enang ] ( r ) = ( r ) .",
    "this relation holds regardless of the rotation rate or the latitudinal dependence of the fluid perturbations , in accordance with kumar et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "stokes currents are a real physical effect and are generated by propagating waves in the star .",
    "the currents cause fluid elements to drift over time , allowing them to transport mass , energy , angular momentum , metals , etc . while equation ( [ angmom ] ) accurately calculates the net tidal torque on the star , the stokes currents may be important for the redistribution of angular momentum within the star .",
    "additionally , a counter - current must be produced ( akin to the undertow produced by breaking waves at a beach ) to balance the mass transport via stokes currents .",
    "these counter - currents are not captured by linear calculations , and they need not be equal and opposite to the stokes drift .",
    "the stokes drift current and counter - current may therefore set - up a circulation which could enhance mixing processes , and which could generate or reduce differential rotation . quantifying these effects",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper , but they should be investigated in future studies .",
    "we have now assembled all the ingredients necessary to calculate the tidal torque on white dwarfs in compact binaries . given an orbital frequency @xmath71 and spin frequency @xmath96 ,",
    "the @xmath51 component of the tidal potential has tidal forcing frequency @xmath97 and spin parameter @xmath98 .",
    "we first calculate the hough functions @xmath99 for the branches @xmath34 that contribute to the tidal torque , and the associated overlap integrals @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we then solve equations [ dp ] and [ dxir ] with the outgoing wave outer boundary condition , as discussed in paper ii , and use equation [ angmom ] to calculate the associated tidal torque . in appendix",
    "[ innerbc ] , we discuss the inner boundary condition and subtleties that can arise when using the traditional approximation .",
    "it is useful to express the tidal torque in dimensionless units ( see papers ii and iii ) such that [ jdot ] t_tide = _ z(r_out ) = t_0 f(,q ) , with [ t0 ] t_0 = ( ) ^5 .",
    "the quantity @xmath100 is the dimensionless tidal torque and is related to the parameterized tidal dissipation factor @xmath101 ( goldreich & soter 1966 ; alexander 1973 ; hut 1981 ) by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the tidal love number .",

    "[ wdrotl2m2 ] and [ wdrotl2m2n ] , the bend in the vertical structure at @xmath113 is caused primarily by the changing eigenvalue @xmath23 . since the radial wavenumber for g - waves scales as @xmath114 , the changing value of @xmath23 affects the radial wavelength of the tidally excited waves and",
    "thereby alters the resonant \" forcing frequencies at which the tidal response is maximized ( see paper ii ) .",
    "figure [ wdrotl2m2 ] shows the tidal response for the prograde g - waves that dominate tidal spin - up for sub - synchronous wds ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "other than the slight bend in in the resonant ridges at @xmath113 , the value of @xmath100 is not strongly dependent on the value of @xmath30 and hence is relatively insensitive to the rotation of the wd ( as long as the wd spins sub - synchronously ) .",
    "consequently , the tidal torque and heating rates derived in papers ii and iv are not strongly modified by the presence of the coriolis force , and the general conclusions of those works remain valid .",
    "the tidal response for retrograde waves in super - synchronous wds ( @xmath107 ) , shown in figures [ wdrotl2m2n ] and [ wdrotl2m2r ] , exhibits considerably more dependence on the value of @xmath30 .",
    "the retrograde g - waves ( with @xmath37 and @xmath60 ) are strongly modified by the coriolis force , primarily because their angular eigenvalue @xmath23 increases rapidly for @xmath31 ( for these waves @xmath115 for @xmath57 , bildsten & cutler 1996 ) . not only does this cause a strong bend in the location of the resonant ridges",
    ", it also strongly reduces the tidal torque exerted by these waves . since the value of @xmath23 increases with @xmath30 , the radial wavelength of these waves decreases , and their overlap with the tidal potential is diminished . from equation 69 of paper ii , we find an approximate scaling @xmath116 for @xmath87 .",
    "therefore the retrograde g - waves provide a miniscule tidal torque at large values of @xmath30 .",
    "however , as the importance of the retrograde g - waves falls off for @xmath117 , the @xmath45 , @xmath60 branch of r - waves replace them and become the dominant form of tidal dissipation .",
    "figure [ wdrotl2m2r ] shows that the r - waves create a tidal response analagous to the pro - grade g - waves , with similar resonant ridges , and similar values of @xmath100 ( although note the different plot range in figure [ wdrotl2m2r ] , as we have only plotted the region with @xmath118 where the eigenvalue @xmath23 is positive ) .",
    "this is not too surprising , since we showed in section [ hough ] that the @xmath45 r - waves behave like g - waves for large values of @xmath30 .",
    "figure [ wdrot2 ] shows the dimensionless tidal torque @xmath100 as a function of dimensionless orbital and spin frequency ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) .",
    "the diagonal dark blue slice through the middle of the plot is the locus of points where spin and orbit are nearly synchronized such that @xmath121 , and lies outside of the range of our calculations .",
    "the top - left half of the plot represents super - synchronous rotation where retrograde waves cause tidal dissipation , while the bottom right represents sub - synchronous rotation where prograde waves operate .",
    "the r - waves operate in the narrow slice just above the diagonal .",
    "it is evident from this plot that tidal dissipation is not symmetric across the line @xmath122 , as it would be in the absence of the coriolis force . in the r - wave region ,",
    "tidal dissipation is generally stronger than it is for the same value of @xmath123 corresponding to prograde g - waves , primarily because the r - waves have smaller values of @xmath23 and thus longer wave lengths , making them couple more effectively to the tidal potential .",
    "conversely , in the retrograde g - wave region where @xmath124 ( which appears as the blue slice above the r - wave region ) , neither r - waves nor g - waves are effective in generating tidal dissipation ( although a precise understanding of the nature of tidal dissipation in this regions remains hampered by our use of the traditional approximation ) .        finally , we plot the tidal torque in terms of an effective tidal @xmath101 in figure [ wdrot3 ] , as a function of the wd orbital period @xmath125 and spin period @xmath126 . in a similar fashion to figure [ wdrot2 ] , the prograde g - waves occupy the upper left part of the figure , the retrograde g - waves occupy the lower right part , and the retrograde r - waves occupy the sliver just below the synchronization slice ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "we can see that the effective tidal @xmath101 varies by many orders of magnitude in the parameter space investigated , and choosing a single value of @xmath101 to apply to tidal interactions in wds is a naive procedure .",
    "nonetheless , as discussed in papers ii and iv , the combined spin and orbital evolution of a compact wd binary may lead to a scenario in which the tidal forcing frequency @xmath3 and effective value of @xmath101 remain nearly constant as the wd orbit decays and the wd is spun up to near synchronization .",
    "we therefore perform orbital evolution calculations similar to those of papers ii and iv , only with @xmath100 now dependent on both @xmath3 and @xmath30 .",
    "the results are shown by the black and white lines in figures [ wdrot2 ] and [ wdrot3 ] , for an equal mass ( @xmath128 ) wd binary with no initial spin ( @xmath129 ) and initial orbital period of @xmath130 .",

    ", the evolutionary tracks in figures [ wdrot2 ] and [ wdrot3 ] trace out nearly constant values of @xmath3 , with a corresponding value of @xmath132 .",
    "we have examined the effect of the coriolis force on the excitation of dynamical tides in rotating stars , with specific application to white dwarfs in compact binary systems . in particular , we study the dependence of the tidal dissipation on the tidal forcing frequency @xmath133 and rotational parameter @xmath98 . we utilize the traditional approximation to examine the effect of the coriolis force , which applies well to the gravito - inertial waves important for tidal dissipation in wds .",
    "as one might expect , the coriolis force is negligible when @xmath55 and important when @xmath31 .",
    "there are four primary effects of the coriolis force .",
    "first , it alters the angular profile of g - waves propagating in stars , changing their effective angular wavenumber @xmath23 and their angular overlap with the tidal potential .",
    "second , the changing value of @xmath23 also changes the radial wavelength of the waves , modifying their radial overlap with the tidal potential .",
    "third , the coriolis force introduces new classes of waves ( inertial waves and r - waves ) which rotationally mix with g - waves and provide strong tidal dissipation in certain regions of parameter space .",
    "fourth , the coupling of the equilibrium tidal distortion with the coriolis force introduces new tidal forcing terms , which dominate the tidal response of the star when @xmath57 .",
    "we find that the coriolis force has a small qualitative effect on tidal dynamics in sub - synchronous wds in which prograde g - waves create most of the tidal torque .",
    "for these waves , the value of @xmath23 is not very dependent on @xmath30 , and thus the angular and radial structure of the waves is not strongly affected .",
    "moreover , in the traditional approximation , no prograde r - wave branches obtain positive values of @xmath23 , and thus there are no additional types of prograde waves that can propagate through the stably stratified interiors of wds and cause tidal dissipation .    by contrast , the coriolis force has a large effect on the tidal dynamics of super - synchronous wds in which retrograde g - waves and r - waves dominate the tidal torque .",
    "the retrograde @xmath37 , @xmath60 g - waves ( which correspond to @xmath134 , @xmath60 waves for a slowly spinning star ) that dominate tidal dissipation at small values of @xmath30 are strongly altered by the coriolis force .",
    "their angular wave number increases as @xmath135 , causing their radial wavelength to decrease , strongly reducing their overlap with the tidal potential and making them irrelevant for tidal dissipation when @xmath57 .",
    "however , the coriolis force also introduces an r - wave branch of solutions for @xmath43 , which obtains positive @xmath23 for @xmath136 ( for the @xmath45 r - waves , under the traditional approximation ) , leading to g - wave - like behavior .",
    "the r - waves maintain a small but positive value of @xmath23 for @xmath57 , allowing them to couple strongly with the tidal potential and dominate tidal dissipation in this region of parameter space .",
    "the above mentioned waves have also been identified in previous works . in the language of pantillon",
    "et al . ( 2007 ) and mathis et al . (",
    "2008 ) , the prograde ( @xmath58 , @xmath37 ) waves are the @xmath137 kelvin waves ( note the opposite definition of the sign of @xmath4 in those works ) .",

    "the yanai waves discussed in the above works are anti - symmetric across the equator and thus not relevant to our problem , but may be relevant for tidal dissipation when the spin and orbital axes are misaligned .",
    "it is also important to address the limitations of the traditional approximation , namely , that it does not accurately characterize the oscillation mode spectrum of a star for @xmath43 , as pointed out by mathis et al .",

    "it may be possible that modes similar to the @xmath141 and @xmath142 modes of dintrans et al .",
    "1999 can exist near the core of the star where @xmath143 . ] for @xmath43 , the oscillation equations become of a mixed hyperbolic and elliptic type , with the solutions exhibiting wave attractors such that the waves are focused onto rays where dissipation becomes very large .",
    "we have partially circumvented this problem because we consider outgoing waves which are not reflected from an outer boundary , and which can not exhibit the periodic orbits and singularities discussed in dintrans et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . since the solutions we consider for @xmath43 do not directly violate any of the assumptions of the traditional approximation ( this applies to the r - wave branch so long as we consider regions with a positive eigenvalue @xmath23 )",
    ", it appears that our results remain qualitatively and quantitatively accurate .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that additional forms of dissipation exist , e.g. , due to dynamical tides composed of waves which are able to reflect near the surface of the wd and are focused onto wave attractors .",
    "we have used our results to calculate the orbital and spin evolution of wds in tight binary systems . since the coriolis force does not strongly modify the prograde g - waves that induce tidal dissipation in sub - synchronously rotating inspiraling wds , the general conclusions of papers ii - iv and burkart et al .",
    "( 2013 ) remain valid .",
    "thus , compact wds whose orbits decay via gravitational radiation should be spun up nearly to synchronization by the time roche - lobe overflow occurs , with the tidal forcing frequency @xmath3 and effective tidal @xmath101 remaining nearly constant for orbital periods less than approximately 1 hour .",
    "we can also speculate on the tidal dynamics of a wd accreting material from a companion such that the wd begins to spin super - synchronously .",
    "our analysis indicates that the retrograde r - wave branch is capable of producing strong tidal dissipation as the wd is spun up and the tidal forcing frequency @xmath123 increases .",
    "thus , we do not expect wds accreting in compact systems ( e.g. , am cvn systems ) to be spun up to near break up , as tidal dissipation will likely transfer some of the accreted angular momentum back to the orbit of the donor star .",

    "the time derivative of the angular momentum of any fluid element is zero if there is no wave dissipation within the volume ( goldreich & nicholson 1989a ) as shown explicitly in section [ dep ] .",

    "as we will see below , the manifestation of these problems is the divergence of the dynamical tide solution at the center of the star , which is obviously unphysical .",
    "the oscillation equations [ dp ] and [ dxir ] take the form at the center of the star ( where @xmath184 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 , with @xmath190 the central density ) : @xmath191 imposing a frobenius expansion such that @xmath192 , @xmath193 , and defining @xmath194 , we have [ dpa1 ] p^dyn _ r^dyn + h_klm u_c r^l-1 + u_c r^l-1 , [ dxira1 ] _",
    "r^dyn p^dyn - ( l+1 ) h_klm u_c r^l-2 - g_klm u_c r^l-2 .",
    "these equations have both particular ( forced ) solutions and homogeneous ( free ) solutions .",
    "the forced solutions have @xmath195 and thus vanish near the origin .",
    "the free solution satisfies [ dpa2 ] p^dyn _ r^dyn , [ dxira2 ] _",
    "r^dyn p^dyn , which requires [ alpha ] ^2 + 3 + ( 2 - _ k ) = 0 .",
    "the solutions of this quadratic equation are [ alpha2 ] = - .",
    "if @xmath196 , there exists a regular solution with @xmath197 , allowing one to set @xmath198 at @xmath199 .",
    "however , if @xmath200 there is no solution for which @xmath197 , and thus there exists no regular solution at @xmath199 .",
    "any solution of equations [ dp ] and [ dxir ] for @xmath200 therefore diverges near the origin .",
    "as stated above , this unphysical divergence can be attributed to the breakdown of the traditional approximation near the origin .",
    "this issue is especially worrisome for the @xmath45 , @xmath60 r - waves for which @xmath201 for all values of @xmath30 . in practice , when computing a solution with @xmath200 , we choose the positive solution of equation [ alpha2 ] and use for our inner boundary condition the relation [ inbc ] r_in ^2 _",
    "r^dyn = ( + 1 ) p^dyn , computed at some very small vale of @xmath202 .",
    "we find that the choice of @xmath202 does not affect the solution near the outer boundary , nor does it affect computed values of @xmath100 .",
    "although this method can not be used to characterize the dynamical tide solution near the origin , we conclude that it yields accurate solutions away from the origin where the traditional approximation is valid ."

    "<S> tidal interactions play an important role in the evolution and ultimate fate of compact white dwarf ( wd ) binaries . not only do tides affect the pre - merger state ( such as temperature and rotation rate ) of the wds , but they may also determine which systems merge and which undergo stable mass transfer . in this paper , we attempt to quantify the effects of rotation on tidal angular momentum transport in binary stars , with specific calculations applied to wd stellar models . we incorporate the effect of rotation using the traditional approximation , in which the dynamically excited gravity waves within the wds are transformed into gravito - inertial hough waves . </S>",
    "<S> the coriolis force has only a minor effect on prograde gravity waves , and previous results predicting the tidal spin - up and heating of inspiraling wds are not significantly modified . </S>",

    "<S> we identify new dynamical tidal forcing terms that arise from a proper separation of the equilibrium and dynamical tide components ; these new forcing terms are very important for systems near synchronous rotation . </S>",
