    "studying the thermodynamic properties of black holes is often regarded as a fundamental step towards quantizing gravity .",
    "indeed , the realization that a black hole s entropy is related to its area is at the root of the gauge / gravity correspondence which forms the basis of much modern research .",
    "although most of the literature focuses on dualities between conformal field theories and anti de sitter space  and to a lesser extent on extremal kerr and similar black holes  it is expected that a much wider range of spacetimes embody a holographic principle of a similar nature .",
    "as we study more general classes of spacetimes , we might gain access to more general classes of field theories .",
    "as such , it is imperative to develop tools to study the thermodynamics of spacetimes for which the standard methods , such as the wick rotation , may not be appropriate .",
    "+   + a particular approach to study hawking radiation , called the tunneling method , has recently garnered a lot of attention . not only does it paint a very physical picture of hawking radiation  that of quantum fields tunneling through the event horizon  but it is also local in nature .",
    "this property makes the technique versatile enough to apply to a wide range of black holes , such as embedded black holes in de sitter spacetimes . as such",
    ", it has been used to investigate the thermodynamics of a wide variety of spacetimes , many of which previously difficult or impossible to study .",
    "they include kerr - newman @xcite , black rings @xcite , taub - nut @xcite , ads black holes @xcite , btz @xcite , vaidya @xcite , dynamical black holes @xcite , kerr - gdel @xcite , and desitter horizons @xcite , as well as generic weakly isolated horizons @xcite .",
    "+   + another particularly important advantage of the tunneling approach is its ability to consider quantum fields explicitly . while it has so far only been used to study scalars  including some coupled to a @xmath1 gauge field @xcite  spin @xmath2 @xcite and higher - spin @xcite fermions , and bosons @xcite , one can expect the method to eventually mature and be used to study , for example , fields whose equations of motion come from effective string theoretic actions .",
    "+   + the tunneling method has a rich history . based on the earlier works of volovik @xcite , who analyzed properties of superfluidic helium-3 related to quantum tunneling ,",
    "kraus and wilczek @xcite studied hawking radiation semiclassically by studying modes of the field near the event horizon .",
    "this was later generalized as a tunneling phenomenon by parikh and wilczek @xcite .",
    "padmanabhan and his collaborators finally developed a second flavour of this method @xcite  this is the version we will use here  which is now starting to become well understood .",
    "+   + the idea behind the method can easily be illustrated using a free massless scalar field being emitted from a schwarzschild black hole . writing the field @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is its action , the field equations reduce to first order in @xmath5 to the hamilton - jacobi equations : @xmath6 . in order to solve this equation",
    ", we will need to make use of the spacetime symmetries , namely that @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants of motion .",
    "hence , we may impose that the action obeys the ansatz @xmath10 , which forces the hamilton - jacobi equations to reduce to @xmath11 .",
    "finally , this means that the black hole s temperature is given by @xmath12 , since the field s emission rate is given by @xmath13 the constant curvature black hole @xcite can be thought of as a @xmath14 dimensional extension to the btz black hole , and was found by identifying points in anti - desitter spacetime . using schwarzschild - like coordinates @xcite , the line element can be written as @xmath15 + \\frac{dr^2}{f^2(r ) } + r^2 d \\phi^2 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 the horizon is located at @xmath17 .",
    "because of its non - standard asymptotic limit , all conserved charges diverge . to make sense of the global charges , baados initially studied the thermodynamics of the ccbh by embedding it in a chern - simons supergravity theory .",
    "later , using quasi - local thermodynamic variables to tame the divergences , creighton and mann @xcite studied the thermodynamics in a general relativistic setting , where they showed that the first law of thermodynamics still holds .",
    "+   + we study this type of black hole for two reasons .",
    "first , black holes with an unusual topology  the ccbh is @xmath18 instead of the more usual @xmath19  might be dual to interesting field theories , and form prime candidates for spacetimes which should be fully understood .",
    "in particular , cai @xcite has shown that the five dimensional ccbh is dual to @xmath0 super - yang - mills .",
    "second , this black hole will highlight a connection between the tunneling method and near - horizon symmetries which is often overlooked ; indeed , it is often outright assumed , such as in kerr @xcite , kerr - ads @xcite and taub - nut - ads @xcite , that the outgoing radiation is purely radial near the horizon : the quantum field tunnels out with constant @xmath20 .",
    "yet this connection is crucial : these near - horizon symmetries are precisely those which might suggest the existence of a conformal field theory at the horizon . +   +",
    "we will begin by calculating the hawking temperature of the ccbh using the wick rotation method , for comparison purposes .",
    "then , we will apply the tunneling method to the problem and show that one must account for the near - horizon symmetries of the black hole in order to guess the right form of the action s ansatz .",
    "this will lead us to the black hole s temperature .",
    "because the ccbh is a fairly simple spacetime , its temperature can easily be calculated using a wick rotation . this will provide us with a reference against which to compare the temperature we will calculate using the tunneling method . using the ccbh metric in the form of equation @xmath21 , we notice that we require @xmath22 to have a period of @xmath23 in order to avoid a conical singularity in the euclideanized metric ; this association means that the term in square brackets is simply the line element of a two - sphere .",
    "hence , the inverse temperature is @xmath24 .",
    "+   + note that if we denote the timelike killing vector by @xmath25 , then @xmath26 ; this means that the surface gravity is @xmath27 and , therefore , @xmath24 once again .",
    "+   + because our spacetime is not asymptotically flat , we should for clarity redshift the inverse temperature by multiplying by @xmath28 .",
    "the temperature observed by an observer located at @xmath29 is finally given by @xmath30      in contrast with the above calculations , the tunneling approach to hawking radiation has a direct physical interpretation : that of a quantum field tunneling through an event horizon .",
    "for completeness , we will simultaneously consider both the emission of a free scalar field @xmath31 , obeying the klein - gordon equation , and the emission of a free fermion field @xmath32 .",
    "in general , the equations of motion for this fermion should be given by the rarita - schwinger equations @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that both types of fields are emitted from black holes at the same rate , thus yielding the same hawking temperature .",
    "therefore , we will assume that our fermions obey the dirac equation , and we can write : @xmath33 where the covariant derivative @xmath34 acting on the fermion field is defined by @xmath35.\\ ] ] the @xmath36 matrices satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "we will write them in the form @xmath38 , where we ve introduced tetrads satisfying @xmath39 as well as the @xmath40 matrices which correspond to the flat - space dirac matrices in the basis @xmath41 the @xmath42 correspond to the standard pauli matrices : @xmath43 using the wkb approximation , we impose that our fields be proportional to @xmath44 , where @xmath4 is the action . for the scalar field",
    ", this means that @xmath45 . for the fermion , we focus on the spin - up case ( the spin - down case being effectively identical ) and denote the positive - spin eigenvector of @xmath46 by @xmath47 . the field",
    "@xmath32 then takes the form @xmath48 e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } i_{\\uparrow}(x^\\mu ) } = \\left [   \\begin{array } { c }      a(x^\\mu)\\\\      0\\\\      b(x^\\mu)\\\\      0   \\end{array } \\right ] e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } i_{\\uparrow}(x^\\mu)}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] because the metric is invariant under translations over @xmath49 and @xmath31 , we know that @xmath50 and @xmath51 will be conserved quantities . as such , our action will take the form @xmath52 then , inputting the fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 into their respective equations of motion @xmath53 and using equation @xmath54 , we find for the scalar @xmath55 and for the fermion : @xmath56 where we approximated to leading order in @xmath5 and subsequently set @xmath5 to unity . to this order",
    ", we effectively have @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , derivatives of @xmath58 and @xmath59 are also of higher order in @xmath5 , making @xmath58 and @xmath59 effectively constant .",
    "although at first glance this approximation appears to remove a lot of interesting physics , it has recently been shown that the terms of higher order in @xmath5 will generate no contribution to the hawking temperature @xcite .",
    "as such , we are well justified in truncating our expressions to leading order in @xmath5 .",
    "+   + near the horizon , @xmath60 goes to zero , such that the mass term does not contribute .",
    "this allows us to rewrite the fermion equations as @xmath61 while the equations for the scalar are still given by equation @xmath62 ; equations of the same form as @xmath63 are also found in multiple other spacetimes @xcite .",
    "there , the next step is to assume that the hawking radiation is purely radial : that is , @xmath64 during the tunneling process .",
    "unfortunately , this assumption , which is often made without justification , does not work in the case of the ccbh .",
    "indeed , it implies that @xmath65 will yield no contribution to @xmath66 , and integrating @xmath67 across the horizon , for both the scalar and the fermion , will yield @xmath68 this expression can not be correct , as it would ultimately imply that the hawking temperature depends on the emission coordinate @xmath69 ( which describes where on the horizon the field has been emitted from ) , which contradicts our previous calculations from equation @xmath70 ( where the hawking temperature only depended on the observer s position ) .",
    "+   + in order to proceed forward , we need to understand how to decompose this @xmath71 into two functions , each depending on only one variable . in that spirit , we will take a short detour to discuss near - horizon symmetries before coming back to these field equations later . as a first step , we take the near horizon limit and rewrite the line element , initially given by equation @xmath21 , into a more explicit form : @xmath72 where we ve introduced the coordinates @xmath73 note that the horizon is now located at @xmath74 .",
    "this line element corresponds to an observer with constant acceleration in minkowski space .",
    "indeed , if we introduce the coordinates @xmath75 and @xmath76 , then the near - horizon line element becomes @xmath77 the near - horizon symmetries are now immediately obvious , and it is clear that @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are killing vectors .",
    "we can therefore define three conserved quantities @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 which correspond to the energy of the emitted field , as well as its momentum along the @xmath84 and @xmath85 directions .",
    "therefore , near the horizon , the action will have the form @xmath86 where , on the second line , we ve written the near - horizon coordinates @xmath87 in terms of the general coordinates @xmath88 from equation @xmath21 .",
    "it is important to note that this construction is only valid in the near - horizon limit .",
    "we are , however , justified in taking such a limit because of the nature of the tunneling method . indeed , as we will see in the next section , all contributions to the hawking temperature come from discontinuities located directly at the horizon .",
    "this is precisely the power of the tunneling method : because the near - horizon geometry is so much simpler than the bulk geometry , additional symmetries arise which greatly simplify the field equations that we are trying to solve .",
    "+   + the field should be understood not as being emitted radially along the @xmath89 direction while keeping @xmath90 constant , but as being emitted along the @xmath91 direction keeping @xmath92 constant . as can be seen in figure [ fig : figure ]",
    ", one can think of the ccbh as a sphere with an event horizon at @xmath74 with additional coordinate singularities at @xmath93 and @xmath94 . while @xmath95 parametrizes the @xmath17 horizon",
    ", @xmath96 corresponds to the distance from the axisymmetry axis which itself forms a coordinate singularity .",
    "it is from this axisymmetric line that the particles will be emitted .",
    "a discussion of the ccbh instanton can also be found in @xcite . +   +     suppressed .",
    "the axisymmetric axis , formed by the @xmath93 and @xmath94 lines , represents the horizon .",
    "the radiation emitted from this black hole should follow the coordinate @xmath97.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    knowing that our action takes the simple form from equation @xmath98 , we can return to our field equations .",
    "the scalar field still obeys the same equation @xmath62 as before : @xmath99 for the fermion , on the other hand , we should rotate the field because we ve modified the definition of our radial coordinate .",
    "however , we can save ourselves from having to do this by being clever .",
    "indeed , the fermion field will now look like @xmath100 e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } i_{\\uparrow}(x^\\mu)};\\ ] ] inputting this into the dirac equation will yield a system of equation similar to equation @xmath101 .",
    "however , notice that because we are working in a first - order approximation , all these equations are linear in @xmath32 ( interestingly , this trick works even without truncating to first order in @xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "writing the equations in matrix form @xmath102 , therefore , we demand that the determinant of @xmath103 vanishes ; if it did not , then the only solution would be @xmath104 .",
    "this gives the equation @xmath105 which is the same equation as that for the scalar field @xmath106 .",
    "using the ansatz for the action @xmath98 into these equations of motion @xmath106 , we get @xmath107 ^ 2 + j_1 ^ 2 + \\frac{j_2 ^ 2}{r^2 } + m^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath108 denotes the derivative of @xmath109 with respect to its entire argument . because we are working near the horizon , @xmath60 goes to zero such that the first two terms diverge while the last three are finite .",
    "hence , @xmath110 where the @xmath111 and @xmath112 correspond to outgoing and infalling radiation , respectively .",
    "more details on this correspondence can be found in section 3 of @xcite .",
    "given the `` radial '' derivative of the action , given by equation @xmath113 , it is straightforward to calculate the imaginary part of the action , which is related to the hawking temperature through the tunneling probability @xmath114 .",
    "while there are a number of techniques which have been introduced for this step @xcite , we will here follow the ideas recently summarized in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is found that there are two separate contributions to the imaginary part of the action : one coming from the discontinuity of the time coordinate @xmath115 , and another coming from a pole , at the horizon , which arises when integrating the radial part of the action .",
    "the temperature is ultimately given by the expression @xmath116 where the @xmath117 must each be integrated along an infinitesimal quarter - circle path around the pole at the horizon @xcite , such that the result of the integration will be @xmath118 times the residue at the pole . hence : @xmath119 next , we need to calculate the jump in the time coordinate across the horizon @xmath115 . notice that the line element defined by @xmath120 is that of an accelerated observer in minkowski space following the path @xmath121 outside the horizon , whereas inside the horizon , we need to interchange @xmath122 to account for the timelike coordinate becoming spacelike as the horizon is crossed .",
    "thus , when we cross the horizon , we must have @xmath123 in order to get @xmath124 .",
    "the time discontinuity is therefore @xmath125 .",
    "+   + we can combine this result with equations @xmath126 and @xmath127 to find the hawking temperature : @xmath128 redshifting to account for the observer s position , this becomes @xmath129 which is the same temperature as the one found using the wick rotation method @xmath70 .",
    "we have calculated the first - order hawking temperature for fermions and scalars emitted from the constant curvature black hole by considering the process as a semi - classical tunneling phenomenon across the event horizon .",
    "this spacetime emphasizes a few interesting aspects of the tunneling method which are not obvious in simpler black hole spacetimes , such as the necessity to carefully choose an ansatz for the action based on the symmetries of the near - horizon geometry .",
    "this suggests a link between this technique and gauge / gravity dualities in black hole spacetimes , which also rely on these symmetries , that should be the focus of further studies .",
    "moreover , our calculation serves as a practical demonstration of a new idea @xcite for accounting for the factor of 2 problem  by which the tunneling method yielded differing emission probabilities depending on the type of coordinates used  by considering the discontinuity of the time coordinate across the event horizon .",
