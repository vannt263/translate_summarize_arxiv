    "a geodesic triangle in riemannian geometry and more generally in metric geometry a figure consisting of three different points together with the pairwise - connecting geodesic curves .",
    "the points are known as the vertices , while the geodesic curves are known as the sides of the triangle .    in the geometries of constant curvature @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4",
    "the well - known sums of the interior angles of geodesic triangles characterize the space .",
    "it is related to the gauss - bonnet theorem which states that the integral of the gauss curvature on a compact @xmath5-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath6 is equal to @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the euler characteristic of @xmath6 .",
    "this theorem has a generalization to any compact even - dimensional riemannian manifold ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite )",
    ".    however , in the other @xmath9-dimensional homogeneous maximal riemann spaces ( thurston geometries ) there are few results concerning the angle sums of geodesic triangles .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study similar question in the other five thurston geometries , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath0 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "in @xcite we investigated the angle sum of translation and geodesic triangles in @xmath12 geometry and proved that the possible sum of the internal angles in a translation triangle must be greater or equal than @xmath1 .",
    "however , in geodesic triangles this sum is less , greater or equal to @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we consider the analogous problem in @xmath0 geometry .",
    "we note here , that nowadays the @xmath0 geometry is a widely investigated space concerning the interesting surfaces , tilings , geodesic and translation ball packings ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references given there ) .    in @xcite k.  brodaczewska showed , that sum of the interior angles of translation triangles of the @xmath0 space is larger than @xmath1 .    now , we are interested in _ geodesic triangles _ in @xmath0 space that is one of the eight thurston geometries @xcite . in section 2",
    "we describe the projective model of @xmath0 and we shall use its standard riemannian metric obtained by pull back transform to the infinitesimal arc - length - square at the origin .",
    "we also describe the isometry group of @xmath0 , give an overview about geodesic curves .    in section 3 we study the @xmath0 geodesic triangles and prove the interior angle sum of a geodesic triangle in @xmath0 geometry can be larger , equal or less than @xmath1 .",
    "in this section we summarize the significant notions and denotations of the @xmath0 geometry ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0 geometry is a homogeneous 3-space derived from the famous real matrix group @xmath14 discovered by w.  heisenberg .",
    "the lie theory with the methode of the projective geometry makes possible to investigate and to describe this topic .",
    "the left ( row - column ) multiplication of heisenberg matrices @xmath15 defines `` translations '' @xmath16 on the points of the space @xmath17 .",
    "these translations are not commutative in general . the matrices @xmath18 of the form @xmath19 constitute the one parametric centre , i.e. each of its elements commutes with all elements of @xmath20 .",
    "the elements of @xmath21 are called _",
    "fibre translations_. @xmath0 geometry of the heisenberg group can be projectively ( affinely ) interpreted by the `` right translations '' on points as the matrix formula @xmath22 shows , according to ( 2.1 ) .",
    "here we consider @xmath20 as projective collineation group with right actions in homogeneous coordinates .",
    "we will use the cartesian homogeneous coordinate simplex @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26  @xmath27 @xmath28 which is distinguished by an origin @xmath29 and by the ideal points of coordinate axes , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 with @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 defines a point @xmath33 of the projective 3-sphere @xmath34 ( or that of the projective space @xmath35 where opposite rays @xmath36 and @xmath37 are identified ) .",
    "the dual system @xmath38 describes the simplex planes , especially the plane at infinity @xmath39 , and generally , @xmath40 defines a plane @xmath41 of @xmath34 ( or that of @xmath35 ) .",
    "thus @xmath42 defines the incidence of point @xmath33 and plane @xmath41 .",
    "thus * nil * can be visualized in the affine 3-space @xmath43 ( so in @xmath44 ) as well .    in this context e. molnr @xcite",
    "has derived the well - known infinitesimal arc - length square invariant under translations @xmath45 at any point of @xmath0 as follows @xmath46 hence we get the symmetric metric tensor field @xmath47 on @xmath0 by components @xmath48 , furthermore its inverse : @xmath49 the translation group @xmath20 defined by formula ( 2.3 ) can be extended to a larger group @xmath50 of collineations , preserving the fibering , that will be equivalent to the ( orientation preserving ) isometry group of @xmath0 . in @xcite e.  molnr",
    "has shown that a rotation trough angle @xmath51 about the @xmath52-axis at the origin , as isometry of @xmath0 , keeping invariant the riemann metric everywhere , will be a quadratic mapping in @xmath53 to @xmath52-image @xmath54 as follows : @xmath55 this rotation formula , however , is conjugate by the quadratic mapping @xmath56 @xmath57 i.e. to the linear rotation formula",
    "this quadratic conjugacy modifies the @xmath0 translations in ( 2.3 ) , as well .",
    "we shall use the following important classification theorem .    1 .",
    "any group of @xmath0 isometries , containing a 3-dimensional translation lattice , is conjugate by the quadratic mapping in ( 2.5 ) to an affine group of the affine ( or euclidean ) space @xmath58 whose projection onto the ( x , y ) plane is an isometry group of @xmath59 .",
    "such an affine group preserves a plane @xmath60 point polarity of signature @xmath61 .",
    "2 .   of course , the involutive line reflection about the @xmath62 axis @xmath63 preserving the riemann metric , and its conjugates by the above isometries in @xmath64 ( those of the identity component ) are also @xmath0-isometries",
    ". there does not exist orientation reversing @xmath0-isometry .",
