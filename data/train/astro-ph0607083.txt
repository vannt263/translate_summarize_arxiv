    "one of the main limiting factors in determining the masses of the compact objects in low - mass x - ray binaries is uncertainty in the fraction of the infrared light that is produced by the companion star ( e.g. , hynes , robinson , & bitner 2005 ) .",
    "when lmxbs are accreting at low rates , the optical and infrared light from these systems is dominated by the companion stars , so their mass functions can be measured to high accuracy based on the doppler motion of the companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the inclination then must be constrained by modeling the modulations in the optical and infrared light curves that are produced by the varying aspect of the distorted , roche - lobe - filling companion . generally ,",
    "the contribution of the accretion disk to the optical and near - infrared emission is uncertain , and varying the fraction of the light that is assumed to be produced by the accretion disk can lead to differences of a factor of 2 in the derived mass of a compact object ( e.g. , gelino , harrison , & orosz 2001 ) .",
    "fortunately , the broad - band spectrum of a multi - temperature accretion disk is significantly flatter than that of a stellar photosphere , so mid - infrared observations could constrain the relative contributions of the two components .",
    "however , the spectra of lmxbs in the mid - infrared have not been well studied , and several indirect lines of evidence suggest that these systems might contain circumbinary material that could emit in the mid - infrared .",
    "gfirst , some of the white dwarf analogs to lmxbs , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , exhibit spectral features that lie at the mean radial velocities of the systems @xcite and excess mid - infrared emission @xcite that could be interpreted as arising in circumbinary material ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , the supernovae that produced the compact objects could have left fall - back disks around the binaries .",
    "indeed , the first fall - back disk has recently been found around a young , highly - magnetized neutron star ( wang , chakrabarty , & kaplan 2006 ) .",
    "third , the planets around the isolated millisecond pulsar psr 1257@xmath412 @xcite could not have survived the supernova that produced the neutron star , and must have formed afterward ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "millisecond pulsars are usually assumed to have been spun up by accretion as lmxbs , in which case planets could form from material present during the binary phase . therefore , to search for evidence of circumbinary material ,",
    "we have observed four nearby , quiescent lmxbs with the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "we chose the lmxbs in our sample to be detectable with _ spitzer _  if they contained optically - thick circumbinary disks passively illuminated by the mass donor stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and below ) .",
    "based on a simple model , we chose sources with : ( 1 ) @xmath5 magnitudes brighter than 17 , ( 2 ) locations more than @xmath6 in projection from the galactic center , and ( 3 ) no 2mass sources within 5  that were brighter than our targets . in table [ tab : targets ] , we list the positions , the orbital periods , estimates of the primary masses , the spectral types of the companions , and the quiescent @xmath5 magnitudes of the four systems in our sample ( see the table notes for references ) .",
    "our measurements were taken in the 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath0 m bands with infrared array camera ( irac ) , and in the 24 @xmath0 m band with the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ; tab .",
    "[ tab : fluxes ] ) .",
    "we used the post - basic - calibration data provided by the _ spitzer _  science center ( ssc ) for most of our analysis .",
    "however , the mips image of a 0620@xmath100 contained latent features with a low spatial frequency and a @xmath72% amplitude that were left by a previous observation of a bright , extended source .",
    "we corrected the image by creating a flat field from the median of the individual dithered images , dividing each snapshot by the flat , and re - creating the mosaicked image using the script provided by the ssc .",

    "none of the fluxes were obtained simultaneously , so when comparing the flux measurements in figure  [ fig : sed ] one can only expect them to be self - consistent to within @xmath1430% . to estimate the contributions of the companions to the spectra , we have obtained model stellar spectra computed with the next - generation phoenix code ( kindly provided by t. barman ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that correspond to the temperatures and radii of the spectral types in table  [ tab : targets ] .",
    "we have estimated the contribution of the accretion disk using a standard @xcite model , assuming the disk extends out to the tidal truncation radius ( @xmath1560% of the binary separation ; frank , king , & raine 1992 ) , is inclined by 60@xmath16  to our line of sight , and has the largest accretion rate that is consistent with the optical photometry ( see the caption of fig .  [ fig : sed ] for values ) . we have confirmed that our conclusions are robust against changing the assumed spectral types of the companions within the values reported in the literature , and against varying the parameters of the accretion disk so long as the models are consistent with the optical photometry .",
    "we find that the spectrum of cen x-4 is consistent with that expected for the companion star , with a possible contribution at long wavelengths from the accretion disk .",
    "there are clear excesses of mid - infrared flux above that expected from the companions of a 0620 - 00 , gs 2023 + 338 , and xte j1118 + 480 . in order to conservatively estimate the amounts of the mid - infrared fluxes that are not produced by the companions",
    ", we computed the maximum contributions of the companions photospheres by normalizing the model stellar spectra to match the de - reddened @xmath5 fluxes , and reported the difference between the predicted and observed mid - infrared fluxes as the excesses in table [ tab : fluxes ] ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "several lmxbs have now been detected in outburst in the mid - infrared ( e.g. , smith , beall , & swain 1990 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these are the first detections of quiescent systems . in outburst , the mid - infrared emission could originate from an accretion disk in which @xmath18 g s@xmath19 @xcite , from free - free emission in a strong wind driven from the accretion disk @xcite , or from radio jets with flat spectra extending to infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we use these hypotheses as a starting point for understanding the mid - infrared emission from our sample of quiescent lmxbs",
    ".    the mid - infrared excess from gs 2023 + 338 could originate in an accretion disk , because the 2.224 @xmath0 m fluxes in figure  [ fig : sed ] follow the @xmath20 law that one would expect from the rayleigh - jeans tail of a black body .",
    "we find that our model for a viscously - heated accretion disk @xcite from  2 adequately describes the excess mid - infrared flux from gs 2023 + 338 in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "in contrast , the 424 @xmath0 m fluxes from a 0620@xmath100 and xte j1118 + 480 do not follow the @xmath21 law expected for the rayleigh - jeans tail of a blackbody , because there is too much flux at 8 @xmath0 m . a blackbody spectrum that peaks near 8 @xmath0 m would have a temperature of only 640 k. for these two sources , we plot blackbody spectra that match the peak of the mid - infrared excesses ( @xmath22 ) in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the sum of the spectra of stellar photospheres and optically - thick blackbodies match the observed mid - infrared fluxes well .",
    "however , the inferred emitting areas are large compared to the binary separations . for a planck spectrum , the solid angles of the emitting regions correspond to circular radii of @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the distance to the source .",
    "in contrast , the disks will be contained within @xmath1560% of the binary separations @xmath25 , which are given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the orbital period in days , @xmath28 is the mass of the accretor in solar masses , and @xmath29 is the mass ratio of the binary ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . given the fluxes in table [ tab : fluxes ] , we find that the excess mid - infrared emission originates from regions @xmath142 times larger than the orbital separations of gs 2023 + 338 and xte j1118 + 480 , and @xmath304 times larger than the accretion disks .",
    "therefore , the mid - infrared emission is produced in a region that extends beyond the binary orbit .",
    "jets could produce an emitting region larger than the binary orbit , but given the spectra of the mid - infrared excesses we suggest that jets are only minor contributors .",
    "two lmxbs in our sample have recently been detected as radio sources in quiescence : gs 2023 + 338 with flat - spectrum radio emission with an intensity of 350@xmath0jy over the frequency range 1.48.4 ghz @xcite , and a 0620@xmath100 with a radio flux of 50 @xmath0jy at 8.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m excesses from a 0620@xmath100 is equal to the flux in the radio , so it could be produced by a jet with a flat ( @xmath31 , with @xmath32 ) spectrum between the radio and mid - infrared . for gs 2023 + 338 ,",
    "the 24 @xmath0 m flux is slightly lower than the radio flux , which would imply that its jet has a steeper @xmath33 spectrum .",
    "however , the 8 @xmath0 m excesses from a 0620@xmath100 , gs 2023 + 338 , and xte j1118 + 480 are not consistent with a flat - spectrum radio jet , because for xte j1118 + 480 and a 0262@xmath100 they are 4 times larger than the excesses at 24 @xmath0 m , and for gs 2023 + 338 it is 10 times larger .",
    "if we assume the 24 @xmath0 m emission is from a flat - spectrum jet , then it contributes @xmath13 25% to the 8 @xmath0 m flux from xte j1118 + 480 and a 0620@xmath100 , and @xmath1310% from gs 2023 + 338 .",
    "we suggest that the excesses from a 0620@xmath100 and xte j1118 + 480 originate from circumbinary dust that re - processes the light of the companions . to estimate the masses of the dust , we assume it is contained in optically thick disks",
    ". the disks could lie as close to the center of masses of the binaries as 1.7@xmath25 , at which point they would be tidally truncated @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the temperature profile of such disks by assuming they are flat , in which case @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the temperatures and radii of the disks , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the temperatures and radii of the companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using equation  [ eq : orbit_sep ] and the parameters in table  [ tab : targets ] , we would expect the inner edges of the circumbinary disks to have temperatures of @xmath14600 k , which is consistent with our detection of excesses that peak near 8 @xmath0 m .",
    "the lack of excess flux at 24@xmath0 m implies that material does not re - process much stellar light beyond radii @xmath143 times larger than the binary separations .",
    "if we assume the disks are composed of dust with an opacity @xmath39@xmath7300 @xmath40 g@xmath19 at 8 @xmath0 m ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then for them to have an optical depth of @xmath41@xmath71 , the disks would only need to contain @xmath7@xmath2 g of dust . if we assume the emitting material is optically thin , we find dust masses that are similar within a factor of a few ( e.g. , eq .",
    "3 in * ? ? ?",
    "if the gas - to - dust ratio is similar to that of the interstellar medium , @xmath7100 , then the total mass of the circumbinary material could be @xmath7@xmath3 g.",
    "the detection of excess mid - infrared flux from a 0620@xmath100 and xte j1118 + 480 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) provides evidence that circumbinary material is present around some lmxbs , but its spectrum suggests that it will only be detectable in the mid - infrared . the excess emission peaks at 8 @xmath0 m , and if we model it as a single - temperature blackbody , we predict that the circumbinary material produced negligible flux shortward of @xmath143 @xmath0 m",
    ". moreover , the lack excess mid - infrared emission from cen x-4 demonstrates that such material is not ubiquitous .",
    "finally , for gs 2023 + 338 , the mid - infrared emission appears to originate from a hot accretion disk , and the contribution of the accretion disk to the mid - infrared light can be predicted based on the optical measurements ( the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "these results provide reassurance that efforts to determine the inclinations of lmxbs by modeling the ellipsoidal modulations of their infrared and optical light curves are not compromised by the presence of circumbinary material .    for a 0620@xmath100 and xte j1118 + 480",
    ", we suggest that the circumbinary disks are either the remains of fall - back disks produced in the supernovae that formed the compact objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or material injected into circumbinary orbits during the process of mass loss by the roche - lobe filling companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these circumbinary disks contain @xmath7@xmath2 g of dust , which for a standard dust - to - mass ratio of @xmath7100 implies a total mass of @xmath7@xmath3 g. if the disks are produced by matter ejected into circumbinary orbits during the process of mass transfer , then it represents only a tiny fraction of the @xmath7@xmath42 g ( @xmath70.1 @xmath43 ) that will be lost by the companions over the lifetimes of these lmxbs .",
    "alternatively , @xcite have proposed that fall - back disks containing @xmath30@xmath3 g of material could form asteroids and inject them into the magnetospheres of pulsars with a high enough rate to explain the the observed intermittency in their radio pulses .",
    "asteroids might not survive the outbursts of lmxbs @xcite , but the mid - infrared excesses that we have identified could be the remnants of similar fall - back disks",
    ".    however , the circumbinary material is not massive enough either to affect the evolution of the orbital angular momentum of lmxbs ( e.g. , @xmath7@xmath44 g in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or to form planetesimals ( e.g. , @xmath7@xmath45 g in * ? ? ?",
    "as the formation and evolution of circumbinary matter around lmxbs and cvs are considered further , it may be that the paucity of matter around a 0620@xmath100 and xte j1118 + 480 ( and the apparent lack of circumbinary matter around the one neutron star lmxb in our sample , cen x-4 ) may be the most lasting aspect of this result .",
