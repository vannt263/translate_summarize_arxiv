    "our formalism is described in the following sections .",
    "one important limitation of the uv lfs in probing the galaxy build - up in the early universe is dust extinction , which significantly affects the uv luminosities of galaxies .",
    "thanks to deep multi - wavelength photometry with hst , it has become clear that dust extinction evolves with redshift , becoming significantly less important at earlier cosmic times .",
    "thus , the uv lf at high redshift evolves due to two effects : ( _ i _ ) evolution in dust extinction , and ( _ ii _ ) sfr build - up of the underlying galaxy population .",
    "any model of the uv lfs therefore has to disentangle these two effects .",
    "alternatively , we can directly make use of the sfr functions ( sfrf ) , @xmath29 . these provide the number density of galaxies with a given sfr , and",
    "are thus corrected for dust extinction .",
    "following @xcite , we derive the observed sfr functions based on the most recent uv lfs at @xmath30 taken from @xcite , which we correct for dust extinction using the observed uv continuum slopes @xmath31 and their relation with uv extinction @xcite .",
    "the uv continuum slopes are modeled as a function of luminosity using the most recent relations from @xcite . for more details on this approach",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the dust correction effectively shifts the lf to higher luminosities and slightly lowers the volume densities due to the renormalization of the magnitude bins .",
    "the dust - corrected , intrinsic uv luminosities are then converted to sfrs using the following empirical relation ,    @xmath32    and the resulting sfr functions are represented with the typical schechter parameterization , @xmath33    .schechter parameters determined for the sfr functions [ tab : sfrf ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the schechter parameters for the @xmath3 4 - 8 sfr functions are directly related to the schechter function parameters of the uv lf and the slope of the @xmath34 relation ( see sections 2.1 and 2.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "using the most recent uv lfs and uv continuum slope measurements , we thus update the previous sfr functions of @xcite .",

    ", the combination of less evolution in the characteristic luminosity found in newer uv lf results , as well as the consistently redder uv continuum slopes found in updated measurements , result in significantly higher sfrfs compared to the previous analysis , in particular at higher redshift .",
    "we perform the same analysis also for @xmath35 galaxy sfr functions .",
    "these are much more uncertain , given the very large uncertainties in the uv lfs at these redshifts .",
    "also , note that based on the evolution of the uv continuum slope distribution at lower redshift @xcite , the dust correction is expected to be negligible at redshifts @xmath36 8 ; the @xmath3 9 and 10 sfr function parameters are thus directly related to the uncorrected uv lfs at those redshifts .      adopting the approach presented in @xcite , we use the observed , dust - corrected @xmath3 4 - 8 luminosity functions , i.e. sfr functions , to derive an empirical relation between the galaxy sfr and its host halo mass . in this abundance matching method ,",
    "the sfr-@xmath2 relation is calculated by setting the sfr of a galaxy hosted in a halo of mass @xmath2 to be such that the number of galaxies with a star formation rate greater than sfr equals the number of halos with mass greater than @xmath2 at a given epoch :",

    "these can be compared to the dashed lines from @xcite , which were derived using the same procedure , but based on now - outdated uv lfs and @xmath31 distributions ( covering only @xmath50 ) .",
    "the combination of less evolution in the characteristic luminosity found in newer uv lf results as well as the consistently redder uv continuum slopes , result in significantly higher sfrfs compared to the previous analysis , in particular at higher redshift.,width=317 ]    the abundance matching technique , as prescribed in equation ( 3 ) , presupposes that the sfr is a monotonic function of the halo mass .",
    "this is supported by the observed trend that the clustering strength of galaxies at high redshift increases with their uv luminosity , similar to that of the clustering strength of halos increasing with mass @xcite .",
    "hence , a scaling relation that assumes the sfr of a galaxy is a monotonically increasing function of the mass of its host halo is a reasonable starting point .",
    "furthermore , our model assumes a one - to - one correspondence between galaxies and host halos .",
    "this neglects the substructure expected to exist within a halo , comprised mainly of halos that formed at earlier epochs and merged to become subhaloes of more massive hosts @xcite . to include the contribution of this subhalo population and the galaxies they are potentially hosting , we modified the left - hand side of equation ( 3 ) to integrate over the @xmath51 mass function , i.e. the sum of the regular sheth - tormen halo mass function and the unevolved subhalo mass function taken from @xcite .",
    "we found that because values for the subhalo mass function are generally lower than those of the halo mass function , the inclusion of this additional substructure has a negligible effect on the resulting scaling law ; the subhaloes contribution to the expression is most important at the low - mass end , and even there , its inclusion changes the results by @xmath52 10% .",
    "therefore , for the sake of simplicity , we neglect multiple halo occupation and assume that each dark - matter halo hosts a single galaxy .",
    "once the average relation between the sfr and the halo mass are known , we can model the sfr functions assuming a realistic dispersion around the average relation .",
    "we model the probability density for a halo of mass @xmath2 to host a galaxy with a star formation rate @xmath53 to obey a log - normal distribution @xcite , @xmath54 where @xmath19 is the mean sfr-@xmath2 relation derived by averaging the @xmath55 relations obtained for 4 @xmath56 8 over the specified range of redshifts at fixed halo mass .",
    "the variance , @xmath57 , represents the scatter in sfr at a fixed @xmath2 that arises from the stochastic nature of star formation activity .",
    "halos of similar masses can have a range of large - scale environments , merger histories , and central concentrations @xcite .",
    "these conditions , along with interactions with nearby systems can result in different rates of gas accretion and star formation in galaxies . to account for this variance in the sfr-@xmath2 relation , we adopt a constant intrinsic scatter of 0.5 dex .",
    "this choice is motivated by the 0.5 dex scatter in stellar mass at constant sfr found by @xcite , a result further confirmed by @xcite as providing the best statistical fit to observations of the sfr-@xmath2 relation .    the sfr function , @xmath58 ,",
    "can then be obtained by integrating over the probability - weighted number densities of all halos that can achieve the star formation rate sfr within the allowed scatter : @xmath59 note that in the limit of the variance @xmath60 0 , the log - normal probability distribution becomes a delta function and the equation is reduced to the simpler form , @xmath61     +",
    "the curves in the top panel of figure [ fig : sfrplot ] depict the sfr-@xmath2 relations inferred from the observed lf functions at redshifts 4 @xmath56 8 via the abundance matching technique discussed in  2.1 .",
    "the scaling law remains roughly constant within 0.2 dex across this redshift range and is fairly well fit by a double power law with a turnover at a characteristic halo mass of @xmath62 @xmath63 2@xmath6410@xmath65 m@xmath66 .",
    "averaging the relations over @xmath3 4 - 8 at a fixed halo mass , we obtain a mean scaling law , @xmath19 ( solid black curve ) , characterized by a power - law slope @xmath67 0.9 at the high - mass end , i.e. @xmath68 @xmath62 , and @xmath67 1.5 at the faint end where @xmath2 falls below the characteristic mass .",
    "these results are consistent with the models presented in @xcite where the @xmath69 relation is calibrated at @xmath3 6 and a @xmath70 relation is derived with @xmath67 1.3 - 1.6 at the low - mass end .",
    "this steepening of the sfr-@xmath2 relation towards lower masses may be due to the increased importance of feedback mechanisms in the star formation activity , such as supernovae and stellar winds @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the overall flattening of @xmath71 at these redshifts compared to the local universe , where sfr @xmath72 is mainly a consequence of the steepening faint - end slope of the observed lf at these redshifts , where @xmath73 -1.5 @xcite .    the uncertainty in our model calibration of @xmath19 , represented by the shaded region in figure [ fig : sfrplot ] ,",
    "is derived by varying the @xmath3 4 - 8 sfr function parameters within their respective 1@xmath13 confidence regions and rederiving the average sfr-@xmath2 relation .",
    "as can be seen , the dashed curves defining the sfr-@xmath2 relation at each redshift fall well within the boundaries of the uncertainty in the average scaling law , with the exception of the @xmath3 4 relation at the high - mass end .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : sfrplot ] illustrates the accuracy with which the mean scaling law approximates sfr as a function of halo mass at different redshifts .",
    "overall , the @xmath19 relation provides a reasonable representation of the @xmath55 relations at all redshifts , with departures of less than 0.2 dex within the halo mass range of interest . with the exception of the @xmath3 4 relation ,",
    "the @xmath55 are all very similar ( within 0.5 dex ) at @xmath74 10@xmath75 m@xmath66 . at the low - mass end ,",
    "the @xmath3 5 - 6 and @xmath3 7 - 8 scaling laws are over- and under - estimated respectively by less than a factor of two , while the sfr at @xmath3 4 is overestimated over the full halo - mass range by approximately the same factor .",
    "we therefore expect the mean relation to yield accurate estimates of the sfr function at these redshifts and , assuming that the sfr-@xmath2 relationship continues to remain roughly unchanged for @xmath36 8 , at higher redshifts as well .",
    "+      applying @xmath19 , we derive the expected sfr functions at redshifts @xmath15 4 assuming only evolution of the underlying dark - matter halo mass function .",
    "the results of our lf model are shown in figure [ fig : sfrf1 ] , both for the case where an intrinsic scatter of @xmath76 0.5 dex is assumed ( solid colored curves ) and in the limiting case where the variance is set to zero ( dashed curves ) . plotted alongside these results",
    "are the dust - corrected data points and the schechter lfs with the observed best - fit parameters reported in table 1 ( gray curves ) .",
    "we find that including an intrinsic scatter increases the number density and yields sfr functions that are more consistent with observation , particularly at the luminous end where the increase in @xmath58 due to scatter is most apparent .",
    "this boost in number density with the introduction of scatter can be attributed to the shape of the halo mass function .",
    "even though @xmath71 is log - normally distributed around the mean , @xmath19 , and the sfr scatter can thus go in either direction , the net change in the lf will always be dominated by low - mass halos entering into the galaxy sample by scattering into a sfr higher than its mean value , leading to a larger estimate of @xmath58 .    with the exception of @xmath3 4 , our predicted sfr functions accurately reproduce the observed ones and provide very good fits to the data points at the luminous end when intrinsic scatter is accounted for . at @xmath77",
    "our model predicts a sfrf which lies significantly above the observed data points by factors of 2 - 10@xmath64 .",
    "this is likely due to a combination of two effects : ( _ i _ ) as also argued by @xcite , the bright end of the _ observed _ @xmath77 sfrf is likely underestimated due to heavily obscured galaxies , which are missed in uv - selected lyman break galaxy samples ; and ( _ ii _ ) quiescent galaxies start to appear in the universe at @xmath77 in significant numbers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since our model does not include any prescription to quench star formation in galaxies , this is likely another reason why the model appears to be inadequate at @xmath77 .",
    "we conclude that our model should only be used at @xmath36 4 , where it provides a very good representation of the observed sfrfs .",

    "can also be calculated as a function of redshift , @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the speed of light , @xmath139 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath140 is the hubble parameter . this optical depth can be inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background , and for a while , the accepted value from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 9-year dataset was @xmath136 = 0.088@xmath105 0.014 , which , in the simplest model , corresponds to instantaneous reionization at @xmath141 10.5@xmath1051.1 . in early 2015 , a significantly lower value of @xmath136 = 0.066@xmath1050.016 was reported @xcite , consistent with instantaneous reionization occurring at @xmath141 8.8@xmath142 .",
    "more recently , the value has again shifted up to @xmath136 = 0.078@xmath1050.019 , consistent with instantaneous reionization occurring at @xmath141 9.9@xmath143 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : reion ] shows the expected reionization history of the universe ( left panel ) and the corresponding optical depth ( right panel ) computed using the cosmic sfrd @xmath99 we derived  from our model uv lfs .",
    "we find that the currently observed galaxy population at magnitudes brighter than @xmath144 -17.7 ( @xmath145 0.7 m@xmath66/yr , blue curve ) fully reionize the universe by redshift @xmath3 6 and that the model corresponding to this magnitude limit predicts a thomson optical depth of @xmath12 0.048 .",
    "integrating further down to @xmath144 -5.7 ( @xmath145 10@xmath97 m@xmath66/yr , red curve ) produces a model that reionizes the universe slightly earlier , at @xmath3 6.5 , with a predicted optical depth of @xmath12 0.054 .",
    "the shaded regions corresponding to each of these curves represent the 68% confidence limits arising solely from the uncertainties in the normalization of the cosmic sfrd .",
    "our results for the reionization history are consistent with measurements from high - redshift quasar and gamma - ray burst spectra , as well as from lyman alpha emission in high-@xmath17 galaxies which collectively indicate that reionization ended near @xmath146 6 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the model which includes the population of low - mass halos with sfrs as faint as 10@xmath97 m@xmath66/yr produces an optical depth that is consistent with the previous inferred value by planck , @xmath136 = 0.066 @xcite , at the 1@xmath13 level .",
    "these findings , in line with previous analyses , indicate that a significant population of low - mass star - forming galaxies is necessary for cosmic reionization and strengthen the conclusion that the bulk of photons responsible for reionizing the early universe emerged from ultra - faint galaxies .    in order for our model to reproduce the most recent value of @xmath136 = 0.078 inferred from cmb observations by planck , the average @xmath4 relation used would have to allow for larger star formation rates at the low - mass end .",
    "one simple way to satisfy such conditions is to permit @xmath19 to vary according to the average relation derived via abundance matching for @xmath68 10@xmath65 m@xmath66 , but decline as a power law for @xmath147 10@xmath65 m@xmath66 with a slope of @xmath67 1.3 , shallower than the slope derived empirically in  3.1 at the low mass end .",
    "in such a model , the corresponding optical depth would be @xmath148 0.076 , similar to the latest reduced measurement of @xmath136 = 0.078 . while the high - redshift lf functions derived assuming such a form for the average @xmath4 relation are in tension with current observations , future measurements taken with jwst will shed more light on how the lf functions evolve at these low sfrs .",
    "we also note that the results for @xmath118 and @xmath149 depend on the choices for the escape fraction @xmath124 , the number of ionizing photons per unit stellar mass @xmath123 , and the clumping factor @xmath132 ; if one assumes a smaller clumping factor , or a higher value for @xmath124 or @xmath123 , the evolution of @xmath118 will be shifted towards higher redshifts and an optical depth closer to the one measured by @xcite will be obtained .",
    "furthermore , the ionizing photons of population iii stars are expected to additionally increase the optical depth at high redshift @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we use the most recent @xmath3 4 - 8 uv lfs and uv continuum slope measurements to derive an empirical prediction of the evolution of uv lfs at @xmath36 8 . assuming a monotonic , one - to - one correspondence between the observed galaxy sfrs and the host halo masses , we map the shape of the observed @xmath3 4 - 8 uv lfs to that of the halo mass function at the respective redshifts . we find that the resulting @xmath4 scaling law remains roughly constant over this redshift range and is fairly well fit by a double power law , @xmath150 , with @xmath67 0.9 at the high - mass end , i.e. @xmath68 2@xmath6410@xmath65 m@xmath66 , and @xmath67 1.5 at the low - mass end .",
    "we note that the unevolving nature of this relation with redshift is an empirical result , an explanation for which lies beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "future work based on semi - analytic models and numerical simulations , as well as anticipated observations with atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , are expected to shed further light on this matter .    applying this average @xmath4 relation with an intrinsic scatter of @xmath76 0.5",
    ", we accurately reproduce the observed sfr functions at 5 @xmath5 10 ( figure 3 and 4 ) and extend our approach to predict the evolution of the uv lf at redshifts @xmath3 11 - 20 .",
    "we find an evolving characteristic number density @xmath87 which decreases as @xmath88 -0.3 , a gradually steepening faint - end slope , @xmath89 , and a shifting of the characteristic luminosity towards fainter values , @xmath90 0.4 . given the comoving volume and magnitude range of an ultra - deep jwst survey , our model predicts that observations of the lf up to @xmath3 15 are within reach in the absence of gravitational lensing , while deeper and wider surveys would be necessary to observe higher redshift objects .",
    "we also derive the evolution of the sfr density by integrating the sfrfs down to various sfr limits , ranging from 0.7 m@xmath66/yr ( corresponding to the faintest object observed in hudf12/xdf ) , to 10@xmath97 m@xmath66/yr ( corresponding to the minimum halo mass necessary to cool and form stars ) .",
    "the inclusion of galaxies with sfrs well below the current detection limit results in a more moderately declining cosmic sfrd with redshift and leads to a fully reionized universe by @xmath3 6.5 .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding predicted optical depth in this model , @xmath12 0.054 , is consistent with the reduced value of @xmath136 = 0.066@xmath1050.016 inferred from cmb observations by planck at the 1@xmath13 level .",
    "these results strengthen the claim that a significant portion of the reionizing photons in the early universe were emitted by a population of low - mass , star - forming galaxies that have thus far evaded detection .",
