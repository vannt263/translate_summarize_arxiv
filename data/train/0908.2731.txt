    "many tasks of solar and solar - terrestrial physics urgently require precise , quantitative information about the distribution of magnetic fields across the solar disk .",
    "however , the extremely complicated spatial structure of magnetohydrodynamic parameters in the solar atmosphere leads to differences in magnetic field data from different spectral lines .",
    "this is the reason why comprehensive analyses of magnetic - field measurements made in different spectral lines are important for diagnostics of solar magnetism and for the analysis of different data sets . in the first case , it is better to use observations performed at the same instrument , to avoid possible influences of different instrumental , method , time - dependent , and other effects . in the second case ,",
    "the aim is to construct composite long - term data sets combining different observatories to study , for example , the temporal variations of solar magnetic parameters on different time scales .",
    "a very significant part of solar magnetic - field observations has been performed ( and are performed up to now ) in the spectral line fei  525.0 nm .",
    "therefore , comparisons of observations in other spectral lines with observations in this particular line are extremely important . the atomic parameters of fei  525.0 nm ( large land factor , @xmath7 = 3 , small lower level excitation potential , @xmath8 = 0.12 ev ) stimulated vigorous discussions about the reliability of measurements in this line , which are not finished yet",
    ". different authors ( some aspects of this issue are given in the discussion in and in the recent paper of ) offer different correction factors to reduce raw measurements in fei  525.0 nm to the `` true '' ones .",
    "because of its low temperature sensitivity , one of the lines used as a `` standard '' for such correction is the rather strong line fei  523.3 nm with @xmath9 and @xmath8 = 2.93 ev (;",
    "; ; ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "however , the combination of this line and fei  525.0 nm is far from being perfect for diagnostics of solar magnetic fields , because they have different thermal dependencies , and fei  523.3 nm is not intrinsically narrow ( see ) . with much more success , it could be used as an example for the thermal line ratio . as shown by",
    ", reliable information about the magnetic - field parameters in the quiet regions ( which cover most of the solar surface ) can be achieved only using a combination of several lines with particular characteristics",
    ".    nevertheless , observations in the discussed lines are still important in the context of the cross - calibration of different data sets , especially for the data recalibration problem of the _ michelson doppler imager _ ( mdi ) onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) , see _ http://soi.stanford.edu/magnetic _ and solar news ( issues no .",
    "19 , 2007 and no .",
    "25 , 2008 ) . the soho / mdi observations of magnetic fields are performed in the spectral line nii  676.8 nm with @xmath10 .",
    "the main reasons for two subsequent serious revisions of the magnetic field data from mdi , which are widely used in the scientific community , are based on the comparison of observations in fei  523.3 nm and fei   525.0 nm made at the mount wilson observatory ( mwo ) and published by and . according to the first paper , based on the results of and , observations in fei",
    "525.0 nm must be multiplied by the factor @xmath11 or , according to the second paper , by the factor @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the center - to - limb angle . as a consequence , to fit soho / mdi data to mwo observations in fei  525.0 nm corrected in this way , they must be multiplied by a factor that is a function of @xmath13 , see figure 6 and table 3 of and whose mean value over the disk is 1.7 .",
    "according to , the factor is 1/0.619 = 1.615 for @xmath14 .    the fact , that the new mwo results strongly contradict the previous ones of , who found that the center - to - limb variation ( clv ) of the coefficient is @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , requires independent measurements . for disk center ,",
    "the factor is only 1.8 instead of 4.12 according to .",
    "their factor between @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be up to 5.5 ( see their figure 3 ) , which can hardly be explained by `` the fact that the shifted zeeman components at @xmath19 nm are shifted beyond the sampling passband of the mwo babcock magnetograph '' ( ) .    the above mentioned circumstances",
    "make an additional exploration of solar magnetic field observations in fei  523.3 nm and fei  525.0 nm an urgent task . the entire spectral - line profile should be considered .",
    "this is the main aim of our study .",
    "all previous observations concerning the relationship between magnetic - field data in fei  523.3 nm and fei  525.0 nm were obtained with photoelectrical magnetographs .",
    "drawbacks of such data are evident , because direct information about the distribution across the spectral line profile of the stokes parameters ( stokes @xmath20 in the case of longitudinal field ) is missing  the only reliable indicator of magnetic field in the spatial range of line formation .",
    "some assumptions and calibrations are necessary to obtain magnetic - field strengths from intensity variations in the exit slits of the magnetograph , which might be different for different spectral lines in the case of simultaneous observations .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations , as used in the present study , are much more reliable and informative . to study the problem of the comparison of solar magnetic - field measurements in combination of these lines , several series of observations in different regimes have been performed with the stokes - meter of the _ solar telescope for operative predictions _ ( stop ) at the sayan solar observatory ( sso ) .",
    "basic information about this instrument and methodical issues can be found in and .",
    "stop is equipped with a linear , 29 mm wide toshiba tcd ccd detector with 3424 pixels ( height 200 @xmath3 m , width 8 @xmath3 m ) , which allows us to obtain high - precision measurements of the stokes parameters @xmath21 and @xmath20 in several spectral lines simultaneously .",
    "the solar surface is scanned following a 2d - raster , and the spatial resolution depends on defocussing the solar image .",
    "the standard angular resolution used in the regular observing programs ( magnetograms of the large - scale magnetic fields , lsmf ) is @xmath22 and the scanning step is @xmath23 . to cover both lines with a single exposure , we used the fourth order of the spectrograph , where more than 2.7 nm are available .",
    "part of the observations obtained with this dispersion was done with the standard spatial resolution ( figures 7 and 8) , but most with focused solar image and standard scanning step , what corresponds to a resolution of @xmath24 .",
    "the cycle time ( one phase of the electro - optical modulator  @xmath25 crystal in our case ) was 30ms , the signal integration time in every point of the scanning process across the sun was four seconds with and four seconds without the half - wave plate .",
    "the @xmath26 plate is periodically inserted into the light beam in front of the coelostat to monitor the zero - level position .",
    "an example of stokes @xmath21 and stokes @xmath20 profiles across the whole ccd detector is shown in figure [ f - i - v - all ] .",
    "the data correspond to the point next to the solar disk center , observed on 3 february , 2009 with a resolution of about @xmath27 .",
    "it is easy to see how much information is provided by such observations .    to derive quantitative information about magnetic and thermodynamic parameters from stokes profiles such as those shown in figure",
    "[ f - i - v - all ] is a complicated task .",
    "we use the approach ( see ) , which numerically imitates the work of solar magnetographs in the center - of - gravity mode ( see ) , to obtain the magnetic flux density ( in the following we will use the term `` magnetic field strength '' for it throughout the paper ) from the recorded data .",
    "the code calculates the position of the spectral line in two states ( @xmath28/4 ) of the polarization analyzer .",
    "parameters for the `` exit slits '' are selected corresponding to the different lines .",
    "this position corresponds to the middle between the `` slits '' , where the intensities are equal .",
    "if @xmath29 is the wavelength of the spectral line in one analyser state and @xmath30 in the other one , the value @xmath31/2 is considered as the zeeman shift associated with the magnetic - field strength @xmath32 by the known equation @xmath33 , where @xmath32 is in gauss and @xmath34 in cm . for the case shown in figure [ f - i - v - all ] , the magnetic strength calculated this way is 26 g for fei  525.0 nm and 64 g for fei 523.3 nm .",
    "parameters for the `` exit slits '' are : the width @xmath35 is equal to 9.32 pm , the separation @xmath36 ( distance between line center and the `` slits '' centers ) is equal to 6.21 pm for the first line and @xmath37 pm , @xmath38 pm for the second line .",
    "the data used for figure [ f - i - v - all ] offer the possibility to estimate the errors of our measurements . to do this the noise level of the stokes @xmath20 signal in the continuum can be used . the best choice for it is the part of the spectrum on the right of fei  524.4 nm .",
    "calculations made for the @xmath39 150pm wide band show that the rms value in this region is @xmath40 . taking into account that @xmath410.01 corresponds to @xmath39 26 g for fei  525.0 nm and @xmath39 64 g for fei 523.3 nm , we conclude that the formal error of the measurements is @xmath39 0.3 g for the first line and @xmath39 0.8 g for the second .    figure [ f - i - v - u - m ] shows the stokes @xmath21 and stokes @xmath20 profiles for this pair of lines from the same observations as in figure [ f - i - v - all ] . figure [ f - v - u - m ] compares the stokes @xmath20 profiles of both lines . despite of the large difference in the @xmath7-factors , the amplitudes of the stokes @xmath20-profiles",
    "are almost the same and the peak positions of the stokes @xmath20 profiles are close to the steepest parts of the corresponding stokes @xmath21 profiles . as a consequence of the fact that fei  523.3 nm is deeper and wider than fei  525.0 nm , the separation of the stokes @xmath20 extrema for the first line is almost two times larger than for the second one , although the splitting factor of the latter is larger .",
    "therefore , in the case of weak fields , the separation of the stokes @xmath20 profiles peaks can not be a measure of the magnetic field strength when lines with different widths are used . indeed ,",
    "if the magnetic - field strength is far from the zeeman saturation regime , the locations of the stokes @xmath20 profile peaks are insensitive to the field and determined from the derivative of the stokes @xmath21 profile .",
    "already figure [ f - v - u - m ] allows for the disk center a preliminary estimate of the ratio @xmath0 . in agreement with , we prefer the notation @xmath6 for the ratio or the regression coefficient .",
    "the ratio of the stokes @xmath20 amplitudes ( average of the amplitudes of the blue and red stokes @xmath20 peaks ) of the two lines is @xmath42 .",
    "normalizing to the corresponding land factors , we obtain @xmath43 .",
    "this value is rather close to the estimation @xmath44 , obtained from calculations of the magnetic - field strengths using wide parts of the line wings .",
    "one point is not enough for a reliable estimation of the @xmath45 ratio .",
    "the scatter plot , calculated for three full - disk magnetograms observed on 1 , 2 , and 3 february , 2009 , is shown in figure [ f - scatterplot - u - m ] .",
    "parameters for the `` exit slits '' are the same as mentioned above .",
    "we see a rather high correlation coefficient @xmath46 , and a systematic difference with regression coefficient @xmath47 . to calculate @xmath6 , the reduced major axis method ( )",
    "is used . a formula to estimate the error ( which is determined from the scattering of the points , and which is less when the correlation coefficient is higher ) is taken from this book too .",
    "according to our measurements , the average factor that should be used to adjust measurements in fei  525.0 nm to those in fei  523.3 nm , is @xmath48 .",
    "the next logical step is to check for possible spatial variations of the ratio @xmath0 across the solar disk . for this purpose",
    ", we divide the solar disk into polar and equatorial sectors as in .",
    "we derive a polynomial fit @xmath49 , shown in figure [ f - clv - r ] .",
    "there are no significant differences in the clv of @xmath6 between polar and equatorial sectors of the disk . at disk center",
    ", @xmath6 is 2.74 , and closer to the limb , at @xmath3 = 0.3 , @xmath6 is 1.32 .",
    "the dashed line is a quadratic polynomial fit through the observed points .",
    "a significant decrease of the ratio @xmath45 with increasing heliocentric distance is illustrated in figure [ f - v - u - m - south ] , where @xmath20 profiles of the analyzed lines are shown for the point next to the south pole with @xmath50 and with magnetic field strengths @xmath51 g and @xmath52 g .",
    "the ratio of these strengths , @xmath53 , is rather close to @xmath54 from the analytical formula in figure [ f - clv - r ] at @xmath50 .",
    "as mentioned above , observations in fei  523.3 nm and fei  525.0 nm with the stop traditional spatial resolution of @xmath22 were performed besides the observations with the rather high spatial resolution in order to look for a possible dependence of @xmath0 on the spatial resolution .",
    "found a significant increase of @xmath6 with decreasing spatial resolution : @xmath6 = 4.5 at disk center at a resolution of @xmath55 instead of @xmath56 at a resolution of @xmath57 .",
    "examples of full - disk magnetograms with a resolution of @xmath22 , obtained on 1 february , 2009 are shown in figure [ f-2magnetograms ] . despite of the very weak magnetic field strengths everywhere across the disk ( minimum of solar activity",
    ", there were no sunspots and active regions ) , both maps show identical spatial structures , and they are well correlated .",
    "this is proved by the regression and correlation analysis presented in figure [ f - scat - u - m-100arcsec ] .",
    "calculations of the clv of @xmath0 for these data yield : @xmath58 .",
    "we see that @xmath6 is 2.83 at disk center , slightly more than the value of @xmath4 obtained with high - spatial resolution . despite the decrease of the resolution by a factor of ten , we encounter only a small @xmath59 increase of @xmath6 .",
    "the difference is much larger for large heliocentric distances , but most probably it is caused by a weakening of the field strengths and by an increasing influence of the noise .",
    "the cornerstone of the study by is the difference of magnetic field strengths measured in the different parts of the profile of fei  523.3 nm , _ i.e. _ the sampling of the line .",
    "they wrote : `` contrary to the assumptions of , and we find that the field indicated by @xmath345233 depends on the spectral sampling '' and that `` we [ ... ] recommend the use of a sampling point as close to the line core as is practical '' . in the work of ,",
    "the parameters of the spectral configurations with fiber - optic image reformattors were : centered on fei  525.0 nm ",
    "separation @xmath603.9pm ; centered on fei  523.3 nm :  @xmath614.5pm",
    ".    in the recent work , obtained new mwo observations with the same sampling for fei  525.0 nm and with a new set of separations of @xmath62and @xmath63 for fei   523.3 nm .",
    "computations of magnetic fields from various spectral sampling pairs and at @xmath64 have shown different values of correlations coefficients @xmath65 and slopes in the corresponding scatter plots , depending on the value of the separation and the range of @xmath13 ( see figures 1 to 3 and table i in ) .",
    "the correlation coefficients for measurements at @xmath64 with the other ones were : @xmath66 at @xmath67 , @xmath68 at @xmath69 , @xmath68 at @xmath70 and @xmath66 at @xmath71 .",
    "only the correlation coefficients for the pairs nearest to @xmath72 are reliable . in two other cases they are too small for a solid statistical analysis",
    ". the examples of slopes obtained by for the central area of the disk ( range of @xmath73 from 0.0 to 0.4 ) are : 1.665@xmath74 at @xmath67 , 1.795@xmath75 at @xmath69 , 1.162@xmath76 at @xmath70 and 2.694@xmath77 at @xmath71 .    the fact that magnetic fields measured in points near the line center ( @xmath69 ) are weaker ( by a factor of 0.73 after application of additional assumptions and calculations , see figure 12 of ) than those measured in a point near the middle of the line wings ( @xmath72 ) is the basic argument for the decrease of the correction coefficient @xmath6 , following from direct comparison of data sets in fei  523.3 nm ( sampling @xmath72 ) and fei  525.0 nm . for the disk center , the value @xmath78 is obtained instead of 5.5 .",
    "we are convinced that only the stokes @xmath20 profile over the whole spectral line can characterize the magnetic field properties in the range of the line formation .",
    "but for the comparison with mwo results , it is important to find relationships between strengths in the different parts of fei  523.3 nm in our data . for this purpose ,",
    "calculations with different `` exit slit '' parameters , close to those recently used at mwo , were performed .",
    "the results for 3 february , 2009 with @xmath27 spatial resolution are given in the following .",
    "the values of `` slit '' widths and separations are expressed in the integer numbers of ccd pixels . in observations ,",
    "the width of one pixel is equal to 0.777pm .",

    "the comparison of data with these `` slit '' parameters with other ones are given in table  [ t - so ] .",
    "for the points at @xmath79pm , our result differs from that of . according to our data ,",
    "magnetic fields measured closer to the line center are almost the same ( only 1.07 times weaker ) as measured at @xmath80pm .",
    "that means , if we correct measurements at @xmath81 taking into account the regression coefficient @xmath82 , we get a small difference to measurements in fei  525.0 nm . indeed , found @xmath83 for the disk center . applying a special correction factor",
    ", they obtained the value of 4.12 . in our case",
    "we find @xmath84 .",
    "all results described above have a direct impact on the problem of the calibration of soho / mdi magnetic - field data .",
    "some correction coefficients suggested by mwo scientists were already mentioned before .",
    "the correction factors for the mdi data are much less if we use the values derived from our observations instead of those obtained by and by . for disk center",
    ", we obtain 1.61 /(4.15/2.74 ) = 1.06 instead of 1.61 according to .",
    "our independent estimations of the soho / mdi correction factors are obtained using our previous results from the comparison of soho / mdi data with sso observations ( important : both analyzed data sets correspond to spatial resolution @xmath22 ) , published by . from figure 1(e ) of that paper",
    "we get an average value of 2.75 for the b(soho / mdi)/b(sso ) ratio . in order to correct the soho / mdi data (",
    "when they coincide with the corrected data in fei   525.0 nm ) , we have to multiply them with the coefficient 1.97/2.75 = 0.72 , if we take @xmath85 from our data with @xmath27 spatial resolution , and 2.55/2.75 = 0.93 , if we take @xmath86 from data ( see figure [ f - scat - u - m-100arcsec ] ) with @xmath22 spatial resolution .",
    "our correction coefficient is smaller by a factor of about two compared to the recent mwo results ( , ) , and instead of increasing the magnetic field strengths from soho / mdi data we have to decrease them .",
    "we would like to note here , that , according to the study of , observations at mount wilson and sayan observatories made in fei  525.0 nm are in almost perfect agreement with each other",
    ". therefore , the problem lies in the differences between the observations in the strong line fei  523.3 nm .",
    "it seems that this result contradicts to the result of , who obtained a correction factor of 1.56 , based on a comparison of soho / mdi and _ advanced stokes polarimeter _ ( asp ) data . but",
    "observations with the asp were made in a different spectral line ( fei  630.25 nm ) , and using different lines can lead to quite different results ( see and ) .",
    "further , analyzed only observations made in active regions , instead of full - disk quiet - sun observations in our case .",
    "besides that , the observations with asp and soho / mdi were made with much higher spatial resolution .",
    "in connection with this issue it is important to note that comparisons of soho / mdi with kitt peak spectro - polarimeter data ( , ) caused a decrease of the soho / mdi measurements by a factor of @xmath87 to adjust them to the kitt peak data .",
