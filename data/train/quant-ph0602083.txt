    "quantum entanglement is a feature of quantum mechanics that has captured much recent interest due to its essential role in quantum information processing @xcite . it may be characterized and manipulated independently of its physical realization , and it obeys a set of conservation laws ;",
    "as such , it is regarded and treated much like a physical resource .",
    "it proves useful in making quantitative predictions to quantify entanglement.when one has complete information about a bipartite system ",
    "subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1the state of the system is pure and there exists a well established measure of entanglement  the _ entropy of entanglement _ , evaluated as the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix , @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "this measure is unity for the bell states and is conserved under local operations and classical communication .",
    "unfortunately , however , quantum systems in nature interact with their environment ; states of practical concern are therefore mixed , in which case the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear .",
    "given an ensemble of pure states , @xmath4 with probabilities @xmath5 , a natural generalization of @xmath6 is its weighted average @xmath7 .",
    "a difficulty arises , though , when one considers that a given density operator may be decomposed in infinitely many ways , leading to infinitely many values for this average entanglement .",
    "the density operator for an equal mixture of bell states @xmath8 , for example , is identical to that for a mixture of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , yet by the above measure the two decompositions have entanglement one and zero , respectively .",
    "various measures have been proposed to circumvent this problem , most of which evaluate a lower bound .",
    "one such measure , the _ entanglement of formation _ , @xmath11 @xcite , is defined as the minimal amount of entanglement required to form the density operator @xmath12 , while the _ entanglement of distillation _ , @xmath13 @xcite , is the guaranteed amount of entanglement that can be extracted from @xmath12 .",
    "these measures satisfy the requirements for a physical entanglement measure set out by horodecki _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "they give the value zero for @xmath14 , which might be thought somewhat counterintuitive , since this state can be viewed as representing a sequence of random `` choices '' between two bell states , both of which are maximally entangled .",
    "this is unavoidable , however , because assigning @xmath15 a non - zero value of entanglement would imply that entanglement can be generated by local operations .",
    "the problem is fundamental , steming from the inherent uncertainty surrounding a mixed state : the state provides an incomplete description of the physical system , and in view of the lack of knowledge a definitive measure of entanglement can not be given .",
    "an interacting system and environment inevitably become entangled .",
    "the problem of bipartite entanglement for an open system is therefore one of tripartite entanglement for the system and environment .",
    "complicating the situation , the state of the environment is complex and unknown .",
    "conventionally , the partial trace with respect to the environment is taken , yielding a mixed state for the bipartite system .",
    "if one wishes for a more complete characterization of the entanglement than provided by the above measures , somehow the inherent uncertainty of the mixed state description must be removed .    to this end , nha and carmichael @xcite recently introduced a measure of entanglement for open systems based upon quantum trajectory unravelings of the open system dynamics @xcite .",
    "central to their approach is a consideration of the way in which information about the system is read , by making measurements , from the environment .",
    "the evolution of the system conditioned on the measurement record is followed , and the entanglement measure is then contextual  dependent upon the kind of measurements made .",
    "suppose , for example , that at some time @xmath16 the system and environment are in the entangled state @xmath17 a partial trace with respect to @xmath18 yields a mixed state for @xmath19 .",
    "if , on the other hand , an observer makes a measurement on the environment with respect to the basis @xmath20 , obtaining the `` result '' @xmath21 , the reduced state of the system and environment is    @xmath22    with conditional system state @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the probability of the particular measurement result .",
    "thus , the system and environment are disentangled , so the system state is pure and its bipartite entanglement is defined by the von neumann entropy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : von - neumann ] ) .",
    "nha and carmichael @xcite apply this idea to the continuous measurement limit , where @xmath25 executes a conditional evolution over time .",
    "in this paper we follow the lead of nha and carmichael , also carvalho _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , not to compute their entanglement measure _ per se _ , but to examine the entanglement _ dynamics _ of a cascaded qubit system coupled through the oneway exchange of photons .",
    "the system considered has been shown to produce unconditional entangled states  generally a superposition of bell states  as the steady - state solution to a master equation @xcite .",
    "for a special choice of parameters ( resonance ) , a maximally entangled bell state is achieved @xmath26 except that the approach to the steady state takes place over an infinite amount of time .    here",
    "we analyze the conditional evolution of the qubit system to illuminate the dynamical creation of entanglement in the general case , and to explain , in particular , the infinitely slow approach to steady - state in the special case .",
    "we demonstrate that in the special case the conditional dynamics exhibit a distinct bimodality , where the approach to the bell state is only one of two possibilities for the asymptotic evolution : the second we call an _ entangled - state cycle _ , where the qubits execute a sustained stochastic switching between two bell states . though involving just two qubits and elementary quantum transitions , the situation is similar to that of a bimodal system in classical statistical physics in the limit of a vanishing transition rate between attractors .    the physical model of the cascaded qubit system",

    "in this section we briefly outline the physical model for the cascaded qubit system to be analyzed . a more detailed description , together with the techniques and assumptions used to derive the model master equation presented here , is available in @xcite .",
    "the system considered consists of two high - finesse optical cavities , each containing a single tightly - confined atom , the cavities arranged in a cascaded configuration with unidirectional coupling from cavity 1 to cavity 2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . for simplicity",

    "inefficiencies and losses in the coupling between the cavities are modeled by a real parameter @xmath29 , @xmath30 , with perfect coupling corresponding to @xmath31 .",
    "the atoms are assumed to have five relevant electronic levels , of which two ground states , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , represent an effective two - state system , or qubit .     and",
    "@xmath33 , to three excited states , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for each atom , the cavity field in combination with auxiliary laser fields ( incident from the side of the cavity ) drives two separate resonant raman transitions between states @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "an additional laser field coupled to the @xmath37 transition provides a tunable light shift of the energy of state @xmath32 .",
    "all fields are assumed far detuned from the atomic excited states , so these states may be adiabatically eliminated and atomic spontaneous emission ignored . under the further assumption that the cavity field decay rate is much larger than the transition rates between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the cavity fields may also be adiabatically eliminated to yield a master equation for the reduced two - atom density matrix  @xmath12 , @xmath38}+{\\left[\\hat r_2,\\rho\\hat r_1^\\dag\\right]}\\right)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the rates of @xmath43 and @xmath44 transitions , respectively .    by virtue of the cavity output ,",
    "the system is an open system and solutions to master equation ( [ eq : me ] ) generally describe mixed states . under appropriate conditions",
    ", however , the system evolves to a pure and entangled steady state .",
    "if the coupling between cavities is perfect ( @xmath31 ) and the parameters of the subsystems are the same ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) then the steady state is the pure state @xmath47 where we use the abbreviated notation @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "then when @xmath50 , which we shall refer to as the _ resonance _ condition , the steady state is a maximally - entangled bell state .",
    "this may seem to be ideal , but a problem arises when we consider the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath51 . specifically , the characteristic time for the system to reach steady state , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the eigenvalue of @xmath51 with smallest ( in magnitude ) non - zero real part , approaches infinity as the resonance condition is approached .",
    "this is shown by the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "thus the master equation itself , in particular its steady state , offers limited insight into the behavior of the system at resonance .",
    "we wish to learn more about this special case ; in particular , how does the entanglement develop dynamically .",
    "also , if additional information is factored into the description , by making measurements on the environment , can we better characterize the long term behavior , or possibly find perfect entanglement after a finite time ?",
    "we demonstrate that quantum trajectory theory can provide answers to these questions .     the relaxation time @xmath54 plotted as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "note the singularity at resonance , @xmath56.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "as with any open system , the first step in unraveling the master equation is to identify the points of coupling to the environment .",
    "the first is obvious  the output from cavity 2 . to measure this output ,",
    "let us assume the existence of an ideal photon detector in the path of the output from cavity 2 ; we call it _ detector 1_.    the second point of coupling to the environment is more subtle",
    ". our model does not assume the inter - cavity coupling to be perfect ; only a fraction @xmath29 of the output photon flux from cavity 1 makes it into cavity 2 .",
    "physically , this loss may be caused , for example , by non - ideal transmissivity of the faraday isolators or by absorption in the cavity mirrors .",
    "these imperfections cause photons to be scattered into the environment in some uncontrollable fashion .",
    "formally , though , this is equivalent to assuming that the apparatus is ideal , except that there exists a beamsplitter between the cavities , as drawn schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we therefore further assume the existence of a second photon detector to collect photons reflected by this beamsplitter ; we call it",
    "_ detector 2_.        we now proceed to develop the quantum trajectory formalism for the cascaded qubit system . in this approach the system is described by a pure state which is dependent on ( conditioned on ) the counting histories , or records , of detectors 1 and 2 .",
    "firstly , we rewrite the master equation in a form suitable for translation into the quantum trajectory language .",
    "we reexpress eq .",
    "( [ eq : me ] ) in the form @xmath57 with    @xmath58-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1,2 }",
    "\\left(\\hat c_i^{\\dag}\\hat c_i \\rho+\\rho\\hat c_i^{\\dag}\\hat c_i\\right),\\\\ \\mathcal{s}\\rho&=\\sum_{i=1,2}\\hat c_i \\rho\\hat c_i^{\\dag},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath59    then , within quantum trajectory theory , the evolution of the system is described by a pure state @xmath60 which evolves under the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian @xmath61 the continuous evolution interrupted at random times by quantum jumps , @xmath62 , where the jumps occur with probability @xmath63 in time interval @xmath64 .",
    "physically , the jump operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 account for the reduction of the state of the system , given a photon count is recorded by detector  1 or detector  2 , respectively .",
    "thus , within the quantum trajectory description of the coupled cavity system , we consider an experiment in which ideal detectors are employed , such that every scattered photon is detected and recorded . given the history of detector ` clicks ' , one has complete information about the system state , in the sense that that state is always pure ; hence , although the solution to the master equation is generally mixed , one is able to characterize the entanglement in an unambiguous ( conditional ) fashion @xcite .",
    "consider the special case where the coupling between the cavities is optimal ( @xmath31 ) . in this case",
    "there is only one output from the system , that from cavity 2 , recorded by detector 1 .",

    "cm    figure  [ fig : fig4 ] contrasts the solution to the master equation and a single quantum trajectory .",
    "the solution to the master equation exhibits a completely smooth evolution that tends asymptotically towards the steady state .",
    "the quantum trajectory , on the other hand , undergoes a sequence of switches between two extreme values of @xmath72 , which occur at each photon detection . provided the parameters",
    "are chosen away from resonance , the photon detections eventually stop and the trajectory settles into the steady state ( [ eq : ss ] ) , with @xmath73 ; the steady state is clearly a dark state . at resonance , however , the photon detections may continue indefinitely .",
    "physically , this seems plausible , since it simply implies that the atoms continue to switch between states @xmath32 and @xmath33 , scattering one photon with each transition . at resonance , apparently",

    "the oscillatory behavior featured in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] hints at a simple cyclic process .",
    "in fact , it is simple enough that we can understand why it occurs without resorting to numerics . in this section",
    "we formulate a graphical description of individual trajectories .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] demonstrates that the conditional expectation @xmath72 is conserved during the periods of evolution between quantum jumps .",
    "the positively and negatively correlated subspaces @xmath74 are coupled only through quantum jumps .",
    "noting that @xmath75 are each @xmath76-dimensional ( assuming real amplitudes without loss of generality ) , we manage to break up a @xmath77-dimensional space into two @xmath76-dimensional planes , linked to one another by the quantum jumps .",
    "we refer to this representation as the _ cascaded system phase space_. trajectories within it can be viewed as lines moving continuosly within either plane and jumping discontinuously between the planes .",
    "we use phase space portraits within @xmath78 and @xmath79 to characterize the behavior of the system , where for the sake of simplicity , and without loss of generality , we are assuming @xmath80 and @xmath81 to be real .",
    "we define @xmath82 and scale time by setting @xmath83 .",
    "the master equation then takes the form ( @xmath31 ) @xmath84 where @xmath85 the resonance condition is now @xmath86 .",
    "it is useful to convert to a matrix notation , such that a pure state @xmath60 of the system is represented by a @xmath77-vector , @xmath87 and system operators are written as @xmath88 matrices , e.g. , @xmath89 and @xmath90 the evolution of @xmath60under @xmath91 is written as a linear differential equation in four variables , @xmath92\\ !   { |\\phi\\rangle}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc } -2&0&0&2r\\\\ 0&-(1+r^2)&2r^2&0\\\\ 0&2&-(1+r^2)&0\\\\ 2r&0&0&-2r^2\\\\\\end{array}\\right ) \\label{eqn : basicde}\\!{|\\phi\\rangle}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as noted above , this evolution is constrained within either @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",

    "recall from quantum trajectory theory that the probability for a state not to jump prior to time @xmath16 is given by its norm @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fig10 ] .    which of the two cycles is chosen in a particular realization of the photon counting record is random , as is the time taken to settle into the cycle .",
    "effectively , the decision is the outcome of a competition between the periods of evolution between quantum jumps and the jumps themselves  specifically , those associated with photon counts at detector 1 . considering eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cycle1prime ] ) and ( [ eq : ratio ] ) , we see that every count at detector  1 results in an increased probability to find the system in one of the antisymmetric bell states . on the other hand , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cycle2prime ] ) and ( [ eq : ratio ] ) , the periods of evolution between counts have the reverse effect ",
    "they increase the probability for the system to be found in a symmetric bell state .",
    "the critical factor that decides which tendency wins is the number of photon counts occuring at detector  1 over a given ( substantial ) interval of time .",
    "if there are many , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](b ) , the entangled - state cycle between antisymmetric bell states wins out ; if there are few , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10](b ) , the cycle between symmetric bell states occurs .",
    "the same decision mechanism is observed in other examples @xcite .",
    "note that counts at detector 2 are not involved  not directly at least .",
    "they do figure indirectly as a mechanism reducing the average number of counts at detector 1 ; indeed , they are the ultimate source of the asymmetry reflected in the ratio @xmath187 .    as the system approaches a particular cycle the quantum trajectory evolution tends to reinforce the establishment of the cycle .",
    "close to the antisymmetric cycle , the evolution between jumps is dominantly governed by @xmath188 and is therefore relatively fast .",
    "this leads to frequent photon counts at detector 1 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](b ) ] .",
    "close to the symmetric cycle , the between - jump evolution is dominantly governed by @xmath189 , hence is relatively slow .",
    "photon counts at detector 1 become much less frequent [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10](b ) ] .    from the dramatic difference in count rates at detector  1 for the two cycles ,",
    "it is clear that one can determine which entanglement cycle the system evolves to for a particular realization .",
    "however , without knowledge of the record of photon counts at detector 2 , which by definition we do not have , one can not know where on the cycle the system is , i.e. , whether the state is in @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the ensemble average state of the system is mixed , described by one of the density operators @xmath190",
    "consider a thought experiment where the cascaded qubit system , set to resonance , evolves freely and its entire output is collected and stored inside a black box . at some time the lasers driving the raman transitions are turned off , so the evolution ceases .",
    "the box and qubits are separated and moved to causally disconnected regions of space time .",
    "let alice and bob be standard observers of the qubits , and give eve jurisdiction over the box .",
    "we can now ask , how much entanglement exists between the qubits of alice and bob ? while this is simply a roundabout way of asking how entanglement evolves , it helps elucidate some of the key concepts behind the quantum trajectory measure of entanglement .",
    "conventional entanglement measures are based upon an analysis of the density matrix at this time .",
    "they throw away the box and look at the system of qubits alone  they disregard eve and view the system from the perspective of alice and bob .    yet in general",
    "every interaction between two objects entangles them , and as the qubit system and box interacted in the past , their states are intertwined . neither",
    "possess an independent reality , and neither , considered alone , can be completely described .",
    "eve s box contains information , which , if discarded , adds entropy to the qubit system of alice and bob .",
    "this entropy is the source of ambiguity in the quantification of entanglement . from this point of view , as noted in the introduction , the problem of bi - partite entanglement in an open system relates to that of tri - partite entanglement in a closed one . to completely characterize the entanglement of the present example , in addition to the entanglement between alice and bob",
    ", we must consider their entanglement with eve .",
    "a quantum description of the box is impractical , but it is feasible to extract classical information about what it contains , through measurement .",
    "quantum trajectories facilitate this , and allow us not to discard the box completely . in turn",
    ", the system state retains its purity , conditional on the classical information extracted from the box . with this extra information",
    ", we can extract more entanglement from the cascaded qubit system .",
    "working from the master equation for the cascaded system @xcite , previously it was assumed that the system evolved gradually into a pure state , whereby entanglement was generated .",
    "the behaviour at resonance , however , was unclear , since there the master equation had two zero eigenvalues and no well - defined steady state . by considering the conditional evolution we have shown that , at resonance , asymptotically the system is either in the bell state @xmath151 or oscillating ( stochastically switching ) between two bell states , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "from the density matrix point of view , the latter is an equal mixture of bell states and would yield no entanglement under any mixed state measure ; physically , alice and bob , without collaboration from eve , can not extract any entanglement from their qubits .",
    "suppose , however , that eve opens her box to count the number of photons inside .",
    "seeing whether the count is even or odd , she is able to deduce exactly which bell state alice and bob s system is in .",
    "thus , her measurement unravels the density operator , creating entanglement , despite the fact that the measurement is not causally connected to alice and bob s qubits .",
    "it is tempting to say that the entanglement was always there , as a matter of fact , until one realizes that there are many other ways in which eve could choose to measure her state , each producing a different unravelling of the qubit system and yielding a different value of entanglement .",
    "the entanglement facilitated by eve s measurements is _ contextual _ in this sense .",
    "this thought experiment demonstrates why any attempt to quantify the entanglement of an open system from the density operator alone can not be considered complete .",
    "the density operator should not be treated as a fundamental object , as it does not provide a complete description of the physical state .",
    "we have presented a simple example where oscillations between maximally entangled states are hidden within a separable density operator . the fact that the density operator contains entropy , implies that information about its entanglement with an external system was discarded at some time . in studying such a mixed state , there is benefit from considering , not only the mixed state itself , but the process through which it was generated , and the access this potentially gives to a conditional dynamics .",
    "the results of this paper could be extended by employing quantum trajectories in a broader sense . in cases where the results of environmental interactions can not be measured , such as coupling loss , wiseman and vaccaro @xcite",
    "have shown that only certain unravelings can be physically realized . a conceivable measure of entanglement would take the minimum of all physically realizable unravelings .",
    "alternatively , one might take the maximum of all physically realizable unravellings , which would measure the maximum distillable entanglement when local measurements on the environment are taken into account .",
