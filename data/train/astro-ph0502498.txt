    "black hole x - ray transients , a subset of the class of binaries known as x - ray novae or soft x - ray transients @xcite , are low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in which long periods of quiescence , often decades , are interupted by dramatic x - ray and optical / uv outbursts , frequently accompanied by radio emission which is sometimes associated with collimated outflows . the x - ray binary xte j1550 - 564 is an example of this class of objects . it was discovered in 1998 @xcite , at which time it underwent a period of major outburst , surging to perhaps its eddington luminosity assuming the distance and mass estimates of @xcite , 5.3 kpc and 9.4 @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "this initial event , which exhibited a variety of complex behavior including an irregular light curve , spectral state transitions , and quasi - periodic oscillations , lasted for @xmath1200 days ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "radio monitoring during the x - ray outburst recorded a radio flare , and subsequent vlbi radio observations soon thereafter showed evidence for a superluminal jet ejection event @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the jet has been detected in x - rays using _ chandra _ and has been shown to be decelerating @xcite . given these discoveries ,",
    "xte j1550 - 564 is a strong galactic black hole candidate and it has been classified as a microquasar .",
    "another major , although less luminous than the first , outburst occured about 1.5 years later . since mid-2000 , the source has remained active , exhibiting spoaradic , low - amplitude flaring episodes .",
    "it has been suggested that these occur at nominal 1-year intervals , but this pattern is not well quantified .",
    "a long - term light curve illustrating these basic features is presented in figure 1 .    early in 2003 , during a galactic plane monitoring scan , the international gamma - ray astrophysical laboratory ( _ integral _ ) , detected the onset of outburst activity in xte j1550 - 564 in the hard ( @xmath220 kev ) x - ray band @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a series of too observations were carried out .",
    "the source was also observed with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) , both with pointed observations as well as essentially continuous monitoring with the all - sky monitor ( asm ) . in this paper",
    "we present our analysis and interpretaion of these data .",
    "we briefly discuss the instruments onboard _ integral _ in  2 .",
    "our analysis of the _ integral _ and _ rxte _ observations is presented in  3 .",
    "this includes light curve analysis as well as our spectral model fitting and interpretation . in ",
    "4 we discuss the low - amplitude hard - spectral state outburst of xte j1550 - 564 in the context of models for x - ray nova outbursts , and spectral state transitions .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in  5 .",
    "_ integral _ was launched into a 3-day elliptical orbit on october 17 , 2002 .",
    "it carries four instruments , three of which have been used for our analyses : the imager ibis @xcite , the spectrometer spi @xcite , and the joint european x - ray monitor , jem - x @xcite . for a complete description of the _ integral _",
    "spacecraft and mission refer to @xcite .",
    "ibis is a coded mask instrument which has a wide field of view ( fov ) of 29@xmath3 @xmath4 29@xmath3 ( 9@xmath3 @xmath4 9@xmath3 fully coded ) with a point spread function ( psf ) of 12@xmath5 ( fwhm ) and is sensitive over the energy range 15 kev to 10 mev .",
    "there are two detector layers : isgri , an upper cdte layer with peak sensitivity between 15 and 200 kev , and picsit , a bottom csi layer , with a peak sensitivity above 200 kev . in this paper",
    "we have used only isgri data .",
    "the spectrometer on integral , spi , covers the 20 kev - 8 mev energy range with an energy dependent resolution of 2 - 8 kev ( fwhm ) .",
    "it consists of an array of 19 hexagonal high - purity germanium detectors .",
    "a hexagonal coded aperture mask located 1.7 m above the detection plane images large regions of the sky ( fully coded field of view 16@xmath3 ) with an angular resolution of @xmath12.5@xmath3 .    the joint european x - ray monitor telescope , jem - x , detection plane consists of two identical high - pressure imaging microstrip gas chambers .",
    "currently , only one telescope / detector is in operation at a time .",
    "each detector views the sky through a coded aperture mask . during the observations analyzed in this work ,",
    "only the jem - x 2 telescope was operational .",
    "we have analyzed the spi , ibis / isgri and jem - x data collected between january 29 , 2003 and april 12 , 2003 in a series of dither pointings or  science windows \" ( scws ) lasting about 30 - 40 minutes each .",
    "these include core program data from the galactic plane scans ( gps ) and the galactic center deep exposure ( gcde ) as well as data from a series of target of opportunity ( too ) observations activated as part of the general program ( see * ? ? ?",
    "data reduction was performed using the standard osa 4.1 analysis software package available from the _ integral _ science data centre .",
    "the data were downloaded from the heasarc mirror to the _ integral _ public data archive . only scws with a pointing direction within a specified angular radius were accepted .",
    "this radius varied for each instrument .",
    "we chose to use a 12@xmath3 radius for spi , a 10@xmath3 radius for ibis / isgri , and a 2@xmath3 radius for jem - x .",
    "these large angular cuts were only relevant for spi and isgri data prior to the outburst . during the too pointed observations the angular distance off - axis was never greater than @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to the _ integral _ data , we obtained the relevant _",
    "rxte_/asm data from the asm light curve archive .",
    "the long term x - ray light curve for xte j1550 - 564 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "rxte_/asm daily summations depicted there show the highly variable nature of this source . the major outbursts in 1998 - 1999 @xcite and 2000 @xcite are very prominent .",
    "the current outburst , indicated by the vertical dashed line , is quite modest in comparison .",
    "the january - april 2003 light curves for xte j1550 - 564 as seen by ibis / isgri and _ rxte_/asm are depicted in figure 2 . in panels",
    "2b - 2d we show the isgri light curves for the 15 - 40 kev , 40 - 100 kev , and 100 - 200 kev bands , respectively .",
    "each data point represents the average count rate for an individual scw , @xmath1 2000 seconds . in panel",
    "2a we show the _ rxte_/asm 1.5 - 12 kev light curve .",
    "each data point there is for a daily average .",
    "rxte_/asm light curve shows that this outburst began on or about march 21 , 2003 ( mjd 52719 ) and lasted for roughly 45 days .",
    "there is a broad peak lasting @xmath1 20 days with a peak count rate of 4.86 cts s@xmath7 or @xmath164 mcrab .",
    "the ibis / isgri light curve is less continuously sampled than the _",
    "rxte_/asm one .",
    "the outburst was first detected with isgri during _ integral _ revolution 54 on march 24 , 2003 during a gps observation .",
    "integral _ too was triggered and pointed observations commenced during revolution 55 on march 27 , 2003 and continued during revolutions 57 and 58 , and ended during revolution 60 on april 12 , 2003 . hence there is no isgri data during the initial rise phase nor any during the decay .",
    "the shapes of the light curves in the three isgri energy bands are very similar but there is a suggestion that the rise in the 100 - 200 kev band was slightly faster than the lower energy bands .",
    "the peak count rates in the 15 - 40 kev , 40 - 100 kev , and 100 - 200 kev energy bands are 37.6 cts s@xmath7 , 35.2 cts s@xmath7 , and 9.11 cts s@xmath7 , respectively . in figure 3",
    "we show the ibis / isgri mosaic image for revolution 57 which clearly shows xte j1550 - 564 during this time period .",
    "the major outbursts of 1998 - 1999 and 2000 showed transitions from a power law dominated low hard state to a high soft state that had a strong thermal component .",
    "we looked for similar transitions in the 2003 outburst by examining hardness ratios . using _",
    "rxte_/asm data , we calculated hardness ratios for the large september 1998 - january 1999 outburst as well as the march - april 2003 outburst . in this paper",
    "we define the hardness ratio when comparing two energy bands as ( h - s)/(h+s ) where h is the count rate in the higher energy band and s is the rate in the lower energy band . in figure 4",
    "we compare the hardness ratios for the two different outbursts using the 1.5 - 3 kev ( a ) and 5 - 12 kev ( c ) energy bands of the _ rxte_/asm .",
    "for the march - april 2003 outburst the hardness ratio is approximately constant with a value of @xmath10.3 .",
    "in contrast , the hardness ratio during the large september 1998-january 1999 burst varied significantly over its duration . during the initial flare",
    "the hardness ratio was similar to the 2003 burst with values near 0.3 .",
    "the hardness ratio quickly decreased to an almost constant value near -0.1 . during the second peak in january 1999 ,",
    "the hardness ratio was even smaller with values near -0.3 .",
    "this in agreement with @xcite who noted that the first peak of the outburst was generally dominated by power - law emission while the second peak was dominated by softer thermal disk emission .",
    "thus we find that not only is the march 2003 event of signifcantly lower peak luminosity , it is also appears to never leave the canonical low hard state .",
    "we will examine this further in the next section when we discuss our spectroscopy results .",
    "we performed spectral analysis of the jem - x , ibis / isgri , and spi data during the march - april 2003 outburst using osa 4.1 software . for jem - x and isgri , individual spectra",
    "are produced for each scw . for strong sources such as xte j1550 - 564 during this outburst , these individual scw spectra can be easily combined to improve there statistical significance and for direct comparison with spi spectra .",
    "we used the osa utility program _",
    "spe_pick _ to combine the jem - x spectra by revolution .",
    "the ibis / isgri spectra were similarly combined using the ftool _",
    "spi is a coded mask telescope like ibis and jem - x .",
    "but unlike these other instruments , it is not possible to extract spectra for individual spi pointings due to its relatively small number detectors and mask elements .",
    "thus for spi one can only extract spectra for a series of pointings . in this case",
    "we chose to extract one spectrum for each of revolutions 55 , 57 , and 60 using all the relevant scws in a given revolution .",
    "we then performed a simultaneous fit of the spi , ibis / isgri , and jem - x data , for each of the 3 revolutions , in xspec v.11.3.1 .",
    "we explored fits using the compst @xcite and comptt @xcite thermal comptonization models .",
    "we also explored the need for an additional spectral component due to reflection of the hard comptonized spectrum off of the relatively cool portion of the accretion disk using the pexrav model @xcite . during the fitting procedure",
    "the model normalization was allowed to vary from instrument to instrument and a systematic 5% error was added to the ibis / isgri data in order to achieve reasonable @xmath8 values ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the data being fit were restricted to energies greater than 3 kev , the hydrogen column density is not well constrained by the data .",
    "therefore in the fitting process we fixed the column density at @xmath9 .",
    "this value for @xmath10 was derived using the ftool nh which uses the results of @xcite and is fully consistent with the values derived by @xcite using _ chandra _ observations of the jets of xte j1550 - 564 .",
    "the pexrav model contains the system inclination angle as parameter .",
    "we set this parameter to @xmath11 as determined by @xcite .",
    "we found that the comptt model provided a significantly better fit to the data for each revolution than the compst with @xmath12 .",
    "the comptt tends to produce lower residuals above @xmath1100 kev . in terms of quality of fit",
    ", the results using the pexrav model fell in between the comptt , @xmath13 , and compst results .",
    "the complete results of our fitting procedures are given in tables 1 & 2 .",
    "given these results we can not make any determination about the need for a reflection component when fitting the spectrum of xte j1550 - 564 during this outburst .",
    "we also note that there is no compelling evidence for flourescent iron - line emission within the s",
    "/ n limits of our data .",
    "there is a significant yet consistent normalization difference between jemx , ibis / isgri and spi with ratios of approximately 0.9:1.0:1.6 .",
    "these cross calibration issues have been previously noted , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "@xcite have published results from the early rise phase of this outburst using _ integral _ core program and _ rxte_/pca data .",
    "we find that our best fit plasma temperatures and optical depths are similar to theirs while our 3 - 200 kev model flux for revolution 57 ( @xmath14 ergs @xmath15 s@xmath7 using the isgri normalization ) is roughly 2.4 times higher than theirs .",
    "this is expected since the vast majority of their data was from before mjd 52725 when the ibis / isgri count rate was a factor of 2 - 3 below the peak ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "we also note that the reflection scaling factors we obtain when fitting with the pexrav model are consistent with that found by @xcite , @xmath16 , although the errors in both instances are rather large ( see table 1 ) .",
    "there is also some evidence for spectral evolution to flatter power laws , lower cut - off energies , and a smaller reflection contribution with time but the errors on these parameters are significant .    in figures 5",
    "& 6 we show the spectral fits to the data from revolution 57 using the comptt model . in figure 7 we show the 90% confidence contours for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 comptt model parameters for each revolution .",
    "there is a strong suggestion of spectral evolution to lower @xmath17 and higher @xmath18 with time .",
    "no fe line structure is evident at the resolution and sensitiviy of jem - x .",
    "thus the spectra from each of the three revolutions are well fit by the comptt thermal comptonization model which produces essentially a cutoff power - law spectrum .",
    "we again find no indication of a transition from the low hard state to a disk dominated high soft or intermediate state as was seen in the major outbursts in 1998 - 1999 @xcite and 2000 @xcite .",
    "we also note the absense of any statistically significant excess relative to the model at the highest energies , as has been noted for other sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such excesses may have to do with the radial density profiles of the comptonizing plasma , and the inadequacy of the analytcal forms of the models to take such effects into account upwards of several hundred kev @xcite .",
    "alternatively , such excess continuum could be associated with an additional emission component resulting from bulk motion comptonization ( titarchuk 2004 , private communication ) .    finally , in addition to the static thermal comptonization models , we considered comptonization by an expanding plasma ambient to the central compact object .",
    "it was recently shown that the presence of such an outflow is likely to produce a net down - scattering of the emerging photon field  thus , a hardening of the spectrum in the @xmath19 kev region ( titarchuk & shrader 2004 ) .",
    "the observable effect is similar to what would be expected from various compton reflection scenarios .",
    "as noted however , there does not appear to be a statistically significant continuum residual at those energies in our static thermal comptonization model fits .",
    "since plasma ejection as evidenced from radio emission is believed to accompany the high - soft to low - hard state transition , one might conjecture that the hard - state turn on in these types of flares could also involve outflowing plamsa .",
    "we found that the model described by titarchuk & shrader ( 2004 ) led in some cases to a slightly improved fit ; for revolution 57 for example , we obtained 271/205 compared to 287.7/205 ) .",
    "we thus suggest that our results are consistent with scenarios involving plamsa ejection .",
    "however , the statistical improvement to the fit is marginal , thus , particularly in the absense of radio emission , we are reluctant to draw strong conclusions .",
    "@xcite showed that during the april 2000 outburst of xte j1550 - 564 there was spectral evolution from the low hard state to a softer intermediate state as the luminosity increases and then back to the low hard state as the source luminosity declines .",
    "the transitions from one state to another were rather abrupt and were described as a phase transition with hysteresis , i.e. the hard - to - soft transition occurs at at a higher flux than the soft - to - hard transition .",
    "this hysteresis effect has been previously noted , e.g. @xcite . the initial transition from the low hard state to the intermediate state",
    "was shown to occur when the integrated 2 - 200 kev flux reached @xmath20 ergs @xmath15 s@xmath7 .",
    "the transition from the intermediate state back to the low hard state for the 2000 outburst occurred a flux of @xmath21 ergs @xmath15 s@xmath7 . comparing the 2000 and 2003 outbursts ,",
    "the 2 - 200 kev integrated flux for the march 2003 outburst never exceeded @xmath22 ergs @xmath15 s@xmath7 , thus never reaching the flux where @xcite saw a transition to the intermediate state .    assuming a distance to xte j1550 - 564 of 5.3 kpc and a black hole mass of 9.4 @xmath0 @xcite , the corresponding 2 - 200 kev luminosities at which the hard - to - soft ( h - s ) and soft - to - hard ( s - h ) transitions occurred during the the 2000 outburst are @xmath23 ergs s@xmath7 @xmath24 and @xmath25 ergs s@xmath7 @xmath26 . during the 1998 - 1999 outburst ,",
    "the transition from the high soft state to the low hard state occurred at a luminosity @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "thus the luminosity at which the soft - to - hard transition occurs is consistent between the two major outbursts .",
    "they are also consistent with theoretical predictions of state transitions at luminosities near @xmath28 if one accounts for the hysteresis effect @xcite . for the 2003 outburst",
    ", we find that the 2 - 200 kev flux during revolution 57 was @xmath29 ergs @xmath15 s@xmath7 if we use the isgri normalization for the comptt model .",
    "this corresponds to a 2 - 200 kev luminosity of @xmath30 ergs s@xmath7 @xmath31 which is toward the lower bound of the theoretical range of luminosities where a transition could occur .",
    "thus the 2003 outburst of xte j1550 - 564 could be classified as a failed major burst in which the luminosity never reached the point of spectral transition .",
    "the fact that xte j1550 - 564 remained in it low - hard spectral state during the 2003 outburst ( and possibly in other minor outbursts over the last several years ) poses some interesting challenges to the disk - thermal - instability model for outbursts .",
    "this is the case both because of the relatively long binary period , 1.54 days @xcite with the implied large separation ( and accretion disk size ) , combined with the rather high frequency of the outbursts .    in one",
    "commonly accepted view of black hole x - ray transients , the low - mass companion star undergoes roche - lobe overflow , but at a sufficiently low rate that the gas is accumulated in the ( cool ) disk until a critical level is reached , at which point the outburst occurs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "just what this critical level of accumulated mass is unclear , but it is certain to depend on the size of the disk , and thus the binary separation .",
    "this behavior is analogous to the outburst cycles seen in dwarf novae , however the recurrence timescales for x - ray transients are generally longer and less regular . in between outbursts ,",
    "the accretion rate is low , and it is conjectured that an advection - dominated region fills the inner disk .",
    "the spectrum is hard ( photon indices @xmath32 ) and consistent with models of thermal comptonization .",
    "most often , in outburst the spectrum changes to a @xmath33 kev thermal spectrum , often interpreted as the radiation from a geometrically thin , optically thick disk , superposed on a softer power law ( photon indices @xmath34 ) extending to 10 s or 100 s of kev .",
    "such spectral state transitions are also well known in persistent x - ray binary sources .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that whether or not a spectral - state transition occurs depends on the value of @xmath35 . in the adaf model , the mass inflow rate must be sufficient to overcome the transition to the two - temperature ( electron - ion ) plasma , so that it can extend close to the innermost stable orbit @xcite .",
    "the details of this process may be crucial to a complete understanding of spectral - state transitions",
    ". it may be the case that for low @xmath35 regimes , sources remain in the low hard state .",
    "@xcite have suggested that short - period systems ( short in this context being @xmath365 hours or less ) , by virtue of their smaller binary separations and correspondingly smaller accretion disks , would naturally have outbursts of lower luminosity .",
    "additionally , the efficiency with which the adaf corona is produced may depend on the inner disk radius , and may be bounded by some maximum value .    historically , it is notable that a few of the transient lmxbs remain in the low hard state during outburst , e.g. gro j0422 + 32 , gro j1719 - 24 and xte j1118 + 480 ( e.g. brocksopp 2001 ) .",
    "but in two of these cases at least , the orbital periods are small , 4.1 hours for xte j1118 + 480 and 5.1 hours for gro j0422 + 32 @xcite .",
    "thus implying small accretion disks and accumulated reservoirs of matter . given xte j1550 - 564 s relatively long orbital period , the disk is large among lmxbs ; @xmath37 cm .",
    "thus the mass accumulated in the accretion disk between outbursts should be correspondingly large .",
    "how then are these small outbursts produced ?",
    "one possible explanation is that discrete accretion events can somehow occur in which only part of the inner disk is disrupted .    in view of the substantial differences between the major outbursts and the subsequent minor flaring events  in terms of the peak luminosities , the light curve shape and duration , as well as the hardness ratio and the recurrence frequency of similar events ",
    "one might speculate that some mechanism other than the thermal limit cycle could be occurring .",
    "for the spring 2003 event , we can estimate the total mass transfer based on our spectral analysis , and the a simplistic assumption that the spectral energy distribution remains nearly constant in shape , with the amplitude tracing the light curve envelope ( see figure 8) .",
    "this leads to a fluence of about @xmath38 ergs . for an efficiency of 10%",
    ", this corresponds to about @xmath39 solar masses of material transferred . from figure 1 ,",
    "its is evident that the events of this magnitude are ocurring on approximately annual time scales . the major outbursts of 1999 and 2000 execeed the 2003 event by several orders of magnitude in fluence and are more closely spaced .",
    "thus , the disk - thermal instability models must be able to reproduce a wide variety of phenomena .",
    "we suggest that there may be more than one mechanism functioning in xte j1550 - 56 . for example , a small , discrete accretion event , ie .",
    "a discontinuity in the mass transfer rate which would lead in a natural way to a  fast - rise , exponential decay \" ( fred ) light curve .",
    "persuing this hypothesis , we applied the diffusive - dissipation propagation model @xcite to the _",
    "rxte_/asm light curve data .",
    "this model predicts a fred - type light curve . the resulting model fit is shown in figure 8 where the inferred paramater of the fit , the diffusion timescale @xmath40 , was about 71 days .",
    "the diffusion timescale is defined as @xmath41 and is roughly two times the characteristic light - curve decay timescale . assuming the disk is about half of the roche radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and using the known orbital parameters , we estimate that the accretion disk outer radius is @xmath42 cm .",
    "this leads to a viscosity of @xmath43 @xmath44/s .    finally , we note one additional possibility .",
    "it was recently pointed out by @xcite , that xte j1550 - 564 is among a subset of transient bh x - ray binaries , known to have high inclination angles ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "each of these objects have exhibited irregular outburst light curves following there initial turn - on .",
    "the two early outburst peaks , with an intermittent valley of near - zero intensity seen in figure 1 are in that sense qualitatively similar to the outburst light curves of gro j1655 - 40 and xte j1118 + 48 for example . as @xcite note , sax j1819.3 - 2525 which has the highest known inclination ( @xmath46 ) underwent even more extreme erratic behavior , with separate outburst peaks spanning more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "this leads to the speculation that this irregular behavior may be a result of variable column densities along our line of sight , rather than to variations in the underlying outburst physics .",
    "for example , a flared outer disk of varying geometry , or with low - frequency precessional modulation could lead to such scenarios .",
    "it could perhaps then be the case that the hard , low - amplitude outbursts occur at times when the central x - ray source is highly obscured .",
    "what we are seeing in that case could be the compton - scattered emission from a spatially extended coronal region .",
    "however , the central thermal source in such scenarios would have to be obscured by columns of @xmath47 or else its presence would be revealed in the broad - band x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "we have examined the flux history and spectral characteristics of the march / april 2003 outburst of xte j1550 - 564 , with emphasis on its the high - energy observational coverage provided by _ integral_. our major conclusions can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) it was an underluminous event , with a fluence more then two orders of magnitude lower than the major outbursts of that source in 1999 and 2000 . there appear to be a number of such events in the long - term _ rxte_/asm light curve data , which ocurr with a frequency of 300 - 500 days . a recurrence rate of this scale , combined with the extreme range in peak luminosity , would seem to pose significant constraints on the standard thermal - disk instability model of x - ray nova outbursts .",
    "\\(ii ) the source apparently remained in the low - hard spectral state throughout the duration of the outburst .",
    "there was relatively little spectral evolution , although there is evidence for a moderate softening of the spectrum towards the end of our coverage .",
    "\\(iii ) the spectral energy distribution is well approximated by a thermal comptonization form .",
    "the inferred parameters , @xmath48 , @xmath49 kev , are similar to various other low - hard - state x - ray binaries .",
    "an alternative comptonization model , which involves scattering in a divergent outflow , was fit to the data . while not conclusive , results were of comparable statistical quality to those obtained for static comptonization models , consistent at least with the presence of outflowing plasma .",
    "also , it is known that plasma ejection leading to radio emission is known to occur at the onset of the low - hard spectral state of variable x - ray sources .",
    "\\(iv ) the spring 2003 event seems to be an outlier in the @xmath50 diagram of meyer - hofmeister ( 2004 ) characterizing x - ray nova outbursts .",
    "specifically , given its relatively long orbital period of 1.5 days , it is somewhat surprising for a low peak luminosity , @xmath12% @xmath51 , low - hard - state outburst to occur .",
    "\\(v ) given the complex outburst history of this source , as noted in item ( i ) , combined with the approximate fred profile of the spring 2003 outburst , we have conjectured on the possibility that multiple outburst mechanisms may be at play . in this context , we modeled the light curve profile as a discrete accretion event , undergoing diffusive propagation through the disk .",
    "this leads to a reasonable representation of the data , from which we find a @xmath52-day viscous timescale , and a relatively high mean viscosity .",
    "this work made use of the nasa high - energy astrophysics research archive center ( heasarc ) , and the nasa _ integral _ guest observer facility .",

    "<S> the well known black - hole x - ray binary transient xte j1550 - 564 underwent an outburst during the spring of 2003 which was substantially underluminous in comparison to previous periods of peak activity in that source . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our analysis shows that it apparently remained in the hard spectral state over the duration of that outburst . </S>",
    "<S> this is again in sharp contrast to major outbursts of that source in 1998/1999 during which it exhibited an irregular light curve , multiple state changes and collimated outflows . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to classify it as a  failed outburst . </S>",
    "<S> \" we present the results of our study of the spring 2003 event including light curves based on observations from both _ integral _ and _ rxte_. in addition , we studied the evolution of the high - energy 3 - 300 kev continuum spectrum using data obtained with three main instruments on _ integral_. these spectra are consistent with typical low - hard - state thermal comptonization emission . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the 2003 event in the context of a multi - source , multi - event period - peak luminosity diagram in which it is a clear outlyer . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the possibility that the 2003 event was due to a discrete accretion event rather than a limit - cycle instablility . in that context </S>",
    "<S> , we apply model fitting to derive the timescale for viscous propagation in the disk , and infer some physical characteristics . </S>"
