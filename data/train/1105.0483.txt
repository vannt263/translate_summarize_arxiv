    "the discovery of chiral symmetry on the lattice@xcite is considered as a new realization of symmetry which is incompatible with a given regularization used in a perturbative and/or non - perturbative approach to field theory .",
    "the crucial issue in this realization lies in an algebraic non - linear constraint on the dirac operators , the ginsparg - wilson ( gw ) relation@xcite .",
    "it makes possible to define symmetry transformations@xcite which are not simply specified by the standard @xmath1 matrix , but its non - trivial extension that depends on the dirac operator as well as the lattice spacing , avoiding the no - go theorem@xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that this formulation of chiral symmetry correctly gives the index theorem related to the chiral anomaly@xcite@xcite .",
    "the gw relation is essentially derived for free - field theories .",
    "gauge field can be easily included as an external field in the relation .",
    "it is non - trivial to discuss a generalized gw relation in the presence of interactions of fermions with other fields which undergo chiral transformations .    in this paper",
    "we discuss this issue in the context of the exact renormalization group ( erg)@xcite approach to continuum theory .",
    "the original gw relation was derived for a macroscopic action of the dirac fields on a coarse lattice obtained via the block - spin transformations from a microscopic action on a fine lattice . in parallel with this ,",
    "the wilson action in the erg defined at ir scale @xmath3 is obtained by blocking of an action given at a uv scale @xmath4 .",
    "we consider a symmetry assumed to be realized in the standard form at @xmath4 .",
    "it suffers from a deformation when our reference scale @xmath3 is going down from @xmath4 as we take a symmetry - breaking blocking .",
    "even though the symmetry can not remain in the standard form , it is realized in a non - trivial way . in general , the deformation of symmetry and its properties are described by the ward - takahashi ( wt ) identities for the wilson action , and by their extended version , the quantum master equation ( qme ) in the batalin - vilkovisky@xcite antifield formalism .    if we confine ourselves to those for the wilson action that is bilinear in the dirac fields , the wt identities for the fermionic sector lead to a relation which is quadratic in the dirac operator . for free - field theories",
    ", we have discussed that the wt identities lead to the standard gw relation for chiral symmetry and that for su(2 ) global symmetry@xcite .    in the presence of interactions between the dirac fields and some other fields , the quadratic relation in the dirac operator",
    "may be called as a generalized gw relation which contains the fields interacting with the dirac fields .",
    "this generally happens , not restricted to chiral symmetry .",
    "consideration of such a gw relation in chiral symmetry , therefore , may give some important insights into realization of other symmetries including that of gauge symmetry .",
    "we wish to discuss in this paper chiral symmetry in a linear @xmath0 model .",
    "we take symmetry - breaking blocking with a mass term for the dirac fields to discuss non - trivial realization .",
    "derivation of the wt identities for a generic linear symmetry has been discussed in ref .  , and also in ref .  .",
    "in the functional integral method we use , the wilson action for the ir fields is formally defined by an integration of the blocked uv action to construct the wt identities for the ir action .",
    "once we obtain the identities , we try to discuss the most general solutions to them in a purely algebraic way .",
    "the uv action is only used as a boundary condition for the solutions , and is not used to be integrated out .",
    "therefore , we are not confined ourselves to those solutions obtained from explicit integration of the uv fields .",
    "our main task is to solve the wt identities for the wilson action for the @xmath0 model which is assumed to be bilinear in the dirac fields .",
    "although this is a truncation in the fermionic sector , the wt identities we obtain are exact if we neglect a loop contribution arising from four - fermi interactions .",
    "the resulting identity for the dirac fields leads to a generalized gw relation for the dirac operator which has a non - linear dependence on the scalar fields .",
    "we obtain the most general non - perturbative solutions to the gw relation .",
    "they include as a special case the continuum counter part of the solutions obtained on the lattice in ref .  , where the scalar fields are introduced as auxiliary fields in the wilson action .",
    "there is also some other choice which corresponds to the solution obtained by explicit integration over the uv dirac fields .",
    "it corresponds to a perfect action if no blocking for the scalar fields is performed .",
    "it should be stressed that the chiral transformations for the dirac fields depend on the dirac operator , and become non - linear .",
    "they induce a jacobian factor that must be canceled with a counter action of the scalar fields .",
    "thus , the wilson action constructed from a solution to the gw relation contains the counter action which is not chiral invariant .",
    "chiral symmetry is not realized as invariance of the wilson action , and inclusion of the contribution from change in the functional measure is crucial in this realization .    on the lattice ,",
    "an operator extension of @xmath1 matrix denoted as @xmath5 is extensively used .",
    "it depends on the free dirac operator and the lattice spacing . in the erg approach to continuum theory considered in this paper ,",
    "there exists a field redefinition which reduces our family of the solutions to a family of the wilson actions for which the chiral transformation on the dirac fields is expressed in terms of @xmath5 .",
    "each wilson action consists of some composite object of the scalar fields which has a simple transformation properties . using new fermionic variables , chiral transformation is linearly realized , and symmetry is simply realized as invariance of the wilson action .",
    "we also show that appropriate field redefinition gives the dirac fields which obey the standard chiral transformation with @xmath1 .",
    "however , their yukawa interactions with the scalar fields inevitably become non - linear .",
    "such a field redefinition does not make sense on the lattice because of the singularity at the momentum region where the species doublers appear .",
    "we have two ways in realization of chiral symmetry , one with non - linear symmetry transformations , and another with linear transformations . even for the latter , the wilson actions which are solutions to the wt identities are non - linear in scalar fields .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly summarize a functional integral method for derivation of the wt identities for a global symmetry in the next section , and obtain a generalized gw relation for a @xmath0 model in section 3 .",
    "we give a family of non - perturbative solutions , and discuss some concrete solutions in section 4 .",
    "we then discuss that the family of the wilson actions constructed from the solutions given in section 4 can be reduced to a family of the wilson actions for which chiral symmetry is linearly realized .",

    "it is obvious that the dirac operator ( [ dirac4 ] ) provides the most general form of the solutions to ( [ gw - red1 ] ) .    on the other hand",

    "we conclude that the standard chiral symmetry is realized even when symmetry - breaking blocking is performed for the dirac fields .",
    "however , the their interactions with the scalar fields inevitably become non - linear .",
    "in this paper we have given the wt identities for chiral symmetry realized in the presence of a symmetry - breaking blocking for the dirac fields within the erg framework .",
    "the wt identities have been obtained using a functional method where the wilson action is expressed as functional integral over the blocked uv action .",
    "we have solved the wt identities as purely algebraic equations , assuming the wilson action is bilinear in the dirac fields .",
    "the assumption makes it possible to divide the wt identities into two sets of equations : one corresponds to a generalized gw relation for the fermionic sector .",
    "the other is to fix counter actions consisting of the scalar fields which are needed to cancel the contribution arising from the jacobian factor associated with the non - linear chiral transformation on the dirac fields . here ,",
    "chiral symmetry is realized in such a way that the change of the wilson action under non - linear symmetry transformations is canceled with the change of the functional measure in the wt identities .",
    "our family of solutions contains some special solutions : one is the continuum analog of the solution discussed in the lattice theory .",
    "the other one is a kind of perfect action obtained by integrating the blocked uv action over the dirac fields and identifying ir scalars with uv ones .",
    "in addition to the non - linear realization of symmetry , we have also discussed linear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "this is achieved by a field redefinition for the fermionic variables .",
    "the chiral transformations for new dirac fields are given with an operator extension of @xmath1 or even @xmath1 itself .",
    "accordingly , even if we have started with symmetry - breaking regularization , it is possible for us to end up with the standard representation of chiral symmetry .",
    "the whole complexity appears in the yukawa couplings where the dirac fields have non - polynomial interactions with scalar fields .",
    "the wt identities considered in this paper can be lifted to the quantum master equation ( qme ) in the batalin - vilkovisky antifield formalism@xcite .",
    "the reduction of the wt identities with the jacobian contributions to those without them corresponds to reduction of the qme to the classical master equation ( cme ) via a canonical transformation in the space of fields and antifields .",
    "it will be shown that the reduction of the qme to the cme happens in chiral symmetry considered here .    since our method given here",
    "is expected to apply to other linear symmetries such as supersymmetry and abelian gauge symmetry , it is interesting to discuss their generalized gw relations .    * acknowledgments *    we thank k. itoh and m. satoh for collaboration at early stage , and also one of the referees for suggesting us construction of most general solutions .",
