    "low - dimensional spin - gapped quantum systems are of current interest since they show interesting ground states and a variety of unconventional low - lying excitations . examples of such systems include spin-1 haldane chains @xcite , spin-@xmath2 even - leg ladders@xcite and spin-@xmath2 alternating chains @xcite .",
    "the discovery of appropriate compounds like y@xmath0banio@xmath1@xcite ( haldane chain ) , sr@xmath7cu@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite or srcu@xmath0o@xmath10 @xcite ( ladder systems ) has brought new insight into the study of these systems .",
    "there is a long list of various spin-@xmath2 alternating chain systems which are being intensively studied in connection to their magnetic excitations , to mention a few of them kcucl@xmath10 @xcite , tlcucl@xmath10 @xcite , cu(no@xmath10)@xmath0.@xmath11d@xmath0o @xcite .",

    "an important family of low - dimensional compounds are the layered vanadates av@xmath0o@xmath1 ( a = ca , mg , na , li , cs)@xcite . while cav@xmath0o@xmath1 and mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 contain only magnetic v@xmath13 ions and behave like spin-@xmath2 ladders with spin - gaps of the order of 600k @xcite and 20k @xcite respectively , @xmath3-nav@xmath0o@xmath1 , @xmath4-liv@xmath0o@xmath1 and csv@xmath0o@xmath1 are mixed - valence systems ( v@xmath14 on average ) with important charge and spin fluctuations .",
    "this last property makes this family specially interesting since it allows to study the influence of charge - ordering and the corresponding crystallographic distortions on the magnetic interactions .",
    "the quarter - filled ladder compound @xmath3-nav@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite is a highly discussed material and has become a model substance for the study of spin , charge and orbital coupling .",
    "it behaves like a spin-@xmath2 heisenberg system at high temperatures and at 34k undergoes a charge ordering ( 2v@xmath14 @xmath15 v@xmath13 + v@xmath16 ) transition@xcite accompanied with a lattice distortion @xcite and the opening of a spin gap@xcite .",
    "@xmath4-liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is a charge ordered system with no spin gap opening at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "recent investigations based on an _ ab initio _ analysis of the electronic structure@xcite show that charge fluctuations in this system are still significant and the experimental observations @xcite can be well described by a spin-@xmath2 asymmetric quarter - filled ladder model . such proposal has also found support by a numerical analysis of optical conductivity experiments@xcite .",
    "the third member of this vanadate family , csv@xmath0o@xmath1 , has been given much less attention .",
    "existing susceptibility measurements of isobe _",
    "et al._@xcite could be rather well explained by considering this material as a system of isolated dimers with a spin - gap of @xmath17 .",

    "s data and different values of the exchange integral @xmath18 and the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath19 are predicted .",
    "there are various reasons why we believe that this system deserves attention : ( i ) the question of how the electronic and magnetic properties of this material compare with the properties of the other two members of the alkali - vanadate family , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath3-nav@xmath5o@xmath20 and @xmath4-liv@xmath5o@xmath20 ( ii ) this system crystallizes in a similar monoclinic structure as the most discussed vopo and many other materials _ e.g. _",
    "kcucl@xmath10 , tlcucl@xmath10 showing an alternating chain behavior of the magnetic interactions .",
    "it is then worthwhile to find out whether csv@xmath0o@xmath1 has also a similar behavior of the magnetic interactions as its isostructural members .",
    "( iii ) as will be shown below , a re - examination of the susceptibility measurements reveals that a dimer model is not the only model that can provide reasonable fitting of the susceptibility data .    in view of the above",
    ", we have performed a microscopic study of this system by considering density - functional - theory - based ( dft ) calculations .",
    "the microscopic study of the electronic behavior of this compound reveals that the inter - dimer coupling in this material in addition to the intra - dimer interaction is also significant and should nt be neglected .",
    "further , an analysis of the susceptibility data shows that getting estimates of the coupling constants and the gyromagnetic factor based merely on a fitting procedure is very subtle and with such an analysis one can only test the consistency with the assumed model , but can not prove the uniqueness of that model .",
    "results on that will be presented in the next sections .",
    "we shall also discuss the similarities and differences to the other members of this vanadate family , @xmath3-nav@xmath5o@xmath20 and @xmath4-liv@xmath5o@xmath20 as well as to isostructural compounds like vopo .",
    "the crystal structure of csv@xmath0o@xmath1 is somewhat different from that of @xmath3-nav@xmath0o@xmath1 and @xmath4-liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . @xmath3-nav@xmath0o@xmath1 and @xmath4-liv@xmath0o@xmath1 crystallize in the orthorhombic space group @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) respectively .",
    "they consist of a double chain - structure of edge - sharing distorted square vo@xmath1 pyramids running along the orthorhombic @xmath25 axis , which are linked together via common corners to form layers .",
    "these layers are stacked upon each other along @xmath26 .",
    "na / li atoms are located between these layers .",
    "crystallizes@xcite , on the other hand , in the monoclinic space group @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "csv@xmath5o@xmath20 has also a layered structure with cs ions in between the layers .",
    "these layers , which are somewhat tilted ( _ i.e. _ not strictly in _ yz _ plane ) , and are stacked upon each other along @xmath29 , are made of two types of vanadium atoms v1 and v2 .",
    "the v1 atoms are in a distorted square pyramidal environment of oxygens and form pairs by sharing the edge of the pyramids .",
    "these pairs are separated from one another by the v2 vanadiums in a tetrahedral co - ordination of oxygens as shown in fig .",
    "[ struct_yz ] . within a pair of square pyramids ,",
    "the two apical o atoms are pointing in opposite directions and the remaining o atoms of the pyramids are shared with tetrahedra .",
    "the v1-v1 distance across the shared edge of the square - pyramids - pair is 3.073 @xmath30 and the v1-v2 distance across the shared corner of a pyramid and a tetrahedron is 3.352 @xmath30 .",
    "since the average v2-o distance within the tetrahedron d=1.718 @xmath30 is shorter than the average v1-o distance within the square pyramid d=1.882 @xmath30 , one can conclude from a bond - valence analysis @xcite that the v1 sites are in the oxidation v@xmath13 and the v2 sites are in the oxidation v@xmath16 .",
    "as the intra - pair v@xmath13-v@xmath13 distance is 3.073 @xmath30 while the inter - pair distance along the @xmath26-axis is 5.501 @xmath30 , this compound has been assumed to be a system of isolated dimers .",
    "in order to analyze the electronic behavior of csv@xmath0o@xmath1 , we carried out dft calculations within the local density approximation ( lda ) by employing the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave code wien97 @xcite ( lapw ) and by linear - muffin - tin orbital ( lmto)@xcite based on the stuttgart tblmto-47 code .",
    "both calculations agree well within the allowed error - bars of the various different approximations involved in two different methods . in both approaches we treated the exchange - correlation part by using the generalized gradient approximation @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ cs_spag ] the energy bands for csv@xmath0o@xmath1 along the path @xmath31 are shown .",
    "since the unit cell of csv@xmath0o@xmath1 contains four formula units , i.e. four v@xmath13 and four v@xmath16 , there are four bands around the fermi level which correspond to v@xmath13 - 3d orbitals .",
    "these bands are separated by an energy gap of about 2 ev from the lower o - p valence bands and an energy gap of about 0.5 ev from the upper conduction bands .",
    "the conduction bands up to 4ev are of v-3d nature .",
    "there are a few points to be noted here : ( i ) the energy range on the csv@xmath0o@xmath1 bands is of the same order of magnitude as it is in @xmath3-nav@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite and @xmath4-liv@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite .",
    "( ii ) the contribution of v@xmath16 - 3d is mostly in the upper conduction bands , starting from about 0.75 ev above the fermi level and have a very small contribution at the fermi level indicating that , contrary to @xmath3-nav@xmath0o@xmath1 and @xmath4-liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , here the system is close to complete charge ordering .",
    "( iii ) there is no dispersion along the @xmath29 axis while along the @xmath26 axis ( chain direction ) the dispersion is non - negligible and of about 300mev . along the @xmath25 axis",
    "the lda - bands show a small dispersion which corresponds to inter - chain interactions . in order to investigate the dimension - dependent behavior of csv@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ partial_dos](a ) the partial density of states ( dos ) of the v@xmath13 3d - orbitals for csv@xmath0o@xmath1 . for comparison",
    "we have also plotted in fig .",
    "[ partial_dos](b ) the partial density of states of v1 - 3d orbitals for @xmath4-liv@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite and in fig .",
    "[ partial_dos](c ) that of v-3d orbitals for @xmath3-nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "note that , while the @xmath4-liv@xmath0o@xmath1 and @xmath3-nav@xmath0o@xmath1 dos show the characteristic quasi-1d van hove singularities near the band edges around the fermi level , this is not the case for the cs - compound .",
    "the dos for csv@xmath0o@xmath1 shows more a 2d - behavior than 1d .",
    "( iv ) in the global frame of reference , the character of the bands around the fermi level turn out to be that of d@xmath32 with small admixture from d@xmath33 character . rotation to local co - ordinate system with the @xmath26-axis aligned along the _",
    "( v - apical o ) _",
    "direction for individual pyramids transform this to d@xmath34 character , in agreement with the crystal field analysis of a v@xmath13 ion in the pyramidal environment@xcite .",
    "the band - structure analysis leads us to the conclusion that inter - dimer coupling is non - negligible .",
    "if the system would have been a pure dimer system we would have expected no dispersion in any direction .",
    "the existence of a non - negligible dispersion tells us that a model of unlinked dimers is too simple and there must be some inter - dimer coupling to explain the band picture . from the dos analysis",
    "we learn that inter - dimer interactions in both @xmath26 and @xmath25 direction are important for the electronic properties .",
    "the possible role of the v@xmath16o@xmath35 tetrahedra in this context will be investigated in the next section .",
    "in order to understand the nature of the ground state in csv@xmath0o@xmath1 we need to determine the appropriate microscopic model which explains the low - energy physics of this compound . we have therefore applied the so - called _ downfolding method _ offered by the new and generalized version of the lmto @xcite method , together with a tight - binding ( tb ) analysis on the band - structure results .",
    "the downfolding technique consists of integrating out the high energy degrees of freedom so as to describe the details of lda energy bands close to the fermi energy in terms of few - orbital effective hamiltonians . from this analysis",
    ", we can extract the effective hopping matrix elements @xmath36 between vanadium ions in csv@xmath0o@xmath1 ( by fourier transform of the downfolded hamiltonian @xmath37 ) which reproduce the behavior of the lda bands close to the fermi level .",
    "since , as seen in the previous section , the contribution of the v@xmath16 - 3d orbitals around the fermi level is very small , and the biggest contribution comes from the v@xmath13 - 3@xmath38 orbital , a one - orbital effective tight - binding hamiltonian should give a good description of the low energy physics .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian therefore , can be written as :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote a pair of v@xmath13 ions labeled each one by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the unit cell and @xmath44 v@xmath13 ions in the unit cell . in fig .",
    "[ hoppings ] all the considered hoppings @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and t@xmath1 have been drawn .",
    "the subscript @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 indicate respectively that the hopping integral is between first nearest neighbors ( n.n . ) , second n.n .",
    ", third n.n and fifth n.n .",
    "the hopping term @xmath52 , which connects two v@xmath13 ions belonging to two different layers along @xmath29 , has been neglected due to its vanishingly small value .",
    "note here that no hopping terms have been considered along the @xmath29 direction , since as we have learnt from the band picture , there is no dispersion along this direction and that means that the interlayer coupling along @xmath29 must be negligible . in fig .",
    "[ tb_fit ] we show a comparison of the _ downfolding_-tb bands to the lda bands .",
    "we observe that not only the hopping corresponding to the intra - dimer interaction @xmath45 is important but also the inter - dimer matrix element @xmath47 along @xmath26 is considerable . a model with only @xmath45 and @xmath47 , i.e. alternating chain , shows a dispersion relation of the form : @xmath53 which is symmetric with respect to e=0 ( i.e. to @xmath54 ) and does nt account for the band - splittings in the paths @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these features are described by the inter - chain hopping parameters along the @xmath25 direction , @xmath46 and @xmath57 , though they are much smaller than @xmath45 and @xmath47 .",
    "note that the tb - results show an artificial band - crossing along the path @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we have analyzed this result and seen that the inclusion of longer - ranged interactions lifts this artificial crossing .",
    "concerning the nature of the hopping integrals , we observe that the values of the dominant hopping parameter @xmath60 ( which agrees with the overall band - width of the v@xmath13-d@xmath34 derived low - energy bands in csv@xmath0o@xmath1 ) is smaller than the dominant hopping parameter for @xmath3-nav@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite @xmath61 and @xmath4-liv@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite @xmath62 .",
    "this difference can be explained by the nature of the path .",
    "while @xmath45 in csv@xmath0o@xmath1 corresponds to a @xmath63 path in between two _ edge_-sharing square pyramids , @xmath64 in @xmath3-nav@xmath0o@xmath1 and @xmath4-liv@xmath0o@xmath1 corresponds to a @xmath63 path between two _ corner_-sharing square pyramids .",
    "this feature has important implications in the strength of the exchange interaction as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "also note that the same kind of _ edge_-sharing pyramids are also present in @xmath3-nav@xmath0o@xmath1 and @xmath4-liv@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite with effective hopping values smaller than @xmath64 and similar to @xmath45 in csv@xmath0o@xmath1 .    about the nature of the rest of the hopping integrals in csv@xmath0o@xmath1 , we observe that @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath57 correspond to v@xmath13-v@xmath13 paths through the bridging v@xmath16o@xmath35 tetrahedra with different lengths and angles .",
    "et al._@xcite studied , based on geometrical considerations , the various super - exchange paths for the case of vanadyl phosphates . in particular they considered the vopo compound .",
    "vopo and csv@xmath0o@xmath1 have a similar monoclinic structure if one identifies the p@xmath16o@xmath35 tetrahedra and the v@xmath13o@xmath1 square pyramids in vopo with the v@xmath16o@xmath35 tetrahedra and the v@xmath13o@xmath1 square pyramids in csv@xmath0o@xmath1 respectively . as argued by beltran _",
    "et al . _ , based on the formation of coherent molecular electron orbitals , the coupling between two v@xmath13 through bridging oxygens for separated pyramids is weaker than those via the pathways involving v@xmath16 ions . furthermore , double bridging modes , involving two v@xmath16 ions , as in @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( see fig .  [ hoppings ] ) can be stronger than single bridging modes involving one v@xmath16 ion as in @xmath57 .",
    "these interactions can be as strong as paths of the type @xmath45 , i.e. v@xmath13-o - v@xmath13 where the square pyramids are linked to each other by sharing an edge .",
    "geometry considerations then lead to a relative order of importance among the various bridging modes , which for csv@xmath0o@xmath1 is observed to be @xmath65 .",
    "we note here that while in csv@xmath0o@xmath1 we have seen that the dimers are formed by the edge - sharing pyramids ( @xmath45 ) with the predominant inter - dimer interaction formed by v@xmath13-v@xmath13 interaction bridged by v@xmath16o@xmath66 ( @xmath47 ) , in vopo these roles are interchanged in the sense that dimers are formed by v@xmath13o@xmath1 square pyramids bridged by p@xmath16o@xmath35 groups@xcite ( @xmath47 ) and the inter - dimer interaction is formed by neighboring v@xmath13o@xmath20 pyramids ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this is due to the different type of distortion in the square pyramids as well as different angle and distance relations between these two compounds .    using the relation @xmath67 , @xmath68 being the on - site coulomb electron - electron interaction and considering u@xmath69 2.8 ev @xcite",
    "the dft calculation gives an estimate of the intra - dimer exchange coupling , @xmath70 .",
    "to summarize , the conclusions that we draw from the above analysis is that _ ab initio _ calculations support an alternating chain behavior for csv@xmath0o@xmath1 along @xmath26 with weaker inter - chain interactions along @xmath25 .",
    "in order to test the results obtained from the _ ab initio _ calculation we only have available two sets of susceptibility data @xcite as a function of temperature which do nt completely agree quantitatively with each other .",
    "we consider here the data by isobe _",
    "et al._@xcite these authors proposed that their experimental data are well fitted by the susceptibility of a spin-@xmath2 dimer system with @xmath71 given by : @xmath72 with a g - factor of 1.8 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we have re - analyzed the data by considering the temperature dependence of the susceptibility for a spin-@xmath2 alternating heisenberg chain with : @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( antiferromagnetic couplings ) obtained by the stochastic quantum monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "we define the parameter @xmath78 which measures the ratio of the inter and intra - dimer coupling .",
    "@xmath79 corresponds to the dimer model .",
    "we introduce also an additional parameter @xmath80 so that @xmath81 , @xmath82 and therefore @xmath83 .    in fig .",

    "[ susceptibility ] ( b ) and ( c ) show the comparison of the experimental data to the spin-@xmath2 alternating heisenberg chain model for @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively .",
    "we observe that values of @xmath87 up to @xmath88 give still very good fits to the susceptibility data by choosing appropriate @xmath19 and @xmath18 parameters .",
    "this analysis makes plausible our _ ab initio _ results , namely the fact that the inter - dimer interactions can be also significant@xcite .",
    "the important conclusion that we gain from this susceptibility analysis is that it is a very hard task to determine the behavior of a compound only from susceptibility fits .",
    "extra information is needed so as to minimize the possible options .",
    "for instance , electron spin -resonance ( esr ) experiments could complement the susceptibility measurements by delivering the value of the gyromagnetic factor .",
    "there are in the literature other examples ( _ e.g. _ vopo ) where the only examination of the susceptibility led to a wrong interpretation of the behavior of the system@xcite .",

    "we observe that the behavior of this system can be best described by a spin-@xmath2 alternating chain model with weak interchain interactions .",
    "this proposal has been complemented by an analysis of available susceptibility data for this compound .",
    "a re - examination of the temperature dependence of the experimental susceptibility leads us to the conclusion that an alternating chain model can also provide a good fitting by choosing appropriate @xmath19 and @xmath18 values .",
