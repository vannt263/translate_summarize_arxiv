    "our method is applicable if the atom can be treated as an effective two - level system interacting with a narrow linewidth coherent laser field .",
    "it is shown that for a sufficiently low intensity pump and probe fields , the width of the recorded absorption line - profile is proportional to the homogeneous linewidth of the spectral line .",
