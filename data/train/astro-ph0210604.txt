    "weak gravitational lensing constrains fundamental parameters under the current paradigm that the power spectrum of matter evolves from primordial fluctuations due to gravitational instability .",
    "comparison of weak lensing power at @xmath13 with measurements of the cosmic background anisotropy at @xmath14 can ultimately test this underlying paradigm to high precision .    the coherent distortions induced by weak lensing are , however , lost in the intrinsic shape variations of the source galaxies unless a very large number of galaxy shapes can be determined to beat down this `` shape noise . ''",
    "this was the primary impetus behind the construction of the big throughput camera ( btc ; @xcite ) and other high - efficiency ccd mosaic cameras .",
    "we report here the results of a large weak - lensing survey conducted with the btc camera and its successor , the noao mosaic ii imager @xcite .",
    "firm detections of weak lensing in random fields were first reported using early data from mosaic ground - based cameras @xcite , hst @xcite , and single - ccd cameras @xcite .",

    "this is due in part to their relatively small number of galaxy samples ( @xmath15 or fewer ) .",
    "close inspection of these data also reveal , though , that the methods that were used to remove systematic distortions induced by psf ellipticities have left residual signals that may contaminate the lensing observations .",
    "more recently , @xcite[hyg02 ] , @xcite[vw02 ] , @xcite , and @xcite , have derived more precise constraints on @xmath16 and the normalization @xmath11 of the matter power spectrum by analyzing larger samples of galaxy shapes . in this paper",

    "hyg02 , vw02 , and this paper not only have large sky coverage , but also make use of the techniques presented by @xcite ; and @xcite for distinguishing `` e - mode '' distortion patterns , which should be produced by lensing , from `` b - mode '' power , which indicates the presence of uncorrected systematic errors .",

    "note that this stage of this procedure would be impossible if we had not dithered our exposures by large amounts , because a solution with only small shifts in galaxy positions leaves many of the distortion parameters degenerate , and there are too few usno stars to constrain all the higher - order distortion terms .",

    " 6.3 , we find a kernel for which @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are all 0 .",
    "the most important term for insuring that the psf does not bias the galaxy shapes is @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath80 and @xmath81 are higher order terms which can also cause a bias in galaxy shapes , so we make them vanish as well .",
    "the methods for finding the appropriate kernel are described in bj02  7 .",
    "+ once we have a kernel for each star in the image , we need to interpolate this kernel across the image .",
    "the kernel is described by a set of coefficients , so we actually fit each coefficient across the image .",
    "this apparently simple interpolation task has been found by us and other practitioners @xcite to require great care to avoid inducing spurious distortion power . with too little freedom ,",
    "an interpolant misses real variation in some regions of the chip , but with too much freedom , the fit adds spurious wiggles in other regions or at the chip edges .",
    "we find that simple polynomial fits could not simultaneously avoid both problems , especially on the btc psf structure .",
    "we instead use a smoothing spline algorithm developed by @xcite , which is available from netlib as rkpack . +",
    "as noted in bj02  7.5 , the convolution is efficient since each of the @xmath78 kernel components is the result of three successive @xmath83 kernel convolutions .",
    "+ we want to avoid extrapolating the kernel into regions where the psf is not well constrained .",
    "we hence reject all galaxies from our catalogs which are too far from any valid psf - template star or which are outside the bounding convex polygon of all such stars .",
    "we also reject regions which are near extremely bright stars to avoid spurious detections due to diffraction spikes , rings or bleeding columns .",
    "_ remeasurement of shapes _ [ stepellipto2 ] + the convolved images now have stars that are round .",

    "the measurement again uses the method of bj02  3 .",
    "+ note , however , that the shapes are not yet the true shapes of the galaxies .",
    "a round psf makes a galaxy appear more round than it really is .",
    "this is called psf dilution , since the magnitude of the ellipticity is reduced by the psf .",
    "appendix  c of bj02 derives an approximate factor @xmath21 by which the shape has been diluted .",
    "each galaxy shape must be corrected for dilution by the factor @xmath84 to obtain an estimate of the true shape of the galaxy .",

    " 8.2 describes the `` centroid bias . ''",
    "essentially , the centroids of galaxies are more uncertain in the direction of the psf elongation than they are perpendicular to this direction .",
    "this anisotropic error in the centroid position affects the measured shapes as well and leaves a bias in the shapes relative to the observed psf shape .",
    "+ the functional form of the bias is expected to be @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the significance of the galaxy detection ( see step  [ stepuber ] ) , and the @xmath87 are weighted second radial moments ( sizes ) of the psf and the galaxy .",
    "we measure @xmath88 empirically simply by fitting all of the observed shapes to this form , obtaining the value @xmath89 for both btc and mosaic images .",
    "the bias is then subtracted from the shape of each galaxy .",
    "_ combination of measurements _ [ stepuber ] + step  [ stepdistortion ] yields a list of multiply - detected galaxies and the exposures on which each galaxy was measured .",
    "we can now combine the set of shape measurements for each galaxy into a single maximum likelihood estimate of the shape according to the methods of bj  4.2 . + before averaging , we correct for the dilution mentioned above by dividing each shape by the dilution @xmath21 ( _ cf .",
    "_ step  [ stepellipto2 ] ) .",
    "galaxy measurements with @xmath90 are rejected . +",
    "this step is also where we select our galaxies using an unbiased estimate of the significance @xmath86 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite and in bj02  8.1 , a surface - brightness selection of galaxies ( as for sextractor ) is inherently biased toward galaxies aligned with the psf .",
    "galaxies which are the same shape as the psf are essentially matched - filtered by the psf , and thus are easier to detect .",
    "we estimate the significance of each galaxy according to @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the weighted flux of the object , @xmath93 is the white noise density of the sky , and @xmath94 is the scale size of the object . if these are all measured in the _ convolved _ images , which have round psf , then the estimate of @xmath86 has no shape bias .",
    "we have found empirically that sextractor detects essentially all objects with @xmath95 , so galaxies more significant than this are unaffected by selection bias .",
    "we therefore cut from the galaxy sample all galaxies with @xmath96 .",
    "we now have a catalog of galaxies for each field , with an estimate of the true shape of each galaxy before being affected by seeing or other psf effects .",
    "we also keep in this catalog an estimate of the errors in the ellipticity measurements , the magnitude , and the size of the galaxy .",
    "one may ask how our bj02-based methodology compares to the more common ksb methods .",
    "we have not tried to construct a parallel ksb pipeline for our data , so we can only speculate on the relative merits . from theoretical considerations ( see bj02 ) , we expect our methods to reduce the impact of photon noise on the measurements of individual ellipticies by 20% or so . for circular objects the 2 methods are equivalent .",
    "there is a similar potential s / n gain from the use of our nearly - optimal weighting when combining shapes to estimate a distortion (  [ determiningshear ] ) , since the shape noise is minimized .",
    "we expect a more significant benefit over ksb to be a reduction of systematic errors due to uncorrected psf ellipticities ( described in next section ) .",
    "ksb breaks down when objects are nt gaussian or the psf is nt nearly circular , and our higher - order circularization kernel is expected to do a better job with the @xmath97 psfs that are present in our data .",
    "the most daunting problem in weak - lensing measurements is not the volume of the data , but rather the elimination of spurious shape correlations caused by instrumental effects , particularly asymmetric psfs .",
    "our decision to make a shallow survey is beneficial in that the galaxies have known @xmath12 and larger angular sizes than faint galaxies , but a shallow survey has a smaller lensing signal and hence is more susceptible to systematic errors .",
    "our requirements for rejection of systematic signals are very stringent : as noted below , the lensing distortion signal at our largest scales is @xmath98 rms , while a large fraction of our images contain stellar images with ellipticities of 10% or higher .",
    "this is particularly a problem for the btc images , because significant astigmatism in the telescope combines with warped ccds to produce larger psf ellipticities than is typical .",
    "galaxies measured in image regions with stellar ellipticities @xmath99 are discarded from the catalogs .",
    "there are a number of checks one can make to look for systematic errors in the galaxy shapes .",
    "in particular , since the convolution should make the stars round , we check that the stars in the final image actually are round .",
    "also , it is expected that most systematic effects will correlate with the position on the chips and/or the size and shape of the psf .",
    "we describe here some of the tests we have done to quantify systematic errors which might remain after the processing steps described in ",
    "[ datareduction ] .",
    "we make a `` whisker plot '' of the stars in every image to look for images where the processing may have gone wrong . for example , missed stars near the corners of the chip , a bad fit to the kernel , _ etc .",
    "_  a representative example of one of these plots along with the corresponding plot before the convolution is given in figure  [ starwhiskerplots ] .",
    "for reference , the horizontal whisker in the center of each corresponds to 1% ellipticity .",
    "clearly , the convolution does not make each star exactly round .",
    "each whisker on the plot still has about 1 - 3% ellipticity .",
    "the important thing to check is that the convolution has removed any coherence in the whisker orientations .",
    "measurement error on the stars ellipticities will leave uncorrelated random whiskers as residuals .",
    "the longer whiskers tend to correspond to fainter , noiser stars .    to search for residuals which may be coherent functions of pixel coordinates , we average the shapes of the stars from many images as a function of position on the ccd array .",
    "the whisker plots resulting from this procedure for both the btc and mosaic chips are shown in figure  [ psfshapeplots ] .",
    "all of the whiskers are smaller than the 1% whisker , with most of the whiskers barely visible ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the only whiskers which approach 1% in size are in the corners of the chips .",
    "this is mostly due to the fact that stars near the corners are more likely to be rejected from the kernel fits ( in step  [ stepconvolve ] of  [ datareduction ] ) .",
    "therefore , fewer stars are being averaged , and the statistical errors tend to increase the resultant whisker size .",
    "this is not a problem for the galaxies , because galaxies in regions with no stars are also rejected .",
    "another way to see how well we are making the stars round is to plot the final shape of the stars against the initial shape .",
    "this plot is shown in figure  [ residpsfplot ] .",
    "there is a noticeably positive slope for both @xmath76 and @xmath77 , but the slope is of order 1/300 .",
    "this means that the shape of the psf is reduced by a factor of 300 by the convolution .",
    "the mean final ellipticity for the worst initial ellipticities is less than 0.1% , which is well below the level of our lensing signal .",
    "moreover , the rms deviation from zero is only 0.03% .",
    "we can make whisker plots for the galaxies as well as the stars .",
    "the galaxies , however , are not each expected to be round after convolving . even when the psf is round , the galaxies each have a real shape variance of order 30% . to see if the convolution has affected the galaxies correctly as well as the stars , we reduce the shape noise by averaging the shapes of many galaxies .",
    "we first bin the galaxies by array position to search for systematic errors that depend upon pixel coordinates .",
    "figure  [ galshapeplots ] shows the ( null ) results of this test . for neither hardware configuration",
    "do we detect any residual pattern in the galaxy shapes .      the biggest systematic effect to eliminate",
    "is the effect of the psf .",
    "while there are other effects which vary across the chip , such as charge transfer inefficiencies , telescope distortion , and the flat field pattern , clearly the main concern is the psf .",
    "the most obvious test then is to bin the allegedly - corrected galaxy shapes by the `` raw '' psf shape , as was done for the convolved stars .",
    "again , each individual galaxy is not expected to be round , but the average shape of many galaxies should be independent of the psf shapes for the galaxies if the survey is large enough to decouple the psf variations from the true lensing signal . figure  [ biasplot ] shows the results of this test .",
    "apparently , there is still a bias of the galaxy shapes with respect to the initial psf shape .",
    "the plot shows a slope of approximately 0.015 , which corresponds to a 0.4% effect for our worst psfs , and a 0.2% rms effect .",
    "this is somewhat below ( but of the same order as ) the level of our lensing signal .",
    "we believe the observed residual galaxy dependence upon psf shape is primarily due to higher - order asymmetries in the psf which have not been removed by the @xmath78 convolution filters .",
    "we plan to implement the full higher - order analytical psf corrections of bj02  6.3.5 and expect this to have smaller residuals than the kernel - convolution method used here .",
    "until then , we empirically fit for the slope of this bias and subtract the bias from the galaxy shape measurements .",
    "however , it is likely that simply subtracting the bias from the galaxy shapes is not the correct thing to do . in particular",
    "the bias seems to be stronger for faint galaxies and for large galaxies ( which may be due to slightly non - linear ccd response or charge transfer efficiency ) .",
    "we currently use different bias slopes for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , but it is possible that we have not correctly identified the exact population of galaxies which are giving us most of the bias .",
    "therefore , we suspect that this residual is likely the main source of the b - mode power described in  [ massap ] .",
    "once we have a catalog of galaxy shapes , we want to be able to convert these shapes into various statistics of the lensing distortion field .",
    "these statistics require finding either the average of many ellipticities ( _ e.g .  _",
    "the overall shear in each field ,  [ overallshear ] ) or the average product of pairs of ellipticities ( _ e.g .  _ the shear correlation functions ,  [ shearcorrelation ] ) .    the optimal weight for averaging ellipticities to obtain the lensing distortion [ bj02 equation ( 5 - 28 ) ] requires knowledge of the intrinsic distribution @xmath103 of galaxy shapes .",
    "the distribution for the brighter , well - measured galaxies in this survey is shown in bj02 figure  4 .",

    "bj02 figure  5 demonstrates that this weight recovers very close to the optimal signal to noise for the estimate of the distortion .",

    "@xcite perform a complete numerical simulation of the distortion measurement process , concluding that the overall calibration is accurate to @xmath112 .",
    "the bj02 formulae improve upon those of @xcite so we believe the responsivity calibration is now accurate to @xmath113 or better .      the simplest statistic to calculate",
    "is the average distortion in each of our 12 fields .",
    "these results are listed in table  [ fieldstable ] .",
    "the uncertainty on each of these measurements is typically @xmath114 .",
    "the @xmath17 for detection of each distortion component in each field is @xmath115 .",
    "collectively , they give a strong detection of the rms fluctuation in the shear field averaged on a scale of @xmath116 . at the @xmath117 redshift at which our sensitivity to lensing matter peaks ( _ cf .  _  [ zdist ] ) , this corresponds to a comoving smoothing scale of @xmath4  mpc , the largest scale to date on which gravitational lensing effects have been detected .",
    "figure  [ scatterplot ] shows a scatter plot of the 12 distortion values , along with their error bars for each component .",
    "the mean distortions appear randomly distributed as expected for a real signal . a tendency to align on the @xmath118 axis",
    "would indicate a systematic error aligned with the ccd axes , such as charge transfer nonlinearities  no such effect is seen .",
    "we assume that the average of each distortion component @xmath118 or @xmath119 in a 25 square box has a gaussian probability distribution with width @xmath94 .",
    "the expected distribution is then broadened by the measurement error in each field ( ) . a maximum likelihood analysis of the 24 values then yields @xmath120 .",
    "circles at 1@xmath94 and 2@xmath94 are also drawn on figure  [ scatterplot ] for reference .",
    "for comparison to other results which use the shear , @xmath121 , rather than the distortion , @xmath122 .",
    "@xcite introduced the shear correlation functions of the ellipticities of pairs of galaxies measured with respect to the line separating them .",
    "we will not make direct use of the correlation functions to constrain cosmology , but rather follow the prescriptions of @xcite ( as clarified in @xcite and @xcite ) for constructing the  and  statistics ( described below ) from the correlation function data .",
    "the simplest way to calculate these functions is to treat the lens distortion as a complex number , @xmath123 . to conform with other authors , we express the correlations in terms of the shear @xmath121 , related in the weak limit to the distortion by @xmath124 .",
    "three correlation function are defined by : @xmath125 note that if the galaxies in a pair are swapped , the first equation turns into its conjugate .",
    "thus , this quantity can be made manifestly real by double counting every pair of galaxies . with only single counting ,",
    "the imaginary term gives an estimate of the statistical error of the other three quantities .",
    "further , taking a mirror image of the entire field will turn the second equation into its conjugate .",
    "thus , the imaginary part of this quantity is also expected to go to zero in the absence of systematic effects .",
    "near - optimal estimators for these two - point functions are constructed using the weight function and responsivity defined in equations  ( [ dwts][dend ] ) : @xmath126 where the sum is taken over all pairs of galaxies @xmath127 and @xmath128 with separation @xmath129 within some bin .",
    "the variance of @xmath130 due to shape noise and shot noise is also simply estimated , but cosmic variance and bin covariances are more difficult to estimate .",
    "we bypass these complications by constructing field - to - field covariance matrices , as described below .",
    "as our primary use of the correlation functions will be to calculate other quantities by integrating over a range of @xmath131 , we calculate the correlation functions in fairly small bins with @xmath132 .",
    "the aperture mass statistic ( ) is useful for estimating cosmological parameters .",
    "the idea is fairly straightforward : a mass concentration at the center of a given aperture will tend to produce a tangential pattern to the galaxy ellipticities around the center of the aperture . for cosmic shear measurements ,",
    "we do not detect the mass concentrations individually [ see @xcite for a rare ( so far ) example ] , but rather the magnitude of the mass _ fluctuations _ , so we really want the rms variation of the  value as the aperture is swept across the sky .",
    "the  statistic for a single aperture of radius @xmath131 is @xcite @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the tangential component of the shear ( as estimated from the galaxy ellipticities ) .",
    "for many independent apertures , @xmath135 and the variance , , probes the power spectrum of the effective convergence .",
    "the window function for this statistic is narrow in @xmath136-space and centered at @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "one advantage of the  statistic is that there is a natural test for systematics .",
    "if each galaxy is rotated in place by 45 degrees , the  integral should vanish if due purely to lensing .",
    "this test is essentially measuring the curl of the shear field , and is therefore often called the `` b mode , '' while  measures `` e - mode '' power .",
    "we designate this b - mode version of the  statistic as .",
    "most systematics are expected to add equal power to the e and b modes , hence the  data are a sensitive test for contaminating systematics .",
    "another advantage to using the  statistic is that @xmath138 is very weakly correlated with @xmath139 when @xmath140 differs from @xmath141 by a factor of @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "thus , for our range of @xmath143 , we have essentially 7 independent points with which to constrain cosmology .",
    "the problem with calculating  in the obvious way ( scanning the aperture across the images and calculating variance ) is that each aperture is not uniformly filled with galaxies .",
    "there are holes due to foreground bright stars , edge effects , bad columns , _ etc .",
    "_  these holes can then bias the resulting  estimates and produce spurious power . specifying a mask for our entire survey would require a painfully long time , as would the development of software to automate the task .",

    "* ) express  and  as integrals over the shear correlation functions , which do not require knowledge of the survey geometry .",

    "the result of this calculation for our data are shown in figure  [ mapgammaplot ] and discussed in the following sections .",
    "another common statistic of the shear field is the windowed variance , @xmath147 , which is the variance of the shear when smoothed with a circular window of radius @xmath131 .",
    "we have presented in  [ overallshear ] the results for the windowed shear in 25 squares . for quantitative comparison to cosmological models",
    ", the naive @xmath147 summation would require knowledge of the survey mask geometry . again",
    "the above references show how to express @xmath147 as an integral over @xmath148 and @xmath149 , thereby removing the need to know the mask .",
    "if correlation function data are available out to separation @xmath150 , then all of ,  and  are unambiguously determined for @xmath151 .",
    "the  statistic is inferior to in several respects : its window function in @xmath136-space is much broader , and hence measurements at different @xmath131 are more highly correlated . also  does not separate e - mode from b - mode power , so the noise is @xmath18 higher and there is no systematic - power null test .",
    "the information in this statistic is mostly degenerate with the  statistic , with the important exception that the variance probes the power spectrum for @xmath152 , whereas  probes @xmath153 .",
    "therefore  for @xmath131 near half our 25 field size probes a portion of the power spectrum at larger physical scales than is accessible to .",
    "we will therefore make use of  for @xmath154 .",
    "the  statistic is plotted above the  statistic in figure  [ mapgammaplot ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite do give prescriptions for producing versions of the @xmath155 and  statistics which separate the e and b contributions .",
    "however , these expressions have indeterminate constants of integrations which render the e and b modes degenerate on the scale of the field of view .",
    "shear that is nearly constant over the field obviously can not be classified as having either e or b properties .",
    "since we only use  for values of @xmath131 near the field size , we will not use this decomposition .      for each of our twelve fields",
    ", we have a vector of observations , @xmath156 , including the  values from 1  to 100 , and the  values from 50  to 100 .",
    "each of these vectors has many data points , since we calculate each statistic at rather small intervals in aperture radius @xmath131 .",
    "however , these data are highly degenerate in their information content .",
    "values become essentially independent at a factor of 2 in @xmath131 , giving only about 7 independent data points . and",
    "values are highly correlated with each other , with the effect that these values only add one more independent data point .",
    "so the mean of the twelve vectors , @xmath157 , gives us essentially 8 independent points with which to constrain cosmology .    to quantify this degeneracy more exactly , we construct the full covariance matrix , @xmath158 , for the @xmath159 vectors by equally weighting each of the twelve fields : @xmath160                   [ ( { \\bf x}_n)_j - \\langle x_j \\rangle ]        } { n(n-1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 ranges over the @xmath159 fields , and @xmath161 are the indices of the data values .",
    "this construction of the covariance matrix means that we ignore the ( approximately identical ) nominal error bars for each point , using the actual field - to - field variation as our estimate of the error .",
    "this has the advantage that it automatically includes cosmic variance in the uncertainty as well as measurement noise both on and off the diagonal .",
    "the disadvantage is that the half - size fields , which have slightly larger statistical error bars , are given equal weight to the full - size fields .",
    "it is evident in figure  [ mapgammaplot ] that there is significant power in the  statistic , indicating that we do have some b - mode power , and hence some systematic contamination in our data .",
    "the effect becomes much weaker at scales @xmath162 , suggesting that the large scale data are probably free of this contamination .",
    "since the b - mode drops to essentially zero at the largest scales of , we also expect that the  statistic will be free of the contamination for @xmath154 , since it probes power at even larger angular scales .",
    "note that the observed b - mode signals are much larger than those to be expected from intrinsic galaxy - shape correlations @xcite or second - order gravitational lensing effects @xcite .",
    "we believe that they are more likely due to uncorrected high - order psf effects or inexact kernel fitting , both of which become more important at smaller scales .    most systematics effects , including uncorrected psf variation , can increase  and   much more easily than decrease .",
    "however , one can also conceive of systematic effects which simply mix power from the e - mode into b - mode rather than add power to either one . for example , if each ellipticity vector s orientation is rotated slightly but the magnitude is unchanged , then no power is added , but the power is mixed somewhat into the b - mode .    therefore , a conservative estimate is that the  values can be in error in _ either _ direction by the amount of the   values .",
    "further , it is not sufficient to simply increase the error bars on individual data points by this amount , since the effect is presumably in the same direction at all ( or many ) values of @xmath131 .",
    "instead , one should consider the two cases of adding the b - mode to all points and of subtracting it from all points .",
    "the range of these two cases will then give an estimate of the full potential effect of the systematic error .",
    "if the spurious systematic signal has more e power than b power , we could still have overestimated the lensing e signal .",
    "such behavior is expected only , however , for intrinsic correlations , which we believe to be a small constituent of our systematic contamination .    in any case , for the purpose of constraining cosmology , we want to limit our consideration to the range of @xmath131 that has the least amount of b - mode contamination .",
    "we will use the  values only for @xmath163 , and still use  from @xmath164 .",
    "thus , our data vectors @xmath165 ( _ cf .  _  [ covarmatrix ] ) now only have essentially 4 independent data points .",
    "the increase in the statistical error from this reduced @xmath131 range is however much more than compensated by the decrease in the systematic error from the b - mode ; in this range the systematic error is smaller than the statistical error .",

    "thus essentially all existing shear - correlation measurements in the literature probe the nonlinear regime .",
    "since our survey measurements extend to beyond 1 degree ( albeit at shallower depth ) , we span an interesting dynamic range that includes the nonlinear regime ( below 5 arcminutes ) , the quasilinear ( 10 - 20 arcminutes ) and the nearly linear regime on larger scales . in any case , to compare our full set of measurements to model predictions with some degree of accuracy requires that we use a well calibrated model for the nonlinear mass power spectrum .",
    "the fitting formulae developed by @xcite provide empirical but fairly accurate predictions for the nonlinear power spectrum .",
    "we will use the @xcite formulae to compute the shear variances for different models .",
    "recently vw02 have discussed the accuracy achieved with these formulae and found that on arcminute scales there is some uncertainty in the theoretical predictions which precludes parameter estimation at much better than the 10% percent level .",
    "the large angular scale coverage of our measurements makes this uncertainty on small scales less of an issue .",
    "the second issue in making model predictions is the choice of cosmological parameters to vary .",
    "one approach is to choose a physical model and vary parameters that have specific meaning within such a model .",
    "our approach however will be closer to an empirical one in which we will choose the parameters that lensing is most sensitive to and take other parameters to be unknown or fixed .",
    "based on earlier theoretical work @xcite , we choose the primary parameter space to be that of @xmath11 , such that the amplitude of the linear power spectrum is @xmath217 , and @xmath16 , the present mean mass density parameter of the universe .",
    "we will parameterize the shape of the power spectrum by the standard @xmath218 parameter , which has a specific physical meaning for cold dark matter models .",
    "we will fix @xmath10 and the primordial spectral index @xmath219 in most of the analysis , but as discussed below , we will explore the sensitivity of our constraints to the value of @xmath218 .",
    "we have above explored the sensitivity to the uncertainty in our redshift distribution .",
    "our analysis is similar in spirit to that of vw02 , but our choice of survey depth and angular scale makes the interpretation insensitive to unmeasured parameters of @xmath12 and @xmath218 , so marginalization over these quantities is not required .",
    "the theoretical predictions for  and  are given by the following equations : @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath222 are the first and fourth - order bessel functions , and @xmath223 is given by .",
    "in the linear regime , for an einstein - de sitter universe the 3-dimensional mass power spectrum grows in time as @xmath224 , so the dependence on the redshift coordinate @xmath187 is contained in the term in square brackets in .",
    "however for other cosmologies and in the nonlinear regime the growth rate is different , so the dependence on @xmath187 is more complicated and can be scale dependent .",
    "thus the dependence on cosmological parameters enters in rather complicated ways through the distance factors as well as the power spectrum . for a reasonable class of models that are at all consistent with other cosmological probes ,",
    "the dependence of the second moment of lensing statistics on the cosmological constant is weak .",
    "the main dependences then are on @xmath16 and @xmath11 , and as shown in previous work , the combination that enters is close to the one in cluster abundances and is given roughly by @xmath225 .",
    "there are further dependences on the shape of the power spectrum and the redshift distribution which we will explore below .      as described in  [ covarmatrix ] above , our data are essentially reduced to a mean vector , @xmath226 , of  and  values , along with the covariance matrix of these values , .",
    "we calculate the corresponding vector for each of our cosmological models and compute a @xmath227 value for each model : @xmath228    one important consideration in the above calculation is that our covariance matrix is largely degenerate .",
    "our vector has over 100 elements , since we calculate the statistics at fairly small separations in aperture radius .",
    "however , as discussed in  [ covarmatrix ] and  [ bmode ] , there are really only 34 independent data points among all of these .",
    "rather than selecting 4 values of @xmath131 arbitrarily , we use a singular value decomposition to calculate @xmath229 , and take only the largest 4 eigenvalues of the decomposition .",
    "this automatically uses only the non - degenerate components of the matrix , and in some sense finds the best combination of the data to use for our 4 values .",
    "the 4 values selected for table  [ datatable ] are therefore merely representative of the data used for the constraints .",
    "figure  [ contourplot ] shows a contour plot of @xmath227 as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath11 .",
    "the nominal overall best fit is at @xmath230 .",
    "however , there is clearly a strong degeneracy in this plot indicating that we really only constrain the combination @xmath231 , which is found to have a value of @xmath232 ( 95% confidence interval ) .",
    "this error bar includes only the statistical and cosmological variations which went into the calculation of the covariance matrix .",
    "however , we need to account for the systematic uncertainty due to the b - mode power . as discussed above in  [ bmode ] , we allow for the two possibilities : that the e - mode should be either increased or decreased by the amount of the b - mode . for these two extremes ( also plotted in figure  [ contourplot ] )",
    ", we find that @xmath231 ranges from 0.263 to 0.377 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "that is , these are the minimum and maximum values at 95% confidence for any of the three cases : e , e+b or e - b .",
    "these values then span the full range allowed by our data taking into account both the systematic and the statistical errors .",
    "our calibration and redshift uncertainties of  5% and  7% respectively are smaller than the above errors but need to be included .",
    "we also examined the dependence of our result on @xmath218 , and found that for the range [ 0.15,0.50 ] , our estimate of @xmath11 varied as @xmath233 , which even for the extremes of this range is only a 2% result , and is therefore negligible compared to our other uncertainties .",
    "we add all of these uncertainties in quadrature to get a final estimate of : @xmath234 which includes all systematic , statistical , and calibration uncertainties .",
    "models for the high and low extremes of this range along with the best fit model are the dotted curves plotted in figure  [ mapgammaplot ] .",
    "it is particularly unfortunate that we can not use the data at @xmath235 , since one of the expected benefits from our survey was the large dynamic range over which we are able to measure shear .",
    "we make a significant lensing detection from @xmath236 up to @xmath237 , over 2 decades of power - spectrum range . in the absence of contaminating power , our uncertainty in @xmath11 would be approximately half of our present error bar .",
    "the benefit of having a larger scale range is that it can break the degeneracy seen in figure  [ contourplot ] between @xmath11 and @xmath16 .",
    "larger values of @xmath16 tip the predicted curve up at small scales , whereas smaller values tip it down .",
    "so with the full range of data and no b - mode contamination , we would start to gain some constraint on @xmath16 .",
    "if we repeat the above calculation using the entire range of 1100  for the  statistic and the same 50100  for the  statistic , we find that the statistical error bars drop from about 17% to about 7% .",
    "however , the systematic errors dominate in this case , so that the final 95% cl estimate is @xmath238 . thus , while the statistical precision is nominally improved , the b - mode degrades the expected accuracy , and therefore we believe the above estimate ( ) is more appropriate .    given the obvious benefits to removing whatever is causing the b - mode contamination , we have spent considerable time trying to determine the cause and which steps have brought the b mode down to its current level .",
    "a detailed discussion is in @xcite , which we summarize here .",
    "one step which we believe is a source of spurious power is the fit of the kernel across the image (  [ datareduction ] , step  [ stepconvolve ] ) .",
    "we found the b - mode to drop somewhat when we switched from a polynomial fit to a smoothing spline .",
    "there are unfortunately only @xmath239 stars per image , which means that even without noise , a fit can only probe variations on scales larger than @xmath240 of the chip size ( @xmath241 ) . smoothing the psf fit to average measurement noise",
    "means that real variations in the psf on scales of several arcminutes will be missed .",
    "another source of spurious power could be higher - order asymmetries left in the psf after application of our circularization kernel .",
    "we currently use a @xmath78 kernel which removes the lowest 3 orders of the psf bias .",
    "stars in our fields do have significant power in higher orders .",
    "we tried to test this hypothesis by increasing our kernel size from @xmath242 to @xmath78 ( which we still use here ) , but the b - mode did not change significantly .",
    "non - linearities in the ccd response could produce spurious shear power , because we use relatively bright stars to measure the size and shape of the psf . if this were the case , however , the effect would likely be very different for the two cameras used in our observations .",
    "the measured e and b powers for btc , mosaic , and mixed fields are all consistent with each other , as illustrated in figure  [ mapeb ] .",
    "while we do not know which of the above effects is causing our b - mode , shortcomings in the psf - circularization kernel seem the most likely cause",
    ". we may be able to do better by implementing the analytic deconvolution technique described in bj02 .    to be complete",
    ", there is another possible cause of the b - mode contamination  intrinsic correlations of the galaxy ellipticities .",
    "@xcite calculate the correlation function that may exist due to spin correlations between galaxies .",
    "the predicted power , scaled to our median redshift of 0.5 , is not much lower than the b - mode power seen in our data .",
    "they indicate in their conclusions that there are a number of reasons to suspect that the predictions are an overestimate of the true power from intrinsic correlations ; however , it is possible that a large portion of our b - mode power is due to this effect .",
    "note that if this is the case , then @xcite calculate that the power should be approximately evenly split between the e - mode and b - mode , in which case , the e - b fit above is the appropriate one for weak lensing constraints .",
    "table  [ lensingtable ] lists some of the most recent weak - lensing results , quoting the value of @xmath11 at @xmath243 and @xmath244 in order to make the comparisons more obvious .",
