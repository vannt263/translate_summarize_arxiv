    "there is currently much effort devoted to applications of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite to exclusive @xmath0 decays @xcite .",
    "scet provides a systematic framework in which to discuss qcd factorization theorems for these processes @xcite and power corrections using the language of effective field theory .",
    "the hadronic states relevant to exclusive decays such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 contain highly energetic , collinear partons inside the final - state light mesons , and soft partons inside the initial @xmath0 meson .",
    "understanding the intricate interplay between soft and collinear degrees of freedom is a challenge that one hopes to address using the effective theory .",
    "this interplay is relevant even in simpler processes such as semileptonic @xmath0 decays near @xmath5 , which are described in terms of heavy - to - light form factors at large recoil .",
    "power counting in scet is based on an expansion parameter @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a large scale ( typically @xmath8 in @xmath0 decays ) , and @xmath9 is of order the qcd scale .",
    "a complication in scet is that different components of particle momenta and fields may scale differently with the large scale @xmath10 . to make this scaling explicit one introduces two light - like vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 satisfying @xmath13 and @xmath14 . typically , @xmath11 is the direction of an outgoing fast hadron ( or a jet of hadrons ) .",
    "any 4-vector can then be decomposed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the light - like vectors @xmath17 are defined by this relation .",
    "the relevant scet degrees of freedom describing the partons in the external hadronic states of exclusive @xmath0 decays are soft and collinear , where @xmath18 for soft momenta and @xmath19 for collinear momenta . here and below we indicate the scaling properties of the components @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding effective - theory fields and their scaling relations are @xmath21 ( soft heavy quark ) , @xmath22 ( soft light quark ) , @xmath23 ( soft gluon ) , and @xmath24 ( collinear quark ) , @xmath25 ( collinear gluon ) .",
    "the collinear quark is described by a 2-component spinor subject to the constraint @xmath26 .",
    "short - distance fluctuations in exclusive @xmath0 decays are usually characterized by two different large scales : the hard scale @xmath27 associated with off - shell fluctuations of the heavy quark , and the `` hard - collinear '' scale @xmath28 arising in interactions involving both soft and collinear degrees of freedom . in order to disentangle the physics associated with these two scales",
    "it is sometimes useful to perform the matching of full qcd onto the low - energy effective theory in two steps , by going through an intermediate effective theory ( called scet@xmath29 ) containing `` hard - collinear '' modes with virtualities @xmath30 as dynamical degrees of freedom . in a second step scet@xmath29",
    "is matched onto the final theory ( called scet@xmath31 ) containing near on - shell soft and collinear partons only . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the structure of this final effective theory .    at leading order in power counting the effective strong - interaction lagrangian of scet@xmath31",
    "splits up into separate lagrangians for the soft and collinear fields .",
    "this property implies factorization of many processes involving soft and collinear partons at leading power in @xmath32 .",
    "factorization is however not guaranteed for quantities that vanish at leading power , such as heavy - to - light form factors at large recoil .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that at subleading order in @xmath32 interactions between soft and collinear particles occur , which can violate factorization .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : messenger ] , these interactions can be mediated by the exchange of a short - distance hard - collinear mode , or by a long - distance `` messenger particle '' with momentum scaling @xmath33 , where the transverse momentum components can be at most of @xmath34 .",
    "we will argue in the present work that these two exchange mechanisms contribute under different kinematic conditions .",
    "in particular , the hard - collinear exchange requires the presence of collinear particles in the initial state and so is irrelevant for scet applications to @xmath0 decays .",
    "the scaling of the long - distance messenger particle is such that it can couple to both soft and collinear fields without taking them far off - shell .",
    "it was left open in @xcite whether the messenger exchange should be described in terms of a new field in the effective theory , or by considering the exchange particle as a soft ( or collinear ) field subject to certain constraints on some of its momentum components .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     translated to momentum space , this particular position dependence of the fields enforces that the minus component of the total collinear momentum flowing into the vertex exits again through collinear lines .",
    "an analogous statement holds for the plus component of the soft momenta .",
    "the momentum - conservation @xmath35-functions associated with the above vertices therefore reads @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the sum of all collinear and @xmath38 the sum of all soft momenta ( ingoing minus outgoing ) connected to the vertex . as classical scattering processes ,",
    "these interactions are rather exceptional : the operator ( [ lsc1 ] ) , for example , contributes only to the forward scattering of a collinear quark and a soft quark .",
    "when inserted into loop diagrams , such exceptional momentum configurations in general do not give rise to non - zero contributions . to see this ,",
    "let us analyze the one - loop qcd diagram shown in figure  [ fig : hardcoll ] using the strategy of regions .",
    "one finds that the graph receives a contribution from the region where all propagators are hard or hard - collinear . in the effective theory",
    "this contribution is represented by the first diagram on the right - hand side .",
    "there are also contributions from regions where two propagators of the loop are soft ( or collinear ) and all others hard or hard - collinear .",
    "these correspond to effective - theory diagrams ( not shown ) where a collinear or soft gluon is emitted from the weak vertex and absorbed by one of the quarks .",
    "however , no contribution arises that would correspond to the last diagram in figure  [ fig : hardcoll ] , which involves the interaction ( [ lsc2 ] ) denoted by the black square .",
    "first , it is impossible to assign a loop momentum and external momenta in the full - theory diagram such that the exceptional momentum configuration corresponding to the last graph ( where the gluon connected to the heavy quark is soft and that connected to the outgoing light quark is collinear ) would be enforced .",
    "this configuration would require the loop momentum to scale like @xmath39 , in which case the denominators of the qcd loop integral can be simplified as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these denominator structures precisely correspond to the multipole - expanded form of the operator ( [ lsc2 ] ) .",
    "note that the plus component of the loop momentum does not propagate into soft lines , while its minus component does not propagate into collinear lines . as a result , the integration over @xmath43 vanishes if the components @xmath44 of the external soft momenta all have the same sign , because then the contour can be deformed away from the poles .",
    "similarly , the integration over @xmath45 vanishes if the components @xmath46 of the external collinear momenta all have the same sign .",
    "the same conclusion is reached upon analyzing a general loop diagram involving ( [ lsc1 ] ) or ( [ lsc2 ] ) : non - zero contributions from these interactions can only occur in processes which involve soft and collinear particles in both the initial and final state , and these interactions therefore do not contribute in decays of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "this is a consequence of the coleman ",
    "norton theorem @xcite , which states that on - shell singularities in feynman diagrams correspond to classically allowed scattering processes .",
    "the above conclusion also applies to the analysis in @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative soft - collinear rescattering mechanism introduced there should not be described in terms of ( [ lsc1 ] ) , but rather through the long - distance messenger exchange interaction ( [ mess1 ] ) .    as a final note ,",
    "let us mention that the same arguments ensure that there are no induced self - interactions of the type ( [ ssc ] ) among only soft or only collinear fields , i.e. , the effective lagrangians @xmath47 and @xmath48 are not altered by integrating out the soft - collinear modes .",
    "the corresponding correlation functions @xmath49 etc .   vanish , since the contour can be closed avoiding the poles in the complex plane .",
    "this ensures that soft - collinear fields can only be exchanged in graphs involving both soft and collinear fields .",
    "we have argued that the version of soft - collinear effective theory appropriate for the discussion of exclusive @xmath0 decays such as @xmath50 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 should include a new mode in addition to soft and collinear fields , which can interact with both soft and collinear particles without taking them far off - shell .",
    "the relevance of these messenger fields has been demonstrated using the example of a triangle diagram with one soft and one collinear external momentum .",
    "we have then developed the formalism incorporating the corresponding quark and gluon fields into the soft - collinear effective lagrangian .    in the strong - interaction sector of the effective theory",
    "the leading - order interactions of soft - collinear fields with soft or collinear fields can be removed using field redefinitions .",
    "the remaining interactions are power suppressed .",
    "we have explicitly worked out the leading terms involving quark fields .",
    "we stress that this decoupling in the qcd sector of the theory does not necessarily imply that soft - collinear modes can be ignored at leading order in power counting",
    ". this would only be true in cases where the decoupling transformation leaves external operators such as weak - interaction currents invariant . when the messenger fields are `` integrated out '' in the functional integral they give rise to highly non - local induced interactions between soft and collinear fields , which appear at the same order in power counting as short - distance interactions among these fields induced by the exchange of hard - collinear modes .",
    "however , only the long - distance interactions induced by soft - collinear exchange graphs are kinematically allowed in @xmath0 decays , where no collinear particles are present in the initial state .",
    "a puzzling aspect of our analysis is the finding of a relevant momentum region corresponding to virtualities that are parametrically below the qcd scale @xmath51 .",
    "however , our discussion in section  [ sec : sudakov ] illustrates that the same phenomenon arises in the case of the sudakov form factor , if the external massless particles have off - shell momenta scaling like @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath9 . then perturbatively the ultra - soft region of loop momenta @xmath54 gives rise to leading - order contributions and acts as a `` messenger '' between the two collinear particles , just like the soft - collinear modes connecting soft and collinear particles in our case .",
    "the fact that modes with @xmath55 represent very long - range fluctuations compared to the scale of hadronic systems is not necessarily an argument against their existence .",
    "it is to some extent a consequence of dimensional regularization and analyticity that the relevant momentum region is @xmath56 and not @xmath57 , in which case the virtuality would be of order @xmath58 .",
    "ultimately , it is not the virtuality that is important but the fact that the plus and minus components of soft - collinear momenta are commensurate with certain components of collinear or soft momenta . as an analogy ,",
    "let us recall the case of the hydrogen lamb shift , in which `` ultra - soft '' modes with time and space components of momentum scaling like @xmath59 are important .",
    "these modes have virtuality @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the typical momentum of the hydrogen atom .",
    "also in this case it is not the off - shellness that matters , but rather the fact that one of the components ( the energy ) is comparable to that of the bound - state system .    finally , let us mention that the introduction of a mass term @xmath62 in the propagator labeled with @xmath63 in figure  [ fig : triangle ] would change the analysis of regions . in this case",
    "there would be no contribution from the soft - collinear region , since the loop momentum @xmath64 in the soft - collinear propagator @xmath65 could be taylor - expanded and no pinch singularities would occur .",
    "however , this `` simplification '' comes at a price : after the introduction of the mass term , the loop integrals occurring in the soft and collinear region are no longer regulated dimensionally .",
    "in order to obtain the expansion of the massive integral using the strategy of regions , additional analytic regulators have to be introduced on the soft and collinear propagators @xcite . the procedure is straightforward as long as one is only interested in the expansion of a given loop integral , but would complicate the construction of the effective theory since the analytic regulators destroy longitudinal boost and gauge invariance .",
    "we believe it is fair to say that to date it is not known how to consistently incorporate masses of @xmath66 into soft - collinear effective theory .",
    "a related question one might worry about is whether the scaling laws for the propagator functions @xmath67 describing the soft - collinear exchange , which follow from the power - counting rules of the effective theory , could be invalidated by some non - perturbative effects not seen at the level of feynman diagrams , such as a generation of mass terms in exact propagators . in our opinion",
    "such effects would not only upset power counting but threaten the usefulness of the effective theory as a whole .",
    "for now we take the conservative point of view that in order to be useful the effective theory should at least reproduce correctly the analytic properties of perturbation theory . as we have shown , the inclusion of soft - collinear modes is then an indispensable part in the construction of the effective lagrangian .",
