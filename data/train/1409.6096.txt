    "in classical physics the observation that at long times systems thermalize led to the birth of statistical mechanics as a very effective description of nature . however , the issue of how equilibration and thermalization arise in isolated quantum ( many - body ) systems is still highly debated  @xcite .",
    "recent years have witnessed a resurgence of interest in this topic  @xcite , due to its relevance in cold atoms experiments  @xcite .",
    "one possible mechanism explaining thermalization is the so - called eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth )  @xcite .",
    "the eth can be stated as follows : in the thermodynamic limit the eigenstate expectation value ( eev ) @xmath4 of a typical few - body observable @xmath5 in an eigenstate @xmath6 of a many - body hamiltonian @xmath7 with eigenenergy @xmath8 ( and energy density @xmath9 , with @xmath3 being the number of sites ) is equal to the microcanonical average @xmath10 , at the mean energy density @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 here @xmath13 is a small energy scale that can be sent to zero in the thermodynamic limit , and @xmath14 denotes the number of energy levels @xmath15 in the energy window @xmath16 .",
    "the underlying idea of eth is that eigenstates with similar energy give similar eevs . as a consequence , the standard deviation of the fluctuations , @xmath17^{1/2}$ ] ,",
    "vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , which implies that @xmath18 becomes a `` smooth '' function of @xmath19 .",
    "still , two main interpretations of eth are possible  @xcite . in the so - called _ weak _ eth , `` rare '' ( as opposed to _ typical _",
    "@xcite ) eigenstates @xmath20 , for which @xmath21 , are allowed for any finite size .",
    "the behavior of the fluctuations reflects that the fraction of rare eigenstates vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "interestingly , these rare eigenstates appear for hamiltonians corresponding to random matrices  @xcite . on the other hand , in the _ strong _ eth these rare eigenstates are not present , i.e. , all eigenstates are thermal .",
    "this difference is dramatically reflected in the finite - size scaling behavior of @xmath22 , and it is related to the difference between integrable  @xcite and non integrable models . in the latter",
    "the strong eth holds , and it is now well established that fluctuations decay exponentially with system size  @xcite .",
    "exact diagonalization studies demonstrated that for typical observables @xmath23  @xcite , with @xmath24 the dimension of the full hilbert space .",
    "oppositely , in integrable models a much slower decay is expected  @xcite , which is associated with the presence of an extensive number of local conservation laws  @xcite . yet , despite integrability , numerical studies of eth are hampered by severe finite - size effects , and a precise finite - size scaling analysis of @xmath25 is still lacking ( see , however , ref .",
    "for a finite - size scaling study of eth in the lieb - liniger model ) .",
    "in this work , using a numerical implementation ( cf . ref .   for the details ) of state - of - the - art bethe ansatz results  @xcite , we perform a finite - size scaling analysis of the eth in the spin-@xmath0 isotropic heisenberg ( @xmath1 ) chain .",
    "specifically , here we focus on the @xmath26-spin reduced density matrix @xmath27 . given the state of the chain @xmath28 and a block @xmath29 of @xmath26 contiguous spins , the corresponding @xmath27",
    "is obtained by tracing over the degrees of freedom of the remaining spins ( block @xmath30 ) in the full - system density matrix @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32  @xcite . from @xmath27",
    "it is straightforward to obtain any multi - spin correlation function with support on @xmath26 contiguous sites of the chain .",
    "our main result is that the weak eth holds for all the matrix elements of @xmath27 , meaning that for the vast majority of the eigenstates ( i.e. , typical eigenstates ) one has @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 denoting the microcanonical average ) , in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this scenario is made rigorous by a large scale analysis of the eigenstate - to - eigenstate fluctuations of @xmath27 .",
    "precisely , we numerically demonstrate that fluctuations are normally distributed , and their standard deviation @xmath35 decays as @xmath36 , for large chains .",
    "interestingly , the same behavior is observed in free models  @xcite , and it is in sharp contrast with the exponential decay found in non - integrable systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , using standard thermodynamics bethe ansatz ( tba ) results  @xcite , we provide an ensemble representative state ( ers ) , and the reduced density matrix @xmath37 thereof .",
    "this is a good approximation for the reduced density matrix obtained from typical mid - spectrum eigenstates of the finite chain . in particular",
    ", one has @xmath38 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "from @xmath27 we construct the conserved charges @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) of the @xmath1 chain  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we numerically observe that the eev of the first non - trivial charge densities @xmath41 vanishes for typical eigenstates .",
    "one consequence of our results is that , despite the @xmath1 chain being integrable , the unitary dynamics ensuing from thermal - like initial states might lead to thermal behavior at long times , in agreeement with what has been found in ref .  .",
    "finally , we investigate the entanglement entropy  @xcite @xmath42 of the ers .",
    "we provide robust numerical evidence for the volume law scaling @xmath43 , which implies that typical mid - spectrum eigenstates exhibit extensive entanglement entropy .",

    "we set @xmath49 in   and use periodic boundary conditions identifying sites @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "both the total spin @xmath52 and the total magnetization @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being the number of down spins ( particles ) , are conserved quantities for @xmath7 .",
    "thus its eigenstates can be labeled by @xmath55 ( equivalently by @xmath54 , or the particle density @xmath56 ) .",
    "here we mainly consider the situation with fixed density @xmath57 .",
    "in the algebraic bethe ansatz approach  @xcite the eigenstates of the @xmath1 chain in the sector with given @xmath54 are constructed from the so - called rapidities @xmath58 as @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 is the ferromagnetic ( `` vacuum '' ) state , and @xmath61 a @xmath62 matrix  @xcite .",
    "the rapidities are obtained by solving the bethe equations @xmath63 in principle , any choice of the so - called bethe numbers @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) identifies a set of solutions of  , and an eigenstate of   thereof , with energy eigenvalue @xmath66 .",
    "although , in general , @xmath67 , here we consider only real rapidities , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , we focus on the eigenstates with maximum magnetization @xmath69 , which implies @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding bethe numbers are given as @xmath71 , with @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "finally , for each @xmath3 we consider @xmath73 eigenstates of  , which are obtained by sampling uniformly the bethe numbers @xmath74 .",
    "we should mention that here we choose @xmath75 , meaning that we are considering the infinite temperature canonical ensemble , instead of a microcanonical one .",
    "however , we anticipate that this does not affect our results .    formally ,",
    "for any eigenstate @xmath76 one can write the corresponding reduced density matrix @xmath27 as ( @xmath77 ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is the @xmath81 identity matrix .",
    "exact formulas for the multi - spin correlation functions appearing in   have been obtained recently within the algebraic bethe ansatz approach  @xcite .",
    "their numerical implementation is a challenging task ( cf . ref .   for details ) , and the computational cost for calculating a generic matrix element of @xmath27 is roughly @xmath82 .",
    "nonetheless , this method allows one to effectively calculate @xmath83 for @xmath84 and chains with @xmath85 .",

    "this suggests , as expected , that for large @xmath3 the infinite temperature canonical ensemble can be replaced with a microcanonical one centered around @xmath106 .",
    "correspondingly , figure  [ fig1 ] ( a)-(d ) demonstrate that the eigenstate - to - eigenstate fluctuations of @xmath107 decrease upon increasing @xmath3 , which implies that in the thermodynamic limit typical eigenstates yield the same @xmath107 , and one has @xmath108 .",
