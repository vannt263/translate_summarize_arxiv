    "experimental characterization of warm dense matter and strongly coupled plasmas becomes increasingly powerful with the development of new methods for the creation and probing of such states .",
    "for instance , x - ray scattering allows not only for the measurement of equation of state data ( like in traditional shock wave experiments , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but also to obtain structural , dynamic , and collective properties of matter @xcite . with these new possibilities ,",
    "one is now able to probe the physics of high energy density matter as it is encountered during inertial confinement fusion or in the interior of planets .",
    "the creation of the these high energy density states in the laboratory requires large and fast energy inputs into matter . since static techniques , like diamond anvil cells ,",
    "are restricted to lower temperatures and densities by the given stress point of the material , one relies on dynamic experiments applying intense particle beams and lasers to heat and compress the material under investigation .",
    "inevitably , highly nonequilibrium states are produced with the energy being pumped mainly either into the ion or the electron subsystem .",
    "such states are of great interest by itself since they reveil many dynamic and collective properties of the system more clearly .    a good understanding of nonequilibrium states is also needed for definitive measurements of equilibrium properties . after a very short time of approximately an inverse plasma frequency ,",
    "electrons and ions have established temperatures within their subsystems and a full kinetic description is not necessary later on .",
    "apart from the final hydrodynamic response , temperature equilibration thus takes the longest time of all relaxation processes driven by the intial energy deposition and defines the minimum time delay between the pump and probe pulses needed for equilibrium measurements .",
    "temperature equilibration is furthermore interesting since its time scale is experimentally accessible .",
    "indeed , experiments investigating dense plasmas , both laser- and shock - produced , found relaxation times considerably longer than predicted by classical landau - spitzer formula @xcite .",
    "two shortcomings of this easy - to - use approach were associated with these discrepancies : the neglect of collective excitations and the use of classical collisions .",
    "a full quantum binary collision approach yields however even larger energy transfer rates @xcite . considering independent collective modes in the electronic and ionic subsystems within the fermi - golden - rule ( fgr ) approach yields rates very close to the landau - spitzer results @xcite .",
    "therefore , collective modes in fully coupled electron - ion systems seem to be the only candidate to explain the lower electron - ion energy transfer measured .    more complex descriptions of temperature relaxation involve the interplay of all contributions to the internal energy .",
    "in addition to the kinetic parts interesting for temperature relaxation , correlations and exchange energies @xcite and the ionisation equilibrium including excitations @xcite can be important .",
    "the latter processes have been shown to considerable influence the relaxation under conditions far from equilibrium , but are not sufficient to explain the measured slower temperature equilibration .    here , we assume ionisation , recombination , and charge transfer processes to be completed and concentrate on the electron - ion energy transfer including collisions and collective excitations in a fully coupled system .",
    "we use a quantum statistical description which avoids any _ ad hoc _ cutoffs known from classical descriptions and enables us to rigorously derive formulas for the energy transfer rates within a given approximation scheme .",
    "the occurance and magnitude of coupled mode effects on temperature relaxation are still under discussion ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the beginning",
    ", we therefore consider weakly coupled plasmas , where the classical coupling parameter , @xmath0 with @xmath1 is small for all species . in this limit",
    ", we can employ the well - established random phase approximation ( rpa ) to describe the dynamic response of fully coupled systems and the quantum version of the lenard - balescu equation @xcite on the kinetic level .",
    "we show that the weak coupling version of the coupled mode formula derived by dharma - wardana & perrot @xcite follows .",
    "moreover , we re - write the density response functions of their approach in terms of dielectric functions and obtain a form that can be evaluated by standard integration procedures .",
    "under certain conditions , we observe a lowering of the energy transfer rates compared to the landau - spitzer and the fgr approaches in the order of a factor of two .",
    "these differences are connected to the occurance of ion acoustic modes and a related redistribution of weight in the dynamic density response toward smaller frequencies .",
    "this fact also explains why a simpler approximation like fgr is suitable for other parameters .",
    "the most striking fact is that coupled mode effects can occur also for very high electron temperatures where the landau - spitzer approach is believed to work well .",
    "we have good control over our approximation scheme .",
    "the results in the well - understood weak coupling limit can thus serve as a benchmark for more approximate approaches .",
    "in particular , numerical simulations such as applied in refs .",
    "@xcite should be tested against these analytic results since they are based on classical mechanics and apply pseudo - potentials to approximately incorporate the qantum nature of the electrons as an uncontrolled approximation .    as an extension to the rpa scheme",
    ", we consider strongly coupled ions where the additional correlation effects are treated on the level of static local field corrections .",
    "the additional shifts in the mode structure can further reduce the electron - ion energy transfer . for compressed silicon as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we report large reductions although coupled mode effects on the rpa level do not change the rates much .",
    "in addition , we discuss the influence of degeneracy , mass and ion charge .",
    "changes of the kinetic energy of species @xmath2 , that is @xmath3 , are fully determind by the changes of the one - particle wigner distribution of the species @xmath4 e_a & = & f_a(,t ) + & = & _ b i_ab(p , t ) .",
    "[ balance ] in the second line , two - particle collision integrals @xmath5 were introduced by using a general kinetic equation for homogeneous and isotropic systems : @xmath6 .",

    "there exists a hierachy of approximations for the collision integrals @xmath5 @xcite which via eq .",
    "( [ balance ] ) also defines the quality of the related energy transfer rates .",
    "the different kinetic equations can be devided into two classes : the first describes the interactions by binary collisions only ( landau equation @xcite and boltzmann - like equation @xcite ) , the second includes also collective effects such as dynamic screening ( lenard - balescu - type kinetic equations @xcite ) . the mutual influence of electrons and ions via the common dielectric function of the plasma ( coupled collective modes ) is here included and predicted to strongly modify the energy transfer in two - temperature plasmas @xcite .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the landau - spitzer formula ( [ ls_time ] ) suffers from a number of deficits .",
    "the most crucial one is the classical description of electron - ion collisions which may result in negative coulomb logarithms and rates .",
    "well - defined energy transfer rates in the binary collision approximation can however be derived based on the collision integral of the quantum boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "if the collision cross sections needed are calculated from the two - particle schrdinger equation , these rates consider strong electron - ion collisions as well but collective excitations can not be included since statically screened interactions are used .",
    "most binary collision approaches are also limited to systems with nondegenerate electrons due to the way the collision cross sections are calculated .",
    "the collective excitations of a weakly coupled plasma are fully accounted for in the well - known random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "since the electrons and ions are treated as one combined system in this approach , their mutual influence is naturally accounted for and , so called , coupled collective modes arise .",
    "this becomes particularly clear when considering the dielectric function on the rpa level that includes a sum over all species ^rpa(k , ) = 1 - _ a v_aa(k ) _",

    "the kinetic equation corresponding to the rpa is the lenard - balescu equation @xcite . here",
    ", we will use its quantum generalization that accounts for degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the energy transfer rates are again obtained by inserting the appropriate collision integral into the energy balance ( [ balance ] ) .",
    "details of the derivation can be found in appendix [ cm_derivation ] and the final result is e^cm_e i & = & - 4 _ i _ 0^    & & ^0_ee(k ) ^0_ii(k ) .",

    "the zeros of the total dielectric function in the denominator determine the collective excitations of the fully coupled system .",
    "thus , the energy transfer rate ( [ cm_transf ] ) carries the label ` cm ' for coupled mode .",
    "it is applicable for weakly coupled plasmas without any restriction with respect to degeneracy . for weakly coupled plasmas ,",
    "equation ( [ cm_transf ] ) is equivalent to the cm formula given by dharma - wardana & perrot ( see eq .  ( 50 ) in ref .",

    "we would like to emphasis again that expression ( [ cm_transf ] ) represents a cm formula for the energy transfer rates in weakly coupled , two - temperature systems .",
    "it was derived from the well - established ( quantum ) lenard - balescu equation in rpa without further approximations .",
    "therefore , it can serve as a benchmark for more approximate approaches and numerical simulations in the weak coupling limit .    one of the more approximate , but easier to calculate , approaches for the energy transfer rates is the fermi golden rule ( fgr ) approach . here",
    ", electrons and ions are treated as separate subsystems .",
    "accordingly , both subsystems have their own distinct dielectric functions @xmath18 .",
    "the expression for the energy transfer rates reflects this fact by having a product of these dielectric functions in the denominator @xcite e^fgr_e i & = & - 4 _ i _ 0^ + & & ^0_ee(k ) ^0_ii(k ) .",

    "to evaluate the corresponding differences in the energy transfer rates is the main purpose of this paper .      in dense plasmas , the coulomb correlations between the particles can strongly effect the mode spectrum and scattering cross sections .",

    ", the ionic dielectric function reads @xcite _ i(k , ) = 1- .",

[ lfc ] the spatial correlations in @xmath21 can be calculated by molecular dynamics or monte carlo simulations as well as integral equations like the hypernetted chain approach @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the changes due to slfc influence only the cm rates . within the fgr approach ,",
    "the @xmath22-integration is essentially determined by the f - sum rule @xcite which gives the same result independent of the approximation level used .",

    "the ionic modes used in the fgr and cm approaches are qualitatively different . for small momenta ,",
    "the ion subsystem in fgr has always a plasmon mode which is similar to the electron plasmon ( just scaled by @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) as well as an acoustic mode .",
    "the coupling between the electronic and ionic subsystems as included in the cm formula leads to screening of the ionic plasmon mode which therefore turns into a weakly damped upper acoustic branch of the ionic spectrum . the finite mode frequency at @xmath31 is thus shifted to much smaller frequencies that linearly increase with @xmath32 .",
    "interestingly , this new acoustic branch becomes more plasmon - like for larger temperature differences and momenta and coincides with the prediction for an isolated ion system in the unscreened limit with @xmath33 .",
    "for the important small @xmath32 values , the modes are however for all finite electron temperatures acoustic ( in contrast to the fgr modes ) .",
    "[ mode_spectrum ] also clearly demonstrates that the ionic modes in the coupled system cease to exist if the temperature difference , @xmath34 , becomes too small .",
    "the mode frequency is , for small @xmath32 , in very good approximation given by the zeros of the real part of the dielectric function .",
    "while the product of dielectric functions in the fgr approach has always zeros , the summation over species in the full dielectric function ( [ full_dk ] ) puts strict limits to the occurrence of ionic modes and changes their location in @xmath22-space ; a fact that is crucial for the understanding of the cm effect on the energy relaxation .",
    "to estimate under which conditions ion acoustic modes in the coupled plasma occur , we have to balance the electronic terms which can be treated statically and the frequency - dependent ionic part .",
    "it is well - known that a zero in the real part of the full dielectric function can be achieved under the condition @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "a more precise analysis ( see appendix [ modes_when ] ) shows that either of the relations @xcite",
    "t_i 0.27z_it_e & & n_e_e^3 1 , + t_i 0.27z_it_f & & n_e_e^3 1 [ temp_cond ] must hold to allow for an ion acoustic mode in coupled electron - ion systems .",
    "the upper case gives the limit for nondegenerate electrons while the second line sets the limit for highly degenerate electrons ( @xmath36 is the thermal wave length ) . in the high density case ,",
    "the important temperature scale is thus defined by the electron fermi temperature @xmath37 . accordingly",
    ", sharp ion acoustic modes may also occur for @xmath38 if the electron density is high enough .",
    "the fgr formula for the energy transfer rates ( [ fgr_transf ] ) always features sharp peaks at small wave numbers that are roughly located at the ion plasmon frequency .",
    "the exact value of the mode frequency @xmath39 can be easily obtained numerically . to avoid the sharp peaks ,",
    "these contributions around the location of the mode are cut out .",
    "the cut out contributions can be easily calculated from the differences to an @xmath22-integral that allows for an evaluation by the f - sum rule @xcite .",
    "thus , we have to compute + & & = _ 0^ f ( ) - _ i^2 f ( ) . + here , @xmath40 is the difference in the mode occupation numbers .",
    "the function @xmath41 includes the electronic dielectric functions and @xmath42 , that is , @xmath43 . in this way",
    ", the sharp plasmon peak has been removed and then treated exactly .",
    "all remaining integrals are over smooth functions .",
    "unfortunately , an evaluation as for the fgr formula is impossible for the cm integrand . here ,",

    "the functions under the @xmath22-integral can , however , be rearranged to allow for an integration with standard routines .",
    "for this aim , we artificially decompose the total dielectric function into an electron and an ion part ^rpa(k , ) = 1 & + [ _ e(k , ) - 1 ] & + _ e(k , ) + & + [ _ i(k , ) - 1 ] & + _ i(k , ) .",

    ", it can not compensate the loss in weight . for a pure ion system , as in the fgr approach ,",
    "almost the entire contribution stems from the plasmon peak whereas the main contribution to the cm integral comes from the particle peak .",
    "the above points are the basics to understand the lowering of the energy transfer due to coupled collective modes .",
    "figure [ example2 ] demonstrates that the cm effect is caused by differences at small wave numbers . here",
    ", the ion acoustic mode exists and the influence of the electrons shifts the weight to smaller @xmath32 as shown in fig .",
    "[ mode_spectrum ] .",
    "thus , the overall contributions to the cm integral are of the same order as the particle peak of the fgr which itself is negligible compared to the ion plasmon peak .",
    "accordingly , small @xmath32-values give almost no contribution in the cm expression compared to the fgr results as shown in fig .",
    "[ example2 ] .",
    "if these small @xmath32 are important , significantly reduced cm rates , compared to fgr , can be expected . for large momentum transfers @xmath32 ,",
    "the situation is different : here , the ion acoustic mode ( in cm ) and the plasmon mode ( in fgr ) do not exist anymore and the @xmath22-integrals of both approaches merge . if such larger @xmath32 dominate in expressions ( [ cm_transf ] ) and ( [ fgr_transf ] ) , no coupled mode effects can be expected .",

    "first , we will concentrate on weakly coupled plasmas and describe the plasma within the random phase approximation . based on the methods presented above ,",
    "this allows us to calculate the cm energy transfer rates on a well - established approximation level ( similar to that of the quantum lenard - balescu equation ) without any further approximations . in a second step",

    "however , considerable quantitative differences arise when comparing the approximation levels presented .",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath49k versus electron temperature .",
    "the applied approximations are the coupled mode formula within rpa ( [ cm_transf ] ) and with static local field corrections ( [ lfc ] ) , fermi s golden rule approach ( [ fgr_transf ] ) , and the landau - spitzer formual ( [ ls_own ] ) . ]    in the first region , the fgr , cm and cm+lfc results agree since here ion acoustic or coupled collective modes do not existent .",
    "as expected , the ls formula gives different results in this region since the coulomb logarith is not well - defined for these plasmas with relatively cold , degenerate electrons . at electron temperatures of about @xmath54k ,",

    "[ example2 ] ) , the cm results show here a considerable lowering compared to fgr rates .",
    "although strong coupling effects are small in this example , the effect of the local field corrections is also largest in this region .    for very high electron temperatures ,",
    "the landau - spitzer formula is believed to be accurate due to the very weak electron - ion and electron - electron coupling .",

    "@xcite ) in this limit .",
    "the differences between the fgr and ls results for smaller electron temperatures are due to the different definition of `` coulomb logarithms '' as the fgr approach was shown to reduce to a ls - like formula @xcite .",

    "the actual temperature difference becomes irrelevant when searching for cm effects .",

    "[ cmfgr ] where the well established cm effect for @xmath58 vanishes for higher ion temperatures .",

    "[ si ] considers the situation in shocked silicon plasmas as prepared in the experiment by ng _",
    "for this case , the electron temperature is lower than the ion temperature .",
    "the electrons are highly degenerate so that according to eq .",
    "( [ temp_cond ] ) cm effects are possible since the fermi temperature considerably exceeds the ion temperature .",
    "the ions are also strongly coupled , @xmath67 , and local field corrections to the response functions have a larger effect as in the examples given so far .",
    "when analysing the case , the first point to realise is that neither the usual landau - spitzer approach nor the brysk formula @xcite that ( partially ) accounts for degeneracy effects is well defined .",
    "both formulas contain a coulomb logarithm that either becomes negative or very small when considering straight line trajectories or hyperbolic orbits , respectively .",
    "thus , the coulomb logarithm is usually clamped at some larger value . here",
    ", we use @xmath68 for comparison .",
    "still both the ls and brysk formula give energy transfer rates that are orders of magnitude larger than the fgr or cm results which acount for degenerate electrons in a regular fashion .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the experimentally observed facts .    comparing the rates obtained by the cm and fgr expressions",
    ", one makes an interesting observation : on the rpa level both approaches yield more or less the same results although ion acoustic modes are present in the system .",
    "the weighting due to the electron fermi distributions favors however larger @xmath32 values where no collective mode exist .",
    "however , we find a further reduction of the cm rates when the effect of strong coupling is included by static local field corrections .",
    "since the fgr approach naturally includes strong coupling effect @xcite , no changes occur within this approach .",
    "accordingly , we find now a factor of roughly two between the rates calculated by the cm and fgr expressions , respectively .",
    "thus , we can confirm the occurance of coupled mode effects under these conditions although the main effect arises from the correct treatment of degeneracy .",
    "we investigated the electron - ion energy transfer rates in two - temperature plasmas with special emphasis on coupled mode effects .",
    "for weakly coupled plasmas , the starting point was the quantum version of the lennard - balescu kinetic equation which naturally includes fully coupled collective excitations in the screening function .",
    "it was shown that a straightforward derivation without further approximations yields a coupled mode expression for the energy relaxation rates .",
    "this kinetic approach is consistent and accurate for weakly coupled plasmas of any degeneracy .",
    "it can be easily extended to plasmas with strongly coupled ions by including ( static ) local field corrections .    for certain conditions ,",
    "the coupled mode expression yield considerably reduced electron - ion energy transfers when compared to the ls and fgr approaches .",
    "a detailed analysis showed that this reduction can be traced back to the occurance of ion acoustic modes and a related redistribution of weight in the dielectric response function .",
    "this reflects the fact that the coupled mode approach consideres a much more realistic mode structure .",
    "precise conditions for the occurrence of ion accoustic modes and the coupled mode reduction of the energy transfer rates were derived .",
    "interestingly , the cm reduction is preserved for very high electron temperatures where the rates are roughly a factor of two less than the ones calculated with the fgr or ls approaches .",
    "an agreement between cm and fgr expressions can only be reached if the temperature difference is small or the ion temperature is high enough to prohibit the occurance of ion acoustic modes .",
    "the results presented here are concistent with experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite findings of lowered electron - ion energy transfers and thus longer equilibration times .",
    "in particular , the strong reduction of the equilibration rates in shocked silicon is in qualitative agreement with measurements .",
    "the experiments probed however regimes where collective modes as well as strong binary collisions and changing potential energies are of importance .",
    "thus , a full description must also include these effects at least on a level as described in refs .",
    "the conditions for the occurance of cm effects derived also explain why no or very small cm reductions have been seen in recent numerical simulations @xcite .",
