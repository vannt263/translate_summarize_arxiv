    "since the standard model ( sm ) can not give an explanation for dark matter , new physics is expected . in this talk , we review the signatures of dark matter in two models which contain @xmath2 triplet scalars with the hypercharges y=0 and 2 under @xmath3 , respectively @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the triplets are odd under an @xmath4 symmetry so that they neither directly couple to the sm fermions nor develop vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , while the neutral components of the triplets are the dark particles .",
    "we will refer to the models as the inert triplet models ( itms ) .",
    "the number of new parameters in the y=0 itm is three compared to the sm , which is the same as those in the inert singlet model @xcite .",
    "clearly , the y=0 itm is one of the minimal inert models .",
    "similarly , the y=2 itm like the inert doublet model  @xcite@xmath5@xcite has five new parameters .",
    "the relic abundance of the cold dark matter in the universe is determined to be  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the scaled current hubble parameter in units of @xmath8 . on the other hand , the direct searches also provide constraints on dark matter .",
    "for example , the spin - independent ( si ) dark matter cross section has to satisfy  @xcite @xmath9 note that to have the above constraint , we have assumed that dark matter is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) with its mass smaller than @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "we extend the sm by adding a zero hypercharge @xmath2 triplet scalar with an unbroken @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the relevant lagrangian is given by @xmath11 + \\lambda_1 |h^\\dag h|^2 + \\lambda_2 \\left({{\\rm tr}}[t^2]\\right)^2 + \\lambda_3 h^\\dag h\\ { { \\rm tr}}[t^2]\\ , ,   \\label{eq:3vertex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the covariant derivative including the sm gauge bosons , and the sm higgs doublet @xmath13 and the triplet @xmath14 scalars are defined as @xmath15 respectively , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the stability condition of the higgs potential requires @xmath18 the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3vertex ] ) becomes a local minimum if and only if @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "after @xmath21 acquires the vev , the scalars gain the following masses : @xmath22 at tree level . due to the radiative corrections @xcite ,",
    "the masses of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are split as @xmath25 hence , @xmath26 turns out to be the lightest component of the triplet scalar with its stability protected by the @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "since the triplet scalar is added to the sm , one may expect that it affects the so - called oblique ( s and t ) parameters .",
    "in general , however , an @xmath27 triplet has no contribution to the s parameter , while the contribution to the t parameter is also vanishing in the limit of @xmath28 @xcite . even if we consider the small mass splitting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) , its effect is negligibly small , such that @xmath29 \\simeq 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the weak mixing angle and @xmath31 is the @xmath32 boson mass .",
    "therefore , the constraint on the higgs boson mass ( @xmath33 ) from the precision electroweak measurements is the same as that in the sm . in our calculation",
    ", we restrict @xmath33 to be within the range of @xmath34 as estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite with the excluded region of @xmath35 reported by the tevatron @xcite .      in the model with the inert triplet scalar of @xmath36 , the @xmath4 invariant scalar potential",
    "is given by @xmath37 + \\lambda_1 |h^\\dag h|^2     + \\lambda_2 { { \\rm tr}}[t^\\dag t t^\\dag t ] + \\lambda_3 \\left ( { { \\rm tr}}[t^\\dag t ] \\right)^2    \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\lambda_4 h^\\dag h\\ { { \\rm tr}}[t^\\dag t ] + \\lambda_5 h^\\dag t t^\\dag h\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 the masses of the scalars are found to be @xmath39 it is clear that @xmath40 can be the lightest @xmath4 odd particle if @xmath41 . since dark matter must not be a charged particle , we will concentrate on @xmath41 afterward .",
    "in the model , since the masses of dark matter ( @xmath26 ) and charged components ( @xmath24 ) are almost degenerate , the coannihilation effects of @xmath42 and @xmath43 should be included in the calculation of the relic abundance of @xmath23  @xcite .     with the vertical axis of @xmath44 $ ] , where black , gray , and white regions show the parameter regions larger than , agrees with , and smaller than the wmap constraint , respectively.,width=396 ]     with the vertical axis of @xmath44 $ ] , where black , gray , and white regions show the parameter regions larger than , agrees with , and smaller than the wmap constraint , respectively.,width=207 ]    in figs .",
    "[ fig : relic_abundance ] and [ fig : relic_abundance2 ] , we show the relic abundance of @xmath23 , where we have used _ _ micromegas2.4__@xcite . for small couplings , i.e. @xmath45 , the dark matter annihilation is governed by the weak interaction .",
    "so the annihilation cross section does not decrease so much .    on the other hand , in the large coupling region ( i.e. @xmath46 ) , the main annihilation modes are higgs interactions . since the trilinear coupling of @xmath21 involves only @xmath47 , the cross sections are enhanced by @xmath48 . from the figure , we find that for @xmath49 , the relic abundance agrees with the wmap data in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmap_relic ] ) .     and nucleus particles , where numbers on lines represent the cross sections in @xmath50 unit , while the light gray region is allowed by direct searches of dark matter . , width=226 ]",
    "the si cross section of the y=0 itm is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : direct_detection ] . from the figure",
    ", we can see that in most of the region , the model escapes the constraint from the direct search .",
    "in this model , the allowed processes are the @xmath23-quark ( u , d ) scatterings at tree level with the small yukawa coupling , and @xmath23-gluon scatterings at loop level . as a result , the si cross section is clearly suppressed .       with the vertical axis of @xmath51 $ ] , where the light gray region is allowed by wmap . , width=396 ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the total relic abundance of @xmath40 and @xmath52 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : relic_abundance3 ] . note that the masses of @xmath24 and @xmath53 are automatically fixed if @xmath54 and @xmath55 are known .",
    "since the degeneracy of triplet masses is lifted at tree level , coannihilations of the triplet scalars are not so effective compared to that in the @xmath27 case .",
    "thus , the relic abundance gets enhanced . in the large @xmath56 region , as the mass degeneracy of the triplet components is lifted , the coannihilation effect becomes weaker than that in the small @xmath56 , which enhances the relic abundance .",
    "however , the annihilation cross section becomes large due to the large couplings of @xmath57 and @xmath56 , which suppresses the relic abundance more effective than the coannihilation effect .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : relic_abundance100 ] , one can see that in the small mass region , the relic abundance drastically changes due to the resonance effect as well as the opening of new annihilation final states . in the figure ,",
    "we have fixed @xmath58 . as @xmath57 approaches to @xmath56 ,",
    "the figures become similar to those with small @xmath56 since the main interactions enhanced by the large higgs coupling are proportional to @xmath59 . in the region with @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is most effective , the relic abundance is reduced . in the case of @xmath62 ,",
    "the tri - higgs couplings proportional to @xmath59 are canceled to @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the effective couplings of the higgs bosons are very weak and the relic abundance is mainly determined by gauge interactions .",
    "we comment on the direct detection of the y=2 case .",
    "unlike those in y=0 , there are additional scattering processes in the y=2 model , which are the @xmath23-quark scatterings through the gauge coupling of @xmath23 to z. they have larger cross sections due to the gauge coupling .",
    "because of these large cross sections , almost all region is excluded by the direct detection constraint in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dd_constraint ] ) .",
    "note that since the scattering process does not depend on the higgs coupling , this tendency is same even if the ratio of @xmath57 and @xmath56 changes .",
    "we have studied dark matter in the two inert triplet models and we have found that there are allowed regions which agree with the wmap result in tevscale for both models .",
    "explicitly , we have shown that in the y=0 model , the dark matter mass of the neutral scalar around @xmath64 is favored by wmap , which is also allowed by the direct detection , while in the y=2 model , @xmath65 is preferred in terms of the relic abundance , but most of the region is excluded by the direct detection constraint since the @xmath23-quark scattering cross section mediated by z enhanced the si cross section ,",
