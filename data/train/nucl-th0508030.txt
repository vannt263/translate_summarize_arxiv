    "newton - birkhoff theorem in the theory of gravitation is a very important theorem .",
    "the violation of this theorem by yukawa potential is the central ingredient in our calculation of the surface tension and the mean field of heavy nuclei .",
    "therefore , in this paper we provide a discussion of this theorem in newtonian gravity in detail .",
    "let us consider a spherically symmetric ball of mass @xmath0 , mass density @xmath1 and radius @xmath2 .",
    "+ theorem ( part - i ) : the potential due to the spherical ball at a distance @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the same as the potential due to point particle of mass @xmath0 placed at the centre of spherical ball .",
    "+ let us consider a spherical shell of outer radius @xmath2 and inner radius @xmath5 , having constant mass density @xmath1 .",
    "+ theorem ( part - ii ) : the gravitational potential due the spherical shell at any point @xmath3 , where @xmath6 is constant .",
    "therefore , the force at the point @xmath3 is zero . +",
    "this theorem also holds in general theory of relativity and is called the newton - birkhoff theorem .",
    "bellow we provide proof of the theorem in the contex of newtonian gravity .",
    "the proof reveals why the theorem is so special to newtonian gravitatinal potential and does not hold for other potentials .",
    "+ we want to calculate the gravitational potential and potential energy of a spherically symmetric ball of radius @xmath2 and constant density @xmath1.the two - body newtonian gravitational potential energy is given by , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the locations of the point masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the newtonian gravitational potential at a point @xmath8 due to a point mass @xmath12 at point @xmath9 is given by @xmath13    for a mass distribution with density @xmath14 , the formulas above take the following forms , @xmath15 @xmath16    in spherical co - ordinate system the formula for @xmath17 gives , @xmath18 in the expression above , the integral over @xmath19 ranges from @xmath20 to @xmath21 and for @xmath22 , it ranges from @xmath20 to @xmath23 .",
    "the integral over @xmath19 gives a factor of @xmath21 .",
    "the integral over @xmath22 can be carried out by making the following change of variable @xmath24    the integration over @xmath25 ranges from @xmath26 after carrying out integrations over @xmath19 and @xmath22 , we obtain @xmath27\\frac{r'}{r}dr'\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath28 , and @xmath29 @xmath30\\frac{r'}{r}dr'= -4\\pi \\frac{g\\rho}{r}\\int_{0}^{a } r'^2 dr'=-\\frac{4\\pi a^3\\rho g}{3r}= -\\frac{gm}{r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath31 , and @xmath32 @xmath33\\frac{r'}{r}dr'= -4\\pi g\\rho\\int_{b}^{r } r'dr'=-2\\pi g\\rho(r^2-b^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is constant independent of @xmath34 .",
    "note that , in the equation above , the cancellation of @xmath3 from the expression is due to the special form of the newtonian potential .",
    "since force is given by the gradient of the potential with respect to @xmath8 , @xmath35 , therefore there is no gravitational force within the spherical shell .",
    "this demostrates that in a classical theory this constant potential is dynamically irrelevant .",
    "however , it should be noted that in a quantum theory this `` constant potential well '' is relevant and its physical effects can be observed .",
    "in this section we discuss why the density of nucleons in heavy nuclei can be taken to be constant .",
    "we do not provide here a formal proof of our claim .",
    "we rather argue that it follows very natuarally from the short range character of the attractive potential , pauli s exclusion principle and the repulsive hard core potential of nucleons .",
    "our claim is essentially based on self consistency arguments . however , it is important to note that we do not require any ergodicity or thermodynamic equillibrium for the constancy of the density of nucleons in the nuclei . + in order to maintain simplicity in our exposition and to avoid complications , we consider only one type of nucleon and assume that it does not carry any electric charge .",
    "the attactive interaction potential between a pair of nucleons is given by the short range yukawa potential , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the nuclear charge ( @xmath38 is the dimensionless nuclear fine structure constant ) and @xmath39 characterizes the range of the attractive potential .",
    "we assume that @xmath40 is the radius of the core of the hard core potential .",
    "we assume that , @xmath2 , is the radius of the nucleus and @xmath41 is the number nucleons in it . at first , we consider the nuclear matter limit of the nucleus .",
    "this means that both @xmath2 and @xmath41 are large .",
    "yukawa potential is a short range potential , and therefore , each nucleon interacts with nucleons in a small neighbourhood around itself .",
    "the number of nucleons in its neighbourhood is proportional to the density of nucleons @xmath42 .",
    "let the constant of proportionality be @xmath43 .",
    "note that @xmath43 is the volume charaterising the range of the potential and can be taken to be @xmath44 .",
    "let us represent by @xmath45 the potential energy of attractive interaction between two nucleons .",
    "therefore , the potential energy of attractive interaction of a single nucleon with its neighbours is @xmath46 , and of @xmath41 nucleons with their neighbours is @xmath47 . in the next section",
    ", we will show that @xmath48 ( see the end of section - iii ) . + we assume that the kinetic energy of the nucleons in the nucleus is solely due to the zero point energy",
    ". therefore , using pauli s exclusion principle we obtain , @xmath49 . taking @xmath50 , we write the total energy @xmath51 as function of @xmath2 as , @xmath52 we look for the variational ( qm ) ground state of the system .",
    "this can be done by finding the minimum of the function e(r ) . by imposing the condition , @xmath53 , we obtain all the extrema .",
    "it turns that the function has a minimum at @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and a maximum when the interparticle distance ( @xmath56 ) is a few fermi .",
    "the function goes to zero at infinity .",
    "therefore , there is no minima for finite value of @xmath2 . such a system would either fly apart or collapse to a point .",
    "the ground state of the system is unstable .",
    "it is here that the hard core potential comes to play an important role . because of the hard core potential the collapse would stop when @xmath57",
    "therefore , @xmath58 and the per particle binding energy @xmath59 this leads to the emergence of constant density .",
    "this picture resembles very much like those in packed granular material .",
    "however , our arguments are exact only in the limit of nuclear matter . for finite nuclei",
    ", however heavy it may be , volume occupied by the nucleons will be a bit larger than the hard core radii .",
    "pauli s exclusion principle adding a soft core in addition to the already existing hard core .",
    "this soft core is not a scattering potential . because of pauli",
    "s exclusion principle , the nucleons rather avoid each other .",
    "it is a granular material in which the particle fail to touch other by the virtue of pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "but the gap is limited and this does not allow the particles to pile up at any one single place thereby mainintaining a constant density profile .",
    "we consider heavy spherical nucleus consisting of @xmath41 nucleons and of radius @xmath2 .",
    "the density of nucleons in the nucleus , @xmath42 , is considered to be constant . since the system is spherically symmetric , the potential at any point on a layer at @xmath3 will be the same .",
    "in general the potential on any layer at @xmath3 will consist of two parts- the potential due to the spherical ball of radius @xmath60 and the potential due to the spherical shell of inner radius @xmath61 and outer radius @xmath2 .",
    "we will calculate these two contributions separately and then add them up .",
    "this amounts to calculating the potential , @xmath62 , out side a spherical ball and the potential , @xmath63 , inside a spherical shell exactly in the way we carried out the calculations in newtonian gravity .",
    "let us write the general expression for the potential , @xmath64 , @xmath65    in the expression above , the integral over @xmath19 ranges from @xmath20 to @xmath21 and for @xmath22 , it ranges from @xmath20 to @xmath23 .",

    "we can estimate the value of @xmath72 by writing the series expansion of hyperbolic cosine and sine functions in the expression of @xmath72 .",
    "this gives , @xmath74}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the number of nucleons inside the spherical ball of radius @xmath69 .",
    "when radius @xmath69 is large , the quantity @xmath76 is much much larger than the total nucleon charge @xmath77 inside the spherical ball .",
    "therefore , to obtain the same potential as that of the spherical ball containing the amount of nuclear charge @xmath77 (  at distance @xmath3 , @xmath73  ) , we need to place at centre of the ball a point nucleus of nuclear charge equal to @xmath76 which is larger than @xmath77 .",
    "this clearly demostrates that the part - i of the newton - birkhoff theorem is violated by the yukawa potential.however , in the limit of @xmath78 , we recover result similar to the case of gravity . + for @xmath31 , and @xmath32 @xmath79\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after carrying out the integration , we obtain @xmath80\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath81 is the potential inside a hollow spherical shell , @xmath82 , and therefore , there is force inside a hollow spherical shell .",

    "we provide plots of the potential for three different nuclei in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the qualitative feature of this potential is similiar to the phenomenological wood - saxon potential @xcite .",
    "the qualitative features is similiar even near the boundary of the nucleus .",
    "this is a bit of a surprising result because the nucleon density near the boudary of the nucleus decreases drastically where as in our derivation we have assumed constant density through out the nucleus .",
    "this suggests that the mean field potential is not very sensitive to the distribution of nucleons near the boundary .",
    "+ from eq.(23 ) , it is now easy to infer that in the nuclear matter limit , i.e. , when @xmath2 is very large , @xmath98 . therefore , the quantity , @xmath99 introduced in section - ii is equal to @xmath100 .",
    "in this section we sketch some arguments to show that the surface tension in heavy nuclei has its orgin in the violation of newton - birkhoff theorem",
    ". actual calculation of the surface tension will require the true density profile of the nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "however , in the frame work of the present paper the density is assumed to be constant , and therefore , we will not attempt to calculate the surface tension .",
    "we rather point out that , even under the assumption of constant density , one can observe the origin of surface tension .",
    "the true density profile influences only the numerical value of the surface tension .",

    "+ the depth of the mean field potential varies very slowly in the central region ( @xmath109 ) of the nucleus ( see fig.(1 ) ) .",
    "however , near the outer surface , there is a sharp decline in the depth of the total potential .",
    "therefore , the force will have very small in magnitude ( practically zero ) in the central region but a broad peak near the bounday of the nucleus .",
    "this is what we observe in fig.(2 ) , where we have plotted the total force , @xmath103 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the direction of this force at any point @xmath3 near the boundary is towards the centre along the radius connecting the point .",
    "every nucleon in the outer shell is , therefore , radially pulled towards the centre of the nucleus . since the force is practically zero in the central part of the of the nucleus , there is a net pressure difference between the outer shell and the inner core .",
    "this is the origin of surface tension in nuclei .",
    "we believe that the surface tension in most normal liquids have similar origin .",
    "our believe is based on the fact that potentials of the type @xmath110 which describe the properties liquid state very well , can be obtained by the exchange of continuum of yukawa modes @xcite with some spectral weight @xmath111 .",
    "in fact , the most commonly used leonard - jones potential in liquids can be obtained with spectral weight @xmath112 . @xmath113",
    "in this paper , we have tried to emphasise the importance of the violation of newton - birkhoff theorem by yukawa interaction for the emergence of mean field shell model potential as well as the surface tension in heavy nuclei .",
    "the only input from the nuclear physics that we have used is the constant density profile of nucleons in heavy nuclei .",
    "some very basic and general assumptions , such as pauli s exclusion principle , short range character of the attractive yukawa potential and the existence of a repulsive hard core in nucleons , ensures the emergence of constant density profile in heavy nuclei .",
    "we have derived the mean field shell model potential analytically .",
    "this potential qualitatively agrees wtih the phenomenological wood - saxon potential .",
    "our formula explicitly shows how the mean field potential depends on pion - nucleon coupling constant , range of the two - body yukawa potential , nuclear size and the density .",
    "solution of the schroedinger equation with the mean field potential so derived leads to the emergence of shell model structure .",
    "we have also pointed out how the violation of the newton - birkhoff theorem leads to the emergence of surface tension in heavy nuclei .",
    "our derivations , although semi - quantitative in nature , strongly suggest that the qualitative features which are attributed either to shell model or liquid drop model can be derived from the yukawa interaction of nucleons having repulsive hard core , and some basic principles of quantum mechanics .",
