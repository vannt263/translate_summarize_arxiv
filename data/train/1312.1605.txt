    "in this work we study the scalar - isoscalar resonances @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 @xcite in the framework of the extended linear sigma model ( elsm ) @xcite . the elsm is built accordingly to two fundamental properties of qcd : chiral symmetry and dilatation invariance , the former being spontaneously broken by a mexican - hat potential , the latter being explicitly broken in such a way to mimic the trace anomaly of qcd @xcite . as a consequence of these two requirements ,",
    "the elsm lagrangian contains only a finite number of terms . moreover , ( axial)vector d.o.f .",
    "are included from the very beginning in the effective model .",
    "the inclusion of the latter in a chiral invariant way makes the model more complete and has a strong influence on the phenomenology .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the elsm has been first studied , both in the baryonic and mesonic sectors , in presence of two - flavours , @xmath4 the inclusion of the dilaton / glueball field for @xmath5 has been carried out in  ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that the glueball is predominantly contained in either @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( the former case being favoured ) . still , the study was not complete because scalar mesons containing the @xmath6-quark were not included .",
    "a detailed study of the elsm for three flavours , @xmath7 , has been performed in  ref .",
    "@xcite , where a very good description of various meson masses and decays was achieved .",
    "yet , the dilaton , although formally included to justify the form of the lagrangian , was inert ( i.e. , with zero width , in agreement with large-@xmath8 limit ) .",
    "the scalar - isoscalar system was studied with the nonstrange quarkonium field @xmath9 and with the hidden - strange quarkonium field @xmath10 only .",
    "@xcite shows through a fit to experimental data that these quark - antiquark states are heavy ( above 1 gev ) ; similarly , the scalar isovector and isodoublet states are identified with the heavy resonances @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively . consequently , the scalar mesons below 1 gev shall be interpreted differently : tetraquarks or molecular / dynamically generated states are the most prominent options , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and refs . therein .    in the scalar - isoscalar sector",
    "a three - body mixing problem must be solved : the three bare fields @xmath13 @xmath14 and , in addition , the dilaton @xmath15 mix and generate the physical resonances @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the aim is to determine the mixing matrix in such a way that the masses and the decays of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are in agreement with the experimental results listed in ref . @xcite .",
    "such a mixing problem was investigated in a variety of phenomenological models , see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "however , a full calculation involving a @xmath16 chiral approach has not yet been achieved for @xmath7 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the first step toward this direction has been performed , but the attention was focused on the masses only ( no decays were calculated ) . based on the parameter determination obtained in  ref .",
    "@xcite , a correct description of the masses @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 implies that the predominant glueball content is located in the resonance @xmath2 ( and not in @xmath1 ) .",
    "in this work we continue the study of this system by calculating , for the first time , the decay widths of the scalar - isoscalar states .",
    "it is shown that the mixing matrix of ref .",
    "@xcite implies too large decay widths for @xmath1 and @xmath17 and must be discarded .",
    "therefore , we search for other solutions .",
    "the system is extremely dependent on subtle issues such as constructive and destructive interference effects ; for this reason , a fit ( which is the most straightforward thing to do ) could not yet deliver acceptable results .",
    "anyhow , an interesting partial solution could be obtained by a simple ` guess and try ' procedure . in this solution",
    ", the gluon condensate is very large and the glueball is to a very good extent described by the resonance @xmath2 only .",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath2 and @xmath18 can be qualitatively described , but the kaon - kaon decay of @xmath3 is still too large .",
    "future studies will show if this novel solution is phenomenologically acceptable or not .",
    "this proceeding is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we present the effective lagrangian of the elsm , in sec . 3 we discuss the results and in sec .",
    "4 we provide a summary and an outlook for work in progress .",

    "the physical states are obtained upon diagonalization :    @xmath41    the aim is to determine the mixing matrix @xmath42 .",
    "we use the parameters determined in  ref . @xcite .",
    "these parameters allow for a correct description of a variety of vacuum properties of mesons up to 1.5 gev .",
    "however , four parameters could not be uniquely determined in ref .",
    "@xcite : these are @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in ref .",
    "[ 5 ] three of them ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath45 ) were determined in order to obtain the measured experimental masses of the resonances @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 : @xmath49-@xmath50 mev , @xmath51 mev and @xmath52 mev pdg . a solution",
    "in which @xmath1 is predominantly gluonic could not be found . on the contrary",
    ", the masses could be well described for @xmath53 gev , @xmath54 gev , and @xmath55 the resulting mixing matrix reads : @xmath56we have now tested this scenario by evaluating the decay widths ( the corresponding mathematical expressions will be presented in a forthcoming publication @xcite ) . for @xmath57 ( large-@xmath58 limit ) , one finds the decay widths into kaons and pions : @xmath59 gev , @xmath60 gev , @xmath61 gev , @xmath62 gev , @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 gev .",
    "these results are clearly _ too large _ and can not be cured by varying the only remaining free parameter @xmath46 ( which should anyhow be small ) .",
    "thus , the decay widths do not support this scenario as physical .",
    "note , such a large decay width of the predominantly glueball state is in agreement with the study of ref . @xcite .",
    "the search for an acceptable solution is extremely difficult due to interference effects in the decay amplitudes",
    ". a direct fit to the known decay widths was so far not successful .",
    "this is why we have searched a solutions by trying to guess the right area of the parameter space .",
    "first , we use as an input the bare glueball mass @xmath65 gev in agreement with lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "then , due to the fact that @xmath2 was too broad in the previous solution , we have increased the value of the dimensionful parameter @xmath27 : for @xmath66 gev the resonance @xmath67 is sufficiently narrow . by further tuning @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    "we obtain the mixing matrix    @xmath70    the resonance @xmath2 is ( almost ) a pure glueball .",
    "the masses that are determined by these parameters are acceptable : @xmath71 gev , @xmath72 mev and @xmath73 gev .",
    "the resulting decay widths are : @xmath74 gev , @xmath75 gev , @xmath76 gev , @xmath77 gev , @xmath78 gev , @xmath79 gev .",
    "thus , while the decays of @xmath0 and @xmath2 are at least in qualitative agreement with the experiment , this is not the case for @xmath3 : the decays are still too large .",
    "note also that the very large value of @xmath27 implies a large gluon condensate : lattice results @xcite suggest that @xmath80 gev , see the discussion in ref .",
    "thus , at this level this solution is not yet conclusive , but can point to an interesting direction where to look for it : large bare glueball mass in agreement with lattice ( 1.7 gev ) and a large value of the gluon condensate .",
    "in this work we have studied the masses and the decays of the resonances @xmath18 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 within the elsm .",
    "presently , the favoured glueball seems to be @xmath17 in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite , but further studies are needed .",
    "namely , decay widths which are -at least qualitatively- in agreement with data could only be found for a large ( eventually too large ! ) value of the gluon condensate .",
    "another possibility is an improvement of the underlying effective model of ref .",
    "@xcite , by studying the influence of a quadratic mass term in the ( pseudo)scalar sector .",
    "this is a minimal change of ref .",
    "@xcite , which however can have interesting phenomenological implications due to the fact that the strange current quark mass is not negligible . for value of the gluon condensate in agreement with lattice",
    ", a not too broad glueball can only be found if destructive interferences between the different amplitudes occur .",
    "this is why an improved numerical analysis , which allows to study in detail the whole parameter space , would be also helpful .",
    "more in general , one can extend the study of glueballs with other quantum numbers . in ref .",
    "@xcite the pseudoscalar glueball was investigated within the elsm .",
    "a similar program can be carried out for a tensor glueball with a mass of about 2.2 gev , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
