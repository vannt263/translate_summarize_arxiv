    "topological quantum states arising in topological insulators ( tis ) due to strong spin - orbit interaction and time reversal symmetry attract a great deal of interest because of their nontrivial properties as well as because they provide us with opportunities to explore qualitatively new physical phenomena challenging for construction of novel quantum devices , spintronic applications and topological quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the topological states are robust since they are protected against the scattering by weak non - magnetic impurities and disorders .",
    "the main attention is paid to topological states that exist near the surface of three - dimensional tis and the edge of two - dimensional ( 2d ) tis . however , unusual electron states arise also at impurities and structure defects located in the bulk .",
    "impurity induced states were studied both for impurities on the surface of three - dimensional tis  @xcite , and in 2d tis  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the impurity states were discussed for one - dimensional topological systems  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion is that the electron density localizes near the defect in a highly unusual way .",
    "a similar phenomenon can occur in a trivial one - dimensional system with spin - orbit interaction in the presence of a weak magnetic field  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we address to the 2d tis since many experiments presently indicate the important role of structural defects in these materials , especially in the electron transport .",
    "theoretical studies of bound states induced by nonmagnetic defects in the bulk of 2d tis   have revealed specific properties of these states which are inherent to 2d tis and absent in the topologically trivial crystals .",
    "it turns out that in 2d tis there are two mechanisms of the bound state formation in contrast to the trivial case where a bound state arises only as a quasiparticle ( electron or hole ) is localized in a quantum well produced by the defect . in 2d tis ,",
    "bound states are formed by the repulsive potential as well .",
    "these states are similar to the helical edge states at the boundary of the 2d ti .",
    "their distinguishing feature is that the electron density is low in the center but concentrated around the defect .",
    "correspondingly there are two kinds of the states located at the defect .",
    "in particular , a defect with strongly localized potential induces two states irrespective of the sign of its potential .",
    "this contrasts to the trivial case where the same defect produces only one state .",
    "it is worth noting that two states located at a given defect are distinguished also by their pseudospin structure . in one state ,",
    "the hole component of the spinor equals zero in the center while in the other state , the electron component turns to zero there .",
    "correspondingly the states can be classified also as the electron - like and hole - like states  @xcite .    in experiments ,",
    "the defect - induced bound states are still poorly understood though they attract continuously increasing interest , which is stimulated mainly by discrepancies between the experiments and expectations of the theory .",
    "the discrepancies are usually associated with the presence of uncontrolled defects , the density of which is apparently high under the real conditions .    in particular , the electric conductance of the edge states in experiments  @xcite appears to be smaller than the universal quantity @xmath0 predicted by the existing theories  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in many experiments  @xcite the conductance is decreased by several times or even orders of magnitude .",
    "along with this , the common observation is that the suppression of the conductance weakly depends on the temperature .",
    "these facts suggests that the conductance reduction is related to structural defects in the tis .",
    "moreover , the energy spectrum of the defect - induced states plays an important role , since the scattering of electrons in helical edge states on non - magnetic defects is possible only due to inelastic processes  @xcite , particularly due to intracenter transitions .",
    "nevertheless , present theories of spin - flip scattering on defects are based on phenomenological models of a defect ignoring its real spectrum and electronic structure  @xcite .",
    "our study is motivated by the idea that optical methods could be a promising tool for studying the unusual properties of defects in tis .",
    "such techniques are now well developed for defects in semiconductors  @xcite and are increasingly used in the studies of 2d electron systems  @xcite .",
    "the present paper aims to clarify how the defect - induced states are manifested in optical absorption spectra .",
    "we find that the defects located in the bulk of the 2d ti produce specific peaks in the absorption spectrum which can be identified experimentally .",
    "the peaks originate from electron transitions between the quantum states of different types that are located at the same defect . in one state ,",
    "a particle is captured by the attractive potential and in the other state , a particle circulates around the defect .",
    "an important factor affecting the formation of the peaks is also a specific dependence of the energy of the bound states of the defect potential .",
    "the energy of both states turns out to be weakly dependent on the amplitude of the defect potential in a wide range of the potentials .",
    "it is for this reason the light quanta absorbed by the defects with different potentials have close energies thereby forming the peak .",
    "our study of optical transitions in 2d tis with structural defects is based on the hamiltonian proposed by bernevig , hughes and zhang ( bhz )  @xcite .",
    "this model adequately describes single - particle states in the low - energy region with using four - component basis @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are superposition of electron and light - hole states with the moment projection @xmath4 , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the heavy - hole states with @xmath7 . if the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) due to structural inversion asymmetry and bulk inversion asymmetry is absent , the bhz hamiltonian is block diagonal : @xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is the momentum operator and @xmath12 are the pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath13 are model parameters depending on the quantum - well width  @xcite . of critical importance is the sign of the parameter @xmath14 that defines the ordinary and inverted - band situations : @xmath15 corresponds to the topological phase , @xmath16 is topologically trivial case .",
    "the defects are represented by a localized potential @xmath17 .",
    "we suppose that the density of the defects is not very high so that they do not interact one with other and can be considered independently .",
    "particularly , we do not consider defect clusters forming electron puddles , which are sometimes discussed in connection with the scattering of electrons in edge states . in the present paper we study optical absorption due to defects with short - range potential .",
    "this is a reasonable simplification which is justified since the dielectric constant of tis is usually high  @xciteand therefore one can expect that the long - range part of the defect potential is small .",
    "consideration of the defects with short - range potential is of considerable interest also for the reason that in this case the structure of the bound state spectrum weakly depends on the details of the potential shape and therefore one can expect the appearance of universal results .    in what follows , it is convenient to use dimensionless notations for the energy @xmath18 , the distance @xmath19 , the wave vector @xmath20 , and the potential @xmath21 . for brevity we will drop the tilde .",
    "in addition , we introduce important dimensionless parameters @xmath22 which determine the band structure of electrons in homogeneous crystal in the bhz model .",
    "parameter @xmath23 determines the asymmetry of the electron and hole bands , and the parameter @xmath24 to a large extent determines the shape of the dispersion relation in the conduction and valence bands .    in order to study the optical absorption",
    "one should calculate the matrix elements of the electron transitions between different states localized on an impurity and between the impurity states and band states .",
    "first consider the band states in absence of the soi .",
    "since the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has block - diagonal structure , the spin - up and spin - down sectors can be considered independently .",
    "the band states are characterized by the band index @xmath25 , which corresponds to the @xmath26- and @xmath27-bands , and the spin @xmath28 .",
    "the electron energy is independent of the spin .",
    "the dispersion relation in the @xmath26- and @xmath27-bands has the following form : @xmath29    the band states in the spin - up sector are presented by the following spinor : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is normalization constant .",
    "the band spectrum has the qualitatively different shape in the following three regions of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath23 . at @xmath33 ,",
    "the energy gap equals 2@xmath34 and the dispersion curves has the minimum in the @xmath26-band and the maximum in the @xmath27-band at @xmath35 . at @xmath36 ,",
    "the dispersion curve has a mexican hat shape in both bands , with the gap being smaller than 2@xmath34 . when @xmath37 , only one of the bands has a mexican hat shape .",
    "we now turn to the states bound at the defect .",
    "they are found from the schrdinger equation : @xmath38\\psi=0 $ ] .",
    "for the spin - up block we have @xmath39\\psi(\\mathbf{r})=v(r)\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 .",
    "this equation is easily solved in the case where the potential is localized in a region which is small compared with the characteristic length scale of the wave function  @xcite . using the fourier",
    "transform we arrive at a system of equations for spinor components at the defect , @xmath41 , @xmath42\\bar{\\psi}_e&=0\\\\   \\label{bse_h }   \\left[1\\!-\\!\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty}dk k v_k\\frac{\\varepsilon\\!+\\!1\\!-\\!(1\\!+\\!d_b)k^2}{\\delta(\\varepsilon , k)}\\right]\\bar{\\psi}_h&=0\\ , ,   % \\label{bse_h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the fourier transform of the potential @xmath45 @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the bessel function .",
    "the bound state energies are determined by eqs  ( [ bse_e ] ) and ( [ bse_h ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that they have solutions in two cases : + 1 .",
    "electron - like states : @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the energy of these states @xmath50 is determined by the equation @xmath51 2 .",
    "hole - like states : @xmath52 , @xmath53 with the energy @xmath54 that is determined by the equation @xmath55    in each case there is only one solution  @xcite .",
    "thus , at a given potential of the defect there are two bound states : electron - like and hole - like ones .",
    "they are described by the following wave functions : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the azimuth angle of @xmath58 , @xmath59    to analyze possible spectra of the the defect - induced optical absorption , it is important to clarify how the energy of the bound states depends on the defect potential amplitude . in the case of 2d tis , this dependence turns out to be very unusual . with",
    "increasing the potential , the energies of both the electron - like and hole - like states , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , tend to finite limiting values , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) for the potential of the form : @xmath64 .",

    "[ transitions ] .",
    "calculations were carried out for @xmath24=2 , @xmath23=0.2 , @xmath66=5 .",
    "( b ) the same as in the panel ( a ) , but with account of the soi .",
    "the soi parameter is @xmath67=0.5 . ]",
    "the analysis of the bound states in a wide range of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath23 shows that the properties of the bound states desribed above are qualitatively the same for all areas of the parameters .",
    "the only essential condition is the band structure inversion ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the existence of the electron - like and hole - like bound states in 2d tis as well as occurrence of the limiting energies was first found in our recent paper  @xcite in the frame the bhz model symmetric with respect to the electron and hole states . in this paper",
    "we generalize these results to the case of the asymmetric electron - hole band structure .",
    "it should be noted that the electron - hole asymmetry is very essential for all realistic 2d tis used in experiments .",
    "now we consider the effect of the soi , which is also present in the realistic systems .",
    "to be specific we take into account the soi arising due to both the bulk and interface inversion asymmetry , which is described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath69    we have studied this case within the same approach as above . in this case the calculations are much more cumbersome since the hamiltonian does not split into two independent blocks and therefore the equations for eigenfunctions should be used in full 4@xmath704 form .",
    "however , the results turn out to be qualitatively very similar to those shown above .",
    "therefore , we do not give the details , and present only the main results .",
    "we have found that a defect with short - range potential produces two bound states .",
    "their energies vary with the potential amplitude in the same manner as in the case without the soi .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) where specific results are presented for the same parameters @xmath24 and @xmath23 as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , but the soi is added . it is seen that the soi of rather high value ( @xmath67=0.5 ) does not qualitatively change the bound - state spectrum and its dependence on the defect potential .",
    "the main effects of the soi are as follows : + i ) the band gap decreases , but not much . in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the gap is decreased from 2 to @xmath711.77 .",
    "+ ii ) the spin state is changed .",
    "the @xmath72-component of the moment is not a quantum number .",
    "the moment deviates from the @xmath72-axis and depends on the potential amplitude .",
    "thus , the basic properties of the impurity states , which are important for our study , remain qualitatively unchanged . therefore in the following calculations we drop the soi .",
    "the optical transitions between the bound states of different types and between the bound states and the band states are studied in the electric dipole approximation .",
    "within the frame of the @xmath73-theory , the hamiltonian of a light - matter interaction for spin - up sector reads @xmath74 where @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the vector potential .",
    "specific calculations are carried out for right - hand - polarized electromagnetic field incident normally on the sample .",
    "in this section , we find out how the properties of the defect - induced states are manifested in the optical absorption spectra of 2d tis .",
    "the main features of the absorption spectrum are caused by the intracenter transitions and the unusual dependence of the bound state energies on the defect potential .",
    "first of all , we note that the transitions between the electron - like and hole - like states are allowed in the electric dipole approximations in each spin sector without changing the spin since the orbital angular momenta of these states differ by unity .",
    "this conclusion follows from the direct calculation of the matrix elements @xmath77 of the transition between @xmath78 and @xmath79 states .",
    "for example , the matrix element of the transition with the absorption of the light quantum on the defects with positive @xmath27 is expressed via the spinor components @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 as follows @xmath84 . \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] a similar equation can also be obtained for defects with @xmath85 . using eqs  ( [ psi1e])-([psi2h ] )",
    "it is easy to see that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hae ] ) is nonzero and the matrix element @xmath77 is a smooth function of @xmath27 .",
    "when calculating the probability of the optical transitions in the 2d ti , we assume that the real crystals of tis contain a variety of point defects with very different potentials .",
    "the distribution of the defect potentials is described by a function @xmath86 , which is supposed to be a smooth function going to zero at @xmath87 .",
    "we do not have actual data on the magnitude of the defect potentials in 2d tis .",
    "nevertheless , one can do some estimates taking into account that the potential is determined by the difference in the electron affinities of the defect and the host crystal .",
    "the electron affinity is usually of the order of volts while the band gap in 2d tis is typically of the order of 10  mv .",
    "therefore , we can assume that the scatter in the defect potentials far exceeds the energy gap .",
    "the rate of the transition with the absorption of photons is determined in the standard way  @xcite and has the form : @xmath88where @xmath89 is the photon energy , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the occupation probabilities of the electron - like and hole - like states .",
    "this equation can be simplified by the integration of the @xmath92-function : @xmath93_{v = v_j},\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is a root of the equation @xmath95 and the summation is over all roots @xmath94 .    in general case , eq .",

    ", the transition rate @xmath107 has the singularity of the form @xmath112 .",
    "another singularity at @xmath113 can be much more strong since the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) goes to zero as @xmath114 . however , when @xmath100 , the distribution function goes to zero .",
    "therefore the behavior of @xmath107 near the singularity point is determined by the asymptotics of the ratio @xmath115 at @xmath100 .",
