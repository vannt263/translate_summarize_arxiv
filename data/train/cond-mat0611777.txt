    "the rapid emergence of the field of spintronics ( also known as magnetoelectronics @xcite ) brought to the center of scientific research the so - called half - metallic ferromagnets ( like heusler alloys @xcite or some oxides @xcite ) .",
    "these compounds present metallic behavior for one spin - band while they are semiconducting or insulators for the other spin - band , resulting to perfect spin - polarization , at least for the bulk , at the fermi level . for realistic application ferromagnets create large stray fields and thus lead to considerable undesirable energy losses .",
    "thus , to this respect the case of half - metallic ferrimagnets is more interesting .",
    "there are several ways to create a half - metallic ferrimagnet , either by doping a semiconductor like fevsb @xcite or due to the simultaneous presence of mn and another transition - metal atom in the case of alloys with small total moment due to the small number of valence electrons ( e.g. femnsb @xcite or mn@xmath0val @xcite ) .",
    "recently akai and ogura have proposed another route to fully - compensated half - metallic ferrimagnetism based on the doping of diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite .    except heusler and oxides , also transition - metal chalcogenides like cras and pnictides like crse",
    "are known to present half - metallic ferromagnetism when they crystallize in the metastable zinc - blende structure .",
    "the first experimental evidence was provided in the case of cras thin - films by the group of akinaga in 2000 @xcite and many more experiments have confirmed these results @xcite .",
    "experiments agree with prediction of ab - initio calculations performed by several groups @xcite . in the case of the half - metallic ferromagnets like cras or crse",
    ", the gap in the minority - spin band arises from the hybridization between the p - states of the @xmath1 atom and the triple - degenerated @xmath2 states of the transition - metal and as a result the total spin - moment , @xmath3 , follows the slater - pauling ( sp ) behavior being equal in @xmath4 to @xmath5 where @xmath6 the total number of valence electrons in the unit cell @xcite .",
    "recently theoretical works have appeared attacking also some crucial aspects of these alloys like the exchange bias in ferro-/antiferromagnetic interfaces @xcite , the stability of the zinc - blende structure @xcite , the dynamical correlations @xcite , the interfaces with semiconductors @xcite , the exchange interaction @xcite and the temperature effects @xcite .    in a recent publication @xcite",
    ", we have investigated the properties of several compounds ( cras , crsb , crse , crte , vas and mnas ) when we create an excess of the transition metal atoms ; transition metal atoms occupy also antisites occupied in the perfect compound by the @xmath1 atom . to perform this study we used the full  potential nonorthogonal local  orbital minimum  basis band structure scheme ( fplo ) and we simulated disorder via the coherent potential approximation @xcite ; we also used the theoretical equilibrium lattice constants for which the perfect compounds are half - metallic ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "the most interesting case was the cr - based compounds .",
    "the cr - impurities in the case of antisites at the sublattice occupied by the @xmath1 atoms couple antiferromagnetically to the existing cr atoms at the ideal sites and destroy ferromagnetism .",
    "but these compounds stay half - metallic for large concentration of antisites exhibiting half - metallic ferrimagnetism .",
    "also in v@xmath7as@xmath8 compound the v atoms at the antisites couple antiferromagentically to the v atoms at the perfect sites but the exchange splitting of the v impurities is small and the fermi level cross the states of these atoms . in this manuscript",
    "we expand this study to cover also the case where at the antisites we find transition metal atoms of different chemical type than the perfect sites .",
    "more precisely we studied the case of mn impurites in cr[as@xmath9mn@xmath10 and cr[se@xmath9mn@xmath10 and the case of cr and mn impurities in v[as@xmath9cr@xmath10 and v[as@xmath9mn@xmath10 compounds .",
    "we find that in the case of cr - compounds the half - metallic ferrimagnetic behavior is again present , and the same is also true for the v[as@xmath9(cr or mn)@xmath10 compounds since cr and mn atoms couple antiferomagnetically to the v atoms at the perfect site and have a larger exchange splitting than the v impurities in v@xmath7as@xmath8 .     for the studied t[z@xmath8t@xmath11 $ ] compounds.[fig1 ] ]",
    "before going in details of the density of states ( dos ) or atomic spin moments we will present our results on the total spin moments . in figure [ fig1 ] we have included the different cases under study going up to x=0.5 where half of the @xmath1 atoms have been substituted by transition metal atoms . of course such",
    "a case is unlikely to be stable in the zinc - blende structure but we have gone so far to make physics more transparent.the perfect cras compound has a total spin moment in the unit cell of 3 @xmath4 since there are 11 valence electrons , crse with one valence electron more in the unit cell has a spin moment of 4 @xmath4 and vas with 10 valence electrons a spin moment of 2 @xmath4 . in all cases the total spin moment decreases with the concentration , a clear sign of the antiferromagnetic coupling between the transition metal atoms at different sites . in the case of cras , substituting cr or mn for as results to identical behavior ( solid black lines with open diamonds and stars , respectively in the figure ) and the total spin moment is almost independent of the chemical type of the transition - metal atom at the antisite .",
    "this is also true to a lesser extent for crse ( red open triangles for cr[se@xmath8cr@xmath10 and blue triangles for cr[se@xmath8mn@xmath10 ) .",
    "for the same concentration x the compound with mn has a slightly larger total spin moment and as the concentration increases this difference also increases .    in the case of vas",
    "the differences are more pronounced .",
    "when we substitute v for as , v[as@xmath8v@xmath10 , the v atoms at the ideal and the antisites are antiferromagnetically coupled .",
    "as the concentration increases the absolute value of the v spin moments decreases and for x=0.5 the total spin moment is almost zero and the v atoms are almost non - magnetic . cr and mn impurities , on the other hand , lead to larger total spin moment and the resulting compounds are ferrimagnets with strong magnetic elements .",
    "overall the v[as@xmath8mn@xmath10 compounds have a larger spin moment than the v[as@xmath8cr@xmath10 ones .",
    "we should note that although the behavior of the total spin moments reveals the existence of ferrimagnetism it does not give any information about the half - metallic character and we should look how the dos changes with the concentration @xmath12 for every case to be sure if the half - metallicity is preserved or lost .",
    ".total and atom - resolved spin magnetic moments for the cr[z@xmath8y@xmath13 compounds where z= as or se and y= cr or mn . as `` imp ''",
    "we denote the transition - metal atoms which are located at antisite positions .",
    "note that the atomic moments have been scaled to one atom .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]    we still have not discussed the behavior of the impurity atoms in the case of vas . from the table [ table2 ]",
    "it is obvious that , contrary to cr - based compounds , the impurity cr or mn atoms have a spin magnetic moment of around -2 @xmath4 , while the v impurity atoms ( see table 1 in reference @xcite ) have a spin moment of around -1 @xmath4 . to understand this behavior we have to look at the atom - resolved dos in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the exchange splitting of the v impurities at the antisites is very small and the majority ( spin - down ) and minority ( spin - up ) double degenerated @xmath14-states are completely occupied ( peaks with the higher intensity located around -1 ev ) . also one of the minority and two of the majority triple - degenerated @xmath2 states are occupied resulting in a spin moment of around -1 @xmath4 and the fermi level is crossing the spin - down band of the @xmath2 states . for cr and mn impurities",
    "the exchange splitting is larger and all three majority ( spin - down ) @xmath2-states are occupied while the picture for the minority states does not change and consecutively the spin moment of the impurity is around -2 @xmath4 .",
    "also this results to a spin - down gap separating the fully occupied d - states from the antibonding states lying higher in energy and thus to half - metallic ferrimagnetism .",
    "the exchange splitting is larger for mn than cr and the spin - down gap is larger in the former case .",
    "as we change the concentration of the impurity atoms their spin moment only slightly changes due to the stronger hybridization with the v atoms at the ideal sites .",
    "finally we should note that as we decrease the number of valence electrons and pass from crse to cras and then to vas the ionicity of the compounds becomes smaller and so do the gaps created by the impurity atoms ( smaller exchanged splitting for the same impurity atom when it is found in environment with smaller ionicity ) .",
    "we have complemented our study presented in a recent publication [ galanakis i et al 2006 _ phys .",
    "rev b _ * 74 * 140408(r ) ] where we have shown that in the case of cras and related transition - metal chalcogenides and pnictides , crystallizing in the zinc - blende structure , the excess of the transition - metal atoms leads to half - metallic ferrimagnetism . in this contribution",
    "we show that there may be additional advantages when the excess of the transition - metal atom is not of the same chemical type as the one at the perfect lattice sites . in cras and crse",
    ", the creation of mn antisites keeps the half - metallic character and the mn impurities are antiferromagnetically coupled to the cr ones leading to half - metallic ferrimagnetism .",
    "the larger exchange splitting of the mn atoms with respect to the cr ones makes the half - metallic ferrimagnetism even more robust since the gap - width is larger with respect to the case of cr antisites . even in vas , which looses its half - metallic character upon creation of v antisites , the appearance of cr or mn antisites",
    "is accompanied with the appearance of half - metallic ferrimagnetism .",
    "these results may suggest a new way to achieve stable half - metallic ferrimagnets , which is crucial for spintronic applications with respect to half - metallic ferromagnets due to the lower stray fields created by these materials .",
