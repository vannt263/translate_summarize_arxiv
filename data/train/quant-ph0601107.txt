    "any theory based on classical concepts , such as locality and realism , predicts bounds on the correlations between measurement outcomes obtained in space - separation @xcite .",

    "here , we present a tool which allows one to extend the class of non - classical states , and gives further evidence that there may exist many - particle entangled states whose correlations admit a local realistic description .    despite their fundamental role , with the emergence of quantum information @xcite",

    "quantum advantages of certain protocols , like quantum cryptography @xcite or quantum communication complexity @xcite , are linked with bell inequalities .",
    "thus , new inequalities lead to new schemes . as an example , we present communication complexity problem associated with the new multisetting inequality .",
    "specifically , based on a geometrical argument by ukowski @xcite , a bell inequality for many observers , each choosing between arbitrary number of dichotomic observables , is derived .",
    "many previously known inequalities are special cases of this new inequality , e.g. clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequality @xcite or tight two - setting inequalities @xcite . the new inequalities are maximally violated by the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite .",
    "many other states violate them , including the states which satisfy two - settings inequalities @xcite and bound entangled states @xcite .",
    "this is shown using the necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of the inequalities . finally , it is proven that the bell operator has only two non - vanishing eigenvalues which correspond to the ghz states , and thus has a very simple form .",
    "this form is utilized to show that quantum states with positive partial transposes @xcite with respect to all subsystems ( in general the necessary but not sufficient condition for entanglement @xcite ) do not violate the new inequalities .",
    "this is further supporting evidence for a conjecture by peres that positivity of partial transposes could lead us to the existence of a local realistic model @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the multisetting inequality . in section",
    "iii the necessary and sufficient condition for a violation of the inequality is derived , and examples of non - classical states are given .",

    "the quantum prediction for the bell expression ( [ general_bell ] ) is given by a scalar product of @xmath16 .",

    "one can decompose a complex number given by the sum in ( [ re_angles ] ) into its modulus @xmath40 , and phase @xmath41 : @xmath42 we maximize the length of this vector on the complex plane .",

    "finally , the maximal length reads : @xmath52 where the modulus is no longer needed since the argument of sine is small .",
    "moreover , since the local results for each party can be chosen independently , the maximal length @xmath53 does not depend on particular @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath55 is a positive real number its @xmath0th power can be put to multiply the real part in ( [ re_angles ] ) , and one finds @xmath9 to be bounded by : @xmath56^{-n } \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ !",

    "moreover , in the decomposition of @xmath103 only the products of the same trigonometric functions appear . in order to contribute to the trace",
    "they must be multiplied by again the same functions .",
    "since the decompositions of cosines of sums only differ in angles ( primed or unprimed ) and not in the individual trigonometric functions , the only contributing terms come from the product of exactly the same individual trigonometric functions in the decomposition of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",

    "<S> based on a geometrical argument introduced by ukowski , a new multisetting bell inequality is derived , for the scenario in which many parties make measurements on two - level systems . </S>",
    "<S> this generalizes and unifies some previous results . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of this inequality is presented . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the class of non - separable states which do not admit local realistic description is extended when compared to the two - setting inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> however , supporting the conjecture of peres , quantum states with positive partial transposes with respect to all subsystems do not violate the inequality . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we follow a general link between bell inequalities and communication complexity problems , and present a quantum protocol linked with the inequality , which outperforms the best classical protocol . </S>"
