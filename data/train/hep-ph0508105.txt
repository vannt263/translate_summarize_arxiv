    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions had been quite successful in describing the experimental data up to recent past . however , there are now some indications of possible inconsistencies between this model and experiment . in order to improve our understanding of what lies beyond the sm",
    ", we need to make progress on two fronts : 1 ) improve the accuracy of the experimental data 2 ) reduce the uncertainties in the theoretical predictions of the physical observables based on the sm .",
    "the hope is to find the deviations from the sm on as many front as possible so that to be able to rule in or out the various scenarios for the new physics .",
    "one of the main sources of theoretical error in making predictions involving hadrons is the nonperturbative nature of the strong interactions . since the weak interactions involving quarks is one of the main venues to test the sm , it is quite essential to be able to deal with this issue . due to confinement ,",
    "the physical states that appear in the matrix element of the quark weak currents are hadrons , which are bound states of quarks , rather than free quarks themselves .",
    "the form factors that parameterize these matrix elements characterize our lack of knowledge of the strong force in the nonperturbative regime and can not be evaluated analytically from first principles . however , with the help of the fast computers , lattice qcd has been able to make significant progress in numerical calculation of some of the nonperturbative parameters . nonetheless , to reduce the theoretical uncertainly , one solution for the time being is to look for observables which are not too sensitive to form factors and other nonperturbative parameters .    the other criteria for an interesting process for testing the sm is the sensitivity to new physics .",
    "usually , one looks for a process which receives vanishingly small contribution from the sm and therefore , any significant deviation from zero in the experimental measurement could be attributed to the new physics beyond the sm . on the other hand ,",
    "experimental confirmation of the null result to a good precision should rule out a good number of new physics scenarios if the process satisfies the above criteria .",
    "the radiative inclusive decay @xmath2 , which is due to the underlying flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) quark transition @xmath3 , and its exclusive mode @xmath4 have proven to be quite important processes for examining the sm and new physics since they were first observed by cleo .",
    "the most recent experimental data on these transitions are as follows@xcite : @xmath5 the current pdg average for the inclusive mode from cleo and the belle measurements is@xcite @xmath6    this radiative transition is dominated by the one - loop quantum effect in sm which in effective hamiltonian language is represented by the magnetic dipole operator as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "[ f1 ] ]    since the exotic particles that appear in various extensions of the sm can appear as quantum fluctuations in the loop , this rare b decay has been at the focus of many theoretical investigations to constrain different new physics scenarios .",
    "the inclusive decay , though easier to handle theoretically , is much more difficult to be accurately measured . to leading order in @xmath7",
    ", one can equate the @xmath2 equal to the underlying quark transition @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "the systematic approach to decays at energies much below the @xmath8-boson mass , like b - meson decays , is through the effective hamiltonian . here",
    "the heavy fields , like @xmath8 and top - quark fields , are integrated out of the electroweak lagrangian and the effective hamiltonian is written in terms of a series of operators with increasing mass dimensions . of course , practically , only the lowest and next - to - lowest mass dimension operators contribute to the transitions .",
    "these operators are listed as follows :    * current - current operators : @xmath9 * qcd penguin operators : @xmath10 * electroweak penguin operators : @xmath11 * electro- and chromo - magnetic operators : @xmath12    in the above equations @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the projection operators . as mentioned above , @xmath15 has the main contribution to the @xmath3 transition in the leading order . at the next - to - leading order in @xmath7 , besides the electromagnetic penguin operator , the current - current operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) and the chromomagnetic penguin operator @xmath18(fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) contribute as well .",
    "current - current operators contribution to @xmath19 .",
    "cross marks are the alternative locations for the coupling of the emitted photon .",
    "[ f2 ] ]     chromomagnetic penguin operator contribution to @xmath19 .",
    "cross mark is the alternative location for the coupling of the emitted photon.[f3 ] ]    this leads to the sm prediction of @xmath20 and consequently provides constraints on the new physics beyond the sm.@xcite .",
    "the exclusive @xmath4 decay is more difficult to calculate theoretically due to the nonperturbative nature of the hadronic matrix element of the above operators .",
    "these matrix elements are parameterized in terms of a number of form factors .",
    "one could use certain approximate symmetries of the qcd , like heavy quark symmetry , to reduce the number of these parameters .",
    "but in any case , the calculation of these parameters introduces model dependence and theoretical uncertainty in our predictions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a model independent approach based on qcd factorization in the leading power of @xmath21 has been proposed . here",
    ", the operators that were mentioned previously in connection to the inclusive decay contribute to the factorizable term to the leading ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) and next - to - leading order in @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) . on the other hand , there are new operators involving the light quark in the b meson that contribute to the nonfactorizable term as illustrated in fig .",
    "also , there are annihilation diagrams contributing to the nonfactorizable decay of the charged b mesons ( fig . [ f7 ] ) , however these transitions are ckm as well as power ( @xmath21 ) suppressed .",

    "cross mark is the alternative location for the coupling of the emitted photon.[f6 ] ]     decay.[f7 ] ]    the nonperturbative qcd enters through a number of universal functions , a form factor for @xmath22 transition and light - cone distribution amplitudes for @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons . in fact , due to the sensitivity of the branching ratio to the flavor of the light quark through the nonfactorizable terms in the ones depicted in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , one obtains a slightly different branching ratio for neutral and charged b mesons . taking the appropriate value for the input parameters , authors in ref .",
    "@xcite obtain @xmath25 as compared to @xmath26 .",
    "besides the branching ratio , one could associate another observable , the isospin symmetry breaking , to the radiative @xmath4 decay .",
    "this asymmetry is define as follows : @xmath27 with @xmath28 obtained from eq.([isospinasym ] ) by using the charge conjugate modes .",
    "@xmath29 could prove to be important observables for examining the sm as well as discriminating between various new physics scenarios@xcite .",
    "the data from belle@xcite and babar@xcite point to isospin asymmetries of at most a few percent and consistent with zero within the experimental error : @xmath30 where the last error in eq.([babar ] ) is due to the uncertainty in the ratio of the branching fractions of the neutral and charged b meson production in @xmath31 decays . as we noticed in the previous section ,",
    "this asymmetry in the sm is due to the non - spectator contributions and has been estimated within the qcd factorization approach in refs . @xcite and @xcite and the perturbative qcd method in ref .",
    "@xcite . in general , to the lowest order in @xmath7 and the small parameter @xmath21 , current - current , qcd penguin and chromomagnetic penguin operators make the dominant contributions to the isospin symmetry breaking within the sm .",
    "the role of the electroweak penguin operators are more or less the same as their qcd counterparts , however , since their corresponding wilson coefficients are significantly smaller , they can be safely ignored .",
    "the more accurate measurement of the isospin asymmetry in the near future and a better understanding of the sm prediction for this observable should provide a sensitive testing venue for possible models of new physics .",
    "one such model is the extension of the sm with an extra generation of iso - singlet quarks@xcite which is explained in the next section .",
    "in this model , the gauge structure of the sm remains intact except for an additional pair of iso - singlet quarks , which we denote them by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the difference between these new quarks and ordinary quarks of the three sm generations is that , unlike the latter ones , both left- and right - handed components of the former quarks are @xmath34 singlets .",
    "therefore , the dirac mass terms of vector - like quarks , i.e. @xmath35 are invariant under electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "however , the masses of the ordinary quarks arise from their gauge invariant yukawa couplings to an iso - doublet scalar higgs field @xmath36 as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is covering the three generations of the regular quarks , and the doublet of fermions @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 at the same time , additional @xmath34 invariant yukawa couplings between vector - like and ordinary quarks , in the form @xmath41 leads to mixing among 4 up- and down - type quarks of the same charge . as a result , after spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking due to @xmath42 , we obtain the following mass terms : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 being @xmath46 mass matrices and @xmath47 cover ordinary and vector - like quarks . in general , the mass matrices are not diagonal and unitary transformations from weak to mass eigenstates are necessary to achieve diagonalization . denoting the mass eigenstates with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 where the unitary transformation matrices @xmath51 are chosen such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are diagonal .",
    "the interesting property of the vqm is that the transformations ( 6 ) lead to inter - generational mixing among quarks not only in the charged current sector but also in the neutral current interactions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the extra iso - singlet quarks carry zero weak isospin and thus , are not involved in @xmath34 interactions as weak eigenstates .",
    "for example , the charge current interaction term @xmath54 transforms to @xmath55 where @xmath56 when expressed in terms of mass eigenstates via eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) .",
    "@xmath57 is the @xmath46 generalization of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm)@xcite quark mixing matrix .",
    "the fact that the fourth generation is iso - singlet , i.e. @xmath58 , leads to non - unitarity of the mixing matrix @xmath57 as demonstrated in the following : @xmath59}^*{({a^u_l}^{j\\delta})}^*{a^d_l}^{j\\beta } \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\sum_{i , j=1}^3{({a^d_l}^{i\\alpha})}^*{a^d_l}^{j\\beta}\\sum_{\\delta = 1}^4{({a^u_l}^{j\\delta})}^ * { a^u_l}^{i\\delta } \\\\ & = & \\sum_{i=1}^3{({a^d_l}^{i\\alpha})}^*{a^d_l}^{i\\beta}=\\delta^{\\alpha\\beta}-{({a_l^d}^{4\\alpha})}^*{a_l^d}^{4\\beta}\\;\\ ; .\\label{unitary1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in obtaining the last line in ( [ unitary1 ] ) , the unitarity of the tranformation matrix @xmath60 has been utilized . in the same way , one can show @xmath61 equations ( [ unitary1 ] ) and ( [ unitary2 ] ) , together with the unitarity of @xmath62 , indicate that the quark mixing matrix @xmath57 _ can not _ be unitary .",
    "this property of the vqm has interesting consequences in the neutral current sector where non - vanishing tree level fcnc , proportional to the deviation of the quark mixing matrix ( eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) ) from unitarity , are generated . to demonstrate this explicitly ,",
    "let us examine the neutral current which is coupled to @xmath63 boson @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the electric charge of the quark @xmath66 . the first term in ( [ ncurr ] ) is proportional to @xmath67 , the third component of the isospin , which has the value @xmath68 or @xmath69 for the up- or down - type quarks , respectively .",
    "consequently , the iso - singlet quarks , which have zero isospin , _ do not _ contribute to this term . as a result , under the transformations ( [ trans ] ) , the neutral current ( [ ncurr ] ) can be expressed in terms of the mass eigenstates as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 we observe that the non - unitarity of the mixing matrix @xmath57 in the vqm leads to the tree level fcnc in the @xmath72 sector .",
    "this in turn results in additional contributions to the isospin symmetry breaking .",
    "in fact , in the following section , we show that the isospin asymmetry in @xmath4 transitions offers an excellent physical observable for constraining the parameters of the vqm .",
    "as is shown in our result , the advantage here is that this asymmetry , unlike the branching ratio for @xmath4 for example , is sensitive to only one model parameter , namely the non - unitarity parameter @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , isospin asymmetry can provide a good constraint on the size of the fcnc in the context of vqm irrespective of the masses of the additional quarks .",
    "the non - vanishing fcnc at the tree level leads to an additional contributing feynmann diagram of fig .",
    "[ f8 ] . the amplitude for @xmath74 via @xmath75 exchange in vqm",
    "can be written as@xcite : @xmath76\\;\\ ; , \\label{vqmamp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is a measure of the non - unitarity of the extended quark mixing matrix as derived in eq .",
    "one can then write ( [ vqmamp ] ) in terms of the effective operators @xmath78 and @xmath79 and therefore the presence of the extra vector quarks is summarized in some additional terms in the wilson coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath81 to the leading order in the strong coupling @xmath7 . @xmath82 with the upper bound @xmath83 coming from the rare b decays @xcite , the additional contribution due to the tree level fcnc could be comparable to the sm value of these coefficients at @xmath84 , i.e. @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    here an explanation is in order . strictly speaking , one should include these extra terms , which are proportional to the electric charge of the light quark , in the electroweak penguin operators @xmath87@xcite .",
    "however , since , as far as isospin symmetry breaking to the leading order of @xmath7 is concerned , one can ignore these operators within sm , we prefer to write the additional vqm - generated contributions in terms of the dominant qcd penguin operators . in any case , our result does not change had we followed the strict formulation of the problem .    following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , the nonspectator isospin symmetry breaking contribution can be written as @xmath88 , with @xmath89 being the flavor of the light anti - quark in the b meson .",
    "@xmath90 is the leading isospin symmetry conserving spectator amplitude . as mentioned in the introduction , to the leading order in the strong coupling constant @xmath7 ,",
    "the main contribution to @xmath4 is from the electromagnetic penguin operator @xmath15 and the factorizable amplitude @xmath90 is proportional to the form factor @xmath91 which parameterizes the hadronic matrix element of this operator to the leading order in @xmath92 .",
