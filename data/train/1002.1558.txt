    "[ sec : simul ] we show that only germs of the pip2-rich phase larger than a treshold radius @xmath13 actually survive and grow .",

    "therefore , we are faced with the following physical picture : if elastic forces due to high membrane curvature in the region of cell convergence ( cellular vertex ) trigger disruption of cadherin links in a region of size larger than @xmath13 , the pip2-rich patch grows favoring further breaking of cadherin links ( fig .",
