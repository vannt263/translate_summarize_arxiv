    "the prevailing picture of galaxy formation was formulated almost 30 years ago by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "gas falls into the potential wells of hierarchically growing dark matter structures and is additionally governed by dissipational processes .",
    "the idea of dark matter halos acquiring angular momentum through tidal torques from surrounding large scale structure was first developed by @xcite and @xcite and later quantified by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it results in slowly rotating dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "the gas within the halo acquires the same specific angular momentum , but it can cool , therefore collapses and , under of conservation of angular momentum , forms disks @xcite .",
    "stars are formed due to the fragmentation of the gas disks , and spheroids are formed during the interaction and merging of disks @xcite .",
    "the detailed interaction of gas , stars and related physical processes make this a very complex problem , which needs to be addressed through numerical simulations .",
    "this is a twofold challenge .",
    "the first challenge is posed by the large dynamic range of scales which are encountered , from the tens of mpc scales of halo and galaxy interaction during assembly to the sub - pc scales of star formation .",
    "the second challenge stems from physical processes like star formation and feedback , which happen on scales below the resolution of most present day cosmological simulations .",
    "it is thus not so surprising that , despite many efforts in the past years , disk galaxies with realistic properties remain elusive in simulated universes .",
    "especially bulge - less disks , which have been shown to exist in non - negligible numbers @xcite in the nearby universe , have not been produced in a simulation up to this point .",
    "one of the major problems encountered in numerical simulations of disk formation is the so called angular momentum catastrophe @xcite .",
    "early simulations all resulted in small , highly centrally concentrated disks with dominating bulges ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) after loosing large amounts of angular momentum during the formation .",
    "as four main causes have been proposed : ( 1 ) lack of resolution @xcite ; ( 2 ) an artificial transfer of angular momentum from the cold disk at the interface to the hot halo @xcite ; ( 3 ) disk instabilities leading to fragmentation @xcite ; ( 4 ) merging of substructure leading to transfer of angular momentum to the outer halo via dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "the second and third effect can be avoided with an improved implementation of gas physics ( a decoupling of hot and cold gas phases for the second effect as suggested by @xcite or a multiphase medium for the third effect according to @xcite ) .",
    "low numerical resolution , the first effect , can cause artificial loss of angular momentum through a variety of effects like numerical two - body heating due to the large mass difference between dark matter and gas particles @xcite , artificial viscosity , an incorrect pressure estimate in the standard sph method for particles with significant temperature differences ( as happens for example at the edge of the disk ) , and an artificial asymmetry of the disk causing gravitational torques from the surrounding halo .",
    "these problems can be remedied with larger numbers of particles in the disk .",
    "others , like a correct modeling of the disk center where velocity gradients are steep and angular momentum is easily lost , or the formation of bars , which can transport angular momentum outward efficiently , are difficult to address even with very large particle numbers . while these effects have been demonstrated to operate in well established disks and smooth collapse scenarios @xcite , it still needs to be demonstrated to what extend they are responsible for the angular momentum loss seen in fully cosmological large scale structure simulations .    as opposed to the first three effects , the fourth , merging of substructure , is a physical effect which is natural to @xmath0cdm .",
    "it affects dark matter as well as gas , and angular momentum is lost through dynamical friction of interacting and merging clumps .",
    "the most efficient mechanism to prevent angular momentum loss through this process is to prevent the formation of too many clumps .",
    "for this , two scenarios have been discussed .",
    "the first one involves a change in the cosmological model from cold to warm dark matter ( wdm ) .",
    "while leaving the large scales untouched , this results in a smoothing of small scales of the power spectrum , and therefore less substructure and a smoother accretion of baryons onto dark matter halos instead of dense clumps susceptible to dynamical friction . @xcite successfully showed that this leads to an alleviation of the angular momentum problem , which puts doubt on the claim that the angular momentum problem is mainly a resolution issue .",
    "it can also help to solve what is known as the `` missing satellite problem '' in @xmath0cdm , a large excess in dark matter substructure predicted by numerical simulations compared to observed numbers of satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , observational constraints on the mass of dark matter particles , for example by the redshift of re - ionization ( which is delayed significantly in a wdm universe due to the lack of low mass halos ) , already allow only varieties which are tepid at most @xcite .",
    "in the second scenario preventing the gas from forming small , dense clumps before entering the main halo , the thermal energy of the gas is increased via physical processes like feedback from supernova explosions or stellar winds .",
    "we will address this in the second part of this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the role of resolution and feedback with respect to the angular momentum problem in numerical simulations of disk galaxy formation .",
    "we present a detailed , systematic study of resolution effects in isolated but semi - cosmological halos preserving the essence of the hierarchical formation history , and also test the results in fully cosmological runs .",
    "the study also covers the effects of various physical processes ranging from simulations including only radiative cooling over the inclusion of simple star formation to the application of a model for supernova feedback .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in @xmath12 we describe the code and the initial conditions we use .",
    "in @xmath13 we present the results on the angular momentum problem in simulations including only gravity and radiative cooling .",
    "@xmath14 discusses the impact of star formation and the feedback model and in @xmath15 we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "all simulations are based on the wmap3 cosmology @xcite with h@xmath2=73 km s@xmath3mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 , n@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we use the n - body code gadget2 @xcite in a version including radiative cooling based on @xcite . to minimize the number of free parameters",
    "we do not include a uv background .",
    "the gas is treated within the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) framework ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the following ,",
    "we explain our implementation of star formation and supernova feedback .",
    "our basic star formation model follows @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main criteria for either spawning a new star particle from a gas particle or turning the gas particle into a star particle ( depending on the gas mass ) are : + ( 1 ) @xmath9 , where we choosek ) where the jeans instability criterion ( sound crossing time is larger than the dynamical time ) is almost always fulfilled @xcite . ]",

    "we generally use @xmath20=2 to prevent too much increase in the number of particles .",
    "we include the most basic but also probably most influential type of stellar feedback : energy output from the late stages of the evolution of massive stars ( m@xmath218 @xmath22 ) .",
    "this is usually referred to as supernova feedback , but actually covers all types of energetic feedback which are not resolved in this study .",
    "the model implemented here showed the best performance in a more extensive study of feedback models which is presented in @xcite .",
    "as in all n - body simulations , each `` star particle '' represents a whole population of stars of total mass @xmath23 ( which depends on resolution ) . for this we assume a miller - scalo initial mass function ( imf ) ( imf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a lower cutoff of 0.1 m@xmath24 and an upper cutoff of 100 m@xmath24 : @xmath25 where a=0.284350751 and @xmath26 is the mass of the stellar population , in our case of the star particle .",
    "stars with masses between 8 and 100 m@xmath24 explode as type ii supernova and each explosion is assumed to yield an energy of 10@xmath27 ergs .",
    "this corresponds to an energy of 1.21@xmath28 erg per solar mass formed . to avoid numerical artefacts related to abrupt changes in the thermal properties of the gas which can not be resolved ,",
    "the energy is returned to the surrounding gas over time following an exponential approach using @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the total supernova energy , @xmath31 is the time when the star particle was created and @xmath32 is a typical time scale ( we use 20 myr as the lifetime of a 8  @xmath22 star ) .",
    "this energy is smoothed over the neighboring gas particles using the sph smoothing kernel , so each neighbor gets an energy of @xmath33 @xmath34 is the smoothing length and the most important parameter here .",
    "this is a variable length scale calculated similar to the gas smoothing length in gadget2 ( the mass within the smoothing sphere is kept constant ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that supernova feedback energy is radiated away very quickly in the simulations , since star formation by definition occurs in dense regions with short cooling times .",
    "consequently , in these early simulations , feedback had little impact . in more realistic ism models",
    "this does not happen due to the multiphase nature of the gas , but it is computationally demanding , if at all possible , to achieve enough resolution to directly simulate this .",
    "one method to prevent this immediate re - radiation was suggested by @xcite and later @xcite .",
    "it involves turning off radiative cooling in gas particles receiving feedback energy and evolving them adiabatically for a given time .",
    "we adopt this method and turn off the cooling locally for a time of 20 myr ( in agreement with earlier simulations and similar to the lifetime of a supernova shell ) .",
    "it is our goal to isolate the root cause of and find a solution for the angular momentum problem . in a fully cosmological simulation",
    ", this is difficult , since the resolution for a given halo and particularly for the forming galaxy is limited and the hierarchical merging processes are likely to destroy disk progenitors .",
    "therefore we first perform a controlled experiment for an isolated halo , and then verify our conclusions in a cosmological box . however , a completely isolated and idealized setup consisting of an nfw halo , quantified by @xcite . ] in combination with a hot gas halo , as in @xcite , is too artificial to probe the relevant physics , since it completely lacks any merging in the formation process . to be more realistic with the same benefits of high resolution in the gas disk and no major mergers destroying it",
    ", we use a semi - cosmological setup as in @xcite .",
    "we start with a cosmological box with a side length of 2 h@xmath3mpc , large enough to host one milky way - type halo , but lacking all large scale structure .",
    "centering the forming halo , we cut out a sphere with 1 h@xmath3mpc radius which is simulated in physical coordinates and with vacuum boundary conditions . to mimic the missing large scale effects",
    ", we apply an overdensity of @xmath35 and put the sphere into solid body rotation with a spin parameter of @xmath36 .",
    "this is higher than what is typical for dark matter halos ( @xmath37 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but will ensure the formation of a large rotationally supported and stable gas disk .",
    "we include gas particles by splitting each dark matter particle into a gas and a dark matter particle with the mass ratio given by the density parameters .",
    "the initial redshift of the simulations is z=75 . for our resolution study",
    ", we create the same initial conditions with four different resolutions , based on boxes with 16@xmath38 , 32@xmath38 , 64@xmath38 and 128@xmath38 dark matter particles .",
    "this corresponds to spheres with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 particles each in gas and dark matter .",
    "we use a gravitational softening growing proportional to the scale factor for z@xmath2110 and staying fixed in physical coordinates after z=10 , at a value of 1h@xmath3kpc for the 3 lower resolutions and 0.25 h@xmath3kpc for the highest resolution , for both gas and dark matter particles .",
    "we also tested higher softenings for the two lowest resolutions - 4 kpc h@xmath3 for 16@xmath38 and 2 kpc h@xmath3 for 32@xmath38 , which is in better agreement with the criterion derived by @xcite .",
    "however , the results for these runs do not differ significantly from those with smaller softening length , so they are not presented here .      from a cosmological 64@xmath38  h@xmath3mpc box we resimulate a halo promising to host a milky way - type galaxy .",
    "the crucial selection features are the halo mass ( @xmath43 ) , a relatively quiet merging history ( the redshift of the last major merger with mass ratios of 1:3 and 1:10 are z=3.63 and z=2 respectively ) , a high spin parameter ( @xmath44 ) and no halo with equal or larger mass within a distance of 2 mpc .",
    "we perform runs with three levels of resolution in the resimulated region corresponding to an effective resolution of 512@xmath38 , 1024@xmath38 and 2048@xmath38 .",
    "this corresponds to particle masses for dark matter ( gas ) of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) respectively .",
    "star particles have half the mass of the initial gas particle mass . a gravitational softening of 4 ( 3 ) , 2 ( 1.5 ) and 1 ( 0.75 ) h@xmath3 kpc is used .",
    "we define our halos using the virial radius @xmath51 , which is the radius where @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the cold gas ( @xmath56k ) in the center of the halo makes up a clearly defined disk . in runs without star formation and feedback",
    ", all cold gas ends up in that disk . in the runs with feedback , some hot gas surrounding the cold gas is present , but the disk can still be distinguished clearly . when star formation is included , stars within the disk radius are defined as being part of the galaxy . since the rotationally supported gas disk",
    "gives a clear axis of symmetry , we rotate the system to have this axis aligned with the axis in z direction and the disk in the x - y plane . the total specific angular momentum j of the disk",
    "is then computed by summing over all disk particles , with respect to the center of mass of these particles .",
    "it is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 to compute the time evolution of the angular momentum , all particles belonging to the galaxy at z=0 are tracked back in time and the angular momentum is calculated in earlier snapshots for these particles with respect to the center of mass at the time .",
    "when star formation is included , the progenitor gas particles are used at the time when stars have not formed yet .",
    "our first , most basic set of runs includes dark matter and gas and the latter is subject to radiative cooling only .",
    "star formation and feedback are turned off .",
    "this should enable us to pinpoint the processes responsible for the loss of angular momentum and investigate the role resolution can play to avoid this process without the additional , probably positive effects feedback should have .",
    "we first analyze the results of our controlled semi - cosmological , isolated experiment in four different resolutions .",
    "some characteristic parameters of the different runs are summarized in table  [ tab : stats ] .    [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]       resolution , shown in the green dash - double - dotted line.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we analyze the loss of angular momentum by calculating in all snapshots the specific angular momentum of cold gas particles within a radius of 250 kpc ( which is the virial radius at z=0 ) .",
    "since most cold gas particles end up in the disk , this basically traces the angular momentum evolution of disk particles .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : amcomp ] .",
    "the highest resolution run ( 128@xmath38 particles in the underlying box , blue line ) poses a computational challenge . without star formation ,",
    "it is computationally infeasible to advance the simulation beyond z@xmath591.7 .",
    "we overcome this by replacing all gas particles at this point with collisionless `` star '' particles . in this way ,",
    "no further cooling is possible , but the disk is already largely in place at this point . reducing the computation to only gravitational forces enables us to extend the run until z=0 . for the angular momentum calculation unilt z=1.7",
    ", we use the cold gas within the virial radius , as in the other resolutions .",
    "after that we follow two different methods .",
    "first we tested to use all star particles within the virial radius ( thin , dash - dotted blue line ) .",
    "however , in a comparison of the same procedure for the 64@xmath38 resolution , we find much better agreement with the original gas run when following only the stars making up the galaxy at z=0 ( all star particles in a radius of 50 kpc ) .",
    "this is shown in the thin green dash - dotted line . applying the same procedure to the 128@xmath38 resolution results in the lower , blue dash - triple - dotted line .",
    "the discontinuity to the gas run at z=1.7 is due to the switch in calculation methods .",
    "the resulting angular momentum evolution of the two calculation methods are not very different .",
    "the result of the real gas disk is expected to be in between the two . in both cases ,",
    "there is good agreement with the evolution in the lower resolution runs , strongly indicating a gravitational effect as the reason for the angular momentum loss and ruling out artefacts from the hydrodynamics or sph implementation in the code .",
    "the behavior in all four resolutions is quite similar .",
    "for the highest resolution the loss is slightly stronger , indicating that resolution makes the problem more severe instead of improving it .",
    "we first calculate the ratio of the final over the initial specific angular momentum of the disk particles for our four resolutions . over our entire resolution",
    "range we find the same net loss of angular momentum of about 55% and no trend with resolution is observed .",
    "this indicates that a simple increase in resolution does not help to alleviate the angular momentum problem within the framework of the basic hierarchical model of galaxy formation .",
    "we now investigate , when and how the angular momentum is lost . in combination with figure  [ fig : semidiskevol ] ,",
    "figure  [ fig : amcomp ] clearly illustrates that the bulk of angular momentum is lost during the phase of evolution dominated by the infall and merging of smaller clumps . at z=1 ,",
    "the angular momentum ratio is j@xmath60/j@xmath61 .",
    "once the disk is established at z@xmath591 , there is still some loss , but this happens gradually with j@xmath62/j@xmath63 .",
    "this further illustrates that improved resolution does not strongly influence this process , since the loss not only follows the same pattern in all resolutions , it also would otherwise continue stronger even after the formation of the disk .",
    "we can further strengthen our conclusion by following @xcite and evolving the gas component adiabatically until z=1 .",
    "the lack of radiative cooling prevents the formation and therefore merging of small clumps in the gas .",
    "the disk forms quickly after the cooling is turned on at z=1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : amadiabatic ] shows the resulting difference for the gas in the 32@xmath38 run .",
    "there is still a loss of angular momentum , but it is smaller than before , with a final ratio for the disk of j@xmath62/j@xmath64=68.3% and j@xmath60/j@xmath64=95.1% at z=1 .",
    "halo in the standard case ( with radiative cooling switched on all the time , black thick curves ) with the run with adiabatic evolution until z=1 and cooling after z=1 ( blue thin curves ) .",

    "we use the medium resolution cosmological halo , with 1024@xmath38 particles effective resolution in the high resolution region .",
    "characteristic parameters of the halo and disk can be found in table  [ tab : stats ] .",
    "the disk in this case is as centrally concentrated as in the semi - cosmological case with 78% of the disk gas within the central 5 kpc .",
    "the build - up of the gas disk is shown in figure  [ fig : builddisksnaps ] .",
    "the top and middle panels have a side length of 1 h@xmath3 mpc in comoving coordinates and nicely show the hierarchical growth from small clumps to larger objects . in the time between the two middle panels ( z@xmath591.5 and",
    "z@xmath590.75 ) a last larger merger of two gas clumps occurs .",
    "after that , the disk grows only via accretion .",
    "the bottom panel zooms into the disk before and after that merger .",
    "it is interesting to now compare ( see figure  [ fig : builddisk ] ) the mass growth history of the disk ( solid line ) and the evolution of the specific angular momentum of the disk particles ( dashed line ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the points in time at which the snapshots in figure  [ fig : builddisksnaps ] are shown .",
    "the early growth of angular momentum accompanying the first collapse of the halo follows well the expectations from tidal torque theory ( j@xmath65 t ) .",
    "the maximum angular momentum acquired by the gas agrees well with the angular momentum of the dark matter halo .",
    "however , it can clearly be seen , that in particular the merger of two large gas clumps at z@xmath661.5 , which increases the mass of the disk by about 25% , is accompanied by a large loss in angular momentum ( about 50% ) .",
    "the ratio of final to maximum specific angular momentum is 0.37 .",
    "this is a little less than what we found in the semi - cosmological case , as expected , thus confirming and even strengthening our conclusions of the previous section .",
    "in figure  [ fig : sfresults ] , we show the gas and stellar component of the resulting galaxy in our simulations including star formation ( columns 1 and 3 for the semi- and the cosmological environments , respectively ) and including star formation and feedback ( columns 2 and 4 for the semi- and the cosmological environments , respectively ) .",
    "the first feature to notice is the ring - like structure of the gas disk in the semi - cosmological runs ( top row , columns 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the reason for this is the efficient transformation of gas into stars moving inside - out , and the missing late infall of gas to replenish the disk .",
    "the disk here is also much more defined than in the fully cosmological case , again due to the missing influence of late incoming clumps . in all cases , the young stars ( younger than 4 gyr , colored in blue ) and the cold gas ( @xmath67",
    "k ) form a fairly thin disk . in both the semi - cosmological and the fully cosmological run without feedback ( column 1 and 3 ) stars",
    "are formed very efficiently at early times , resulting in a dominant spheroidal component .",
    "this can also be seen in the strong peak in the star formation history at a t@xmath682 gyr ( bottom row ) .",
    "when feedback is included ( column 2 and 4 ) , star formation is quenched efficiently and a more prominent disk of young stars is formed while the large spheroidal component made up of old stars ( colored red ) is reduced .",
    "it is also noticeable , that the gas disk is much more extended than the young stellar component in the cosmological runs .",
    "this is in agreement with observations ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "why do we find such a large spheroidal component in the runs without feedback , even though the gas disk in the runs without star formation is very thin ?",
    "the answer can be found in the location and the time where the stars are formed . in our fully cosmological run ,",
    "star formation starts at z@xmath599 , and it peaks at z@xmath593 .",
    "this is the time when the progenitor of the z=0 disk is just starting to be assembled , so the majority of the stars are actually forming in larger mass clumps which fall in until z@xmath591.2 .",
    "after that , mass grows more slowly through accretion and the infall of smaller clumps .",
    "stars are continuously formed in the disk progenitor , but at a very low rate of about 2 @xmath69 .",
    "the stars entering the halo in clumps are not able to settle into a disk and therefore will form a spheroid . only the stars formed within the disk progenitor will be rotationally supported and can form a stellar disk .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : clumpdiskstars ] , which shows the distribution of stars at z=0 , divided according to their formation environment into `` clump stars '' ( stars formed outside of the disk progenitors and assembled into the galaxy via merging ) and `` disk stars '' ( stars formed in the progenitor of the z=0 disk ) .",
    "`` disk stars '' form a reasonably thin distribution tracing the gas disk , `` clump stars '' make up the large spheroid .",
    "one important diagnostic of the nature of the stars is the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion .",
    "both parameters are plotted in figure  [ fig : veldisp ] for all stars ( black line ) , `` clump stars '' ( red line ) and `` disk stars '' ( blue line ) . for `` disk stars '' ,",
    "this ratio is much higher , confirming their rotational support compared to dissipational support for `` clump stars '' . of all stars in the galaxy at z=0 , 30% are `` disk stars '' and 70% are `` clump stars '' .",
    "we performed a test where star formation was only turned on at z=1 , with the thin gas disk being more or less in place and further mass infall mostly through smooth accretion .",
    "the stars in this case indeed form a very prominent stellar disk , but no large spheroidal component",
    ".    in the feedback runs , star formation also begins early in individual clumps .",
    "the feedback however heats the gas and pushes it out of these structures , quenching the star formation in the clumps and enabling the gas do be accreted smoothly later directly into the disk where it then can form disk stars .",
    "this is evident from the reduced early star formation peak in the feedback runs as shown in figure  [ fig : sfresults ] .",
    "consequently , in the final galaxy we have only 35% of all stars formed in clumps ( and therefore a much less prominent spheroidal component as visible in figure  [ fig : sfresults ] right column ) and 64% formed in the disk progenitor .",
    "since now gas particles are converted into stars , we compute the angular momentum for the combination of cold gas and stars .",
    "the result for the semi - cosmological runs is shown in figure  [ fig : amloss_sfa ] .",
    "the loss is smaller when including star formation ( dashed line ) , but still substantial . in the case with feedback ( dotted - dashed line ) ,",
    "later accretion of gas with high angular momentum keeps the angular momentum of the disk high and the final galaxy has almost 90% of the initial angular momentum .",
    "gas is available for late accretion due to the decreased early star formation .",
    "the results for the cosmological runs are shown in figure  [ fig : amloss_sfb ] .",
    "we are tracking the cold gas and stars of the final galaxy at z=0 over time . in all three cases",
    "we see a drop in angular momentum at z@xmath591.2 , but it is less pronounced in runs with star formation and even smaller in those with feedback .",
    "however , in simulations with star formation there is some loss of angular momentum after z=1 , which is not as significant when only cooling is employed .",
    "this is probably due to the increased late accretion of gas and related hydrodynamical torques .",
    "compared to the maximum angular momentum , an even slightly higher percentage is lost in the case with star formation , and still about 50% with feedback .",
    "most of this loss occurs after z=1 .",
    "the feedback has reduced the loss owing to dynamical friction but increased the later loss due to hydrodynamical torques .",
    "while a loss of 50% still seems large , this is consistent with expectations comparing dark matter halos and observed disks @xcite .",
    "for the feedback case , we plot the results of runs with three different resolutions ( effective resolutions of 512@xmath38 , 1024@xmath38 and 2048@xmath38 ) , which behave similarly indicating that resolution does not affect this process much . we conclude that feedback in both the semi - cosmological and the cosmological simulations clearly helps to alleviate the angular momentum problem which is mainly due to the reduction of the early star formation and the resulting smaller spheroidal component .",
    "in this paper we have studied the causes of the angular momentum problem with special emphasis on the influence of numerical resolution and the impact of star formation and feedback .",
    "we performed a systematic study leading us from a controlled , isolated , `` semi - cosmological '' experiment to fully cosmological simulations .",
    "we also investigated simulations with different physical processes , once only taking into account radiative cooling , then including simple star formation and finally also including supernova feedback .",
    "the advantage of the semi - cosmological environment is to combine at moderate computational costs an isolated , well controlled halo with the small scale hierarchical buildup which is characteristic for a @xmath0cdm universe . by performing first simulations without star formation , it is possible to assess the importance of resolution in the hierarchical framework for structure formation , especially with respect to the angular momentum problem . our results clearly show that an increase in resolution in this case does not help against the angular momentum loss .",
    "the loss of angular momentum for the disk gas is of the same order while the resolution changes by orders of magnitude .",
    "we are also able to tie the angular momentum loss to the phase of collapse into small cold gas clumps which merge and form the main object .",
    "the main loss mechanism is dynamical friction of the clumps and larger mergers , as shown by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of dynamical friction is dominated by the largest clumps .",
    "these clumps can be tracked even in low resolution simulations ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this explains why , contrary to for example @xcite , we find no significant resolution dependence even though our resolution range is comparable .",
    "@xcite studied the formation of a gas disk starting in an equilibrium halo without taking the halo formation history into account , so their angular momentum loss is mainly due to hydrodynamical and gravitational torques during gas infall .",
    "this is a resolution - dependent process .",
    "we also see this effect , as can be seen in the run with cooling switched on only after z=1 ( figure  [ fig : amadiabatic ] ) and in the cosmological runs with star formation and feedback .",
    "however , the effect is much smaller than the loss during the merger period .",
    "we therefore argue that , in order to prevent the angular momentum loss in cosmological simulations , mainly the early formation of gas and star clumps must be prevented .",
    "the loss owing to limited numerical resolution appears to be only of second order .        in line with this argument",
    ", we observe a comparable loss in our fully cosmological simulation .",
    "it can be clearly linked again to the merging of two large gas clumps .",
    "unfortunately it is computationally not feasible to run this at higher resolution without star formation .",
    "however , even if resolution would have some influence in cosmological simulations ( contrary to the semi - cosmological case ) , this would only make the problem worse by increasing the number of resolved gas clumps .",
    "we are confident that this would not lead us to a different conclusion .",
    "the most plausible mechanism to prevent clump formation is star formation and related supernova feedback because it heats the gas .",
    "another possible source of heating would be the cosmic uv background .",
    "some low resolution tests we performed including this effect did not show any positive impact .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that a uv background may even have an adverse effect as it suppresses the infall of gas which is accreted late in the formation history and thus acquired high angular momentum . here",
    "we show the changes in the angular momentum evolution when star formation and supernova feedback is included .",
    "as expected , star formation alone does not result in an improvement , since the same clumps are spiraling in .",
    "they simply consist of highly condensed stars instead of highly condensed gas .",
    "star formation peaks high early on , and especially in the semi - cosmological setup , where late gas infall is missing , most gas is used up at z=0 .",
    "feedback helps to prevent this by keeping the gas too hot to form stars and therefore allowing it to settle into the disk later on as high angular momentum gas .",
    "we studied the origin of the stars in the final galaxy and found that without feedback 70% of all stars in the final galaxy enter in clumps . with feedback this is reduced to 35% .",
    "this can also be seen in the angular momentum of the final galaxy .",
    "clump stars form a slowly rotating spheroidal component and disk stars form a rotationally supported , high angular momentum disk .",
    "the final angular momentum of the gas and all stars combined is therefore much higher in our runs with feedback ( and a smaller spheroid ) than in the ones without feedback ( and a large spheroid ) .",
    "this is further illustrated when looking at the combined angular momentum of the rotationally supported component of the galaxy , consisting of the cold gas and the young stars only ( figure  [ fig : amloss_starage ] ) .",
    "this is roughly equal in the runs with and without feedback ( triangles ) , while for the total galactic angular momentum including all stars a clear increase can be seen from the run including only radiative cooling over the run with star formation to the run with star formation and feedback .",
    "this increase is due to the decrease of the central gas clump and then of the stellar spheroid .",
    "+ we conclude that an efficient suppression of the formation of dense clumps at early times is the main factor in reducing the angular momentum loss .",
    "star formation alone can not provide this effect since these dense gas clumps also fulfill the conditions for star formation resulting in a high early star formation peak and the formation of a large bulge .",
    "only feedback can reduce this effect efficiently .",
    "resolution overall plays a secondary role . in our simulations with star formation and feedback ,",
    "the angular momentum loss is about 50% which is in agreement with expectations from comparisons between dark matter halos and observed disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "this loss mainly happens at late times due to hydrodynamical torques . in our simulations with three levels of resolution in the cosmological halo , resolution does not influence this effect either . while feedback has such a critical role in the formation of more realistic disks in simulations , it is still not well understood .",
    "in @xcite we therefore present a detailed study of stellar feedback in disk formation simulations .",
    "we thank stefan gottlber and gustavo yepes for providing initial conditions and volker springel for providing a version of gadget2 which included radiative cooling . this work was funded through a grant by the german research foundation ( dfg ) under ste 710/4 as part of the priority programme spp1177 `` witnesses of cosmic history : formation and evolution of black holes , galaxies and their environment '' .",
