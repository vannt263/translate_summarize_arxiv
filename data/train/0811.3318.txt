    "electrons and holes in semiconductors can combine to form hydrogen - like bound states called _ excitons_. the creation and recombination of excitons is one of the principal mechanisms by which light interacts with semiconductors .",
    "furthermore , excitonic systems possess a number of unusual properties , such as the ability to transport energy without transporting charge , suggesting a range of applications in novel electronic devices .",
    "excitonic systems have therefore been the subject of numerous experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite studies in recent years .    in the low - density limit",
    ", excitons may be regarded as weakly - interacting neutral bosons.@xcite bose - einstein condensation of excitons is therefore possible .",
    "however , it has proved to be difficult to obtain exciton lifetimes that are sufficiently long for thermalization to take place , and the current experimental evidence for bose - einstein condensation is inconclusive.@xcite one promising approach for overcoming the problem of short lifetimes is the development of coupled - quantum - well ( bilayer ) systems , in which thin layers of semiconductor and an applied electric field in the growth direction are used to confine the electrons and holes to spatially separated , parallel , quasi - two - dimensional wells , hindering recombination and extending exciton lifetimes.@xcite    at present our understanding of the exciton - exciton interaction in bilayer systems is limited . on the one hand",
    "there is a repulsive electrostatic interaction between excitons .",
    "for example , if the layer separation is nonzero then the excitons have parallel dipole moments , giving an asymptotically dominant repulsive interaction .",
    "furthermore , the static charge distribution of each exciton has a permanent quadrupole moment in general ( even at zero layer separation , provided the electron and hole masses differ ) , giving another repulsive interaction term.@xcite on the other hand , fluctuating dipole ( van der waals ) forces result in an attraction between excitons at short range . because of the existence of the van der waals forces , it is sometimes possible for biexcitons ( bound states of pairs of excitons ) to form .",
    "a better understanding of the interaction between excitons in coupled quantum wells will facilitate the interpretation of experimental data , in particular enabling the determination of the exciton densities achieved in experiments .",
    "the dependence of exciton and biexciton binding energies on the layer separation has been investigated by tan _",
    "et al . _ , who found that , while the exciton binding energy decays slowly as the inverse of the layer separation , the biexciton binding energy decays extremely rapidly.@xcite recent studies of the exciton - exciton interaction using a heavy - hole approximation have found there to be a critical layer separation for each electron / hole mass ratio , beyond which biexcitons become unstable with respect to dissociation into two separate excitons.@xcite in this article we report quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations of the binding energies of biexcitons in bilayer systems and exciton - exciton interaction potentials .",
    "the rest of this article is arranged as follows . in sec.[sec : biex_binding ] we describe our calculations of the binding energies of biexcitons and investigate the range of layer separations and mass ratios for which biexcitons are stable . in sec.[sec : xx_interaction ] we present our data for the exciton - exciton interaction potential . in sec .",
    "[ sec : biex_pcf ] we report pair - distribution functions ( pdf s ) for biexcitons . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we use hartree atomic units ( @xmath0 ) throughout this article , although we report final energies in exciton rydbergs ( @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the reduced mass of an exciton and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electron and hole masses ) and lengths in terms of exciton bohr radii [ @xmath5 .",
    "we have modeled the coupled - quantum - well system by an idealized two - dimensional ( 2d ) bilayer , in which the electrons and holes are confined to two parallel planes , and the effective mass tensors of the electrons and holes are isotropic . in reality ,",
    "electrons and holes are free to move within quantum wells that are of finite width ( e.g. , one experimental setup@xcite has well widths of 8 nm and a well separation of 4 nm ) , although the coulomb attraction between electrons and holes should keep the particles confined to the inner edges of their respective wells .",
    "we have also restricted our attention to biexciton systems in which the two electrons have opposite spins , as do the two holes , because this is the ground - state spin configuration .",
    "we have studied biexcitons and exciton - exciton interactions using the variational and diffusion quantum monte carlo ( vmc and dmc ) methods . in the vmc method the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to a trial wave function is calculated using a stochastic integration technique.@xcite trial wave functions usually contain a number of free parameters , to be optimized by minimizing either the energy expectation value or the variance of the energy .",
    "dmc is a stochastic projector technique for solving the many - body schrdinger equation.@xcite dmc is in principle exact for systems with nodeless ground - state wave functions , such as the biexciton systems studied in this work .",
    "our trial wave function was similar to that of tan _",
    "et al._,@xcite with additional flexibility provided by multiplication by a two - body jastrow factor.@xcite this wave function satisfies the kato cusp conditions when particles coincide,@xcite and reduces to the form appropriate for two isolated excitons when the excitons are far apart .",
    "we also carried out some calculations using a three - body jastrow factor.@xcite for a typical case where @xmath6 , the reduction in the vmc energy from the inclusion of a three - body term was @xmath7 . obtaining",
    "the best possible trial wave function was especially important for the pdf calculations described in sec .",
    "[ sec : biex_pcf ] .",
    "we optimized the free parameters in our wave function by unreweighted variance minimization@xcite and linear - least - squares energy minimization.@xcite the trial wave function can describe the dissociated system more accurately than it can describe the bound system ; hence energy minimization is the more sensible choice for investigating binding , although this depends upon initial parameters and configurations .",
    "although the dmc energy is independent of the trial wave function , the statistical efficiency of the method is increased when the wave function is improved . by using a more flexible wave function ,",
    "we have been able to achieve considerably smaller error bars than tan _ _ et al.__@xcite all the qmc calculations reported in this article were performed using the casino program.@xcite    for each layer separation @xmath8 and electron / hole mass ratio @xmath9 , the biexciton binding energy was calculated as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the energy of a single exciton and @xmath12 is the energy of the four - body biexciton system . the exciton energy @xmath11 was obtained using a numerically exact runge - kutta integration technique as described in ref .  , while dmc was used to calculate the biexciton energy @xmath12 .",
    "the dmc energies were converged with respect to time step and population size ; any remaining bias is much smaller than the statistical error bars .",

    "et al . _  fitted an exponential form to their binding energy data , which resulted in the erroneous conclusion that biexciton binding persists to infinite layer separation .",
    "our dmc results show some deviation from the binding energies obtained by schindler and zimmermann,@xcite especially when @xmath16 , when @xmath17 , and when the mass ratio is close to 1 , because we have performed a full simulation of all four particles in the biexciton , whereas they simulated a pair of excitons interacting via a model potential .",
