    "<S> [ fig::vi ] . for broad dws in absence of the rashba coupling ( @xmath111 and @xmath109 ) </S>",

    "<S> a finite velocity @xmath112 arises when the current density exceeds a critical value . for a finite @xmath113 , </S>",
    "<S> the walker breakdown is observed , i.e. , a strong increase of the velocity for small current and a decrease beyond a critical @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> + however , the picture changes significantly for steep dws . </S>",
    "<S> here , even for @xmath106 , a finite dw velocity arises for @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> it actually resembles the walker breakdown for @xmath115 in the case of broad dws . for @xmath116 , </S>",
    "<S> the dw velocity decreases again . </S>",
    "<S> + a finite rashba field - like stt for @xmath72 mainly affects broad dws , since the nonadiabatic stt only can be dominant for narrow dws . </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have assumed a constant rashba coupling independent of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the rashba field - like torque is comparable for all @xmath70 and every magnetic field , such as an externally applied global field , moves broader dws faster @xcite . to remove this trivial width dependence , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a rescaled @xmath110 . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> the dw velocity then becomes independent of @xmath70 for broad dws . </S>",
    "<S> however , for small @xmath70 , a strong influence of @xmath107 on @xmath112 arises . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for a finite @xmath0 , even a substantial backward motion of the dw can be generated . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the dw against the current flow is induced by the antidamping field @xcite @xmath117 which is implicitly included in the stt . </S>",
    "<S> +    it is illuminating to discuss the case of small @xmath70 in terms of the nonadiabaticity parameter @xmath118 @xcite . for a nonlocal stt </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath119 becomes @xmath120-dependent with singularities at the roots of @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , an averaged nonadiabaticity parameter @xmath122 has been introduced @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig::b_w ] , we show @xmath123 for small current densities . for broad dws and @xmath109 , the expected result @xmath124 is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for steep dws , @xmath125 , the nonadiabaticity strongly increases . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly shows that the standard description of the stt fails . </S>",
    "<S> what is more , for finite @xmath126 , even for broad dws , it holds that @xmath127 , because the ( non)adiabatic stt also implicitly includes the antidamping field and the standard solutions for these stts no longer hold . </S>",
    "<S> + an alternative characterization of the nonadiabaticity results from observing that , for a constant stt , the dw velocity increases with @xmath128 for small current densities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we define @xmath129 by the derivative of the dw velocity with respect to @xmath108 and normalize it to the conventional @xmath0 valid for large @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ fig::b_w ] shows that also @xmath129 becomes maximal around @xmath130 , but approaches zero for @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> this further underpins the non - trivial behavior for steep dws which is not captured by the average @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> + finally , our findings apply also to magnetic textures other than bloch dws . for example , the increase of the nonadiabaticity in steep textures is responsible for the differences between steep vortices and broad spin waves @xcite , with an increased @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> + in summary , we have introduced a general procedure to calculate the complete spin - transfer torque in arbitrary 1d magnetic textures . </S>",
    "<S> it applies to the entire range of steep to broad domain walls and also can include other symmetry breaking interactions . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have discussed the rashba spin - orbit interaction . for abrupt changes of the magnetic texture , </S>",
    "<S> the stt , the dw velocity and the nonadiabaticity are qualitatively modified including backward motion of steep dws against the current . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that steep magnetic textures require a fully nonadiabatic description . </S>",
    "<S> an extension to two - dimensional structures such as vortices or skyrmions is straight - forward for the case of vanishing rashba coupling , while current flow perpendicular to the direct current has to be considered for finite couplings .    </S>",
