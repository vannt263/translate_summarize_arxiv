    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation is a powerful tool for describing bose einstein condensates at zero temperature .",

    "@xcite , we outlined a method for obtaining such exact solutions for a symmetric double square well situation with attractive interaction .",
    "we found an exact criterion to determine the bifurcation point .",
    "here we perform similar calculations for the repulsive case and extend our treatment , including wells of different depth but also a stability analysis .",
    "the repulsive case is perhaps more interesting in view of the fact that , for this interaction , situations such that most of the condensate was contained in one of the wells have been seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "we also present some dynamic calculations not included in @xcite for both kinds of interaction .",
    "these lean somewhat on a generalized josephson junction model @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that a josephson junction for a bose - einstein condensate was first obtained by inguscio s group @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "symmetry breaking solutions that are known to exist for positive nonlinearity ( repulsive interaction in the case of bec , dark solitons in nonlinear optical media ) often tend to localize the wave function in one of the wells .",
    "this happens for the nonlinearity exceeding a critical value at which the asymmetric solutions branch off from the symmetry preserving ones in the parameter space .",
    "therefore , we can talk about bifurcation at this critical value of nonlinearity .",
    "the existence of such solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation was first pointed out in the context of molecular states for repulsive interaction @xcite , as will be treated here .",
    "importantly , the effect of this spontaneous symmetry breaking has been observed in photonic lattices @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the nature of bifurcation depends on the symmetry of the problem and is of the pitchfork variety for even wells and saddle point for uneven wells @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider a double square well potential , first symmetric and then asymmetric .",
    "the asymmetric potential leads to more complicated profiles .",
    "as far as we know , these square well configurations are the only ones for which exact solutions exist",
    ". these solutions are all in the form of jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "one of the problems considered here , extending @xcite to repulsive interaction , is how to proceed from easily obtainable symmetric double well solutions of the linear schrdinger equation to the fully nonlinear case , and from so obtained symmetric solutions on to the bifurcated , asymmetric ones .",
    "when the _ potential _ is asymmetric both bifurcation of the static solutions and the dynamics of oscillating solutions will be seen to become very different from those for the symmetric potential .",
    "the manuscript is composed as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we derive symmetry preserving states starting from the linear limit and then gradually increasing the nonlinear interaction . in section",

    "even when the double well is symmetric , the nonlinear schrdinger equation is known to admit symmetry breaking states .",
