    "the interaction between localized magnetic moments and delocalized electrons contains the essential physics of many modern condensed matter systems .",
    "it is on the basis of nuclear magnets,@xcite heavy fermion materials of the kondo - lattice type,@xcite and ferromagnetic semiconductors.@xcite in this work we focus on the interplay between strong electron - electron interactions and the magnetic properties of the localized moments .",
    "low - dimensional electron conductors are ideal systems to examine this physics : the nuclear spins of the ions of the crystal ( or suitably substituted isotopes ) form a lattice of localized moments ; these spins couple to the conduction electron spin through the hyperfine interaction ; and the confinement of the electrons in a low - dimensional structure enhances the importance of the electron - electron interactions .    in previous work we have studied the magnetic properties of the nuclear spins embedded in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas of a gaas heterostructure,@xcite and in @xmath0c substituted single - wall carbon nanotubes@xcite ( swnts ) as a specific example of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) conductor . in this work we focus on 1d more generally than in ref . :",
    "we cover not only the case of swnts but also of gaas - based quantum wires or different ( yet not in detail discussed ) 1d conductors , under the assumption that the electrons are in the luttinger liquid ( ll ) state as a result of their interactions . in these systems",
    "the coupling between the nuclear spins and the conduction electrons has remarkable consequences .",
    "indeed , below a cross - over temperature @xmath1 ( in the millikelvin range for the considered systems ) the nuclear spins form a spiral , a helimagnet ( see figs . [",
    "fig : nanotube ] and [ fig : quantumwire ] ) , caused by the effective ruderman - kittel - kasya - yoshida ( rkky ) interaction induced by the electron system .",
    "the ordered nuclear spins create an overhauser field that acts back on the electron spins .",
    "this feedback is essential : it enhances an instability of the electron conductor toward a density wave order , and the electronic states are restructured .",
    "a gap appears in one half of the low - energy modes and leads to a partial electron spin polarization that follows the nuclear spin helix .",
    "the gap can be interpreted as a strong renormalization of the overhauser field , and so as a strong renormalization of the hyperfine coupling constant for the gapped collective electron modes .",
    "the remaining gapless electron modes in turn further strengthen the rkky coupling between the nuclear spins .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath1 of the nuclear spins can therefore lie much above the temperature that would be found without the feedback ( called @xmath2 below ) . in swnts , for instance , the feedback leads to an enhancement of @xmath1 by about four orders of magnitude .",
    "this means that below @xmath1 there is a temperature range where the nuclear order and the electron order exist only through their mutual stabilization . the nuclear spins and the electrons form a combined ordered phase , even though the energy and time scales in both systems differ by orders of magnitude .",
    "we remark that the order is unstable in the thermodynamic limit due to long - wavelength fluctuations . for any realistic sample length @xmath3",
    ", however , those fluctuations are cut off , the order extends over the whole system , and @xmath1 is in fact independent of @xmath3 .",
    "we discuss this physics here specifically for @xmath0c swnts and gaas quantum wires because such systems have become available for experiments recently : swnts with a purity of @xmath0c up to 99% have been reported in refs . .",
    "the cleaved edge overgrowth method@xcite has made it furthermore possible to produce quantum wires on the edge of a gaas heterostructure with ll parameters as low as@xcite @xmath4 .",
    "for both systems , we predict a feedback - generated cross - over temperature @xmath1 that lies in the range of 10  100 mk .",
    "this work is related to several studies found in the literature : nmr experiments@xcite on @xmath0c enriched swnts grown inside regular swnts@xcite have revealed the existence of a large gap of about 30 k in the spin response . while the microscopic origin of this gap seems still be unresolved , the nmr response could be well modeled with a partially gapped tomonaga - luttinger model.@xcite interestingly our microscopic theory predicts a spin excitation gap for a part of the transverse electronic susceptibility , although we consider isolated swnts and obtain a gap with a smaller magnitude below 1 k.    the coupling between a quantum spin chain and a ll was studied in ref . , and it was shown that this system can acquire gaps as well .",
    "such a system is very different from our model in that it involves a single chain of small quantum spins with anisotropic coupling to the electrons .",
    "such an anisotropy appears spontaneously in our case , and built - in anisotropy has a very different effect as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : anisotropic ] .",
    "a spin gap also appears in a ll in the presence of rashba spin - orbit interactions.@xcite lls with a gap in the spin sector are known as luther - emery liquids,@xcite and the partially gapped ll in our model has indeed a strong resemblance to such a system .",
    "yet the gap opens not only in the spin sector but involves a combination of electronic spin and charge degrees of freedom , therefore , in addition breaks the usual spin - charge separation of a ll .",
    "the rkky interaction at zero temperature was calculated for lls in ref . and for the case including rashba spin - orbit interactions in ref . .",
    "the use of the hyperfine interaction of @xmath0c to couple spin and valley quantum numbers in carbon - based quantum dots was explored in ref . .",
    "very recent spin blockade measurements@xcite on quantum dots formed by @xmath0c swnts suggest that the hyperfine interaction constant @xmath5 is by @xmath6 ",
    "@xmath7 larger than what is expected from @xmath8c data@xcite or band structure theory.@xcite however , this interaction strength is inferred from the comparison with models that were originally designed for gaas quantum dots , and so the precise value of @xmath5 requires further investigation.@xcite    the observation of ll physics has been reported for various 1d conductors such as carbon nanotubes,@xcite gaas quantum wires,@xcite bundles of nbse@xmath9 nanowires,@xcite polymer nanofibers,@xcite atomic chains on insulating substrates,@xcite mose nanowires,@xcite fractional quantum hall edge states,@xcite and very recently in a bulk material , conjugated polymers at high carrier densities.@xcite if there is a coupling to localized magnetic moments , we expect that the effect described in this paper should be detectable in these systems as well , with the exception of the chiral lls of fractional quantum hall edge states because they lack the backscattering between left and right moving modes that is crucial for the effect . to overcome this restriction , two edges with counterpropagating modes would have to be brought close together by a constriction .",
    "recently much progress has been made in producing and tuning the properties of carbon nanotubes as quantum wires or quantum dots,@xcite and ultraclean swnts are now available.@xcite    the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we state the conditions for the discussed physics and present the main results .",
    "a detailed account of the theory is then given : in sec .",

    "[ sec : nanotubes ] we show that the single - band description we have used in the preceding sections is appropriate for swnts , which normally require a two - band model .",
    "we shortly conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the appendices contain the technical details .",
    "the numerical parameters we use and derive for the swnts and gaas quantum wires are listed in table [ tab : values ] . for a brief overview ,",
    "we refer the reader to sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we summarize in this section the conditions and the main results of our work .",
    "this allows us to give an overview of the physics to the reader without going into the technical details and conceptual subtleties .",
    "these are then discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "two conditions for the described physics are important : a 1d electric conductor in the ll state confined in a single transverse mode ( in the directions perpendicular to the 1d conductor axis ) , and a three - dimensional ( 3d ) nuclear spin lattice embedded in this 1d conductor .",
    "higher transverse modes are split off by a large energy gap @xmath10 .",
    "the coupling of the nuclear spins to the electrons is weighted by the transverse mode , which eventually leads to a ferromagnetic locking of the @xmath11 nuclear spins on a cross - section in the transverse direction .",
    "consequently these ferromagnetically locked nuclear spins behave as a single effective large spin , allowing us to use a semiclassical description ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : confinement_1d ] and [ sec : interpretation_ni ] ) .",
    "this picture can be different for strongly anisotropic systems , where the coupling to the electron spin favors a different spin locking ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : anisotropic ] ) .",
    "however , the physics described here remains valid as long as this locked configuration has a nonzero average magnetization .",
    "in addition , we treat only systems in the rkky ( ref . )",
    "regime , which is indeed the natural limit for the electron  nuclear spin coupling .",
    "this regime is characterized by energetics such that the characteristic time scales between the slow nuclear and the fast electron dynamics decouple .",
    "this makes it possible to derive an effective instantaneous interaction between the nuclear spins , the rkky interaction , which is transmitted by the electron gas .",
    "if @xmath5 is the hyperfine coupling constant between a nuclear spin and an electron state localized at the nuclear spin site , and if @xmath12 denotes the typical energy scale of the electron system , the rkky regime is determined by the condition @xmath13 .",
    "this condition is naturally fulfilled in gaas - based low - dimensional conductors@xcite where @xmath14 ( for both ga and as ions ) and in carbon nanotube systems grown entirely from the @xmath0c isotope ( which has a nuclear spin @xmath15 ) where@xcite @xmath16 .",
    "recent measurements on @xmath0c nanotube quantum dots@xcite suggest a much higher value though , but still such that @xmath17 .",
    "an adjustment of this value , however , might be necessary because it relies on models that were not specifically tailored for @xmath0c nanotubes.@xcite to clarify this discrepancy between the reported values of @xmath5 further experimental and theoretical work is required .",
    "we can speculate though that a similar renormalization of @xmath5 as presented in this paper can also occur for the quantum dot system , and hence mimic a larger value of @xmath5 .",
    "due to this , the band structure value @xmath18 for the bare , unrenormalized hyperfine interaction strength is used in this work .",
    "the rkky energy is minimized when the nuclear spins align in the helimagnetic order . through the separation of time scales and due to the large effective nuclear spins , this order can then be treated as a static nuclear magnetic field acting on the electrons .",
    "most remarkably , this interaction is relevant in the renormalization group sense for the electron system and leads to the opening of a gap in one half of the electron excitation spectrum .",
    "this gap can be interpreted as a strong increase of the nuclear overhauser field in the direction defined by the nuclear helimagnet , while the hyperfine coupling in the orthogonal directions remains unrenormalized .",
    "the gap in the electron system is the result of the strong binding of collective electron spin modes to the nuclear magnetization .",
    "the resulting rkky interaction is then mostly carried by the remaining gapless electron modes and becomes much stronger .",
    "this leads to a further strong stabilization of the nuclear helimagnet . through this feedback",
    "the combined order remains stable up into experimentally accessible temperatures ( see below ) .",
    "the strong renormalization is in fact possible due to an instability of the ll toward a density wave order,@xcite which is signaled by the divergence of the electron susceptibilities at momentum @xmath19 .",
    "the same divergence is responsible for ordering the nuclear spins , and so the back - action of the overhauser field on the electrons enhances the instability for a part of the electron degrees of freedom .",
    "this results in the partial order in the electron system . due to this , the effect of the feedback is strong even for very weak @xmath5 .",
    "we emphasize that this feedback is a pure ll effect and absent in fermi liquids .",
    "it leads to a number of experimental signatures ( described below ) that may be used to unambiguously identify a ll without the need of fitting power laws to measured response functions .",
    "let us also mention that an alternative test of the ll theory has been proposed for strongly interacting 1d current rectifiers.@xcite here a pure ll signature is found in form of a specific asymmetric bump in the @xmath20 curve .",
    "table [ tab : values ] lists the physical parameters we use for the numerical estimates for the gaas quantum wires and the @xmath0c swnts .    [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     with these values we find that the feedback effect is most remarkable for the @xmath0c swnts where the cross - over temperature for the nuclear helimagnet without the feedback , @xmath21 [ eq . ] , would be close to a microkelvin . through the feedback ,",
    "however , @xmath21 is replaced by the correct @xmath1 [ eq . ] , which reaches into the experimentally accessible _ millikelvin _ temperatures . in table",
    "[ tab : values ] , corresponding to electron carriers in the swnt , while experimentally often hole carriers ( with @xmath22 ) are used .",
    "swnts with a linear dispersion relation ( armchair type ) are particle - hole symmetric and so the results exposed here remain unchanged ( see also ref . ) .",
    "spin - orbit interactions would break this symmetry , but recent experiments have shown@xcite that they are weak compared with @xmath12 in swnts .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that under normal conditions the ll state is stable under the inclusion of , for instance , rashba spin - orbit interactions.@xcite the effect from the coupling to the nuclear spins is much more dramatic and overcomes the spin - orbit interaction , which we therefore neglect in this work . ]    for gaas quantum wires the effect on the cross - over temperature is much less pronounced due to a less dramatic modification of the ll parameters . yet through the larger ratio @xmath23 we already have @xmath24 mk , which increases through the feedback to @xmath25 mk .",
    "figures [ fig : m_t_carbon ] through [ fig : t_kc_gaas ] show the dependences of these temperatures and of the nuclear magnetization on the variation of different system parameters .",
    "note that the large values of @xmath21 and @xmath1 for the gaas quantum wires are due to the small value of @xmath26 we use from ref . for high quality quantum wires . the more common quantum wires with weaker electron - electron interactions and @xmath27 lead to @xmath28 mk , as shown in fig . [ fig : t_kc_gaas ] . in this figure",
    "we also show the energy scale @xmath29 [ eq . ] , which we use as an upper bound for @xmath30 , below which our approach is controlled .",
    "further self - consistency conditions are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : self_consistency ] .    as a general rule ,",
    "stronger electron - electron interactions ( i.e. smaller ll parameters @xmath31 ) lead to larger @xmath1 in a much more pronounced way than a larger value of the hyperfine constant @xmath5 . the explicit dependence can be read off from eq . , and is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath34 the nuclear spin , @xmath35 is on the order of the bandwidth ( with @xmath36 the fermi velocity and @xmath37 the lattice constant ) , @xmath38 [ eq . ] a nonuniversal dimensionless constant of about @xmath39 for the values in table [ tab : values ] , and @xmath40 $ ] [ eq . ] , where @xmath41 are the ll parameters associated with charge and spin fluctuations , respectively .",
    "note that swnts require a 2-band description and so four different ll parameters@xcite ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : nanotubes ] ) .",
    "while we take this into account when we neglect the feedback , we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : nanotubes ] that the single - band description with @xmath44 is quantitatively valid when the feedback is taken into account , and therefore can be used for the determination of @xmath1 , and the renormalized hyperfine constant @xmath45 below .",
    "we stress that @xmath1 is independent of the system length @xmath3 for any realistic sample ( provided that we have @xmath46 such that the ll theory is applicable ) . for very large @xmath3",
    "there would be a cross - over where @xmath1 is replaced by a @xmath3-dependent quantity such that @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "this cross - over , however , occurs only at @xmath3 that lie orders of magnitude above realistic sample lengths ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : infinite_systems ] and appendix [ sec : small_level_spacing ] ) .",
    "the order parameter for the nuclear helimagnet is the @xmath19 fourier component of the magnetization , which has close to @xmath1 the behavior of a generalized bloch law [ eq . ]",
    "@xmath49 this magnetization may be detectable by magnetic sensors with a spatial resolution smaller than the period of the helix @xmath50 10  30 nm such as , for instance , magnetic resonance force microscopy.@xcite    the nuclear spin ordering acts back on the electron system and leads to a strong renormalization of the hyperfine interaction between the nuclear spins and a part of the electron modes .",
    "we can capture this renormalization by the replacement @xmath51 of the hyperfine constant .",
    "we emphasize though that this replacement also requires a reinterpretation of the role of @xmath45 : it no longer describes the local coupling between a nuclear spin and an electron at a lattice site , but the coupling of a nuclear spin to a fraction of the collective electron modes in the ll .",
    "the modified @xmath45 has thus a similar interpretation as the dressing of impurity scattering@xcite in a ll that no longer corresponds to the backscattering of a single particle but to the generation of collective density waves near the impurity site .",
    "the renormalization is expressed by [ eq . ] @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a correlation length . here",
    "@xmath55 is the thermal length , and @xmath56 the correlation length for an infinite system .",
    "we stress that that @xmath57 can not exceed @xmath3 or @xmath58 .",

    "hence the electron spin modes following the nuclear helimagnet ( ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically according to the sign of @xmath5 ) are pinned into a spatially rotating spin density wave .",
    "this affects , however , only one half of the low - energy electron degrees of freedom .",
    "the remaining electron spins remain in their conducting ll state .",
    "they do no longer couple to the ordered nuclear spins , yet couple to fluctuations out of the ordered nuclear phase with the _ unrenormalized _ hyperfine coupling constant @xmath5 .",

    "related to this we must examine that the energy scale @xmath30 obtained from the rkky interaction does not violate bounds imposed by the original hamiltonian .",
    "second , the separation of time scales between the electron and nuclear spin systems must be guaranteed , in order to be allowed to interpret the rkky interaction @xmath512 as instantaneous for the nuclear spins .",
    "the perturbative derivation of the rkky interaction@xcite or equivalently its derivation through a schrieffer - wolff transformation@xcite consists in an expansion in @xmath5 .",
    "the lowest order is proportional to @xmath5 , the scale of the second order is set by @xmath513 , higher orders scale in further powers of @xmath23 , and so the condition of validity of perturbation theory is usually set equal to the condition @xmath514 .",
    "this condition is perfectly met for the swnts or the gaas quantum wires . yet , there are a few subtleties .",
    "first , in the absence of the feedback , we have @xmath515(number ) , and the latter number can become very large .",
    "its maximum defines indeed the scale @xmath516 . through",
    "the schrieffer - wolff transformation we have in addition eliminated the term in the hamiltonian , which is linear in @xmath5 , and so there is no longer a proper `` first order '' expression to which we can compare @xmath277 .",
    "hence , the validity of the rkky scale @xmath516 must be checked in a different way .",
    "if we entirely neglect the electron hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath517 , we can ask which maximal energy scale can be obtained from the hyperfine hamiltonian for the nuclear spins .",
    "obviously this scale is obtained by polarizing all electrons such that @xmath518 , with @xmath415 , @xmath422 the ratio of electron to nuclear spin densities , and @xmath519 an arbitrary unit vector ( that may or may not be position - dependent ) . for temperatures smaller than the field @xmath520",
    "all nuclear spins are aligned along @xmath519 because a mismatch with the fully polarized electrons costs the on - site energy @xmath521 .",
    "essential for this argument is that flipping a nuclear spin out of its alignment costs only energy from the hyperfine interaction . the electron system is assumed to be energetically unaffected by this process ( the hyperfine interaction conserves the total of nuclear and electron spins , and so the electron spin changes as well ) .",
    "otherwise said , the electron hamiltonian @xmath193 is independent of the electron polarization . within this framework",
    "the rkky coupling between the nuclear and electron spins corresponds just to a more sophisticated way of treating the nuclear spin fluctuations .",
    "since the electron state has no influence by assumption , the maximal energy scale set by @xmath521 can not be overcome by any characteristic temperature obtained through the rkky interaction .",
    "this argument therefore applies directly to the case when we neglect the feedback between the nuclear spins and the ll .",
    "the condition then becomes @xmath522 with the values from table [ tab : values ] we can verify that this condition is indeed satisfied .",
    "the situation is of course very different if both systems are tightly bound together . in this case , one pays not only the energy @xmath521 but also the energy resulting from the modification of the electron state . through the feedback between both systems , this extra cost in energy is roughly taken into account through the renormalized hyperfine coupling constant @xmath45 [ see eq . ] .",
    "if we assume that @xmath45 fully describes the maximal electron response to the hyperfine coupling , then the scales obtained from the modified rkky description again can not overcome this scale .",
    "hence , we have the modified condition @xmath523 we must interpret this inequality with caution though .",
    "only one half of the low - energy electron modes contribute to the renormalization of @xmath45 .",
    "the coulomb interaction between the remaining electrons , which in fact substantially modifies the rkky interaction and determines @xmath1 , is not taken into account .",
    "yet , this modified rkky interaction is a direct consequence of the strong coupling to the nuclear system as well , and so the scale @xmath29 may still require further adjustment .",

    "however , we interpret eq . as assuring the validity of the theory , and not necessarily as a maximal upper bound on @xmath30 .    if we look again at table [ tab : values ] we see that @xmath525 for the selected values of gaas quantum wires and swnts [ within the @xmath371 uncertainty ] . hence , the fluctuations of the gapless modes stabilize the nuclear order up to the scale @xmath29 set by the gapped modes .",
    "this equality of the scales for the parameters of table [ tab : values ] is actually a coincidence , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : t_kc_gaas ] .",
    "note that if @xmath29 is controlled by the cutoff @xmath526 , increasing the system length also increases @xmath29 because more electrons are involved in the feedback effect . in swnts , for instance ,",
    "@xmath527 and @xmath528 .",
    "this means that doubling @xmath3 corresponds to an increase of @xmath29 by about 1.3 .",
    "since @xmath1 is independent of @xmath3 such a control of the bound @xmath29 may be quite useful .",
    "the rkky interaction requires that the electron response to a change of the nuclear spin configuration is instantaneous , and so a strict separation of time scales between both systems is mandatory .",

    "this results in the condition @xmath530 notice that this argument is very different from the previous argument leading to eqs . and , as it requires the physical , fully self - consistent averages , not a maximal energy condition .",
    "from table [ tab : values ] we see that condition is met for swnts and gaas quantum wires . since @xmath531 measures essentially the proportion of electron spin polarization ( see sec . [",
