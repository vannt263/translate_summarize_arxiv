    "young , massive star clusters ( ymcs ) are the most notable and significant end products of violent star - forming episodes triggered by galaxy collisions , mergers , and close encounters .",

    "the question remains , however , whether or not at least a fraction of the compact ymcs seen in abundance in extragalactic starbursts , are potentially the progenitors of globular cluster ( gc)-type objects .",
    "if we could settle this issue convincingly , one way or the other , the implications of such a result would have profound and far - reaching implications for a wide range of astrophysical questions , including ( but not limited to ) our understanding of the process of galaxy formation and assembly , and the process and conditions required for star ( cluster ) formation . because of the lack of a statistically significant sample of similar nearby objects , however , we need to resort to either statistical arguments or to the painstaking approach of case by case studies of individual objects in more distant galaxies .    the present state - of - the - art teaches us that the sizes , luminosities , and  in several cases  spectroscopic mass estimates of most ( young , massive ) extragalactic star cluster systems are fully consistent with the expected properties of young milky way - type gc progenitors ( e.g. , meurer 1995 , van den bergh 1995 , ho & filippenko 1996a , b , schweizer & seitzer 1998 , de grijs et al .",
    "2001 , 2003d ) .    however , the postulated evolutionary connection between the recently formed ymcs in regions of violent star formation and starburst galaxies , and old gcs similar to those in the galaxy , m31 , m87 , and other old elliptical galaxies is still a contentious issue .",
    "the evolution and survivability of ymcs depend crucially on the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) of their constituent stars ( cf .",
    "smith & gallagher 2001 ) : if the imf is too shallow , i.e. , if the clusters are significantly depleted in low - mass stars compared to ( for instance ) the solar neighbourhood , they will disperse within a few orbital periods around their host galaxy s centre , and most likely within about a billion years of their formation ( e.g. , gnedin & ostriker 1997 , goodwin 1997a , smith & gallagher 2001 , mengel et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "ideally , one would need to obtain ( i ) high - resolution spectroscopy of all clusters in a given cluster sample in order to obtain dynamical mass estimates ( we will assume , for the purpose of the present discussion , that our ymcs are fully virialised based on their ages of @xmath7 yr , i.e. , many crossing times old ) and ( ii ) high - resolution imaging ( e.g. , with the _ hubble space telescope ; hst _ ) to measure their luminosities and sizes .    in this paper , we explore the potential of a novel method to compare the properties of ymcs in the context of those of old gc systems , and predict their evolution over a hubble time . in section [ diagnostic.sec ]",
    "we outline the basic diagnostic tool we will use , based on the distribution of old gcs in @xmath8 space ( luminosity vs. central velocity dispersion ) .",
    "we extend this idea to younger clusters in section [ extension.sec ] , and discuss the uncertainties involved in our assumptions in section [ uncertainties.sec ] .",
    "section [ discussion.sec ] provides a detailed discussion of the implications of our results , and we conclude the paper in section [ summary.sec ] .",
    "it is well - known that the central velocity dispersion , @xmath2 , of old gcs in the galaxy and in m31 is tightly correlated with their @xmath0-band luminosity , @xmath9 ( e.g. , meylan & mayor 1986 , paturel & garnier 1992 , djorgovski 1991 , 1993 , djorgovski & meylan 1994 , djorgovski et al .",
    "mclaughlin ( 2000a ) suggests that this is a consequence of the tighter relationship between a cluster s binding energy , @xmath10 , and its luminosity , @xmath11 , which is one of the defining relationships of the gc fundamental plane . in fig .",
    "[ diagnostic1.fig ] we show this @xmath8 relationship for old gcs , represented by the filled symbols .",
    "we not only include the galactic and m31 gcs ( 56 and 21 objects , respectively ; pryor & meylan 1993 , djorgovski et al .",

    "although uncertainty estimates are available for both the photometry and the central velocity dispersions , we decided not to include error bars for the individual objects for reasons of clarity .",
    "as an example , slightly larger than typical error bars are shown for ngc 2419 ; generally speaking , the uncertainties in the central velocity dispersion are @xmath1340 per cent ( or 0.100.15 dex ) , while the photometric uncertainties are mostly smaller than the symbol sizes .",
    "we find that the additional local group gcs follow , within the measurement uncertainties , the @xmath8 relationship for the galactic and m31 gcs .",
    "this is consistent with unpublished results for the fornax dsph and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) gcs referred to by djorgovski & meylan ( 1994 ) .    the best - fitting relationship between the gc luminosities and their central velocity dispersion is represented by the long - dashed line in fig .",

    "mclaughlin ( 2000a ) predicted a dependence of the form @xmath17 for the pre - core collapse gcs in the milky way .",
    "he found that the form of the correlations obtained by projecting the gc fundamental plane depends only weakly on cluster properties such as galactocentric distance and concentration  in fact , these affect the normalisations of the relations rather than their slopes . our larger data set displays a relationship that is very similar to the predicted one .",
    "the most discrepant data point among the old gcs is that of the galactic gc ngc 2419 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ diagnostic1.fig ] .",
    "it is one of the most luminous galactic gcs , and yet has one of the lowest measured central velocity dispersions ; both of these observational parameters are well determined and the uncertainties are too small to allow for the cluster to fall within the normal scatter around the best - fitting relationship ( cf .",
    "olszewski , pryor & schommer 1993 ) . the arrow extending from the gc s location to higher velocity dispersions indicates the expected value for its central velocity dispersion based on its structural parameters and calculated using single - mass isotropic king models with a constant mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio of @xmath18 ( gnedin et al .",
    "ngc 2419 is a large ( half - light radius , @xmath19 pc ) , old ( @xmath20 gyr ) outer halo gc , located at a galactocentric distance of @xmath21 kpc ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "it is possibly not a normal gc , but has been speculated to be the stripped core of a former dsph galaxy ( e.g. , van den bergh & mackey 2004 ; but see section [ ymcdiagram.sec ] ) .",
    "its exclusion from the gc sample used to derive the best - fitting relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath1 does not alter this relationship significantly .",
    "the slope of the combined best - fitting relationship for all old local group gcs with measured velocity dispersions is , within the measurement uncertainties , consistent with the slopes most recently determined by djorgovski et al .",

    "[ diagnostic1.fig ] we have also indicated the 2 , 3 and @xmath25 envelopes toward fainter luminosities of the scatter of the gc data points about the best - fitting relationship ( short - dashed lines ; we have adopted a gaussian distribution of the scatter , for reasons of simplicity ) .",
    "we will return to these envelopes in section [ extension.sec ] , where we will discuss the distribution and evolution of the younger clusters also included in this figure , and shown as the open circles and open squares .",
    "encouraged by the tightness of the @xmath8 relationship for old local group gcs , we added the data points for the ymcs for which velocity dispersion measurements are available in the literature .",
    "these are indicated by the numbered open circles ; table [ clusids.tab ] provides an overview of the ymc identifications and their age and metallicity measurements , and photometry .",
    "the ymcs are ranked in order of decreasing ( central ) velocity dispersion .",
    "since most velocity dispersion measurements in the literature are given as the `` observed '' velocity dispersion , corresponding to the one - dimensional line - of - sight component , and denoted by @xmath26 or @xmath27 , where relevant we corrected these measurements to reflect the _ central _ value of the velocity dispersion profile . in practice",
    ", this corresponds to applying an aperture correction to the measurements from the effective size of the apertures used ( typically corresponding to @xmath28 , for a given ymc ) .",
    "we adopted djorgovski et al.s ( 1997 ) correction for m31 gcs of @xmath29 ( see also mclaughlin 2000a ) .",
    "although the exact value of the clusters concentration , @xmath30 , is unknown in most cases , this correction is applicable where @xmath31 ( so that @xmath32 ) .",
    "this condition is met for all of the ymcs in our sample .",
    "djorgovski et al . (",
    "1997 ) estimated the uncertainty of this correction to be a few per cent , i.e. comparable to the measurement errors .",
    "we note that while this procedure possibly introduces uncertainties that are hard to quantify , our subsequent analysis is based on these values in _ logarithmic _ parameter space , where the impact of these uncertainties is minimised , @xmath33 dex ( see mclaughlin 2000a ) . yet , since the central velocity dispersions defining the @xmath34 relationship span more than an order of magnitude , our analysis of the relationship in logarithmic space does not penalise us in terms of the resultant accuracy .",
    "it is less straightforward to understand the effects of conversions of the original photometric data to the @xmath0 band used to construct fig .",
    "[ diagnostic1.fig ] . yet , because of the relatively small number of ymcs with measured ( central ) velocity dispersions , we endeavoured to include as large a data set as possible in order to increase the statistical relevance of the comparison done in this paper .",
    "the penultimate column in table [ clusids.tab ] indicates whether a given photometric entry was taken from the original reference , or derived from the original data . in the following sections",
    ", we will discuss our approach to these derivations on an object - by - object basis .",
    "our photometric conversion procedures are based on the following general principles :    * where we needed to adopt a distance modulus to a given ymc s host galaxy , we used the most up - to - date values contained in the hyperleda database , except for m82 , where we adopted @xmath35 based on freedman et al.s ( 1994 ) cepheid - based distance to the m81/m82/ngc 3077 group . *",
    "conversions from a given passband to the @xmath0 band are age and metallicity sensitive ; we used the best available age and metallicity estimates , together with the most up - to - date galev simple stellar population ( ssp ) models ( schulz et al .",
    "2002 , anders & fritze  v .",
    "alvensleben 2003 ) , and assuming a kroupa ( 2001 ; hereafter kroupa01 ) imf , covering the mass range from 0.1 to 100 m@xmath36 ( see section [ mv.sec ] for details ) .",
    "the kroupa01 imf is one of the current best descriptions of the mass distribution of the stellar populations in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "below , we will also discuss the impact of adopting this imf on the uncertainties in our resulting , converted @xmath0-band magnitudes .",
    "puxley & brand ( 1999 ) obtained high - resolution mid - infrared spectroscopy of the two nuclear star clusters in ngc 1614 , using the gemini 8 m telescope .",
    "they calculated the objects individual bolometric luminosities to be @xmath37 and ( @xmath38 l@xmath39 , respectively .",
    "using the appropriate bolometric correction for the sun , we derive @xmath40 and @xmath41 mag , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties here are dominated by the uncertainties in the original conversion from mid - infrared flux to bolometric luminosity .",
    "the combination of using the bolometric correction for the sun and a metallicity of 2 z@xmath36 contributes an uncertainty of up to @xmath42 mag .",
    "this is of a similar order as the uncertainties in the original photometry , where given in table [ clusids.tab ] .",
    "photometry of the nuclear cluster in ngc 1042 was published by bker et al .",

    "for the best age estimate of @xmath44 yr , our galev models for the appropriate metallicity indicate @xmath45 mag , thus leading to @xmath46 mag .",
    "the uncertainties in this conversion owing to the imf parameterisation adopted are minimal ; comparing the @xmath47 values for all of the imfs discussed in section [ mv.sec ] below , and assuming solar metallicity ( see table [ clusids.tab ] ) , we find a maximum difference among the @xmath47 colours predicted of @xmath48 mag , ranging from @xmath49 mag for the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf truncated at 1 m@xmath36 , to @xmath50 mag for a non - truncated salpeter imf . by having adopted the kroupa01 imf ,",
    "we have essentially halved this uncertainty .    a more important contribution to",
    "the photometric uncertainty arises from the fact that we have assumed the ngc 1042 nc to behave as a clean ssp .",
    "however , we note that this is perhaps a questionable assumption : nuclear clusters are more likely to be contaminated by secondary and tertiary star - formation episodes than more isolated star clusters in the outer regions of their host galaxies ( e.g. , cid fernandes et al .",
    "2004 ) , so that in essence we are measuring the properties of a luminosity - weighted mean stellar population in this case .",
    "we will return to this discussion below .      of the ymcs in the antennae galaxies , only clusters [ ws95]355 and [ m03 ] required photometric conversions to the @xmath0 band ; for the other ymcs we adopted the original photometry . because of their young ages , of @xmath51 and @xmath52 myr , the photometric uncertainties in the conversions to the @xmath0 band are more significant for these clusters than for the older nuclear cluster in ngc 1042 .    for [ ws95]355 , mengel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported only an upper limit in the @xmath0 band , but a well - determined flux in @xmath53 .",
    "it is in this age range where uncertainties in the treatment of the more massive component of any ssp , and in particular that of the red supergiants , render colour transformations significantly uncertain . adopting the same set of imfs as above",

    "as we will see in section [ mv.sec ] below , when evolved to an age of 12 gyr , this ymc does stand out , by @xmath57 mag , from the majority of the other ymcs in our sample .",
    "therefore , we believe that we can confidently include this object in our statistical analysis of the @xmath58 diagnostic diagram , despite this large photometric uncertainty , and despite the considerable uncertainty introduced by the poorly bracketed effects of internal extinction in the antennae system ( see sect . [ mv.sec ] below ) .    unfortunately , we can not be as confident for cluster [ m03 ] .",
    "for this object , our only photometric data consists of the combination of a dynamical mass estimate ( @xmath59 m@xmath36 ) and a @xmath60-band m / l ratio of @xmath61 ( mengel 2003 ) . using @xmath62 ,",
    "we then obtain @xmath63 .",
    "similar analysis as presented in the previous paragraph shows that the inherent photometric uncertainties at its young age caused by imf variations amount to @xmath64 mag , ranging from @xmath65 mag for the ktg93 imf to @xmath66 mag for the truncated salpeter imf . by adopting the kroupa01 imf as our imf parameterisation",
    ", we reduce this uncertainty to @xmath67 mag .",
    "contrary to [ ws95]355 , [ m03 ] does not stand out from the sample objects in any specific way , and in view of the large photometric uncertainty , we can only conclude that this cluster appears to follow the trend set by the bulk of the sample ( see section [ mv.sec ] ) .",
    "our @xmath0-band magnitudes for the three ymcs in ngc 1487 , also observed by mengel ( 2003 ) , were obtained using exactly the same procedure as used for antennae ymc [ m03 ] .",
    "once again , because of the ymcs ages clustering around 8 myr , the photometric uncertainty owing to the @xmath60-to-@xmath0 conversion is significant and highly imf dependent , with the most likely uncertainty on the order of @xmath68 mag , as discussed above . as we will see in section [ mv.sec ] , although these three objects show tentative differences with respect to the majority of our cluster sample , when evolved to a common age of 12 gyr , the large photometric uncertainty does not allow us to draw firm conclusions on these perceived differences .      of the three sample ymcs drawn from the large cluster sample in m82 , we used the original photometry of smith & gallagher ( 2001 ) for m82-f , which the authors attempted to correct for the effects of a few saturated pixels .",
    "nevertheless , we are more confident using the corrected @xmath0 magnitude ( the quoted uncertainty in which already includes the effects caused by the saturated pixels ) than mccrady et al.s ( 2003 ) near - infrared _ hst _ photometry , in view of the much larger uncertainties introduced by filter conversions using a given imf ( see above ) .",

    ", we are hesitant to take this approach .    for objects",

    "given their age of @xmath71 myr , the uncertainty due to the passband conversion amounts to @xmath72 mag for the same range of imf parameterisations as used above .",

    "in addition , it may help us to determine whether the ymc formation process itself is ( close to ) universal ; 2 .   for most ymcs , luminosity evolution governed by a salpeter - type imf results in these objects ending up very close to the best - fitting gc relationship by the time they reach an age of 12 gyr ; 3 .",
    "a small fraction ( @xmath13 per cent ) of the ymcs appear to form a distinct group at significantly fainter luminosities than expected for old gc - type objects , if we evolve their luminosities assuming a salpeter - type imf .",
    "this implies that if their _ initial _ mass function ( mf ) was similar to the salpeter law , their _ present - day _ mf must be significantly depleted in low - mass stars if they are assumed to evolve to the gc relationship , as we will see below .",
    "alternatively , if the imf was unlike a salpeter - type imf , then comparison with the clusters discussed in point ( ii ) would suggest that imf variations exist in the highest - density regions in active starbursts , the birth places of these ymcs . in this context , it is worth noting that the tightness of the @xmath8 relationship for the local group gcs , and the lack of any significant dependence of gc properties on metallicity ( see also sect .",
    "[ uncertainties.sec ] and mclaughlin 2000b ) points to a universal imf in  at least  the local group .    of the 20 ymcs with projected central velocity dispersions smaller than those of the most massive gc candidates in the local group ( @xmath90cen in the galaxy , and g1mayall ii in m31 )",

    "since _ all _ of the gcs in our local group gc sample fall well within this @xmath91 envelope , we adopt this envelope as the stability boundary for a cluster to survive for a hubble time ( we realise that this is , of course , a relatively arbitrary assumption , but we will use it simply to guide the discussion ) . of the remaining 7 ymcs with projected central velocity dispersions smaller than those of @xmath90cen and g1 , 5 objects overshoot even the @xmath92 envelope if we adopt a standard salpeter imf for their stellar content .",
    "if this imf assumption is valid , then these objects would appear to be too dynamically hot , given their luminosities , to become old gc counterparts .",

    "hilker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) analysed two of the five fornax ucds in more detail spectroscopically , and concluded that while object cgf 5 - 4 is most likely older than @xmath95 gyr ( ages as young as 3 gyr can be excluded with confidence ) , the location of object cgf 1 - 4 in the mg@xmath96 vs. @xmath97fe@xmath98 diagram suggests an age as young as @xmath99 gyr ( @xmath100 uncertainty ) , based on its h@xmath101 line strength .",
    "in addition , drinkwater et al .",
    "( 2000 ) point out that the spectra of these objects are best fit by k - type stellar templates , consistent with an old ( metal - rich ) stellar population .",
    "this suggests that they might be related to gcs , since de galaxies observed with the same set up are best fit by younger f and early g - type templates .",
    "thus , the nature of these intriguing objects is still an open issue .",
    "if we now consider our sample objects with the largest central velocity dispersions in this context , and evolve their dominant stellar populations to a common age of 12 gyr , we find that they tend toward the best - fitting gc line , although within the uncertainties ( see section [ uncertainties.sec ] ) they are also consistent with objects following the fj relationship .",
    "we also note that while we have used ssp models to evolve the luminosities of these nuclear clusters to old age , this is strictly speaking not correct .",
    "nuclear clusters are not well described by `` simple '' stellar populations , but exhibit ( sometimes significant ) age ranges ( e.g. , cid fernandes et al .",
    "the implication of this is that , in fact , we may have _ overestimated _ the lengths of the luminosity evolution arrows in fig .",
    "[ diagnostic1.fig ] for these objects , depending on how much their stellar contents deviate from the ssp approximation , and from a salpeter - type imf ( see section [ mv.sec ] ) .",
    "the main consequence of this is that these nuclear clusters may indeed follow the fj relationship if they are able to survive to old age .",
    "thus , by placing the recently discovered ucds in this context , we believe that they may be closely related to nuclear star clusters , and perhaps are the stripped nuclei of de galaxies , akin to @xmath90cen , m31-g1 , and ngc 7252-w3 ( maraston et al . 2004 ; see also drinkwater et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "let us now briefly return to the suggestion by van den bergh & mackey ( 2004 ) that the unusual gc ngc 2419 may also be a similar type of object . if this were the case , we would expect the cluster to be located close to either the fj relation in fig . [ diagnostic1.fig ] or  if it were a genuine gc  to the fundamental plane correlation for galactic gcs ( e.g. , dubath et al .",

    ", the location of ngc 2419 is , respectively , @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( where @xmath104 represents the measurement uncertainty ) removed from the fiducial relationship .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is unlikely that ngc 2419 is the stripped core of a dsph galaxy .",
    "we note that , thus far , we have only considered the evolution of the ymcs in terms of their luminosity , and have ignored the possibility of significant evolution of the central velocity dispersion over a hubble time . following an initial phase of mass loss caused by stellar evolution , the long - term dynamical evolution of star clusters is dominated by evaporation due to internal relaxation and stripping due to external , tidal shocks .",
    "the latter process removes mass ( and luminosity ) , but should not significantly affect the central velocity dispersion ( e.g. , djorgovski 1991 , 1993 , djorgovski & meylan 1994 ) .",
    "it is unclear , however , how the central velocity dispersion evolves over time as a result of internal evolution in the presence of external tidal fields , significant binary fractions , the effects of mass segregation and core collapse .",
    "@xmath5-body simulations present an ideal way to investigate this problem . however , despite the vast literature on @xmath5-body simulations of star clusters , we are not aware of any paper which presents the evolution of the central , projected velocity dispersion of the simulated clusters .",
    "therefore , in section [ sigma.sec ] we investigate the evolution of the observable properties of a set of simulated @xmath5-body clusters in order to constrain the expected evolution of the observed @xmath2 .      in the previous sections we have constructed a diagnostic tool that could potentially tell us whether a given ymc might evolve into a gc - type object over a hubble time , based on only two observables : the cluster s ( central ) velocity dispersion and its @xmath0-band luminosity ( or absolute magnitude ) .",
    "this provides a simpler and potentially more reliable method to predict , to first order , the evolutionary fate of ymcs than existing methods . in particular ,",
    "the most common method to assess this issue is based on the comparison of dynamical cluster mass estimates with a variety of imf descriptions in the ( age vs. m / l ratio ) plane .",
    "this method introduces two complications that we can in principle avoid using the @xmath8 approach : in order to estimate an object s dynamical mass , one needs to ( i ) assume that the virial theorem applies ( which is generally assumed to hold for clusters older than @xmath105 myr ) , and ( ii ) obtain a reliable measurement of the cluster radius . while the complication introduced by the assumption of virialisation is minimal ( although it may play a significant role for the youngest objects in our sample ! ) , measuring reliable cluster radii is problematic for all but the nearest objects . in addition , using the half - light radius as an estimate of the volume occupied by the cluster implicitly assumes that the m / l ratio is constant across the cluster  an assumption that may be unjustified in the presence of significant mass segregation , as shown observationally ( see , e.g. , de grijs et al . 2002b , and references therein ;",
    "see also section [ m82clus.sec ] below and the discussion in mccrady et al .",
    "thus , here we have presented a simpler and potentially more reliable method to predict the approximate evolution for a given ymc than currently available .",

    "mengel et al . ( 2002 ) concluded , aided by ground - based @xmath60-band luminosities , that clusters [ w99]1 and [ w99]2 appeared to have a deficit of low - mass stars ( see their fig .",

    "if we adopt the assumption that these ymcs will eventually evolve to loci close to the @xmath8 relation for old gcs  at least , if they survive sufficiently long  then our diagnostic @xmath8 diagram suggests that clusters [ ws95]331 , [ ws95]355 , [ w99]15 , and [ w99]16 ( objects 19 , 6 , 7 and 11 in table [ clusids.tab ] , respectively ) are characterised by a present - day mf that differs significantly from a standard salpeter - type ( i)mf ; evolved to an age of 12 gyr using a salpeter imf , their luminosities will fade to well beyond the @xmath92 envelope .",

    "these discrepant results may in part be explained by the difficulty of obtaining clean cluster photometry from ground - based ( @xmath60 ) versus _ hst_-based ( @xmath0 ) data ; the difference in m / l ratios in mengel et al.s ( 2002 ) between the @xmath0 and the @xmath60 band is as expected if source confusion played a more important role in the ground - based images .",

    "however , the data of mengel et al . ( 2002 ) show a general offset between the @xmath0 and the @xmath60 band for all of their objects , so that this can not be the only explanation .",

    "finally , most of the objects that we predict to overshoot the @xmath92 boundary by a significant amount by the time they reach an age of 12 gyr are located in the higher - density regions of the system .",
    "it is likely that the ambient pressure in the interaction region is significantly higher , and externally driven dynamical evolution proceeds faster than in the more quiescent spiral arm regions ( section [ implications.sec ] ) ; this may render invalid the assumption that these clusters are in virial equilibrium , in particular in view of their very young ages , of @xmath109 myr ( mengel et al .",

    "having established that , to first order , the @xmath8 diagram provides us with a diagnostic tool to assess the similarities ( and differences ) of ymcs compared to old gcs , we will now assess the uncertainties inherent to this approach .",

    "subsequently , in section [ sigma.sec ] we will present the results of detailed _",
    "n_-body simulations to obtain a feeling for the uncertainties associated with the evolution of the central velocity dispersion over a hubble time .",
    "the main issue we need to address regarding the luminosity evolution of our sample ymcs , as represented by the `` luminosity evolution arrows '' in fig .",
    "[ diagnostic1.fig ] , is the accuracy of the arrow lengths .",
    "in addition , we will address a number of issues related to the accuracy of the photometric measurements of the objects themselves .",
    "regarding the former , the key issues to be discussed are the dependence of the luminosity evolution on ( i ) metallicity and ( ii ) the adopted imf ( and , therefore , on the adopted ssp models ) .    in fig .",
    "[ uncertainties.fig]a , we show the expected length of the luminosity evolution arrow as a function of cluster age , ( @xmath122 ) , for the five different metallicities included in the galev ssps . for the purposes of this discussion ,",
    "we have adopted a salpeter imf , covering stellar masses from 0.1 to 100 m@xmath36 .",
    "it is clear that the effect of adopting an incorrect metallicity is roughly constant as a function of age , and amounts to an error of @xmath123 mag over the entire age range spanned by our ymc sample if solar metallicity were incorrectly assumed .",
    "the effect decreases slightly for cluster ages @xmath124 yr .",
    "we note that we have taken great care to adopt the most appropriate metallicity for our sample ymcs ( see table [ clusids.tab ] ) , so that we are confident that we have minimised the uncertainties associated with the choice of cluster metallicity .",
    "secondly , we explore the effects of varying the imf , @xmath125 .",
    "we consider the effects of varying both the slope , @xmath126 , and the low - mass cut - off of the imf . in order to do so , we calculated the age dependence of the length of the `` evolution arrows '' in fig .",
    "[ uncertainties.fig]b for five different imf representations , and solar metallicity . except for imf ( ii ) below , where we use the starburst99 ssps ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) , we use the galev ssps in all cases , and assume the imf to cover the mass range from 0.1 to 100 m@xmath36 .",
    "we consider the following imfs , the effects of which on the luminosity evolution are shown in fig .",
    "[ uncertainties.fig]b :    1 .",
    "the `` standard '' salpeter imf , for masses between 0.1 and 100 m@xmath36 , and @xmath127 for the entire mass range ; 2 .",
    "the @xmath127 salpeter imf , but for the mass range @xmath128 m@xmath36 ; 3 .",
    "the scalo ( 1986 ) imf , for masses @xmath129 , characterised by @xmath130 4 .   the ktg93 imf , with @xmath131 and 5 .",
    "the kroupa01 imf : @xmath132    figure [ imfs.fig ] displays the functional forms of these imfs , normalised to a standard salpeter imf at 1 m@xmath36 , which contains a total mass of 1 m@xmath36 .",
    "this standard salpeter imf is shown as the solid line , and is used as reference in the following . except for the truncated salpeter imf ( short - dashed line ) , the other",
    ", more realistic imfs are characterised by a turnover at or below 1 m@xmath36 , and an enhanced contribution of intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath133 ) compared to the full salpeter imf . in all cases , however , they are dominated by the lower - mass stars and provide , therefore , a solid basis for any compact virialised system to survive for up to a hubble time ( e.g. , gnedin & ostriker 1997 , goodwin 1997a , smith & gallagher 2001 , mengel et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "it is clear that the effects on the luminosity evolution arrow of varying the imf are significant for all ages below several @xmath134 yr .",
    "any correction to the length of the luminosity evolution arrow caused by a significant change in the imf ( for the imfs discussed in this paper ) is in the sense that the length of the arrow will be _ reduced _ ; for the kroupa01 and truncated salpeter imfs the effect is expected to be negligible .",
    "thus , by adopting a more realistic imf than the standard salpeter representation ( such as the ktg93 imf , which accurately describes the solar neighbourhood imf ) , those clusters that in our current diagnostic diagram of fig . [ diagnostic1.fig ] would evolve to locations well beyond the @xmath92 envelope of the gc relationship if they were characterised by a salpeter - type imf down to the hydrogen - burning limit might well evolve to a location within @xmath135 .",
    "in addition , if we had assumed any more realistic imf description for the luminosity evolution of our sample ymcs , the evolved loci of most of these objects might have scattered more symmetrically around the best - fitting gc relation , instead of systematically ending up on the faint side of the correlation ( we have confirmed this for the case of the ktg93 imf ) .    based on the currently available data",
    ", we can not draw firm conclusions on the actual ( i)mfs of our sample clusters . detailed follow - up _",
    "n_-body simulations , including the effects of primordial and dynamical mass segregation , and of varying binary fractions , are required to address this issue more robustly .",
    "this is , however , beyond the scope of the present work . on the other hand , the fact that most clusters , when evolved using a standard solar - neighbourhood salpeter - type imf , appear to end up close to the gc relationship is suggestive of the near - universality of an imf for extragalactic ymcs of any of the currently fashionable forms discussed in this paper . based on the available evidence ,",
    "it is therefore more likely that the six ymcs that appear to have a central velocity dispersion that is significantly too large for their mass ( luminosity ) will disperse before reaching gc - type ages , than that they were characterised by significantly different _ initial _ mfs ( and possibly very different _ present - day _ mfs ; see also section [ implications.sec ] ) .",
    "thirdly , there are a number of observational uncertainties that affect the accuracy of the location of the data points at the present epoch .",

    "djorgovski ( 1991 , 1993 ; see also djorgovski & meylan 1994 ) suggested that the relation evolved from a primordial scaling relation , @xmath156 ( assuming a constant m / l ratio among gcs ) , which would be subsequently altered by tidal shocks , leading to mass ( and therefore luminosity ) losses .",
    "this would be more efficient for the less massive clusters , thus resulting in a steepening of the relationship to its currently observed form .",
    "mclaughlin ( 2003 ) suggests that the relation is linked to the mass - dependent star - formation efficiencies in giant molecular clouds , the progenitors of star clusters .",
    "we note that the fact that _ all _ local group gcs are found scattering closely around the relationship implies that its origin must be related to gc - internal processes . the tightness of the relationship rules out significant environmental effects as principal cause for its origin .",
    "this is simply because the local group gcs are found in a wide variety of environments , ranging from the high - density environments in the galaxy and m31 , via the intermediate density operating in m33 , to the ( very ) low density environments in the dwarf satellite galaxies ( lmc , smc , fornax dsph ) .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by mclaughlin ( 2000a ) when he noted that galactic gcs at larger galactocentric distances exhibit a smaller scatter about the relationship than those closer to the milky way .",
    "the fact that we find that our sample ymcs , when evolved to a common age of 12 gyr using the salpeter imf , may also evolve to loci close to the best - fitting gc relationship implies that the initial conditions governing these ymc must have been very similar to those responsible for the formation of the old local group gcs .",
    "this , therefore , provides an argument in favour of the suggestion that most of these ymcs may in fact be proto - gcs .",
    "it also suggests that a large number of the present - day young compact lmc ( and smc ) clusters , as well as the large majority of the galactic open clusters , all of which are currently found to occupy regions close to the old gc relationship ( in some cases further toward fainter magnitudes than any of the known gcs , for a given central velocity dispersion ) , are unlikely to survive until they reach gc - type ages of @xmath157 gyr .",
    "thus far , we have been dealing predominantly with internal cluster processes that might prevent ( a number of ) the ymcs from surviving for a hubble time .",
    "the most likely _ internal _ processes leading to cluster disruption were found to be related to variations in the imf .",

    "this assumption is clearly not justified in a number of cases considered in this paper .",
    "one should realise that star cluster survivability also  and crucially so ",
    "depends on external factors affecting its stellar content , such as tidal shocking by galactic discs , bulges , spiral arms and giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , and the associated ram - pressure stripping .",

    "if we place our own results in this context , we see that four of the six clusters that are expected to evolve to beyond the @xmath160 boundary by an age of 12 gyr are in fact located in the high - density overlap region in the antennae galaxies .",
    "we would expect these objects to dissolve on shorter - than - average time - scales , simply because of the higher density ism in which they are embedded , and because of the high pressure and tidal shocks expected in the ongoing merger .",
    "similarly , the remaining two objects ( ngc 1487 - 3 and ic 342-nc ) are located in high - density galactic centre environments . by the same token , ngc 1487 - 1 and 2 , and ngc 5236 - 805 are located in similarly high - density environments ; their luminosity evolution arrows do , in fact , overshoot the @xmath91 envelope .",

    "if we assume that the _ initial _ mf of all of these objects was roughly constant for the entire ymc sample , this implies that tidal effects and their location in regions of higher - than - average density must have affected the stellar content of these clusters already on time - scales as short of @xmath162 yr , i.e. , a significant fraction of the low - mass stars in these objects has likely been tidally stripped already during their very short lifetimes .",
    "ongoing tidal effects would lead to luminosity evolution to still fainter magnitudes than implied by assuming a salpeter - type imf .    now that we have established that a number of our sample clusters are already likely to have been affected significantly by tidal effects and externally induced disruption , despite their young ages , we return to the origin of the tight gc relation . with the remainder of our sample ymcs , except the most massive objects that may be governed by the fj relation rather than the old gc correlation , we can now test the suggestion by djorgovski ( 1991 , 1993 ) and djorgovski & meylan ( 1994 ) that at the time of _ proto - globular _ cluster formation the clusters ( central ) velocity dispersion correlated linearly with their luminosity . for the following arguments",

    "this result excludes a linear @xmath166 relation at the @xmath167 level .",

    "thus , the observed relation for the youngest ymcs has exactly the form expected for clusters in virial equilibrium , provided that ( i ) the cluster radii are independent of their luminosities , ( ii ) the cluster radii have not changed significantly since the clusters were @xmath172 myr old , and ( iii ) the ratio of central velocity dispersion @xmath2 to the total cluster dispersion is independent of luminosity . with regard to the first point ,",

    "note that in the @xmath5-body simulations presented in section [ sigma.sec ] the low - mass clusters were systematically smaller in radius than the more massive clusters , which is why the simulated low - mass clusters do not lie on the young ymc relation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nbody_evol ] ) .",
    "the half - light radius of a cluster is most significantly affected by the expulsion of gas immediately following the end of star formation , which results in the expansion of the cluster by up to a factor of @xmath173 ( boily & kroupa 2003 , goodwin 1997b ) . bound clusters",

    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that the half - light radii have not evolved significantly since an age of 8 myr  even if some of the clusters have expanded since that time , eq .",
    "( [ sigma.eq ] ) shows that the magnitude of this effect will be less than 0.35 dex in @xmath174 .",
    "finally , the absence of significant luminosity dependence of the ratio of central to total cluster velocity dispersions is expected for clusters in equilibrium .",
    "[ initconds.fig ] is thus consistent with the youngest ymcs having rapidly achieved virial equilibrium . in order to strengthen this result",
    ", it would be interesting to use accurate determinations of cluster radii to confirm the independence of the cluster sizes and luminosities in the extragalactic ymc sample .",
    "the simple , virial @xmath8 relation for the youngest clusters in our ymc sample may be the pre - cursor for the fundamental plane of globular clusters .",
    "clearly , quiescent evolution would be expected to transform a primordial linear relation into another linear relation since two clusters which are initially close together in the @xmath175 plane will evolve similarly provided their external environments do not differ too greatly .",
    "the change in the slope of the relation is then probably due to the dependence of the @xmath2 evolution on the mass of the cluster .",
    "the increased relaxation time of more massive clusters would be expected to lead to less evolution in these clusters than is seen in the lower mass clusters ; we also note that the amount of luminosity evolution is driven by relative age differences and , to first order , independent of a cluster s initial luminosity .",
    "this would naturally account for the steeper slope of the late - time relation seen for the local group gcs .",
    "further numerical simulations are required to confirm that this picture is consistent in all respects with the observations .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new analysis of the properties and possible evolutionary paths of the ymcs forming profusely in intense starburst environments , such as those associated with galaxy interactions and mergers .",
    "the method hinges on the empirical relationship for old galactic and m31 gcs , which occupy a tightly constrained locus in the plane defined by their @xmath0-band luminosities , @xmath1 ( or , equivalently , absolute magnitudes , @xmath9 ) and central velocity dispersions , @xmath2 ( djorgovski et al .",

    "the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 for this increased gc sample , @xmath176 ( km s@xmath4 ) , is within the uncertainties consistent with djorgovski et al.s ( 1997 ) determination for the smaller galactic and m31 gc sample .",
    "the tightness of the relationship for a sample drawn from environments as diverse as those found in the local group , ranging from high to very low ambient densities , implies that its origin must be sought in intrinsic properties of the gc formation process itself , rather than in external factors .",
    "this is further supported by mclaughlin s ( 2000a ) result that gcs at greater galactocentric distances exhibit a smaller scatter about the relation than closer objects .",
    "encouraged by the tightness of the gc relationship , we also added the available data points for the ymcs in the local universe , including nuclear star clusters , for which velocity dispersion information was readily available . in order to be able to compare them to the ubiquitous old local group gcs",
    ", we evolved their luminosities to a common age of 12 gyr , adopting the `` standard '' ( solar neighbourhood ) salpeter imf covering masses from 0.1 to 100 m@xmath36 , and assuming stellar evolution as described by the galev ssps .",
    "based on a careful assessment of the uncertainties associated with this luminosity evolution , we concluded that the most important factor affecting the robustness of our conclusions is the adopted form of the stellar imf .",
    "we found that if we adopt the salpeter imf as the basis for the ymcs luminosity evolution , the large majority will evolve to loci within twice the observational scatter around the best - fitting gc relationship ( although systematically to somewhat fainter luminosities ) . using more realistic imf descriptions , our ymc sample do , in fact ,",
    "end up scattering more closely about the improved local group gc relationship . in the absence of significant external disturbances",
    ", this implies that these objects may potentially survive to become old gc - type objects by the time they reach a similar age .",

    "detailed case by case comparisons between our results based on this new method with those obtained previously and independently based on dynamical mass estimates and m / l ratio considerations lend significant support to the feasibility and robustness of our new method , and provide a key insight into the inherent uncertainties associated with any of the methods used in this field . the key characteristic and main advantage of this method compared to the more complex analysis involved in using dynamical mass estimates for this purpose is its simplicity and empirical basis . where dynamical mass estimates require one to obtain accurate size estimates and to make assumptions regarding a system",

    "mclaughlin ( 2000a ) has shown that this is , in fact , a physically relevant correlation , since ( i ) the @xmath177 diagram ( where @xmath10 is the cluster binding energy ) is composed of physically meaningful quantities , and ( ii ) the scatter about the correlation is of the same order as the observational uncertainties .",
    "careful analysis of those ymcs that would overshoot the gc relationship significantly if they were to survive for a hubble time ( and are characterised by a salpeter - type initial or present - day mf ) showed that their unusually high ambient density has probably already had a significant effect on their stellar content , despite their young ages , thus altering their present - day mf in a such a way that they have become unable to survive for any significant length of time .",
    "this is , again , supported by independent analyses , thus further strengthening the robustness of our new approach .",
    "the expected loci in the @xmath8 plane that these objects would evolve to over a hubble time are well beyond any gc luminosities for a given velocity dispersion , leading us to conclude that they will either dissolve long before reaching gc - type ages , or that they must be characterised by a present - day mf that is significantly depleted in low - mass stars ( or highly mass segregated ) , thus also resulting in fast dispersion .",
    "this , therefore , allows us to place moderate limits on the functionality of their present - day mfs .    in order to investigate whether dynamical evolution would have a dramatic impact on the evolution of clusters in the @xmath58 plane , we analysed the results of a number of @xmath5-body simulations .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the model clusters were calculated in a manner analogous to that used for the observed clusters .",
    "we concluded that the evolution of the observed @xmath2 is relatively small for clusters that survive to old age , and thus our conclusions remain unchanged .    based on our analysis of the objects with the largest velocity dispersions , including the nuclear star clusters",
    ", we conclude that the recently discovered ucds in the fornax cluster may be most closely related to stripped dsph or de nuclei .",
    "we also show that the unusual galactic gc ngc 2419 is unlikely to be a similar type of object , despite recent suggestions to the contrary .",
    "finally , we evolved those ymcs that appear to be least affected by external disruptive effects and are likely to be well - represented by salpeter - type imfs back to a common young age of 8 myr , in order to assess the @xmath8 relationship in almost - initial conditions . the resulting best - fitting relationship , @xmath178 ( km s@xmath4 ) , implies that these clusters follow a simple virial relation .",
    "the evolution of relatively undisturbed star clusters in the @xmath58 plane , as seen in our @xmath5-body simulations , will subsequently transform this relation into the steeper relation displayed by the local group gcs .",
    "the existence of a simple , virial @xmath8 relationship for the youngest ymcs may therefore constitute the origin of the gc fundamental plane .",

    "<S> + we evolve the luminosities of those young massive star clusters ( ymcs ) in the local universe which have velocity dispersion measurements to an age of 12 gyr , adopting a variety of imf descriptions , and find that most ymcs will evolve to loci close to , or to slightly fainter luminosities than the improved gc relationship . in the absence of significant external disturbances , this implies that these objects may potentially survive to become old gc - type objects over a hubble time . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of our new method is its simplicity . where alternative methods , based on dynamical mass estimates , require one to obtain accurate size estimates and to make further assumptions , the only observables required here are the system s velocity dispersion and luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the most important factor affecting the robustness of our conclusions is the adopted form of the initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> we use the results of @xmath5-body simulations to confirm that dynamical evolution of the clusters does not significantly alter our conclusions about the likelihood of individual clusters surviving to late times . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that our youngest observed clusters are consistent with having evolved from a relation of the form @xmath6 ( km s@xmath4 ) . </S>",
