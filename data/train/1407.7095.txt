    "magnetization reversal in a single - domain ferromagnetic nanostructure is an important phenomenon for both fundamental physics and applications .",
    "the conventional method for reversing magnetization is to apply a direct magnetic field to a ferromagnet along the reversed direction , where the field magnitude @xmath0 should be larger than the anisotropy field ( or coercivity ) @xmath1 to energetically stabilize the reversed state @xcite .",
    "however , this method requires a large field @xmath0 anti - parallel to the magnetization , as well as large power consumption , for the reversal because ferromagnets with large @xmath1 are used in practical applications to keep the high thermal stability @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the magnetization , the volume of the ferromagnet , and the temperature , respectively .",
    "recently alternative methods , such as spin - torque - induced magnetization reversal @xcite and microwave - assisted magnetization reversal ( mamr ) @xcite , have been proposed to reduce the reversal field magnitude .",
    "the optical magnetization reversal with circularly polarized light @xcite is another possibility , where the combination of the ultrafast heating and the magnetic field , both of which are generated by the circularly polarized laser , enables the ultrafast magnetization reversal without an external field .    in mamr ,",
    "the microwave produces a circularly rotating magnetic field applied to the ferromagnet , in which the field direction lies in a plane perpendicular to the easy axis .",
    "a rotating frame is conventionally used to understand why the reversal field becomes smaller than @xmath1 in mamr @xcite . in the rotating frame ,",
    "the field acting on the magnetization is independent of time .",
    "the effect of the rotating field is converted to an additional dc magnetic field @xmath6 pointing in the reversed direction @xcite , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the frequency of the rotating field and the gyromagnetic ratio , respectively , i.e. , the total dc magnetic field pointing in the reversed direction is @xmath9 .",
    "the additional field @xmath6 energetically stabilizes the reversed state , and reduces the reversal field magnitude . in a low - frequency region ,",
    "the reversal field linearly decreases as the frequency increases , which is qualitatively consistent with this conventional picture .",
    "however , both the experiments and the numerical simulations of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation have revealed that such a conventional picture can not explain the dependence of the reversal field on the frequency in a high - frequency region @xcite . in the high - frequency region ,",
    "the reversal field slightly increases as the frequency increases ; see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] below .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the total dc magnetic field for the reversal , @xmath9 , in the high - frequency region is much larger than @xmath1 .",
    "this result seems like in contradiction with the stoner - wohlfarth theory @xcite , in which the magnetization reversal should occur when @xmath9 becomes slightly larger than @xmath1 because only the reversed state is energetically stable .",
    "okamoto _ et al .",
    "_ studied the dependence of the reversal field on the frequency of the rotating field for a co / pt nanodot with 120 nm diameter both experimentally and numerically based on the micromagnetic model @xcite .",
    "they found that the excitation of the spin wave , which arises from the difference in the local demagnetization field between the end and center of the dots , leads to a reduction of the reversal field .",
    "this result is of great advance in understanding the reversal mechanism of mamr .",
    "however , it is still unclear why the reversal field jumps to a high value at a certain frequency .",
    "moreover , the numerical simulations based on the macrospin ( single domain ) model also show the jump of the reversal field @xcite , indicating that not only the excitation of the spin wave but also other mechanisms lead to this jump . a fabrication of the ferromagnet smaller than the exchange length ( typically @xcite , on the order of 10 nm ) is an unavoidable and indispensable challenge for both fundamental physics and practical applications .",
    "in such nanostructure , the magnetization dynamics is well described by the macrospin model .",
    "therefore , it is important to clarify the magnetization reversal mechanism , such as the origin of the jump of the reversal field , using the macrospin model .",
    "the purposes of this paper are to explain why a large field is required to reverse the magnetization in the high - frequency region in mamr and to derive equations that determine the reversal field in both the low- and high - frequency regions without the time - dependent solution of the macrospin llg equation .",
    "it is pointed out that the rotating field not only energetically stabilizes the reversed state but also produces a torque acting on the magnetization .",
    "we find that this torque , whose strength is proportional to the frequency of the rotating field , prevents the reversal , causing the reversal field to become relatively large in the high - frequency region .",
    "the direction of this preventing torque is expressed by the triple vector product , analogous to the spin torque @xcite .",
    "this fact motivates us to use the energy balance equation for the estimation of the reversal field of mamr , which was recently pointed out to be useful for estimating the reversal current in the spin - torque reversal problem @xcite but has been never applied to the mamr problem .",
    "the equations determining the reversal field , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : condition_low ] ) and ( [ eq : condition_high ] ) , are derived for both the low- and high - frequency regions from the energy balance equation .",
    "these formulas show that the reversal field in the low - frequency region converges to eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition_low_zero_damping ] ) as the damping constant decreases , while the reversal field in the high - frequency region is independent of the damping constant .",
    "the boundary between the low- and high - frequency regions is also estimated from the energy balance equation .",

    "on the other hand , bertotti _ et al .",
    "_ considered the instability of the magnetization around the steady point corresponding to the stable or saddle point . in this case , a relatively large energy compared with our situation is required to overcome the potential barrier and reverse the magnetization direction .",
    "therefore , the reversal field estimated from the method of bertotti _ et al . _ becomes larger than our estimation .",
    "we emphasize that both the results of bertotti _ et al . _ and",
    "our method are useful to estimate the reversal field .",
    "for example , numerical simulation of the llg equation @xcite showed good agreement with the theory of bertotti _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the magnitude of the dc magnetic field is linearly increased with time until it reaches a certain value . in this case",
    ", the magnetization first relaxes to a stable point of the potential , and after that the magnetization reverses its direction when the saturated value of the dc magnetic field is larger than the reversal field estimated by the method of bertotti _ et al .",
    "_ on the other hand , our approach is applicable when the magnitude of the dc magnetic field is fixed from @xmath18 , as mentioned above . to clarify the applicability of the theory of bertotti _ et al .",
    "_ more precisely , an estimation of relaxation time from the initial state to the steady point , which should be shorter than the time to saturate the dc magnetic field magnitude , will be necessary .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the dependence of the reversal field in microwave - assisted magnetization reversal on the frequency of the rotating field theoretically .",
    "the microwave produced a dc magnetic field pointing in the reversed direction , which energetically stabilized the reversed state .",
    "the microwave simultaneously produced a torque proportional to the frequency of the rotating field .",
    "because this torque prevented the reversal , a large field was required to reverse the magnetization in the high - frequency region .",
    "the equations determining the reversal fields in both the low- and high - frequency regions were derived from the energy balance equation .",
    "the formulas showed that the reversal field in the low - frequency region became converged to eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition_low_zero_damping ] ) as the damping constant decreased , while the reversal field in the high - frequency region was independent of the damping constant .",
    "the boundary between the low- and high - frequency regions , which was independent of the damping constant , was also estimated from the energy balance equation .",
    "the comparison with the numerical solution of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation showed quantitatively good agreement , guaranteeing the validities of the formula .",

    "the transformation from the laboratory frame to the rotating frame is described by the rotation matrix , @xmath130 for example , the relation between @xmath14 and @xmath67 is given by @xmath131 .",

    "[ sec : reversal in low frequency region ] and [ sec : reversal in high frequency region ] , a potential map is useful to investigate the magnetization dynamics .",

    "( [ eq : condition_low ] ) and ( [ eq : condition_high ] ) are still applicable to estimate the reversal fields in the low- and high - frequency regions , respectively , because the explicit forms of @xmath35 and @xmath36 do not affect the derivation of these equations .",
    "equation ( [ eq : condition_boundary ] ) is also applicable to determine the boundary between the low- and high - frequency regions .",
    "however , the argument that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : condition_boundary ] ) and ( [ eq : condition_high ] ) are independent of the damping constant does not necessarily hold .",
