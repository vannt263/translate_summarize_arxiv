    "an increasingly large number of investigations has recognized the importance of dwarf spheroidal galaxies for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution ( see mateo @xcite and da costa @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "while new studies of the central , densest regions of the more distant local group galaxies have benefited from the exceptional resolution of hst , the nearby dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way can still be investigated in great detail using ground based wide - field data .",
    "thanks to recent improvements in detector efficiency ( in particular , in the blue part of the optical spectrum ) and size , cmd s with long color baselines and high statistical significance can be obtained in affordable exposure times .",
    "the fornax dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy represents one of the most interesting cases for studying the complexity of stellar populations in dwarf galaxies .",
    "this galaxy was one of the first dsph in which an intermediate age population was detected .",
    "the presence of upper asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , brighter and redder than the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , indicated that about @xmath16  of the galaxy could be of intermediate age ( 2 to 8  gyr ) ( aaronson & mould @xcite , @xcite ) . surveys for agb stars led to discovery of 111 carbon stars , for which follow up near - infrared photometry indicated a wide range of bolometric luminosities , a mass dispersion among the progenitors , and hence an age spread ( frogel et al .",

    ", an hst study of a central fornax field sampling the main - sequence turnoffs of the intermediate - age and old populations has been carried out by buonanno et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the resulting cmd has shown evidence for a star formation starting about 12 gyr ago and continuing until 0.5 gyr ago .",
    "a variable star formation rate is revealed by gaps between separate subgiant branches , and major star formation episodes probably occurred nearly 2.5 , 4 , and 7 gyr ago .",
    "also , fornax certainly harbors an old stellar population , since it contains five globular clusters whose ages do not differ from those of m68 and m92 ( buonanno et al .",
    "@xcite ; smith et al .",
    "@xcite ) , except perhaps for cluster  4 that appears to be 2 - 3 gyr younger ( buonanno et al .",
    "@xcite ) . these clusters have unusually red horizontal branches for their low metallicity , with no counterparts in the outer galactic halo or the magellanic clouds . also for cluster 4 , the recent wfpc2 color - magnitude diagrams of buonanno et al .",
    "( @xcite ) unambiguously indicate a low metallicity , [ fe / h]@xmath17 , although integrated spectra pointed to a metallicity similar to that of field stars ( beauchamp et al .",
    "an old population is present among the field stars of fornax as well , as demonstrated by detection of a red horizontal branch slightly fainter than the red clump , and of rr lyrae variables ( buonanno et al .",
    "@xcite ; stetson et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter shs98 ) .",
    "fornax also hosts a significant population of young stars .",

    "( @xcite ) had already noticed a handful of faint blue stars in their cmd  of the fornax field , tentatively explained as belonging to a @xmath18  yr population ( cf .",
    "also gratton et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the deeper cmd  of beauchamp et al .",
    "( @xcite ) clearly revealed a young main - sequence , and comparison with theoretical isochrones indicated recent star formation .",
    "the brightest turnoff was located at @xmath19 , implying a minimum age of @xmath20  yr .",
    "this young population is best shown by the recent wide - area survey of shs98 .",
    "notwithstanding this young stellar component , fornax appears to be devoid of any interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "a large - area search for neutral hydrogen has given no detectable hi  emission or absorption ( young @xcite ) , the upper limit for hi   emission being @xmath21  @xmath22  at the galaxy center .",
    "thus the interstellar medium that must have been present a few @xmath23  yr ago to form stars , appears to be all gone .",
    "there is also the possibility that the ism has been ionized and heated up by the interstellar uv field .",
    "however , this hypothesis conflicts with the lack of detection of x - ray emission in the direction of fornax ( gizis et al .",
    "the various stellar subpopulations in fornax have different spatial distributions , which have been carefully investigated by shs98 .",
    "the oldest population , represented by the rr  lyrae variables , has the most extended distribution .",
    "the intermediate - age stars ( red clump stars ) are more centrally concentrated , while the young population of blue ms stars , as well the reddest agb ( carbon ) stars , are even more concentrated in a bar - like distribution roughly aligned in the ew direction , with the brightest stars located at the ends of the bar .",
    "also the red clump population displays an asymmetrical structure ( cf .",
    "hodge @xcite ; eskridge @xcite ; demers et al .",
    "@xcite ) , with a peculiar `` crescent '' shape ( shs98 ) .",
    "despite all these pieces of knowledge accumulated in recent years , the star formation history of fornax is not yet fully understood .",
    "several questions need to be answered before a reconstruction of the star formation and chemical enrichment history of fornax can be attempted .",
    "the metallicity should be measured for stellar populations of different age and location within the galaxy , so as to determine the run of metal enrichment as a function of time .",
    "the star formation history needs to be evaluated using critical features in the cmd  as tracers of star formation at different epochs , to understand to what extent star formation proceeded continuously or in bursts , and how it propagated throughout the body of the galaxy .",
    "the nature of the wide red giant branch ( rgb ) is still quite puzzling , though all previous investigations agree on the fact that it is broader than expected on the basis of the photometric errors .",
    "further , there is a lack of observational data with which to study features such as the rgb and agb bumps or the precise location of central helium - burning stars as a function of age and metal abundance , as a test of stellar evolution models .",
    "large field observations of local group dsph galaxies , being able to sample a significant number of stars , can address these issues .    with these open questions in mind ,",
    "we have investigated the stellar populations of fornax as part of a wide - field study of nearby dwarf spheroidals .",
    "we present here a large area @xmath24  photometric study of the fornax field , yielding magnitudes and colors for about 40,000 stars down to @xmath25  mag below the horizontal branch , in four regions located at different distances from the galaxy center .",
    "the use of standard passbands , together with the size of our stellar sample , allowed us to derive the basic physical properties of fornax with high accuracy and measure details in its cmd  that trace the less numerous populations and faster evolutionary phases .    in particular , the @xmath26  band turned out to be invaluable for studying the hot stars , be they old or young , whereas the wide baseline of the @xmath9  color provides the best resolution of the different evolutionary phases in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cf .",

    "evolutionary phases that gave barely discernible features in small field observations are easily measurable in our color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "we could reliably measure the agb bump , a small clump produced by a clustering of stars at the base of the agb , at @xmath6 .",
    "measurements of such minor evolutionary features may provide useful tests of stellar models for stars of different masses and metallicities .",
    "the sharp cutoff in the luminosity function of fornax has been used to estimate its distance using the rgb tip method .",
    "the corrected distance modulus of fornax , @xmath114 , agrees with previous determinations .",
    "this estimate is confirmed by the mean level of old horizontal - branch stars . by measuring the average magnitude of the red hb ( distinct from the red clump ) we estimated a distance modulus @xmath193  on the distance scale of lee et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "fornax , as many other dsph , has been known for a long time to have a wide rgb color distribution .",
    "the `` color scatter '' has been usually taken to represent an abundance spread .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the color distribution of the red giant stars across the fiducial line , and found that it is reasonably well fitted by a two - component model .",
    "this approximately bimodal distribution is remarkably similar in all fields . about 70% of the red giants belong to an intermediate - age rgb component which is itself wider than expected from instrumental errors . by comparing the bulk of the fornax rgb with the ridge lines of standard globular clusters ,",
    "we have estimated a mean metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath194 .",
    "this nominal value should be corrected for the age difference between the fornax population and the milky way globulars .",
    "accounting for an age difference of 10 gyr , we find an _ age - corrected _ mean metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath195 for the dominant intermediate - age population of fornax .",
    "interestingly , this is also the metallicity found for sagittarius , the nearest milky way dsph satellite that has luminosity comparable to that of fornax .",
    "the _ intrinsic _ color scatter of stars in the rgb main component is @xmath196  mag implying a relatively modest metallicity spread @xmath14 } = 0.12 \\pm 0.02 $ ]  dex .",
    "then the ( @xmath144 ) metallicity range for the bulk population of fornax is @xmath181 } < -0.75 $ ]  if a correction for the mean age is applied .",
    "the secondary component or `` bluer tail '' is also quite broad . in principle",
    ", these bluer stars could be either young or old and metal - poor .",
    "star counts of different subpopulations at various locations confirm and extend the evidence for radial population gradients emerged in previous studies .",
    "recent star formation is clearly concentrated in the central regions , though with some degree of asymmetry ( e.g. ,  shs98 ) .",
    "old stars are more easily seen in the outer fields .",
    "a blue hb population can be noticed in our outermost field , coming from the minority old , metal - poor field component . the stars populating the blue side of the wide rgb closely follow the spatial distribution of the old - hb stars .",
    "this is perhaps our most important finding , since it demonstrates that the bluer rgb stars are themselves old and metal- poor , and clearly establishes the nature of the wide rgb of fornax .",
    "thus the roughly bimodal color distribution can be interpreted as a metallicity distribution , implying that the bulk of the fornax galaxy was built during two rather distinct star - forming epochs .",
    "the older population has [ fe / h]@xmath197  dex with ( @xmath101 ) and an wide abundance range @xmath198 } < -1.4 $ ] .",
    "the emerging picture is one in which the evolution of fornax is characterized by two major star formation epochs , each consisting of many episodes .",
    "the first episode took place at an early epoch , being presumably coeval to the birth of the old galactic globular clusters , from metal - poor gas .",
    "after a relatively quiescent period , fornax formed the bulk of stellar populations between 7 and 2.5 gyr ago from the pre - enriched gas .",
    "star formation continued at a lower rate in the central regions until as recently as 10@xmath199  yr ago .",
    "the modest internal abundance spread found in each main population seen in the metallicity distribution , and the different metallicities of populations of different age , trace the progressive metal enrichment and represent the basis for an age - metallicity relation in fornax .",
    "the constraints found in this paper provide the physical input for a quantitative analysis of the star formation and chemical enrichment history of fornax , which will be done in a forthcoming study using the methods of stellar population synthesis .",
