    "# 1@xmath2 # 1#2@xmath2#2 ;    there are strong evidences that the universe is spatially flat and accelerating at the present time @xcite . in the context of friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology",
    ", this acceleration is attributed to the domination of a component , dubbed dark energy . the simplest candidate for",
    "the dark energy seems to be a remnant small cosmological constant or ( true or false ) vacuum energy , but it suffers from the difficulties associated with the fine tuning and coincidence problem , so many physicists are attracted with the idea that the acceleration is driven by dynamical scalar fields , such as quintessence@xcite .    despite the current theoretical ambiguity for the nature of dark energy , the prosperous observational data ( _ e.g. _ supernova , cmb and large scale structure data and so on ) have opened a robust window for testing the recent and even early behavior of dark energy using some parameterizations for its equation of state .",
    "the recent fits to current supernova(sn ) ia data in the literature find that even though the behavior of dark energy is to great extent in consistency with a cosmological constant , an evolving dark energy with the equation of state @xmath3 larger than -1 in the recent past but less than -1 today is mildly favored@xcite .",
    "if such a result holds on with the accumulation of observational data , this would be a great challenge to current cosmology .",
    "firstly , the cosmological constant as a candidate for dark energy will be excluded and dark energy must be dynamical . secondly , the simple dynamical dark energy models considered vastly in the literature like the quintessence@xcite or the phantom@xcite can not be satisfied either .    in the quintessence model ,",
    "the energy density and the pressure for the quintessence field are @xmath4 so , its equation of state @xmath5 is in the range @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "however , for the phantom which has the opposite sign of the kinetic term compared with the quintessence in the lagrangian , @xmath8 the equation of state @xmath9 is located in the range of @xmath10 .",
    "neither the quintessence nor the phantom alone can fulfill the transition from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and vice versa .    in ref.@xcite",
    "we have proposed a new scenario of the dark energy , dubbed _",
    "quintom_. a simple quintom model consists of two scalar fields , one being the quintessence with the other being the phantom field .",
    "this type of quintom model will provide a scenario where at early time the quintessence dominates with @xmath11 and lately the phantom dominates with @xmath3 less than @xmath13 , satisfying current observations@xcite . a detailed study on the cosmological evolution of this class of quintom model",
    "is performed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the quintom models are different from the quintessence or phantom in the determination of the evolution and fate of the universe . generically speaking",
    ", the phantom model has to be more fine tuned in the early epochs to serve as dark energy today , since its energy density increases with expansion of the universe .",
    "meanwhile the quintom model can also preserve the tracking behavior of quintessence , where less fine tuning is needed .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have studied a class of quintom models with an oscillating equation of state and found that oscillating quintom can unify the early inflation and current acceleration of the universe , leading to oscillations of the hubble constant and a recurring universe .",
    "our oscillating quintom would not lead to a big crunch nor big rip .",
    "the scale factor keeps increasing from one period to another and leads naturally to a highly flat universe .",
    "the universe in this model recurs itself and we are only staying among one of the epochs , in which sense the coincidence problem is reconciled . in this paper",
    "we study the current observational constraints on the model of oscillating quintom .",
    "specifically we consider a variation of the model in ref.@xcite with an equation of state given by @xmath14 the model above has two parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 and for low redshifts it reduces to @xmath17 which is commonly used in the literature for the linear parameterization of the dark energy . at large redshifts",
    "the @xmath3 of our model oscillates and will differ substantially from the model with linear parameterization , which is the key as we will show below to evade the constraints from the high redshifts observational data .",
    "we use the `` gold '' set of 157 sn ia data published by riess in @xcite in fitting to supernova .",
    "we assume a flat space and use a uniform prior on the matter density fraction of the universe : @xmath18 .",
    "we constrain the hubble parameter to be uniformly in @xmath19 hst region : @xmath20 .    in a flat universe ,",
    "the luminosity distance can be expressed as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23^{1/2 } = h(z)/h_0~,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and the label of `` x '' stands for dark energy . as an illustrative effect we use similar fitting methods by refs.@xcite .",
    "for the cosmic microwave background(cmb ) fitting we use here only the cmb shift parameter @xcite , @xmath25 as in ref.@xcite where @xmath26 .",
    "the large scale structure(lss ) information we use is the linear growth rate @xmath27 measured by the 2df survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the linear growth factor and the density perturbation equation of @xmath31 evolutes as @xmath32 .                in",
    "we delineate sn ia , cmb and lss constraints on the oscillating dark energy model .",
    "we can find a large parameter space is allowed by current supernova data while additional constraints from cmb @xmath39 parameter and linear growth rate of 2df have restricted considerably the parameters within a lower region .",
    "we plot the corresponding one dimensional likelihood of @xmath16 in .",
    "an oscillating quintom model seems to be mildly favored at 1@xmath40 .",
    "the best fit value for the sn ia @xmath35 cmb @xmath35 lss of our oscillating model is @xmath36 . in",
    "we show the corresponding @xmath41 . as @xmath39 contains the contribution of @xmath42 on all relevant scales as an integration , @xmath16",
    "is somewhat constrained , this has also reflected the weak correlation of our parameterization .",
    "when lss constraint is also taken into account we find although the shape of the parameter space is not changed , the best fit parameter has a lower @xmath16 compared with sn ia and cmb constraints . in the upper panel",
    "of we find that the linear growth factor deviates reasonably from a constant @xmath15 case in low redshift .",
    "we should point out in our simple two parameter expansion the period of oscillation is fixed , which is due to the simplification of our parameterization .    before concluding we compare our model in ( 3 ) with the linearly parameterized dark energy model in ( 4 ) . in",
    "we show the sn ia and cmb constraints on linear parameterized dark energy model in ( 4 ) . comparing and",
    "one can see the similarity for the linear and oscillating models when considering only the supernova data .",
    "this is understandable since our model in ( 3 ) for low redshifts reduces to the one in ( 4 ) , however when including the high redshift observational data such as cmb the difference is significant . to understand these",
    "firstly we show in the maximum difference of @xmath43 of the two dark energy models up to @xmath44 , where only 9 sn ia of the gold sample lie outside the range , the maximum difference is no more than @xmath45 . in the calculations we have set @xmath46 and @xmath47 as an example .",
    "the maximum difference is considerably small and the parameter spaces are expected to be similar for the two models under supernova constraints .",
    "meanwhile as from we also expect @xmath48 for the oscillating case , in the early epoch as @xmath49 the contribution of @xmath16 term to @xmath42 would be cancelled due to averaging over the oscillating periods , as can be seen from . in",
    "we have shown the ratio of density with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , assuming @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the same background parameters as .",
    "we can see the ratio is a constant in the early epochs .",
    "dark energy would hence be negligible on large redshifts compared with matter energy density and the @xmath39 parameter of cmb would not give very strong constraints on the oscillating dark energy .",
    "when cmb is considered in the linear parameterization of the equation of state the upper limit shrinks promptly to near zero .",
    "this is because that @xmath54 would blow up for a sizable positive @xmath16 on large redshifts and hence cmb has restricted the model parameter @xmath16 much stronger than supernova .    in summary",
    "we in this paper have considered a simple two - parameter model of oscillating quintom .",
    "the oscillating equation of state resemble itself similar to the linear parameterized dark energy in low redshift , meanwhile the oscillating feature of the model make it possible to evade the constraints from cmb observations .",
    "our results indicate that a dynamical model of dark energy such as the oscillating quintom proposed in this paper is mildly favored under current observations .",
    "our analysis here can be generalized into different quintom model with an oscillating equation of state as a function of scale factor @xmath55 for example @xmath56 which becomes the one proposed by refs.@xcite for small @xmath57 .",
