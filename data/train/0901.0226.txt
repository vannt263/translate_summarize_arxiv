    "one of the most unexpected , and as yet unexplained , experimental results found at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) concerns the description of particle interferometry observables @xcite .",
    "it was originally expected that the deconfined matter would be a highly viscous , weakly interacting quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "thus , ideal hydrodynamics would not provide a good description of flow observables sensitive to the early stages of the collision , such as azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "the signature of choice of a phase transition from hydrodynamics models , one less sensitive to viscosity , was to be an increase of the `` out '' to `` side '' emission radius ratio ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 , see fig .",
    "[ hbtstinks ] center panel ) due to longer lifetime of the system , caused by the softening of the equation of state in the transition / crossover region @xcite .    the data , however , exhibited an opposite behaviour .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations provided a good description of transverse momentum spectra and their azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "the same simulations , however , failed to describe hbt data @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most surpising aspect of the problem is the _ way _ in which the data does not fit : measured parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are nearly identical .",
    "[ hbtstinks ] left and right panel ) their ( positive ) difference @xmath4 is thought to depend on the duration of particle emission .",
    "hence , it looks like the fireball emits particles almost instantaneously and does not show any sign of phase transition or crossover .",
    "hydrodynamics , with `` reasonable '' freeze - out condition ( such as a freeze - out temperature of 100 mev or so ) can not describe this even qualitatively .",
    "this behaviour , when compared to lower energy data , exhibits remarkably good scaling with multiplicity ( fig .",
    "[ hbtstinks ] left panel ) .",
    "the scaling s _ existance _ , however , is by itself surprising since the qcd equation of state , with it s critical density for a phase transition , should break it .",
    "there could be three possible approaches to the hbt puzzle .",
    "it could be that the system is simply too complicated , and that once we include all possible improvements ( full 3d calculation , viscosity , hadronic kinetic afterburner , in - medium hadron modifications , pre - existing flow etc . )",
    ", everything will fit .",
    "it could also be that we are drastically misunderstanding the data , and the hbt puzzle is a symptom of inapplicability of hydrodynamics to heavy ion collisions .",
    "finally , it could be that the hydrodynamic approach is basically correct , but just one element of relevant physics is omitted @xcite .",
    "the second possibility is unlikely because , in some ways , hydrodynamic prescription _ does _ fit hbt data .",
    "scaling of hbt radii with the multiplicity rapidity density @xmath5 , over a large range of energies @xcite is typical for an isentropically expanding fluid that suddenly breaks apart .",
    "in addition , the good description , within parameters compatible with what is needed to describe flow , of the _ azimuthal _ dependence of hbt radii @xcite , also suggests that the hydrodynamic framework is a good ansatz for describing the matter produced in heavy ion collisions _ up to",
    "freeze - out_.    the first possibility also appears problematic : successful models and/or parametrisations of the freeze - out which describe hbt radii are found in the literature @xcite , and they could provide a way to gain insights into what is missing .",
    "however , we feel that successful description involves a dynamical description from initial conditions _ plus a freeze - out criterion _ , rather than a fit to data with assumptions put in `` by hand '' .",
    "such a description is so far lacking .",
    "furthermore , the most plausible refinements to hydrodynamics , namely implementation of fully three - dimensional models and the addition of a kinetic theory afterburner @xcite do not do anything to solve the hbt discrepancy , suggesting that the problem is not refinements but rather one large missed physical effect",
    "the bulk viscosity of high temperature strongly interacting matter has recently been calculated using perturbative qcd @xcite , and found to be negligible , both in comparison to shear viscosity and w.r.t . its effect on any reasonable collective evolution of the system .",
    "this is not surprising : the qcd lagrangian , as long as no `` heavy '' quarks are present , is nearly conformally invariant @xcite .",
    "since , within a fluid , the violation of conformal symmetry is linearly proportional to a bulk viscosity term , the near conformal invariance of the qcd lagrangian should guarantee that bulk viscosity is nearly zero , _ in the perturbative regime_. in the hadron gas phase , the numerous scales associated with hadrons render conformal invariance a bad symmetry , and hence it is natural that bulk viscosity not be negligible .",
    "this is , again , rooted in a fundamental feature of qcd : the non - perturbative _ conformal anomaly _ , that manifests itself in the scale ( usually called @xmath7 ) at which the qcd coupling constant stops being small enough for the perturbative expansion to make sense .",
    "this scale coincides with the scale at which confining forces hold hadrons together .",
    "this violation of conformal invariance is not seen perturbatively , but should dominate over the perturbatively calculated bulk viscosity as temperature drops close enough to the qcd phase transition . what happens to _ bulk _ viscosity in this regime , where hadrons are not yet formed ,",
    "presumably the matter is still deconfined , but conformal symmetry is badly broken ? there is a quenched lattice calculation , and compelling physical arguments @xcite that bulk viscosity rises sharply , or even diverges , close to the phase transition temperature .",
    "lattice simulations find that @xmath8 ( = 0 for a conformally invariant system ) , increases rapidly close to @xmath6 .",
    "remembering that the shear ( @xmath9 ) and bulk ( @xmath10 ) viscosities roughly scale as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 refers to the equilibration timescale of ( ine)elastic collisions .",
    "finite temperature sum rules in conjunction with lattice data @xcite give a sharp rise in bulk viscosity .",
    "the rise is , in fact , likely to be considerably sharper than @xcite suggests .",
    "the dependence of @xmath13 on temperature can be guessed from the fact that , at @xmath6 , the quark condensate @xmath14 acquires a finite value , and the gluon condensate @xmath15 sharply increases at the phase transition .",
    "`` kinetically '' , therefore , timescales of processes that create extra @xmath16 and @xmath17 pairs should diverge close to the phase transition temperature , by analogy with the divergence of the spin correlation length in the ising model close to the phase transition .",
    "the sharp rise of bulk viscosity can also be understood within string kinetics : confinement , microscopically , can be thought of as a `` string tension '' appearing in the potential . even in a regime where the momentum exchange of the average collision is more than enough to break the string , and the relevant degrees of freedom",
    "are still quarks , not mesons , string tension introduces a huge change in kinetics : what were elastic collision without string tension , become inelastic onece string tension appears . even if the energy needed to break the string is low , over many collisions , the heat energy would be converted into creating more slightly colder , less pressing particles . that s exactly the kind of processes that contribute most to bulk viscosity @xcite .    these arguments give evidence to the conjecture that , close ( from above ) to @xmath6 , bulk viscosity goes rapidly from a negligible value to a value capable of _ dominating _ the collective evolution of the system . for our analysis , we assume the bulk viscosity to be of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite . at @xmath22 ,",
    "this ansatz provides a reasonable fit to the results of @xcite , considering the peak height and width of the distribution are still unknown .",
    "to study the effect of our conjectured behaviour of bulk viscosity on solutions to hydrodynamics , we perform a stability analysis @xcite of a boost - invariant solution to the navier - stokes equations ( both the 1d and 3d cases ) .",
    "the navier - stokes equations with boost - invariant symmetry @xcite can be rewritten in terms of the reynolds number @xmath23 , the entropy @xmath24 the co - moving time @xmath25 , the total number ( @xmath26 ) of dimensions , and the dimensionality of the homogeneous expansion ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 corresponds to bjorken hydrodynamics @xcite , @xmath31 to a homogeneus 3d expansion .",
    "the reynolds number is a function of temperature @xmath32 , bulk and shear viscosity @xmath10 and @xmath9 and entropy density @xmath24 : @xmath33 . with given expressions for @xmath34 ,",
    "this set of equations becomes closed and solvable .",
    "for the equation of state , we use a parameterization of lattice data ( we have checked that our results do not vary qualitatively if the ideal eos is used ) .",
    "we follow the stability analysis performed in @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of a generic perturbation to the 1d boost - invariant system is a vector @xmath35 in the two dimensional space of entropy perturbations and flow ( rapidity @xmath36 ) perturbations , and its frequency in rapidity can be decomposed into fourier components @xmath37 the equation of motion for @xmath35 will then be given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a real matrix function of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we refer the reader to eq .",
    "4.23 - 4.26 of @xcite for the full form of @xmath39 .",
    "the system s stability can be understood via the behavior of the modulus of @xmath35 , @xmath42 @xmath43 since @xmath44 is real and symmetric , it will always have two real eigenvalues , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( corresponding eigenvectors @xmath47 ) , as well as orthogonal matrices @xmath48 diagonalizing it .",
    "defining @xmath49we see that @xmath50 thus , if @xmath51 , the system is unstable , since perturbation in any direction will produce a positive growth rate",
    ". an instability will grow as a power - law with @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the starting time of the perturbation @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath55 , on the other hand , the system will be stable against perturbations , an instability will be suppressed as @xmath56 .    if @xmath57 and @xmath58 some modes will be stable and some will be unstable . in the latter case , the time dependence of @xmath59 will in general",
    "continuously rotate @xmath60 and @xmath61 in time , stopping the growth of the instability : since @xmath59 is time - dependant , @xmath62 might be in the direction of @xmath63 a short time later .",
    "solving eq .",
    "[ perturbeq ] will take this effect into account .    in what follows , we use @xmath64 @xmath6 and",
    "evolve the system from an initial temperature @xmath65 gev and comoving time 0.6 @xmath66 .",
    "note that the qualitative features of our study are independent of the details of the evolution before @xmath6 , such as the initial temperature and timescale .",
    "figure [ allplots ] ( upper panel ) shows the temperature , entropy density and total entropy in the central rapidity unit as a function of time .",
    "as soon as @xmath67 becomes non - negligible ( i.e. viscous forces dominate around @xmath6 ) , the kinematic evolution of the system `` freezes '' .",
    "the system then stays at nearly constant temperature , through it keeps producing more and more entropy at the expense of advective energy . at first sight ,",
    "large values of @xmath67 are excluded by hbt data and multiplicity measurements .",
    "however , we will show that this long phase is unstable against small perturbations .",
    "thus , its further evolution will not be given by the background solution , but by a rapid formation of local inhomogeneities .",
    "figure [ allplots ] ( second panel ) shows the @xmath46 and @xmath45 eigenvalues corresponding to representative @xmath68 ( other values of @xmath41 were checked not to vary significantly wrt those presented here ) . as can be seen , the peak in bulk viscosity forces the growing / damping rates to increase rapidly .",
    "thus , any initial perturbation in the unstable direction will rapidly grow to a value comparable with the background , unless the system s evolution will stop the growth by rotating the direction of the unstable modes .",
    "figure [ allplots ] ( third panel ) examines whether this occurs for larger values of @xmath67 .",
    "if the peak of viscosity is negligible , the unstable eigenvector keeps rotating throughout the evolution of the system .",
    "thus , even an unstable mode s growth will very quickly stop growing since the dynamics will turn it into a damped mode .",
    "when @xmath67 dominates , however , when @xmath32 approaches @xmath6 , the direction of the unstable modes experiences an abrupt rotation",
    ". then it stays constant throughout the time the system travels through the viscosity peak ( this time increases strongly as @xmath67 increases ) , and gets rotated again as the peak is passed .",
    "the reason for this behavior is clear from the `` freeze '' of the background evolution in the top panel .",
    "thus , at large @xmath67 unstable modes have all the required time to grow",
    ".    finally , fig .",
    "[ allplots ] ( bottom panel ) shows the explicit solution of eq .",
    "[ perturbeq ] . at each time - step , a perturbation is born in the unstable eigenvector mode , and then evolved until the end of the evolution of the system .",
    "the plot shows @xmath69 , the ratio of strength of the perturbation to the initial strength as a function of time ( note that the starting value is always unity ) .",
    "a large @xmath70 does not mean the evolution equation is invalid : for any point in the graph , there will be a small enough perturbation amplitude that survives as a perturbation in the subsequent evolution .",
    "the probability of a _ larger _",
    "perturbation forming and significantly modifying the background , however , should grow strongly with @xmath67 .",
    "it is clear that any microscopic mechanism seeding instabilities at the scale @xmath71,uniformly distributed in @xmath35 and at a rate of @xmath72 is likely to generate power - law growing instabilities a few @xmath66 after @xmath73 .",
    "these instabilities should reach @xmath74 , and hence play an important role in the subsequent evolution of the system , a few @xmath66 after that .",
    "the resulting scenario is phenomenologically similar to the fragmenting induced by supercooling in a first order transition @xcite , but originating from hydrodynamic rather than thermodyamic instabilities .",
    "we do not expect second order hydrodynamics @xcite to play a big role in _ starting _ the instabilities : as argued in @xcite , as long as the system s expansion rate as the system approaches @xmath6 is smaller than the relaxation time @xmath75 , @xmath76 second order terms will not prevent viscous corrections to the pressure of the order of @xmath77 , but merely localize their propagation .",
    "the ( admittedly unreliable ) estimates from strongly coupled cft @xcite suggest that this criterion is amply satisfied , especially considering that the increase in viscosity causes the background solution to slow down over a timescale much bigger than @xmath78 .",
    "second order hydrodynamics might however play a dominant role in stopping the instabilities once they grow to a value comparable to the background .",
    "recent numerical simulations , with israel - stewart hydrodynamics , provide evidence that this description is true , as cluster - like instabilities seem to be present ( fig . 11 of @xcite )",
    "hbt radii are directly related to the system s spacetime correlation tensor @xcite ( `` long '' ) is the z direction ( parallel to the beam ) , @xmath79 ( `` out '' ) is the direction of the pair momentum , and @xmath24 ( `` side '' ) is the cross product of the previous two .",
    "averaging is done over the emission function @xmath80 , the probability of producing a particle of momentum @xmath81 at @xmath82 .",
    "see @xcite for details ] @xmath83 while @xmath84 is simply given by @xmath85 . here",
    "the @xmath86 is the sum of the two four - momenta of the pion pair .",
    "as remarked in @xcite , the @xmath87 result is not easy to reconcile with naive hydrodynamics plus a straight - forward ( critical temperature ) emission for several reasons ;    firstly , the higher the energy , the longer the emission time , the larger is the expected discrepancy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "if the system starts close to the mixed phase , the timescale of freezing out should be longer still due to the softest point in the equation of state .",
    "hence , a generic prediction from eq . ( [ rout ] )",
    "is that @xmath88 , largely increases with energy , and exhibits a peak when the energy density is such that the system starts within , or slightly above the mixed phase .",
    "this is in direct contrast with experimental data , where @xmath89 is a feature at all reaction energies .",
    "secondly , generally @xmath90 , since particles on the outer layer freeze - out first .",
    "this increases @xmath91 further ( cf .",
    "eq  [ rout ] ) .",
    "time dilation due to transverse flow does reverse this dependence @xcite .",
    "fragmentation of the bulk could help solving these problems .",
    "firstly , fragment size , density and decay timescale , is approximately independent of either reaction energy or centrality .",
    "hence , the near energy independence of the ( comparatively short ) emission timescale , and hence of @xmath92 , should be recovered . secondly ,",
    "if the decay products do not interact ( or do not interact much ) after fragment decay , it can also be seen that @xmath93 can indeed be positive : outward fragments are moving faster , resulting in time dilation .",
    "this effect can be offset by time dilation of fragment decay by increasing the temperature at which fragments form , or by increasing fragment size .",
    "recovering the linear scaling of the radii with @xmath94 @xcite , while maintaining the correct @xmath92 is also possible if the fragments decay when their distance w.r.t .",
    "each other is still comparable to their intrinsic size .",
    "the bulk - viscosity - driven freeze - out adds another parameter to ab initio hbt calculations : in addition to critical temperature / energy density , we now have the fragment size . to see whether this helps solving the hbt problem , output from hydrodynamics with a high ( @xmath73 ) freeze - out temperature should be fragmented into piecess with a certain distribution in size , which then produce hadrons according to the prescription in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced the hbt puzzle , and explained how bulk viscosity could help solve it by triggering the fragmenting of the system close to the critical temperature .",
    "we hope that , in the near future , this scenario will be developed to the point of experimental falsification .",
