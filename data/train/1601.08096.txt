    "rr lyrae stars are classical pulsating stars .",
    "they are known to pulsate mostly in radial fundamental mode ( rrab ) or in first overtone ( rrc ) . among rr lyrae stars",
    "there are also double - mode pulsators which pulsate in fundamental mode and first overtone simultaneously ( rrd , green asterisks in fig .  [ fig.pet ] ) or in fundamental mode and second overtone ( red triangles in fig .  [ fig.pet ] ) .",
    "the latter group was discovered mostly thanks to excellent space observations .",
    "observations also revealed a group of rr lyrae stars in which an additional non - radial mode is excited .",
    "these stars pulsate in a radial first overtone ( rrc or rrd stars ) and in an additional mode with shorter period , @xmath0 .",
    "period ratio of the additional mode to the first overtone is in the range of @xmath1 ( blue circles in fig .",
    "[ fig.pet ] ) .",
    "the most typical value is around 0.61 .",
    "such period ratio can not correspond to two radial modes @xcite .",
    "hence , the additional mode ( 0.61 mode in the following ) must be non - radial .",
    "this type of pulsations was discovered in 23 rr lyrae stars , based both on ground and on space observations ( for a summary see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and recently in 18 rr lyrae stars from m3 @xcite .",
    "this 0.61 mode has always very low amplitude in a milimagnitude regime .",
    "almost all stars observed with space telescopes showed this non - radial mode @xcite",
    ". low amplitude of this mode makes it very difficult to detect it in the ground - based observations .",
    "we decided to search for the 0.61 mode in rr lyrae stars of the galactic bulge observed by the ogle project @xcite .",
    "although quality of ground - based photometry is lower than of the space - based photometry , the number of observed stars is much higher in ground observations .        for the analysis we chose all stars available from the ogle - iii @xcite pulsating in first overtone .",
    "input sample consists of 4989 rrc stars and 91 rrd stars .",
    "rrc stars were analysed with an automatic method using dedicated software ( for details see * ? ? ? * ) and 91 rrd stars were analysed manually .",
    "it resulted in a detection of 147 stars with 0.61 mode ( @xmath2 of the sample ) .    in ogle - iv",
    "there are more than 10 000 rrc stars .",
    "because our analysis was focused on a search for low amplitude signals , we decided to choose only the most frequently observed stars .",
    "these are located in ogle fields 501 and 505 ( see position of observational fields in fig .  15 in * ? ? ?",
    "input sample consists of 485 rrc stars , which were analysed manually .",
    "the rest of stars observed during the fourth phase will be analysed automatically .",
    "we detected 131 rrc stars , from which 115 are new discoveries @xcite .",
    "with best quality data the 0.61 mode is found in @xmath3 of stars .",
    "we also detected another group of double - mode radial  non - radial rr lyrae stars ( magenta crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig.pet ] , * ? ? ?",
    "petersen diagram for multi - mode rr lyrae stars is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.pet ] .",
    "all known 0.61 stars are marked with blue circles .",
    "thanks to the ogle data we know altogether 303 0.61 stars , compared to 41 previously known .",
    "which such numerous sample we can see for the first time three sequences in the petersen diagram .",
    "the lowest sequence , around period ratio @xmath4 , is most populated .",
    "the highest sequence is less populated and is located around period ratio @xmath5 . between these two , there is a third sequence , least populated , but well separated from the other two ; it is clustered around period ratio @xmath6 .",
    "structures we detect in the power spectra of the stars are very broad ( see fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "in the time - domain it corresponds to variability of amplitude and phase of the signal .",
    "this behaviour of 0.61 mode is confirmed by other studies both from ground - based ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and space - based observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most exciting result is a discovery of stars which have three signals in the power spectrum corresponding to three sequences in the petersen diagram .",
    "power spectra of 6 such star are presented in fig .  5 in @xcite .",
    "+   +    another common property of 0.61 stars is occurence of subharmonics of the additional mode , both @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we detected signal at subhamonic frequency in 26 stars , which constitute @xmath9 of the ogle - iv 0.61 stars .",
    "additional modes and their subharmonic are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.subharm ] for selected stars ( see also fig .  11 in * ? ? ?",
    "structures of subharmonics are very complex .",
    "they appear in power spectra as wide bands of excess power . before our analysis of the ogle data ,",
    "subharmonics were detected only in space observations .",
    "typically , presence of subharmonic frequency indicates period doubling of the parent mode ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , there is another possibility proposed by dziembowski ( these proceedings ) .",
    "signal around @xmath7 can be a real mode present in a star , while signal at @xmath10 is its harmonic .     * and simultaneously * at around @xmath7 are marked).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "the majority of signals at subharmonic frequency range , @xmath11 , correspond to 0.63 sequence . in fig .",
    "[ fig.sh ] we present petersen diagram for 0.61 stars from ogle data .",
    "with red diamonds we marked stars for which signal at subharmonic is detected .",
