    "the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) method  @xcite was developed as an alternative to direct diagonalization in order to study low - energy nuclear properties .",
    "it was successfully applied to nuclear problems where large model spaces made diagonalization impractical . in the canonical smmc approach , one calculates the thermal expectation values of observables of few - body operators by representing the imaginary - time many - body evolution operator as a superposition of one - body propagators in fluctuating auxiliary fields .",
    "thus , one recasts the hamiltonian diagonalization problem as a stochastic integration problem .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the development of an smmc approach in the @xmath6-formalism .",
    "this implementation of smmc enables one to treat shell - model hamiltonians that are not isospin invariant in the model space , or for which different model spaces are used for protons and neutrons . in the following",
    ", we will use the abbreviated form smmcpn , to distinguish the approach discussed here from the original one .",
    "we note that special features of the pairing+quadrupole interaction enabled a special implementation of smmc in non - degenerate proton and neutron model spaces for calculations in rare earth nuclei @xcite .",
    "the method presented in this work is general and may be used for realistic hamiltonians , as well those of a more schematic variety .    as a first novel application of the new implementation , we perform shell - model calculations for the even - even @xmath4 and @xmath5 isotopic chains .",
    "initial experimental studies @xcite indicated that nuclei in this region have very large deformations , and that the transition from spherical shapes to highly deformed shapes occurs abruptly : @xmath7zr is rather spherical , while @xmath8zr nuclei are well deformed with a quadrupole deformation parameter of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spherical - to - deformed transition is more abrupt in the zr isotopes than in the nearby elements mo , ru , and pd .",
    "generator - coordinate mean - field calculations in this region @xcite are able to reproduce the shape transitions with particular skyrme interactions .",
    "furthermore , the region exhibits significant shape - coexistence phenomena @xcite .",
    "the history of shell - model applications in this mass region goes back to the 1960s with model spaces built on @xmath2 or @xmath10 cores  @xcite .",
    "gloeckner  @xcite used an effective interaction built on a @xmath2 core with a model space consisting of the orbitals @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",

    "holt _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite derived a realistic effective interaction using many - body perturbation techniques @xcite in the model space @xmath11 , @xmath13 .",
    "this effective interaction was based on the realistic nucleon - nucleon cd - bonn potential @xcite , and shell - model diagonalization calculations were carried out for the low - lying spectra of the zr isotopes with neutron numbers from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",

    "we discuss in the following how to implement number projection when the isospin quantum number is broken . note that in the limit of @xmath27 , we may evaluate ground - state properties of the nuclear systems .",
    "in the following , we will consider hamiltonians that have at most two - body terms .",
    "any such hamiltonian can be cast into a quadratic form :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the energy of single - particle level @xmath30 , and the operator @xmath31 is a a one - body density operator of the form @xmath32 .",

    "note that the monte carlo sign problem enters calculations when any of the @xmath71 matrix elements is positive .",
    "realistic shell - model interactions always have such terms ; a special case is the pairing - plus - quadrupole hamiltonian which has no sign problems .",
    "if the proton and neutron valence spaces are identical and the hamiltonian @xmath72 is isospin - symmetric , then the hamiltonian can be cast into a quadratic form which respects this symmetry explicitly . in that case , it is possible to form linear combinations of density operators that separately conserve the neutron and proton numbers . in the isospin formulation ( as done in the original smmc studies ) proton and neutron many - body wave functions are represented by slater determinants , and the ensuing one - body propagator factors into two propagators as well , one for protons and another for neutrons .",
    "the canonical traces are then calculated by applying the number - projection operator to obtain the desired proton and neutron numbers .",
    "in contrast , we will employ the shell - model monte carlo method to hamiltonians that are not necessarily isospin invariant or for which proton and neutron valence spaces are different .",
    "a relaxation of the isospin symmetry in the quadratic forms becomes essential in order to employ the smmc method in such cases . in the @xmath6-formalism",

    "( [ eq : w ] ) to obtain a positive definite weight will introduce a highly fluctuating integral .",
    "this will give rise to expectation values with very large fluctuations . in order to avoid this situation",

    "this situation is common among calculations using realistic interactions derived from @xmath116 scattering data @xcite .",
    "it may be related to the absence of real three - body forces in the construction of the effective interactions @xcite .",
    "it is known that a given hamiltonian can always be separated in the form @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the monopole part , while the multipole @xmath119 contains all other terms  @xcite .",
    "@xmath119 given by realistic @xmath116 interactions takes proper account of the configuration mixing ; however , the monopole part @xmath118 fails to produce the correct unperturbed energies .",
    "it is possible to change the averages of the so - called centroid matrix elements to fix this failure without affecting the spectrosopy to produce the correct binding energies  @xcite .",
    "however , a rigorous treatment of the global monopole corrections would deserve a detailed study and thus goes beyond the scope of the current work . instead , to give some substance to how a monopole correction may work , we add an overall constant to the diagonal interaction elements so that the modified matrix elements are given by @xmath120 where @xmath34 is the number of valence particles .",
    "we have adopted @xmath121 kev to reproduce the binding energy of @xmath122 .",
    "we plot the effect of this rather naive correction in fig .",
    "[ fig : bind ] , where modified results , represented by diamonds , show much better agreement for both chains of isotopes .",
    "since the @xmath123 state is expected to absorb most of the total @xmath3 strength , the latter can be used as a measure of the @xmath124 spacing , which should reflect a strong change with the shape transitions .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : be2 ] are the calculated total @xmath3 strengths ( open circles ) and available experimental  @xcite @xmath125 values ( filled circles ) .",
    "despite the fact that the calculated total strengths increase as expected in both isotope chains with the addition of neutrons , their numerical values fall somewhat below the experimental @xmath126 values on the heavier side of the isotope chains .",
    "this failure is quite possibly due to our choice of single - particle energy for the @xmath127 which is known to contribute to deformations in this region @xcite ; it may also be due to correlations absent due to our choice of model space .",
    "we will investigate this further in future work .",
    "pairing correlations among like nucleons is known to be important for the ground state properties of the even - even nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these correlations should become quenched along the zr and mo isotope chains as the transition from spherical to well - deformed shapes becomes more pronounced .",
    "similar effects were recently investigated in @xmath128 isotones @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the pairing content of the ground states of the nuclei of interest using a bcs - like pair operator which is defined for neutrons as    @xmath129    where the sum is over all orbitals with @xmath130 , and @xmath131 is the time - reversed operator .",
    "hence the expectation value of the pairing fields is @xmath132 .",
    "this quantity for an uncorrelated fermi gas is given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 are the neutron occupation numbers .",
    "any excess over the fermi - gas value therefore indicates pairing correlations in the ground state .",
    "our results , which are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairsn ] , confirm a suppression of these correlations , as the contribution of the added neutrons to the pairing gradually decreases and the correlations become noticeably quenched beyond @xmath135 and @xmath136 .    in addition , the occupation numbers of various orbitals are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] , demonstrating that additional neutrons are distributed into the available orbitals rather uniformly , while protons tend to migrate from the @xmath137 to the @xmath138 orbital . in the case of mo isotopes ,",
    "the spurious effect of exceeding the maximum - allowed occupancy for the @xmath138 orbital is a result of the extrapolation scheme that was used , and is indicative that the relative error bars on the occupation data after extrapolation are approximately 15% of the value of the occupation number .",
    "note that the deformation driving @xmath127 remains only slightly occuppied .",
    "we have introduced a new approach for the implementation of the shell model monte carlo method to perform shell - model calculations using non - identical proton and neutron valence spaces .",
    "general features of the smmc method were reviewed .",
    "differences between the isospin and the @xmath6-formalisms have been pointed out ; in particular , the @xmath76 projection has been described in detail .",
    "the results of the smmcpn approach have been validated in the @xmath99-shell using a  good \"- signed schematic interaction and in the @xmath17-shell using the realistic kb3 interaction . in the latter case , we dealt with the sign problem using an extrapolation method .",
    "as the first novel application of the smmcpn approach , we performed a set of calculations for the even - even @xmath4 and @xmath5 isotopes , using a realistic effective interaction in the valence space described by ( @xmath139 @xmath140 ) and ( @xmath141 @xmath142 ) orbitals .",
    "a comparison of the ground - state energies of the first few nuclei in both isotope chains showed excellent agreement with the exact diagonalization results and provides a definitive test of our algorithm and the smmcpn method .",
    "we then studied the transitional nature of the isotopes by using the @xmath3 strength as a gross measure of the @xmath143 separation . along both isotope chains",
    ", we have obtained an enhancement in the @xmath3 strengths as a function of the added neutrons , accompanied by a quenching in the neutron - pairing correlations . in spite of this qualitative reproduction of the onset of deformations ,",
    "further research clearly is needed for a qualitative result in the heavier zr and mo nuclei .",
    "a comparison with the experimental data suggests that this situation may be a shortcoming due to the degrees of freedom that are absent in the chosen valence space and possibly due to the value of the @xmath127 orbital .",
