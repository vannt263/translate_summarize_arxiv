    "organic liquid scintillators are typically employed to detect fast neutrons in mixed neutron and gamma - ray fields . when exposed to these two different types of radiation ,",
    "such scintillators emit light with dramatically different decay - time constants .",
    "gamma - rays interact dominantly with the atomic electrons of the scintillator atoms .",
    "the freed electrons are almost minimum ionizing and produce very fast flashes of light ( 10s of ns decay times ) .",
    "in contrast , neutrons interact dominantly with the hydrogen nuclei ( and to a lesser extent , carbon nuclei ) of the scintillator molecules via scattering . only the hydrogen nuclei",
    "are given sufficient energy to produce a significant signal , and in the neutron energy range from 26  mev , the recoiling protons are far from minimum ionizing and produce much slower flashes of light ( 100s of ns decay times ) . by examining the time dependence of the scintillation - light intensity",
    ", differences in pulse shapes may be identified .",
    "such pulse - shape discrimination ( psd ) may be used to determine whether or not the incident radiation was a neutron or gamma - ray .",
    "the organic liquid scintillator ne-213  @xcite has been a popular detector medium since its introduction in the early 1960s  @xcite .",
    "it is a solution of aromatic molecules suspended in a xylene solvent .",
    "the result is a flammable , corrosive , sharp - smelling liquid with a flash point of @xmath026  @xmath1c that poses a considerable health risk .",
    "nevertheless , due to its strong gamma - ray rejection properties , which are facilitated by excellent psd characteristics and high detection efficiency for fast neutrons , ne-213 ( first three scintillation - light decay constants : 3.16 , 32.3 , and 270  ns ) has long set the standard for organic liquid scintillators ( and beyond ) . as a result , newly developed",
    "fast - neutron detectors are often compared to it  @xcite .",
    "we have recently reported on a technique for tagging neutrons emitted by actinide / be - based radioactive sources  @xcite . in that paper",
    ", we also discuss in detail the experimental apparatus and technique employed here . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of our inaugural investigation performed using this neutron - tagging technique  a precision mapping of the response of a ne-213 liquid - scintillator detector using neutrons tagged from 26 mev .",
    "an 18.5 gbq @xmath2am/@xmath3be ( am / be ) source was employed for the irradiations performed in this work .",
    "we note that the neutron - tagging technique described below will work equally well for any actinide / be - based neutron source .",
    "unwanted 60  kev gamma - rays associated with the @xmath4-decay of @xmath2am were attenuated using a 3  mm thick pb sheet .",
    "the source radiated ( 1.106@xmath50.015 )  @xmath6  10@xmath7 neutrons per second nearly isotropically  .",
    "fast neutrons were produced when the @xmath4-particles from the decay of @xmath2am interacted with the @xmath3be .",
    "these neutrons had a maximum energy of about about 11  mev  @xcite .",
    "roughly 25% of the neutrons had an energy less than 1  mev  @xcite .",
    "if the recoiling @xmath8c was left in its first excited state ( about 55% of the time  @xcite ) , the freed neutron was accompanied by an isotropically radiated prompt 4.44  mev de - excitation gamma - ray .",
    "the half - value layer ( hvl ) for 3.5  mev gamma - rays in lead is 1.51  cm , and above this energy , the hvl does not increase with increasing gamma - ray energy . as a result ,",
    "fewer than 20% of these 4.44  mev gamma - rays were attenuated in the 3  mm pb sleeve .",
    "thus , the radiation field associated with the lead - shielded am / be source was to a large extent a combination of 4.44  mev gamma - rays and their associated fast - neutrons .",
    "figure  [ figure : ne213_detector ] presents the ne-213 liquid - scintillator detector employed in this measurement .",
    "a 3  mm thick cylindrical aluminum cell 62  mm deep by 94  mm in diameter , coated internally with ej-520 tio@xmath9-based reflective paint  @xcite , contained the ne-213 .",
    "a 5  mm thick borosilicate glass plate  @xcite , attached using araldite 2000@xmath10 glue  @xcite , served as an optical window .",
    "a pressurized nitrogen gas - transfer system was used to fill the cell with nitrogen - flushed ne-213 , and viton o - rings  @xcite were used to seal the filling penetrations .",
    "the filled cell was coupled to a cylindrical pmma uvt lightguide  @xcite 57  mm long by 72.5  mm in diameter coated on the outside by ej-510  @xcite tio@xmath9-based reflector .",
    "the cell / lightguide assembly was attached to a spring - loaded , @xmath11-metal shielded 3  in .",
    "et enterprises 9821 kb photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and base  @xcite .",
    "gain for the ne-213 detector was set using standard gamma - ray sources , resulting in an operating voltage of about @xmath122000 v. typical signal risetime was 5  ns .      figure  [ figure : yap_detector ] presents a photograph of one of the yap(ce ) gamma - ray detectors provided by scionix  @xcite that was employed in this measurement .",
    "yap(ce ) is an abbreviation for yttrium aluminum perovskit : cerium , or yalo@xmath13 , ce@xmath14 doped .",

    "gains for the yap(ce ) detectors were set using standard gamma - ray sources with typical operating voltages of about @xmath12800  v. typical signal risetime was 5  ns .",
    "the energy resolution for the 662  kev peak of @xmath15cs measured using such a detector was about 10% .",
    "we stress that the yap(ce ) detectors were not used for gamma - ray spectroscopy , but rather to count the 4.44  mev gamma - rays emitted by the source and thus provide a reference in time for the corresponding emitted neutrons .",
    "figure  [ figure : configuration ] shows a simplified block diagram of the experimental setup . as previously mentioned , the am / be source",
    "was placed within a 3  mm thick pb sleeve to attenuate the source - associated 60  kev gamma - rays .",
    "two yap(ce ) detectors ( for simplicity , only one is shown ) were located about 5  cm from the am / be source at source height .",
    "the threshold for the yap(ce ) detectors was about 350  kev@xmath16 ( kev electron equivalent ) .",
    "the ne-213 detector was located 2.420  m from the am / be source and also at source height .",
    "the threshold for the ne-213 detector was about 250  kev@xmath16 .",
    "both detectors triggered overwhelmingly on the source - associated 4.44  mev gamma - rays corresponding to the decay of the first excited state of @xmath8c , but they also registered a large number of 2.23  mev gamma - rays associated with neutron capture on the hydrogen in the water and paraffin used as general radiation shielding ( not shown in this simplified illustration ) .",
    "the ne-213 detector also triggered on the fast neutrons radiated from the source . by detecting both the fast neutron and the prompt correlated 4.44  mev gamma - ray , neutron time - of - flight ( tof ) and thus energy was determined .",
    "this neutron - tagging technique enabled the mapping of the response of the ne-213 cell to fast neutrons as a function of their kinetic energy .",
    "note that due to the energy invested in the 4.44  mev gamma - ray , the tagging technique restricted the maximum available tagged - neutron energies to about 6  mev .",
    "the analog signals from the detectors were split and sent to lecroy 2249a ( dc - coupled short gate sg ) and 2249w ( ac - coupled long gate lg ) camac charge - to - digital converters ( qdcs ) and phillips scientific 715 nim constant - fraction timing discriminators ( cfds ) .",
    "the discriminator logic signals were sent to lecroy 4434 scalers and lecroy 2228a camac time - to - digital converters ( tdcs ) . a ces 8210 branch driver was employed to connect the electronics to a vmebus and a sbs 616 pci - vme bus adapter was used to connect the vmebus to a linux pc - based data - acquisition ( daq ) system .",
    "the signals were recorded and processed using root - based software  @xcite .",
    "signals from the ne-213 detector were used to trigger the daq and also provided the start for the tof tdc .",
    "as previously mentioned , the ne-213 detector qdcs included a 60  ns gated sg qdc and a 500  ns gated lg qdc , where in both cases , the gates opened 25  ns prior to the arrival of the analog pulse .",
    "the yap(ce ) detector provided the stop signal for the tof tdc .",
    "we were particularly interested in two source - related event types : 1 ) a fast neutron detected in the ne-213 detector ( which started the tof tdc ) and the corresponding 4.44  mev gamma - ray detected in the yap(ce ) detector ( which stopped the tof tdc ) ; and 2 ) a prompt , time - correlated gamma - ray pair detected one in the ne-213 detector and one in a yap(ce ) detector ( a gamma - flash event , see below ) .",
    "such a pair of gamma - rays can result from , for example , the @xmath4 decay of @xmath2am to the higher excited states of @xmath17np .",
    "gamma - ray sources are typically used to calibrate organic scintillators as the light yield of the recoiling atomic electrons is linear above about 100  kev  @xcite .",
    "however , the low z value typical of liquid scintillators means that gamma - ray interactions are dominated by compton scattering at energies of a few mev .",
    "thus , resolution - broadened compton edges must be carefully interpreted in order to calibrate the detector .",
    "two different prescriptions to extract the compton edge from a resolution - smeared distribution have been reported by flynn  et  al .",
    "@xcite and knox and miller  @xcite .",
    "more recently , with the aid of monte carlo simulations , it has become generally accepted that the compton edge lies somewhere between these prescriptions  @xcite .",
    "apparently , no clear concensus exists .",
    "we simulated the response of our detector to gamma - rays ( and then neutrons , see below ) using geant4 ( version 10.00 patch2 ) with the standard electromagnetic - interaction package and hadronic physics list qgsp_bert_hp which provided high - precision data - driven models for neutron interactions below 20  mev  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the detector signal was provided by a sensitive - detector class which recorded the total energy deposited in the liquid - scintillator volume .",
    "the detector was defined to be the ne-213 filled cell together with the non - sensitive pmma lightguide . for the purpose of the energy - calibration simulation , a point source of gamma - rays was positioned along the cylindrical symmetry axis of the cell at a distance of 1.5  cm from the face .",
    "the gamma - rays were directed onto the cell along its symmetry axis .",
    "simulations of the deposited energy / scintillation - light yield for the detector were performed for the gamma - rays coming from @xmath18na ( 511  kev and 1274  kev ) and @xmath15cs ( 662  kev ) , with corresponding compton - edge - equivalent energies of 341  kev@xmath16 , 1062  kev@xmath16 , and 477  kev@xmath16 , respectively . a non - linear , energy - dependent parametrization of the detector resolution measured for gamma - ray energies between 0.5  mev@xmath16 ( 18% ) and 4.0  mev@xmath16 ( 10% )",
    "was included in the simulation .",
    "note that this exact same parametrization was used to smear the geant4-simulated detector response to produce resolution - corrected neutron scintillation - light yield spectra ( see below ) .",
    "figure  [ figure : g4_calibration ] shows a representative comparison between the geant4 simulation of the response of the detector to the gamma - rays coming from a @xmath18na source and background - subtracted data obtained with a @xmath18na source .",
    "the blue histogram corresponds to the basic simulation of the deposited energy and does not include resolution effects but clearly illustrates the compton edges at 341  kev@xmath16 and 1062  kev@xmath16 .",
    "the red histogram corresponds to the simulation including the non - linear parametrization of the energy - resolution effects detailed above .",
    "the black dots result from the subtraction of non - source - related background from the measured data .",
    "this included cosmic - ray background and experiment - hall background .",
    "the intensity of the cosmic - ray background was addressed with an energy - dependent exponential function , while the room background was addressed by identifying dominant gamma - rays present in data taken simultaneously with a hpge detector .",
    "this background was then simulated as a combination of the dominant gamma - rays  specifically , from @xmath19k ( 1460  kev ) , @xmath20tl ( 2614  kev , 583  kev , and 510  kev using the branching ratio 100:85:23 ) and 511  kev positron annihilation .",
    "the overall agreement between the measured data and simulation is very good .",
    "we attribute the very small variations between 0.5  mev@xmath16 and 1.0  mev@xmath16 to room background which we did not address .",
    "the enhanced strength at 1.4  mev may be due to the simultaneous detection of both the gamma - rays emitted by @xmath18na .    we compared the results of our simulations to the compton - edge prescriptions suggested by flynn  et  al .",
    "@xcite ( dashed black arrows in fig .",
    "[ figure : g4_calibration ] ) and knox and miller  @xcite ( solid black arrows in fig .",
    "[ figure : g4_calibration ] ) . when the flynn  et  al .",
    "approach was taken , we found it to overpredict systematically the locations of the compton edges by more than 10% .",
    "when the knox and miller approach was taken , we found it to underpredict systematically the locations of the compton edges by less than 3% .",
    "as previously mentioned , gamma - ray scintillations in ne-213 are generally fast ( 10s of ns decay times ) while neutron scintillations are much slower ( 100s of ns decay times ) .",
    "the type of radiation incident upon the ne-213 scintillator may thus be identified by examining the time structure of the scintillation pulses .",
    "we used the standard  tail - to - total \" method  @xcite . with this method ,",
    "the difference in the integrated charge produced by the scintillation - light pulses in the lg and sg qdcs was normalized to the integrated charge produced by the scintillation - light pulse in the lg qdc according to @xmath21 figure  [ figure : tof_light_yield ] presents tof distributions acquired when the ne-213 reference detector started the tof tdc and the yap(ce ) detector stopped the tof tdc .",
    "the top two panels have been presented and discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and are included here for completeness .",
    "the top panel illustrates that the separation between gamma - rays ( recoiling electrons ) and neutrons ( recoiling protons ) was excellent . in the middle panel ,",
    "the data from the top panel have been projected onto the tof axis .",
    "the @xmath22-flash and fast - neutron distributions are clearly identified .",
    "the very low level of background consists of random events which included cosmic rays , room background , am / be neutrons not correlated with a 4.44  mev gamma - ray , and am / be neutrons where the 4.44  mev gamma - ray was missed due to yap inefficiency or geometry . in the bottom panel ,",
    "our previously detailed calibration was applied to the data and the resulting scintillation - light yield is displayed for the sg qdc .",
    "it is this scintillation - light yield which we now proceed to analyze in detail .",
    "the neutron scintillation - light yield ( due to recoiling protons ) was determined by converting from tof to neutron kinetic energy , binning in widths of 0.2  mev , and filling the corresponding energy - calibrated sg and lg qdc spectra .",
    "@xmath23 was determined from the location of the gamma - flash in the tof spectra using the speed of light and measurements of the distances between the yap(ce ) detector , the ne-213 detector , and the am / be source . the neutron path length employed in this measurement was 2.420  m. based upon our 1.8  ns gamma - flash and the detector thickness of 6.2  cm , we determined our energy resolution to be 4% at 2  mev and 5% at 4  mev .",
    "if the tof bin width is sufficiently small and there was no smearing due to energy - resolution effects , each of these spectra would demonstrate a sharp cutoff corresponding to the neutron transferring all of its energy to the recoiling proton . in our detector ,",
    "resolution effects smeared this maximum - transfer edge .",
    "further , as in the case for locating the compton edge for the energy calibration of organic scintillators with gamma - ray sources , there is no single prescription for relating the maximum proton energy to the resolution - smeared maximum - transfer edge .",
    "thus , for each energy bin , we have investigated three edge - determination prescriptions :    1 .   as suggested by naqvi  et  al .",
    "@xcite , a gaussian function was fitted to the high - energy edge of the recoil - proton energy distribution and the maximum - transfer edge was taken to be the half - height ( hh ) position .",
    "2 .   as suggested by kornilov  et  al .",
    "@xcite , the location of the most energetic minimum in the first derivative ( fd ) of the recoil - proton energy distribution was associated with the maximum - transfer edge .",
    "the maximum - transfer edge was taken as the turning point ( tp ) of the gaussian function fitted to the resolution - smeared edge .",
    "note that if the fitted gaussian function described the resolution - smeared maximum - transfer edge perfectly , then the location of its tp is by definition identical to the minimum in the first derivative of the recoil - proton energy distribution .    in each investigation , the non - linear correspondence between recoiling electron ( @xmath24 ) and recoiling proton ( @xmath25 ) scintillation light - yield has been represented in two ways : @xmath26 @xmath27\\}\\label{eq:2_from_cecil79}\\ ] ] eq .",

    "the simulated detector response is shown without resolution effects , and the location of the maximum - transfer edge may be observed at about 2.36  mev@xmath16 . as the degree of smearing of the simulated detector response due to energy - resolution effects affects the location of the maximum - transfer edge in the simulated detector response predicted by the various prescriptions , the non - linear energy - dependent parametrization of the detector resolution measured for gamma - ray energies between 0.5  mev@xmath16 and 4.0  mev@xmath16 that we employed in our calibration efforts was again employed to accurately smear the simulated detector response .",

    "the average location of the 5  mev maximum - transfer edge is 2.33  mev@xmath16 , and all three predictions based upon the data agree to about 1% .",
    "for these same 5  mev neutrons , with the hh method for positioning the maximum - transfer edge fixed , we then varied the light - yield scaling in the geant4 simulation to the values obtained using the tp and fd prescriptions ( see the red curves at 5  mev in the middle and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ figure : results ] ) .",
    "in all three cases , the geant4 simulations were very close to the data up to 2  mev@xmath16 , with the fd and tp results lying at most 5% and 3% respectively above the hh results .",
    "above 2  mev@xmath16 , comparison was difficult due to a combination of lack of statistics and resolution effects . for simulated ( 4.0  @xmath5  0.1 )  mev neutrons , light - yield scaling factors derived from all three methods resulted in a constant 8% overestimation of the location of the maximum - transfer edges extracted from the data according to the procedure described above .",

    "simulation and analysis agreed for all prescriptions at the 1% level . at 4  mev , all three geant4 predictions for the maximum - transfer edge overestimated the location of the maximum - transfer edge extracted from the data by 8% . at 3  mev , the difference between the edge locations extracted from the simulation and data for the hh prescription remained at 8% , while for the tp and fd prescriptions , the difference increased to 12% and 18% , respectively .",
    "a possible cause of the disprecancy is an incomplete consideration of increasing quenching of the scintillation as @xmath38 increases along the track of the recoiling proton .",
    "this will be investigated in future work .",
    "nevertheless , the hh method produced the best results for our detector over our energy range .",
    "the present results indicate that for recoiling protons in the present energy range , @xmath39% ( see table  [ table : scale_factors ] ) of the total integrated scintillation intensity ( integration period 475  ns ) is contained with the first 35  ns of the signal . comparing the total light yield ( lg ) to previous measurements ,",
    "the present results are in good agreement with those of gagnon - moisan  et  al .",
    "@xcite and within a few percent of those of cecil  et  al .",
    "@xcite , the latter of which being used to estimate recoil - proton scintillation - light output in the absence of a calibration .",
    "the present lg results are higher by a factor @xmath40 compared to those of kornilov et  al .",
    "@xcite and naqvi et  al .",
    "these previous measurements yield results which are actually close to our sg results ( integration period 35  ns ) , but it is impossible to say if this discrepancy is due to a difference in effective integration times , as the pulse - processing method was different .",
    "at least part of the disprecancy could be due to real differences in the response of the liquid scintillator .",
    "factors such as concentration of the active scintillant / fluorescent materials in the base solvent and the presence of dissolved oxygen will affect the relative recoiling proton - to - electron scintillation - light yields . indeed , it would seem that a dedicated measurement of the recoil - proton scintillation - light yield must be made on a case - by - case basis to obtain the best accuracy in precision neutron measurements .",
    "the present measurements have been made at a new neutron test facility recently installed at lund university  @xcite .",
    "this facility is being used to measure the characteristics of neutron detectors as part of the program to build the european spallation source .",
    "development and extension of this facility is ongoing with a view to precisely determining the response of many materials to neutrons ranging in energies from fast to thermal .",
