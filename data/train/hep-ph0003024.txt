    "in the search for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking , strong coupling models are an alternative to the standard model higgs mechanism , or for weakly coupled theories based on supersymmetry .",
    "although classical technicolor@xcite suffers from major shortcomings , viable multiscale models have been developed  @xcite which allow for fermion mass generation and for the absence of weak neutral currents .",
    "these models , which are not necessarily excluded by precision measurements of electroweak parameters at lep and slc  @xcite , not only provide the technipions which serve as the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons , but also predict the existence of technipions ( @xmath3 ) as mass eigenstates , as well as technirhos ( @xmath0 ) , and other techniparticles .    the feasibility of observing such resonances produced in @xmath4 fusion , in atlas has been reported in  @xcite .",
    "the analysis was based on a pythia  @xcite implementation of the multiscale model of eichten , lane and womersley  @xcite , and took into account detector effects by using a fast simulation of the atlas detector .",
    "in particular , one of the channels analyzed was @xmath5 production with subsequent decay into @xmath6 . assuming a quark fusion process , the authors  @xcite of the model have calculated the relevant matrix elements .",
    "it has then been shown in  @xcite that , given some reasonable values for the parameters of the model , the observation of such a process should be feasible with atlas , but is limited by background for possible large masses of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .    the technique of forward jet tagging has been shown  @xcite to be very powerful in eliminating backgrounds from such processes as @xmath7 + jets production .",
    "for that reason , it is important to estimate if @xmath0 production via a vector boson fusion process can be a useful complementary channel for discovery of such a resonance .",
    "we evaluate here the cross section for this process .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "first , the model for the form factor and decay width of @xmath0 are presented in section 2 .",
    "results on the cross section calculation are given in section 3 .",
    "the main results are summarized in the conclusion .",
    "in this section we describe in detail the essential features of the model used in our calculations .    the lighter isotriplet @xmath0 is assumed to decay dominantly into pairs of the mixed state of isotriplet @xmath8 , where the value of the mixing angle @xmath9 is assumed  @xcite to be : @xmath10 .",
    "the vertex @xmath11 , where @xmath12 may be longitudinal @xmath13 bosons or technipion @xmath3 , has the following form  @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the momenta of @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the polarization vector of @xmath0 ; the parameters @xmath21 are equal to @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a coupling constant , normalized as follows  @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( see  @xcite ) .    being a compound object , consisting of two heavy techniquarks , the technirho couples to two technipions ( or longitudinal @xmath26 bosons ) by means of the diagram in fig.1 .",
    "in the loop the techniquarks 1 and 2 are on - shell ( it is a typical approximation for a such consideration ) , while quark  3 is virtual .",
    "the latter has a momentum @xmath27 given by : @xmath28    the production vertex is naturally suppressed by large virtualities of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but is enhanced , in that case , by large values of @xmath27 in the numerator . to be consistent with the effective w approximation ( ewa ) , the additional form factor @xmath29 in ( [ vrt1 ] ) is introduced .    @xmath30    where @xmath31 are the masses of @xmath32 .",
    "in analogy with the case of a heavy @xmath33-meson , this form - factor takes into account the possible off - shellness of technipions @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the denominator in the effective @xmath34 vertex ( [ ff1 ] ) results from the propagator of this virtual quark in the loop : @xmath35 where @xmath36 .    in the decay vertex of @xmath0 , for on - shell technipions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we have @xmath37 .    using the vertex ( [ vrt1 ] )",
    "we get the well - known equation for the @xmath11 decay width  @xcite : @xmath38    we investigate the case of @xmath39 production with its subsequent decay into @xmath40 pair .",
    "the corresponding branching ratio has a non - trivial behavior , as can be seen in fig.2 for three decay channels of the charged technirho : @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "we can distinguish two regions in the technipion to technirho mass ratio .",
    "in the first region , namely @xmath44 , the @xmath45 decay is kinematically allowed . as @xmath46 increases ( keeping @xmath47 fixed ) the relative momentum @xmath48 in equation  ( [ gamro ] ) decreases . as a result",
    "we have a decreasing branching fraction for the @xmath49 channel , while the other two channels increase in their relative value ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "just above the value @xmath50 the branching ratio for the @xmath51 channel reaches its maximum value . as the mass of @xmath3 rises further , in the second region up to the kinematic bound @xmath52 , the relative boson momentum @xmath53 decreases , yielding a decreasing branching ratio for technipion  @xmath54  longitudinal @xmath7 boson",
    "we examine the reaction of technirho production at @xmath55  tev ( lhc collider ) with subsequent decay of the technirho into a neutral technipion @xmath56 and a longitudinal @xmath57-boson @xmath58 since each of the final particles from the @xmath0 decay has a very narrow width in comparison with its mass , we take both the final @xmath1-boson and technipion to be on - shell",
    ".    one of the diagrams describing the subprocess @xmath59 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . only fusion of longitudinal @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons , radiated from the initial quarks @xmath60 and @xmath61 , needs to be taken into account .",
    "the polarization vector of a longitudinal boson with mass  @xmath62 and 4-momentum @xmath60 is equal to  @xcite ; @xmath63    in our calculations we set that @xmath64 we use the cteq2l parameterization of the proton structure functions  @xcite . for evolution scale",
    "we set @xmath65 .",
    "the resulting cross sections for different values of the masses of @xmath39 and @xmath56 are presented in the table  [ tab : sig ] .",
    "note that the cross section of the reaction  ( [ reac1 ] ) may be presented in the factorized form as follows : @xmath66 therefore , the @xmath46-dependence of the cross section for reaction  ( [ reac1 ] ) with a given value of @xmath47 is completely determined by the branching ratio of technirho decay into @xmath51 ( see  fig.2 ) .",
    "in particular , we expect that the cross section of reaction  ( [ reac1 ] ) should reach a maximum for @xmath67 .    a brief remark about the role of the form - factor @xmath68 in the @xmath34 vertex  ( [ vrt1 ] ) is in order .",
    "in fig.4 comparison is made of the pseudorapidity distribution of the final primary light quarks @xmath69 ( not from @xmath56 decay ) .",
    "the dashed histogram corresponds to the @xmath70 and @xmath71 dependent form - factor @xmath68 using expression  ( [ ff1 ] ) , while the solid histogram is produced with @xmath72 . from this figure",
    "one clearly sees that the latter choice ( @xmath73 ) disagrees with expectations from the effective @xmath7-approximation , since the pseudorapidity distribution of the final @xmath74 do not peak in the forward and backward direction ) .",
    "other differential distributions are shown in the figs .",
    "5 - 6 ( solid histograms ) .",
    "we also compare our exact results with the calculations within effective @xmath7-approximation approach  @xcite . in this case the matrix element for the process @xmath75 looks very simple .",
    "the exact form of the @xmath76 is presented below @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the momenta of the initial @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the momenta of the final longitudinal @xmath1 boson and techipion @xmath3 , respectively ( see  @xcite , for detail ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 are given by the equation  ( [ cab ] ) .",
    "the corresponding differential distributions are shown in the figs .",
    "5 - 6 ( dashed histograms ) .",
    "one can see from these figures that the shapes from the exact and ewa calculations are in good agreement .    as an example for the above calculation ,",
    "the same case as in  @xcite but by the process of gauge boson fusion , has been reported in  @xcite : @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 is an electron or muon ) , with @xmath86 = 800 gev and @xmath87 = 500 gev . for this process",
    ", @xmath88 is about 2.2 fb , as can be seen from table 1 ( accounting for both @xmath89 and @xmath90 decays of the charged @xmath7 .",
    "this cross section depends sensitively on the assumed value of the mixing @xmath91 between the longitudinal gauge bosons and the technipions since it involves the @xmath92 vertex as well as the @xmath93 vertex .",
    "it was shown that , with the same model parameters , the resulting signal would leave about 2.6 events on a background of about 5.6 for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb@xmath94 , or a value of @xmath95 .",
    "this is to be compared with a significance of 2.1 obtained in ref  @xcite for the @xmath4 fusion contribution .",
    "this process of vector boson fusion with forward tagging of jets could therefore complement the @xmath4 fusion process , but would not be a discovery channel unless the @xmath88 is at least 12 fb .",
    "we have calculated the cross section and differential distributions for @xmath0 production , in the vector boson fusion channel .",
    "we have compared our exact calculations with those within the effective w - boson approximation .",
    "the shapes of the differential distributions for the final particles ( charged leptons and @xmath96-quarks ) obtained by the two methods ( the exact and ewa ) are in reasonable agreement .    for a particular choice of masses for the technirho and technipion ( @xmath97  gev and @xmath98  gev ) the possibility of extracting the signal from the background was evaluated .",
    "after applications of kinematical cuts , assuming low luminosity , one would expect about 2.6 events from the signal and about 5.6 ones from the background .",
    "therefore , the process of vector boson fusion with forward tagging of jets could complement the @xmath4 fusion process .",
