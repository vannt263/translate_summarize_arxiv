    "hereinafter we will consider the minimal sets of generators only , i.e. such that none of the @xmath6 is expressed from the others with positive coefficients .",

    ".    a solution locus of each inequality is a half - space of @xmath8 . for any subsystem @xmath9 of its solution set",
    "is a convex polyhedral cone .",
    "the faces of the latter are the intersections of @xmath3 with solution loci of some equation subsystems @xmath10 with linearly independent left - hand sides .",

    "this problem is closely related to the following one .",
    "extend the system by a new inequality @xmath11 not all the points of the cone @xmath3 satisfy , thus the system together with define a new cone @xmath12 .",

    "the motzkin - burger algorithm solves this problem .",
    "the iteration of the motzkin - burger algorithm solves the first problem by means of extending the trivial system @xmath13 by the inequalities of one by one .",
    "the set of generators for a cone @xmath12 consists of generators for cone @xmath3 ( which satisfy the inequality @xmath14 ) and the whole set of generators for cone @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "thus , in order to compute the cone @xmath12 we need to study both the structure of the cone @xmath3 and structure of the intersection .",

    "it behave more complicated : for every fixed @xmath128 and @xmath117 the case of the systems of full rank or `` almost '' full rank may be computed more faster than in the case of small rank .",
    "of course , the option slows down the performance ( this is the consequence of inefficient maple ` subs ` implementation we are using ) starting from some dimension , but we hope that the systems of larger dimension will be computed more faster with this option .",
    "nevertheless , to improve this performance bottleneck is the main aim of further work.=-1"
