    "although phrased in terms of asymptotically conic manifolds we emphasize that our results apply in particular to    @xmath25 schrdinger operators @xmath26 on @xmath27 , with @xmath28 suitably regular and decaying at infinity ;    @xmath25 nontrapping metric perturbations of flat euclidean space , with the perturbation suitably regular and decaying at infinity .",

    "this approach works well on a finite time interval , but can not be expected to work on an infinite time interval as the errors accumulate over time : certainly they can not be expected to decay to zero as @xmath84 , as would be required to prove @xmath85 estimates in time on an infinite interval .",
    "the main new idea in the current paper is to express the propagator @xmath82 _ exactly _ using the spectral measure @xmath86 , exploiting the very precise information on the spectral measure for the laplacian on asymptotically conic nontrapping manifolds has recently become available from the works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "after expressing the propagator in terms of an integral of the multiplier @xmath87 against the spectral measure , our strategy is to use the abstract strichartz estimate proved in keel - tao @xcite .",
    "thus , with @xmath88 denoting the ( abstract ) propagator , we need to show uniform @xmath89 estimates for @xmath88 , and @xmath90 type dispersive estimate on the @xmath91 with an bound of the form @xmath92 . in the flat euclidean",
    "setting , the estimates are obvious because of the explicit formula for the propagator .",
    "but in our general setting it turns out to be more complicated .",
    "it follows from @xcite that _ the propagator @xmath93 fails to satisfy such a dispersive estimate at any pair of conjugate points _",
    "@xmath94 ( i.e. pairs @xmath95 where geodesics emanating from @xmath96 focus at @xmath97 ) .",
    "our geometric assumptions allow conjugate points , so we need to modify the propagator such that the failure of the dispersive estimate at conjugate points is avoided .",
    "this is possible due to the @xmath98 nature of the estimates required by the keel - tao formalism .",
    "recall that the dispersive estimate required by keel - tao is of the form @xmath99 if @xmath88 is the propagator @xmath82 then the operator on the left hand side is @xmath100 .",
    "however , nothing in the keel - tao formalism requires the @xmath88 to form a group of operators .",
    "hence we are free to break up @xmath101 and prove the estimate for each @xmath102 .",
    "our choice of @xmath103 ( sketched directly below ) means that @xmath104 is essentially the kernel @xmath105 _ localized sufficiently close to the diagonal that we avoid pairs of conjugate points _ , and hence can prove the dispersive estimate .",
    "our method of decomposing @xmath101 is motivated by a decomposition used in the proof in @xcite of a _ restriction estimate _ for the spectral measure , that is , an estimate of the form @xmath106    in @xcite , it was observed that to prove a restriction estimate for @xmath86 , it suffices ( via a @xmath107 argument ) to prove the same estimate for the operators @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is a partition of the identity operator in @xmath54 .",
    "the operators @xmath109 used in @xcite are pseudodifferential operators ( of a certain specific type ) serving to localize @xmath86 in phase space close to the diagonal .",
    "the authors of @xcite showed that the localized operators @xmath110 satisfy kernel estimates analogous to those satisfied by the spectral measure for @xmath111 on flat euclidean space : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the @xmath114th derivative in @xmath115 of the spectral measure , and @xmath116 is the riemannian distance on @xmath11 .",
    "the authors of @xcite hoped that could be used as a ` black box ' in applications of their work .",
    "unfortunately , seems inadequate for our present purposes .",
    "this is because , in order to obtain the dispersive estimate , we need to efficiently exploit the oscillation of the ` spectral multiplier ' @xmath87 , and particularly the discrepancy between the way this function oscillates relative to the oscillations ( in @xmath115 ) of the schwartz kernel of the spectral measure . _",
    "the second main innovation of this paper is to improve estimate on the localized spectral measure .",
    "_ we show    [ prop : localized spectral measure ] let @xmath17 and @xmath65 be in theorem [ strichartz ]",
    ". then there exists a @xmath115-dependent operator partition of unity on @xmath117 @xmath118 with @xmath119 independent of @xmath115 , such that for each @xmath120 we can write @xmath121 with estimates @xmath122 @xmath123 here @xmath124 is the riemannian distance on @xmath11 .",
    "the estimates , are easily seen to imply ( using lemma [ ledb ] to estimate the @xmath115-derivatives of the operators @xmath125 ) .",
    "however , , also capture the oscillatory behaviour of the spectral measure , which is crucial in obtaining sharp dispersive estimates in section  [ sec : dispersive ] .",
    "we now define localized ( in phase space ) propagators @xmath103 by @xmath126 then the operator @xmath127 is given , at least formally , by ( see lemma [ bb * ] ) @xmath128 however , there are subtleties involved in spectral integrals such as , containing operator - valued functions . even to show that is well - defined as a bounded operator on @xmath54 is nontrivial .",
    "_ the third main innovation of this paper is to give an effective method for analyzing spectral integrals such as , with operator - valued multipliers .",
    "_ we use a dyadic decomposition in @xmath115 and a cotlar - stein almost orthogonality argument to show the well - definedness of and prove a uniform estimate on @xmath129 , as required by the keel - tao formalism .",
    "having made sense of , we exploit the oscillations both in the multiplier @xmath130 and in the localized spectral measure ( as expressed by and ) to obtain the required dispersive estimate for @xmath127 .",
    "the homogeneous strichartz estimate for @xmath82 then follows by applying keel - tao to each @xmath102 and summing over @xmath131 .",
    "next we consider the inhomogeneous strichartz estimates . as is well - known , the non - endpoint cases of the inhomogeneous estimate follow from the homogeneous estimate and the christ - kiselev lemma .",
    "the endpoint inhomogeneous estimate requires an additional argument , and in particular , in this case we require estimates on @xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "this estimate turns out to be very similar to the uniform sobolev estimate ( on asymptotically conic nontrapping manifolds ) of guillarmou and the first author @xcite .",
    "we use the techniques of that paper , in particular a refined partition of the identity operator .",
    "this resemblance to the proof in @xcite is more than formal : as pointed out to us by thomas duyckaerts and colin guillarmou , the inhomogeneous endpoint strichartz estimate implies the uniform sobolev estimate ; we sketch this argument in section  [ sec : inhom ] .",
    "thus , this part of the paper can be regarded as a time - dependent reformulation of the proof in @xcite , leading to a more general result .",
    "now we review some classical results about the strichartz estimates . in the flat euclidean space , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 , one can take @xmath136 ; see strichartz @xcite , ginibre and velo @xcite , keel and tao @xcite , and references therein . the now - classic paper @xcite by keel - tao developed an abstract approach to strichartz estimates which has become the standard approach in most subsequent literature , including this paper .",
    "strichartz estimates for compact metric perturbations of euclidean space were proved locally in time by staffilani and tataru @xcite , and subsequently for asymptotically euclidean manifolds by robbiano - zuily @xcite and bouclet - tzvetkov @xcite , and in the asymptotically conic setting by hassell - tao - wunsch @xcite and mizutani @xcite . in these works , either the metric is assumed nontrapping , or the theorem holds outside a compact set . in @xcite",

    "the proof is essentially identical to that of lemma  [ lem : sign - low ] .",
    "the form of the oscillatory integrals comes from the fact that the spectral measure , for high energies , is a legendre distribution in the class @xmath905 , where the lagrangian @xmath324 is given by .",
