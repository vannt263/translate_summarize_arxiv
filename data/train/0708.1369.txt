    "the sintering of tungsten can be enhanced by the addition of small amounts of alloying elements ( 0.5 - 1.0% ) from the iron group metals such as fe , co , and ni .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` activated sintering.''@xcite these additive species lower the activation energy for sintering , resulting in a much lower sintering temperature , shorter sintering time , or better properties.@xcite the classical theory explains this by the enhancement of grain - boundary diffusion in tungsten due to the presence of the respective element in the grain boundary .",
    "high densities ( up to 99% of bulk ) can be obtained even at 1100  @xmath0c ( at this temperature , tungsten compacts are commonly presintered ) .",
    "@xcite because of high melting point and large surface energy , tungsten has been considered to be one of the best substrates to grow thin magnetic films on and consequently its interaction with magnetic materials including fe has been studied extensively.@xcite    in this study , we investigated the activated sintering of tungsten by iron from a quantum mechanics point of view .",
    "adsortion and desorption are two of the main mechanisms of sintering .",
    "the aim of the present work is to explore the morphology and energetics of thin fe layers on w surfaces and their effect on the adsorption / desorption of w atoms and eventually on the sintering of tungsten .",
    "our approach is based on density functional theory and we show that our atomistic first - principles modeling and simulation can supplement the experiments and provide a fundamental mechanism of the activated sintering of tungsten by iron . our present study is focused on the adsorption of tungsten on w(100 ) surfaces .",
    "the adsorption of w atoms on a clean w(100 ) surface is compared with the one on the same surface covered with a monolayer of fe atoms .",
    "the surface morphology and energy barriers were calculated and analyzed to elucidate the role of fe atoms in the adsorption of w atoms .",
    "the adsorption energy of a single adatom @xmath1 at height @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the total energy of the structure with the adatom adsorbed at height @xmath2 on the surface and @xmath5 is the total energy of the same surface with the adatom at an infinite distance .",
    "all _ ab initio _ total - energy calculations and geometry optimizations are performed within density functional theory ( dft ) using blchl s all - electron projector augmented wave ( paw ) method@xcite as implemented by kresse et al.@xcite for the treatment of electron exchange and correlation , we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew et al.@xcite the kohn - sham equations are solved using a preconditioned band - by - band conjugate - gradient ( cg ) minimization.@xcite the plane - wave cutoff energy is set to at least 350  ev in all calculations .",
    "the tungsten lattice constant of 3.175   we obtained is slightly larger than the experimental value of 3.165 .@xcite we use a standard supercell technique , modeling the w(100 ) surface with ( 3@xmath63 ) surface unit cell by a slab consisting of seven substrate layers , separated by 10.0   of vacuum .",
    "atoms in the bottom layer are fixed at their bulk positions , while all other atoms are allowed to relax until the root - mean - square ( rms ) force is less than 0.001  ev /  .",
    "the brillouin zone is sampled with a density equivalent to at least 81 @xmath7-points in ( 1@xmath61 ) surface brillouin zone using the monkhorst - pack scheme.@xcite a fermi - level smearing of 0.2  ev was applied using the methfessel - paxton method.@xcite",

    "[ fig : w - adsorption](b - d ) show three different configurations of a w adatom adsorbed on w(100 ) surface covered by a fe monolayer . for each configuration ,",
    "all atoms are fully relaxed except the atoms in the bottom layer .",
    "w(100 ) surface is known to exhibit a ( @xmath8@xmath6@xmath8)@xmath945@xmath10 reconstruction at low temperatures.@xcite it also has been observed that the surface reconstruction vanishes locally upon the adsorption of a mn atom on w(100 ) surface.@xcite our result is in good agreement with these observations .",
    "two deltoids in fig .",
    "[ fig : w - adsorption](a ) show the distortion of nearest neighbor bond angles due to surface reconstruction .",
    "the upper - left deltoid containing the w adatom is indistinguishable from a square reflecting the fact that the reconstruction is suppressed due to the adsorption of the w atom . on the contrary , the lower - right deltoid has two equal obtuse angles of 96.1@xmath10 indicating the distortion of bond angles due to surface reconstruction .",
    "however , because the deltoid is adjacent to the w adatom adsorption site , the angle is smaller than 106@xmath10 observed for clean w(100 ) surfaces.@xcite    the adsorption energies and the optimized height for these configurations are listed in table  [ tab : e - ads ] . fig .  [",
    "fig : w - adsorption - energy ] also shows the adsorption energy of a w adatom on two different surfaces , a clean w(100 ) surface and an fe monolayer on w(100 ) surface , as a function of the height . for the configurations ( a - d )",
    ", only the bottom layers are fixed and all other atom positions are fully relaxed .",
    "the other points in fig .",
    "[ fig : w - adsorption - energy ] are generated by additionally fixing the height of the w adatom .",
    "[ fig : w - adsorption](b ) shows the morphology of a w atom adsorbed on an fe monolayer on the w(100 ) surface .",
    "it turned out that the most energetically favorable adsorption site for a w adatom is not directly above the center of the square formed by four neighboring fe atoms , but closer to one of the surrounding fe atoms . in fig .",
    "[ fig : w - adsorption](c ) , the w adatom is pushed in toward the closest fe atom .",
    "consequently , the fe atom is displaced from its place and forms a horizontal dimer with the w adatom .",
    "although configuration @xmath11 has a higher adsorption energy than that of configuration @xmath12 by @xmath13  ev as shown in table  [ tab : e - ads ] , configuration @xmath11 is stable against small perturbation of atomic positions of the w - fe dimer .",
    "when the w adatom is pushed in further , it replaces the fe atom completely and the displaced fe atom will adsorb above the fe monolayer , as shown as configuration @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : w - adsorption](d ) .",
    "our result is consistent with the experimental observation that the addition of a small amount of fe atoms enhances the sintering of tungsten .",
    "our study shows that there are two main effects of fe atoms on tungsten sintering .",
    "first , the existence of a stable adsorption site on an fe monolayer ( configuration @xmath12 ) leads to more efficient desorption of w atoms .",
    "this means that the desorption of w atoms occurs in two stages when fe atoms are present .",
    "starting from configuration @xmath14 , w atoms first move to configuration @xmath12 by passing through the fe layers via the pathway @xmath15 .",
    "the w atoms overcome a moderate size energy barrier of @xmath16  ev utilizing the thermal excitation readily available during sintering process . at the second stage ,",
    "w atoms can be desorbed from configuration @xmath12 .",
    "compared to the direct desorption from configuration @xmath17 in the absence of fe atoms , this multi - stage desorption through configuration @xmath12 is much more efficient because the adsorption energy of w atom at @xmath12 is significantly lower than at @xmath17 : @xmath18  ev ( see table  [ tab : e - ads ] ) .",
    "second , the existence of stable adsorption sites on fe monolayer makes the diffusion of w atoms on fe atoms available for an efficient sintering process .",
    "the smaller adsorption energy of a w atom on an fe monolayer strongly suggests that the fe thin film layer will provide a much smoother platform for the adsorbed w atoms to diffuse .",
    "this enhanced diffusion will facilitate the movement of w atoms from one place to another .",
    "a further detailed investigation will be required to elucidate the effect of fe atoms on diffusion of w atoms and it will be reported elsewhere .",
    "comparison with different activation agents , such as co or ni , will also provide valuable information in validating the mechanism proposed from the present work .",
    "we have presented a first - principles dft investigation of the structure and energetics of a w adatom on w(100 ) and fe / w(100 ) surfaces .",
    "we found that w atoms adsorbs on an fe monolayer .",
    "fe atoms also reduce the adsorption energy of w adatoms on w(100 ) surface substantially .",
