    "two - dimensional turbulent flows with high reynolds numbers have the striking property of organizing spontaneously into large - scale coherent structures such as jets and vortices . jovian atmosphere shows a wide diversity of structures : jupiter s great red spot , white ovals , brown barges , ... a good hydrodynamical model to describe jovian atmosphere is provided by the shallow - water ( sw ) equations . a statistical theory of the sw system has been developed recently by @xcite .",
    "this extends the statistical mechanics of the incompressible 2d euler equation proposed by @xcite and @xcite to the case of compressible flows .",
    "it is however assumed that the flow is weakly compressible ( small mach number ) so that the effect of waves is not dominant .",
    "therefore , large - scale coherent vortices can form and persist for a long time .",
    "after a phase of chaotic mixing ( violent relaxation ) , the system is expected to reach an equilibrium state which corresponds to the most mixed state consistent with the constraints imposed by the dynamics .",
    "mathematically , it is obtained by maximizing a mixing entropy while conserving energy , mass , circulation and all the higher moments of the pv vorticity ( casimirs ) .",
    "one difficulty with this approach is that the moments of pv depend on the resolution at which the pv field is considered so that the prediction can change accordingly .",
    "furthermore , geophysical flows are usually forced and dissipated at small - scales so that the conservation of all the casimirs is abusive . in an attempt to solve these problems ,",
    "@xcite have proposed to fix a prior vorticity distribution instead of the casimirs .",
    "it is assumed that this global distribution of vorticity is generated by the small - scale forcing so it must be given as an _ input _ in the statistical theory . in this approach ,",
    "only the conservation of the robust constraints @xmath0 is taken into account and the effect of the small - scale forcing is encapsulated in a prior vorticity distribution or in a generalized entropy .",
    "this approach has been further developed in @xcite and @xcite in the context of the quasi - geostrophic ( qg ) equations . in this paper",
    ", we show how it can be extended to the case of the shallow - water ( sw ) equations .",
    "since this is only a slight , but interesting , variant with respect to the un - forced case , we shall mostly refer to the study of @xcite for technical details , without repeating all the steps of the derivation .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a thin fluid layer with thickness @xmath1 and velocity field @xmath2 submitted to a gravity acceleration @xmath3 on a rotating planet is governed by the shallow water equations @xmath4 @xmath5 the first equation can be viewed as an equation of continuity and the second equation as the euler equation ( in a rotating frame @xmath6 ) for a barotropic fluid with pressure @xmath7 .",
    "the euler equation can be rewritten @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vorticity and where we have introduced the bernouilli function @xmath10 the potential vorticity ( pv ) @xmath11 is conserved for each fluid parcel , i.e. @xmath12 each mass element @xmath13 is also conserved in the course of the evolution .",
    "this implies that the shallow - water equations conserve the pv moments @xmath14 the moments @xmath15 are , respectively , the total mass @xmath16 , the circulation @xmath17 and the pv enstrophy @xmath18 .",
    "the energy @xmath19 involving a kinetic and a potential part is also conserved .",
    "it is convenient to use a helmholtz decomposition of the momentum @xmath20 into a purely rotational and purely divergent part @xmath21    for any stationary solution , the mass conservation ( [ sa1 ] ) reduces to @xmath22 so that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the stream - function",

    "finally , eq . ( [ sa3 ] ) reduces to @xmath27 taking the scalar product with @xmath28 , we obtain @xmath29 so that @xmath30 . then , substituting eq .",
    "( [ sa10 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ sa11 ] ) we obtain @xmath31 the sw equations admit an infinite class of stationary solutions , specified by the relations @xmath30 and @xmath32 .",
    "they are determined by the two coupled partial differential differential equations for @xmath24 and @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 this formulation of the sw equations in terms of @xmath36 variables has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "the sw equations are known to develop a complicated mixing process which ultimately leads to the emergence of a large - scale coherent structure , typically a jet or a vortex .",
    "one question of fundamental interest is to understand and predict the structure and the stability of these equilibrium states .",
    "this can be achieved by using statistical mechanics arguments .",
    "the idea is to replace the deterministic description of the flow @xmath37 by a probabilistic description where @xmath38 gives the density probability of finding the pv level @xmath39 in @xmath40 at time @xmath41 ( it satisfies the local normalization condition @xmath42 ) .",
    "the observed ( coarse - grained ) pv field is then expressed as @xmath43 .",
    "to apply the statistical theory , one must first specify the constraints attached to the sw equations .",
    "the mass @xmath44 , circulation @xmath45 and energy @xmath46 will be called _ robust constraints _ because they can be expressed in terms of the coarse - grained field .",
    "these integrals can be calculated at any time from the coarse - grained field and they are conserved by the ( macroscopic ) dynamics . by contrast , the casimir invariants @xmath47 , or equivalently the fine - grained moments of the vorticity @xmath48 , will be called _ fragile constraints _ because they must be expressed in terms of the fine - grained pv .",
    "indeed , the moments of the coarse - grained pv @xmath49 are _ not _ conserved since @xmath50 ( part of the coarse - grained moments goes into fine - grained fluctuations ) .",
    "therefore , the moments @xmath51 must be calculated from the fine - grained field @xmath37 or from the initial conditions , i.e. before the pv vorticity has mixed . since we often do not know the initial conditions nor the fine - grained field",
    ", the casimir invariants often appear as `` hidden constraints '' @xcite .",
    "the statistical theory of miller and robert - sommeria - chavanis for the 2d euler equations and the sw equations is based on several assumptions : ( i ) it is assumed that the flow is freely evolving without small - scale forcing and dissipation .",
    "( ii ) it is assumed that we know the initial conditions ( or equivalently the value of all the casimirs ) in detail .",
    "( iii ) it is assumed that mixing is efficient and that the evolution is ergodic so that the system will reach at equilibrium the most probable ( most mixed ) state . within these assumptions , the statistical equilibrium state of the sw system is obtained by maximizing the mixing entropy @xmath52=-\\int \\rho\\ln\\rho h d{\\bf r}d\\sigma , \\label{free1}\\ ] ] while conserving the energy , the circulation , the mass and _ all the casimirs_. we write the variational principle in the form @xmath53 in the present point of view , all the constraints are treated on the same footing . in particular , the moments @xmath54 are treated microcanonically and we must ultimately relate the lagrange multipliers @xmath55 to the constraints @xmath54 .      in the approach of @xcite , it is assumed that the system is strictly described by the sw equations so that the conservation of all the casimirs has to be taken into account .",
    "however , in geophysical situations , the flows are forced and dissipated at small scales ( due to convection in the jovian atmosphere ) so that the conservation of the casimirs is destroyed .",
    "@xcite have proposed to treat these situations by fixing the conjugate variables @xmath56 instead of the fragile moments @xmath51 .",
    "if we view the pv levels as species of particles , this is similar to fixing the chemical potentials instead of the total number of particles in each species .",
    "therefore , the idea is to treat the fragile constraints _ canonically _ , whereas the robust constraints @xmath57 are still treated _",
    "microcanonically_. this point of view has been further developed in @xcite and @xcite in the qg model and this approach is extended here to the sw system .",
    "the relevant thermodynamical potential is obtained from the mixing entropy ( [ free1 ] ) by using a legendre transform with respect to the fragile constraints : @xmath58 explicating the fine - grained moments , we obtain @xmath59 introducing the function @xmath60 we get @xmath61=-\\int \\rho \\ln\\biggl\\lbrack { \\rho\\over\\chi(\\sigma)}\\biggr\\rbrack h d{\\bf r}d\\sigma , \\label{p4}\\ ] ] which has the form of a relative entropy . the function @xmath62 is interpreted as a prior vorticity distribution .",

    "given_.    assuming ergodicity , the statistical equilibrium state is now obtained by maximizing the relative entropy @xmath63 at fixed energy @xmath64 , circulation @xmath17 and mass @xmath16 ( robust constraints ) .",
    "the conservation of the casimirs has been replaced by the specification of the prior @xmath62 . from that point",
    ", we can repeat the calculations of @xcite with almost no modification .",
    "the only difference is that we regard the @xmath55 as given .",
    "writing @xmath65 , and accounting for the normalization condition @xmath66 , we find ( i ) that the statistical equilibrium state is a stationary solution of the sw equation ( ii ) that the detailed distribution of pv levels is given by the gibbs state @xmath67 where the partition function @xmath68 is determined by the local normalization condition .",
    "the distribution of the fluctuations of pv vorticity is the product of a universal boltzmann factor by a non - universal function @xmath62 fixed by the forcing .",
    "this is the same formula as in @xcite except that in the present formalism @xmath62 must be regarded as given _ a priori _ while in @xcite it was a function of the lagrange multipliers @xmath55 that had to be related _ a posteriori _ to the fine - grained moments imposed by the initial conditions .",
    "the equilibrium coarse - grained pv is @xmath69 the coarse - grained vorticity ( [ p7 ] ) can be viewed as a sort of _ superstatistics _ @xcite as it is expressed as a superposition of boltzmann factors ( on the fine - grained scale ) weighted by a non - universal function @xmath62 .",
    "we note that the @xmath70 relationship predicted by the statistical theory can take a wide diversity of forms ( usually non - boltzmannian ) depending on the prior @xmath62 .",
    "the function @xmath71 is entirely specified by the prior pv distribution according to @xmath72 differentiating eq .

    "we write the variational principle as @xmath88 using the results of @xcite , we have @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 where we have taken @xmath33 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 as independent variables .",

    "in the case of freely evolving flows , @xcite have proposed a thermodynamical parametrization of the sw equations ( on the coarse - grained scale ) in the form of relaxation equations that conserve all the constraints of the sw dynamics ( including the casimirs ) and increase the mixing entropy . in the case of flows that are forced at small - scales ,",

    "<S> we adapt the statistical mechanics of the shallow - water equations to the case where the flow is forced at small scales . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the statistics of forcing is encoded in a prior potential vorticity distribution which replaces the specification of the casimir constraints in the case of freely evolving flows . </S>",
    "<S> this determines a generalized entropy functional which is maximized by the coarse - grained pv field at statistical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> relaxation equations towards equilibrium are derived which conserve the robust constraints ( energy , mass and circulation ) and increase the generalized entropy .    </S>",
