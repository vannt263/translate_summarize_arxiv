    "photoelasticity is of interest from the fundamental point of view as well as for several technological applications in optics and microelectronics .",
    "for instance , photoelasticity in a - sio@xmath0 is known to cause a reduction of fiber bragg gratings efficiency @xcite and to produce a loss of resolution of pure silica lenses used in photolytography @xcite .",
    "moreover , photoelasticity is directly related to the rayleigh scattering coefficient in single - component glasses through the landau - placzek relation , and is thus one of the main contributions to loss in state - of - the - art silica fibers for telecommunications @xcite .",
    "a systematic experimental study of photoelasticity in pure and modified silica glass has been reported by schroeder in the early 80s.@xcite brillouin scattering measurements have shown that the modification of silica glass with alkali or alkali - earth ions ( li , na , k , ca , and mg ) reduces sizably the photoelastic coefficients.@xcite this result is in contrast with the prediction of simple models ( lorenz - lorentz ) based on the observed increase in density and refractive index with the modifier concentration . as expected , a related reduction of the rayleigh scattering coefficient",
    "was later measured for these glasses,@xcite and lines thus suggested their use as ultra - low loss glasses for telecommunication applications.@xcite    in a recent work @xcite we have shown that the photoelastic coefficients of crystalline and amorphous pure sio@xmath0 can be computed with good accuracy within density functional perturbation theory .",
    "a phenomenological model based on ab - initio data allowed us to identify the microscopic parameters which rule photoelasticity in pure a - sio@xmath0 . in the present paper",
    "we have applied the same ab - initio framework to compute the photoelastic tensor of a sodium silicate glass with composition ( na@xmath0o)@xmath1(sio@xmath0)@xmath2 ( ns3 ) aiming at identifying which modification either structural or electronic induced by the insertion of sodium is mostly responsible for the change in photoelastic response .",
    "models of ns3 glass containing 84 atoms have been generated by quenching from the melt in combined classical and car - parrinello molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the calculated photoelastic coefficients are in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "in particular , the calculation reproduces quantitatively the changes of the photoelastic response induced by the insertion of na , as measured experimentally . in order to identify the microscopic mechanims responsible for the change of the photoelastic response induced by na",
    ", we extended to ns3 the phenomenological model developed for pure a - sio@xmath0 in ref .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe our computational framework . in section iii",
    "we report the details of the structural and elastic properties of our model of ns3 .",
    "the results on the calculated photoelastic tensor and their interpretation in terms of a phenomelological model are presented in sections iv and v , respectively .",
    "section vi is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "a model of sodium silicate glass of composition ( na@xmath0o)@xmath1(sio@xmath0)@xmath2 ( ns3 ) has been generated within a combined classical and ab - initio framework which has been previously used to generate models of pure a - sio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "models of the glass have been generated by quenching from the melt in classical molecular dynamics simulations and then annealed for few ps within ab - initio car - parrinello molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "the same method has been used by ispas _",
    "@xcite to generate a theoretical model of sodium tetrasilicate glass ( ( na@xmath0o)@xmath3(sio@xmath0)@xmath4 , ns4 ) achieving good agreement with experiments both in the structural and electronic properties .",
    "@xcite used a modified bks - potential @xcite extended to sodium silicates by horbach _",
    "conversely , we have adopted the empirical potential developed by oviedo _",
    "@xcite which is an extension to sodium silicate glass of the forcefield introduced by vashista _",
    "@xcite for pure amorphous silica .",
    "it consists of a short - range two - body interaction , long - range coulomb interactions , and a three - body term which enforces the directionality of the si - o covalent bond .",
    "the na - si , na - o and na - na interactions have been modeled by oviedo _",
    "_ @xcite by coulomb interactions plus a repulsive short - range term .",
    "the effective charges of the coulombic potential are : 1.0 for na , 1.6 for si , and -0.971 for oxygen which enforces charge neutrality in ns3 ( note that there is a misprint in the oxygen charges in table i of ref .",
    "a model of liquid ns3 has been prepared by inserting 7 na@xmath0o and 21 sio@xmath0 units in a cubic box ( @xmath5=10.531  ) at the experimental density of glassy ns3 ( 2.427 g/@xmath6 ) .",
    "the system is equilibrated at 6800 k , cooled to 3800 k in 50 ps and then equilibrated at the final temperature for 5 ns .",
    "the sample is then quenched at room temperature in 5 ns ( quenching rate of 7@xmath710@xmath8 k / s ) and equilibrated at 300 k for 50 ps .",
    "this model has then been annealed at 600 k in car - parrinello simulations for 1.3 ps and then quenched at 300 k in 0.15 ps .",
    "structural properties have been averaged over a nve run at room temperature , 1.1 ps long .",
    "the ab - initio simulations are based on density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite as implemented in the code cpmd @xcite .",
    "norm - conserving pseudopotential for si and na have been used .",
    "non linear core corrections are included in na pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "an ultrasoft pseudopotential @xcite has been used for oxygen .",
    "kohn - sham ( ks ) orbitals are expanded in plane - waves up to a kinetic cutoff of 27 ry .",
    "integration of the bz has been restricted to the @xmath9 point . to study the dielectric properties , the structures generated by car - parrinello simulations",
    "have been then optimized with norm - conserving pseudopotentials and a larger cutoff of 70 ry .",
    "we have computed the dielectric and photoelastic tensors within density functional perturbation theory dfpt @xcite , as implemented in the code pwscf and phonons @xcite .",
    "the photoelastic tensor is defined by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the components of the optical dielectric tensor , @xmath12 is the strain tensor . only the electronic contribution",
    "is included in @xmath11 , also indicated as @xmath13 .",
    "experimentally , it corresponds to the dielectric response measured for frequencies of the applied field much higher than lattice vibrational frequencies , but lower than the frequencies of the electronic transitions .",
    "the photoelastic coefficients have been calculated by finite differences from the dielectric tensor of systems with strains from -1 @xmath14 to + 1 @xmath14 .",
    "the components of the photoelastic tensor will be expressed hereafter in the compressed voigt notation .",
    "the exchange - correlation functionals available in literature ( lda and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) ) usually underestimate the electronic band gap and overestimate the electronic dielectric tensor up to 10 - 15 @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be corrected semi - empirically by applying a self - energy correction , also referred to as a scissor correction , which consists of a rigid shift of the conduction bands with respect to the valence bands @xcite .",
    "this procedure has been used successfully to reproduce the photoelasticity of si @xcite , gaas @xcite and quartz @xcite . however , as shown in our previous work @xcite , it turns out that even within simple lda , the error in the photoelastic coefficients for several polymorphs of silica is smaller than what expected on the basis of the error in the dielectric constant itself .",
    "the scissor correction has thus been neglected in the calculation on ns3 reported here .",
    "as pointed out in previous works @xcite , the insertion of sodium modifies the topology of the network by the formation of non - bridging oxygens ( nbo ) .",
    "the number of nbo coincides roughly ( and in our small cell , exactly ) with the number of na atoms .",
    "all silicon atoms in our model are 4-fold coordinated and bonded at most with one nbo .",
    "the presence of nbo drastically reduces the number of medium sized rings ( 5 - 8 si atoms per ring ) which are usually predominant in the ring - size distribution of pure silica ( fig .",
    "[ ringns ] ) .        the structural properties of the final ab - initio model of ns3 are compared to those of the classical model ( before ab - initio annealing ) in figs .",
    "[ corrns ] , [ corrnbo ] and [ angns3 ] .",
    "pair correlation functions ( g(r ) ) and radial coordination numbers are shown in fig .",
    "[ corrns ] .",
    "the average si - o bond for nbo is slightly shorter than for bridging oxygen ions ( bo ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ nbo_bo_si ] which report @xmath15 resolved for bo and nbo .",
    "the ab - initio annealing produces a slight broadening of the pair correlation and angle distribution functions ( adf , fig .",
    "[ angns3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the three - body term in the classical potential assigns a tetrahedral geometry too stiff with respect to the ab - initio results .",
    "the o - si - o adf is still centered around the tetrahedral angle ( 109.5@xmath16 ) , while the si - o - si adf is centered at 139.3@xmath16 , which is smaller than the average si - o - si angle in pure silica . furthermore , in contrast with the classical models of pure silica generated with the bks potential ( cfr .",
    "@xcite ) no shift in the maximum of the @xmath17 ( sio , oo and sisi ) is observed upon ab - initio annealing .",
    "in fact , the vashista potential is fitted directly on the experimental @xmath17 of amorphous silica and the agreement with ab - initio bondlengths is better than for the bks potential .",
    "however , the ab - initio annealing shifts outwards the peak of the na - o correlation function ( from 2.4 to 2.5  ) . by separating the contribution of nbo and bo to the pair correlation functions ( fig .",
    "[ corrnbo ] ) we can see that the na atoms are closer to nbo than to bo . on average , a nbo is coordinated with 2.9 na ions and a bo with 1.3 na ions . on the other hand ,",
    "a na ion is on average coordinated with about 2.9 nbo and 3.35 bo ( cfr .",
    "[ corrns ] ) .",
    "looking at the na - na pair correlation function it is worth noting that the broad peak at 3.5   present in the classical md model , disappears in the cpmd simulation .",
    "thus , sodium does not tend to segregate or to form clusters , but it is homogeneously distributed in the network .",
    "after the ab - initio annealing performed with the softer vanderbilt pseudopotentials , the final structure has been further optimized with norm - conserving pseudopotentials ( for the calculations of the dielectric properties ) .",
    "the cell geometry has been optimized at fixed volume allowing orthorhombic distortions of the initially cubic supercell such as to produce a diagonal stress tensor .",
    "the residual anisotropy in the stress ( @xmath18 ) for the optimized ratios of cell edges @xmath19 and @xmath20 is @xmath21    the large negative stress in eq .",
    "[ sigma ] is due to the so  called pulay stress .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 ratios obtained in this way at the experimental equilibrium density have been held fixed and the volume varied to generate the equation of state reported in fig .",
    "[ eosns3 ] .",
    "the calculated @xmath24 points have been corrected for the discontinuities due to the incomplete basis set following the prescription given in ref .",
    "@xcite and then fitted by a murnaghan function @xcite .",
    "the resulting equilibrium density ( @xmath25 ) , bulk modulus ( @xmath26 ) and derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure ( @xmath27 ) are @xmath28 g/@xmath6 ( exp .",
    "@xmath29 g/@xmath6 ) , @xmath30 gpa , @xmath31 .",
    "the insertion of na produces a marginal softening of @xmath26 with respect to pure silica @xcite .",
    "in fact in our previous work @xcite on a model of a - sio@xmath0 of similar size ( 81 atoms ) we obtained in our previous work @xcite we have obtained @xmath32 g/@xmath6 , @xmath33 gpa , @xmath34 .",
    "the value of @xmath27 , negative in pure silica , turns to positive in ns3 , which means that the structural response to compression is different in silica and in ns3 .",
    "na - o interaction is probably responsible for the change in @xmath27 .    the response to strain ( @xmath35,@xmath36 ) of some average structural parameters of ns3 and of a - sio@xmath0 ( 81-atoms supercell )",
    "are compared in table [ str_res ] .",
    "the change in the siosi angles upon strain is substantially smaller in ns3 than in pure a - sio@xmath0 , nevertheless the response of the na - o distances to strain is rather relevant , if compared to the average si - o distance changes , both in pure silica and in ns3 .",
