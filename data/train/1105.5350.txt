    "wire interaction exceeds the length scale of the pairwise lj - interaction among two monomers , the wire is pushed outward and the globule is simply attached to the the wire [ this phase is called `` ge '' ( globular excluded ) , see fig .",

    "since additional contacts with the wire can only be formed along the wire axis , the polymer forms compact tubelike structures in this phase , see fig .",

    ", we will refer below only to the monolayer polymer tube structures formed in phase b. before embarking on the comparison of polymer tubes and carbon nanotubes , we briefly review relevant geometrical properties of swcnts .",
    "nanotubes are typically considered as rolled - up planar atomic sheets . a single - walled carbon nanotube ( swcnt )",
    "is commonly pictured as a zipped monolayer graphene sheet ( although , more detailed approaches exist  @xcite ) , crystallized on a hexagonal ( honeycomb ) lattice .",
    "all carbon atoms have the same distance from the tube axis and thus reside on a cylinder surface . in the original , conventional model ,",
    "the swcnt lattice was supposed to entirely cover a cylinder , thereby assuming curved hexagonal plates and bonds , neglecting the discrete nature of the lattice  @xcite . in a more realistic polyhedral decomposition approach , this is corrected by formulating constraints regarding c - c bond lengths and angles between them  @xcite .",
    "single - walled boron nanotubes ( swbnts ) possess an underlying triangular lattice structure and have also been described by cylindrical mappings  @xcite .",
    "energetically favored tube structures possess holes or are puckered , in which case the atoms do not lie on a surface of a single cylinder  @xcite .",
    "other , non - regular structures , have also been considered in theoretical studies of swbnts  @xcite .",
    "the triangular single - walled polymer tube ( swpt ) structures we find in the barrel phase of a polymer adsorbed at a nanowire exhibit strong similarities with ideal cylindrical swbnts . thus , for its geometrical description the ideal polyhedral model for with equal bond lengths  @xcite can easily be adopted . since the polymers tend to form highly regular tube structures , they are interesting candidates for carbon nanocomposites of polymers and swcnts . for these reasons , it is instructive to discuss the relationship of swcnts and swpts in the following .      in the unzipped , conventional representation , the chiral or wrapping vector @xmath33 pointing from any lattice site to its next copy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 - 3tubes ] ) uniquely characterizes any swcnt structure .",
    "the wrapping vector and the translational vector @xmath34 , perpendicular to @xmath33 , span the unit cell .",
    "it is convenient to introduce lattice vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( see fig .",

    "hence , the two integers @xmath42 and @xmath43 , usually written in the vector form ( @xmath44 ) , are sufficient to differentiate between swcnt structures .",
    "the wrapping orientation is defined by the characteristic wrapping or chiral angle @xmath45 between @xmath35 and @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath46 hence , @xmath45 can take values between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding limiting tube conformations for a given value of @xmath42 are usually called zigzag ( for @xmath49 ) or armchair conformation ( for @xmath50 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 - 3tubes ] , different visualizations of ( @xmath51 ) zigzag , chiral , and armchair carbon nanotube structures are shown .    in this conventional approach  @xcite",
    ", swcnts were assumed to be planar sheets of the @xmath52 unit cell wrapped around a cylinder and continued along the central axis .",
    "then , the length of @xmath33 corresponds to the circumference @xmath53 of this cylinder . since @xmath54 where @xmath55 corresponds to the c  c bond length ,",
    "the radius of the zipped swcnt is given by @xmath56 in this simple cylindrical mapping , the bond length is not conserved and discrete curvature effects are not correctly taken into account . however , the flatter the surface , i.e. , the larger @xmath42 , the more accurate this estimate is .    for structural investigations of realistic swcnts ,",
    "this difference is not of particular relevance .",
    "however , for our subsequent comparison and discussion of the relationship between triangular swpts and hexagonal swcnt shapes , the ( typically small ) deviations must be taken into consideration , because the structural characterization on the basis of the @xmath52 vector depends sensitively on this .",
    "assuming that the swcnt forms under the constraints of conserved c  c bond lengths , which are not necessarily all equal  @xcite , a discrete swcnt model can be derived .",
    "the obtained geometric tube structures are in good correspondence with ab initio predictions and molecular dynamics relaxation  @xcite .",
    "this model is also applicable to ultra - small nanotubes which resemble nanowires  @xcite .      in the tube phase ,",
    "polymers attracted by a thin wire form compact conformations . because of the elasticity and flexibility of the polymer model considered here , monomers are optimally packed in a triangular arrangement .",
    "unzipping such a polymer tube yields a regular triangular lattice , whose lattice vectors are identical with @xmath35 and @xmath36 introduced earlier for the definition of the wrapping vector @xmath57 of the swcnts .",
    "consequently , the @xmath52 notation for the characterization of swcnts can also be implemented to characterize the swpts .",
    "the polymer tubes we find in the monolayer barrel phase of our polymer  nanowire adsorption model can be well described by the ideal boron nanotube model  @xcite , where all bonds are considered to have an identical length @xmath58 .",
    "this assumption corresponds well to the definitions of the length scales of bonded and nonbonded interactions in the fene polymer model used in our study .",
    "thus , the systems can easily be mapped onto each other by the replacement @xmath59 .",
    "the polymers form monolayer tubes , if the adsorption strength overcompensates optimal three - dimensional nearest - neighbor packing of the monomers .",
    "if the adsorption strength is reduced to the extent that intrinsic attraction becomes competitive , the topologically two - dimensional monolayer is given up in favor of a double - layer structure extending into the third dimension .",
    "the polymer undergoes a topological transition , but keeps a barrellike form  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we only consider monolayer polymer tubes , as only in this conformational phase the analogy to carbon and ( idealized ) boron nanotubes is apparent .    adopting the equations from the idealized boron nanotube model  @xcite and the chiral notation @xmath52 from atomic nanotubes ,",
    "the radius of an @xmath52 polymer tube is given by @xmath60 where @xmath11 is the equilibrium monomer ",
    "monomer distance  @xcite and the corrected wrapping angle @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 the angles @xmath63 and @xmath64 are defined by projections of atom positions upon a circular slice perpendicular to the tube axis  @xcite .",

    "the calculation of the polyhedral radius is more challenging , as the honeycomb cell is not immune to shearing or tilting , as is a triangular lattice .",

    "this leads to an intuitive interpretation for the radius of triangular @xmath75-tubes . from the vanishing wrapping angle",

    "is @xmath80 , the lengths of the projected vectors are shortened by the factor @xmath81 . for the on - tube calculation of the bond length between two monomers , we make use of the fact that the projection angle in a triangular lattice does not change when zipping the planar sheet to a tube : @xmath82 both , eqs .",

    "( [ eq : psi ] ) implies @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath75 and @xmath74 tubes , respectively .",
    "note that it is not possible to apply similar arguments to calculate the correct radii of @xmath75 and @xmath74 swcnts , because the hexagon is not rigid , as the triangle is .",
    "thus distances between the atoms in the hexagon change when bending .",
    "indeed , for hexagonal honeycomb tubes ( swcnts ) one finds , when projecting bonds to planes perpendicular to the tube orientation , polygons with @xmath85 and @xmath79 edges for armchair and zigzag - tubes , respectively .",
    "but these polygons are not regular anymore , in the armchair case , and the lengths of the projections can not be calculated in such a straightforward way , due to minimal deformations caused by the curvature . however , applying such approximations and corresponding generalizations to @xmath52 tubes lead to the same qualitative results , such as the ( @xmath44 ) sequence for increasing radii , as shown below , for example .",
    "quantitative deviations from results of the polyhedral model are in the low per - mille range ( not shown ) .    generally , although the numerical differences of @xmath86 ( eq .",

    "however , the structures of the corresponding tubes are completely different , and in consequence , physical , i.e. , nanoelectronic , nanooptic and other material properties  @xcite , are in general different as well .",
    "hence , @xmath86 is not suitable to parametrize swcnts , whereas @xmath87 can uniquely be associated to any swcnt structure .",
    "a more detailed numerical analysis of the deviations between the conventional and the polyhedral approach is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , for the following discussion of similarities of swcnts and swpts , significant precision is required and therefore it is necessary to take into account these .",
    "since the triangular lattice formed by an unzipped swpt is obtained from a voronoi construction of the hexagonal lattice formed by the carbon atoms in an unzipped swcnt , it is appealing to investigate the mapping between these different systems .",
    "this is not only mathematically interesting , but might also have technological consequences for the design of particularly stable polymer coated carbon nanotubes or other nanohybrid structures including swcnts and complex molecules  @xcite .",
    "however , as we have discussed in the previous section , it is necessary to examine geometrical considerations on the tube itself and not on its unzipped form .",
    "this is not trivial due to the curvature and discrete nature of those systems , which affects , for example , the bending angles between the respective carbon atoms or monomers such that they generally differ in the unzipped planar shape and in the tube structure .",

    "[ tab:2 ] , results for ( 6,0 ) and ( 4,3 ) tubes are therefore listed in the same row .",
    "their radii in the polyhedral model differs by less than @xmath117 , which is reflected accordingly in our results . regarding the wrapping angles",

    ", we find transitions at the interfaces between two structural regions .",
    "we observe in the ensemble of low - energy states `` competing '' conformations , i.e. , different tube types with very similar ground state energies and tubes with defects or internal interfaces between regions belonging to different chirality classes , see fig .",

    "let us therefore comment on some actual structures we found earlier .    at @xmath118 , we found in a monolayer polymer conformation consisting of two competing substructures with different chirality and a defect at the interface between both substructures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:9](a ) )  @xcite .",
    "one region forms a @xmath119 tube , the other is a 4-helix with a measured mean wrapping angle of @xmath120 , which corresponds to a  @xmath121 tube .",
    "these observations fit in perfectly with the results presented above in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "both structures are neighbors in the radius - ordered sequence of tube structures",
    ". slight deviations of the value of the radius and the larger error of the mean wrapping angle trace back to the fact that we originally used a slightly different polymer model with fixed bond length ( sticks instead of elastic bonds ) where the optimal distance between two nonbonded monomers was slightly larger than the bond length .",
    "however , on the other hand , this indicates that our results are of general character and do not depend on certain details of the implemented polymer model .",
    "another conformation found in the earlier study was the , somewhat artificial , ( 1,1 ) tube at @xmath122 ( see fig .",

    "[ fig:9](c ) .",
    "there , we found a 12-helix with chiral angle of @xmath126 , which can now be assigned to a ( 8,4 ) tube ( not listed in table  [ tab:2 ] , but calculations lead to @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) .",
    "however , we also found in that region a strong competition between conformations with different structures as well as conformations composed of different substructures , as shown for example in figs .",
    "1 and  4 in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we find for example regions which can be explained to be parts of ( 7,5 ) tubes ( not in table  [ tab:2 ] , @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) .",
    "this structure forms also a 12-helix , but with just slightly different wrapping angle compared to ( 8,4 ) .",
    "finally , we find among those structures ( 10,1 ) tubes ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 forming 11-helices .",
    "note the small differences between @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "in this study , we have investigated the relationship between single - walled carbon nanotubes and the tube phase of a bead  spring polymer model attracted by a thin wire .",
    "in fact , we found surprisingly clear geometrical similarities between these different materials .",
    "we could only obtain our results by taking into account the discreteness and curvature effects in the mathematical description of the geometrical properties of nanotubes .",
    "hence , we provide an example for the necessity of applying accurate discrete models , rather than continuous approximations , in computational studies of nanotubes .    to strengthen our theoretical considerations on the link between carbon nanotubes and polymer nanotubes , we employed numerical optimization procedures to construct lowest - energy polymer conformations for given attraction length scales of the wire ( or , equivalently , given polymer tube radii ) . comparing those conformations",
    "based on a triangular lattice , with carbon nanotubes based on a hexagonal honeycomb lattice , we found that both share the same chirality sequence and we show how the length scales are connected .",
    "we addressed the problem of competing substructures leading to defects in non - ideal structures , which definitely merits further investigation .",
    "the perfect structural coincidence between atomic nanotubes and polymer tubes explains the internal structure of the barrel phase of polymers adsorbed at nanowires .",
    "it is also a good starting point for the further systematic investigation of hybrid systems of polymers and single - walled carbon nanotubes , which might be of technological interest for controlling , e.g. , physical properties of polymer - coated nanotubes .",
    "we have also presented further evidence , that helical conformations are intrinsic natural structures in simple polymer models  @xcite .",
    "our key result of the universal nature of the sequence of conformations in nanotubes and polymer tubes has developed from a series of simulations .",
    "such extensive 3d simulations have only recently become possible , and the situation is reminiscent of the discoveries in the seventies and early eighties as the picture of universality in critical phenomena emerged from the early numerical results of series expansions and simulations , and a very few experiments . with current and future computer power , the two directions mentioned above , namely the exploration of defective structures and the study of hybrid systems should lead into interesting theoretical and practical directions in polymer research and nanotechnology .",
