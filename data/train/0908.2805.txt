    "the field of quantum condensed matter has provided us with quantum many - body states that are nothing short of amazing . among the most remarkable are phases associated with a new paradigm  @xcite of topological order .",
    "these topological phases have a number of fascinating and technologically useful properties , such as quantized hall conductance and non - abelian quasi - particles . however , the precise conditions for a quantum topological phase to arise from a microscopic hamiltonian are unknown .",
    "the few known examples of topological order currently include the quantum hall states  @xcite , lattice spin models due to kitaev  @xcite , lattice versions of the quantized hall effect  @xcite , and related models of topological insulators  @xcite . while the physical systems that may host the nontrivial topological phases are quite different , their theoretical descriptions often formally reduce to that of a topological superconductor ( sc ) .",
    "_ e.  g. _ , the moore - read even - denominator fractional quantum hall wave - function is equivalent to the mean - field bcs state of a spinless @xmath5-wave sc @xcite .",
    "topological insulators and scs too can be related and classified on an equal footing  @xcite , by noticing that any sc is an insulator of its bogoliubov excitations , whose `` band structure '' is governed by bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian at the mean - field level .",
    "therefore , understanding topological superconductivity is an important issue both due to its many connections to a variety of seemingly unrelated topological phases and also in its own right , _",
    "e.  g. _ , in relation to the recent experimental observation of an exotic paired state in sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8  @xcite and proposals for realization of @xmath9-wave superfluids in cold atom systems  @xcite .",
    "topological scs , most notably @xmath5 models , have been considered in the theoretical literature in great detail .",
    "however , the starting point of all theoretical models has been a quadratic mean - field hamiltonian , with a predetermined topological order parameter of interest , or equivalently a reduced bcs hamiltonian with exotic interactions that are difficult to imagine being realized in the laboratory .",
    "such models are capable of answering some key questions related to the properties of a given topological phase , but they do not provide much guidance in the search of hamiltonians that would host those phases . in other words , these models are sufficient to produce nontrivial topological order by design , but do not shed light on the minimal necessary conditions for the emergence of topological order .",
    "in this paper we prove a general theorem that allows us to construct a large family of lattice models that give rise to topological superconducting states .",
    "we show that contrary to a common perception , the nontrivial topological phases do not necessarily arise from exotic hamiltonians , but instead appear naturally within a range of simple models of spinless ( or spin - polarized ) fermions with physically reasonable interactions .",
    "our theorem is based on examining the bcs free energy of possible paired states which is known to be asymptotically exact for weak coupling since bcs instability is an infinitesimal instability and the use of the jensen s inequality , which ensures that topological phases are often selected naturally by energetics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] , we introduce a general microscopic hamiltonian describing spinless fermions in two dimensional space and present the bcs mean field treatment of superconductivity in this model .",
    "the topological classification of 2d superconductors is reviewed in section [ class ] and the main energetics argument indicating that the topological paired states are energetically favorable is proven in section  [ theorem ] . in section  [ sec : lattice ] , we quantitatively study phase diagrams of two specific lattice fermion hamiltonians on a square lattice and triangular lattice with nearest - neighbor hoppings and interactions . the ground state of the square - lattice model is proven to be a topological @xmath5-wave sc at arbitrary filling . the triangular lattice model gives rise to a @xmath5-wave superconducting state guaranteed at low filling , but shows a first - order phase transition into a non - topological @xmath6-wave sc at intermediate fillings and another transition within the @xmath6-wave superconducting dome from a gapless to a fully gaped superconductor .",
    "we start our general discussion with the following single - band hamiltonian for spinless fermions @xmath10 where @xmath11/ @xmath12 are the fermion creation / annihilation operators corresponding to momentum @xmath13 , `` @xmath14 '' stands for `` brillouin zone , '' @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the dispersion relation of the fermions and @xmath17 the chemical potential , and @xmath18 describes an interaction , which is assumed to have an attractive channel .",
    "we assume that hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) arises from a real - space lattice or continuum model and is invariant with respect to the underlying spatial symmetry group , which we denote as @xmath1 , and the time - reversal group , @xmath0 .",
    "we note that in two dimensions ( 2d ) the range of possible spatial groups , @xmath1 , is limited to the following dihedral point - symmetry groups : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 in the case of a lattice or orthogonal group of rotations @xmath24 in continuum .",
    "we recall that the group @xmath25 includes @xmath26-rotations and in - plane reflections with respect to @xmath27 axes .",
    "the superconducting order parameter is classified according to the irreducible representations of the full group @xmath28 .",

    "this is a strong statement that is completely independent of microscopic details , such as hoppings and interactions , and relies only symmetry .",
    "it leads , in particular , to the conclusion that any single - band spinless sc ( and certain models of spin - polarized scs ) originating from a square lattice with singly - connected fs must be a @xmath5-paired state .",
    "similarly , any sc arising from spinless fermions in continuum must be of a @xmath90-type , which is topologically nontrivial .",
    "this includes all continuum models with attractive forces and conceivably some continuum models with weak repulsion that may give rise to pairing via kohn - luttinger mechanism  @xcite .",
    "since a large number of lattice fermion hamiltonians at low particle densities reduce to an effective single - band continuum model , it means that at least in this low - density regime any paired state is guaranteed to be topological .",

    "the square lattice case corresponds to the @xmath22 symmetry group , which has only a 2d representation .",
    "the attractive interaction guarantees that the ground state is a sc  @xcite and the general theorem  ( [ ineq ] ) guarantees that it is topologically non - trivial . to see how this happens in the specific model , we define two independent order parameters on horizontal and vertical links : @xmath97 , where @xmath98 or @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the corresponding lattice vector ( we use units where the lattice constant , @xmath101 ) .",

    "( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "we note that the mean - field bcs - type model can formally be considered for the extreme values of the non - interacting chemical potential @xmath133 , which is not associated with a non - interacting fs . hence , mean - field paired states in this limit are not topological and correspond to the strong - pairing ( abelian ) @xmath5-phase considered by read and green  @xcite .",
    "while such a mean - field bcs model is sensible in the context of the quantized hall state , it may be unphysical for fermion lattice models .",
    "indeed , the chemical potential , @xmath17 , is renormalized by non - bcs interactions or equivalently by superconducting fluctuations originating from the terms with @xmath134 in eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) .",
    "these strong renormalizations are bound to shift @xmath17 towards the physical values with a reasonable fermi surface , which in a metal is guaranteed by luttinger theorem .",
    "hence , it is not clear whether the abelian @xmath110 superconducting states may survive beyond mean - field . due to these arguments , we disregard here",
    "such case of non - topological @xmath110-paired states .",
    "we now derive bogoliubov - de gennes equations from the lattice model .",
    "these equations are often the starting point of discussions on bound states in a vortex core  @xcite and edge states  @xcite .",

    "this yields gives the desired bdg equations @xmath141 in principle , the order parameter @xmath142 should be determined via solving bdg equation self - consistently .",
    "however , we know that in a homogeneous ground state the order parameter has a @xmath110-wave pairing symmetry , i.e. , @xmath143 . if there are inhomogeneities in the system ( e.g. , vortices , domain walls ) the pairing symmetry ( associated with the relative phase between @xmath144 and @xmath145 components ) is not necessarily @xmath146 .",
    "but since this pairing symmetry is selected by energetics , we expect such deviation to be irrelevant for low energy physics .",
    "therefore we can assume that the relation @xmath143 holds for general configurations of order parameter at the mean - field level .",
    "this is equivalent to separation of the cooper pair wave function into parts corresponding to the center - of - mass motion and relative motion .",
    "now we take the continuum limit of : @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the effective mass and @xmath149 is the chemical potential measured from the bottom of the band . to treat the off - diagonal part",
    ", we formally represent the second term in eq .",

    "then , we expand to first order in @xmath155 and obtain the familiar bdg equations in continuum : @xmath156 where the gap operator @xmath157 .",
    "an interesting question to be addressed elsewhere is whether fluctuations and in particular deviations of pairing symmetry from @xmath146 play a role in the topological properties .",
    "we now address the very interesting case of a simple triangular lattice . here",
    "the @xmath23 symmetry group has both a 2d representation ( @xmath9-wave ) and two 1d representations ( @xmath6-wave ) .",
    "therefore , non - topological @xmath6-wave states are allowed .",
    "low `` electron '' densities correspond to a single circular - shaped fermi surface and must lead to the @xmath158-wave pairing per the same argument as above .",
    "however , the spectrum of the model is not particle - hole symmetric and at large fillings ( with @xmath159 ) , the electron fermi surface splits into two hole - like fermi pockets and maps onto an effective continuum model but with two fermion species : @xmath160 where @xmath161 are fermion operators near the two pockets labeled by a pseudospin index @xmath162 and the spectrum is asymptotically given by @xmath163    with @xmath164 measured from the corner points of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "note that under a @xmath165 or @xmath166 rotation , the spectrum transforms as @xmath167 and this symmetry is preserved if @xmath168 .",
    "this leads to a pairing analogous to the @xmath169-wave pairing of spin-@xmath170 fermions , with the order parameter of the inter - pocket pairing defined as @xmath171 .",
