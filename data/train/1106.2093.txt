    "the self - assembly of complex two - dimensional objects from simple constituent units plays an important role throughout condensed matter physics , materials science , and molecular biology .",
    "of particular importance for biology is the self - assembly of amphiphilic molecules into flexible bilayers @xcite which provide the structural basis for cell membranes .",
    "the physical properties of amphiphile bilayers are often studied using artificial bilayer vesicles @xcite of controlled molecular composition . in many settings @xcite the shape of such bilayer vesicles",
    "is characterized by a constant or smoothly varying curvature and minimizes the elastic energy of the vesicle . in experiment as well as theory @xcite , characteristic sequences of distinct vesicle shapes",
    "are obtained as a function of geometric parameters , such as the vesicle surface area at fixed vesicle volume , and elastic parameters , such as the bilayer spontaneous curvature .",
    "this has led to a general framework for the description and prediction of smooth vesicle shapes @xcite in which elasticity theory is combined with variational and perturbative methods for energy minimization .    in recent experiments",
    "@xcite , however , facetted bilayer vesicles with shapes reminiscent of polyhedra have been observed .",
    "polyhedra are characterized by flat faces connected by ridges and vertices with high local curvature , and are generally not regarded as being energetically favorable shapes of bilayer vesicles . in these experiments , two types of",
    "oppositely charged , single - tailed amphiphiles were used @xcite , with a slight excess of one amphiphile species over the other .",
    "consistent with the classic view of bilayer vesicles @xcite , the amphiphiles were found to self - organize into spherical bilayer vesicles at high temperatures . however , provided that the number of excess , unpaired amphiphiles was tuned to some optimal range @xcite , cooling the system below the chain melting temperature yielded the spontaneous formation of polyhedral bilayer vesicles .",
    "the bilayer polyhedra were reported to be stable over weeks , and to be consistently reproduced upon thermal cycling .",
    "furthermore , it was suggested @xcite that the observed polyhedral shapes had icosahedral symmetry , although some uncertainty regarding the polyhedral symmetry remained .",
    "finally , the vertices of polyhedral bilayer vesicles were found to exhibit pores @xcite , which was put forward @xcite as a mechanism for avoiding the large elastic bending energy associated with closed vertices of bilayer polyhedra .    on the basis of the experimental phenomenology",
    "it was suggested @xcite that minimization of elastic bending energy determines the shape of bilayer polyhedra . in a previous article @xcite we took these intriguing experimental observations as our starting point and investigated the minimal bending energies of bilayer polyhedra .",
    "we found that , while polyhedral vesicles can be energetically favorable compared to spherical vesicles for the bilayer composition used in the aforementioned experiments @xcite , the snub dodecahedron and the snub cube generally have lower elastic bending energies than the icosahedron .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to provide a more comprehensive discussion of the bending energies of bilayer polyhedra for various experimental scenarios , and allowing for different models of the elastic contributions to the free energy of bilayer polyhedra .",
    "our overall aim is thereby to provide basic estimates of the relative bending energies associated with different polyhedral symmetries , and to contrast these polyhedral bending energies with the elastic bending energy of spherical bilayer vesicles .",
    "the disagreement between experiment and theory concerning the most favorable polyhedral symmetry suggests that either the mechanism governing the shape of bilayer polyhedra is not solely minimization of elastic bending energy , or the dominant shape of the facetted bilayer vesicles observed in experiments does not correspond to the icosahedron .    to predict polyhedral shapes with minimal energy , a number of methodologies based on computer simulations",
    "have been developed over recent years @xcite .",
    "here we use a complementary method , in which we first derive general expressions for the contributions to the elastic bending energy of bilayer polyhedra due to the ridges , closed vertices , and vertex pores observed experimentally @xcite . particularly simple expressions of ridge , vertex , and pore energies are obtained from the helfrich - canham - evans free energy of bending @xcite .",

    "the bilayer polyhedra observed in experiments @xcite were composed of two different types of amphiphiles : myristic acid and cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide ( ctaoh ) .",
    "myristic acid carries a single negative charge while ctaoh is positively charged , and the hydrophobic parts of both amphiphile species consist of a single hydrocarbon chain . in a salt - free aqueous solution dilute in amphiphiles ,",
    "the two amphiphile species were observed to self - assemble into bilayers @xcite .",
    "the bilayers had a thickness of approximately 4  nm , and the inter - amphiphile spacing was found @xcite to be around 0.40.6  nm .",
    "while above the chain melting temperature the bending rigidity of the bilayers formed by myristic acid and ctaoh falls within the range 110 @xmath0 , cooling the system to room temperature yielded very stiff bilayers with rigidities greater than 100  @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in small - angle neutron scattering experiments it was indeed found @xcite that bilayers were nearly flat over a spatial length scale of more than 1  @xmath1 m .    in earlier work ,",
    "a mesoscopic model @xcite was used to further investigate the intriguing mechanical properties of the catanionic bilayers summarized above . in this model ,",
    "electrostatic interactions are described by a standard ising hamiltonian , while a spring network accounts for the formation of hydrogen bonds between amphiphiles .",
    "the behavior of bilayers obtained with this model is consistent with a simple picture @xcite of catanionic bilayers in which oppositely charged amphiphiles pair up to form zwitterionic amphiphiles with zero net charge and two hydrophobic tails , thereby expelling excess amphiphiles from flat bilayers . due to their molecular shape",
    ", such unpaired excess amphiphiles are expected to exhibit spontaneous curvature .",
    "it was estimated @xcite from the monolayer chain length of myristic acid that the induced spontaneous curvature of excess anionic amphiphiles is equal to around @xmath2  nm@xmath3 .    at high temperatures , mixtures of myristic acid and ctaoh",
    "were found to self - assemble into spherical bilayer vesicles @xcite .",
    "as the system is cooled below the chain - melting temperature , the behavior of these vesicles can be characterized @xcite by the fraction of the anionic amphiphile component over total amphiphile content , which we will denote by @xmath4 . using electron and light microscopy",
    "it was found that , if @xmath5 , spherical bilayer vesicles may facet to form polyhedral shapes or break up to form flat bilayer disks . both of these aggregate shapes may coexist with spherical bilayer vesicles .",
    "while the diameter of bilayer disks was observed @xcite to vary from 30  nm to 3  @xmath1 m , the diameters of bilayer polyhedra were reported @xcite to fall within a characteristic range of 12  @xmath1 m .",
    "bilayer polyhedra are estimated @xcite to contain around @xmath6 catanionic pairs and an excess of myristic acid corresponding to around @xmath7 single amphiphiles .",
    "electron and fluorescence microscopy studies have suggested @xcite that bilayer polyhedra exhibit pores at their vertices . by bleaching fluorescent molecules inside bilayer polyhedra and measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ,",
    "the pore diameter was estimated @xcite to be equal to around 40  nm .",
    "however , in the same set of experiments it was also found that some of the observed polyhedral vertices were in fact closed . finally , on the basis of electron and confocal microscopy a classification of the symmetry of bilayer polyhedra was attempted .",
    "some features of the observed polyhedral shapes , including their hexagonal cross section and five - fold vertex geometry , were found to be consistent with an icosahedral symmetry , but there was also considerable heterogeneity in the observed polyhedral shapes @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we distinguish between three basic types of contributions to the free energy of bilayer polyhedra .",
    "first , there are elastic contributions to the free energy associated with the energy required to bend amphiphile bilayers along the ridges and closed vertices of polyhedra , and to bend amphiphile monolayers along the edges of polyhedral pores . for a given polyhedral symmetry and size ,",
    "the total energetic cost associated with these terms depends on the elastic parameters characterizing the bilayer and on the geometric parameters defining the polyhedral shape .",
    "the total elastic energy of bilayer polyhedra is to be compared with the elastic energy associated with bilayer vesicles exhibiting a constant or smoothly varying curvature . in particular ,",
    "if no constraints on the vesicle surface area or the vesicle volume are imposed , and the bilayer composition is homogeneous , the classic framework for the description of smooth vesicle shapes implies @xcite that spherical bilayer vesicles minimize bending energy .",
    "a second class of contributions to the free energy of bilayer polyhedra arises from the entropic cost of segregating excess amphiphiles along polyhedral ridges and vertices .",
    "these entropic terms make the formation of bilayer polyhedra with defined amphiphile domains unfavorable compared to homogeneous bilayer vesicles .",
    "however , considering the experimental observation @xcite of segregated domains of excess amphiphiles along polyhedral ridges and vertices , entropic contributions do not seem to be dominant .",
    "indeed , the picture of heterogeneous bilayers presented in refs .",
    "@xcite suggests that excess amphiphiles are segregated during the cooling down process , leading to the separation of amphiphile bilayers into distinct domains which do not mix at low temperatures .",
    "here , we will not be concerned with the precise mechanism leading to the segregation of amphiphile domains , and assume that bilayers formed by myristic acid and ctaoh do indeed spontaneously expel excess amphiphiles during the cooling down process .",
    "third , we need to consider electrostatic contributions to the free energy of bilayer polyhedra . on the one hand ,",
    "segregated excess amphiphiles carry charges of equal sign and , hence , repel each other .",
    "thus , in addition to entropic effects , the mechanism leading to amphiphile segregation must overcome electrostatic repulsion between excess amphiphiles .",
    "on the other hand , the finite surface charge density observed along the ridges and vertices of bilayer polyhedra @xcite induces screening clouds in the surrounding solution .",
    "different membrane shapes lead to different shapes of the screening clouds which , as discussed further in sec .",
    "[ secgen ] , can affect the energetic cost associated with polyhedral ridges and pores . however , electrostatic contributions to the bending rigidity of amphiphilic bilayers are expected @xcite to be of the order of 110 @xmath0 and , hence , at least one order of magnitude smaller than the experimental values @xcite of the bending rigidity of bilayer polyhedra .",
    "this suggests @xcite that the electrostatic energies associated with deformations of the screening cloud are small compared to the membrane bending energy .",
    "thus , we will follow here ref .  @xcite and assume that the shape of bilayer polyhedra is governed by minimization of elastic bending energy .",
    "in this section we derive simple phenomenological expressions for the bending energies associated with the ridges , closed vertices , and vertex pores of bilayer polyhedra .",
    "our starting point is the helfrich - canham - evans free energy of bending @xcite , namely , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the bilayer bending rigidity , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the two principal radii of curvature , and @xmath12 is the bilayer spontaneous curvature . in situations where we consider amphiphile monolayers instead of amphiphile bilayers , @xmath9 in eq .",
