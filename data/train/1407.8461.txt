    "the size distribution of a fragment is a statistical quantity characterizing the fragmentation process .",
    "for example , when a material is fractured by an external force such as in impact fragmentation , size distribution is known to show a power - law or log - normal distribution @xcite . in these types of fragmentation process",
    ", the subdivision process of fragments is stopped immediately . in this case , the characteristic quantities of power law or log - normal law are determined by the properties of the material . in particular , the log - normal distribution can be simply explained by the gibrat process @xcite , a discrete - time stochastic process .",

    "there are few studies that concentrate on the size distribution in this scenario .",

    "in this situation , the characteristic values of the size distribution are determined not only by the material properties but also the external environment .",

    "@xcite simulated a continuum model of the fracture process of drying viscoelastic thin paste and showed that the time series of the area distributions of a fragment can be collapsed into a single master curve by scaling with the average value .",
    "this scaling law is called a `` dynamical scaling law '' and can not be expressed in terms of the original gibrat process because the resultant lognormal distribution includes two parameters of the average @xmath8 and the variance @xmath17 .",
    "generally there is no relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; the lognormal distribution therefore can not be scaled by the average alone .    in this article , we investigate the dynamical scaling law in the fragmentation process of desiccation using a stochastic model based on the gibrat process . while the original gibrat process clearly can not describe the dynamical scaling law , understanding the statistical properties of a fragmentation process is straightforward . in this article , we therefore model the fragmentation process of drying paste by a stochastic process that extends the gibrat process .",
    "while in the original gibrat process the effect of desiccation is not taken into account , we here incorporate it as the `` lifetime '' of the fragments .",
    "thus , the breaking event does not occur simultaneously but is instead dependent on the lifetime of each fragment .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the proposed stochastic model based on the gibrat process is introduced .",

    "[ sec : appa ] we calculate the lifetime of the fragments based on elastic theory .",
    "in the original gibrat process , each fragment breaks after a constant time interval . when considering fragmenting material , the time interval is generally not constant , but rather expected to depend on fragment size ( expressed as length , area , or volume ) .",
    "the time interval between two successive breaking events of a fragment is termed its `` lifetime '' and is a function of fragment size .",
    "introducing lifetime into the original gibrat process yields a stochastic process referred to as `` modified gibrat process '' in the following .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that lifetime is a function of fragment size , @xmath20 , which we denote as @xmath21 .",
    "we use a power function and a logarithmic function as the functional form of the lifetime : @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the characteristic time and size , respectively(see fig .",

    "briefly , @xmath108 is a function of the square of the characteristic length of the fragment and therefore is described as a function of fragment area .",
    "it is dependent on the inverse function of `` desiccation stress '' @xmath109 .",
    "desiccation stress is the time - increasing negative hydrostatic pressure due to the evaporation of liquid content and corresponds to the specific drying process .",

    "a linear or exponential function is often used as desiccation stress @xmath110 .",
    "results in the present study yield the dynamical scaling law if @xmath110 is determined by a linear function , but not in the case of an exponential function .",
    "the functional form of @xmath110 depends on the drying process as desiccation stress has a strong correlation with the amount of liquid content . in experiments using natural drying crack patterns ( i.e. no artificial drying procedure",
    "is applied ) , the dynamical scaling law appears to be observed .",
    "while it may therefore be expected that @xmath110 is a power function in the natural drying case , it can not be confirmed the functional form due a lack of experimental studies .",
    "we surmise that it is a linear function .",

    "in this section , the lifetime of a drying fragment is discussed analytically .",
    "we derive the relationship between lifetime and fragment size from elastic theory , considering the fragmentation process of viscoelastic paste by a desiccation process .",
    "we consider a quasi - two - dimensional viscoelastic continuum attached to a flat base .",
    "it is assumed that the motion of the material is over - damped due to a strong viscosity and that the drying speed is sufficiently slower than the typical velocity scale of the material dynamics . because it adheres to the base , the material is also subject to a resistance force proportional to the displacement field .",
    "let @xmath111 and @xmath112 denote the displacement field and the stress tensor , respectively .",
    "in the over - damped case , elastic and resistance forces are balanced . then the motion equation becomes @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a proportional constant of the resistance force , which can be evaluated as @xmath115 with the second lam constant @xmath116 and the thickness of the paste @xmath117.@xcite from the above assumptions , the constitutive equation of the stress can be approximated as a linear elastic equation .",
    "in addition , an increasing stress is introduced into the diagonal term of the stress tensor as an effect of desiccation .",
    "the constitutive equation is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the first and second lam constant , respectively , and @xmath121 is an unit tensor .",
    "@xmath122 is the effect of the desiccation .",
    "this term works as a negative pressure physically caused by the evaporation of the inner liquid . @xmath123 and",
    "@xmath24 denote characteristic stress and time , respectively .",
    "@xmath124 is an arbitrary increasing function . due to this negative pressure",
    ", tension develops within the material .",
    "this tension conflicts with the resistance force due to adhesion . as a consequence",
    ", stress concentration appears in the material .",
    "it is assumed that the fragment starts to break when the inner stress exceeds a threshold value @xmath125 .",
    "the `` lifetime '' is defined by the interval between the time when the fragment is created and the time when it starts to break , , and can be calculated using eqs .   and .",
    "in the present case we do not need to calculate the general and exact solution , but rather a rough estimation .",
    "when fragment size is characterized by @xmath126 with a characteristic length @xmath127 , the characteristic scale of changing the displacement field and stress field can also be described by @xmath127 .",
    "lifetime can then also be calculated by means of dimensional analysis .",
    "let @xmath128 and @xmath129 denote the characteristic scale of the displacement field and stress field , respectively .",
    "eqs .   and",
    "can be rewritten as follows : @xmath130    eliminating @xmath128 from eqs .   and",
    ", we obtain @xmath129 as @xmath131 where @xmath132 .",
    "this quantity represents the length scale of the stress , which characterizes how deep the influence of the boundary penetrates into the interior of the material . because the lifetime is defined as the time when @xmath129 exceeds @xmath125 from @xmath133 , lifetime @xmath108 is determined as follows : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is an inverse function of @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath108 shows asymptotic behavior , as @xmath127 becomes smaller as the fragmentation is proceeding . for the case of @xmath136 ( i.e the earlier state of fragmentation ) , the second term in the argument of @xmath137",
    "can therefore be ignored .",
    "as @xmath127 decreases asymptotically , the second term becomes the dominant contribution to @xmath108 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath108 is thus as follows : @xmath138 this behavior is consistent with the physical interpretation of @xmath139 : if the system size @xmath127 is greater than @xmath139 , the inner stress increases without being effected by the boundary conditions , and @xmath108 becomes a constant value depending on @xmath125 . in the opposite case ,",
    "the inner stress is affected by the influence of the boundary conditions - in other words , the desiccation stress may decrease effectively because of the boundary . in this case , @xmath108 becomes much larger than in the previous case .",
    "the case of a constant lifetime corresponds to the gibrat process , thus the fragmentation process in the early stage follows this process .",
    "after the early stage(when @xmath140 ) , the lifetime depends on the characteristic length of the fragment @xmath127 . in this stage , we can expect dynamical scaling for the power - function lifetime .",
    "the validity of the above dimensional analysis can be confirmed in the simple case of a disk - shaped fragment . in this situation ,",
    "we can obtain the exact solution of eqs   and .",
    "assuming a disk fragment with a radius @xmath141 , it is assumed for initial conditions that @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and that normal stress on the boundary is zero .",
    "the lifetime can be calculated exactly and is given by @xmath144^{-1 } \\rb \\nonumber\\\\      & \\sim\\begin{cases }          \\tau f^{-1}\\lb \\dfrac{\\sigma_{y}}{f_{0}}\\rb = \\text{const . } & \\qquad \\text{if } \\;\\ ; r\\gg\\lambda_{d } \\\\          & \\\\",
