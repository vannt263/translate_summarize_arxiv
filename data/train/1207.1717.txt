    "particle physics entered a new era with the announcement of the discovery of a new boson @xcite based on excess events in several higgs search channels using @xmath4 @xmath5 lhc data collected in 2011 - 2012 . in light of this discovery ,",
    "it has become obvious that the question of central importance to address now is ",
    "what are the properties of the scalar field responsible for the observed excesses ?",
    "the answer to this question determines if this field corresponds to the standard model ( sm ) higgs , with the specific sm mechanism of elegantly breaking electroweak ( ew ) symmetry , or whether a more complicated mechanism is involved in ew symmetry breaking .",
    "we study this question in detail in this paper , characterizing to what degree a sm higgs is consistent with the current global dataset and presenting several results on the properties of the scalar field .",
    "besides updating and expanding our past results @xcite , we also present new analyses that emphasize the power of the growing dataset to bound and rule out alternative models or to give hints of new physics ( np ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that it is very important to specify ( and justify ) a coherent theoretical framework in which to study the emerging evidence for the scalar field .",
    "however , without knowing the ultraviolet ( uv ) origin of this field , we do not know what effective field theory ( eft ) , or complete model , should be used to fit the data .",
    "we emphasize that at this time , the existing experimental evidence is not sufficiently strong to directly assume that the scalar resonance is the sm higgs boson , ascribing any deviations in the measured properties of the scalar field directly to the effects of np interactions expressed through higher dimensional operators .",
    "although this is certainly one possible interpretation of the data ( and we will examine the implications of higgs data for np in this framework ) , we emphasize that , in general , one should not assume what one wishes to prove",
    ".    nevertheless , in formulating a theoretical framework for this study , a wealth of other experimental results that are also sensitive to the properties of scalar fields at the weak scale can be distilled into simple physical guiding principles .",
    "these are , namely , approximate minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) @xcite ; respecting the soft higgs theorems of refs .",
    "@xcite ( i.e. the scalar couples to the sm fields in proportion to their masses ) ; and an effective breaking of custodial symmetry , @xmath6 , @xcite approximately as in the sm . directly incorporating these principles in the formulation of the effective lagrangian",
    "allows us to restrict our attention to a few simple cases . in order to establish experimentally the properties of the scalar resonance in a model - independent way",
    ", one can utilize the effective field theory of the chiral ew lagrangian coupled to a scalar field that was emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite to study recent higgs signal - strength data . depending on the assumptions of the uv origin of such a lagrangian ,",
    "one is lead to various sets of free parameters to fit the data when studying the consistency of the sm higgs hypothesis with the current dataset .",
    "we discuss and utilize this framework extensively in this paper to examine the properties of the scalar field emerging from the data .",
    "we also emphasize that with the discovery of a new scalar resonance , one can also use the signal strength properties of the scalar field to bound and rule out models that provide @xmath7 signal events as well as models that provide too many signal events .",
    "further , one can also exclude allowed parameter space due to the degree of tension within the dataset that depends on the properties of the scalar field .",
    "as the dataset evolves , these techniques become complementary to direct @xmath8 fits on the signal strength dataset .",
    "these bounds can be quantified by excluding parameter space in the allowed couplings of the scalar using a gaussian probability density function approach .",
    "we develop and apply such an approach in this paper .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ frameworks ]",
    "we discuss the eft framework we employ , and the implicit assumptions about the uv origin of the scalar field that are adopted when fitting the data with various free parameters .",
    "in section [ data ] we review and discuss the manner in which we treat the scalar signal strength data and electroweak precision data ( ewpd ) , while in section [ results ] we present results , based on our fit method , of the status of the sm higgs hypothesis . in section [ bsm ] we discuss some of the implications of higgs signal strength parameters for beyond the sm ( bsm ) physics , expressed through model - independent free parameters . in section [ tension ]",
    "we discuss novel and complementary methods to identify the allowed parameter space , and in section [ concl ] we conclude .",
    "an effective chiral ew lagrangian with a nonlinear realization of the @xmath9 symmetry gives a minimal description of the ( non - scalar ) degrees of freedom of the sm consistent with the assumptions of sm - like @xmath6 violation and mfv .",
    "the goldstone bosons eaten by the @xmath10 are denoted by @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 ) , and are grouped as ( x ) = e^i _ a ^a / v , with @xmath13 the pauli matrices and @xmath14 . in this approach , the ew scale @xmath15 , which sets the mass of fermions and gauge bosons",
    "is introduced directly into the lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath16 field transforms linearly under @xmath17 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 indicate the transformation on the left and right under @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , while @xmath6 is the diagonal subgroup of @xmath17 .    adding a scalar field @xmath22 to this theory is trivial .",
    "one chooses @xmath22 to transform as a singlet under @xmath6 and a derivative expansion of such a theory is given by @xcite _ eff & = & ( _ h)^2 - v(h ) + ( d_^ d^ ) , + & & - ( |u_l^i |d_l^i ) (    c y_ij^u u_r^j + y_ij^d d_r^j    ) + h.c . , [ leff ] with v(h ) & = & m_h^2 h^2 + ( ) h^3 + ( ) h^4 + .",
    "[ eq : efflag ] although we use the notation @xmath22 , we do not assume in principle that this scalar field is the higgs , or that the scale @xmath15 is somehow associated with the vacuum expectation value of this field  as this is what we seek to establish from the data .",
    "as is well known , the @xmath23 and @xmath24 parameters control the couplings of @xmath22 to gauge bosons and fermions , respectively , and therefore , play a crucial role in the phenomenology of single @xmath22 production . note that in previous fits , and in the majority of this work , the assumption @xmath25 is used and no distinction is made between the rescaling of the @xmath22-coupling to the @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks .",

    "this lagrangian is common in the study of composite models and its relevance has been emphasized recently in refs .",
    "it is also appropriate to study a pseudo - goldstone boson ( pgb ) emerging out of an approximately conformal sector @xcite , or as the low - energy eft arising in many scenarios where the higgs is a composite pgb that emerges from the breaking of a larger chiral symmetry group @xcite .",

    "note , however , that relaxing the assumption @xmath28 significantly , can lead to conflict with precision constraints sensitive to @xmath6 and flavour violation . ]",
    "we approach the data in this way to be as model - independent as possible .",
    "however , even specifying the free parameters that one will use to fit the data introduces implicit model dependence .",
    "one can nevertheless broadly characterize certain parameter choices . as this is an eft ,",
    "@xmath29 is non - renormalizable . here ( and throughout this paper ) we take the cut - off scale to be @xmath30 .",
    "since we are concerned with the phenomenology of single scalar production , the higher - order derivative operators are suppressed by powers of @xmath31 . as such ,",
    "we are justified in neglecting such sub - leading effects in this paper .",
    "non - derivative higher - dimensional operators will also exist in general . when the @xmath22 field is not assumed to have a uv origin such as the sm higgs , and is simply considered to be a singlet field [ that need not necessarily transform under the nonlinearly realized @xmath32 symmetry ]",
    ", the leading operators in the expansion in inverse powers of @xmath33 appear at dimension five and are given by ^5_hd & = & - h g^a _ g^a - h w^a _ w^a - h b _ b^ . here",
    "@xmath34 are the weak hypercharge , @xmath35 and @xmath36 gauge couplings , respectively , and the different tensor fields are the corresponding field strengths with their associated wilson coefficients @xmath37 .",
    "the scale @xmath33 corresponds to the mass scale of the lightest new state that is integrated out , which we assume is proximate to @xmath33 .",
    "we will neglect operators originating from cp - violating sources due to the lack of any clear evidence of beyond the sm cp violation in lower energy precision tests .",
    "note that the operators in @xmath38 can be further suppressed compared to the effects of @xmath39 on ( single ) scalar production when the scalar field has specific uv origins .",
    "this is the case for example when @xmath22 is a pgb , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "when one assumes that @xmath22 is embedded into an @xmath20 doublet - @xmath40 - as in the sm , the operators in @xmath38 first appear at dimension six , and the coefficients are suppressed by an extra factor of @xmath41 when considering single scalar production . in this case , the dimension six operator basis is also extended by the operator ^6_hd & = & - h^ ^a h b _ w^a . for phenomenological purposes",
    "it is convenient to rotate to a basis for the operators given by [ phenolagrangian ] _ hd & = & - h g^a _ g^a - h f _ f^ , where @xmath42 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor and @xmath43 in the case of an @xmath20 singlet field , and @xmath44 if @xmath22 is embedded into an @xmath20 doublet .    in this manner",
    ", one can understand that the choices to retain the effects of higher dimensional operators ( or not ) in performing global fits introduces implicit uv dependence",
    ". in introducing higher dimensional operators , one is also explicitly assuming the existence of new states charged under at least a subgroup of the sm group . alternatively ,",
    "if np is uncharged under the sm group but couples to the @xmath45 operator , then it can impact @xmath22-phenomenology by inducing an invisible @xmath22-width ( when the scalar field takes a vacuum expectation value ) .",
    "this leads to the modification of the sm branching ratios for each decay into visible sm final states @xmath46 via ( h f ) ( 1 - br_inv ) _ sm(h f ) .",
    "[ eq : brinv ] we will update our recent fit of @xmath47 to higgs search data @xcite in a later section , and use this fit as a diagnostic tool to test aspects of our fit procedure .    in general , the coefficients @xmath48 are arbitrary parameters subject to experimental constraints .",
    "the generic cases we consider are :    * composite / pseudo - goldstone higgs / dilaton scalar theories . in this case ,",
    "@xmath39 are free parameters in general , although they can be fixed in particular uv completions . if the scalar field is a pseudo - goldstone boson , it is also appropriate to neglect higher dimensional operators .",
    "we will fit to subsets of the parameters @xmath49 in what follows . as this is a more general framework than the sm higgs",

    "( [ leff ] ) to the sm higgs lagrangian . in this case @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the only effect of np is through non - renormalizable higher - order operators .",
    "the naturalness problem of the sm higgs mass operator , and recent experimental hints of deviations in the observed properties of the ( assumed ) higgs , motivates moderately heavy np and the introduction of bsm parameters @xmath52 as free parameters .",
    "we study the constraints on these parameters in detail in this paper .    we will not attempt to relate the constraints obtained on the various parameters to any particular underlying model , other than the sm , in this paper .",
    "this choice is motivated by the current lack of other clear experimental evidence of bsm states to guide coherent model - building .",
    "the classes of models discussed above can be considered as motivating examples .",
    "in this section we describe our method for globally fitting to the parameters discussed above , and incorporating the recently released @xmath53 tev data @xcite , updated @xmath54 tev results from atlas @xcite , the released 7 tev cms data @xcite , and the recently reported tevatron higgs search results @xcite .",

[ fig.data ] ) . in extensions of the sm , like the two - parameter scenario @xmath92 we have discussed in previous sections , the rescaling of the different channels ( which affects @xmath212 as explained in section [ mudata ] ) can introduce very significant distortions in the pdfs and cause too large tensions for some other channels .",

    "besides these channels , there is @xmath236 tension also from @xmath237 at 7 tev and from @xmath238 at 8 tev .",
    "the fact that the tension limits are straight lines passing through the origin is due to the fact that any common rescaling of @xmath23 and @xmath135 ( that leaves @xmath239 invariant ) also leaves invariant the tension associated to any channel as the latter are functions of ratios @xmath240 , and such ratios are also functions of @xmath239 .",

    "we also see that there are regions of parameter space that are not excluded by the conventional upper ( or lower ) limits imposed on the signal strength parameter , yet can be excluded by the tension exclusion limit .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the dataset can contain two widely separate channels and still give a combined pdf that respects the upper limit , which is not able to probe in such cases the internal inconsistency of the individual channels .",

    "as the relative weights of the various contributions to the inclusive higgs production processes depend on the operating energy of the lhc , we need separate information on @xmath54 and @xmath0 data to perform our fit as the relative fraction of events at each operating energy depends on the unknown parameters @xmath242 .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 lhc higgs search data just released indicates the existence of a scalar resonance with mass @xmath1 . we examine the implications of the data reported by atlas , cms and the tevatron collaborations on understanding the properties of this scalar by performing joint fits on its couplings to other standard model ( sm ) particles . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss and characterize to what degree this resonance has the properties of the sm higgs , and consider what implications can be extracted for new physics in a ( mostly ) model - independent fashion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , if the higgs couplings to fermions and weak vector bosons are allowed to differ from their standard values , the sm is @xmath2 from the best fit point to the current data . </S>",
    "<S> fitting to a possible invisible decay branching ratio , we find @xmath3 . we also discuss and develop some ways of using the data in order to bound or rule out models which modify significantly the properties of this scalar resonance , and apply these techniques to the current global dataset . </S>"
