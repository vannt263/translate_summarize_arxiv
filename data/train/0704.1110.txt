    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is believed to have a self - similar hierarchical structure over several orders of magnitude in scale @xcite .",
    "direct h  i absorption observations and interstellar scintillation measurements suggest that the structure extends down to a scale of 10 au @xcite and possibly even to a scale of sub - au @xcite . however , the latter is limited by the spatial resolution of the observations .",
    "hence the issue is far from being definite even after observational detection of lower limit of self - similarity scale in some ism components @xcite .",
    "numerous theories have attempted to explain the origin , evolution and mass distribution of these clouds ( began with the hierarchical fragmentation picture , * ? ? ? * ) and it has been established , from both observations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite , that the interstellar medium has a clumpy hierarchical self - similar structure with a fractal dimension @xmath0 @xcite in 3 dimensional space .",
    "the main reason for this is still not properly understood but can result from the underlying fractal geometry that may arise due to turbulent processes in the medium .",
    "here we have investigated physical processes , in particular hydrodynamics , in such a medium with fractal dimension .",
    "we have considered the simplest situation of hydrodynamic spherical steady accretion of the medium onto a large gravitating mass embedded in this medium .",
    "we have assumed the dimensionality of the medium to be isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "it implies that the mass density ( or , equivalently , dimensionality ) is same for any surface independent of the orientation .",
    "the famous solution of the continuous medium case is the `` bondi solution '' for spherical hydrodynamic accretion @xcite .",
    "here we have extended that analysis for a medium with fractal dimension @xmath1 .    to describe physical processes in fractal medium ,",
    "we have used fractional integration and differentiation ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "the interpretation of fractional integration is connected with fractional mass dimension @xcite .",
    "fractional integrals can be considered as integrals over fractional dimension space ( up to a numerical factor ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have chosen the numerical factor properly to get the right dimension of any physical parameter and to derive the standard expression in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "the isotropic and homogeneous nature of dimensionality is also incorporated properly .",
    "this model allows us to describe the hydrodynamics in a self - consistent way in a fractal medium .    in this paper",
    "we first derive , in  2 , the steady state mass accretion rate for fractal spherical hydrodynamic accretion using simple dimensional analysis . in ",
    "3 we derive the steady state hydrodynamic equations to describe the spherical accretion in a fractal medium and the steady state accretion rate in terms of boundary conditions at infinity is derived in  4 .",
    "we discuss the actual astrophysical implication of our analysis and compare our central result with observational data and numerical simulation results in  5 .",
    "possible limitations of our analysis is discussed in  6 .",
    "finally , we summarize and present our conclusions in  7 .",
    "we assume a medium that , on a range of length scale @xmath3 , has a fractal structure of dimensionality @xmath4 embedded in 3 dimensional space . here",
    "@xmath5 refers to the mass dimension and it implies that in such a medium of constant density @xmath6 , the mass enclosed in a sphere of radius @xmath7 will be @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a characteristic inner length of the medium and can take arbitrary value in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "it is the scale below which the medium will be continuous .",
    "we can define the modified `` density '' for this fractal medium as @xmath11 so that @xmath12 .",
    "for steady state hydrodynamic spherical accretion onto a central mass @xmath13 from its surroundings fractal medium with a mass dimension of @xmath5 , the relevant physical parameters will be ( 1 ) sound speed at a large distance away from the accretor ( @xmath14 ) , ( 2 ) modified `` density '' of the fractal medium at a large distance away from the accretor ( @xmath15 ) and ( 3 ) mass of the accretor scaled by the gravitational constant ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the dimensions of these three parameters are @xmath17=[m]^ { 0}[l]^ { 1}[t]^ { 1}\\ ] ] @xmath18=[m]^ { 1}[l]^{-d}[t]^ { 0}\\ ] ] @xmath19=[m]^ { 0}[l]^ { 3}[t]^{-2}.\\ ] ] it is possible to uniquely construct , from these parameters , a quantity @xmath20 with dimension @xmath21^ { 1}[l]^ { 0}[t]^{-1}$ ] .",
    "so , from simple dimensional analysis we get the mass accretion rate @xmath22 dimension analysis can not be used to fix the dimensionless constant @xmath23 in the above equation and does not give a detailed physical picture .",
    "but we have used the fractional integrals to derived , in a more detailed analysis in the following sections , the mass accretion rate and found that to be consistent with the accretion rate derived from the dimensional analysis .",
    "the integrals on network of fractals can be approximated by fractional integrals @xcite and the interpretation of the fractional integration is connected with fractional mass dimension . we consider the fractional integrals as integrals over fractional dimension space ( up to a numerical factor ) and the fractional infinitesimal length for a medium with isotropic mass dimension",
    "will be given by @xmath24 where the constant is chosen to derive the standard expression in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "note that the infinitesimal area and volume elements in this `` fractional continuous '' medium of mass dimension @xmath26 will be @xmath27 and hence the mass enclosed in a sphere of radius @xmath3 for constant density @xmath6 will be @xmath28 which will give the standard expression in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "below we consider the mass density and momentum density balance in such a fractal medium of mass dimension @xmath29 in the case of accretion onto a central gravitating mass @xmath13 for the case of our interest ( i.e. the steady state hydrodynamic spherical accretion ) .      in the infinitesimal volume @xmath30 in @xmath31 , the balance of momentum density will imply @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the velocity vector , @xmath36 is the total gravitational force acting on the mass contained in the infinitesimal volume @xmath30 and @xmath37 is the total surface force due to pressure acting on the surfaces bounding the volume @xmath30 and are given by @xmath38 @xmath39\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , for spherical accretion where @xmath40 , it will be reduced to @xmath41 the total change of radial momentum is given by @xmath42dr .",

    "we have solved equations ( [ continuity ] ) and ( [ momentum ] ) for a smooth , monotonic solution without any singularities in the flow . following the standard derivation of the `` bondi solution ''",
    ", we found that there exist unique eigen value solution of the problem for a given @xmath51 and @xmath52 and that the solution must pass through a critical point where @xmath53 the mass accretion rate may not be steady in a small timescale because of the `` clumpy '' structure of the medium but a time average mass accretion rate can also be calculated following the standard derivation and is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are dimensionless parameters @xmath57 @xmath58^{\\frac{\\gamma+1 } { 2(\\gamma-1)}-(3d-1)}. \\label{lambda}\\ ] ] this is consistent with the accretion rate derived from the dimensional analysis ( see eqn.([massdim ] ) in sec.[sec2 ] ) .",
    "the solution also uniquely corresponds to the physically likely situations properly matching the boundary conditions ( small velocity at large distance and high velocity at small @xmath7 in accretion flow and the opposite in `` wind flow '' ) .",
    "the velocity profile is shown in figure ( [ figure2 ] ) for a particular case where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the general nature of the solution is similar to the `` bondi solution '' @xcite .",
    "note that the smooth , physically selected solution exists only for the transonic case with @xmath61 .",
    "it also corresponds to the maximum accretion rate as there exists no meaningful solution either for @xmath62 or for @xmath63 .    note",
    "that value of @xmath64 is of order unity . in particular , for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xcite and for @xmath68 , @xmath64 is given by @xmath69 which is the limit of equation ( [ lambda ] ) as @xmath70 , so that @xmath64 is continuous at @xmath68 .",
    "the most interesting consequence is the dependence of accretion rate on the factor @xmath55 . in the interstellar medium typical ambient sound speed ( which goes as @xmath71 )",
    "is @xmath72 km  s@xmath73 for a temperature of @xmath74 k. in this case the value of @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 this is simply the ratio of the length - scale of `` sphere of influence '' of the accreting object to the scale length of the fractal structure .",
    "as we are mainly interested in the medium inside the sphere of influence , our approach to the problem of accretion in fractal medium will be valid only if @xmath77 .    in such situations",
    ", this factor can change the mass accretion rate substantially and it will crucially depend on the fractional dimensionality @xmath51",
    ". more interestingly , for the cases where this factor is important , the accretion rate @xmath20 will not be proportional to @xmath78 but will be significantly different from that .",
    "for example , for @xmath0 @xcite or equivalently @xmath79 , the accretion rate @xmath80 where @xmath81 .    in the actual astrophysical situation , however , the bondi - hoyle accretion rate will probably be more relevant ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite proposed the interpolation formula ( corrected upto a numerical factor by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) replacing @xmath14 by @xmath82 and bondi radius @xmath83 by bondi - hoyle radius @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the gas velocity relative to the star at a large distance . for a medium with density and velocity structure ,",
    "it is not possible to define a unique @xmath85 and the present analysis can not be extended to such a situation .",
    "but it may be extended to a more idealized case where the medium has a fractal structure and the accretor is moving in a velocity @xmath85 relative to the medium at a large distance . following a similar interpolation method ,",
    "the accretion rate in this case will be @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is a factor of the order of unity .",
    "here we have assumed that the gas velocity relative to the star at a large distance will modify the accretion rate in fractal medium in a similar way that of in the continuous medium .",
    "though a more detailed analysis is required to get the bondi - hoyle accretion rate and , in particular , @xmath89 in turbulent medium , it is most likely that it will not change our main result that the accretion rate will be proportional to @xmath90 .",
    "our results have important implications for a number of astrophysical problems .",
    "one of these , for example , is the problem of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) accretion .",
    "numerical simulation shows that approximating the pms accretion process as bondi - hoyle accretion leads to agreement between simulation and observation @xcite . for a solar mass star and for typical sound speed @xmath91 km",
    "s@xmath73 in ambient molecular cloud filaments @xcite , a fractal scale length of @xmath92 au will be smaller than the size of the sphere of influence and hence our approach should be valid in this particular case .",
    "here we compare our central result with observational data and numerical simulation results .",
    "for that we have taken the accretion rates of pms stars and brown dwarfs compiled by @xcite ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) includes all detections but no upper limit .",
    "though the the data do not provide any strong support for one theory as opposed to another one due to scatter in the accretion rate attributed to ( i ) an age dependence of the accretion rate , ( ii ) variation of @xmath93 , @xmath14 and @xmath85 and ( iii ) interaction of accretion flow with jets and outflows on smaller scale @xcite , we find that our theory is consistent with these data .",
    "for example , the best fit value of @xmath94 is @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "even when we include all the compiled data of @xcite , the best fit value of @xmath94 is consistent with our theory within @xmath97 error for @xmath0 . in figure ( [ figure4 ] ) we have shown the data and the best fit for @xmath98 .",
    "data from @xcite and @xcite are shown as filled squares and empty squares respectively and the rest of the data are shown as empty circles .",
    "we also found that for higher accretion rate and higher central mass , the exponent is significantly different from that of the bondi - hoyle accretion .",
    "for a smaller central mass , the self - gravity that we have neglected in our analysis may change the accretion rate significantly .",
    "it is possible to use a high resolution simulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to find out the fractional dimensionality and the scale length @xmath9 by using equation ( [ md ] ) and counting the number of particle @xmath99 on boxes of different scale length ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "on the other hand , comparing the result with existing numerical simulation results is not very straightforward as in most of the cases it is assumed that @xmath100 and the coefficient @xmath101 is computed for the assumed @xmath78 dependence on accretion rate . but with the existing published simulation results , it is still possible to check if the variation of this coefficient @xmath101 within computational uncertainty can consistently accommodate our result and we found that the best fit of the observational data and our theoretical estimate are within @xmath102 scatter around the computed accretion rate of @xcite . on the other hand , to get a normalized mean accretion rate ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) of @xmath103 for a mach number of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we get , from eqn.([bhaccr ] ) , @xmath106 . for a solar mass star and for a typical sound speed @xmath91 km",
    "s@xmath73 , this translates to @xmath107 au .",
    "fractal structure at this scale is not observationally ruled out .",
    "but one should take this as an order of magnitude estimate of the scale length as factors like velocity structure or magnetic field in real complicated astrophysical situations may alter the accretion rate significantly .",
    "the other potential implication is the black hole accretion .",
    "the model growth of galactic center black holes assume that the black holes accrete at bondi rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if the gas around the black hole is fractal in nature , then one should rather use the modified accretion rate for fractal medium . here",
    "we would like to mention the caveat that there is no definitive observational evidence against or for the fractal nature of the medium in this case .",
    "even if the medium is fractal , the validity of our approach , as mentioned in  3 , crucially depends on the mass of the accretor , the scale length of the fractal and the ambient sound speed .",
    "we have derived the steady state hydrodynamic equations to describe the spherical accretion in a fractal medium by replacing the fractal medium by a `` fractional continuous '' model .",
    "we have derived the steady state accretion rate in terms of boundary conditions at infinity in this simplified situation without considering the self - gravity of the material for a medium where the dimensionality is independent of position and orientation .",
    "magnetic fields , which we have not included in these models , will certainly play a major role in determining the dynamics . but even without the inclusion of magnetic field we have got the following results    we have found that there exists a unique solution with maximum mass accretion rate and the general nature of the solution is similar to the `` bondi solution '' @xcite even for a fractal medium with @xmath4 .",
    "the mass accretion rate , in cases , may differ substantially depending on the fractional dimensionality .",
    "in particular , the accretion rate is likely to be significantly different from the `` bondi accretion rate '' and will be proportional to @xmath108 in case of accretion in fractional medium with scale length @xmath9 very different from @xmath109 .",
    "one limitation of our analysis is that we have not considered the self - gravity of the medium .",
    "this is justified provided the central mass @xmath13 is very large . in cases where self - gravitation is not negligible",
    ", it can change the accretion rate significantly .",
    "a more important limitation is that the present analysis does not account for turbulent velocity structure",
    ". it will certainly play an important role to determine the accretion rate but is probably unlikely to change the mass dependence . in a real astrophysical situation with both density and velocity structure in the medium , the analytical mass accretion rate will hence not be applicable . neglecting the magnetic fields , as mentioned earlier ,",
    "is the other major limitation of the analysis .",
    "the presence of magnetic field is more likely to suppress the accretion rate and magnetohydrodynamic simulation in fractal medium will be required to make a more definitive statement .",
    "but the central result , that the accretion rate will be proportional to @xmath108 will not be affected by the addition of magnetic fields .",
    "our assumption of the equation of state of the form @xmath45 may seems to be a considerable limitation but that is not likely to be the case . in ordinary bondi - hoyle accretion in continuous medium , changing the equation of state changes changes the accretion rate by a numerical factor of the order unity @xcite and hence will not change the result much .",
    "a more detail justification of the assumption can be found in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the accretion rate onto a mass embedded in a fractal medium may differ , in some cases , significantly from the bondi accretion rate even in the simplest situation .",
    "we have used the simple model of accretion onto a mass from a fractal medium of mass dimensionality @xmath110 and derived a self - consistent solution that matches the `` bondi solution '' as @xmath111 .",
    "the primary result of our investigation is that theoretically accretion rate will be proportional to @xmath108 . the observational accretion rate data and the numerical simulation for particular astrophysical problem of accretion onto pms stars is consistent with our result .",
    "our findings suggest that the fractal structure of the medium around the accreting mass is playing a major role to determine the accretion rate and its dependence on the central mass .",
    "the agreement of the theoretical prediction with existing numerical simulation implies the consistency of the approach .",
    "a number of previously published numerical and analytical results have not considered this effect and may need to be reconsidered .",
    "we leave a more detailed treatment of the problem , including the effects discussed in this work , the effect of self - gravity and stability of fractal accretion , to a future work .",
