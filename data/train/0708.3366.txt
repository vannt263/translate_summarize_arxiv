    "do all gas clouds with @xmath0 contain stars ? and",
    "if not , why do some clouds form stars whereas other do not ?",
    "observationally , it is nearly impossible to prove that a gas cloud has no stars at all , because a small number of old stars would generally be far too faint to detect .",
    "while it is difficult to put upper limits on the amount stellar mass , it is relatively easy to obtain interesting upper limits on the amount of star formation .",
    "this can for example be done through the non - detection of recombination lines such as h@xmath1 , which are generated in the  regions around young stars , or through infrared observations .",
    "the  components of most spiral galaxies are observed to extend beyond the region of active star formation .",
    "it has been known for some time , that star formation is generally limited to regions where the total gas surface density exceeds @xmath2 ( e.g. , guiderdoni 1987 ; skillman 1987 , taylor et al .",
    "the existence of a surface density threshold for star formation is , however , usually explained in terms of the toomre criterion for gravitational instability ( e.g. , quirk 1972 ; kennicutt 1989 ) .",
    "neither rotation nor pressure can stabilize a thin , gaseous , differentially rotating disk if the toomre @xmath3 parameter , @xmath4 is less than unity ( safronov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ) ; where the effective sound speed @xmath5 , the epicycle frequency @xmath6 , and the gas surface density @xmath7 all depend on radius @xmath8 . according to this theory , star formation is suppressed when the gas surface density falls below the critical value @xmath9 which depends on the local values of the velocity dispersion and the epicycle frequency .",
    "kennicutt ( 1989 ) and martin & kennicutt ( 2001 , hereafter mk01 ) tested the hypothesis that the toomre criterion is responsible for the observed cutoff in the star formation rate by measuring the ratio @xmath10 of the gas surface density @xmath7 to the critical surface density . assuming a constant velocity dispersion of @xmath11 and after azimuthal averaging ,",
    "mk01 found that @xmath12 , see schaye ( 2004 ) .",
    "] at the truncation radius in a sample of 32 nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "elmegreen & parravano ( 1994 ) emphasized that the need for a cold gas phase imposes a pressure threshold .",
    "schaye ( 2004 , hereafter s04 ) showed that the transition from the warm to the cold gas phase triggers gravitational instability on a wide range of scales .",
    "he demonstrated that this thermo - gravitational instability can account for the observed star formation threshold , which he predicted to fall in the range @xmath13@xmath14 ( corresponding to a critical pressure @xmath15@xmath16 and a critical volume density @xmath17@xmath18 ) , with weak dependencies on the metallicity , uv radiation field , turbulent pressure , and the mass fraction in gas .",
    "after briefly summarizing the s04 model in section [ sec : s04model ] , i argue in section [ sec : toomreassumptions ] that the toomre @xmath3 hypothesis relies on assumptions that break down in the outer parts of galaxies , where star formation thresholds are observed . in section [ sec : obs ]",
    "i discuss a number of observational findings that are naturally explained by the thermo - gravitational instability hypothesis .    in the second part of my talk",
    ", i discussed the relation between star formation laws expressed in terms of surface densities , volume densities and pressures .",
    "i presented a method based on this theory with which it is possible to reproduce arbitrary kennicutt - schmidt laws using numerical simulations , without any free parameters .",
    "i do not have the space here to describe this model and its implications for the interpretation of simulations . for more on this topic ,",
    "stay tuned for the paper `` on the relation between the schmidt and kennicutt - schmidt star formation laws and its implication for numerical simulations '' ( schaye & dalla vecchia , in preparation ) .",
    "the insterstellar medium of galaxies is highly complex . it contains a number of gas phases , including a cold ( @xmath19 ) , warm ( @xmath20 ) , and hot ( @xmath21 ) phase .",
    "feedback from star formation drives strong , supersonic turbulence which can both promote and suppress gravitational stability . because of this complexity",
    ", it is difficult to predict exactly where and when star formation occurs .",
    "however , the outer parts of galaxies are much simpler . here",
    "the gas is almost exclusively warm and there is no , or very little , star formation and hence turbulence is weak and typically subsonic . moving in towards the center",
    ", we may therefore be able to predict where star formation begins , even if we can not predict what happens further in .",
    "s04 noted that the uv background radiation implies the existence of a threshold surface density for the formation of a cold phase , which agrees with the empirically determined star formation threshold .",
    "he hypothesized that the drop in the pressure associated with the transition to a cold phase triggers gravitational instability and thus star formation .",
    "conversely , for densities below the threshold , self - gravitating gas clouds are kept warm and stable by the uv radiation .    to test this hypothesis ,",
    "s04 constructed two model galaxies consisting of exponential discs embedded in cold dark matter halos .",
    "the discs were illuminated by uv radiation and contained metals and dust . for a fixed surface density ,",
    "the temperature and volume density were determined numerically under the condition of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium . the radiative transfer and chemistry",
    "were calculated using the publicly available package cloudy ( ferland 2000 ) .",
    "the parameters of the model galaxies were chosen to mimic a high and a low surface brightness galaxy .",
    "figure  [ fig : rotcurves ] shows the rotation curves ( solid ) , including the contributions of the halo ( short dashed ) and disc ( long dashed ) , the epicycle frequency ( dot - dashed ) and @xmath22 times oort s constant ( dotted ) .",
    "the solid curves in figure  [ fig : threshold ] show the toomre @xmath3 parameter as a function of radius .",
    "the sudden drop in the @xmath3 values coincides with ( and is caused by ) a similar drop in the temperature ( dashed curves ) , and a sharp increase in the molecular fraction ( dot - dashed curves ) .",
    "the transition to the cold phase , which coincides with the onset of gravitational instability ( @xmath23 ) , occurs at a fixed surface density .",
    "note that the models become unrealistic shortwards of the critical radius , where feedback from star formation will increase the uv field , the metallicity , and the turbulent pressure .",
    "figure  [ fig : qcomparison ] again shows the @xmath3 parameter ( thick solid curves ) as a function of radius , but note that this time the @xmath24-axis is logarithmic . the value @xmath25 is indicated with solid , horizontal lines .",
    "a toomre @xmath3 of unity implies marginal instability only for fluctuations with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 in general , instability of perturbations on scale @xmath28 requires @xmath29 , where @xmath30 the dot - dashed curves in figure  [ fig : qcomparison ] indicate the @xmath3 values below which the disc is unstable to perturbations with wavelengths of ( top ) @xmath31 , ( middle ) @xmath32 , and ( bottom ) 10  pc .",
    "the transition to the cold phase causes @xmath3 to drop far below unity , thereby triggering instability on a wide range of scales .    assuming a constant velocity dispersion of @xmath33 ( thick dashed curves )",
    "would result in large errors in the @xmath3-parameter .",
    "however , if we recalibrate the critical @xmath3 parameter and compare with the value measured by kennicutt ( 1989 ) ( horizontal dashed lines ) , then we obtain agreement between the predicted critical radii ( the intersections of the thick solid curves and the horizontal solid lines roughly coincide with the intersections of the thick dashed curves and the horizontal dashed lines ) .",
    "s04 computed a large range of models and found that the following function can describe the variation of the critical surface density with the parameters of the model @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the metallicity , @xmath36 is the flux of ionizing radiation , and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the mass fraction in gas and @xmath39 the fraction of the pressure that is thermal .",
    "the above formula ( see s04 for second order corrections ) was found to reproduce the results for a wide variety of galaxy models .",
    "in this section i will argue that the toomre analysis is generally not applicable to star formation thresholds in the outer parts of disc galaxies , because the underlying assumptions are invalid .",
    "below i will discuss the offending assumptions in turn .",
    "a toomre @xmath3 smaller than unity is sufficient for star formation : :     a toomre @xmath3 of unity implies marginal instability only    for fluctuations with @xmath40 . in the outer parts of disc galaxies ,",
    "this critical    wavelength is typically @xmath41 ( see    fig .  [",
    "fig : qcomparison ] ) .",
    "hence , while @xmath25 is relevant    for large - scale modes such as spiral arms , we require fluctuations    with much smaller wavelengths to become unstable to account for the    formation of star clusters . note that if    @xmath42    is observed , then the condition @xmath43 implies    @xmath44 and thus    @xmath45 .",
    "the disc is thin : :     in the outer parts of galaxies , the disc scale height is similar to    the most unstable wavelength , thereby invalidating the assumption that    the disc is thin .",
    "the perturbations are axisymmetric : :     beyond the truncation radius identified in azimuthally averaged    observations , star formation does occur in isolated regions whenever    the local gas surface density exceeds the global threshold ( e.g. ,    ferguson et al .",
    "the toomre analysis is valid only for    axisymmetric perturbations and can therefore not straightforwardly be    applied to such regions .",
    "the velocity dispersion is constant : :     although the toomre analysis does not require it , when it is applied    to star formation thresholds it is generally assumed that the velocity    dispersion is constant .",
    "following kennicutt ( 1989 ) , most work assumes    @xmath46 . for sufficiently large scale heights",
    ",    the gas will be kept warm by the uv background radiation .",
    "therefore ,    there will always be a component with a velocity dispersion of at    least that of the warm phase .",
    "however , if there is any cold gas then    the relevant velocity dispersion , and thus @xmath3 , can    locally be much smaller .",
    "rotation needs to be taken into account : :     as mentioned above , to form stars , or even star clusters , we require    instability for @xmath47 and hence @xmath43 .",
    "however , for    @xmath47 the toomre criterion reduces to the two - dimensional jeans    criterion : @xmath48 .    hence , rotation is generally not directly relevant for star formation    thresholds .",
    "+    the exception is the central part of the disc , where    @xmath49 becomes small    ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rotcurves ] ) and the coriolis force can , in principle ,    prevent collapse on scales relevant for star formation .",
    "however , in    practice the disc can not be considered thin in the central parts    because the scale height is no longer small compared with the radius .",
    "moreover , the bulge will need to be taken into account .",
    "a number of observational findings , some of which were thought to be unrelated , can be explained by the thermo - gravitational instability theory of star formation thresholds . below",
    "i will discuss the most important ones .",
    "why can a single constant , surface density threshold account for the observed star formation thresholds ( e.g. , guiderdoni 1987 ; skillman 1987 , taylor et al .",
    "1994 ) ? a constant",
    "threshold works works even on a pixel - by - pixel basis for high - resolution observations of nearby galaxies ( de blok & walter 2006 ) and it can also account for the isolated star formation events beyond the optical radii of galaxies ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "if the toomre hypothesis holds , then @xmath50 and should therefore vary from place to place .",
    "even if we fix @xmath5 , as is often done , it should still depend on the epicycle frequency",
    ". if the thermo - gravitational instability is responsible , then the critical surface density will be nearly constant [ see equation ( [ eq : sigmac_s04 ] ) ] and the predicted value is in excellent agreement with the observations .",
    "note that although @xmath51 is predicted to depend only very weakly on environmental factors such as the metallicity and the uv intensity , the differences may still become noticeable in extreme environments .",
    "for example , we predict @xmath52 for the first generation of stars at very high redshift ( because @xmath53 ) and also very near strong sources of uv radiation .",
    "why does a constant threshold work even when the toomre criterion does not ?",
    "many studies have found so - called `` subcritical discs '' .",
    "that is , galaxies for which @xmath54 exceeds the critical value throughout the region of active star formation ( e.g. , mk01 ; wong & blitz 2002 ; auld et al .",
    "2006 ) . about 1 in 4 of the galaxies from the sample of mk01 fall in this category . as can be seen from the figures in these papers , the subcritical discs do agree with the constant star formation threshold hypothesis .",
    "why is the velocity dispersion of the outer  disk constant and why does it have the value @xmath55 ( e.g. , lo et al .  1993 ; meurer et al.1996 ) ? neither magnetically induced ( sellwood & balbus 1999 ) nor gravitationally induced ( e.g. , wada et al .",
    "2002 ) turbulence can account for such a high ( and constant ) value .",
    "according to the thermo - gravitational instability picture , the gas in the outer disk , at surface densities below the threshold , is kept warm by the uv background radiation .",
    "although this should be uncontroversial , theoretical studies have rarely taken radiation into account .",
    "maybhate et al .  (",
    "2007 ) found that the standard , constant surface density threshold can also account for observations of star clusters in tidal arms .",
    "tidal arms can hardly be considered part of thin , differentially rotating discs , and the toomre hypothesis is therefore even less applicable to these observations than to those in the outer parts of disc galaxies .",
    "however , the thermo - gravitational instability does not assume a thin , rotating disc and should thus hold equally well in tidal arms .",
    "why does the contribution of the cold interstellar phase to the gas surface density become negligible beyond the edge of the star forming disk ( braun 1997 ) ?",
    "this observation is in excellent agreement with the predictions of the thermo - gravitational instability hypothesis : the formation of a cold phase triggers star formation and the two therefore go hand in hand .",
    "for @xmath57 the cold gas fraction , and thus the star formation rate , plummets .    in the constant velocity dispersion version of the toomre hypothesis there is no 1 - 1 relationship between the ability to form a cold phase and the ability to form stars . while instability of the warm phase will presumably also eventually trigger the formation of a cold phase",
    ", the converse does not need to be true .",
    "therefore , there is no reason why there could not be lots of cold gas in regions where there is no star formation .",
    "many observations indicate that while the surface density increases with decreasing galactocentric radius , it typically saturates around @xmath14 ( e.g. , wong & blitz 2002 ) . at smaller",
    "radii the total gas surface density can be much higher , but for @xmath59 most of the gas is molecular .",
    "is it a coincidence that the  surface density saturates at the star formation threshold ?",
    "if the toomre hypothesis is correct , then it would be .",
    "although star formation may destroy the , there will be galaxies for which the disc is toomre stable for @xmath59 .    in schaye ( 2001 )",
    "i pointed out that there is a physical upper limit to the  surface density of gas clouds because the gas will quickly go molecular beyond a critical density , which depends weakly on the metallicity and the uv radiation field .",
    "the transition to a cold , molecular phase both limits the  surface density and triggers star formation .",
    "thus , the agreement between the critical surface density for star formation and the  saturation limit is a prediction of the thermo - gravitational instability picture .",
    "it has been argued that mk01 s finding that the molecular fraction varies wildly at the critical radius for star formation is evidence against the thermo - gravitational hypothesis .",
    "however , a large scatter in the molecular fraction is exactly what is expected here .",
    "the critical radius @xmath60 is defined ( by eye ) as the radius within which star formation is ubiquitous and beyond which it is sporadic .",
    "the prediction is that for @xmath61 the gas is mostly atomic , while for @xmath62 it is mostly molecular ( provided that @xmath63 is well behaved so that @xmath64 for @xmath61 and @xmath65 for @xmath62 ) . since @xmath66 is the transition regime , we expect both atomic and molecular regions .",
    "azimuthal averaging will then result in a wide range of molecular fractions .",
    "mk01 find that star formation is suppressed when @xmath67 .",
    "on the other hand , hunter , elmegreen , & baker ( 1998 ) measured a smaller value of @xmath1 for a sample of irregulars .",
    "however , hunter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used a velocity dispersion of @xmath68 because the standard value of @xmath11 was inconsistent with the observations .",
    "had they assumed used @xmath11 , they would have inferred a value of @xmath1 that agrees within @xmath69 with the kennicutt ( 1989 ) value .",
    "this again reflects the fact that a constant surface density threshold describes the observations very well .",
    "if @xmath70 is increased , then a constant surface density threshold implies a corresponding reduction of @xmath1 .",
    "s04 argued that star formation thresholds are set by the necessity to form a cold gas phase . below a critical surface density",
    "the gas is kept warm by uv radiation .",
    "conversely , when the surface density exceeds the threshold , the drop in the gas pressure associated with the phase transition triggers gravitational instability . as we discussed above",
    ", this hypothesis is in excellent , quantitative agreement with observations of the outer parts of galaxies .",
    "it can account for the observed star formation thresholds and the observed velocity dispersion , it can explain the lack of cold gas beyond regions of active star formation , and it also explains the coincidence between the critical surface density and the  saturation limit .    does the toomre @xmath3 play any role at all ?",
    "it almost certainly does play an important role .",
    "although it is not applicable to the outer parts , the molecular disc is thin compared with @xmath71 and can thus be characterized using the toomre parameter . if @xmath23 then the disc is unstable to large - scale axisymmetric perturbations , which will for example lead to the formation of spiral arms .",
    "the resulting increase in the surface density can trigger local instabilities , and not necessarily only through the formation of a cold phase .",
    "however , on scales relevant to the formation of star clusters , the 3-d jeans criterion describes the local stability better than the local toomre @xmath3 , and much better than the constant velocity dispersion version of the toomre criterion ."
