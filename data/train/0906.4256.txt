    "study of superconductor / normal metal ( s / n ) or superconductor / superconductor hetero - structures has been a popular topic during last decades lambraim , been , nazrev , zaikinrev .",
    "both the equilibrium and non - equilibrium properties of such systems were under intensive investigation .",
    "non - equilibrium phenomena are of special interest because they are essentially different from the equilibrium ones but several interesting effects have been observed even in the cases when a deviation from the equilibrium is small . as an example , one can mention a non - monotonic behavior of the resistance of s / n structures as a function of temperature @xmath1 or applied voltage @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "if the applied voltage is not too small , the superconductor s ( for example , in a n / s / n system ) goes out of the equilibrium and new phenomena come into play .",
    "study of non - equilibrium effects in superconducting hetero - structures as well as in homogeneous superconductors in the presence of optical or microwaves radiations has been carried out during a long time ( see reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , eliashberg suggested to stimulate superconductivity by a microwave radiation that leads to an essential deviation of the distribution function @xmath6 from the equilibrium one @xcite .",
    "as the energy gap @xmath7 in s is related to the function @xmath6 via the self - consistancy equation , the energy gap and the critical temperature may increase in the presence of  a microwave radiation , which results in an increase of the critical current @xcite . another interesting effect caused by a non - equilibrium distribution function",
    "is the sign reversal of the josephson critical current @xmath8 in a multi - terminal sns junction @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , provided the distribution function in the normal metal n controlled by additional n electrodes differs significantly from the equilibrium one , the critical current @xmath8 becomes negative ( @xmath9-state ) volkovprl , schonprl , yip .    in recent years ,",
    "the interest in studies of non - equilibrium effects in s / n or s / s hetero - structures has revived .",
    "this is due to the progress in nanotechnology , the possible applications of such structures in low - temperature devices @xcite and to the progress in theoretical research @xcite .    perhaps , the simplest system in which one can study non - equilibrium effects is a n / s / n structure with a bias current @xmath10 .",
    "such a structure was studied theoretically in recent papers @xcite . in ref.keizer",
    "it was assumed that the resistance of the s / n interfaces is negligible .",
    "the calculated i - v characteristics ( cvc ) was shown to be of the so - called n - shape type , that is , three values of voltages correspond to one value of the bias current @xmath10 .",
    "earlier this type of the i - v characteristics was studied in other superconducting systems tinkham , vkjetp , mints , vodolazov .    the opposite case of a large s / n interface resistance was considered in ref.@xcite . in this case",
    "the i - v curve is of the s - type , i.e. three values of the current correspond to one value of the voltage @xmath5 between the n leads .",
    "such kind of the cvc was known from previous studies of the superconducting structures .",
    "for example , it can be realized in s / i / s junctions @xcite and in granular superconductors @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite investigated the stability of this system and came to the conclusion that the system is stable .",
    "however , this conclusion is valid only in the case of small lateral dimensions of the structure . from a general theory of the system with negative differential conductance ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "it is known that the states with negative @xmath12 are unstable and in case of the s - shape i - v curve a stratification of the current density occurs as a result of the instability @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous states in different superconducting systems were studied in approximate models with account for electron - electron or electron - phonon inelastic scattering elesin , schonrev .    in the present paper , we analyze the n / s / n structure of the type considered in ref.@xcite assuming however that lateral dimensions are large .",
    "the latter assumption turns out to be very important .",
    "we find in this limit that a new inhomogeneous state is possible , which contrasts the situation in small sized systems .",
    "physics of this inhomogeneous state is very similar to that of the inhomogeneous state in equilibrium superconductors with an exchange field ( the larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferell states @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing though that , in the system considered here , there are no magnetic interactions and their role is played by a finite voltage @xmath5 ( see below).under certain assumptions we calculate the i - v curve and study possible inhomogeneous states .",
    "most of the results are obtained in an analytical form . in particular",
    ", we find the spatial distribution of the current density @xmath13 and energy gap @xmath14 and draw an analogy with those in the loff states .",
    "in order to calculate physical quantities we use a kinetic equation for the non - equilibrium distribution functions @xmath15 .",
    "the procedure of the derivation is quite standard ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and is based on using quasi - classical keldysh matrix green functions @xmath16 .",
    "they are expressed in terms of the two distribution functions @xmath15 as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 pauli matrix and @xmath20 is the unit matrix .",
    "the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 introduced by schmid and schn @xcite .",
    "the considered n / s / n system is shown in fig.1a .",
    "we assume that the tunnelling probability through the interface is small and that the retarded ( advanced ) green s functions @xmath25 have the same form as in a bulk superconductor : @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the only difference is that , in contrast to the bulk case , the damping @xmath29 caused by a weak proximity effect , enters the formula for the function @xmath30 . in this limit",
    "the damping @xmath29 is equal to @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath34 is the sn interface resistance per unit area , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the conductivity ( in the normal state ) and the thickness of the superconductor .",
    "the thickness of the s layer is assumed to be small ( @xmath37 ) , so that all quantities do not depend on the @xmath38coordinate .",
    "the opposite case was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . the thickness of the n leads is supposed to be large ( @xmath39 ) so that the n metals are in the equilibrium state .",
    "the function @xmath40 appears due to a branch imbalance and , being dependent on the electric potential @xmath5 , determines the current @xmath0 . in case of a fully symmetric n / s / n system @xmath41 .",
    "the function @xmath42 determines the energy gap @xmath43 .",
    "since the function @xmath42 depends on the applied voltage @xmath44 the gap @xmath7 is also a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the dependence @xmath45 is given by the self - consistency equation    @xmath46    where @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the coupling constant and debye energy , respectively .",
    "( [ sceq ] ) is a generalization of the conventional bcs equation to the non - equilibrium case .",
    "the functions @xmath15 can be found from the kinetic equation that can be written in s in the form ( see for example @xcite )    @xmath50    where @xmath51is the normalized density - of - states ( dos ) , @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the resistance of the left ( right ) s / n interfaces , and @xmath54 is an energy - dependent diffusion coefficient , @xmath55   \\label{a1}\\]]with @xmath56 .",
    "the functions @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ kineticeq ] ) are defined as : @xmath58   \\label{a2}\\ ] ]    the distribution functions in the normal metals are assumed to have the equilibrium forms shifted by the applied voltages @xmath5 . in a fully symmetric system , the voltages in the right ( @xmath59 ) and left ( @xmath60 ) n metals are equal to @xmath61 . in this situation , the functions @xmath62 entering eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) take the simple form @xmath63where @xmath64  is the reservoir temperature . in the limit of the weak coupling between n and s layers the density - of - states in the n metals",
    "is supposed to be unperturbed by the proximity effect : @xmath65    the first terms in the r.h.s . of the kinetic equation ( [ kineticeq ] )",
    "describe the tunneling of quasiparticles from ( to ) the normal electrodes , whereas the last one is an inelastic collision term .",
    "it consists of the electron - electron and electron - phonon collision terms ( @xmath66 ) and is of the order of @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the electron - electron and electron - phonon inelastic scattering times .",
    "eq.([kineticeq ] ) contains the dos , @xmath70 , depending on the energy gap @xmath71 therefore eqs.([sceq]-[a3 ] ) are coupled , and the problem of finding the distribution function @xmath21 is not easy .",
    "we consider first a homogeneous stationary state assuming that all the quantities do not depend on the coordinate @xmath72 .",
    "however , the problem of solving eqs.([sceq]-[a3 ] ) is too complicated even under this assumption and therefore we consider only two limiting cases .",
    "first , we analyse the limit of a very weak electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions :    @xmath73 , when the collision terms in eq .",
    "( [ kineticeq ] ) can be neglected . in other words ,",
    "the s / n interface resistance @xmath34 is not too high : @xmath74 . this approximation has been used in many papers ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . for a symmetric n / s / n system we use eq . ( [ a3 ] ) and obtain from eq.([kineticeq ] ) the following solutions @xmath75substituting the function @xmath21 into eq.([sceq ] ) and shifting the energy in the integral by @xmath76 in the first term and by @xmath77 in the second one , we reduce eq .",
    "( [ sceq ] ) to the following form    @xmath78    remarkably , the form of eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) is the same as the one for a superconductor in the presence of an exchange field . in other words ,",
    "the problem of the non - equilibrium superconductor in the n / s / n system is to a great extent equivalent to the problem of the equilibrium superconductor with the distribution function @xmath79 in the presence of an `` exchange ''  field @xmath76 .",
    "the latter problem has been attracting a lot of attention since the pioneering works by larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite and by fulde and ferrell @xcite . for the model with the exchange field , these authors have predicted a new state called now loff state .",
    "they considered a clean superconductor with the exchange field @xmath80 ( or a strong magnetic field ) acting on spins of electrons .",
    "they demonstrated that at zero temperature the energy gap @xmath7 remained unchanged unless the exchange energy @xmath80 exceeded the value @xmath81 , where @xmath81 is the energy gap at zero temperature in the absence of @xmath80 .",
    "however , in addition to this solution of the self - consistency equation , there is another , unstable , solution for @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 therefore , in the interval @xmath85 there are three possible solutions for @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath81 ( the trivial solution @xmath88 always exists ) .",
    "the situation resembles the behavior of a non - ideal gas described by the van der waals equation of state , and thus , one can expect a stratification of the electron system . indeed , as it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , an inhomogeneous state with the energy gap @xmath89 varying in space turns out to be more favorable than the homogeneous one .    using",
    "the equivalence between the n / s / n system at a finite voltage @xmath5 and the equilibrium superconductor in the presence of the exchange field one may expect an inhomogeneous loff - like state in the system considered here .",
    "a multi - valued ( in a certain region of parameters ) dependence of the energy gap @xmath7 on the applied voltage @xmath5 and damping @xmath29 has recently been found for an n / s / n system in ref .",
    "the function @xmath90 had a form similar to that determined by eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "it was established that at some values of the parameters the cvc had the so - called s - shaped form .",
    "this type of the cvc is well known in bulk superconductors and has already been obtained both theoretically ( see the review elesin , schonrev ) and experimentally @xcite several decades ago .",
    "although , one could expect an inhomogeneous state in the n / s / n systems , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite came to the conclusion that the homogeneous state had to remain stable .",
    "this statement is correct for the superconductor island of a small size considered in ref . @xcite but can not remain valid for large superconducting films sandwiched between normal metals . note also that the authors of ref.@xcite studied the stability of the system in a short time interval : @xmath91 ( a similar dynamic behavior of the order parameter in a collisionless superconducting system was studied earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand the instability develops on much longer characteristic times @xmath92    in this case ,",
    "the states corresponding to the part of the cvc with negative differential resistance are unstable and the stratification of the current density occurs in the system ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "this structure resembles the loff coordinate dependence of the order parameter and of other physical quantities .",
    "however , in contrast to the loff state in the equilibrium superconductors with the exchange field , the coordinate dependence can not be found minimizing the free energy because we consider a system out of the equilibrium .     for @xmath93 and different temperatures @xmath94 ( shown in the inset),width=226,height=340 ]",
    "although the similarity between the problem involved and the problem of loff is most clearly seen in the limit , @xmath95 , one has to solve in this limit complicated integro - differential equations ( [ sceq],[kineticeq ] ) and this can be done only numerically .",
    "the problem can be solved analytically in another limit :    @xmath96    in this limit the electron - phonon interaction is very weak and the electron - phonon collision term in eq .",
    "( [ kineticeq ] ) can be neglected .",
    "the largest term in eq . ( [ kineticeq ] ) is the electron - electron collision term @xmath97    note that the electron - electron @xmath98  and electron - phonon @xmath99  scattering rates depend on energy @xmath100 langenberg so that eq.([efftcond ] )  can be satisfied not at all energies . if the mean free path is not too short ( @xmath101 but @xmath102 because we consider the dirty limit ) , these scattering rates are : @xmath103  and @xmath104  with @xmath105  and @xmath106  where @xmath107  are electron - electron ( electron - phonon ) interaction constants , @xmath108  is the fermi energy , @xmath109  is the sound velocity ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic energy @xmath110 in our case is of the order @xmath111  thus , for the al s - films the inelastic scattering rates are : @xmath112  and @xmath113 @xcite.at temperatures lower than @xmath114 ,  the interval between @xmath98  and @xmath115  becomes larger because @xmath115  has a stronger dependence on @xmath100  than @xmath116  however , one has to take into account the dependence of @xmath98 and @xmath117 on @xmath118 therefore , if the frequency @xmath119 which is determined by the s / n interface resistance @xmath120  is chosen in the interval @xmath121 @xmath122",
    "@xmath123 , the approximation of an effective temperature can be applied to the case of these films .",
    "it is worth noting that the violation of the condition ( [ efftcond ] ) leads only to breakdown of the effective temperature approximation , but not to disappearance of the effects under consideration . for these effects",
    "it is important only to have the s - shape cvc , which is realized , for example , also in the case of the frequency @xmath124  large in comparison with @xmath98  and @xmath115  ( see the preceding section and @xcite ) .",
    "however the approximation of the effective temperature allows one to solve the problem in an analytical form . in the limit of high impurity concentration ( @xmath125 )",

    "however , one can show that in this case the cvc of the system also has the s - shape form and all the effects considered here remain qualitatively unchanged , although the analytical approach is not possible in this case .    in the limit determined by eq .",

    "the distribution function @xmath21 in these systems has the same form as in n / s / n systems .",
    "therefore , by measuring the spatial distribution @xmath14 , one can get information about the inhomogeneous states in the n / s systems .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ideas that the symmetry breaking of the loff type may occur not only in the superconductors but also in the quantum chromo - dynamics , astrophysics and in cold gases ( see the review nardulli and references therein ) have been put forward recently .",

    "so , the investigation of non - equilibrium superconductors , for example superconductors in tunnel n / s / n systems , can provide one more possibility to observe the loff state experimentally .",
