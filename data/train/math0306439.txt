    "many interesting examples of cyclic branched coverings of knots in @xmath3 admitting cyclic presentations for the fundamental groups have recently been found ( see @xcite ) . in order to investigate these relations , m. j. dunwoody introduced in @xcite a class of 3-manifolds , depending on six integer parameters , with cyclically presented fundamental groups .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that all these manifolds turn out to be strongly - cyclic branched coverings of @xmath4-knots in lens spaces ( possibly @xmath3 ) . moreover , the explicit dunwoody representation for all cyclic branched coverings of 2-bridge knots has been obtained .    in this paper",
    "we give a similar result for a wide class of torus knots , which are , together with 2-bridge knots , the most important examples of @xmath4-knots in @xmath3 .",
    "the dunwoody parameters are obtained for all cyclic branched coverings of torus knots of type @xmath5 , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , thus including all torus knots with bridge number @xmath6 .",
    "these manifolds have been considered , from a different point of view , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details on knot theory and cyclic branched coverings of knots and to @xcite for details on cyclic presentation of groups .",

    "it is well known that the family of @xmath4-knots contains all torus knots and all two - bridge knots in @xmath3 .",
    "several topological properties of @xmath4-knots have recently been investigated ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "an algebraic representation of @xmath4-knots has been developed in @xcite and @xcite , where it is shown that there is a natural surjective map @xmath17 from the pure mapping class group of the twice punctured torus @xmath18 to the class @xmath19 of all @xmath4-knots .",
    "the fundamental group of the exterior of a @xmath4-knot @xmath20 can be explicitly obtained using its representation @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the loops depicted in figure [ fig . 0 ] .",
    "they represent a set of free generators for @xmath23 , while @xmath24 and @xmath25 freely generate @xmath26 .",
    "a straightforward application of seifert - van kampen theorem gives :    [ fundamental1 ] the fundamental group of the exterior of a @xmath4-knot @xmath27 admits the presentation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the homotopy class of @xmath30 , being @xmath31 the inclusion map .        as a consequence ,",
    "all @xmath4-knots in @xmath3 are prime @xcite , and can therefore be classified , up to mirror image , by their fundamental groups ( see @xcite ) .",
    "many results concerning the connections between cyclically presented groups and strongly - cyclic branched coverings of @xmath4-knots ( see definition in @xcite ) have been obtained .",
    "it has been proved in @xcite that every @xmath32-fold strongly - cyclic branched covering of a @xmath4-knot admits a heegaard diagram of genus @xmath32 which encodes a cyclic presentation for the fundamental group .",
    "this result has been improved in @xcite , where a constructive algorithm which explicitly gives the cyclic presentations is obtained .        the family of dunwoody manifolds has been introduced in @xcite by a class of trivalent regular planar graphs ( called _ dunwoody diagrams _ ) with cyclic symmetry , depending on six integers @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for certain values of the parameters , called _",
    "admissible _ , the dunwoody diagrams @xmath37 turn out to be heegaard diagrams , so defining a wide class of closed , orientable 3-manifolds @xmath38 with cyclically presented fundamental groups .",
    "more precisely , an admissible dunwoody diagram @xmath37 is an open heegaard diagram of genus @xmath32 ( see figure [ fig . 13 ] ) , which contains @xmath32 upper cycles @xmath39 , and @xmath32 lower cycles @xmath40 , each having @xmath41 vertices . for every @xmath42 , the cycle @xmath43 ( resp .",
    "@xmath44 ) is connected to the cycle @xmath45 ( resp .",
    "@xmath46 ) by @xmath47 parallel arcs , to the cycle @xmath48 by @xmath49 parallel arcs and to the cycle @xmath46 by @xmath50 parallel arcs .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 the set of all these arcs .",
    "the cycle @xmath43 is glued to the cycle @xmath52 ( subscripts mod @xmath32 ) so that equally labelled vertices are identified together .",
    "observe that the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be considered mod @xmath55 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "since the identification rule and the diagram are invariant with respect to a cyclic action of order @xmath32 , the dunwoody manifolds admit a cyclic symmetry of order @xmath32 . obviously , the dunwoody manifold @xmath56 is homeomorphic to a lens space ( possibly @xmath3 ) , since it admits a heegaard splitting of genus one .",
    "a characterization of all dunwoody manifolds as strongly - cyclic branched coverings of @xmath4-knots is given by the following :    [ strongly - cyclic ] the dunwoody manifold @xmath38 is the @xmath32-fold strongly - cyclic covering of the lens space @xmath56 ( possibly @xmath3 ) , branched over a @xmath4-knot @xmath57 only depending on the integers @xmath58 .",
    "the converse of this result is also true , as proved in @xcite .",
    "so the class of the dunwoody manifolds coincides with the class of the strongly - cyclic branched coverings of @xmath4-knots .",
    "the @xmath4-knots @xmath57 occurring in proposition [ strongly - cyclic ] admit a natural @xmath4-decomposition @xmath59 depicted in figure [ fig . 4 ] , where the arcs of @xmath51 constitute the curve @xmath60 , @xmath21 being the element of @xmath18 correspondent to @xmath61 .",
    "the fundamental group of the exterior of @xmath57 can be directly read in the dunwoody diagram of @xmath62 .",
    "the relation @xmath29 of the presentation of lemma [ fundamental1 ] is obtained by walking along the arcs of @xmath51 , following a fixed orientation : associate to each arc a word in @xmath24 and @xmath25 representing its homotopy class in the fundamental group of @xmath63 ( see figure [ fig .",
    "4 ] ) , where a properly embedded disk with boundary @xmath64 is considered squeezed to the base point @xmath65 .    ]",
    "an interesting problem is to find the dunwoody parameters of the cyclic branched coverings of important classes of @xmath4-knots , in particular when the knot lies in @xmath3 .",
    "this type of result has been obtained in ( * ? ? ?",

    "starting from the vertex of @xmath70 with label @xmath55 , we pass along all the arcs of @xmath51 with the described orientation , obtaining the word @xmath71 . therefore , since the conditions of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4 ) are satisfied , @xmath72 is admissible .",
    "moreover , the fundamental group of @xmath73 is @xmath74 , which is trivial .",

    "moreover , @xmath76 . since @xmath77",
    ", we have @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",

    "so @xmath72 is admissible .",
    "moreover , @xmath86 is homeomorphic to @xmath3 , since its fundamental group is trivial . since @xmath87 , the group @xmath88 is isomorphic to the group @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , @xmath7 is the torus knot @xmath90 .        from proposition",
    "[ strongly - cyclic ] , we only need to find the sixth parameter @xmath54 of the 6-tuples .",
    "the relation @xmath91 mod @xmath32 must be satisfied for all @xmath32 , where @xmath92 is the number of arcs of @xmath51 oriented from @xmath93 to @xmath70 minus the number of the ones oriented from the @xmath70 to @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the number of arcs of @xmath51 oriented from the right to the left minus the number of the ones oriented from the left to the right in the dunwoody diagram ( see @xcite ) .",

    "an extension of the previous results to the whole class of torus knots by using the same proof technique seems to be very complicated , although some partial results have been obtained",
