    "in constraint satisfaction problems we ask for the probability that a random expression , built on a finite set of boolean variables according to some rules ( @xmath1-sat , @xmath1-xor - sat , nae ,  ) , is ( un)satisfiable . the behaviour of this probability , when the number @xmath2 of boolean variables and the length @xmath3 of the expression ( usually defined as the number of clauses ) tend to infinity , has given rise to numerous studies , most of them concentrating on the existence and location of a threshold from satisfiability to unsatisfiability as the ratio @xmath4 grows .",
    "the literature in this direction is vast ; for xor - functions see e.g. @xcite .    defining a probability distribution on boolean functions through a distribution on boolean expressions",
    "is _ a priori _ a different question .",
    "quantitative logic aims at answering such a question , and many results have been obtained when the boolean expression , or equivalently the random tree that models it , is a variation of well - known combinatorial or probabilistic tree models such as galton - watson and plya trees , binary search trees , etc ( @xcite ) .",
    "so we have two frameworks : on the one hand we try to determine the probability that an expression is satisfiable ; on the other hand we try to identify probability distributions on the set of boolean functions .",
    "it is only natural that we should wish to merge these two approaches : we set satisfiability problems into the framework of quantitative logic ( this only requires choosing a suitable model of expressions ) and ask for the probability of @xmath5  this is the classical satisfiability problem  _ and _ for the probabilities of the other boolean functions as well .",
    "this amounts to refining the satisfiable case and taking all the functions different from @xmath5 also into account .",
    "the set of boolean expressions is then partitioned into subsets according to the ( class of ) boolean function(s ) that is computed .    within this unified framework one could , e.g. , ask for the probability that a random expression computes a function that is satisfied by a specific number of assigments .",
    "although this may turn out to be out of our reach for most classical satisfiability problems , there are some problems for which we may still hope to obtain a ( partial ) description of the probability distribution on the set of boolean functions .",
    "the case of 2-xor expressions is such a problem , and this paper is devoted to presenting our results in this domain .    consider random 2-xor - sat instances with a large number  @xmath2 of variables , and  @xmath3 of clauses .",
    "creignou and daud established that their limit probability of satisfiability goes from positive values to zero when the ratio  @xmath4 crosses  @xmath6 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they then proved that this threshold is coarse ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) . further work by daud and ravelomanana @xcite and by pittel and yeum @xcite led to a precise understanding of the transition in a window of size @xmath7 around  @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present in the next section 2-xor expressions and the set of boolean functions that they can represent .",
    "then we give a modelization of these expressions in terms of multigraphs , before considering in section  [ sec : probas ] how enumeration results on classes of multigraphs allow us to compute probabilities of boolean functions .",
    "we then give explicit results for several classes of functions in section  [ sec : results ] , and conclude with a discussion on the relevance and of possible extensions of our work in section  5 .",
    "a preliminary version of our work was presented at the conference latin14  @xcite .",
    "in this section we will lay out the framework of boolean expressions which we will investigate .",
    "if @xmath8 is a boolean variable , we will denote by @xmath9 its negation .",
    "let @xmath10 be a set of boolean variables .",
    "a 2-xor expression is a finite conjunction of clauses @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are literals , i.e. they are elements of @xmath14 .    the clauses as well as the literals within each clause are ordered ( i.e. for instance that the clauses @xmath15 and @xmath16 are distinct ) . from a combinatorial point of view , an expression can be regarded as a _ sequence _ of clauses where each clause is a pair of two literals . neither the literals of a clause nor the clauses themselves need to be distinct .",
    "the set of all such expressions is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "we say that a 2-xor expression _ defines _ , or _",
    "computes _ , the corresonding boolean function .",
    "we shall denote the number of clauses of an expression by @xmath3 .",
    "now each 2-xor expression defines a boolean function on a finite number of variables , but not all boolean functions on a finite number of variables can be represented by a 2-xor expression .",
    "we define  @xmath18 as the set of functions from @xmath19 to @xmath20 which have at least one representation by a 2-xor expression in @xmath21 .",
    "we also define , for each @xmath22 , the set @xmath23 of functions in @xmath18 such that there exists an expression in @xmath17 representing the function .",
    "this implies that @xmath24 for @xmath25 , and that @xmath26 . or the set @xmath27 , according to the context . ]",
    "consider now the expressions in @xmath17 .",
    "there there are @xmath28 distinct clauses .",
    "we assume that the @xmath3 clauses are drawn with a uniform probability ( and hence with replacement ) .",
    "this framework allows us to define , for each  @xmath3 , a probability distribution on the set  @xmath23 :    let @xmath29 be the total number of expressions with @xmath3 clauses on the variables @xmath30 ,  ,",

    "for example , the total number of multigraphs with @xmath2 vertices and @xmath3 edges is @xmath166 and the number of cubic multigraphs ( _ i.e. _ multigraphs where all the vertices have degree @xmath167 ) with @xmath168 vertices is @xmath169 because such multigraphs have @xmath170 edges .",

    "we obtain @xmath585 and the saddle point equation simplifies to @xmath586 note that for @xmath225 we have @xmath587 ; @xmath588 can be expressed in terms of the bernoulli numbers , such that @xmath589 in a neighbourhood of zero .",
    "thus , we obtain the solution @xmath563 of the saddle point equation , with @xmath590 , by a bootstrapping procedure .",
    "first , we obtain @xmath565 a second bootstrapping step gives the refinement @xmath591 changing the integration path to @xmath592 , @xmath593 gives for @xmath532 @xmath594 since @xmath595 we obtain further @xmath596 the function @xmath597 is maximal at @xmath598 .",

    "the structure of solutions of satisfiable expressions , which corresponds to the component structure of the associated multigraphs , is also important .",
    "we derived expressions in terms of coefficients of generating functions for the probability of satisfiability in the critical region ( @xmath610 ) as well as a general expression for the probability of any function ( theorem  [ th : proba - f ] ) .",

    "the only missing case is that of two large components which are not proportional in size .",

    "apart from extensions of our results to cover , e.g. , the extension of theorem  [ th : multigraphs - large - excess ] to the supercritical case , or of proposition  [ th : asympt_proportional ] to a larger number of edges , what is missing is an asymptotic analysis of functions on the boundaries true  and false  having a more irregular component structure as well as the study of functions in the intermediate range .",
