    "the search for a so - called ` unified model ' of agn has spanned more than two decades @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that some type 2 seyferts may comprise a type 1 seyfert nucleus that is heavily obscured by a dense , dusty torus ( @xcite ) .",
    "although dusty tori obscure some of the nuclear continuum emission , a significant fraction escapes along the poles of the central source , producing a cone - shaped extended emission line region .",
    "perhaps the most spectacular example occurs in the type 2 seyfert galaxy ngc5252 where bipolar [ oiii ]  cones are seen to extend to @xmath730 kpc in radius @xcite .",
    "this important phenomenon allows one to test the unified model by analyzing the ionization properties of the gas within the cones .",
    "many of the phenomena we observe from active galaxies arise from the properties of the accretion disk .",
    "@xcite note that the power density spectrum of an active galaxy resembles those observed in some galactic black hole x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , such as cygx-1 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the transient behaviour of xrbs , however , may render ` the scaling from stellar - to - supermassive black hole mass ' a false argument @xcite .",
    "but if appropriate corrections are made for the variations in the accretion rate , the variability timescales may be related @xcite .",
    "if the mass - scaling hypothesis for black holes is correct , it is natural to question why we have not observed ionization cones associated with xrbs in previous work .",
    "this may reflect the difficulty of interpreting the complex nebulosity in the vicinity of xrbs due to a background of competing sources , e.g. hot young stars .",
    "the xrb lmcx-1 is surrounded by a complex filamentary emission - line nebula , catalogued by @xcite as n159f .",
    "the x - ray source ( @xmath8 \\approx2\\times10^{38}\\ , { \\rm erg\\,\\,s}^{-1}$ ] , @xcite ) comprises a stellar mass ( @xmath9 ) black hole accreting matter from an o7iii - type star ( `` star 32 '' ) . based on the heii@xmath1 emission line",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that n159f was the first example of an x - ray ionized nebula .",
    "@xcite supported the presence of an x - ray ionized nebula , and concluded that lmcx-1 ` is not injecting a significant amount of mechanical energy into the interstellar medium , ' contrary to the findings of @xcite ( hereafter , paperi ) , who recently suggested that the nebula surrounding lmcx-1 is largely driven by a jet emanating from the xrb .",
    "the latter study used integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) to delineate the complex ionization regions within the nebula .",
    "the two studies prior to paperi  used 1d slit spectroscopy , a technique that is spatially more limited than ifs .",
    "once again we appeal to ifs to obtain a complete spatial coverage of the nebula .",
    "the motivation behind our new study is to assess the extent of hard ionizing photons by tracing the heii  and [ oiii ]  emission .",
    "in the course of our work , we have discovered an ionization cone associated with this xrb , the first of its kind .",
    "moreover , the ionization cone aligns with the putative jet from paperi , a phenomenon also observed in agns @xcite .",
    "not only does this provide a new ground for testing accretion disk phenomena , but it also strengthens the mass - scaling hypothesis , implying that accretion processes around stellar - mass black holes are similar to accretion processes around supermassive black holes .",
    "we summarize the observations and data reduction procedures in  2 . in  3 , we derive the cone parameters and discuss the ionizing source .",
    "our interpretation and conclusions are summarized in  4 .",
    "after presenting our previous results on lmcx-1 ( paperi ) , we were alerted to archival visible multi - object spectrograph ( vimos ) ifs observations ( program i d : 076.c-0284(b ) ) of n159f , which were acquired in @xmath10 seeing on 2005 , october 1 , and 27 .",
    "four 900sec vimos exposures were taken in high - resolution mode , two using the blue grism ( r@xmath11 ) and two using the orange grism ( r@xmath12 ) .",
    "the spectral range includes the prominent optical emission lines [ oi ] , [ oiii ] , hei , heii , [ ariii ] , [ nii ] , [ sii ] , h@xmath2  and h@xmath13 , all of which are important diagnostics for delineating regions containing multiple ionizing sources , and estimating the electron density and temperature .",
    "the two exposures with each grism were offset east - west by @xmath14 ( @xmath15 pixels ) and north - south by @xmath16 ( @xmath17 pixels ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the reduction pipeline vipgi @xcite .",
    "the reduced data were converted into 3d datacubes and combined using the same data manipulation routines implemented in paperi . at the spectral resolution of the vimos grisms ,",
    "all lines were found to be well approximated by a single unresolved gaussian profile .",
    "[ figure : heii_oiii](a ) immediately highlights the anisotropy of heii  emission and its correlation with the [ oiii ]  emission ( see paperi ) , which is the first evidence that isotropic ionization by lmcx-1 is unlikely .",
    "an ionization cone is revealed when taking the ratio of these high ionization emission lines with respect to h@xmath2  ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : heii_oiii](b ) &  ( c ) ) , as these line ratios are strongly dependent on the ratio of the ionizing photon intensity and the gas density ( i.e. ionization parameter ) at a fixed gas abundance .",
    "jets , winds , and cones are often asymmetric and this may arise from the source or be due to large - scale dust or the presence of gas . the one - sided cone is observed in the direction of the putative jet ( refer to paperi ) .    the [ oiii]@xmath18 ratio is a good diagnostic of nebular temperature , while the [ sii]@xmath19 ratio provides an estimate of the electron number density when the ratio of this doublet is between @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) @xcite . we derive an electron temperature @xmath24 and an electron number density @xmath25 in the ionization cone , with an uncertainty of about 10% .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is revised downwards from paperi  due to the improved data and is close to the low - density limit of this line diagnostic .",
    "it is noteworthy that outside the ionization cone the nebular temperature declines by @xmath27 .",
    "we note that lmcx-1 borders the giant hii  region complex n159 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore likely that other nearby sources contribute to some of the ionization in n159f , which could explain some of the ` excess ' emission around lmcx-1 . in  3.2 ,",
    "we show that since the luminous stellar companion to lmcx-1 ( star 32 ) makes a negligible contribution to the cone energetics , the ionizing luminosity can only arise from lmcx-1 .",
    "furthermore , we find that the cone largely arises from photoionization rather than jet - powered shock ionization for two reasons .",
    "first , the nebula temperature is substantially cooler than expected for shock - heated gas at any metallicity @xcite .",
    "secondly , radiative shock models predict an onset of heii@xmath1 emission for shock speeds @xmath28 @xcite . however , we showed in paper i that the lmcx-1 jet is triggering a shock with a shock velocity that is unlikely to exceed @xmath29 .",
    "ionization cones provide a _ direct _ measure of the flux of the ionizing continuum from the accretion disk if the geometry and orientation are clearly defined @xcite . for the one - sided cone , we measure its position angle , half - opening angle and length to be pa@xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively ; however , these are subject to the inclination angle of the cone to our line - of - sight , @xmath33 @xcite",
    ". therefore , the true half - opening angle , cone length and cone solid angle are respectively @xmath34 \\simeq 22{\\hbox{$^{\\circ}$}}$ ] , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . for our inferred @xmath26 and @xmath37 ,",
    "the ionization cone is optically thick to h@xmath38 lyman continuum photons ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , and he@xmath41 lyman continuum photons ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "however , the ionization cone is optically thin to photons above @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "we now use the observed x - ray spectrum to derive our first estimate of the ionizing flux from lmcx-1 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is best - fitted by a comptonized multicolor disk ( cmcd ) model @xcite . however , for energies @xmath45 , the x - ray spectrum of lmcx-1 can be approximated by the simple multicolor disk ( mcd ) model ( fig .  2 , @xcite ) . the mcd model presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : xray_spectrum ] adopts the following parameters : @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the inner disk temperature , and @xmath49 is a normalizing constant .",
    "we present this model with and without line - of - sight attenuation ( @xmath50 ) .    since @xmath49 depends on the assumed inclination angle @xmath51 , we set @xmath52 to determine the ionizing luminosity within the cone .",
    "we determine the absorption - corrected photon flux from @xmath53 to @xmath54 and @xmath55 to @xmath54 along our line - of - sight to be @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "therefore the number of h@xmath38 and he@xmath41 lyman continuum photons _ in the cone _ produced by the x - ray source is @xmath58 at the distance ( @xmath59 , @xcite ) to the lmc .",
    "the subscript ` @xmath60 ' indicates that these were obtained from an extrapolation of the x - ray model .    from the vimos data",
    ", we measure the extinction corrected heii@xmath1 flux of the cone to be @xmath61 ( @xmath62(b@xmath63v)@xmath64 , @xcite ) corresponding to a _ cone _ luminosity @xmath65 .",
    "if we assume case b recombination , from the ratio of the total to effective recombination coefficients , @xmath66 ( for t=@xmath67 , @xcite ) , we estimate ( eq .  41 , @xcite ) @xmath68 powers the cone , where @xmath69 @xmath70 2.6 ev .",
    "this estimate would be higher still if the covering factor of the gas in the ionization cone was less than unity .",
    "considering the well - established metal deficiency of the lmc ( @xmath71 ) , if star 32 was _ solely _ responsible for the ionization cone , its stellar temperature would need to be in excess of @xmath72 @xcite , which is inconsistent with the known value , @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "however , star 32 is capable of producing photons with energies @xmath74 , and assuming it radiates _ isotropically _ , it will produce @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "therefore star 32 produces insufficient he@xmath41 lyman continuum photons to explain the observed ionization cone .",
    "we now derive a new estimate of @xmath76 that is independent of the extrapolation from the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath3/[oii]@xmath77 ratio in the cone provides us with a direct determination of the ionization parameter @xmath78 for a gas with known metallicity @xcite .",
    "due to the insufficient spectral coverage of the vimos blue grism , the [ oii ]  lines are not present in the vimos datacube .",
    "instead , we use the [ oiii]/[oii ]  ratio ( @xmath79 ) determined from  position 1 \" @xcite . for the lmc gas phase abundance",
    ", this ratio corresponds to a unique ionization parameter @xmath80 @xcite due to the differential dependence of oxygen ions on the ionization rate .",
    "thus @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the characteristic radius of the cone ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "outside the cone , there is a decrease in @xmath78 at increasing radius from lmcx-1 .",
    "for example , the [ oiii]/[oii ]  ratio at a distance of @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) north - east of lmcx-1 (  position 2 , \" @xcite ) is indicative of an ionization parameter @xmath86 .",
    "by comparing eq . ( 1)-(4 ) , the yao model underestimates the number of ionizing photons emerging from the accretion disk by a factor of @xmath87 .",
    "this discrepancy requires an extra component that dominates in the uv and/or soft x - ray bands . in the yao model",
    ", we can not increase @xmath49 because it is constrained beyond @xmath88 by the observed hard x - ray spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xray_spectrum ] ) , which is modelled as comptonized disk emission .",
    "we note that the size of the discrepancy arising from eq .",
    "( 1)-(4 ) is exaggerated by the use of a photon number ; the energy requirement is only a factor of two more than the yao model .",
    "this could conceivably arise from upscattering of lower energy photons from more distant regions in the disk by a hot coronal plasma in the inner region .",
    "alternatively , a sizeable fraction of the hard x - ray photons could be degraded to lower energies , i.e. in the opposite sense to what is assumed in the cmcd model .",
    "it is noteworthy that some agn ionization cones can only be explained by the contribution of both ionization from the non - stellar nuclear continuum and jet - induced shock ionization @xcite .",
    "therefore an _ in situ _ jet may also contribute to the lmcx-1 cone , although the nebular temperature limits any contribution from shock processes .",
    "euv / soft x - ray excesses are not uncommon to agn .",
    "the spectra of high redshift quasars , which can be observed in the uv , clearly exhibit a big blue bump component , widely attributed to accretion disk emission @xcite .",
    "this component has also been inferred from the emission - line diagnostics of seyfert 2 ionization cones @xcite . in some cases , euv /",
    "soft x - ray excesses are _ also _ observed .",
    "the origin of this component is unclear , but it may arise , for example , from thermal emission in a warm / hot cloud at a temperature that peaks in the @xmath89ev range @xcite . how this component relates to the accretion disk",
    "is not clear .",
    "it is unlikely that the angular extent of the ionization cone reflects the poloidal ionizing field of the naked accretion disk .",
    "there are two plausible explanations for the anisotropic radiation pattern : ( 1 ) obscuration by a dusty torus , or ( 2 ) a jet - blown hole in the envelope of circumstellar absorbing material @xcite .",
    "we suspect that obscuring xrb tori would scale to agn tori with the mass accretion rate rather than the black hole mass .",
    "the mass accretion rate in xrbs depends on the donor star , whereas for agn , it depends on the gas fuel supply from the surrounding interstellar medium . because star 32 is a giant , we would expect an excess mass flux to accumulate somewhere before reaching the accretion disk .",
    "this accumulated mass flux could form something akin to an obscuring torus . by analogy with agn @xcite , high angular resolution ,",
    "mid - infrared observations of lmcx-1 are required to confirm the presence of a dusty torus .",
    "here we have demonstrated the importance of ionization cones for establishing the xuv properties of obscured accretion disks .",
    "we suspect the ionization cone will also be observable in [ neiii]@xmath90 and [ nev]@xmath91 ( ionization potential @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively ) .",
    "these arise at higher @xmath78 values and will therefore allow us to probe down to smaller radii . indeed , @xcite have already detected these two high ionization species in the immediate vicinity of lmcx-1 .",
    "but due to the limited spatial coverage of their spectroscopic technique , we are unable to confirm that these ratios are enhanced in the direction of the ionization cone .",
    "planned future observations will probe the structure of the ionization cone , allowing us to refine our ionization model and place tighter constraints on the nature of the ionizing source .",
    "this discovery paper is dedicated to the memory of a.  s. wilson at the university of maryland who made seminal contributions to the field of active galactic nuclei .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee whose comments and suggestions improved the paper considerably .",
