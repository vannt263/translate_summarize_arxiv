    "about 10 - 20 % optically selected qsos exhibit broad absorption troughs in resonant lines up to 0.1c blueward of the corresponding emission lines ( hewett & foltz 2003 , reichard et al .",
    "usually the broad absorption lines ( bal ) are detected only in high ionization ones , such as civ , nv , siiv and ovi , named high ionized bal ( hibal ) , but 10% of bal qsos show also low ionization lines ( libal ) , such as mgii , aliii and even feii .",
    "the blue shift of the absorption lines suggests that they are formed in a partially ionized wind , outflowing from the quasar",
    ". the observed flux ratios of the emission to absorption line imply that the covering factor of the bal region ( balr ) be @xmath7 20% ( hamann , korista & morris 1993 ) .",
    "futhermore , the properties of uv / x - ray continuum and emission lines of bal qsos and non - bal qsos are also found to be similar ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; reichard et al .",
    "2003 ; green et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these facts lead to a general picture that balr covers only a small fraction of sky and may be present in every quasar ( weymann et al . 1991 ) .",
    "we note there are evidences suggesting that libal qsos are in a special evolution phase of quasars rather than merely viewed on a special inclination ( voit , weymann & korista 1993 ; canalizo & stockton 2001 ; c.f . , willott , rawlings , & grimes 2003 ; lewis , chapman , & kuncic 2003 ) .    the evidence for non - spherical balr is also supported by the discovery that bal qsos are usually more polarized than non - bal qsos ( ogle et al .",
    "bal qso is the only high polarization population among the radio quiet qsos ( e.g. , stockman , moore & angel 1984 ) .",
    "stockman et al .",
    "found 9 of 30 bal qsos show high polarization ( @xmath8 ) in the optical continuum .",
    "the result was confirmed later by schmidt & hines ( 1999 ) , who found the average polarization degree of bal qsos is 2.4 times that of the optically selected quasars .",
    "consistently , hutsem@xmath9kers & lamy ( 2001 ) obtained average polarization degrees of @xmath4 0.43@xmath10 , 0.93@xmath10 and 1.46@xmath10 for non - bal qsos , hibal qsos and libal qsos respectively .",
    "this result is similar to that of schmidt & hines ( 1999 ) : 0.4@xmath10 and 1.0@xmath10 for non - bal and bal qsos .",
    "it is also evident that the polarization distribution of non - bal qsos drops sharply toward high polarization ( see also berriman et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "bal qsos are notorious x - ray weak following the work of green & mathur ( 1996 ; see also brinkmann et al .",
    "now we have strong evidences that the weakness in x - rays is not intrinsic but due to strong x - ray absorption , with the hydrogen column density of a few 10@xmath0 to @xmath1 10@xmath2  @xmath3 ( wang et al .",

    ". the x - ray absorber might be responsible for the recently detected blueshifted x - ray bals , suggesting they are outflowing at even higher velocities and highly ionized ( chartas et al .",
    "2002 ; 2003 ) .",
    "the electronic scattering in the thick x - ray absorber may contribute significantly to the observed continuum polarization for both bal qsos and non - bal qoss , if balr exists in every quasar . in this paper",
    ", we perform detailed calculations and monte carlo simulations to study the polarization produced by electronic scattering in the balr . by comparing the expected polarizations with the observed ones , we give strong contraints to the balr model .",
    "there are many dynamic models for the bal outflow , depending on the flow type ( hydrodynamic or hydromagnetic flow ) and the accelerating mechanisms ( radiation , gas pressure or magnetic field ) . in most models ,",
    "the flow is accelerated through the resonant line scattering , which is supported by the line - locking phenomena .",
    "a general difficulty of such models , however , is to prevent the flow from being fully ionized while its average density drops rapidly with increasing radius .",
    "one solution proposed by murry & chiang ( 1995 , hereafter mc95 ) is that the flow is shielded from the intense soft x - ray radiation by highly ionized medium in the inner region with a typical column density of a few @xmath11 @xmath3 to 10@xmath2  @xmath3 .",
    "this shielding gas can also account for the observed heavy x - ray absorption .",
    "this model is in qualitative agreement with more recent hydrodynamic calculation of the radiative accelerated wind from an accretion disk ( proga , stone & kallman .",
    "the second solution is the two - phase flow , in which a dense , low ionization , cold clouds are embeded in a highly ionized , hot and tenuous medium .",
    "the cold clouds with a small filling factor , accelerated by the line and continuum radiation pressure to high velocities , is responsible for the bal features .",
    "an implement to the second scheme is the massive hydromagnetic and radiative driven wind model . in the model , the massive high - ionized continuous outflow is driven centrifugally , and accelerated radiatively by the central continuum source ( everett 2002 ; konigl & kartje 1994 ; de kool & begelman 1995 ) .",
    "the total column density of the hot medium is also very large ( with n@xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath3 ) .",
    "in fact such a medium itself can also be considered as the shielding gas .",
    "a third scheme is the dusty wind due to the mass loss of stars in the nucleus ; both the dust absorption and the line scattering contribute to the accelerating force of the gas ( voit et al .",
    "1993 ; scoville & norman 1995 ) .",
    "following mc95 , we assume an equatorial and axisymmetric outflow , with a half open angle @xmath14 ( see fig . [ model ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the continuum polarization produced by the electronic scattering in the outflow , and leave the study of the resonant scattering , which can produce obvious polarization around the broad absorption trough , in a future paper ( wang et al . in prep ) . the shielding gas is the major source of the electronic scattering and x - ray photo - electronic absorption .",
    "since both the scattering and x - ray absorption are insensitive to the density profile of the shielding gas , we assume a constant electron density in this region .",
    "we consider a range of column densities ( @xmath11 to @xmath15  @xmath3 ) for this region , consistent with that obtained from the x - ray observations .",

    "the impact of the radiative transfer to the polarization degree is apparent in the figure . basically , because of the attenuation of the direct continuum",
    ", the radiative thransfer causes larger polariztion for bal qsos than that from the analytic calculation . for non - bal qsos ,",
    "the situation is more complex . for a model with small @xmath14",
    "= @xmath67 , the optical depth at small inclination angle is smaller , consequently the scattered photons escape more likely along the polar direction , which results in slightly larger ( smaller ) polariztion at smaller ( larger ) inclinations .",
    "however , for a model with larger @xmath14 = @xmath68 , the attenuation of the scattered light becomes important , which reduces the polarization for non - bal qsos .",
    "we point out that , in additional to the observed average polarization degrees for bal and non - bal qsos , the distribution of the observed polarization of a radio quiet qso sample can provide further constraints to the model of the scatterer .",
    "we consider the optically thin case first . for a given axisymmetric electron - scatterer ,",
    "the polarization degrees at different view angles @xmath35 follow eq .",
    "[ eq : p_e ] .",
    "the normalized distribution of the polarization degree can thus be written as    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the polarization degree viewed at the direction perpendicular to the symmetric axis .",
    "note @xmath70 depends on the optical depth and the geometry of the scatterer .",
    "we notice that the distribution is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath29 for a given scatterer .",
    "monte - carlo simulations , which taking account of radiative transfer for larger optical depth , give similar result ( see . fig .",
    "[ fdp0205 ] ) .",
    "however , an opposite trend was found in the observed distributions given by stockman et al ( 1984 ) and berriman et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , who found the observed distribution of polarization degree of all qsos ( including bal qsos ) decreases with increasing @xmath29 above 0.2% .",
    "we argue that the discrepancy might also be explained by a dispersal distribution of the properties of the shielding gas . here",
    "considering a distribution of @xmath70 as @xmath71 , we can write formally the distribution of @xmath29 as    @xmath72    if the observed distribution of the polarization is known , we can solve the above equation inversely , e.g.,through richardson - lucy approach , to obtain the @xmath71 , which in turn can be used to constrain the geometry of the scatterer . using the polarization distribution of qsos presented by stockman et",
    "al ( 1984 , see fig . 1 in their paper ) ,",
    "which can be described approximately with    @xmath73    we obtain @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fp0 ] , which rises steeply toward lower @xmath70 with a peak at @xmath74 .",
    "this suggests that the shielding gas in a large fraction of qsos either have smaller column density , or smaller covering factor .",
    "note that @xmath6 = @xmath75 is much smaller than the average continuum polarization of bal qsos which is 0.93% .",
    "this suggests that most of the quasars have balr with covering factor much smaller than 0.2 , thus these balr make less contribution to the observed sample of bal qsos because of the smaller chance to be detected .",
    "a larger sample of radio quiet quasars with accurate measurement of the continuum polarization will help give better constraints to the distribution of the balr properties .",
    "note the observed distribution at the small polarization end ( @xmath76 ) was not well constrained because of the limited accuracy of the measurements , thus the resulted shape of @xmath71 has large uncertainty .",
    "note that the derived @xmath71 is also valid for axisymmetric scattering models , including the polar scattering models ( e.g. , ogle 1997 ; lamy & hutsemkers 2004 ) and possible bi - conical scattering model ( elvis 2000 ) .",
    "the reason is that the polarization produced by axisymmetric outflow is @xmath77 , but independent to the outflow model ( eq.[eq : p_e ] ) .    in passing , we point out that the average level , as well as the angle - dependence , of the polarization degree may be affected by the anisotropic emission of the continuum source , which is neglected in the above calculations",
    ". certain levels of anisotropy are expected in optically thick accretion disk models , which usually predict stronger emission in polar directions than on the equatorial plane .",
    "in such models , the average polarization degree would be lowered in our equatorial scatterer model , and the polarization degree increases with inclination faster than in the case of isotropic continuum emission .",
    "however , we believe that the anisotropic emission would not severely affect our results for two reasons",
    ". first , bal qsos are at least as luminous as non - bal qsos .",
    "second , we do not find anti - correlation between the polarization degree and the continuum luminosity ( moore , r. l. & stockman , h. s. 1984 ) , which is expected in a model with anisotropic continuum .",
    "we show that the x - ray absorber in the bal qsos is capable to reproduce the observed continuum polarization for both bal qsos and non - bal qsos .",
    "however , the covering factor of the balr in quasars is required to have a dispersal distribution , instead of a @xmath52 function .",
    "we also find that to macth the observed distribution of the continuum polarization of radio quiet quasars , the balr in most qsos produces much smaller maximum continuum polarization @xmath78 ( while viewed edge - on ) with a peak at @xmath78 = 0.34% , which is much smaller than the average continuum polarization of bal qsos , which is 0.93% .",
    "consequently , the bal qsos with small @xmath78 are likely to have covering factor of balr much smaller than 0.2 , thus make less contribution to the observed sample of bal qsos because of the smaller chance to be detected .",
