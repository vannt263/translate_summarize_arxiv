    "interfaces obtained by assembling insulating , non - magnetic perovskite oxides can show unexpected properties such as high conductivity and ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "oxygen vacancies @xcite , epitaxial strain @xcite , the so - called `` polarization catastrophe '' from interface - generated dipoles @xcite and electronic reconstruction at the interface @xcite are all at play in perovskite oxides and their individual roles are still far from being understood .",
    "an important case is the interface of manganites thin films with other different oxides , providing tunnel junctions for a number of manganite - based devices , such as spin valve or spin injectors . in this context",
    ", several authors have investigated the properties of ultra - thin manganite films on various substrates and it has been found at the double exchange ( de ) magneto - transport properties are strongly depressed below a critical thickness @xcite .",
    "to explain such a behavior , nanoscale inhomogeneities with coexisting clusters of different stable phases have been extensively investigated , but it is still uncertain if and how this acts on the suppression of the magneto - transport properties of ultrathin films @xcite .",
    "chemical composition , strain and oxygen stoichiometry are considered the main parameters influencing the disorder - driven phase separation @xcite . in thin films of la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 ( lsmo )",
    "the existence of intrinsic inhomogeneities has been explained in terms of structural macroscopic distortions induced by the strain with the substrate which favors preferential orbital occupation of the @xmath5 mn orbitals @xcite . while in the case of lsmo films grown on laalo@xmath3 substrate",
    "the suppression of the de magneto - transport properties is a `` bulk '' effect caused by strong in - plane compressive epitaxial strain , in the case of the lsmo films grown on srtio@xmath6 ( weak tensile strain ) and ndgao@xmath3 ( almost unstrained ) the same phenomenon is a pure `` interface / surface '' effect @xcite .",
    "broken symmetry at the interfaces to the substrate and to the vacuum drives the orbital reorganization in ultrathin lsmo films , thus favoring the occupation of the @xmath7 versus the @xmath8 orbitals among the otherwise energy degenerate mn @xmath4 states at the mn@xmath9 sites , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in addition , it has been recently reported @xcite that structure and stoichiometry gradually change at the interface of ultrathin lsmo films on sto , with a resulting elongation of the interfacial out - of - plane lattice constant .",
    "such structural modification is similar to the cooperative jahn - teller - like distortion induced by the in - plane compressive strain , which in turn favors the stabilization of the @xmath7 orbitals . as a result",
    ", the disproportion in @xmath5 orbital occupation induces a coupling between neighboring mn cations that is ferromagnetic ( fm ) along the @xmath10-axis ( perpendicular to the surface ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) in the @xmath11 plane @xcite , eventually resulting in the stabilization of the c - type af phase at low temperature @xcite . however , such magnetic phase was not directly experimentally observed .",
    "orbital occupation is @xmath12 and @xmath13 in case of srtio@xmath6 ( a ) and laalo@xmath3 ( b ) substrate respectively .",
    "the preferential orbital occupation is @xmath13 at both interfaces.,width=8 ]    while the `` bulk '' magnetic properties have been largely investigated in manganite films as a function of the strain@xcite , the microscopic origin of the magnetic properties at the films surface and at the interface between film and substrate have not yet been completely clarified . in this respect experimental investigations by surface sensitive x - ray magnetic scattering of layered manganite single crystals @xcite and of perovskite manganite thin films @xcite have shown that the average in - plane fm ordering of the surface is significantly suppressed over a length scale of about 4 unit cells ( u.c . ) from the surface , even at low temperature .",
    "however , those measurements alone can not discriminate between a homogeneous suppression of the magnetization over the surface and the coexistence of fm and af phases .",
    "thus , to detect both af and fm phases , we have chosen two magnetically complementary techniques such as x - ray magnetic linear dichroism ( xmld ) and x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) in soft x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) by synchrotron radiation .",
    "such techniques were already successfully employed to observe the directional coupling by exchange bias between the spins in the af regions and those in the adjacent fm regions in different magnetic systems@xcite . therefore , xmld and xmcd are the ideal techniques to study the arrangement of spins , together with the orbital occupancy , at interfaces in manganite films where af and fm phases coexist on a nanometric scale .",
    "while strain induced selective orbital occupancy has been recently reported in refs @xcite , the orbital reconstruction at the interface has been questioned by huijben _",
    "et al_.@xcite , on the basis of apparently very different linear dichroism experimental results .",
    "actually the xld of ref @xcite is not totally incompatible with that of ref .",
    "@xcite if one takes into account the fact that the former were measured at low temperature , where the magnetic contribution to xld is strong , whereas the latter were taken above the curie temperature , where the only contribution to xld comes from the preferential orbital occupation .",
    "moreover the interpretation given by huijben _",
    "et al_. of the xld is surprisingly opposite to that of numerous papers with experimental and theoretical contents @xcite .",
    "interestingly , huijben _",
    "et al_.@xcite have also reported that the spin to orbital - ordered coupled insulator phase develop at the interface .",
    "therefore , the microscopic origin of the magneto - transport properties at the interface of lsmo films is still under debate . here",
    "we report the experimental evidence of the spin - orbit - lattice coupling at the interface of lsmo films . to achieve this result , we have compared lsmo films grown on srtio@xmath6 ( 100 ) ( sto ) , ndgao@xmath3 ( 110 ) ( ngo ) or laalo@xmath3 ( 100 ) ( lao ) , and having different thicknesses so to have different strain conditions and to cross the metal - insulator transition at different temperatures . the high surface sensitivity of both xmld and xmcd allowed to obtain information on the very thin lsmo layer at the interface with the substrate .",

    "2a ) . thanks also to its exceptional sensitivity ( it can probe fm samples down to a fraction of monolayer thick ) , xmcd can be used as an element specific magnetometric technique , as shown by the hysteresis loops in fig .  2b , obtained by the maximum peak intensity of the xmcd ( about 642 ev ) as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "in principle , orbital and spin magnetic moments can be obtained from the analysis of the xmcd spectra .",
    "+ on the other hand , it has been shown theoretically and experimentally @xcite that xld can have two different contributions , either magnetic or related to the orbital occupation .",
    "if the direction of the spin system has a component in the plane perpendicular to the propagation direction of the x - ray beam it is possible , by changing the linear polarization from h to v , to observe a magnetic dichroic signal ( xmld ) , which can be non - zero also in the case of af ordering@xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the mn @xmath4 orbitals are anisotropically populated , in addition to the magnetic contribution , an orbital contribution shows up in the xld spectra .",
    "the orbital contribution to xld in mn@xmath9 is caused by the anisotropy in the bonding and is strictly related to the occupation of the @xmath7 or @xmath25 orbitals . because the magnetic order vanishes above the magnetic order temperature , xld measurements performed at room temperature are only sensitive to the preferential orbital occupation .",
    "room temperature xld curves of fig .",
    "4b and fig .",
    "5b are typical of the @xmath7 preferential occupation induced by the interface symmetry in very thin films@xcite , whatever the sign of the mismatch between film and substrate .",
    "furthermore , below the magnetic transition temperature , by applying a magnetic field parallel to the incident photon beam , it is possible to suppress selectively the fm contribution to the xmld spectrum thus singling out the af contribution .",
    "in such a geometry , if the applied field is strong enough , magnetization in the fm system is forced to align along the direction of the incident beam .",
    "therefore , the fm contribution to the xmld is suppressed because the spin system is orthogonal to both the v and h polarization directions . on the other hand , spin orientation in the af phase",
    "is not affected by an external field , so that no major changes in the xmld spectra under external field are expected for the af phase . + normalized xld spectra as a function of temperature for lsmo films grown on sto and lao",

    "thick lsmo film on sto is shown in fig .",

    "as reported in table i , the 10 u.c .",
    "thick film on sto has a depressed @xmath27 and becomes metallic only below 275 k , because of the proximity to the critical thickness for the suppression of the magnetotransport properties ( about 7 u.c . for films grown on sto and ngo)@xcite .",
    "xld spectrum measured at 300k , above the magnetic transition temperature , is scarcely influenced by the application of a 1 t magnetic field , as expected .",
    "the intensity and shape of the xld curves changes dramatically when the film is cooled below the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "large intensity changes of the xld spectra with temperature reveal the magnetic dependence of the dichroic signal .",
    "furthermore , below the ordering temperature , the application of a 1 t field along the x ray beam direction results in a full reversal of the xld curves relative to the zero field case .",
    "such an effect is a consequence of the field induced suppression of the fm contribution to the xld signal which is left with the af contribution alone .",
    "the substantial presence of fm phase even in a sample with reduced @xmath27 is confirmed by the xmcd measurements of fig .",
    "2a and b. the observed changing with temperature of the xld shape is related to the different easy - axis orientation , i.e. local magnetic moment preferential orientation , of the prevalent magnetic phase at the corresponding temperature .",
    "+ a different behavior is shown in fig.5b for the 30 u.c .",
    "thick film on lao . in this case , the sizeable in - plane compressive epitaxial strain induced by the substrate strongly affects the magneto - transport properties@xcite , thus resulting in an insulating behaviour over the whole temperature range .",
    "the xld spectra at @xmath28  t and @xmath29  t are similar at all temperatures indicating that the signal comes here mainly from an af phase .",
    "although , the xmcd measurements of fig .",
    "3a and b demonstrates the presence of a sizeable fm contribution even in this sample , in spite of the depressed magneto - transport properties .",
    "the domains dispersion of such fm metallic phase is supposed to be below the percolation limit for the charge transport because of the insulating character of the 30 u.c .",
    "lsmo film on lao .",
    "the additional presence at the interface of the @xmath30-rich fm insulating ( fmi ) phase@xcite has to be also considered .",
    "+ in order to strengthen the scenario outlined above , we have subtracted the orbital contribution to the xld spectra . to do this",
    "we assumed that the orbital contribution to xld is negligibly sensitive to the temperature , and plotted the difference between the xld spectra measured below and above the magnetic ordering temperature : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the magnetic part of the linear dichroism signal .",
    "the @xmath32 spectra for lsmo samples with different thickness on sto and on lao are shown in fig .",
    "xmld spectra with b=0 t are sensitive to both the af and fm phases , while with b=1 t only the contribution of the af phase is detected . 1 t is enough to saturate the fm phase in the given geometry as demonstrated by the hysteresis loops of figs .",

    "peak height signals .",
    "the schematics of the magnetization easy axes directions are reported on the top of the figure for sto and lao substrates , on the left and on the right , respectively.,width=8 ]    as reported in table i , the 50 u.c .",
    "thick film on sto ( fig .",
    "6a ) and the 100 u.c .",
    "thick film on lao ( fig .",
    "6c ) are both metallic above room temperature .",
    "the sizeable field induced suppression of the difference spectrum in the case of the thicker film on lao ( fig .",
    "6c ) indicates the predominance of the fm phase . on the contrary , when the film thickness is decreased ( 30 u.c . on lao ,",
    "6d ) , the @xmath32 amplitudes at @xmath28  t and @xmath29  t become comparable , in agreement with the predominance of the af phase .",
    "moreover , it can be noticed that the fm and af signals have the same qualitative behavior , which is a clear indication that the spin system has the same orientation in the two cases . on the other hand , it has been reported that the magnetization easy - axis of manganite films grown under compressive strain ( lao substrates ) is perpendicular to the substrate @xcite .",
    "therefore , both the fm and af easy axes are perpendicular to the substrate ( @xmath10-axis ) .",
    "such a finding , in agreement with the @xmath7 nature of the orbital contribution to xld , confirms the development of the c - type af phase , where spins are perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "for the two lsmo films on sto at @xmath28  t the curves are completely reversed with respect to those of films grown on lao .",
    "this fact confirms that the easy magnetization axis of the fm phase is directed in the @xmath11-plane , as already reported in literature@xcite . on the contrary , the difference spectra at @xmath29  t ( when the fm phase is suppressed ) have the same behavior as for the films on the lao substrate ( and on the ngo substrate too ,",
    "not shown here ) . as a consequence , in lsmo films grown on sto and ngo the c - type af phase",
    "is stabilized regardless of the small in - plane tensile strain , which would rather be expected to favor the a - type af phase @xcite .",
    "therefore , in thin films grown on sto and ngo the fm easy axis lays in the @xmath11-plane whereas the af easy axis is along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the schematic drawings of the different easy axes directions are reported at the top of fig .",
    "+     peak height signals , are reported in the inset.,width=8 ]     + further insight in the magnetic properties of very thin manganite layers can be obtained from xmcd measurements . the spin and orbital magnetic moments per atom , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , can in principle be quantified by applying the sum rules@xcite . according to them , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are directly related to the dichroic difference intensities a and b ( fig.2a and 3a ) , which are the @xmath18 and @xmath19 areas , respectively , of the xmcd spectra :    @xmath35    and @xmath36    where c is the xas energy integral over the @xmath0 edges .",
    "however , the quantitative analysis with the sum rules is demonstrated to fail in case of mn atoms @xcite , because of the mixing of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 core levels and of the contribution of the magnetic dipole term . in fig .",
    "7 we report the ratio of the orbital to spin moment ( @xmath34/@xmath33 ) as a function of the strain to qualitatively compare the investigated samples .",
    "it is also important to underline that the a and b values extracted from the xmcd data strongly depend on the energy range chosen for the integration of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 edges .",
    "therefore , the determination of the orbital and spin moments is affected by a large uncertainty and can be carried out with the limited purpose of a comparison among homogenous measurements . in the inset of fig .",
    "7 the shape of the xmcd spectra is shown as a whole to highlight the different behaviors of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 edges .",
    "it follows that @xmath33 decreases with the degradation of the magneto - transport properties , in agrement with a decrease of the fm phase content , while @xmath34 is zero within our experimental error in all the samples except the 30 u.c .",
    "thick film on lao .",
    "our xmld and xmcd results can be explained in terms of the 3d orbital occupation and the coupling among lattice distortions and atomic moments . while xmcd technique was employed to detect the fm spin content , the complementary xmld technique was used to investigate the anisotropy of the fm and af phases . + by xmcd measurements , we observed a significant fm contribution also in the insulating 30 u.c .",
    "thick lsmo film on lao , while such contribution was not detected by xmld measurements .",
    "this finding can be an indication of the in - plane orientation of the fmi phase , thus being orthogonal to the out - of - plane - oriented fm metallic phase in lsmo films grown on lao .",
    "indeed , if the fmi and fm metallic phase are of similar amount they cancel out , as in the case of the 30 u.c .",
    "thick film . on the contrary , in the 100 u.c .",
    "sample the fm metallic dominates and a large difference between the b=0 and b=1 t spectra can be observed in xmld of fig.6 .",
    "using xmld we found ( see fig .",
    "6 ) that at the interfaces the af c - type phase is nucleated by the stabilization of the @xmath13 orbital due to the break of the symmetry along the c - axis .",
    "this also leads to preferential spin orientation out of the @xmath11 plane in the af phase , irrespective of the strain induced by the substrate . on the contrary in the fm regions we found a preferential orbital occupation within the @xmath11-plane for tensile strain ( sto substrate ) and out of the @xmath11-plane for compressive strain ( lao ) .",
    "as already reported in literature@xcite , these results can be explained in terms of the positive magnetostriction which induces the fm easy - axis along the tensile strain direction .",
    "we can rule out the shape anisotropy contribution in agreement with previous reports@xcite , because in our films the fm easy - axis in - plane orientation is not strictly dependent on the thickness of the film .",
    "+ moreover the evolution of @xmath34/@xmath33 measured by xmcd reported in fig.7 demonstrates the lattice distortion effect on the orbital moment .",
    "it can also be explained in the framework of coexisting clusters of af and fm phases , plus a minority contribution from a fmi phase .",
    "in fact for cubic crystal field the orbital moment is expected , from elementary considerations , to be totally quenched @xcite .",
    "that is what happens when fm phase is predominant : the crystal field tetragonal distortion is much smaller than the intrinsic width of the mn states projected onto the o 2p band@xcite and the orbital moment in the fm phase remains negligible despite local distortions arising from strain . when the thickness is reduced and the strain becomes more and more important the af fraction increases and the total spin moment detected by xmcd decreases , because xmcd is insensitive to af moments . when the af phase dominates ( 30 u.c .",
    "on lao ) , a significant elongation of the octahedra along the @xmath37-direction takes place also in the fm phase , the @xmath7 orbitals get preferentially occupied and the orbital moment quenching is partially lifted @xcite because of the relevant contribution of the fmi phase .",
    "the non quenched @xmath34 value can also be explained in terms of the @xmath5 occupancy decrease , as in the case of @xmath30 increasing of the interfacial fmi phase and the @xmath5 -band width narrowing @xcite .",
    "the last being also related to the lattice distortions and the more ionic character of the fmi phase .",
    "all these effects cooperatively contribute to deviate the orbital moment from the quenching in the thinnest lsmo film on lao .",
    "+ finally we note that the af and fm phases have rather independent magnetic anisotropy . from one side , the non quenched in - plane @xmath34 value",
    "is related to the fmi in - plane easy magnetic axis orientation . on the other side , in the fm metallic phase the magnetization orientation",
    "is determined by the strain induced magnetostriction . on the contrary , in the af",
    "phase the preferential orbital occupation always leads to an out - of - plane spin orientation , irrespective of the strain conditions ( fig .",
    "therefore , in the phase separated state the exchange bias between the af and fm regions can be considered negligible and the spin alignment decoupled in the case of lsmo films on sto .",
    "however , we can guess that the fm / af exchange - bias coupling is very small also in the case of lao , because the fmi phase is supposed to be in - plane oriented , thus orthogonal to both the metallic fm and the af phases .",
    "in addition , despite the same spin orientation of the af and the metallic fm phases and the higher coercitive fields , the presence of a relevant exchange bias should have induced an fm hysteresis loop shift .",
    "we have experimentally determined the microscopic origin of magnetic anisotropy in phase separated lsmo thin films .",
    "the interfacial @xmath7 orbital occupation favors the the c - type af spin ordering .",
    "thus , the easy - axis of the af phase is preferentially oriented perpendicularly to the @xmath11-plane for all the substrates , whatever the sign and the strength of the mismatch . on the contrary , in the fm phase the in - plane orbital magnetic moment is partially unquenched when the fmi content becomes relevant . in this case , the tetragonal distortion and the @xmath5 -band width narrowing relax the quenching of the orbital moment , giving rise to an effective spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this demonstrates that , in the magnetic coexisting phases , the spin - orbit to lattice coupling properties are different and magnetic anisotropy is quite independent .",
