    "the projectile - electron excitation and loss occurring in collisions of projectile - ions with atomic targets at non - relativistic impact energies have been extensively studied for long time ( for reviews see @xcite ) . starting with pioneering articles of bates and griffing @xcite the most of the theoretical studies of these processes",
    "have been based on the first order perturbation theory in the projectile - target interaction .    during the last two decades",
    "there has been accumulated a very substantial amount of experimental data on the electron loss from highly charged ionic projectiles moving with relativistic velocities and colliding with solid and gaseous targets . in particular , various projectiles with atomic numbers belonging to the interval @xmath0-@xmath1",
    "were used in the experiments .",
    "the experiments have also covered the very broad interval of the projectile impact energies ranging from rather low relativistic values ( @xmath2-@xmath3 gev / u , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) to extreme relativistic ones ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 gev / u @xcite-@xcite ) where the velocity @xmath6 of the projectile differs just fractionally from the speed of light @xmath7 in vacuum ( @xmath8 a.u . ) . besides , a very substantial progress has been also reached in the theoretical descriptions of the projectile - electron transitions occurring in relativistic ion - atom collisions @xcite-@xcite .    if an ion initially carries several electrons , then more than one electron of the ion can be simultaneously emitted and/or excited in a collision with a neutral atom .",
    "the explorations of relativistic collisions involving simultaneous transitions of two and more projectile electrons had began about twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "however , careful theoretical studies of such collisions have not yet been performed .",
    "indeed , the theoretical research on this topic has , to our knowledge , been restricted to a combination of the independent electron model with the ( simplified ) first order theory to calculate the probabilities for single - electron transitions ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . however , in collisions with heavy atoms the field exerted by the atoms on the electrons of the projectile may be so strong that attempts to apply the first order approximation fail dramatically even for one - electron processes yielding results which exceed experimental cross sections up to by an order of magnitude @xcite .    in @xcite the simultaneous excitation and loss of the projectile electrons was investigated experimentally for @xmath9 mev / u u@xmath10 ions , which are initially in the ground state , impinging on rarefied gas targets of argon , krypton and xenon . in the collision between the projectile - ion and the target - atom one of the two electrons of u@xmath10",
    "was ejected and the other was simultaneously excited into the @xmath11-shell states of u@xmath12 .",
    "such a process represents one of the simplest and basic processes which can occur with projectiles having initially more than one electron .",
    "in addition to experimental data the paper @xcite also contains theoretical results .",
    "however , a satisfactory agreement between these results and the experimental data was reached only for collisions with argon while in collisions with xenon the differences between the theory and experiment already reached a factor of @xmath13-@xmath14 .",
    "the present article is an attempt to improve a theoretical description of the simultaneous loss - excitation of the projectile electrons in relativistic collisions between very heavy helium - like ions and atoms with large atomic numbers .",
    "this attempt is based on the application of relativistic distorted - wave models to calculate the single - electron transition probabilities .",
    "atomic units are used throughout except where otherwise stated .",
    "collisions between an helium - like ion and a multi - electron or many - electron atom are an important and interesting case of the quantum many - body problem . at present",
    "a rigorous and comprehensive treatment of such collisions is out of reach . in this paper , in order to treat the process of the electron loss from a very heavy helium - like ion in a collision with a many - electron atom in which the corresponding hydrogen - like ion is produced in an excited state , we shall use a simplified picture of the collision consisting of the following main steps .",
    "first , the electrons of the ion are regarded as the only particles having dynamical degrees of freedom which are described by a quantum treatment .",
    "second , the nuclei of the ion and of the atom are treated as classical particles which move along given ( straight - line ) trajectories and represent just the sources of the external electromagnetic field acting on the electrons of the ion .",
    "third , at not very high collision energies the excitation and loss of the @xmath15-shell electrons of very heavy ions occur at so small impact parameters that the electrons of the atom can not effectively screen the nucleus of the atom .",
    "this is the case already for single - electron transitions ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . since compared to collisions resulting in single - electron transitions collisions inducing double electron transitions are characterized by even smaller impact parameters , the influence of the atomic electrons on the simultaneous loss - excitation can safely be neglected .",
    "there are essentially two qualitatively different possibilities to get the simultaneous two - electron transitions .",
    "the first is that the atom in the collision effectively interacts with only one electron inducing its transition while the other electron undergoes a transition due to the electron - electron - correlations in the ion and/or due to rearrangement in the final state of the ion .",
    "these processes are called the two - step-1 and shake - off , respectively ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the other possibility is that the field of the atom has enough power to interact simultaneously with each of the two electrons and to become the main driving force for both electrons to undergo transitions . in case",
    "when the interaction with the atomic nucleus involves the exchange of only two virtual photons ( one per electron ) such a process is often referred to as the two - step-2 process ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , provided the condition @xmath16 is fulfilled ( where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the charges of the ionic and atomic nuclei , respectively , and @xmath6 the collision velocity ) , two - electron transitions in a heavy helium - like ion occurring in collisions with an atom are governed mainly by the independent interactions between the nucleus of the atom and each of the electrons of the ion .",
    "this condition , in particular , was very well fulfilled in the experiment @xcite . it will be also fulfilled for the collision systems considered in this article .",
    "when the electron transitions are governed by the independent interactions the application of the independent electron model often yields reasonable results . according to this model the cross section for the simultaneous loss - excitation",
    "is evaluated as @xmath19 where the probability @xmath20 for the two - electron process is given by @xmath21 here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the single - electron excitation and loss probabilities , respectively , in a collision with a given value of the impact parameter @xmath24 .",
    "thus , within the simplified picture of the ion - atom collision , the theoretical treatment of the process of the simultaneous loss and excitation has been reduced to finding the electron transition probabilities within the three - body problem in which a relativistic electron is moving in external electromagnetic fields generated by the nuclei of the ion and atom .",
    "the latter ones are regarded as point - like particles moving along given classical trajectories .",
    "the basic assumption underlying our approach to obtain the probabilities for single - electron transitions is that the motion of the electron in its initial and final states is determined mainly by its interaction with the field of the ionic nucleus .",
    "this interaction , therefore , should be treated as accurate as possible whereas the interaction of the electron with the nucleus of the atom is supposed to be less important and , hence , can be taken into account in an approximate way . for calculations of the excitation and loss probabilities",
    "such an asymmetric approach seems to be certainly reasonable as long as the charge @xmath17 of the ionic nucleus substantially exceeds the charge @xmath18 of the atomic nucleus and the collision velocity is not too low .",
    "it is convenient to treat the electron transition using a reference frame @xmath15 in which the nucleus of the ion is at rest .",
    "we take the position of this nucleus as the origin and assume that in the frame @xmath15 the nucleus of the atom moves along a straight - line classical trajectory @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the impact parameter , @xmath27 is the collision velocity and @xmath28 is the time .",
    "the dirac equation for the electron of the ion reads @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the electronic hamiltonian for the undistorted ion and @xmath31 is the interaction between the electron of the ion and the nucleus of the atom , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the scalar and vector potentials of the electromagnetic field generated by the atomic nucleus in the frame @xmath15 . in the above equations @xmath34 is the electron momentum operator , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the dirac matrices ,",
    "@xmath17 is the charge of the nucleus of the ion and @xmath37 are the electron coordinates with respect to this nucleus .",
    "the potentials @xmath32 and @xmath38 of the moving atomic nucleus will be taken in the lienard - wiechert form ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath39 where @xmath18 is the charge of the nucleus of the atom , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the collisional lorentz factor ,    the prior form of the semi - classical transition amplitude is given by @xmath42 in ( [ e4 ] ) @xmath43 is the solution of the full dirac equation ( [ e1 ] ) and @xmath44 is the solution of @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a distortion potential .",
    "the initial condition reads @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the ( undistorted ) initial state of the electron of the ion with an energy @xmath49 .",
    "in what follows it will be much more convenient to obtain first the transition amplitude in the momentum space , @xmath50 , which is related to the amplitude ( [ e4 ] ) by the two - dimensional fourier transformation @xmath51 and then to use the inverse transformation , @xmath52 in order to get the transition amplitude in the impact parameter space .",
    "the first order transition amplitude is obtained by replacing the states @xmath44 and @xmath43 by the undistorted initial , @xmath53 , and final , @xmath54 , states of the electron in the ion : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the energy of the electron in the final state of the ion . using ( [ e3 ] ) , ( [ lien - wiech ] ) ,",
    "( [ e4 ] ) , ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ 1order-1 ] ) , the first order amplitude in the momentum space is obtained to be @xmath57 where the momentum @xmath58 , which is transferred to the electron of the ion in the collision , is given by @xmath59 and @xmath60      in an attempt to obtain a better description of the interaction between the electron of the ion and the nucleus of the atom we now approximate the initial and final states in ( [ e4 ] ) by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , where @xmath63 with @xmath64 . the semiclassical transition amplitude is then given by @xmath65 where the action of the distortion interaction @xmath66 on the initial state is defined according to @xmath67 using eqs.([sea-1])-([sea-3 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) it can be shown @xcite that the symmetric eikonal amplitude in the momentum space reads @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the gamma and hypergeometric functions , respectively ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that , provided @xmath53 and @xmath54 are exact states of the undistorted hamiltonian of the ion given by eq.([e2 ] ) , in the limit of weak perturbation @xmath71 , the amplitude ( [ sea-4 ] ) goes over into the first order amplitude ( [ 1order-2 ] ) .    with the help of eq.([e7 ] )",
    "the amplitude ( [ sea-4 ] ) is converted into the impact parameter space and the corresponding eikonal amplitude @xmath72 will be used to calculate the probability @xmath22 for single - electron excitation .      within the symmetric eikonal approximation , in order to reflect the influence of the nucleus of the atom on the electron , its initial and final states",
    "are distorted similarly .",
    "this might be a suitable choice if both initial and final electron states are bound states .",
    "when the final electron state is a continuum state a more sophisticated distortion factor is in general necessary .",
    "therefore , in an attempt to obtain a better ( compared to the first order theory ) description of the electron continuum states , we now approximate the initial and final states in ( [ e4 ] ) in the spirit of the continuum - distorted - wave - eikonal - initial - state ( cdw - eis ) approach @xcite , @xcite by @xmath73 here , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the electron velocity with respect to the nucleus of the atom as given in the rest frame of this nucleus , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) is the kinetic momentum of the electron in the rest frame of the atomic nucleus and @xmath78 is the confluent hypergeometric function ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    using eqs.([e4 ] ) , ( [ e6 ] ) , ( [ sea-3 ] ) and ( [ cdw-1 ] ) we obtain that the cdw - eis transition amplitude in the momentum space is given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 note that in the limit of weak perturbation , @xmath71 and @xmath83 , the amplitude ( [ cdw-2 ] ) coincides with the first order amplitude ( [ 1order-2 ] ) provided @xmath53 and @xmath54 are exact states of the undistorted hamiltonian of the ion @xmath84 .    using eqs.([cdw-2])-([cdw-5 ] ) and",
    "( [ e7 ] ) we can calculate numerically the corresponding cdw - eis amplitude @xmath85 in the impact parameter space and evaluate the total probability @xmath23 for single - electron loss .",
    "u@xmath10(1s@xmath86 ) @xmath87 @xmath88 u@xmath12(n=2 , j ) + e@xmath89 + ... , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the angular momentum of the @xmath11-shell states of the hydrogen - like uranium ion .",
    "the cross sections are given as a function of the atomic number @xmath18 of the target atom .",
    "circles and squares with the corresponding error bars are experimental data for the @xmath91 and @xmath90 cases , respectively , reported in @xcite for collisions with argon , krypton and xenon gas targets .",
    "dot ( @xmath90 ) and dash - dot ( @xmath91 ) curves show the cross sections calculated with the single - electron transition probabilities obtained in the first order of perturbation theory in the interaction between the electron and the nucleus of the atom .",
    "solid ( @xmath90 ) and dash ( @xmath91 ) curves display theoretical results obtained using the symmetric eikonal approximation to estimate the excitation probability and the cdw - eis approximation to calculate the loss probability .",
    ", scaledwidth=77.0% ]    in figure [ exc - ion ] we show experimental data for the cross sections for the simultaneous loss - excitation of the projectile electrons .",
    "these cross sections were measured in @xcite for collisions of @xmath92 mev / u",
    "u@xmath93 with gas targets of argon , krypton and xenon for the cases when the internal states of the hydrogen - like projectile ion formed in these collision were characterized by the principal quantum number @xmath94 and the total angular momentum @xmath90 or @xmath91 . figure [ exc - ion ] also contains our theoretical results .",
    "as was already mentioned , at this relatively low impact energy the screening effect of the atomic electrons has a negligible impact on the loss - excitation process . besides , since the effective energy threshold for the antiscreening target mode in this process is about @xmath95 mev / u , the antiscreening effect of the atomic electrons in the collisions under consideration is also very weak .",
    "thus , the presence of the atomic electrons can indeed be ignored , the single - electron transition probabilities can be obtained within the scope of an effectively three - body problem and we may apply the three - body approximations discussed in the previous section .",
    "two sets of theoretical results are presented in figure [ exc - ion ] .",
    "one of them was obtained using the first order perturbation theory to calculate the single - electron excitation and loss probabilities . in the other approach",
    "the excitation probability @xmath22 was evaluated using the symmetric eikonal approximation and the loss probability @xmath23 was calculated in the cdw - eis approximation . in both the first order and distorted - wave calculations the states @xmath53 and @xmath54 were approximated by relativistic bound and continuum states of a hydrogen - like ion with a nuclear charge @xmath96 .",
    "it is seen in figure [ exc - ion ] that in collisions with atomic targets having not very large atomic numbers , for which one has @xmath97 , the two theoretical approaches yield very close cross section values .",
    "when the ratio @xmath98 increases , the differences between the results of the first order approximation and the distorted - wave calculations rapidly grow .",
    "a comparison with the experimental data clearly shows a strong failure of the first order calculations . according to the latter ones the cross section for the two - electron transitions should depend on the target atomic number @xmath18 as @xmath99",
    "however , the experimental points indicate that there are substantial deviations from the @xmath100-dependence which increase with increasing @xmath18 . for instance",
    ", for collisions with xenon the first order results overestimates the experimental data already by a factor of @xmath101 ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath91 ) .    compared to the first order calculations , the calculations employing the distorted wave models predict a much slower increase in the cross sections when the atomic number of the target becomes sufficiently large .",
    "besides , the magnitude of the deviations between the results , obtained with the first order and the distorted wave calculations , depends on which excited states ( @xmath90 or @xmath91 ) are occupied by the remaining electron and are accumulating at a different pace for different final electron states .",
    "comparing the experimental data with the results of the distorted wave calculations we see that these calculations turned out to be much more successful than the first order ones . nevertheless , a certain disagreement between the experiment and theory remains also in the case of the distorted wave calculations .",
    "the latter is also seen in figure [ ratio ] where we compare results for the ratio @xmath102 .",
    "here , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the cross sections for the loss - excitation processes in which the electron remaining bound has been excited into the states with @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "we have calculated the total cross sections for the simultaneous loss and excitation of the projectile electrons in collisions of @xmath92 mev / u helium - like uranium ions with various atomic targets with atomic numbers ranging between @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in these collisions",
    "the effect of the atomic electrons on the simultaneous loss - excitation is weak and can be neglected . at the same time , in such collisions the ratio @xmath109 can reach values which are not much less than @xmath110 meaning that the field of the atomic nucleus acting on the electrons of the ion in these collisions can effectively be quite strong .",
    "two different theoretical approaches were used in our study .",
    "both of them are based on the independent electron approximation . within the framework of the latter the treatment of the process of the simultaneous loss - excitation",
    "is essentially reduced to two steps : i ) obtaining the transition probabilities as a function of the impact parameter and ii ) making use of these probabilities to calculate the cross sections .    within the first approach the single - electron probabilities for the loss and excitation were evaluated in the first order approximation in the interaction between the electron of the projectile and the nucleus of the target . in the treatment of the simultaneous loss - excitation occurring in collisions with rather heavy atoms this approach was shown to strongly fail .    within the second approach the probability for the single - electron excitation was calculated in the symmetric eikonal approximation and the probability for the electron loss",
    "was evaluated using the continuum - distorted - wave - eikonal - initial - state model .",
    "compared to the first order approximation , the distorted - wave treatments have enabled us to reach very substantial improvements in the description of the experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , slight disagreements between the theory and experiment are still remaining which indicates that additional theoretical ( and perhaps experimental ) work is necessary .",
