    "debris disk systems provide a look at an intermediate stage of stellar system evolution .",
    "they represent the transition between the early formation of stars and planets in a primordial protoplanetary disk as seen toward pre - main sequence stars , and the mature stage of an evolved system , like our solar system , which is clear of all primordial material and retains only a hint of secondary products ( e.g. , zodiacal dust ) , the final remnants of the stellar and planetary formation process .",
    "although a debris disk has lost most of its primordial material , the observed infrared luminosity of circumstellar dust , caused by collisions of planetismals and other small bodies , is typically several orders of magnitude larger than estimated for the kuiper and asteroid belts in our solar system @xcite .",
    "ever since the detection of dusty circumstellar material around main sequence stars via infrared excesses @xcite , researchers have been looking for circumstellar gas phase absorption @xcite . of the initial major infrared excess main sequence stars ,",
    "only @xmath0 pic showed gas phase absorption in optical absorption lines ( e.g. , and ) , due to its disk morphology and edge - on orientation @xcite .",
    "such on orientation provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure both the dust and gas components of a debris disk , at an interesting transition near the end of stellar and planetary formation .",
    "only a few other edge - on debris disks have been found since , including @xmath0 car @xcite , hd85905 @xcite , hr10 @xcite , and au mic ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "observed @xmath0 car , hd85905 , hr10 with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ and did not find strong infrared excesses toward any of them , although an optical monitoring campaign showed clear signs of gas variability , as noted by researchers earlier .",
    "however , the magnitude of circumstellar absorption in these systems is lower than observed toward @xmath0 pic .",
    "long monitoring campaigns of @xmath0  pic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , find significant short - term absorption variability .",
    "this variability can be explained by gas clouds very close to the star , which are caused by evaporating , star - grazing , km - sized objects , simply referred to as , falling evaporating bodies ( feb s ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a strong `` stable '' component , at rest in the stellar reference frame , is also detected toward @xmath0  pic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of gas in this component , contrary to the variable component located very close to the star , is dispersed throughout the extended dust disk @xcite .",
    "a `` stable '' absorption component in a gas phase resonance line can be caused by either intervening circumstellar or interstellar gas .",
    "measuring the interstellar medium ( ism ) along the line of sight and in the locality surrounding a circumstellar disk candidate , is critical to characterizing any `` contaminating '' ism absorption @xcite . in particular",
    ", the sun resides in a large scale ism structure known as the local bubble , whose boundary at @xmath4100pc is defined by a significant quantity of interstellar material @xcite .",
    "if a `` stable '' absorption component is observed at the stellar radial velocity , and similar absorption is not detected toward any proximate stars , it is likely that the absorption component is caused by circumstellar material .    using near - infrared scattered light observations taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ , @xcite discovered that the debris disk surrounding hd32297 has an edge - on orientation .",
    "disk emission extends out to @xmath4400au in their observations , while radii @xmath633.6au are occulted by the coronagraphic obstacle .",
    "optical scattered light observations by @xcite confirmed this orientation and extended the range of disk emission to @xmath41680au",
    ". the edge - on orientation of hd32297 makes it an ideal target for gas phase absorption measurements .",
    "observations of the d doublet ( 5895.9242 and 5889.9510 ) toward hd32297 were made over several epochs .",
    "the doublet is among the strongest transitions in the optical wavelength band , appropriate for observing interstellar @xcite and circumstellar @xcite absorption toward nearby stars .",
    "in addition , several stars in close angular proximity to hd32297 were observed , in order to reconstruct the ism absorption profile along the line of sight .",
    "stellar parameters of the observed targets are given in table  [ tab : basics ] , and the observational parameters are listed in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "high resolution optical spectra were obtained using the coud spectrometer on the 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the spectra were obtained at a resolution of @xmath7240,000 , using the 2dcoud spectrograph @xcite in the cs21 configuration .",
    "the data were reduced using image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ; * ? ? ? * ) and interactive data language ( idl ) routines to subtract the bias , flat field the images , remove scattered light and cosmic ray contamination , extract the echelle orders , calibrate the wavelength solution , and convert to heliocentric velocities .",
    "wavelength calibration images were taken using a th - ar hollow cathode before and after each target .",
    "numerous weak water vapor lines are commonly present in spectra around the doublet , and must be modeled and removed , in order to measure an accurate interstellar ( or circumstellar ) absorption profile .",
    "i use a forward modeling technique demonstrated by @xcite to remove telluric line contamination in the vicinity of the d lines , with a terrestrial atmosphere model ( at - atmospheric transmission program , from airhead software , boulder , co ) developed by erich grossman . with two absorption lines , it is straightforward to identify contaminating telluric absorption .",
    "all absorption lines were fit using standard methods ( e.g. ,  2.2 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "gaussian absorption components are fit to both d lines simultaneously using atomic data from @xcite , and then convolved with the instrumental line spread function . fitting the lines",
    "simultaneously reduces the influence of systematic errors , such as continuum placement and contamination by weak telluric features .",
    "the free parameters are the central velocity ( @xmath8 ) , the line width or doppler parameter ( @xmath9 ) , and the column density ( @xmath10 ) of ions along the line of sight .",
    "the fits are shown in figure  [ fig : hd32297_figna1 ] and fit parameters with 1@xmath11 statistical errors are listed in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "in addition , the spectra were used to estimate the stellar radial velocity ( @xmath12 ) and projected stellar rotation ( @xmath13 ) for hd32297 , bd+07 777s , and bd+07 778 ( see table  [ tab : basics ] ) , quantities not listed in simbad for these targets .",
    "the radial velocities of all 3 objects differ significantly , and therefore it is unlikely that they are physically associated .",
    "note that the radial velocity of hd32297 ( @xmath14 km  s@xmath15 ) is measured from broad and h@xmath16 stellar absorption lines , and therefore is not tightly constrained .",
    "the left column of figure  [ fig : hd32297_figna1 ] shows that absorption is clearly detected toward hd32297 in 5 observations over 5 months .",
    "two components are easily distinguished , a strong component at @xmath424.5 km  s@xmath15 and a weaker component at @xmath420.5 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "the spectral region for 5 stars in close angular proximity to hd32297 is also shown in figure  [ fig : hd32297_figna1 ] . only a single ism component , at @xmath424.2 km  s@xmath15 , is detected in the 3 distant neighbors , indicating that large scale interstellar material is located at a distance between 59.4112pc .",
    "all targets located beyond this material , including hd32297 , should have a similar ism absorption feature .",
    "this strong ism absorption is probably associated with the boundary material of the local bubble , which is estimated to be @xmath490 pc in this direction @xcite .",
    "if located at this distance , the physical separation of the interstellar material observed toward hd32297 and the material toward bd+07 777s ( @xmath17 0@xmath19 ) is 0.025pc , bd+07 778 ( 2@xmath14 ) is 0.064pc , and 18 ori ( 5@xmath181 ) is 8.1pc . toward hd32297",
    "s two closest neighbors , the ism absorption is almost identical in projected velocity and column density to the strong absorption seen toward hd32297 , while toward 18 ori , the absorption differs slightly in both @xmath8 and @xmath10 , indicating that any small scale morphological variations in the local bubble shell are on scales @xmath20.1pc but @xmath68pc .",
    "small scale variations in the local bubble shell have been detected by @xcite on scales @xmath40.5pc .",
    "it is unlikely that the unique 20.5 km  s@xmath15 feature observed toward hd32297 is caused by a small scale interstellar structure . although small ism structures ( 0.012.0pc ) have been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is more likely that the unique feature is due to absorption in the circumstellar environment surrounding hd32297 because ( 1 ) hd32297 is known to be an edge - on debris disk , ( 2 ) no similar absorption is detected in the very close neighboring sightlines ( 0.030.08pc ) , and ( 3 ) the absorption matches the stellar radial velocity .",
    "temporal variability is also a hallmark of circumstellar material ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . to search for variability , figure  [ fig : hd32297_diff ]",
    "shows difference spectra of all observations .",
    "some indication of temporal variability on time scales of months is detected .",
    "for example , between the 2005 sep and 2006 feb observations , the @xmath420.5 km  s@xmath15 feature became stronger and the separation between the circumstellar and interstellar features became less distinct , despite the fact that the 2006 feb observations were made at a slightly higher resolving power .",
    "the redshifted variability seen between 2005 sep and 2006 feb is @xmath45@xmath11 above the standard deviation .",
    "the same pattern is seen in both lines , indicating that the telluric contamination is not causing the variation .",
    "slight changes in the resolving power of our instrument could mimic this variable behavior , differentially moving light from the cores of the line to the wings ( or vice versa ) .",
    "however , resolution variability should cause ( 1 ) symmetric features in the wings of the line whereas we see a feature only to the blue of the ism feature and not to the red , and ( 2 ) should have a stronger effect on stronger absorption features , whereas the feature is roughly identical in both lines , which could be caused if the absorbing material covers only a fraction of the stellar disk , as has been seen toward @xmath0 pic @xcite .",
    "this data alone provides only a subtle indication of temporal variation in , partially because any significant absorption toward the red , is masked by the strong ism feature .",
    "redshifted circumstellar absorption dominates the gas absorption variability toward @xmath0 pic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while no temporal variability has ever been detected in toward @xmath0 pic , only the `` stable '' absorption component is seen in this ion @xcite .",
    "circumstellar variability in has been detected in other edge - on debris disks , e.g. , @xmath0 car , hd85905 , and hr10 @xcite . any redshifted absorption occuring in this object could cause fluctuations in the measured column density of the `` constant '' ism feature .",
    "little evidence for variability is found toward the blue .",
    "these observations indicate that hd32297 has the strongest circumstellar disk signature detected around a nearby main sequence debris disk star .",
    "even compared to @xmath0 pic , the prototypical edge - on debris disk with absorption column densities of @xmath19@xmath20 @xcite , the gas disk around hd32297 , with @xmath3 , has 5@xmath21 the column density .",
    "a crude estimate of the gas mass surrounding hd32297 can be made if it is assumed to have the same morphology and abundances as the stable gas around @xmath0 pic . although the observations of hd32297 indicate some red - shifted temporal variability , much of the gas is stable over all observations .",
    "using @xmath0 pic as a proxy , the variable gas is likely located very close to the star @xcite , while the stable gas at rest in the stellar frame , likely traces the bulk dust disk @xcite . for this calculation ,",
    "i assume all the gas is in the stable component , and therefore this gas mass estimate should be considered an upper limit .",
    "the morphology of the disk is assumed to follow a broken power law density profile , as fit to the emission profile of the @xmath0 pic disk ( see equation  1 of @xcite ) , and assumed to extend out to the edge of the debris disk at @xmath41680au @xcite .",
    "the abundances in the hd32297 disk are assumed to be similar to @xmath0 pic @xcite , where the ratio @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 , is based on @xmath0 pic measurements by @xcite and limits by @xcite . given these assumption , i calculate a gas mass , distributed through the bulk debris disk surrounding hd32297 at @xmath25 .",
    "future observations are planned to continue monitoring the temporal variability of the circumstellar gas toward hd32297 to determine the ratio of stable to variable gas , and measure the gas disk absorption , in order to independently measure the to ratio .",
    "a more definitive detection of temporal variability may require monitoring excited lines which will show circumstellar absorption , but not the strong interstellar feature .",
    "i present the first high resolution optical spectra of the doublet toward the debris disk hd32297 and stars in close angular proximity .",
    "a summary of results include :    \\(1 ) two absorption components are detected toward hd32297 , while only one is detected toward its proximate neighbors located at a comparable distance .",
    "the extra absorption component in the spectrum of hd32297 , which is also at rest in the stellar reference frame , is therefore likely caused by circumstellar material .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the ism absorption is similar among hd32297 and its two closest neighbors , and is likely due to absorption from the shell that defines the boundary of the local bubble .",
    "some variation in local bubble absorption is detected toward 18 ori .",
    "+ ( 3 ) radial velocities of hd32297 , bd+07 777s , and bd+07 778 are measured and differ significantly , indicating that they are likely not physically associated .",
    "+ ( 4 ) some indication of temporal variability is detected over several epochs of observations .",
    "instrumental resolution variations and masking by the strong ism absorption , make a definitive detection of circumstellar variability difficult . + ( 5 ) the measured circumstellar feature toward hd32297 ( @xmath26 ) is the strongest such absorption measured toward any nearby main sequence debris disk , @xmath45 times greater than the column density of the prototypical edge - on debris disk , @xmath0 pic .",
    "+ ( 6 ) if the morphology and abundances of the stable gas component around hd32297 are assumed to be similar to @xmath0 pic , i estimate an upper limit to the gas mass in the circumstellar disk surrounding hd32297 of @xmath40.3 @xmath5 .",
