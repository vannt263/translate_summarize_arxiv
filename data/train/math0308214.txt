    "in this paper we study the cauchy problem for the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation posed on @xmath5 , @xmath6 where the unknown @xmath7 is a complex valued function on @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denotes the laplace operator associated to the metric @xmath10 on @xmath5 .",
    "it is classical that smooth solutions of ( [ nls ] ) satisfy the following two conservation laws , @xmath11 as a consequence , the sobolev @xmath12 norm of the function @xmath13 on @xmath5 is controlled by the @xmath12 norm of the cauchy data @xmath14 . by combining this observation with energy estimates and a logarithmic gronwall lemma",
    ", brzis - gallouet @xcite proved that , for any @xmath15 , the problem ( [ nls ] ) has a unique solution @xmath16 . +",
    "our purpose is the study of the dynamics of the flow @xmath17 defined by the latter theorem , in connection with the geometry of the surface @xmath5 . indeed , because of the infinite speed of propagation for equation ( [ nls ] ) , it is natural to expect the geometry to play an important role even in the small time dynamics .",
    "moreover , it is likely that the results will be sensitive to the distance on the phase space , which we shall choose to be the @xmath2 distance , a natural choice in view of ( [ cons ] ) and of the properties of the linear schrdinger group .",
    "this leads to the following definition .",
    "let @xmath18 be a real number .",
    "we shall say that the cauchy problem ( [ nls ] ) is uniformly well - posed in @xmath19 if , for any bounded subset @xmath20 of @xmath19 , there exists @xmath21 such that the flow map @xmath22,h^s(m))\\ ] ] is uniformly continuous when the source space is endowed with the @xmath2 norm , and when the target space is endowed with @xmath23    the notion of uniformly well - posed cauchy problem has been recently addressed by several authors in the context of various nonlinear evolution equations ( see _ e.g. _ birnir - kenig - ponce - svanstedt - vega  @xcite , gallagher - grard @xcite , kenig - ponce - vega @xcite , lebeau @xcite , burq - grard - tzvetkov @xcite , christ - colliander - tao @xcite , koch - tzvetkov @xcite ) .",
    "besides the existence of a local continuous flow map on @xmath2 , which corresponds to hadamard s classical notion of wellposedness , this notion can be rephrased as high frequency stability in @xmath2 in the following sense : given two bounded sequences of cauchy data in @xmath2 , whose difference converges to @xmath24 in @xmath2 , the difference between the corresponding sequences of solutions converges to @xmath24 in @xmath2 uniformly on a fixed small time interval .",
    "in other words , if the problem is uniformly well - posed in @xmath2 , the flow acts in small time on defects of compactness of bounded sequences in @xmath2 . on the other hand , the lack of uniform well - podsedness corresponds to some nonlinear instability of the evolution acting on data involving high frequencies .",
    "+ at this stage , it is worth to observe that , as far as we know , the only known examples of uniformly well - posed cauchy problems are based on the convergence of the picard iteration scheme on some convenient banach space of functions , hence are such that the flow map ( [ flow ] ) is in fact lipschitz continuous .",
    "this will be the case for the results in this paper too .",
    "+ let us review the known results about uniform wellposedness for the problem ( [ nls ] ) in the literature , starting with the positive results .",
    "first , in view of the sobolev embedding theorem in two space dimensions , a simple application of energy methods leads to uniform wellposedness in @xmath2 for every @xmath25 on every compact surface @xmath5 . in the case",
    "@xmath26 , notice that results of vladimirov @xcite and ogawa - ozawa @xcite only imply hadamard wellposedness .",
    "more recently , in @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , the authors proved uniform wellposedness in @xmath2 for every @xmath27 . the proof is based on the following strichartz estimates for the linear schrdinger group on @xmath5 , derived in @xcite ( see also staffilani - tataru @xcite ) : for every function @xmath28 on @xmath5 , for every finite time interval @xmath29 , @xmath30 for every pair @xmath31 satisfying @xmath32 indeed , these estimates allow to gain essentially half a derivative with respect to the sobolev embedding , if one agrees to deal with @xmath33 norms rather than with space - time @xmath34 norms , which does not make strong differences in the analysis of ( [ nls ] ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , using a different method , bourgain proved in @xcite , @xcite that , on the torus @xmath35 , uniform wellposedness holds in @xmath2 for every @xmath36 .",
    "this result should be compared to the corresponding one on the euclidean plane , due to cazenave - weissler @xcite , and which is based on strichartz estimates with no loss of derivatives , namely estimates ( [ strichartz ] ) where the norm in the right hand side is the @xmath37 norm instead of the @xmath38 norm .",
    "notice however that bourgain s approach is quite different , since such estimates are not known ( or are known to fail ) on @xmath39 .",
    "+ let us come to the negative results .",
    "the simplest one concerns the torus ( in fact it works as well on the one - dimensional torus ) and states that uniform wellposedness fails in @xmath2 for @xmath40 ( see @xcite and christ - colliander - tao @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , it seems that a suitable adaptation of a recent work of christ - colliander - tao @xcite shows that this result holds on every compact surface .",
    "therefore the remaining range of regularity to be discussed is the interval @xmath41 $ ] ; moreover , on the torus , the picture is complete since uniform wellposedness in @xmath2 is equivalent to positivity of the regularity @xmath18  apart from the critical regularity @xmath42 , a very difficult open problem . + it is interesting to notice that the situation on the standard sphere is quite different .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , strong concentration of some spherical harmonics was used to prove that ( [ nls ] ) is not uniformly well - posed in @xmath43 for @xmath44 ( see also the recent work of banica @xcite , which gives more precise results ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to complete the picture on the sphere .",
    "[ th1 ] if @xmath3 is the standard sphere , or more generally a zoll surface , then the cauchy problem for ( [ nls ] ) is uniformly well - posed in @xmath19 for every @xmath1 .",
    "we recall that a zoll surface is a surface on which the geodesic flow is periodic ( see besse @xcite for a detailed exposition ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the construction on @xmath45 of @xcite can be extended to many others revolution surfaces and thus theorem [ th1 ] provides sharp uniform wellposedness results far a large class of zoll surfaces .",
    "the details of this construction will be given elsewhere ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in the case of the torus and of the sphere , the above results display a critical regularity threshold @xmath46 above which uniform wellposedness holds , and below which uniform wellposedness fails : we have @xmath47 and , in view of theorem 1 , @xmath48 .",
    "we expect that such a threshold exists on every surface .",
    "of course the most interesting open question is to relate the value of this threshold to the geometric properties of the surface .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to know whether there exist surfaces for which this threshold exceeds @xmath49 .",
    "let us describe briefly the main steps in the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "a first step is to reduce , on every compact surface , the uniform wellposedness for ( [ nls ] ) in @xmath2 for every @xmath50 , to the following bilinear inequality on solutions of the linear schrdinger equation , @xmath51\\times m}| { e}^{it\\delta } f\\ , ( x)\\ , { e}^{it\\delta } g\\ , ( x)|^2\\ , dt\\ , dx\\right ) ^{1/2 } \\leq   c\\ , ( \\min ( n , l))^{s_0}\\no f\\no _ { l^2}\\ , \\no g\\no _ { l^2}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 are large dyadic numbers , and @xmath53 are supposed to be spectrally localized on dyadic intervals of order @xmath52 respectively , namely @xmath54 notice that such kind of bilinear estimates were established and used by several authors in the context of the wave equation and of the schrdinger equation with constant coefficients ( see klainerman - machedon - bourgain - tataru @xcite , bourgain @xcite , foschi - klainerman  @xcite , tao @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the general principle of the above reduction is based on the systematic use of conormal spaces introduced by bourgain in @xcite ( see also ginibre @xcite ) .",
    "+ the second step in the proof of theorem 1 is to observe that , due to the good localization of the spectrum of a zoll surface ( see guillemin @xcite , colin de verdire @xcite ) , the above bilinear inequality for @xmath55 reduces on a zoll surface to the following result on the spectral projectors .",
    "[ th2 ] let @xmath3 be a compact surface , and let @xmath56 .",
    "for each @xmath57 , we introduce the operator @xmath58 there exist @xmath59 such that , for all @xmath60 , for all functions @xmath53 on @xmath5 , @xmath61    notice that the case @xmath62 in theorem [ th2 ] is a particular case of general @xmath63 estimates due to sogge ( @xcite ) which take the following form , for every @xmath64 $ ] , @xmath65 where @xmath66 , and more generally @xmath67 is given in terms of @xmath68 by the following diagram :    [ fig : burq ] @xmath69{sogge.eps } } { \\aat{2}{35}{$\\frac 1 2$}\\aat{2}{19}{$\\frac 1 4$}\\aat{2}{14}{$\\frac 1 6$}\\aat{2}{10}{$\\frac 1 8$}\\aat{15}{0}{$\\frac 1 6$}\\aat{20}{0}{$\\frac 1 4$}\\aat{37}{0}{$\\frac 1 2$}\\aat{0}{40}{$s(p)$}\\aat{45}{0}{$\\frac 1 p$}}\\ ] ]    of course the advantage of using estimate ( [ bilsogge ] ) , rather than applying hlder s inequality and ( [ sogge ] ) , is to make the highest frequency disappear from the right hand side , which is crucial in the nonlinear analysis of the first step .",
    "a glance at the particular case of the sphere is particularly enlightening .",
    "indeed , in this case , estimate ( [ bilsogge ] ) means that the @xmath37 norm of the product of two spherical harmonics divided by the product of their @xmath37 norms is bounded by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the minimum of their two degrees .",
    "it is interesting to notice that estimate ( [ bilsogge ] ) ( as well as ( [ sogge ] ) ) is made optimal by choosing the following spherical harmonics , @xmath72 which concentrates onto the large circle @xmath73 of @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , this kind of spherical harmonics already appeared in a paper by stanton and weinstein @xcite which was a motivation for sogge s result @xcite .",
    "inspired by these earlier works , we established the nonlinear instability in @xcite precisely by studying the cauchy problem ( [ nls ] ) with @xmath74",
    ". therefore , in some sense , the behavior of @xmath75 can summarize in itself the whole problem of uniform wellposedness on the sphere .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the same example shows that a bilinear inequality such as ( [ bilsogge ] ) with an @xmath63 norm in the left hand side could not hold if @xmath76 . in this case , the high frequency would necessarily appear in the right hand side .",
    "+ the third and main step in the proof of theorem 1 is of course theorem 2 itself . by a reduction which is now classical ( see @xcite ) , one is led to studying oscillatory integral operators of carleson - sjlin s type ( see carleson - sjlin @xcite , hrmander @xcite ) . at this stage",
    "our proof consists in applying the calculus of fourier integral operators ( see hrmander @xcite ) in order to reduce the problem to a bilinear carleson - sjlin inequality , which we then prove by adapting an idea used by hrmander in @xcite . + this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we precise the relationship between uniform wellposedness and bilinear inequalities ( [ bil ] ) on solutions of the linear schrdinger equation . in section 3 , we take advantage of the localization of the spectrum of a zoll surface in order to deduce theorem 1 from theorem 2 .",
    "finally , section 4 is devoted to the proof of theorem 2 .",
    "we close this introduction by mentioning that the results of this paper were announced in @xcite . +",
    "* acknowledgements .",
    "* we are grateful to terence tao for valuable conversations about bilinear estimates .",
    "in this section @xmath5 is any compact surface .",
    "however the analysis can be easily adapted to more general situations as higher dimensional manifolds , focusing nonlinearities , etc .",
    "we prove that the uniform wellposedness of   on @xmath5 can be deduced from bilinear estimates on the solutions of the linear equation .",
    "this is a result of independent interest that we state below :    [ th3 ] suppose that there exists @xmath59 and @xmath77 such that for any @xmath78 satisfying @xmath79}(u_0)=u_0,\\quad \\11_{\\sqrt{-\\delta}\\in [ l,2l]}(v_0)=v_0\\ ] ] one has ( with @xmath80 ) @xmath81 then the cauchy problem   is uniformly well - posed in @xmath82 for any @xmath50 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ th3 ] relies on the use of bourgain spaces .",
    "we first show that   is equivalent to a bilinear estimate in bourgain spaces .",
    "we then prove the crucial non linear estimate which yields the proof of the uniform wellposedness due to a contraction argument in a suitable bourgain space associated to @xmath2 regularity .",
