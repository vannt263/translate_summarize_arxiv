    "a large number of neutrinos are emitted from a core - collapse supernova .",
    "these neutrinos interact with nuclei through the weak interaction .",
    "although their cross sections are small , it is agreed that their contribution to nucleosynthesis ( that is , r- , @xmath1- and p - processes ) is not negligible due to the large neutrino luminosity @xcite .",
    "neutrinos may even play a leading role in some cases .",
    "for instance , yoshida _ et al .",
    "_ recently argued that the abundance ratio between @xmath2li and @xmath3b is sensitive to the @xmath1-process and thus can be used to extract information on the neutrino mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "also , the abundance ratio between u and th elements , which has been used as a cosmochronometer , may be affected by the @xmath1-process .",
    "it is thus important to calculate with high accuracy the cross section of the neutrino - nucleus reactions in a dense star .    in the supernova nucleosynthesis ,",
    "only the charged current reactions of the electron neutrinos , @xmath4 , and the electron anti - neutrinos , @xmath5 , are relevant , since those of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( and their antineutrinos ) are suppressed due to the threshold effects .",
    "these processes are represented by @xmath8 the average energies of @xmath4 and @xmath9 neutrinos in a core collapse supernova are typically 11 mev and 16 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized , however , that the exact hierarchy of neutrino energies depend on the details of the underlying microphysics @xcite .",
    "the outgoing electron and positron feel the coulomb interaction from the daughter nucleus as they leave . this final state interaction affects the neutrino - nucleus reaction rate @xcite .    in the supernova environment ,",
    "the motion of the outgoing electron is further perturbed by other charged particles in the environment besides the daughter nucleus , such as protons , electrons , @xmath10 particles and other heavier nuclei .",
    "such effects have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for electron capture rates in a dense star .",
    "furthermore , in a high electron density , the reaction ( [ eq:1 ] ) is suppressed because low energy electron states are pauli blocked .",
    "it is crucial to take into account those two effects in order to accurately estimate the neutrino - nucleus reaction rate for nucleosynthesis .    in this paper , we perform such calculations , taking into consideration both the electron screening and pauli blocking effects . for this purpose",
    ", we use the thomas - fermi theory for electron screening , which has often been used in many - body physics .",
    "we then calculate the cross section of a neutrino - nucleus reaction using the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) method , including the screening and the pauli blocking effects simultaneously .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we detail our model for the charged current neutrino - nucleus reaction in a supernova environment , that uses the thomas - fermi theory for electron screening , and the dwba method with the pauli blocking effect . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the results of our calculation for the @xmath11fe(@xmath12co and @xmath13pb(@xmath14bi reactions , and discuss the effects of the electronic environment .",
    "we summarize our paper in sec . iv .",
    "we first discuss the electron screening effect on the final state interaction between the outgoing electron and the daughter nucleus . despite of the charge neutral condition of the environment",
    ", the screening effect can still be significant because the daughter nucleus attracts the environmental electrons and polarizes the background charge distribution .",
    "the positive charge particles are relatively heavy , and thus we neglect its polarization .",
    "we assume that the electron charge distribution is homogeneous with density @xmath15 in the absence of the daughter nucleus .",
    "this charge distribution of the environmental electrons is modified to @xmath16 due to the presence of the daughter nucleus , whose charge distribution is represented by @xmath17 . neglecting the the interaction among the environmental electrons , which is valid at high temperatures ,",
    "the coulomb field @xmath18 at @xmath19 from the daughter nucleus reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the polarization charge . in order to evaluate this function , we assume a sharp - cut charge distribution for @xmath22 , that is , @xmath23\\cdot\\theta(r - r)$ ] with a nuclear radius of @xmath24 . here",
    ", @xmath25 is the atomic number of the daughter nucleus .    for the electron density @xmath26",
    ", we use the thomas - fermi theory .",
    "the polarization charge then reads @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the electron mass , and the local fermi energy @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "we have assumed that atoms are completely ionized , without any bound electrons .",
    "since the electron density @xmath26 depends explicitly on the coulomb field @xmath32 , we evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) self - consistently , assuming the spherical symmetry .",
    "the boundary condition is imposed so that the coulomb potential vanishes at the radius where the net negative charge inside is equal to the charge number of the daughter nucleus .",
    "once the coulomb field @xmath32 is obtained , we solve the dirac equation for the outgoing election with the potential @xmath33 .",

    "the environmental electrons are almost degenerate and the occupation probability of the lowest energy states is close to unity .",

    "we see from the figures that the pauli blocking effects are important below these energies .",
    "we have confirmed that the screening and the blocking effects disappear in the high @xmath45 limit .    for the anti - neutrino induced reactions , ( [ eq:1 - 2 ] ) , the screening effect increases the cross section in contrast to the neutrino induced reactions shown in figs . 1 and 2 , while the pauli blocking effect is irrelevant in the absence of a positron background .",

    "we see that the pauli blocking effect influences the @xmath13pb@xmath72bi reaction much more significantly than the @xmath11fe@xmath71co reaction .",
    "this is due to the fact that the neutrino energy distribution @xmath81 has a peak around @xmath86 8.87 mev at the neutrino temperature considered here . for the former reaction ,",
    "the excitation energy @xmath87 is 15 mev and the energy of the produced electron is always small , for which the blocking effect is important . for the latter reaction ,",

    "we find that the screening effect on the total cross sections is sensitive to the variation of the coulomb potential due to the environmental electrons .",
    "for instance , the depth of the potential between the outgoing electron and @xmath13bi is 25.2 mev in the absence of the environmental electrons . at @xmath88 and 10@xmath89 @xmath68 ,",
    "it is 25.08 , 24.97 , and 24.73 mev , respectively .",
    "the corresponding change of the total cross section is 2.25 , 4.48 , and 10.1% , respectively .",
    "clearly , it is important to estimate carefully the coulomb potential in the high electron density region .",
    "the motion of the outgoing electron in the final state of a charged current neutrino - nucleus reaction is affected by surrounding environmental electrons in a supernova .",
    "we have discussed the electron screening as well as the pauli blocking effects due to the environmental electrons on cross sections of the neutrino - nucleus reaction . for this purpose",
    ", we used the thomas - fermi theory for the screening potential , and the dwba with the pauli blocking factor for the cross sections .",
    "our results for the @xmath13pb@xmath72bi and @xmath11fe@xmath71co reactions show that both the effects hinder the cross sections , especially at high electron densities .",
    "we have also shown that the pauli blocking effect is more significant in the former reaction than in the latter reaction due to the larger excitation energy for the fermi transition .",
    "the screening effect is also larger in the former reaction because of the larger atomic number .    as far as we know ,",
    "the screening and the pauli blocking effects discussed in this paper have not been taken into account in the calculations for r - process nucleosynthesis .",
