    "recently the resonant x - ray scattering spectroscopy has attracted much attention because this experimental method is considered as one of the most powerful tools which can directly observe the orbital order in the strongly correlated systems .",
    "a lot of experiments have already been carried out on the perovskite transition - metal compounds , @xcite v@xmath5o@xmath1@xcite and dyb@xmath5c@xmath5 , @xcite in which the scattering intensities were observed on the orbital superlattice spots , which are forbidden for usual x - ray scattering .",
    "such anomalous x - ray scattering will simply be referred to as rxs . despite much effort so far , how and to what extent the rxs spectra are reflecting the orbital order are still controversial , especially on the perovskite compounds , since the orbital order usually accompanies the jahn  teller distortion ( jtd)@xcite and the gdfeo@xmath1 type distortion , which can also gives rise to the rxs intensity .",
    "the resonant scattering may be described by a second order process that a photon is virtually absorbed by exciting a core electron to unoccupied states and then emitted by recombining the excited electron with the core hole .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath0 edge of the transition - metal compounds , the @xmath4 states are involved in the intermediate states of the dipolar process . for the rxs in the @xmath0 edge of lamno@xmath1 , the so called _ coulomb mechanism _",
    "was proposed that the anisotropic part of the intra - atomic coulomb interaction between the orbitally polarized @xmath2 states and the @xmath4 states is responsible to the rxs intensity by making the degenerate @xmath4 levels split.@xcite however , subsequent studies based on the band structure calculations have revealed that the coulomb effect is much smaller ( @xmath6 ) than the jtd effect on the rxs intensity.@xcite this is because the @xmath4 states are so extended in space that they are sensitive to neighboring o potentials .",
    "the rxs spectra on yvo@xmath1 have been observed for the pre @xmath0 edge and the main @xmath0 edge regions of v.@xcite the spectra consist of several peaks as a function of photon energy , and the shapes are different between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 reflections .",
    "assuming that the scattering tensor is directly related to the orbital polarization of the @xmath2 states , the authors argued that the azimuthal angle dependence of the spectra was consistent with the c - type orbital order@xcite in the low temperature phase .",
    "however , this assumption made there implies the dominance of the coulomb effect , which is questionable .",
    "recently the resonant x - ray scattering experiment has also been carried out on ytio@xmath1 , and the rxs spectra have been observed with their shapes similar to those of yvo@xmath1.@xcite in this paper , concentrating our attention on ytio@xmath1 , we study the mechanism of the rxs spectra by carrying out a band structure calculation on the experimentally determined crystal structure.@xcite    the crystal structure of ytio@xmath1 is known to belong to the space group @xmath9 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ crystal ] ; four ti ions are inequivalent in the unit cell .",
    "the ti - o - ti bond angles strongly deviate from @xmath10 due to the tilt of the tio@xmath3 octahedra,@xcite and ti - o bond lengths are different in tio@xmath3 octahedra due to the jtd .",
    "one of the @xmath11 levels is occupied under the crystal field in the @xmath12 configuration of ti@xmath13 ions , and since the @xmath11 states are weakly hybridizing with o @xmath14 states , the jtd is smaller ( @xmath15 ) than that on lamno@xmath1@xcite .",
    "note that the crystal structure of yvo@xmath1 belongs to the same space group of @xmath9 with similar sizes of the tilt of vo@xmath3 octahedra and the jtd@xcite .",
    "we calculate the rxs spectra using the band calculation based on the local density approximation ( lda ) together with the muffin - tin approximation .",
    "this approximate scheme leads to a metallic ground state for ytio@xmath1 with a very small orbital polarization . in spite of this shortcoming for the @xmath2 bands",
    ", we expect that the @xmath4 bands are well described in the present calculation , since they have energies @xmath16 ev higher than the @xmath2 bands and thereby the details of the @xmath2 bands are irrelevant .",
    "what is important , which will become clear , to make the @xmath4 states different at different ti sites is the o potential of neighboring sites .",
    "the @xmath4 states are so extended in space that they are sensitively modified by hybridizing and interacting with the electronic states of neighboring ions .",
    "actually , for lamno@xmath1 , it is known that the lda@xmath17 method , which predicts an insulating ground state with large orbital polarization , gives the @xmath4 bands and the rxs spectra nearly the same as those given by the lda method , although the latter predicts a small band gap and a small orbital polarization.@xcite    we obtain the rxs spectra with sufficient intensities for ytio@xmath1 .",
    "the obtained spectra as a function of photon energy resemble closely to the results of the experiment for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 reflections of yvo@xmath1,@xcite and also to those of the recent experiment of ytio@xmath1.@xcite since the muffin - tin approximation averages the coulomb interaction between the @xmath4 and the @xmath2 states , the anisotropy of the coulomb interaction is eliminated in the calculation of the rxs spectra . therefore the obtained rxs intensity arises from the distorted crystal structure .",
    "we may roughly estimate that the coulomb effect is less than @xmath18 of the jtd effect , since the coulomb effect is evaluated as 1/100 smaller than the jtd effect in lamno@xmath1.@xcite note that the jtd effect can not be distinguished from that of the tilt of the tio@xmath3 octahedra in the present calculation . such sensitivity of the @xmath4 states to the electronic states at neighboring sites has already been recognized in the analysis of the magnetic circular dichroism of the @xmath0 edge absorption spectra on the ferromagnetic states of transition metals@xcite and the analysis of the resonant x - ray magnetic scattering spectra on coo@xcite and nio.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we briefly discuss the band structure calculation on the ground state . in section 3",
    "we outline the calculation procedure of rxs spectra and discuss the calculated results .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "first we examine the meaning of the atomic @xmath4 states .",
    "figure [ wavefunc ] shows the atomic @xmath4 wave function for a ti@xmath13 ion , calculated within the hartree - fock approximation.@xcite the @xmath4 wave function extends considerably in space so that a large part of the amplitude would lie on the neighboring oxygen sites or the interstitial region in solids .",
    "this situation is not changed in the presence of the core - hole potential , as shown by the broken line in the figure .",
    "thus one may easily understand the sensitiveness of the @xmath4 states to electronic states at neighboring sites .",
    "the concept of the atomic @xmath4 levels loses its clear meaning in solids , and the @xmath4 states are to be treated as energy bands . nevertheless , the @xmath19 symmetric states ( centered at a ti site ) above the fermi energy are referred to the @xmath4 states , since the atomic character is almost preserved inside the atomic sphere in the band structure calculation .    in the band structure calculation for ytio@xmath1",
    ", we use the korringa  kohn ",
    "rostoker ( kkr ) method within the lda scheme .",
    "we assume the crystal structure determined experimentally at room temperature in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ crystal ] . as mentioned before",
    ", the crystal structure belongs to the space group @xmath9;@xcite the unit cell involves four y ions , four ti ions and 12 o ions .",
    "the four ti sites are distinctive in terms of the orientation even though the orbital ordering does not occur .",
    "the large tilt of tio@xmath3 octahedra makes the ti - o - ti bond angles strongly deviates from @xmath10 by as much as @xmath20 .",
    "each tio@xmath3 octahedron also undergoes the jtd such that the direction @xmath21 corresponds to the short bond , the @xmath22 to the long bond , and the @xmath23 to the middle bond , where three arrows @xmath24 attached to each ti ion are directed to neighboring oxygen sites and are almost orthogonal to each other .",
    "there exists an important symmetry that the configuration surrounding the ti 1 site becomes coincident to that surrounding the ti 2 site under the rotation of all positions of atoms by @xmath25 around the line parallel to the @xmath26 axis passing through the ti 1 site . in the same way ,",
    "the configuration surrounding the ti 1 site becomes coincident to those surrounding the ti 3 and the ti 4 sites under the rotation of the atomic position by @xmath25 around the line parallel to the @xmath27 and the @xmath28 axes , respectively , passing through the ti @xmath29 site .",
    "as regards the magnetism , the system undergoes a ferromagnetic transition below the curie temperature @xmath30k.@xcite neglecting the spin - orbit coupling , we obtain a ferromagnetic ground state with the magnetic moment @xmath31per ti@xmath13 site ( @xmath32inside the muffin - tin sphere of ti@xmath13 site ) , consistent with the previous calculations.@xcite this value is a little larger than the experimental value @xmath33.@xcite the orbital polarization is underestimated to be very small .",
    "the ground state is obtained as a metal , although it is experimentally a semiconductor .",
    "the lda is known to have a tendency of wrongly predicting a metallic ground state .",
    "we think these shortcomings for the @xmath2 states have only minor effects on the @xmath4 states , since they have high energy ( @xmath16 ev above the fermi level ) .",
    "figure [ dosall ] shows the density of states projected onto the @xmath34 , @xmath19 , and @xmath35 symmetric states inside the muffin  tin sphere of a ti site . around @xmath36",
    "ev below the fermi level , the @xmath2 states form bonding states with the @xmath14 states of the neighboring o ions . around the fermi level",
    ", the @xmath2 states are highly concentrating in a form of antibonding states with the o @xmath14 states . in high energy region ,",
    "a broad band appears , to which the @xmath34 , @xmath19 and @xmath35 symmetric states equally contribute .",
    "the @xmath19 dos in this energy region is much smaller than the @xmath35 dos near the fermi level , as expected from the character of the atomic @xmath4 wave function that extends considerably in the interstitial region .",
    "the @xmath19 dos is enlarged in the inset .",
    "it has two peaks .",
    "note that the @xmath19 dos is roughly proportional to the @xmath0 edge absorption spectrum , if the effect of the core hole potential is neglected in the final states .",
    "this final state interaction may enhance the peak of the low energy side in the @xmath19 dos . in any event , the two - peak structure corresponds well to the absorption spectrum of yvo@xmath1.@xcite",
    "in the resonant process around the ti @xmath0 edge region , the @xmath37 core electron is virtually excited to the @xmath4 states .",
    "therefore the rxs spectra directly reflect the @xmath4 states at the scattering center .",
    "we specifically calculate the rxs intensities for the ( 100 ) , ( 001 ) and ( 011 ) reflections .",
    "it is obvious that the transition density matrix @xmath63 becomes symmetric with neglecting the spin ",
    "orbit interaction.@xcite using @xmath64 , @xmath42 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , functions of @xmath61 , the matrix at the ti 1 site can be represented as @xmath69 due to the crystal symmetry mentioned before , the transition density matrices @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 at the ti @xmath73 , ti @xmath74 , and ti @xmath75 sites are represented as @xmath76 using these representations , the scattering amplitudes are expressed in simple forms . for the ( 100 ) reflection , we have @xmath77 in the similar way , we have the scattering amplitude for the ( 001 ) and ( 011 ) reflections as @xmath78 only one of the off - diagonal elements remains in each expression of the scattering amplitudes , with the diagonal elements @xmath64 , @xmath42 , and @xmath65 completely vanishing . therefore , we can select out one of them by choosing the reflection index .",
    "the photon energy dependence is factored out from the polarization of photon in eqs .",

    "the rxs intensities @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are given by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "we calculate the rxs spectra on the crystal structure determined at room temperature in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the above formulas .",
    "we show in the following the results calculated in the ferromagnetic ground state of ytio@xmath1 , although the rxs experimental data are given above the curie temperature @xmath85.@xcite we checked that the rxs spectra are insensitive to the magnetic states by calculating the spectra also in a nonmagnetic state .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath4 dos above @xmath86 ev in fig .",
    "[ dosall ] , which shows no exchange splitting .",
    "figure [ rxsall ] shows the calculated spectra as a function of photon energy for the ( 100 ) , ( 001 ) and ( 011 ) reflections .",
    "note that the anisotropy of the coulomb interaction between the @xmath4 and the @xmath2 states is eliminated in the calculation by using the muffin - tin approximation .",
    "the experimental spectra in the low temperature phase of yvo@xmath1 are also shown for the sake of comparison,@xcite since their shapes are quite similar to the unpublished experimental data for the rxs spectra of ytio@xmath1.@xcite as already mentioned , the resemblance of the rxs spectra is quite understandable in the light of the mechanism of the distorted crystal structure , since both the jtd and the tilt of the vo@xmath3 octahedra in the low temperature phase of yvo@xmath1 are quite similar to those in ytio@xmath1 . in the ( 100 ) and ( 001 ) reflections ,",

    "( [ f100 ] ) , ( [ f001 ] ) , and ( [ f011 ] ) , the peaks belonging to the same scattering vectors show the same dependence . in the ( 100 ) and ( 001 ) reflections , the intensities are proportional to @xmath90 for the @xmath88 channel , with the condition @xmath91 at @xmath92 . in the the ( 011 ) reflection ,",
    "the intensities are proportional to @xmath93 for the @xmath87 channel , with the condition @xmath94 at @xmath92 , while the dependence is rather complicated for the @xmath88 channel .",
    "the calculated results are in agreement with the those of yvo@xmath1@xcite ( and also ytio@xmath1@xcite ) .",
    "to see more closely how the @xmath4 states are modified , we examine the @xmath4 density matrix @xmath95 at the ti 1 site , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ dmatrix ] .",
    "the left panel shows the representation in the @xmath96 system .",
    "although the diagonal elements are larger than the off - diagonal elements , the former quantity does not contribute to the rxs intensity .",
    "the right panel shows the representation in the local @xmath24 coordinate system .",
    "the off - diagonal elements remain comparable to those in the @xmath96 system , indicating that the @xmath24 axes are still deviating from the principal axes of the density matrix .",
    "since the off - diagonal elements are fluctuating with changing energy , the principal axes may also be fluctuating .",
    "one may think that the principal axes of the density matrix are related to the direction of the @xmath2 orbital polarization .",
    "however , this is not the case in the present calculation , since the @xmath2 orbital polarization has little effect on the @xmath4 states within the muffin - tin approximation .",
    "we interpret this as the sensitiveness of the @xmath4 states to the tilt of the tio@xmath3 octahedra which makes the local @xmath24 coordinate axes no longer principal axes .",
    "we have studied the effect of the crystal structure to the rxs spectra of ytio@xmath1 , using the band structure calculation within the lda .",
    "the calculated spectra are mainly compared with the experimental data of yvo@xmath1 , since the unpublished data of ytio@xmath1 are similar to those of yvo@xmath1 .",
    "this similarity is consistent with the mechanism of the distorted crystal structure .",
    "the obtained spectra as a function of photon energy are in agreement with the experiments of yvo@xmath1 ( and also ytio@xmath1 ) .",
    "since the muffin - tin approximation averages the coulomb interaction between the @xmath4 states and the @xmath2 states , the anisotropy of the coulomb interaction is eliminated in the calculation of the rxs spectra .",
    "we have clearly shown that along with the jtd the tilts of the transition - metal oxide octahedra need to be taken into account .",
    "the agreement between the calculation and the experiment suggests that the rxs intensity originates mainly from the distorted crystal structure , casting doubt on a prevailing assertion that the rxs is a direct observation of the orbital order .",
    "we hope that the present work could accelerate further study on the relation between the rxs and the orbital order .    in spite of the above findings",
    ", there are several points to be made clear .",
    "first , since the crystal structure includes both the jtd and the tilt of the tio@xmath3 octahedra , it is not clear which effect is important .",
    "closely related to this question , the crystal structure of yvo@xmath1 changes into a state of a very small jtd for @xmath97 k ( the tilt is not changed so much ) . according to this change , the intensities of peaks a and c were found to become very small , while those of other peaks were found to remain similar .",
    "this suggests that the effect of the jtd on the rxs spectra is different from that of the tilt of the octahedra . for clarifying this point and for a direct comparison with the experiment ,",
    "the calculation of the rxs spectra in the two cases of the atomic coordinates for yvo@xmath1 is now under progress .",
    "second , the intensities in the ( 100 ) reflection are @xmath98 smaller than those in the other reflections in the experiment of yvo@xmath1 ( and ytio@xmath1 ) .",
    "note that the samples are different for different reflections in the experiment .",
    "this may make the comparison of the data between different reflections less accurate.@xcite in any event , this behavior is not reproduced by the present calculation .",
    "it might improve the situation to go beyond the muffin - tin approximation in which the potential is crudely treated as a constant in the interstitial region .",
    "third , in addition to the rxs spectra mentioned above , another small peak has been observed about 10 ev below the main @xmath0 edge peak .",
    "since its azimuthal angle dependence is nearly the same as in other peaks,@xcite this pre - edge peak must come from the dipolar process .",
    "the presence of such pre - edge peaks has been predicted for lamno@xmath1.@xcite this study suggests that the pre - edge peak arises from the @xmath19 symmetric states ( centered at a ti site ) hybridizing to neighboring @xmath2 states in the intermediate states . since the orbital polarization is obtained very small in the present calculation , we are unable to handle the pre @xmath0 edge structure",
    ". the lda@xmath17 method may be suitable to treat this problem .",
