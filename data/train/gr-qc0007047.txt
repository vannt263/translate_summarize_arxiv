    "one has @xmath13 in standard general relativity , where @xmath14 . in 4d scalar - tensor theories , by contrast , @xmath15 and @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the generalized brans - dicke parameter and @xmath18 .",
    "the relative gravitational self - energy @xmath4 can be calculated for most objects in the solar system , subject to uncertainties in their mass density profiles .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath19 for the sun , while jupiter has @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "more precise estimates are available for the earth and moon , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively @xcite . with",
    "@xmath4 known , constraints on ep violation ( in theories of this kind ) take the form of upper limits on the ppn parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the latest such bounds ( from lunar laser ranging , or llr ) are of order @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "there exist , however , theories of gravity in which ep violations are not necessarily related to gravitational self - energy .",
    "in such theories , analysis of solar system data can lead only to upper limits on @xmath0 for the _ individual bodies _ involved .",
    "these limits will in general differ from object to object .",
    "they will , however , typically be orders of magnitude stronger than the above - mentioned experimental bound on @xmath6 ( since they are not diluted by the small factor @xmath4 ) . in what follows , we obtain numerical constraints on @xmath0 for the sun , moon , earth and jupiter , and apply these as an example to higher - dimensional ( kaluza - klein ) gravity , in which ep violations are related to the curvature of the extra part of the spacetime manifold .",
    "theories of gravity in more than four dimensions are older than general relativity @xcite , and most often associated with the names of kaluza @xcite and klein @xcite ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "the extra dimensions have traditionally been assumed to be compact , in order to explain their nonappearance in low - energy physics .",
    "the past few years , however , have witnessed an explosion of new interest in _",
    "non_-compactified theories of higher - dimensional gravity @xcite . in such theories",
    "the dimensionality of spacetime may in principle manifest itself at experimentally accessible energies .",
    "we examine here the theory of kaluza - klein gravity @xcite , and focus on the prototypical five - dimensional ( 5d ) case , although the extension to higher dimensions is straightforward in principle .    in 5d kaluza - klein gravity , objects such as stars and planets are modelled by a static , spherically - symmetric analog of the 4d schwarzschild solution known as the _ soliton metric_. this may be written ( following @xcite , but switching to nonisotropic form , and defining @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fifth coordinate , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a parameter related to the mass of the object at the center of the geometry , and the constants @xmath31 satisfy a consistency relation @xmath32 , or @xmath33 which follows from einstein s field equations .",
    "equation  ( [ sol_metric ] ) reduces to the 4d schwarzschild solution on hypersurfaces @xmath34  const as @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "solitons differ in interesting ways from 4d black holes , as discussed by many authors @xcite .",
    "of most relevance for our purposes is the fact that a soliton s gravitational mass ( as identified from the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath37 ) is given by @xmath38 , while its inertial mass ( as obtained using the landau - lifshitz energy - momentum pseudotensor ) turns out to be @xmath39 . using equations  ( [ def_delta ] ) and ( [ a_of_b ] )",
    ", it follows that @xmath40 it is important to recognize that @xmath41 is not a universal constant like @xmath6 , but depends in principle on local physics @xcite and may vary from soliton to soliton .",
    "( birkhoff s theorem in its usual form does not hold in higher - dimensional general relativity @xcite . ) to constrain the theory , one therefore hopes to apply as many tests as possible to a given astrophysical system .",
    "the classical tests of general relativity have been worked out for the soliton metric .",
    "data from long - baseline radio interferometry , ranging to the mars viking lander , and the perihelion precession of mercury imply that @xmath42 in the solar system @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "therefore , we keep only terms of second order or lower in @xmath41 .",
    "we also drop the negative roots in equation  ( [ a_of_b ] ) [ ie , the positive roots in equation  ( [ del_kk_roots ] ) ] , in order to eliminate the possibility of negative gravitational and/or inertial mass , and to ensure that the 4d schwarzschild solution is recovered ( for @xmath34  const ) as @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath43 which may be compared with equation  ( [ del_ppn ] ) for ppn - type theories . in kaluza - klein gravity ,",
    "experimental constraints on ep violation translate directly into upper bounds on the metric parameter @xmath41 , which characterizes the departure from flatness of the fifth dimension in the vicinity of the central mass .",
    "let us now proceed to see what experimental constraints can be placed on the parameter @xmath0 for solar system bodies .",
    "given any inverse - square law central force ( @xmath44 ) , it may be shown that the two - body problem admits as solutions elliptical orbits satisfying @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the orbital period , @xmath47 the semi - major axis , and @xmath48 the reduced mass of the system @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath49 is the inertial mass of the @xmath50th body . )",
    "we are concerned in this paper with the case in which @xmath51 , where the gravitational masses @xmath52 are related to the inertial ones @xmath49 by equation  ( [ def_delta ] ) .",
    "rearranging equation  ( [ kep3 ] ) , one then obtains the following modified form of kepler s third law @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mean orbital angular frequency , and @xmath55 refers ( here and elsewhere in the remainder of this paper ) to the _ gravitational _ mass of the @xmath50th body .",
    "equation  ( [ mod_kep3 ] ) was first obtained by nordtvedt using a somewhat different argument @xcite .",
    "if all bodies have the _ same _ value of @xmath0 , we will not see violations of the ep . the common part of @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be absorbed into a rescaled gravitational constant .",
    "one way to see this explicitly is to rewrite equation  ( [ mod_kep3 ] ) in the form @xmath58 there are two modifications to kepler s third law here : a rescaling of the value of @xmath59 in the first term , and a completely new second term , which depends only on the difference @xmath60 .",
    "this latter term is a clear manifestation of ep violation in the system .",
    "nevertheless , we can put experimental constraints on the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , even in cases where they are equal . to see this , divide equation  ( [ mod_kep4 ] ) through by @xmath61 and rearrange to obtain @xmath62 to within experimental uncertainty , of course , the left - hand side of this equation vanishes for planetary two - body systems ; this is a statement of kepler s third law .",
    "( more accurately , we may say that in standard theory , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are assumed to vanish , a statistical best - fit value is chosen for @xmath61 in such a way as to _ force _ the left - hand side as close to zero as possible for all systems observed . ) even when @xmath63 , therefore , observation imposes an upper bound on the possible size of the last term on the right - hand side .",
    "this reflects the fact that we have excellent experimental data , not only on possible violations of the ep , but also on the value of @xmath61 ( as well as @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) for most solar system objects .",
    "( the situation is less satisfactory for @xmath59 and @xmath66 considered individually @xcite , but these quantities are not needed here . )    we can use this extra knowledge to set limits on the _ sum _ , rather than the difference of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in combination with more purely ep - based constraints from the three - body problem , this will allow us to extract limits on the individual terms @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we therefore collect terms in @xmath56 and @xmath57 and recast equation  ( [ mod_kep5 ] ) in a form more suitable for contact with observation @xmath67 where @xmath50 is the gaussian constant , @xmath47 the semi - major axis of the orbit , and @xmath68 the length of the astronomical unit ( au ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath50 and @xmath68 are related via @xmath69 to the gravitational mass of the sun ( which is actually inferred in practice from a statistical fit to experimental data on @xmath68 ) .",
    "the length of the au ( @xmath70  m ) is currently known from planetary ranging data to better than @xmath71  m @xcite .",
    "to within experimental accuracy , the right - hand side of equation  ( [ kep_con ] ) vanishes ( as remarked above ; kepler s third law ) .",
    "our upper limits on the left - hand side are then just the sum of the relevant uncertainties in @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath47 , @xmath68 and @xmath65 ( @xmath50 is an exact quantity ) .    for the sun - jupiter system ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) , @xmath76  rad / yr )",
    "has an uncertainty which may be conservatively estimated at 1  arcsec/250  yr @xcite .",
    "the mean sun - jupiter distance @xmath77  au ) is likewise uncertain to about 200  km , based on post - fit residuals to all observational data @xcite ( not individual ranging measurements to jupiter , which are good to as little as 3  km @xcite ) . and",
    "the mass ratio @xmath78 ) is known to @xmath79 @xcite . combining these numbers",
    ", we find that @xmath80 the bulk of this is due to the uncertainty in @xmath47 , with a small remainder coming from uncertainty in @xmath73 .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath68 ( that is , in @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 are unimportant by comparison .    for the earth - moon system ( @xmath83 ) , @xmath84  rad / day ) has an uncertainty of less than 0.03  arcsec / century @xcite .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath85 ) is known to better than @xmath86 @xcite , while @xmath87 ) is good to @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the mean earth - moon distance @xmath89  km ) has been established to within 0.8  m by llr data @xcite .",
    "let us take the uncertainty in the length of the semi - major axis @xmath47 to be less than twice this figure , or 1.6  m. we then obtain @xmath90 in this case , while uncertainty in @xmath47 is still responsible for about three - quarters of the total , there are also substantial contributions from uncertainties in @xmath91 and @xmath92 . the decrease in importance of error in @xmath47 ( relative to the sun - jupiter case ) may be attributed to the high quality of the llr data .",
    "we turn next to the effects of ep violation on three - body motion in the solar system , beginning with the problem in which a test body is located at one of the stable lagrange points ( @xmath93 or @xmath94 ) in the orbit of one massive body @xmath95 ( a planet or moon , say ) around another ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "nordtvedt @xcite has shown that the location of @xmath97 is sensitive to @xmath98 for the largest of the three masses .",
    "we follow his notation , which is based on the assumption of circular orbits , but extend the calculation to cases in which all _ three _ objects can in principle display ep violations of the form  ( [ def_delta ] ) .",
    "the point @xmath97 is located at points where radial acceleration toward the @xmath96-@xmath95 center of mass ( @xmath99 , say ) is precisely balanced by centrifugal acceleration , and where there is no net acceleration perpendicular to this direction .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .  1 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 denote the distances from @xmath97 to @xmath96 and @xmath95 respectively , while @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the distances of @xmath97 , @xmath96 and @xmath95 from @xmath99 .",
    "it is straightforward to show @xcite that @xmath105 the effect of the @xmath0-terms , in other words , is to `` de - equilateralize '' the triangle made up by @xmath97 , @xmath96 and @xmath95 .",
    "it is further possible to solve explicitly for @xmath100 and @xmath101 ; one finds that @xmath106 ^3 & = & ( 1+{{\\delta}_{\\scriptscriptstyle { \\rm l}}})/(1+\\delta_2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ r_2/(r_1+r_2)\\right ] ^3 & = & ( 1+{{\\delta}_{\\scriptscriptstyle { \\rm l}}})/(1+\\delta_1 ) \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] denoting the unperturbed values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 by @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) , and assuming that the @xmath0-terms are much less than unity , we see that they lead to small movements of @xmath97 toward ( or away from ) @xmath96 and @xmath95 , as follows @xmath109 in the limits @xmath110 and @xmath111 , these results reduce to those given in @xcite .",
    "experimentally , one could use these results to obtain constraints on @xmath112 by ranging to a satellite at @xmath97 and looking for nonzero values of @xmath113 ( @xmath114 or @xmath115 ) . in the case of the earth - moon system ( @xmath116  earth , @xmath117  moon )",
    "this would require an artificial satellite such as the soho spacecraft ( which is however located at @xmath118 rather than @xmath119 or @xmath94 ) . in the case of the sun - jupiter system ( @xmath116  sun , @xmath117  jupiter ) one could instead make use of the larger trojan asteroids , of which 413 have now been identified @xcite , and some @xmath120 estimated to exist with radii over 1  km @xcite .",
    "such a procedure would however be hindered by low signal - to - noise levels and uncertainties involving factors such as surface topography .",
    "an observational quantity offering greater promise is the angular position @xmath121 of the stable lagrange point relative to the line through @xmath96 and @xmath95 ( see fig .  1 ) . for different values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 ,",
    "one will measure different angles @xmath122 .",
    "from the law of sines @xmath123 where @xmath9 may be determined from the law of cosines @xmath124 differentiating , and linearizing in the small parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 , one can show that @xmath127 inserting equations  ( [ del_rs ] ) into this expression , we obtain the general result @xmath128 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that this is a pure ep - violating effect can be seen from the fact that only _ differences _ of @xmath0-terms appear . in cases",
    "where @xmath129 , there is no migration of the lagrange point and @xmath130 .",
    "let us now specialize to cases in which @xmath96 is much more massive than @xmath95 , so that @xmath131 .",
    "( this is not a serious limitation as it describes all situations of interest in the solar system . )",
    "we also follow nordtvedt @xcite in assuming that the test object at @xmath97 differs from the much larger masses @xmath96 and @xmath95 in such a way that @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath134 a result that can be used to set constraints on @xmath135 if we have experimental data on any possible angular shift of the lagrange points from their expected locations 60 degrees behind and ahead of jupiter .",
    "it happens that we do have good observations of a number of trojan asteroids , the first of which was discovered over ninety years ago . to locate their mean angular position with sufficient precision for ep tests",
    "is however a significant challenge because these objects undergo _ librations _ about the lagrange points , with periods that are typically a good deal longer  of order 150  yr @xcite  than the timescale over which they have been observed .",
    "only twelve trojans ( 588  achilles , 911 agamenon , 1404  ajax , 1173  anchises , 1172  aneas , 1437  diomedes , 624  hector , 659  nestor , 1143  odysseus , 617  patroclus , 884  priamus and 1208  troilus ) have been observed for sixty years or more .",
    "so one has to fit orbits to an incomplete arc of observations .",
    "moreover the older observational data will be subject to larger random scatter than more recent measurements .",
    "there are also several potential sources of systematic error , including observational selection effects and the nonuniform distribution of asteroids , which may not necessarily cancel themselves out as the libration centers follow jupiter around the sky .",
    "the problem has nevertheless been seriously tackled in a pair of papers by orellana and vucetich @xcite .",
    "( the authors set out to obtain constraints on the ppn parameter @xmath6 , but we may relate this simply to @xmath122 by a constant factor , given as @xmath136  arcsec in @xcite . ) a formal least - squares statistical fit ( including a model for systematic errors ) produces the rather surprising result @xmath137  arcsec , which could perhaps be taken as a potential ep - violating signal . a more conservative procedure ,",
    "however , leads to a final value of @xmath138  arcsec , which is consistent with no signal . based on this latter limit we adopt the upper bound @xmath139  arcsec .",
    "this compares reasonably with planetary angular measurements , which are typically accurate to between 0.1 and 1  arcsec @xcite . in combination with equation  ( [ mig_ang ] ) this bound leads to the constraint @xmath140 this is an order of magnitude weaker than the limit  ( [ kep_con1 ] ) on the sum @xmath141 for the sun - jupiter system from kepler s third law , and almost _ three _ orders of magnitude weaker than the corresponding limit  ( [ kep_con2 ] ) for the earth - moon system",
    ". nevertheless equation  ( [ lag_con ] ) will prove useful in constraining the value of @xmath142 .",
    "we turn next to the best - known probe of ep violations in the solar system , the polarization of a two - body orbit in the field of a third body , also known variously as the nordtvedt effect and the lunar etvs experiment .",
    "this was investigated by nordtvedt in the context of the earth - moon - sun system @xcite and the sun - earth - jupiter system @xcite , and has been the subject of numerous studies since @xcite .",
    "we follow the approach of will @xcite , but extend his notation to general three - body systems . the situation is illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "including their mutual attraction ( but neglecting any quadrupole or higher moments ) , the two massive bodies @xmath96 and @xmath95 described by equation  ( [ def_delta ] ) will fall toward @xmath143 with different accelerations given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the 3-vectors connecting @xmath143 to @xmath96 and @xmath95 respectively , and @xmath147 is the 3-vector from @xmath96 to @xmath95 .",

    "the results least affected will be those based on the lunar nordtvedt effect  equation  ( [ nor_con1 ] )  for which ep - violating terms have been included in the solution sets .",
    "our other results  equations  ( [ kep_con1 ] ) , ( [ kep_con2 ] ) , ( [ lag_con ] ) , ( [ nor_con2 ] ) and ( [ kep_con3 ] )  may be less robust in comparison . a fully rigorous future treatment would rely on new statistical fits incorporating an independent parameter @xmath199 for each body , rather than parametrizing ep violations with a single universal constant .",
    "let us now see what equations  ( [ del_sun1 ] )  ( [ del_ear2 ] ) imply for 5d kaluza - klein gravity , in which [ as we recall from equation  ( [ del_kk ] ) ] @xmath220 , where @xmath41 is a free parameter which characterizes the departure from flatness of the fifth dimension in the vicinity of the massive body .",
    "our constraints on this parameter follow immediately from equations  ( [ del_jup ] ) , ( [ del_moo ] ) , ( [ del_sun2 ] ) and ( [ del_ear2 ] ) , and may be summarized together as follows @xmath221 these upper bounds on @xmath41 are far more stringent than any obtained so far by other means . in particular , the result  ( [ b_ear ] ) for the earth is more than three orders of magnitude stronger than that which may be expected using data on geodetic precession from the upcoming gravity probe  b satellite @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ b_jup ] ) for jupiter is more stringent by five orders of magnitude than the limits which may be obtained using light deflection by the giant planet @xcite . and",
    "the upper limit  ( [ b_sun ] ) for the sun is more than _ six _ orders of magnitude tighter than those set so far from the classical tests of general relativity ( light deflection using long - baseline radio interferometry , mercury s perihelion precession , and time delay using the mars viking lander @xcite ) .",
    "we have looked for the constraints imposed by solar system data on theories in which the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass differs from unity by some factor @xmath0 which may in principle differ from body to body . for two objects characterized by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , upper bounds on the sum @xmath222 have been found from kepler s third law , while the difference @xmath223 can be constrained by data on the position of lagrange libration points , and orbital polarization in the field of a third body ( the nordtvedt effect ) .",
    "( here @xmath224 and @xmath225 are known constants . ) combining these results , we have extracted independent upper limits on @xmath0 for the sun , moon , earth and jupiter , using experimental data on their orbits as well as those of the trojan asteroids . in particular , we find that @xmath226 for the sun , earth and moon , and @xmath227 for jupiter .    as a test case",
    ", we have applied these results to five - dimensional kaluza - klein gravity , in which @xmath0 can be shown to depend on a parameter @xmath41 of the five - dimensional metric which characterizes the curvature of the extra dimension near the central mass .",
    "our upper bounds on this parameter are three to six orders of magnitude stronger than existing limits on @xmath41 from the classical ( and geodetic precession ) tests of general relativity , and confirm earlier conclusions @xcite that a fifth dimension , if any , plays no significant role in the dynamics of the solar system .",
