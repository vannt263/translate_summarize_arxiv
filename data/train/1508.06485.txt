    "the history of surface evolution of small asteroids is recorded on their surface terrain .",
    "impacts of various - sized meteoroids are the most important processes to discuss the asteroid surface evolution .",
    "for instance , regolith grains are generated and mixed by repeated impact events .",
    "this _ gardening _ effect keeps the surface fresh and active ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent planetary explorations have revealed a rich variety of surface terrains that can not be understood only by the impact cratering and resultant gardening effect .",
    "for instance , asteroid eros , which was explored by nasa s space probe _ near shoemaker _ from february 2000 , showed the interesting characteristics .",
    "based on the observational result , @xcite reported the surface blocks distribution that can not be explained by the potential source craters . to explain the distribution , they discussed the possibility of the size sorting in the vibrated regolith bed .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite also reported that the surface regolith of asteroid itokawa , which was explored by the japanese space probe _ hayabusa _ , could migrate and be segregated .",
    "in addition , impact craters on the surface of itokawa are very vague  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of tiny samples returned from itokawa also supports regolith migration .",
    "@xcite observed some round - shape particles that might be worn away by friction between regolith grains .",
    "moreover , the cosmic - ray exposure ( cre ) age of itokawa s returned particles are measured by  @xcite and  @xcite . according to these studies ,",
    "the upper limit of cre age is approximately @xmath3 myr and its probable value is 1.5 myr .",
    "this value is relatively young compared to the cre age of most of the ll chondrites .",
    "all the above - mentioned observations and findings suggest that the regolith migration process plays a crucial role in the surface evolution on small asteroids such as eros and itokawa .    for the driving force of regolith migration on itokawa",
    ",  @xcite followed the idea of @xcite ; they considered the size segregation of vibrated regolith layer .",
    "they supposed that the impact - induced global seismic shaking could result in the convection of regolith grains .",
    "moreover , the size segregation of regolith grains could also be driven by regolith convection .",
    "although the impact - induced seismic shaking has not been directly observed on asteroids ,  @xcite and  @xcite developed a model of the global seismic shaking on asteroid eros to investigate the crater erasure process .",
    "recently , @xcite has also computed seismic wave propagation on asteroids in kilometric and sub - kilometric size ranges . using the global seismic shaking model of  @xcite and  @xcite",
    ",  @xcite showed that the regolith convection induced by global seismic shaking can be caused even by small - scale impacts .",
    "for instance , 1 cm impactor with the impact velocity @xmath4 @xmath5 is sufficient to achieve the global seismic shaking on itokawa because the itokawa s surface gravity is extremely low , @xmath6  m  s@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "thus , the effect of collective granular motion on the surface of asteroid could be very important for properly considering the surface evolution  @xcite .",
    "in fact , granular convection can readily be observed when the granular matter is subjected to the vertical vibration in the laboratory experiment ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in granular convection induced by vertical vibration ,",
    "the most important parameter is a ratio between the maximum vibrational acceleration and gravitational acceleration , @xmath8 , where , @xmath9 , @xmath2 and @xmath10 are the amplitude of vibration , its frequency , and gravitational acceleration , respectively . the onset criterion of granular convection can be approximately written as @xmath11 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , if the vibrated granular matter consists of polydisperse grains , the vertical size segregation of grains can also be observed .",
    "this vibration - induced size segregation is called brazil nut effect ( bne ) .",
    "granular convection is considered a plausible reason for the bne in the vertically vibrated granular bed  @xcite .",
    "recently , the gravity dependence of granular convective motion has been investigated on the basis of laboratory experiments  @xcite and numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the gravity dependence of the velocity of shear - driven convective motion by using the parabolic flight method .",
    "they reported that the convective velocity is significantly reduced under the microgravity condition while it is enhanced under the high - gravity condition .",
    "@xcite also performed an experiment of convection - driven bne using the vibrated granular bed on parabolic flights .",
    "they found that the rise velocity of an intruder in the vibrated granular bed is roughly proportional to the gravitational acceleration @xmath10 . @xcite",
    "numerically computed the threshold velocity @xmath12 to induce bne and reported @xmath13 .",
    "it should be noticed that , however , @xmath12 is the threshold velocity above which segregation starts .",
    "@xcite numerically investigated the convection - driven bne and found that the rise velocity of an intruder in the vibrated granular bed is proportional to @xmath14 . in order to evaluate the gravity dependence of granular convective velocity",
    ", the scaling method has been used in  @xcite .",
    "the researchers investigated the convective velocity under the steady vertical vibration on the ground .",
    "using an experimentally obtained scaling relation , they found that the convective velocity is scaled by @xmath15 .",
    "while the intruder s rise velocity ( bne rate ) and convective velocity are different quantities , @xcite is roughly consistent with  @xcite .",
    "however , the reason of difference between @xcite and @xcite remains unclear . in any case",
    ", all these experimental and numerical results suggest that the granular convection can occur with very low velocity even under the microgravity condition .    in general , the characteristic timescale for gravity - related phenomena",
    "is elongated under the microgravity condition .",
    "for instance , the penetration timescale of an intruder into a granular target increases under the low - gravity condition  @xcite . for granular ( regolith ) convection , the characteristic timescale would become very long under the microgravity condition because the convective velocity , which is inversely proportional to the timescale , is significantly reduced under the microgravity condition as mentioned above .",
    "therefore , it is not obvious whether the low convective velocity can really resurface the various - sized s - type asteroids covered with regolith within the reasonable timescale .",
    "the estimate of timescale is necessary to assess the feasibility of the resurfacing by regolith convection .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to build a model of resurfacing process induced by regolith convection for asteroids covered with regolith . using the model , timescale of the resurfacing",
    "can be estimated .",
    "then , the resurfacing timescale should be compared with other timescales such as the mean collisional lifetime .",
    "based on the comparison , we discuss the feasibility of the resurfacing process driven by regolith convection on the surface of asteroids .",
    "this paper is composed of following sections . in the next section",
    ", we build a model of the resurfacing process .",
    "section  [ sec : result ] presents the estimate of resurfacing timescale .",
    "in addition , the scaling analysis for the estimated timescale is discussed in this section . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we compare the resurfacing timescale with other timescales and verify the feasibility of the regolith - convection - driven resurfacing .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] mentions conclusions .",
    "in order to estimate the resurfacing timescale , we make a simple model of the asteroid resurfacing process driven by regolith convection .",
    "the regolith convection is caused by impact - induced global seismic shaking . in the model",
    ", we divide the resurfacing process into three steps as follows :    1 .",
    "impact : impactors intermittently collide with a target asteroid , 2 .",
    "vibration : each collision leads to a seismic shaking , 3 .",
    "convection : the seismic shaking induces the regolith convection on the asteroid .    fig .",
    "[ fig : resurface ] shows the schematic illustration of the model . repeating the series of three steps ,",
    "the asteroids can be resurfaced by regolith convection .    in the convection step ,",
    "we assume that the iteration of small convective migrations constitutes the well - ordered ( reproducible ) convective roll structure . in fig .",
    "[ fig : resurface ] , each red arrow corresponds to the migration length driven by each impact event , and they collectively construct the well - ordered identical convective roll . although one may feel that this assumption is not so plausible , some experimental works have reported that the intermittently tapped granular bed can construct the well - ordered convective motion or bne  @xcite .",
    "the details of steps ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) are written in sections  [ subsubsec : impactor ] ,  [ subsubsec : shaking ] , and  [ subsubsec : convection ] , respectively .",
    "finally , we unify these three steps and compute the resurfacing timescale .",
    "the unification is described in section  [ subsec : timescale ] .    .",
    "we assume that the convective roll size @xmath16 corresponds to the surface migration length of the convecting regolith . ]",
    "the frequency of impacts per year @xmath17 is a necessary quantity to build the model .",
    "@xmath17 is estimated from the population of small objects @xmath18 of diameter @xmath19 . to estimate @xmath18 for the main belt asteroid ( mba ) and near - earth asteroid ( nea ) ,",
    "there have been two models based on the dynamical evolution of the main belt population :  @xcite ( called hereafter obg population ) and @xcite ( called hereafter bal population ) .",
    "the range of estimated impactor size in obg population is broader than that of bal population , and both are in good agreement with the currently observed population in the main belt .",
    "only the minor differences can be recognized between these two models . here , we employ the obg population to compute @xmath17 .",
    "[ fig : nicum_di ] shows the cumulative number distribution of potential impactors @xmath20 for mbas and neas , estimated by obg population .    by numerically differentiating @xmath21",
    ", we can obtain the incremental distribution of @xmath18 of small bodies with diameters between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the index of the binned data ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 is described as @xmath28 here , we consider the representative value of size @xmath29 because the obg population data adapted logarithmic bin size for @xmath22 .     vs.  impactor diameter @xmath30 .",
    "red open circles and blue open triangles respectively show the numerical data for mbas and neas computed by  @xcite .",
    "the solid lines are power - law fits . ]    by multiplying @xmath18 by the annual mean collision probability per collisional cross - section @xmath31 and the collisional cross - section @xmath32 , we can compute the number of impacts per year @xmath17 .",
    "the specific form of @xmath17 is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the diameter of target asteroid . since this procedure",
    "is applied to all @xmath24 data , we omit the subscript @xmath24 hereafter . in this study , we use the constant values @xmath35",
    "@xmath36 for the collision of mbas  @xcite and @xmath37 @xmath36 for the collision of neas  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath17 can merely be defined as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath34  @xcite . actually , the value of @xmath31 depends on the location and orbit of small bodies . here",
    "we neglect such higher - order effects and consider the mean value .",
    "next , the strength of seismic shaking @xmath38 , which corresponds to the maximum vibration acceleration normalized to the gravitational acceleration , has to be estimated for each impact event . based on previous reports , we assume that the regolith convection can be induced by the global seismic shaking satisfying @xmath39",
    ". moreover , we use the previous experimental result , in which the granular convective velocity is scaled by @xmath38  @xcite , to compute the regolith convective velocity .    to estimate @xmath38 caused by meteoroid impacts , we employ the global seismic shaking model proposed by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the model is based on two assumptions .",
    "first , the kinetic energy of the impactor is transferred to the seismic energy with the impact seismic efficiency factor @xmath1 .",
    "second , the transferred seismic energy is equally distributed to the entire target asteroid by the diffusion of seismic energy density .",
    "namely , the homogeneous seismic energy distribution is considered as an average picture .",
    "the distributed seismic energy density attenuates due to the inelasticity of the internal structure of asteroids .",
    "the attenuation of seismic energy density is characterized by the seismic quality factor @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , spherical shape of the target asteroid is assumed for the sake of simplicity .",
    "although the numerical and observational evidences for the validity of this model are still very limited , this model offers an analytic way to compute the global seismic shaking on small bodies , and the analytic result was compared with numerical simulations  @xcite . from these considerations , @xmath38 can be calculated as ( @xcite , @xcite and its som ) ,    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the density of the target asteroid , @xmath42 is the density of impactor , @xmath2 is the dominant seismic frequency , @xmath43 is the mean impact velocity , @xmath44 is the elapsed time from the moment of impact , and @xmath45 is the gravitational constant . fig .

    "hereafter , we basically use these parameter values as standard ones in the following computations unless otherwise noted . because we mainly focus on the porous rubble - pile or very fractured target asteroids , the relatively low density for the target @xmath50 @xmath51",
    "is utilized as the standard one . for the dominant seismic frequency ,  @xcite and",
    "@xcite mentioned that it falls in @xmath56 hz for asteroid eros due to the fractured inner structures which act as natural band - pass filter for seismic frequency .",
    "in addition , they assumed @xmath53 on the asteroid eros based on the similarity between internal structure of fractured s - type asteroids and upper lunar crust .",
    "recently ,  @xcite has represented that the dominant frequency should increase as the asteroid size decreases . in addition",
    ", they reported that the relatively high frequency ( @xmath57 hz ) dominates the vibration on itokawa - sized asteroid when the monolithic core structure and low dissipation ( @xmath53 ) are assumed .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is the difference in assumption of the asteroid internal structure .",
    "moreover , its value could vary depending on inhomogeneity of the internal structure . to consider the diffusion of seismic energy density , the highly inhomogeneous structure must be assumed . here",
    ", we temporarily employ the constant value as standard ones mainly on the basis of  @xcite .",

    "the basis of this speculation ( @xmath65 ) is the preliminary observation of the tapped granular layer  @xcite . according to the experimental result ,",
    "however , very small @xmath66 may also be able to produce a well - ordered convective structure by the accumulation of intermittent tappings . since @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath67 ( eq .  ( [ eq : timescale_app_mba ] ) ) or @xmath68 ( eq .  ( [ eq : timescale_app_nea ] ) ) , the smaller @xmath63 results in the shorter @xmath60 .",

    "the accurate determination of @xmath16 and @xmath63 is a very important future problem to be investigated .    as discussed in section  [ sec : introduction ] , gravity dependence of granular convection is still under debate .",

    "even if the dominant frequency of seismic shaking is quite high ( @xmath94 hz ) as reported by  @xcite , small regolith grains ( @xmath98 m ) can be resurfaced within the mean collisional lifetime .",

    "<S> although these parameter values might depend on asteroid size , we employ the standard values to estimate the representative behavior . to clarify the parameter dependences , we develop an approximated scaling form for the resurfacing timescale . </S>",
    "<S> according to the estimated result , we find that the regolith - convection - based resurfacing timescale is shorter than the mean collisional lifetime in most of the parameter uncertainty ranges . </S>",
    "<S> these parameter ranges are within those reported by previous works for small asteroids . </S>",
