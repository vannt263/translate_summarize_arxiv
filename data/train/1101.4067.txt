    "for three - dimensional ( 3d ) autonomous hyperbolic type of chaotic systems , a commonly accepted criterion for proving the existence of chaos is due to ilnikov [ 1 - 4 ] , which has a slight extension recently [ 5 ] .",
    "chaos in the ilnikov type of 3d autonomous quadratic dynamical systems may be classified into four subclasses [ 6 ] :    @xmath0 chaos of the ilnikov homoclinic - orbit type ;    @xmath0 chaos of the ilnikov heteroclinic - orbit type ;    @xmath0 chaos of the hybrid type with both ilnikov homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits ;    @xmath0 chaos of other types .    in this classification ,",
    "a system is required to have a saddle - focus type of equilibrium , which belongs to the hyperbolic type at large .",
    "notice that although most chaotic systems are of hyperbolic type , there are still many others that are not so . for",
    "non - hyperbolic type of chaos , saddle - focus equilibrium typically does not exist in the systems , as can be seen from table i which includes several non - hyperbolic chaotic systems found by sprott [ 7 - 10 ] .",
    "more recently , yang and chen also found a chaotic system with one saddle and two stable node - foci [ 11 ] and , moreover , an unusual 3d autonomous quadratic lorenz - like chaotic system with only two stable node - foci [ 12 ] .",
    "in fact , similar examples can be easily found from the literature .",

    "for such a system , one almost surely would expect asymptotically convergent behaviors or , at best , would not anticipate chaos per se .    from table",
    "i , one may observe that the sprott d and e systems also have only one equilibrium , but nevertheless this equilibrium is not stable .",
    "from this point of view , it is easy to understand and indeed easy to prove that the new system will not be topologically equivalent to the sprott systems .",
    "the mechanism of generating the new system is simple and intuitive .    to start with ,",
    "let us first review some of the sprott chaotic systems listed in table i , namely those with only one equilibrium .",
    "one can easily see that systems i ,",
    "j , l , n and r all have only one saddle - focus equilibrium , while systems d and e both degenerate in the sense that their jacobian eigenvalues at the equilibria consist of one conjugate pair of pure imaginary numbers and one real number .",
    "clearly , the corresponding equilibria are not stable .",
    "it is also easy to imagine that a tiny perturbation to the system may be able to change such a degenerate equilibrium to a stable one .",
    "therefore , we added a simple constant control parameter to an aforementioned sprott chaotic system , trying to change the stability of its single equilibrium to a stable one while preserving its chaotic dynamics .    as a result",
    ", we obtained the following new system : @xmath33    when @xmath34 , it is the sprott e system ; when @xmath35 , however , the stability of the single equilibrium is fundamentally different , as can be verified and compared between the results shown in table i and table ii , respectively .",
