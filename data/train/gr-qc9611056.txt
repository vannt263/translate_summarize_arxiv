    "perturbative studies of relativistic , spherical collapse have elucidated dynamical features of gravitational collapse important to an understanding of black hole formation and the subsequent relaxation to a stationary state ( see for example  @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "quasi - normal ringing could provide direct evidence of the existence of black holes if observed  @xcite . at late times , quasi - normal oscillations are swamped by the radiative tail of the gravitational collapse  @xcite .",
    "this tail radiation is of interest in its own right since it originates from the non - trivial propagation of the field perturbations on the background spacetime ",
    "zero rest - mass fields do not necessarily propagate along the light - cone in a curved spacetime .    the first authoritative study of nearly spherical collapse , exhibiting radiative tails , was performed by price @xcite .",
    "studying the behaviour of a massless scalar field propagating on a fixed schwarzschild background , he showed that the field dies off with the now familiar power - law tail @xmath1 at late times , where @xmath2 is the multipole order of the field , and @xmath3 if the field is initially static and @xmath4 otherwise .",
    "furthermore , price showed that the perturbations of any zero rest - mass , integer - spin field are governed by a wave equation with the same qualitative form as that governing the scalar field .",
    "this suggests that the results for the scalar field should apply equally well to the radiatable multipoles of both the electromagnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "similar results for a massless scalar field propagating on a reissner - nordstrm background have been obtained by bik @xcite .",
    "no such analytic result has yet been obtained for the case of a black hole with angular momentum , though krivan _",
    "_ @xcite have recently performed numerical work which suggests the power law tail holds independently of the angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "while test - field calculations are extremely compelling , it is natural to ask to what extent linear analyses are representative of dynamical gravitational collapse .",
    "if either quasi - normal ringing , or radiative tails , should be absent in non - linear collapse one might view results of linear analyses with scepticism .",
    "advances in numerical relativity make it possible to address this issue in the spherically symmetric context .",
    "gmez and winicour @xcite studied the non - linear evolution of a self - gravitating , spherically symmetric , massless scalar field concluding that the scalar monopole moment decayed exponentially rather than with the power - law predicted by the linear analyses .",
    "more recently , gundlach , price and pullin @xcite re - examined this problem .",
    "they were able to show that the frequencies of quasi - normal oscillations , and decay rates of the power - law tails , found in the numerical solutions , are in good agreement with the predictions of perturbation theory ( though one must go to sufficiently late times in order to see tail effects  this would , in part , explain the null result of gmez and winicour ) .    the presence , and slow decay , of wave tails at late times is a key ingredient leading to the instability of cauchy horizons inside charged and rotating black holes . for black holes in asymptotically flat spacetime , the inverse power - law decay of perturbing fields at the event horizon has been used to provide initial data in linear  @xcite and non - linear  @xcite studies of the black hole interior . in particular , the form of the wave tail is largely responsible for the weakness of the mass - inflation singularity inside charged black holes  @xcite , and is believed to have similar consequences inside rotating holes  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the asymptotically flat case , perturbative  @xcite and non - linear  @xcite studies indicate that the inner cauchy horizon of charged and rotating black holes immersed in asymptotically de  sitter space can be stable .",
    "that stability persists for a finite volume of the parameter space suggests that these spacetimes violate the letter ( if not the spirit ) of the cosmic censorship hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the radiative tail of perturbations at late times plays a major role in these analyses .",
    "plausible arguments suggest that an exponential decay of the tails replaces the power law behaviour observed in asymptotically flat space  @xcite , however , no detailed analysis of the evolution of wave tails in asymptotically de  sitter - black hole spacetimes exists .",
    "the present work reports on such a study for non - rotating black holes .",
    "our primary motivation has been to obtain correct boundary conditions on the radiation at the event horizon for use in a numerical study of the internal structure of charged black holes in de  sitter space  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we consider the propagation of massless , minimally coupled scalar fields on the schwarzschild - de  sitter and reissner - nordstrm - de  sitter black - hole backgrounds .",
    "we derive the equation governing the scalar test - field , and numerically integrate it .",
    "two independent numerical codes were used throughout the linear analysis ; a null evolution scheme following that of gundlach  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and a cauchy evolution scheme similar to that described by krivan _",
    "we found complete agreement between them .",
    "our results show that , except for the @xmath0 mode , the field falls off exponentially at the cosmological and black - hole event horizons , and at future timelike infinity .",
    "the rate of decay depends upon the surface gravity , @xmath5 , of the cosmological horizon [ see  eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) ] , and the multipole order of the field .",
    "in particular , as @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the field approaches a constant value at late times rather than decaying .",
    "a suggestion of this behaviour can be found in the analysis of chambers and moss  @xcite and , as argued there , is similar to the situation within the black hole interior . in section iii",
    ", we study the non - linear evolution of a spherically symmetric , self - gravitating scalar field by numerically integrating the coupled einstein - scalar field equations .",
    "confining attention to spherical symmetry implies we gain information solely about the @xmath9 mode of the field .",
    "we find , in accord with our linear analysis , that the field approaches a constant value at the cosmological event horizon , the black hole event horizon and future timelike infinity , demonstrating that the results of our linear analysis are indicative of the full theory .",
    "further to this , we inspect the behaviour of the field s stress - energy , showing that @xmath10 with @xmath11 to within about @xmath12 . in section",
    "iv we make some final comments about the implications of our results for cauchy horizon stability in black - hole - de  sitter spacetimes and the related issue of cosmic censorship .",
    "in this section , we consider a massless , minimally coupled , scalar field propagating on a fixed reissner - nordstrm - de  sitter background .",
    "since our considerations are limited to the black hole exterior , it is clear that the schwarzschild - de  sitter case can always be obtained by setting the charge @xmath13 ( when this fails , we explicitly include the corresponding formulae ) .",
    "the generalization of the reissner - nordstrm metric to include a cosmological constant was first given by carter  @xcite as @xmath14 where @xmath15 in eq.([2.2 ] ) , @xmath16 denotes the mass of the black hole , @xmath17 its charge and @xmath18 is the cosmological constant .",
    "if @xmath19 there are three horizons located at the roots of @xmath20 ; an inner ( cauchy ) horizon at @xmath21 , a black hole event horizon at @xmath22 and a cosmological horizon located at @xmath23 such that @xmath24 ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the fourth root , @xmath25 , is negative and thus non - physical .",
    "( when @xmath13 there are only two horizons ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) the black hole event horizon , @xmath26 , and the cosmological event horizon , @xmath27 , while the third root , @xmath28 is negative . )",

    "when the root corresponds to a physical horizon in the spacetime , @xmath33 is the surface gravity of that horizon  @xcite .",
    "finally , we introduce a pair of null coordinates on the spacetimes , the advanced time @xmath34 and the retarded time @xmath35 , in terms of which the interval ( [ 2.1 ] ) reduces to , @xmath36 the definition we have adopted means that the future cosmological horizon @xmath37 is located at @xmath38 , and the future black - hole event horizon @xmath22 is at @xmath39 . in terms of the null coordinates @xmath40 , the scalar wave equation , @xmath41 , becomes @xmath42    height10pt width0.7pt -10pt    ' '' ''    height0.7pt width245pt    where we have decomposed the field @xmath43 into its constituent multipole pieces , i.e. @xmath44 .",

    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "it is straightforward to integrate eq.([2.5a ] ) on a null grid using the methods described by gundlach _",
    "further details can be found in their article .    since tail effects are independent of the initial data used , we chose to represent a generic initial perturbation by a gaussian pulse on @xmath50 @xmath51 ( the amplitude @xmath52 is irrelevant since eq .",

    "gundlach _ et al . _",
    "@xcite argued that the nature of the tails in asymptotically flat spacetimes is primarily due to the power - law form of the effective potential as @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , ching _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that inverse power - law tails , as seen in spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat spacetimes , are not generic .",
    "therefore , it should not be surprising that tails , in asymptotically de  sitter spacetimes , fall off exponentially with time since the effective potential is exponentially suppressed as @xmath66 .",
    "what is unexpected is that the the @xmath0 modes do not decay to zero , rather a generic perturbation leads to a residual constant field at late times .",
    "( of course , there is no stress - energy associated with a constant field . )",
    "this was suggested in a paper by chambers and moss  @xcite where it was argued that the situation in schwarzschild - de  sitter spacetime is somewhat analogous to scattering inside a black hole  @xcite , and hence a constant mode can be transmitted to both the black - hole and cosmological event horizons .",
    "indeed , the field at late times behaves like @xmath67    figure  [ fig:4 ] demonstrates this effect .",
    "the early time behaviour of the field , @xmath43 , is dominated by the quasi - normal ringing , whose explicit features we are not currently interested in . at later times",
    "the field quickly approaches the same constant value at the cosmological event horizon , the black - hole event horizon and future timelike infinity .",

    "one must contrast this to previous results for asymptotically flat spacetimes where the field always approaches zero .",
    "monitoring the behaviour of @xmath68 during the evolution ( this is a matter of formality in the cauchy code , as it uses momenta @xmath69 for the evolution ) has allowed us to conclude that the numerical value of the exponent in eq.([11 ] ) is indeed @xmath70 to within @xmath71 : taking the time derivative of eq.([11 ] ) yields @xmath72 , thus the fitted values for @xmath5 can be compared with the ones obtained from eq.([6 ] ) .    in general ,",
    "the final field value , @xmath73 , is a function of the black hole parameters @xmath74 .",
    "we investigated the dependance of @xmath73 on the cosmological constant @xmath18 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdafit ] for the case @xmath75 , our results indicate that @xmath76 .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient @xmath77 of @xmath78 versus @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 .",
    "for @xmath81 the picture is different , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "the early time behaviour of the field is still dominated by complicated quasi - normal ringing , but at late times a definite exponential fall - off is manifest . in particular , the late time wave tails are well approximated by @xmath82 . in a series of separate evolutions we found that for sufficiently small values of @xmath18 , a regime of power law decay followed the quasi - normal ringing , though at late times the exponential decay described above always dominates .",
    "given the somewhat unusual behaviour of the @xmath0 modes elucidated by the test field analysis , it seems necessary to examine the non - linear evolution of a self - gravitating massless , scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "this situation is described by the coupled einstein - scalar field equations @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the stress - energy of the scalar field which satisfies @xmath85 . restricting attention to spherical symmetry ( thus we only gain information about the @xmath0 mode )",

    "the coordinates have been normalized so that @xmath64 is the proper time at the origin , thus @xmath89 .",
    "it is customary @xcite to introduce two new fields @xmath90 and @xmath91 defined by @xmath92 in terms of these variables the field equations ( [ 3.1 ] ) become @xmath93 and the wave equation is @xmath94 \\ ; . \\label{3.7}\\ ] ] a well established numerical algorithm exists to integrate these equations  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to these articles for details .",
    "initial data for the non - linear equations is supplied on an initial null cone centered on the origin .",
    "we considered a gaussian pulse on @xmath50 , with an amplitude @xmath95 , width @xmath96 , and centered on @xmath97 .",
    "the code was tested against the exact solution in  @xcite .",
    "we also reproduced power - law tails in complete agreement with @xcite , when @xmath98 .",
    "figure  [ fig:8 ] shows @xmath99 ( or equivalently @xmath43 ) at the cosmological event horizon , the black hole event horizon and along an @xmath100 surface .",
    "the agreement with the linear analysis is remarkable .",
    "we again see an initial period of quasi - normal ringing which decays , leaving behind a constant field at late times .",
    "furthermore , using ( [ 3.5 ] ) and ( [ 3.6c ] ) we can write @xmath101 and examine the stress - energy of the field at late times . figure  [ fig:9 ] suggests that @xmath102 $ ] at late times , as suggested by the the test - field analysis .",
    "this study of wave - tail evolution in black hole - de  sitter spacetimes has revealed consistent but interesting results .",
    "the radiative tails associated with a massless , minimally coupled scalar field propagating on the fixed backgrounds of a schwarzschild - de  sitter and reissner - nordstrm - de  sitter black hole decay exponentially at the cosmological horizon , the black hole event horizon and at future timelike infinity .",
    "that is , for all modes except the @xmath0 mode , it approaches a constant at late times .",
    "we have further explored this result by considering the non - linear problem of a scalar field coupled to gravity and numerically integrating the einstein - scalar field equations .",
    "these results show excellent agreement with the linear analysis .",
    "though the introduction of a non - zero cosmological constant into the einstein equations may be argued to be somewhat unrealistic , it is the issue of cauchy horizon stability in black hole - de  sitter spacetimes  @xcite and the related issue of cosmic censorship  @xcite , that motivates this investigation .",
    "the power - law tails found by price @xcite have been used as initial data in arguments pertaining to the instability of the inner ( cauchy ) horizon of both the reissner - nordstrm and kerr black hole spacetimes and the associated phenomenon of mass inflation .",
    "linear perturbation studies suggest that the cauchy horizon inside black holes embedded in de  sitter space may be stable  fluxes of linear perturbations remain bounded at the cauchy horizon .",
    "this in itself does not guarantee stability though . a fully non - linear analysis of the black hole interior is needed , for which the late - time wave tails at the event horizon serve as initial data . with the results of this paper in hand , we can now embark on a numerical study of the cauchy horizon in reissner - nordstrm - de  sitter , along the lines of brady and smith  @xcite .",
