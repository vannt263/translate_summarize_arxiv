    "phase separation is important for white dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "as a star cools , and crystallization takes place , the crystal phase is enriched in oxygen while the liquid is enriched in carbon .",
    "we believe phase separation may also be important for neutron stars that accrete material from a companion .",
    "this material can undergo nuclear reactions involving rapid proton capture ( the rp process ) to synthesize a variety of medium mass nuclei @xcite .",
    "further accretion increases the density of a fluid element until crystallization occurs .",
    "however , as we explicitly demonstrate with molecular dynamics simulations , crystallization is accompanied by chemical separation .",
    "the composition of the new solid crust is very different from the remaining liquid ocean .",
    "this changes many properties of the crust and can impact many observables .    with chemical separation , the liquid ocean ,",
    "[ fig0 ] , is greatly enriched in low atomic number @xmath0 elements .",
    "carbon , if present , may be depleted in the crystal ( crust ) and enriched in the liquid ocean phase . also , chemical separation may change the thermal conductivity of the crust and its temperature profile .",
    "indeed some neutron stars are observed to produce energetic x - ray bursts known as superbursts .",
    "these are thought to involve the unstable thermonuclear burning of carbon @xcite .",
    "however it is unclear how the initial carbon concentration is obtained and how the ignition temperature is reached .",
    "chemical separation may significantly change the thickness , shear modulus , and breaking strain of the crust . this could change the shape of a neutron star and the radiation of periodic gravitational waves @xcite @xcite .",
    "furthermore , changes in the crust could change the properties of quasi periodic oscillations that may be observable in thermonuclear bursts .",
    "note that the boundary between the inner and outer crust is not shown.,width=264 ]    the process we consider here is distinct from sedimentation , which may also occur at lower densities where the ions are fluid @xcite .",
    "however , we are not aware of any previous calculations of chemical separation from crystallization for accreting neutron stars .",
    "jones has considered how a range of compositions may change the properties of the crust of a non - accreting neutron star . in ref .",
    "@xcite he considers phase separation , but only based on quite early work on the free energy of the two - component coulomb plasma .",
    "instead , jones suggests that the system will form an amorphous solid @xcite .",
    "the ash resulting from rapid proton capture ( rp process ) nuclear reactions is expected to have a complex composition involving a number of different chemical elements @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it can be difficult to construct the phase diagram for a multi - component system .",
    "the pure one component plasma ( ocp ) phase diagram is well known .",
    "the liquid solidifies when the ratio of a typical coulomb energy to the thermal energy @xmath1 is @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is defined , @xmath4 where the ion charge is @xmath5 , the temperature is @xmath6 , and the ion sphere radius @xmath7 describes a typical distance between ions , @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the ion ( number ) density .",
    "the phase diagram for binary mixtures has also been determined .",
    "see for example @xcite . for binary mixtures ,",
    "the solid phase is enriched in the high @xmath0 ion and the liquid phase is enriched in the low @xmath0 ion .",
    "often , the theoretical phase diagram is constructed from extremely accurate calculations of the free energies of the solid and liquid phases .",
    "the melting point is determined by equating these two free energies .",
    "very accurate calculations are needed because the free energies are nearly parallel as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "a small error in the free energy of one phase can lead to a large error in the melting point .",
    "therefore , it may be very difficult to compute the free energy of multi - component systems with enough accuracy to determine the phase diagram .",
    "instead , in this paper we determine the phase diagram of a multi - component system directly via molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "our simulation volume contains regions of both the liquid and solid phase .",
    "this approach has many advantages .",
    "it is simple and robust .",
    "delicate free energy calculations are not needed .",
    "one can directly measure the composition of the two phases that are in equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , one can run simulations with arbitrarily complicated compositions .    however , there are two limitations to direct molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "first , finite size effects may be significant because a large fraction of the ions are near the interfaces between the two phases .",
    "we minimize finite size effects by using a moderately large number of ions 27,648 and we measure the composition of the two phases in regions that are away from the interfaces .",
    "second , it can take a long time for the two phase system to come into thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we address non equilibrium effects by running for a total simulation time of 151 million fm / c ( over six million md time steps ) and by monitoring the time dependence of the composition of the two phases . still ,",
    "as we discuss below , the system may not be in full equilibrium and this may be an important question for further work . nevertheless , we start with equal compositions and find dramatically different compositions for the liquid and solid , where the difference has increased with simulation time .",
    "if the system is not in equilibrium by the end of our simulation , we expect the difference between liquid and solid to only increase further with time .",
    "therefore , we do not think non - equilibrium effects will change our conclusion that _ the liquid and solid have very different compositions_.    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ mdsimulation ]",
    "we describe our molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "results are presented in section [ results ] and we conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we now describe the initial composition for our simulation .",
    "schatz et al . have calculated the rapid proton capture ( rp ) process of hydrogen burning on the surface of an accreting neutron star @xcite .",
    "this produces a variety of nuclei up to atomic masses @xmath10 .",
    "gupta et al .",
    "@xcite then calculate how the composition of the rp process ash evolves because of electron capture and light particle reactions as the material is buried by further accretion . their final composition , at a density of @xmath11 g/@xmath12 ( near neutron drip at the bottom of the outer crust ) has forty percent of the ions with atomic number @xmath13 , while an additional 10 % have @xmath14 .",
    "the remaining half of the ions have a range of lower @xmath0 from @xmath15 to 32 .",
    "finally there is a small abundance of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    .",
    "the plus symbols show the initial composition of the mixture .",
    "the final compositions of the liquid phase , open green circles , and solid phase , filled red squares , are show after a simulation time of @xmath18 fm / c , see section [ results].,width=264 ]    for simplicity we use the gupta et al .",
    "abundances because we have them available .",
    "however these abundances were calculated assuming no phase separation .",
    "therefore they have not been determined self - consistently if there is phase separation .",
    "nevertheless , we use them to provide a first orientation .",
    "note that we use abundances calculated near @xmath19 g/@xmath12 , while the ocean/ crust boundary may be near @xmath20 g/@xmath12 .",
    "the differences in composition at these two densities may be primarily do to a modest amount of electron capture .",
    "this should not significantly change our results .",
    "perhaps phase separation will lead to more important changes in the abundances .",
    "chemical separation is expected to change compositions over a large range of densities in addition to densities near the ocean/ crust interface .",
    "for example , changes in composition of the liquid , near the crust interface , are expected to diffuse throughout the ocean .",
    "as we discuss in section [ conclusions ] future calculations of abundances including phase separation would be very useful .",
    ".abundance @xmath21 ( by number ) of chemical element @xmath0 .",
    "results are presented for the original mixture and for the final liquid and solid phases after a simulation time of @xmath18 fm / c , see text .",

    "how will chemical separation change the structure of a neutron star ? consider a steady state situation where matter accretes onto a thin ocean while ocean material crystallizes to form new neutron star crust .",
    "we assume the mass of the crust is much larger than that of the ocean . in steady state ,",
    "the rate of crystallization is equal to the accretion rate .",
    "furthermore , let us assume the composition of the crust is uniform .",
    "steady state equilibrium than requires the composition of the crust to be equal to that of the accreting material .",
    "however , the composition of the thin ocean must become significantly enriched in light elements so that this liquid can be in thermodynamic equilibrium with the solid crust .",
    "note that the ocean became enriched in light elements because the first material to crystallize was depleted in light elements .",
    "furthermore , this initial change in composition of the crystallized material will not noticeably change the net composition of the crust because the crust is assumed to be much more massive than the ocean .",
    "we find a significant enrichment of oxygen @xmath15 in the liquid .",
    "our original composition did not include any carbon @xmath22 because gupta et al .",
    "@xcite found the carbon was burned to oxygen .",
    "however if this incorrect and carbon is present , it should also be enriched in the liquid because it has a similar atomic number to oxygen .",
    "therefore carbon could be significantly enriched in the ocean compared to its concentration in either the accreting material or in the crust .",
    "alternatively , carbon may burn , either stably or unstably , before it reaches this phase transition region . in this case , because there is no carbon remaining , it will not be enriched in the liquid .    very energetic type i x - ray bursts known as superbursts @xcite are thought to involve unstable carbon burning .",
    "cumming and bildsten argue that the mass fraction of carbon must be large , @xmath23 , in order for carbon to burn explosively @xcite .",
    "chemical separation , which we find upon crystallization , could possibly change carbon concentrations .",
    "in addition , chemical separation could change the thermal conductivity of the crust .",
    "this will be discussed in later work , and could impact how the ignition temperature is reached for superbursts .",
    "in addition , the release of latent heat and or gravitational potential energy could change the temperature profile of the star .",
    "however , the small latent heat of a pure system , that we found at the beginning of section [ results ] , and the small density difference between our liquid and solid phases suggests that both of these heat sources may be small .",
    "we find a lower melting temperature for our mixture compared to that for a one component plasma .",
    "table [ tablethree ] lists @xmath24 for our liquid phase , compared to a pure one component plasma , that melts near @xmath25 .",
    "presumably this is due to the large range of charges @xmath0 that are present in our liquid phase .",
    "this change in melting point could significantly increase the thickness of the liquid ocean in accreting neutron stars .",
    "if the melting point does occur at @xmath26 , this implies that for accreting neutron stars with typical crust temperature @xmath27 that the density at which crystallization occurs is , @xmath28 for the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 values in table iii .",
    "a rather high density of @xmath32 g/@xmath12 for crystallization may be an order of magnitude higher than the density where @xmath33c fuses .",
    "note that the frequency drifts of oscillations observed during x - ray bursts may be a way to test the depth of the crust/ ocean interface @xcite .",
    "however , we caution that the melting point could change if our simulation is not fully in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the phase diagram for multi - component systems can be very complicated .",
    "for example , an additional new solid phase could form with a lower @xmath0 composition after most of the high @xmath0 ions have solidified .",
    "therefore it is important to study further the melting point of these complex mixtures . in future work",
    "we will also study phase separation for superburst ashes .",
    "our initial composition was not determined in a way that is consistent with chemical separation .",
    "gupta et al",
    ". @xcite calculated how electron capture and light particle reactions change the composition of rp process ash as it is compressed to higher densities .",
    "however , they assumed the composition does not change upon crystallization .",
    "we now find the composition changes significantly .",
    "therefore , one should recalculate electron capture and light particle reactions consistently with chemical separation .",
    "we have calculated results for only one initial composition .",
    "we expect our general result , that the liquid is greatly enriched in low @xmath0 elements , to hold for a variety of different compositions . nevertheless , it is important to study chemical separation for other compositions .",
    "itoh and kohyama find the thermal conductivity of an impure crystal to be proportional to @xmath34 where the impurity parameter @xmath35 is the square of the dispersion in the ion charges@xcite , @xmath36 we find that chemical separation reduces @xmath35 from 38.9 in the original mixture to 22.3 in the solid phase , see table [ tablethree ] .",
    "this is because the solid contains far fewer low @xmath0 ions .",
    "_ therefore , chemical separation may significantly change the thermal conductivity of the crust . _",
    "note that @xmath35 for the liquid phase is also greatly changed .",
    "in future work we will present molecular dynamics simulation results for the static structure factor of both the liquid and solid phases and calculations of the thermal conductivity .    the assumptions , that the composition of the crust is uniform and that the system is in steady state equilibrium , are likely to be oversimplified .",
    "instead the crystallization rate and composition may be time dependent .",
    "chemical separation could lead to the formation of layers in the crust .",
    "there may be bands of high @xmath0 material above or below bands of low @xmath0 material .",
    "this will increase the complexity of the crust and it will likely impact many crust properties .",
    "for example , these layers could decrease the net thermal conductivity and change the temperature profile .",
    "alternatively , if the layers are position dependent and dynamically stable , they could change the mass quadruple moment of the star and enhance the radiation of continuous gravitational waves .",
    "the possibility of layers should be studied in future work .    in conclusion ,",
    "nucleosynthesis on the surface of accreting neutron stars likely produces a range of chemical elements .",
    "we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of crystallization to see how this complex material forms new neutron star crust .",
    "we find chemical separation , with the liquid ocean phase greatly enriched in low atomic number elements compared to the solid crust .",
    "this change in composition can change many crust properties such as the thermal conductivity or shear modulus .",
