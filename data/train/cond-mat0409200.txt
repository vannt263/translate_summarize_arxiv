    "in recent years the experimental method of microrheology  @xcite emerged as a powerful tool to monitor the mechanical properties of viscoelastic soft materials  @xcite especially in biological systems  @xcite including cells   @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to disperse micron - sized beads into the material and monitor their motion either as reponse to external forces ( active method )  @xcite or due to brownian fluctuations ( passive method )  @xcite .",
    "whereas in the first method , the frequency - dependent response function or compliance is measured directly , it is inferred in the second method from the particle s positional fluctuations using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and the kramers - kronig relations  @xcite .    in this article , we address the particles rotational degree of freedom and lay the theoretical basis to use it in microrheology . to monitor the particles orientations",
    ", they have to be anisotropic . and",
    "indeed , first experimental implementations of one - bead microrheology with either birefringent spherial particles  @xcite or microdisks   @xcite do exist .",
    "the main theoretical problem of microrheology is how the particle compliance measured in experiments relates to the viscoelastic properties of the material quantified in its complex shear modulus .",
    "we will show here , based on a model - viscoelastic medium , the so - called two - fluid system  @xcite , that the compliance in the rotational case obeys a generalized stokes law which is only limited by an upper crossover frequency in contrast to the translational motion where the validity is restricted to a frequency window  @xcite .",
    "so one advantage of rotating particles is that they extend the frequency range that allows a straightforward interpretation of the experimental results by the stokes law .",
    "let us first review the reason for the frequency window in the translational case  @xcite . as a model - viscoelastic medium , we consider an elastic component , e.g. , a polymer network , which can move relative to a newtonian fluid .",
    "a particle embedded in this medium experiences an external oscillating force with amplitude @xmath0 and reacts with an oscillating displacement described by the amplitude @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the compliance as a function of frequency @xmath3 . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the displaced particle creates a deformation field in the elastic network which includes both shear and compressional contributions . for small @xmath3 ,",
    "the elastic network thus has to move relative to the incompressible fluid since the latter only allows shear motions .",
    "however , the frictional force between both components increases with their relative speed .",
    "hence , beyond a crossover frequency @xmath5 , elastic network and viscous fluid are strongly coupled and can be considered as a single incompressible viscoelastic medium .",
    "the compliance for a spherical particle then assumes the simple generalized stokes relation @xmath6^{-1}$ ] where @xmath7 is the complex shear modulus , @xmath8 is viscosity and @xmath9 denotes lam s elastic constant associated with shear . beyond a second crossover frequency @xmath10 , inertial effects of the fluid become important and the generalized stokes relation is no longer valid .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by detailed calculations using a `` volume localization '' approximation  @xcite .",
    "in the following , we consider a rotating particle with an oscillating angular displacement @xmath11 where the direction of the vector @xmath12 caracterizes the axis of rotation . since the pressure around the particle stays constant , the oscillating velocity field in a pure incompressible newtonian fluid is described by the helmholtz equation @xmath13 with wave number @xmath14  @xcite . under stick boundary conditions it assumes the form @xmath15 \\frac{1-ikr}{1-ika}e^{ik(r - a ) } \\enspace\\ ] ] which determines the external torque @xmath16 to drive the oscillating particle . for small frequencies ,",
    "the compliance obeys the familiar stokes result , @xmath17 .",
    "deviations from this law , occur around @xmath18 , i.e. , when the penetration depth @xmath19 equals the particle radius @xmath20 .",
    "we now study the equivalent problem for a model viscoelastic medium , represented by a two - fluid model  @xcite : @xmath21 here an incompressible newtonian fluid with shear viscosity @xmath8 is coupled to an elastic medium with lam constants @xmath22 , @xmath9 via a conventional friction term . by dimensional analysis , the friction coefficient @xmath23 contains a characteristic length @xmath24 which is on the order of the mesh size in , e.g. , an actin network  @xcite .",
    "we neglect the mass density of the elastic medium to the one of the newtonian fluid right from the beginning .",
    "the characteristic parameters of the theory are the reduced mesh size @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the two frequencies quantify the fluid inertia , shear elasticity , and shear viscosity .",
    "typical numbers for an actin solution  @xcite are @xmath28 and @xmath29 based on @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "an oscillating rotating particle creates pure shear fields for both displacement @xmath33 and velocity @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and keeps the pressure constant .",
    "one then derives from eqs .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.2 ] ) that the amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the oscillating fields obey a vector helmholtz equation in analogy to the pure newtonian fluid , however with @xmath38 replaced by a matrix @xmath39 . to solve this equation",
    ", we introduce @xmath40 and finally arrive at the equivalent helmholtz equation for @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath43 the reduced radial coordinate is denoted by @xmath44 and the radial part of the laplace operator reads @xmath45 .",
    "the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) is given by @xmath46 or @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the eigenvalues of @xmath39 .",
    "the matrix @xmath49 is composed of the eigenvectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 and therefore diagonalizes @xmath39 .",
    "finally , the constants @xmath52 are determined by the boundary conditions on the surface of the particle . note that the roots @xmath53 have to be chosen such that the exponentials in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) decay to zero for large @xmath54 .    in general , the external torque on a particle",
    "is calculated by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the stress tensor and @xmath57 the directed surface element . in our case , @xmath58 and the velocity @xmath34 and displacement vector @xmath33 point along the azimuthal direction relative to the axis @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , only the respective components of the elastic and viscous stress tensor , @xmath59 contribute and give a torque parallel to @xmath12 with magnitude @xmath60 , where @xmath61\\big )   \\label{8 } \\\\ t^{v } & = & -i\\omega 8\\pi\\eta a^{3 } \\phi(\\omega )   \\big(1-\\frac{1}{3 }   [ s_{21}b_{1}\\lambda_{1}e^{i\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1 } } } +   s_{22}b_{2}\\lambda_{2}e^{i\\sqrt{\\lambda_{2}}}]\\big ) \\enspace .",
    "\\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the prefactors on the right - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) are the stokes results for a pure elastic or viscous medium .    in the following we consider two cases to determine the constants @xmath52 from the boundary conditions . in the first case , we assume stick boundary conditions for both the viscous and the elastic component at the particle surface , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "so we assume that the elastic network is attached to the particle . in the second case ,",
    "the elastic network is not attached and the elastic stress tensor @xmath63 in eqs .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) vanishes on the particle surface . as a result ,",
    "the elastic torque @xmath64 is zero and the displacement field has to fulfill the mixed boundary condition @xmath65 . in both cases",
    "we can write down the solutions in analytic form . however , the concrete formulas are too large to convey direct information .",
    "we therefore discuss their graphic representations and determine certain limits .",
    "in figs .  [ f.1 ] and [ f.2 ] we plot the real and imaginary part of the inverse compliance @xmath66 , relative to their results for a pure elastic and viscous system , as a function of @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; the mesh size is @xmath69 . for low frequencies they both exhibit constant values which correspond to the generalized stokes relation @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "this result can be extracted from our theory as long as the term @xmath72 in the matrix @xmath39 of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) can be neglected against one , i.e. , as long as inertial effects of the fluid are negligible .",
    "note that unlike the translational motion , the validity of the stokes relation extends to @xmath73 ; there is no lower crossover frequency .",
    "the reason is clearly that a rotating sphere only creates pure shear fields for both dynamic variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this indicates that elastic network and viscous fluid are strongly coupled to each other and move together .",
    "therefore , their dynamics is described by the equation of linear elasticity with the complex shear modulus @xmath74 ( reminiscent to a voigt element  @xcite ) or alternatively by the navier - stokes equation with @xmath8 replaced by @xmath75 . with the latter view",
    ", the compliance can be calculated using the result from the newtonian fluid @xcite with a complex wave number given by @xmath76 : @xmath77 the last equation fits the graphs in figs .",
    "[ f.1 ] and [ f.2 ] well .",
    "it especially accounts for the deviations from the stokes law due to inertial effects at higher frequencies . in a pure newtonian fluid",
    ", inertia becomes noticable around the frequency @xmath78 ; just set @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) . for the strongly coupled viscoelastic system ,",
    "the onset of inertial effects is not so clear from eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "we therefore determined the appropriate crossover frequencies empirically by requiring that the compliance @xmath2 deviates from the stokes law by 10% . as it is already obvious from the graphs in figs .",
    "[ f.1 ] and [ f.2 ] , we find that the crossover frequencies exhibit different behavior for the real and imaginary part of @xmath66 . for the real part , it scales as @xmath80 whereas for the imaginary part it behaves as @xmath81 for @xmath82 and passes over to @xmath78 for @xmath83 .",
    "this cross over is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] .",
    "so far , we discussed the case of @xmath84 . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the regime of generalized stokes law still exists but eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) does not apply anymore , although the deviations are not dramatic .",
    "the regime @xmath85 means that the continuum limit can no longer be applied to elastic networks such as actin .",
    "however , in the two - fluid model @xmath24 just quantifies the frictional coupling between fluid and elastic component .",
    "one could wonder if there exists a viscoelastic system with such a weak coupling so that @xmath85 is applicable .",
    "we now address the case where the elastic network is not coupled to the particle surface , it only reacts to shear flow via the friction term in eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] , we plot the real part of the inverse compliance as a function of reduced frequency @xmath67 and mesh size @xmath25 ; the additional parameter is set to @xmath86 . for small frequencies ,",
    "the real part is close to zero , in contrast to case 1 , where it assumes the reference stokes value of @xmath87 , as already discussed . the friction between the two components is sufficiently small so the fluid permeates the elastic network without deforming it noticeably .",
    "then for increasing frequency , an edge occurs and @xmath88 enters the region where the stokes law is valid .",
    "note , however , that this region is considerably reduced compared to case 1 . correspondingly , the imaginary part in fig .  [ f.4 ]",
    "( also in units of @xmath87 ! ) exhibits a ridge .",
    "this is what we roughly expect since real and imaginary part of the compliance are connected via kramers - kronig relations  @xcite .",
    "the features described so far can be explained by the formula @xmath89",
    "\\quad \\mathrm{with } \\quad \\tau = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{e}}\\frac{a}{3\\xi}\\sqrt{1-i\\omega/\\omega_{e } } \\enspace , \\label{11}\\ ] ] which follows from our theory when we neglect again the  inertial term \" @xmath72 in the matrix @xmath39 of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and set @xmath84 . to determine @xmath90 , the complex root with positive real part has to be taken . for @xmath91 , the existence of the edge and ridge in relation  (",
    "[ 11 ] ) are obvious .",
    "furthermore , the relation demonstrates that edge and ridge , or the onset of the stokes regime , occur at a frequency which scales as @xmath25 .",
    "this is in contrast to translational motion where it scales as @xmath92   @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ f.5 ] the imaginary part of @xmath93 with proper scale factor @xmath94 is plotted .",
    "it reveals the strong effect of friction between both components when the fluid permeates the elastic network .",
    "note the logarithmic scale of the vertical axis .",
    "inertial effects for @xmath84 are again described by eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) . so the stokes regime in fig .",
    "[ f.5 ] extends up to @xmath95 in agreement with fig .",
    "nevertheless , we find that in case 2 , the validity of the stokes law is reduced .",
    "based on a two - fluid model , we determined and discussed the compliance for a rotating spherical particle embedded in a viscoelastic medium .",
    "in the case where both the viscous and elastic component obey stick boundary conditions at the particle surface , we identify the validity of a generalized stokes law , and therefore a simple relation to the complex shear modulus , starting from zero frequency and limited only at high frequencies by inertial effects .",
    "this is in contrast to translational motion .",
    "when the elastic network is not coupled to the particle , the compliance exhibits a region of low elasticity and high effective viscosity starting from zero frequency indicating the strong friction which occurs when fluid permeates the elastic network .",
    "the regime of the stokes law is reduced .",
    "real viscoelastic systems such as actin solutions possess a frequency - depended complex shear modulus   @xcite .",
    "so to discuss the frequency dependence of the compliance , e.g. , in case 1 , one has to consider a non - trivial path in figs .  [ f.1 ] and [ f.2 ] determined by the varying parameter @xmath96 .",
    "this is , however , no problem in the stokes regime but leads to additional effects outside the stokes regime as , e.g. , in case 2 .",
    "our study of different boundary conditions clarifies that the interpretation of compliances measured in experiment needs care .",
    "so far , in the translational case , always stick - boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "our results show that some slip of the elastic network changes the measurable compliance dramatically .",
    "this could lead to false interpretations .",
    "clearly , one - bead microrheology with rotating particles also suffers the drawback that it does not probe bulk properties , as it is done with two - bead methods  @xcite . on the other hand , since in the stokes regime the shear fields decay as @xmath97 instead of @xmath98 for translational motion , the method could be used to monitor explicitely the effect of the embedded particle on the elastic network  @xcite .",
    "a challenge will be to develop the theory for two - bead microrheology including the rotational degree of freedom  @xcite .    in this article we laid the theoretical basis for microrheology with rotating particles .",
    "our results demonstrate that it can be a useful extension of existing methods based on translational motion and also complements them .",
    "so we hope that our work stimulates further experimental investigations which use rotating particles as colloidal probes to explore the mechanical properties of soft materials , especially in connection with biological systems .",
