    "detailed optical work with 4m - class ground - based telescopes and the hubble space telescope on individual blue supergiants has been carried out in recent years in the galaxy , the magellanic clouds and a handful of nearby galaxies , most notably m31 and m33 @xcite .",
    "these stars are extremely luminous ( up to @xmath3 ) and show signatures of strong mass outflows in their ultraviolet , optical and infrared spectra , which are successfully interpreted in the framework of the radiation driven wind theory @xcite .",
    "one of the main predictions of the theory , nicely confirmed by spectral diagnostics of supergiants in the milky way @xcite , magellanic clouds @xcite , ngc  6822 ( muschielok et al .",
    "1999 ) , m31 @xcite , and m33 @xcite , is a tight relationship between the modified wind momentum ( the product of mass - loss rate , terminal velocity of the winds and square root of stellar radius ) and the stellar luminosity :    @xmath4    with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this _ wind momentum - luminosity relationship _ ( wlr ) has a great potential as a new , independent extragalactic distance indicator .",
    "kudritzki et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimate that using the wlr technique with ten to twenty a - supergiants per galaxy and medium resolution spectroscopy with 8 m telescopes from the ground distance moduli with an accuracy of about 0.1 mag can be obtained out to the virgo and fornax clusters of galaxies . a detailed comparison with well - known primary distance indicators is now required in order to establish the reliability and applicability of the wlr . in this context",
    "we have set to apply the methods of quantitative spectroscopy to a and b supergiants in galaxies with known , mostly cepheid - based , distances . among the galaxies studied within the hst extragalactic distance scale key project ( kennicutt , freedman & mould 1995 , @xcite ) , ngc  3621 has been chosen for its moderate distance ( 40% that of the virgo cluster ) , maximizing our chances of detecting blue supergiants . in this letter",
    "we discuss the identification of suitable targets and the testing of our spectroscopic tools with the current observational capabilities of an 8 m telescope .",
    "for the spectroscopic target selection we obtained broad - band @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 ccd frames of ngc  3621 with antu , the first unit of the very large telescope ( vlt ) operated by the european southern observatory on cerro paranal , equipped with fors ( focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph ) in imaging mode .",
    "the crowded - field photometry was carried out with the iraf version of daophot ( @xcite ) , and indicates that the brightest stellar objects in this galaxy appear at @xmath8 , corresponding approximately to an absolute magnitude @xmath3 , given the cepheid distance modulus @xmath9 ( @xmath100.2 ) and average reddening @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we selected isolated stars brighter than @xmath12 and with color index @xmath13 , corresponding to the expected location of reddened blue supergiants in the colour  magnitude diagram .",
    "the target selection was finalized after inspection of archival hst wfpc2 images of a smaller field in ngc  3621 ( to avoid , where possible , contamination by neighbouring stars in our spectra ) , and rejection of objects showing nebular emission on top of stellar features , as revealed by short exposure spectra obtained during the commissioning phase of fors2 at the second unit telescope of the vlt .",
    "two h  ii regions ( one of which located within a slit together with a stellar object ) were included in the final sample , for future comparison of chemical abundances measured independently from stellar and nebular lines .",
    "optical spectra of our candidates were obtained on march 1 - 2 , 2000 , under 0.8 arcsec seeing conditions .",
    "the fors instrument possesses excellent multiplexing capabilities , allowing spectra of 19 different faint objects to be taken simultaneously through separate slitlets , each approximately 20 arcsec in length .",
    "[ galaxy ] shows the distribution of the targets , and table  1 summarizes their position and photometric data .",
    "several exposures , adding up to a total integration time of 10.7 hours , were obtained with a single multislit setup ( 600 gr / mm grism , 1 arcsec slits ) , covering as a minimum the 3,8004,900    wavelength range at 5   resolution .",
    "this range contains most of the spectral features useful for deriving the main stellar parameters ( effective temperature , gravity and chemical composition ) .",
    "the photometric selection proved to be rather successful .",
    "we have identified in our spectra ten supergiants , subdivided into spectral types as follows : b ( one star ) , a ( six ) , f ( one ) , and two luminous blue variable ( lbv ) candidates . of the remaining targets ,",
    "four have composite spectra , while four show nebular emission superposed on stellar features , despite our efforts to avoid such occurrences . in fig .  [ spectra ]",
    "one early a - supergiant ( @xmath14 ) , one early f - supergiant ( @xmath15 ) and one lbv candidate ( @xmath16 ) are displayed .",
    "the quality of the extracted spectra ( with a s / n ratio of order 50 ) is excellent , making the classification of spectral types using galactic standard stars , together with a first estimate of effective temperatures , straightforward .",
    "using line - blanketed model atmospheres in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite and detailed nlte / lte line formation calculations @xcite a quantitative analysis of the spectra is possible .",
    "we concentrate here on the object at the top in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ( hereafter star @xmath14 ) , for which we estimate an effective temperature t@xmath17=9000@xmath10400  k from the spectral classification and subsequently derive a gravity @xmath18=1.05@xmath100.15 ( cgs ) from fitting the higher balmer series members ( from h@xmath19 upward ) . a microturbulent velocity typical for luminous supergiants , @xmath20=8  km  s@xmath21 , is chosen for the spectrum synthesis calculations . a more detailed analysis comprising the remaining objects",
    "will be published elsewhere .",
    "the spectrum is well fit with a chemical composition comparable to that of the large magellanic cloud assuming a reduction of metallicity by a factor of two with respect to solar composition ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "[ slit9 ] ) , while a significantly lower metallicity , as found in the small magellanic cloud ( 0.2 solar ) , can confidently be ruled out .",
    "previous work using the emission lines of h  ii regions close to our stellar target has found a reduction of the oxygen abundance of the same order @xcite .",
    "our analysis provides additional information concerning elements such as magnesium , iron , chromium and titanium .",
    "it is important to note that the spectral resolution of 5 allows a reasonable estimate of stellar metallicity by synthesizing the entire observed spectrum .",
    "we have tested this technique by reproducing the results obtained by detailed quantitative analyses of high resolution , high s / n spectra of local group a - supergiants ( przybilla , 2001 , in prep . ) .",
    "however , we stress that it is difficult to determine precise effective temperatures from ionization equilibria of weak lines and microturbulence velocities and abundances from individual lines . here",
    "we have to rely on the experience obtained from the analyses of local group objects using higher resolution spectra . in the next phase",
    "we intend to work at a resolution of 2 as provided , for instance , by fors 2 at the vlt .",
    "we determined the interstellar reddening by fitting the calculated energy distribution to the fluxes corresponding to the measured magnitudes .",
    "a total @xmath0 is found , consistent with most , if not all , of the effect as being due to galactic foreground reddening @xcite .",
    "this value is smaller than the one obtained by the hst key project @xmath22 , rawson et al .",
    "1997 ) , however their wfpc2 field is closer to the central part of the galaxy , where dust lanes are prominent ( fig .",
    "[ galaxy ] ) .",
    "we therefore demonstrate that , in principle , stellar spectroscopy allows us to map interstellar extinction for accurate distance determinations . from the cepheid distance modulus and an interstellar extinction",
    "@xmath1 we derive an absolute magnitude @xmath23 ( @xmath100.2 ) for our object .",
    "the corresponding stellar radius , calculated from the model atmosphere flux in the @xmath2 filter , is @xmath24 , yielding a luminosity @xmath25 .",
    "star @xmath14 , with its very high luminosity , is the ideal target for testing whether it is possible to measure wind momenta of a - supergiants in galaxies far beyond the local group .",
    "mass - loss rates @xmath26 and terminal velocities @xmath27 are usually determined from the shape of the h@xmath28 stellar wind line profile . however , because of the enormous strength of the wind driven by the luminosity , also h@xmath29 is affected by mass - loss , which allows a first estimate of the stellar wind momentum . as in previous work in the milky way @xcite and m31 @xcite we adopt `` unified model atmospheres '' , which allow for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "are spherically extended and include the hydrodynamic effects of stellar winds in their stratification ( santolaya - rey , puls & herrero 1997 ) .",
    "the calculated h@xmath29 profiles in fig .",
    "[ wlr ] show very clearly how mass - loss affects the profile shape .",
    "the absorption profile is significantly filled by wind emission , enabling a reasonable determination of @xmath26 . since ,",
    "contrary to h@xmath28 , the h@xmath29 fit does not allow the direct determination of terminal velocities , we adopt a typical value @xmath27 = 200 km / s . comparing with other a - supergiants @xcite",
    "the uncertainty introduced by this assumption is of the order of 20% .",
    "the mass - loss of the a - supergiant obtained in this way is @xmath30  yr@xmath21 , while the corresponding modified stellar wind momentum flow is @xmath31 erg cm@xmath21 , with an accuracy of roughly 30% .    fig .",
    "[ wlr ] compares with the wlr for galactic and m31 supergiants of solar metallicity , for which we have adopted the stellar parameters given by venn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , kudritzki et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and mccarthy et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , together with a more recent distance determination to m31 equal to 783 kpc ( holland 1998 ) , and a revised photometry for the m31 supergiants ( venn et al",
    ". 2000a ) .",
    "because of the small bolometric corrections of a - supergiants we use absolute magnitude rather than luminosity to display the relationship .",
    "star @xmath14 is located slightly below the regression line .",
    "a natural explanation for this is the somewhat lower metallicity inferred from the analysis of the photospheric spectrum , which leads to lower wind momenta @xcite .",
    "an empirical calibration of the wlr metallicity dependence using a - supergiants in the magellanic clouds is presently under way .",
    "the slight discrepancy might also be due to the uncertainty of the h@xmath29 fit .",
    "the forthcoming vlt observations of all of our targets at h@xmath28 wavelengths will allow us to answer this question and to put additional data points onto the wlr - plane .",
    "we are confident that this will also provide an independent constraint on the distance of ngc  3621 .",
