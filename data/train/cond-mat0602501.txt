    "the control of the flow of light using photonic band - gap ( pbg ) materials has received considerable attention over the past decade @xcite . moreover , the potential for using artificially structured `` metamaterials '' , such as the recently discovered `` left - handed media '' @xcite , has shown considerable technological promise . in the past",
    ", significant progress has been achieved in the field of photonics by making use of analogies with electronic systems .",
    "for instance , the typical pbg material , a system with a spatially varying and periodic dielectric function , was motivated by the well known physics of electronic bloch states ; the dielectric scattering of light in periodic media presents the same formal solutions as those for the scattering of electrons in periodic potentials .",
    "previous photonic bandstructure calculations have focused on the frequency dispersion of the photon bands ; it has been usually been assumed that a knowledge of the spectrum alone represents a complete understanding of dynamics of the system .",
    "a primary goal of such calculations has been the quest for a pbg material with a complete bandgap throughout the brillouin zone in some frequency range , which would prevent the transmission of light with frequency in the range of the band gap . both two and three",
    "dimensional bandstructures possessing these properties have now been discovered @xcite .",
    "recently , however , in the study of electronic systems , it has become apparent that , even in the absence of interaction effects , the dispersion relations of the energy bands do not fully characterize the semiclassical dynamics of wavepackets , unless both spatial inversion symmetry and time - reversal symmetry are unbroken@xcite . the additional information , which is not obtainable from knowledge of the energy bands @xmath0 alone , is the variation of the berry curvature@xcite @xmath1 = @xmath2 , which is an antisymmetric tensor in @xmath3-space , where @xmath4 is analogous to a `` magnetic field '' ( flux density ) in @xmath3-space .",
    "the `` berry curvature '' in @xmath3-space is related to the berry phase@xcite in the same way that the bohm - aharonov phase of an electronic wavepacket is related to the magnetic flux density in real space .",
    "while the uniform propagation of wavepackets in perfectly translationally - invariant systems does not involve the berry curvature , the `` semiclassical '' description of the _ acceleration _ of wavepackets in media with spatial inhomogeneity of lengthscales large compared to the underlying lattice spacing is incomplete if it is not taken into account .",
    "recently onoda _",
    "et al._@xcite have pointed out the role of berry curvature in photonic crystals without inversion symmetry ; while these authors characterize this as a `` hall effect of light '' , the hall effect in electronic systems is associated with broken _ time - reversal symmetry _ rather than broken spatial inversion symmetry , and we have recently discussed@xcite some of the at - first - sight - surprising effects that broken time - reversal symmetry could produce in photonic systems .    in the presence of non - vanishing berry curvature , the usual `` semiclassical '' expression for the group velocity of the wavepacket",
    "is supplemented by an additional `` anomalous '' contribution proportional to its acceleration and the local berry curvature of the bloch band .",
    "( the semiclassical treatment of electron dynamics becomes ray optics in the photonic context ) .",
    "this `` anomalous velocity '' has played an important role in understanding recent experiments on the anomalous hall effect of ferromagnets @xcite , for example .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable among the `` exotic '' effects associated with berry curvature , however , is the quantum hall effect @xcite , which has been the focus of intensive experimental and theoretical study in condensed matter physics for over two decades .",
    "the physics of the quantum hall regime and its connection with berry curvature phenomena is now well understood .",
    "the possibility of transcribing some of the main features of the quantum hall effect to photonic systems , which brings into play new possibilities in photonics , is the topic of this paper .",
    "specifically , we shall concern ourselves with analogs of `` chiral '' ( unidirectional ) quantum hall edge states in photonic systems with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the quantum hall effect is usually associated with two dimensional electron systems in semiconductor heterojunctions in strong applied magnetic fields . by treating the plane of the heterojunction as a featureless two - dimensional ( 2d ) continuum , and considering the quantum mechanical motion of electrons in the presence of a magnetic field , one obtains the electronic landau levels .",
    "the key feature giving rise to the quantization of the hall conductance is the incompressibility of the electron fluid : either due to the pauli principle at integer landau level fillings , with the spectral gap to the next empty level given by the cyclotron frequency , or when a gap opens due to strong electron - electron interactions at fractional fillings@xcite .    while in the experimentally - realized systems ,",
    "the quantum hall effect derives from a strong uniform component of magnetic flux density normal to the 2d plane in which the electrons move , the integer quantum hall effect can also in principle derive from the interplay of a periodic bandstructure with a magnetic field .",
    "externally applied in periodic structures give rise to the celebrated hofstadter model of bloch bands with an elegant fractal spectral structure depending on the rational value of the magnetic flux through the unit cell @xcite @xcite .",
    "the influence of the lattice on the quantum hall effect was further investigated in an important paper by thouless et al ( tknn ) @xcite , who discovered a topological invariant of 2d bandstructures known as the `` chern number '' a quantity that was later interpreted in terms of berry curvature @xcite .    at first sight",
    ", it seems implausible that any of the phenomena associated with the quantum hall effect can be transcribed to photonics .",
    "incompressibility and landau level quantization require fermions and charged particles , respectively , and it is not clear how one could introduce an effect similar to the lorentz force due to a magnetic field on a system of neutral bosons . however , a hint that possible analogs could exist in photonics , comes from the fact that a `` zero - field '' quantum hall effect _ without any net magnetic flux density _ ( and hence without landau levels ) could occur in systems consisting of `` simple '' bloch states with broken time - reversal symmetry , as was shown some time ago by one of us @xcite .",
    "the explicit `` graphene - like '' model investigated in ref .",
    "exploits the topological properties of bloch states , which motivated us to construct its photonic counterpart .",
    "this model has also turned out to be a very useful for modeling the anomalous hall effect in ferromagnetic metals @xcite , and a recently proposed `` quantum spin hall effect''@xcite .    while incompressibility of the fluid in the bulk quantizes the hall conductance , perhaps the most remarkable feature of quantum hall systems is the presence of zero energy excitations along the _ edge _ of a finite system . in these edge states ,",
    "electrons travel along a single direction : this `` one - way '' propagation is a symptom of broken time - reversal symmetry . in the case that the integer quantum hall effect is exhibited by bloch electrons , as in the hofstadter problem studied by tknn@xcite , it is related to the topological chern invariant of the one - particle bands and therefore",
    ". the edge states necessarily occur at the interface between bulk regions in which there is a gap at the fermi energy , which have different values of the sum of the chern invariants of the fully occupied bands below the fermi level . while the integer quantum hall effect in such a system itself involves the filling of these bands according to the pauli principle , and",
    "hence is essentially fermionic in nature , the existence of the edge states is a property of the one - electron band structure , without reference to the pauli principle , which suggests that this feature is not restricted to fermionic systems .",
    "we have found that they indeed have a direct photonic counterpart , and this leads to the idea that topologically non - trivial _ unidirectionally propagating photon modes _ can occur along domain walls separating two pbg regions having different chern invariants of bands below the band gap frequency . in this paper , we present the formal basis of such modes , along with explicit numerical examples , simple model hamiltonians , and semiclassical calculations confirming the concept .",
    "we note finally , that while berry phases are usually associated with quantum mechanical interference it can in principle occur wherever phase interference phenomena exist and are governed by hermitian eigenvalue problems , as in the case of classical electromagnetic waves in loss - free media .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the basic formalism of the maxwell normal mode problem in periodic , loss - free media , discuss the berry curvature of the photonic bandstructure problem , and consider the effects of broken time - reversal symmetry . in section iii , we provide explicit numerical examples of bandstructures containing non - trivial topological properties , and show the occurrence of edge states along domain wall configurations .",
    "motivated by the numerical results , in section iv , we derive a simple dirac hamiltonian from the maxwell equations using symmetry arguments as the guiding principle , and we show how under certain conditions the _ zero modes _ of this dirac hamiltonian exhibit anomalous currents along a single direction due to the breaking of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "it is these zero modes that play the role of the `` gapless '' edge excitations , as we shall consider in detail .",
    "section v contains semiclassical analysis , and we end with a discussion and point out possible future directions in section vi .",
    "in this section , we discuss the formal basis of berry curvature in the photon band problem .",
    "we begin with the basic formulation of the photonic bandstructure problem , which is somewhat more complicated than the electronic counterpart , due to the frequency response of dielectric media .",
    "we then briefly review the connection between chern numbers , berry curvature , and the occurrence of gapless edge modes along the boundary where chern numbers of a given band change .",
    "we will be solving the source - free maxwell equations for propagating electromagnetic wave solutions in linear , loss - free media , and will ignore absorption , nonlinear photon - photon interactions , and other processes which do not conserve photon number .",
    "we also assume that the constitutive relations , reflecting the response of the media to the electromagnetic waves , are given by local , but spatially varying tensors with generalized frequency dependence .",
    "the berry phase , and the associated berry curvature , are commonly identified with quantum mechanics , but in fact are more generally associated with the adiabatic variation of the complex eigenvectors of a hermitian eigenvalue system as the hermitian matrix is varied .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "this hermitian eigenvalue problem is the time - independent schrdinger equation ; in the photonic context , it is the classical eigenvalue equation for the normal modes of the maxwell equations . in order to make the correspondence to the standard quantum - mechanical formulation of berry curvature clearer",
    ", we will use a somewhat unfamiliar hamiltonian formulation of maxwell s equations , which is appropriate for loss - free linear media .",
    "however , we should emphasize that that our results are in no way dependent on the use of such a formalism , and are properties of the maxwell equations , however they are written .",
    "in such a loss - free , linear medium , the coupling of electromagnetic modes having different frequencies can be ignored , and the electromagnetic fields and flux densities @xmath5 , @xmath6 will be of the form @xmath7 where the quantities @xmath8 are in general complex - valued functions of position and frequency with the property : @xmath9 the dynamics of these fields are governed by the source - free maxwell equations : @xmath10    consider a single normal mode @xmath11 propagating at frequency @xmath12 . for the moment , ignore any internal polarization or magnetization modes of the medium , and assume instantaneous , frequency - independent response of the dielectric material . in this limit ,",
    "the permeability and permittivity tensors , defined by the relations @xmath13 are both positive - definite hermitian tensors and have well - defined , positive definite hermitian inverses @xmath14 , @xmath15 . since we have assumed a linear , loss - free medium in which photon number is conserved , it is convenient to work with a hamiltonian formalism : the time - averaged energy density of the electromagnetic radiation field is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 then , if @xmath18 is the spatial integral of the energy density , the fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 are given by its functional derivatives with respect to the divergence - free flux densities @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 : @xmath23 in the local hamiltonian formalism , the flux density fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the fundamental degrees of freedom , and they obey the following non - canonical poisson bracket relations : @xmath26 this poisson bracket generates the faraday - maxwell equations d([faraday ] ) : @xmath27 note that these equations do _ not _ generate the gauss law equations ( [ gauss ] ) , but merely ensure that any divergences @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants of the motion ; the gauss laws are additional constraints that are compatible with the faraday - maxwell equations of motion .    if internal polarization and magnetization modes of the medium are ignored , a discretized form of the electromagnetic hamiltonian is formally identical in structure to that of a collection of real oscillator variables @xmath30 with non - canonical poisson brackets @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a real antisymmetric matrix , and the hamiltonian energy function is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a real - symmetric positive - definite matrix .",
    "it is useful to introduce the imaginary antisymmetric hermitian matrix @xmath35 = @xmath36 ; the canonical normal modes are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an arbitrary scale factor , and where @xmath39 = @xmath40 , @xmath41 = @xmath42 , which obeys the generalized hermitian eigenvalue equation @xmath43 with @xmath44 , and the orthogonality condition @xmath45 because of the antisymmetric hermitian property of the matrix @xmath35 , and the positive - definite real - symmetric property of the matrix @xmath34 , this eigenproblem has real eigenvalues that either come in pairs , @xmath46 , or vanish ; these equations provide a straightforward transformation to canonical form only if the generalized eigenvalue problem has no zero - frequency eigenvalues , which is only the case if @xmath35 is non - singular .",
    "the coefficients @xmath47 are the analogs of the electromagnetic fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is also useful to introduce the conjugate quantities @xmath50 these are the analogs of the flux densities @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and @xmath34 encodes the `` constitutive relations '' between analogs of fluxes and fields .",
    "the hamiltonian formulation of the maxwell equations indeed presents the difficulty of having a null space of zero - frequency eigenvalues : by themselves , the faraday - maxwell equations have static ( zero - frequency ) solutions @xmath53 = @xmath54 , @xmath55 = @xmath56 ; the role of the additional gauss law constraints is precisely to eliminate these zero modes .",
    "the zero - mode problem in the hamiltonian formulation is the counterpart of the gauge ambiguity of the solutions of maxwell s equations in the lagrangian formulation .    in the maxwell equations",
    ", @xmath34 becomes the following positive - definite @xmath57 hermitian matrix , @xmath58 more precisely , this a @xmath57 block of an infinite - dimensional `` matrix '' that is block - diagonal in terms of the spatial coordinate @xmath59 .",
    "( the `` @xmath60 '' and `` @xmath61 '' matrix notation is common in the context of generalized hermitian eigenvalue problems , where the positive - definite character of the `` @xmath61 '' matrix guarantees reality of the eigenvalues ; hopefully the context should distinguish our use of the symbol @xmath61 for such a matrix from the symbol @xmath25 used for the magnetic flux density . ) in this continuum limit , the antisymmetric hermitian matrix @xmath35 becomes a @xmath62 matrix block of differential operators : @xmath63 this @xmath60-matrix can be also be elegantly expressed using the @xmath64 spin-1 matrix representations of the angular momentum algebra , @xmath65 : @xmath66    from the antisymmetry of a , it again follows that its eigenvalues come either in @xmath42 pairs , or are zero modes , corresponding to static field configurations . due to the presence of a huge band of zero modes ( one third of the spectrum )",
    ", the @xmath60 matrix can not be written in canonical form .    using the poisson - brackets",

    "however , there is one further conceptual ingredient that needs to be added to the formalism before we can discuss the maxwell normal modes in `` non - reciprocal '' media which have broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the formalism discussed so far treats the constitutive relations as static . in general , although we will treat them as spatially local , we can not also treat them as instantaneous , and must in principle treat the local permittivity and permeability tensors as frequency - dependent , @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 , @xmath74 @xmath72 @xmath75 .",
    "this is because a non - dissipative time - reversal - symmetry breaking component of these tensors is both imaginary and antisymmetric ( as opposed to real symmetric ) _ and _ is an odd function of frequency , making frequency - dependence inescapable in principle .",
    "these effects can on the one hand be treated in a hamiltonian formulation by adding extra local harmonic oscillator modes representing local polarization and magnetization degrees of freedom of the medium that couple to the electromagnetic fields .",
    "the full description of this is again a set of harmonic oscillator degrees of freedom described by equations of the form ( [ discrete ] ) . on the other hand , with the assumption that we are treating the electromagnetic modes in a frequency range that is not resonant with any internal modes of the medium ( _ i.e. _ , in a frequency range where the loss - free condition is satisfied )",
    ", we can eliminate the internal modes to yield a purely - electromagnetic description , but with frequency dependent constitutive relations .",
    "the details are given in appendix [ app1 ] , but the result can be simply stated . if all oscillator degrees of freedom are explicitly described , the eigenvalue problem for the normal modes has the structure ( [ discrete ] ) , where @xmath76 is positive - definite and real - symmetric .",
    "this guarantees that the eigenvalues @xmath12 are real .",
    "however , the normal modes in some positive frequency range @xmath77 can be treated by eliminating modes with natural frequencies outside that range , to give an matrix - eigenvalue - like problem of much smaller rank of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is now a frequency - dependent matrix with a kramers - krnig structure .",
    "the matrix @xmath79 is no longer in general real - symmetric , but provided the eliminated modes are not resonant in the specified frequency range",
    "it instead is generically complex hermitian .",
    "the `` eigenvalue equation '' is now a self - consistent equation : @xmath80 this must be solved by varying @xmath81 till it coincides with an eigenvalue .",
    "unfortunately , while @xmath82 is hermitian and non - singular in the dissipationless frequency range @xmath83 , it is _ not _ necessarily positive definite , so _ a priori _ , the eigenvalues @xmath84 are not guaranteed to be real , except for the fact that we know that these equations were derived from a standard frequency - independent eigenvalue problem which does have real eigenvalues . as shown in appendix [ app1 ] , the kramer - krnig structure of @xmath79 reflects the stability of the underlying full oscillator system , giving the condition that a modified matrix @xmath85 _ is _ positive - definite hermitian in the specified frequency range , which is sufficient to guarantee reality of the eigenvalues in that range .",
    "furthermore , the quadratic expression for the energy of a normal mode solution is given in terms of @xmath86 rather than @xmath87 , reflecting the fact that the total energy of the mode resides in both the explicitly - retained degrees of freedom ( the `` electromagnetic fields '' ) and the those which have been `` integrated out '' ( the non - resonant polarization and magnetization modes of the medium ) : @xmath88    if the frequency dependence of the positive - definite hermitian matrix @xmath89 is negligible in the range @xmath83 , so @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 , with @xmath92 = @xmath93 , one can replace @xmath82 in ( [ selfcon ] ) by the positive - definite frequency - independent hermitian matrix @xmath94 .",
    "this in turn allows the eigenvalue problem to be transformed into the standard hermitian eigenvalue problem @xmath95 with scalar product @xmath96 valid for positive @xmath12 in the frequency range where @xmath89 @xmath90@xmath97 , with @xmath98 and @xmath99 this allows well - known berry - curvature formulas from the standard hermitian eigenproblem @xcite to be quickly translated into the generalized problem .",
    "it turns out that when the full problem with frequency - dependent constitutive relations is treated , the standard formula for the _ berry connection _ remains correct with the simple replacement @xmath91 @xmath72 @xmath100 ( the berry curvature and berry phase can both be expressed in terms of this berry connection ) .",
    "let @xmath101 be a family of complex hermitian matrices defined on a manifold parameterized by a set @xmath102 of independent coordinates @xmath103 , @xmath104 = @xmath105 it is assumed that the matrix is generic , so its eigenvalues are all distinct ; as it is well known , three independent parameters must be `` fine - tuned '' to produce a `` accidental degeneracy '' between a pair of eigenvalues .",
    "thus if the parametric variation of the hermitian matrix is confined to a two - parameter submanifold , each eigenvalue @xmath106 will generically remain distinct .",
    "under these circumstances , the corresponding eigenvector is fully defined by the eigenvalue equation and normalization condition , up to multiplication by a unimodular phase factor , that can vary on the manifold : @xmath107 this is the well - known `` @xmath108 gauge ambiguity '' of the complex hermitian eigenproblem . associated with each eigenvector",
    "is a gauge - field ( vector potential in the parameter space ) , called the `` berry connection '' : @xmath109    this field on the manifold is gauge - dependent , like the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath110 , but its curvature ( the `` berry curvature '' ) , the analog of the magnetic flux density @xmath25 = @xmath111 , is gauge invariant and given by @xmath112 the berry phase associated with a closed path @xmath113 in parameter space is given ( modulo @xmath114 ) by @xmath115 .    ignoring frequency - dependence , the oscillator system has @xmath116 where the positive - definite hermitian matrix @xmath117 can continuously vary as a function of some parameters @xmath102 , but @xmath118 is invariant .",
    "then converting to the oscillator variables gives @xmath119 here @xmath120 has been replaced by @xmath121 which is the correct result when frequency dependence of @xmath122 is taken into account ( see appendix [ app1 ] ) .      in the case of periodic systems ,",

    "when @xmath169 is non - zero , the phases of the bloch vectors can not all be chosen to be real .",
    "these properties will be crucial when we consider the effects of various symmetry breaking perturbations on the photon band structure .",
    "the main consequence of having bands with non - zero berry curvature field is that if the path c is closed and encloses an entire brillouin zone , the single - valuedness of the state @xmath163 requires that @xmath170 or ,    @xmath171    where @xmath172 is an integer , known as the _ chern invariant _ associated with the nth band , and have well - known consequences in the quantum hall effect : in the integer quantum hall effect , where the interactions among electrons are weak , the hall conductance is expressed in terms of the sum of all chern invariants of bands below the fermi level @xcite :    @xmath173    the gauge structure of the photon band problem outlined above is formally analogous to the local @xmath108 gauge invariance of ordinary electromagnetism .",
    "note that the gauge invariance refers to the phase of the of the six - component electromagnetic fields as a whole ; adding arbitrary phase @xmath126-dependent phase factors to each field separately will in general not preserve the maxwell equation constraint .",

    "local gauge transformations correspond to local smooth deformations of the rotor variables , and the chern invariant corresponds to the total winding number of theses rotor variables along a closed path enclosing the entire brillouin zone .",
    "in the case of two dimensional bloch bands , the defects of the phase field are point singularities , having a zero - dimensional `` core '' region where a phase convention is not well defined , due to quasi - degeneracies with neighboring bands .",
    "it is clear that bands can have non - zero chern numbers only if time - reversal symmetry is broken .",

    "however , the connection between _ edge modes _ and chern invariants is independent of statistics : if the chern number of a band changes at an interface , the net number of unidirectionally moving modes localized at the interface is given by the _ difference _ of the chern numbers of the band at the interface .",
    "we shall consider the problem of how chern numbers can change across an interface in the next section .",

    "we choose hexagonal lattice geometry .",
    "the threefold rotation symmetry of such a system guarantees the existence of dirac points in the brillouin zone corners when both inversion and time - reversal symmetry are _ present _ ; in this case the only irreducible representations of the space group of three - fold rotations correspond to non - degenerate singlets and degenerate doublets . as a simple example consider the case of free photon `` bands '' with dispersion @xmath181 in the first brillouin zone of a triangular lattice .",
    "the eigenfrequencies of the photons are six - fold degenerate at the zone corners . adding a weak periodic perturbation in the constitutive relations will lift the degeneracy and the bands",

    "we shall provide explicit examples of hexagonal photonic bandstructures having dirac points in section v.    while the existence of such dirac points are virtually guaranteed in triangular lattice systems , their _ stability _ has little to do with lattice geometry .",
    "such points are stable in two dimensions only because of the presence of time - reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry , when the eigenvalue problem is a real - symmetric one : in this case it is possible to find `` accidental '' degeneracies by varying just two parameters , according to the wigner - von neumann theorem .",
    "thus , if the perfect hexagonal geometry of the constitutive relations is slightly distorted , the dirac points will simply move elsewhere in the two dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "provided that such distortions are not too strong such that an axis of two - fold rotations is introduced , in which case the linear dispersion characteristic of a dirac point is no longer allowed , or if the distortion is so great that the dirac points meet and annihilate at a point of inversion symmetry , dirac points will still exist in the system .",
    "if , however , inversion or time - reversal symmetry is broken in the system , the eigenvalue problem becomes complex hermitian , and according to the wigner - von neumann theorem , three parameters are required to ensure stability of the dirac points - in this case , the dirac point degeneracy of the 2d bandstructure is immediately lifted . in both cases , the two bands which split apart",

    "while the bands do have interesting semiclassical dynamics due to their anomalous velocity , they do not have any interesting topological properties since their chern invariants are identically zero .",
    "on the other hand , if time - reversal symmetry alone is broken , via the faraday coupling , the berry curvature field will be an @xmath183 function of @xmath126 , and each band which split apart due to the faraday coupling will have equal and opposite non - zero chern invariants .    finally , if we can slowly tune the faraday coupling in _ space _",

    "it then follows , that modes with exact correspondence to the integer quantum hall edge states would arise in such a system . in the following section",

    "the two dirac points are related by inversion in k - space .",
    "as we have discussed , a gap immediately opens when either inversion or time - reversal symmetries are broken in this system .",
    "we break inversion symmetry in the simplest possible way by introducing a slight imbalance in the value of the dielectric tensor in the rods at opposite ends of the unit cell , and we parameterize the inversion breaking by defining the quantity    @xmath190    where @xmath191 is the value of the permittivity inside the rods in the upper ( lower ) half of the unit cell depicted in fig .",
    "[ band ] .    to break time - reversal symmetry , we add a faraday effect term in the region outside the rods .",

    "the boundary between these phases are where the gap at one or more of the dirac points vanishes , as shown in fig .",
    "since there are two dirac points , each phase boundary corresponds to the locus of parameters for which the gap at one of the dirac points closes .",
    "thus , both dirac points close only when both lines intersect , namely at the point @xmath196 , where both inversion and time - reversal symmetries are simultaneously present . when inversion symmetry alone is broken , the berry curvature field of dirac point 1 is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign of the berry curvature at the second dirac point .",
    "when time - reversal symmetry is broken , on the other hand , each dirac point has an identical ( both in magnitude and sign ) berry curvature field . in this case , the photon bands which split apart at the dirac point each have non - zero chern number , which depends only on the direction of the faraday axis ( @xmath197 ) .",
    ".,width=326 ]    we have also studied numerically the frequency gap as a function of the time - reversal breaking perturbation above and found that so long as the dielectric tensor remains positive - definite , the gap increases linearly with @xmath198 ( [ gap ] ) .",
    "this will be important when we consider effective dirac hamiltonians for this problem : as we shall see , the fact that exactly at the zone corner , the gap rises linearly with @xmath199 is consistent with the spectrum of a massive dirac hamiltonian with mass @xmath199 .",

    "all other bound modes are bidirectional modes .",
    "the numerical example of a dirac mass studied in the previous section that changed sign abruptly , as a step function , has the 1d schrodinger problem in an attractive delta function potential as its square .",
    "consequently , as we have seen , the model permitted for only a single bound state , corresponding to the unidirectional mode .    .",
    "the zero mode , on the other hand , is unbalanced , and furthermore , it corresponds to unidirectional propagation .",
    ", width=288 ]    for the generic case , the second order differential equation for the @xmath312 bound states can not be solved analytically .",
    "however , a formal solution for the zero mode eigenfrequency can be obtained , as it is obtained by solving a _ first order _ equation , as we now discuss .",
    "starting from the dirac equation for the more general case @xmath313 by definition , the `` zero mode '' has the free photon dispersion along the direction parallel to the wall , which implies that the function @xmath314 .",
    "we are thus left with the equation @xmath315 multiplying both sides with @xmath316 , we arrive at the following first order differential equation : @xmath317 which has as it s formal solution @xmath318 where @xmath319 .",
    "although there are formally two solutions for the zero mode , corresponding to @xmath320 , only one can occur ; the other is not normalizable and thus can not represent a physically observable state .",
    "now let the `` dirac mass '' term that opens the photonic band gap be a slowly varying function @xmath321 that changes monotonically ( and analytically ) from @xmath322 at @xmath204 = @xmath323 to @xmath324 at @xmath204 = @xmath325 .",
    "the photonic spectrum of modes with wavenumbers @xmath3 = @xmath326 near the `` dirac point '' @xmath292 , and which become doubly - degenerate at @xmath292 , is an adiabatic function of @xmath204 : @xmath327 where @xmath328 is the `` dirac speed '' . for @xmath329 ,",
    "the modes are evanescent as @xmath330 , so are localized on the wall . in the @xmath331 plane , the contours of constant @xmath332 are simple closed curves , enclosing a finite dimensionless area @xmath333 , given by @xmath334 where @xmath335 @xmath336 @xmath337 are the two `` turning point '' solutions of @xmath338 = @xmath339 . since @xmath321 is assumed to be monotonic , this can be written as @xmath340 note that this transformation has turned @xmath333 into a _ signed _ area , where @xmath341 = @xmath342 , which is indeed the correct form ( the function @xmath333 vanishes as @xmath343 , when its domain @xmath344 shrinks to zero ) . in the limit @xmath345 , @xmath346 , the formal location of the interface .",
    "then @xmath347 @xmath72 @xmath348 , and @xmath333 vanishes as @xmath349    it is very instructive to examine the special case @xmath350 which is integrable . in this case , @xmath351 thus the explicit dependence on @xmath352 can be eliminated , and @xmath353 this make the integral for @xmath333 trivial ( it becomes expressible in terms of a simple hilbert transform ) , and the asymptotic small-@xmath339 form ( [ limiting ] ) remains valid for _ all _ values of @xmath339 in the domain of the function : @xmath354 then the frequency of the interface mode with wavenumber @xmath355 = @xmath356 along the interface can be expressed as @xmath357 a standard `` semiclassical '' analysis of interference effects on a light ray trapped in a `` waveguide '' at an interface would conclude that the `` quantized '' values of @xmath358 corresponding to interface modes were @xmath359 where @xmath360 is a `` maslov phase '' , usually @xmath361 . in this case ,",
    "comparison with the exact solution of the integrable problem confirms that this problem instead has a vanishing `` maslov phase '' @xmath360 = 0 . this can be attributed to an underlying `` @xmath362 '' berry phase factor of @xmath363 ( berry phase of @xmath361 ) for orbiting around the degeneracy point at @xmath364 = @xmath365 .",
    "we then conclude that the interface modes at a slowly - varying interface are in general given ( for small @xmath356 ) by @xmath366 the unidirectional `` zero mode '' persists however sharp the interface is ; the bidirectional modes with @xmath367 must obey @xmath368 , which has fewer and fewer ( and eventually no ) solutions as the width of the interface region shrinks . in the special case of the integrable model ( [ tanh ] ) ,",
    "this spectrum is exact for small @xmath356 without any condition that the wall is slowly varying .",
    "the occurrence of zero energy modes in the 2d dirac hamiltonian is well known and represents the simplest example of a phenomenon known as the `` chiral anomaly '' .",
    "the crucial feature , namely , the occurrence of interfaces where the dirac mass gap changes sign , corresponds to tuning our photon band problem across a critical point using a faraday effect .",
    "we have shown that analogs of quantum hall effect edge modes can exist in photonic crystals whose band gaps can be tuned by a faraday coupling .",
    "the crucial new feature we present here here is that photonic systems can have bands with non - trivial topological properties including non - zero chern invariants .",
    "these in turn can be varied in a controlled manner to yield unidirectional ( `` chiral '' ) edge modes .",
    "the edge modes are robust against elastic back - scattering since they are states which are protected by the underlying 2d band structure topology .",
    "however , they are not robust against photon number non - conserving processes , such as absorption and other non - linear effects .",
    "we believe that this could be an entirely new direction in `` photonic band structure engineering '' due to the absence of scattering at bends and imperfections in the channel .",
    "a practical realization of such one - way transmission channels in photonics will necessarily have to deal with the problem of finding a magneto - optic material with a strong enough faraday effect to confine the light close to the interface .",
    "furthermore , in a practical design , the problem of te / tm mode mixing when light is confined in the direction perpendicular to the 2d system will have to be addressed .",
    "a practical design could , for instance , make use of pbg materials to confine light in the z - direction .",
    "although there are many obstacles to the realization of such interesting effects in photonics , none of them are fundamental , and we believe that these unidirectional channels could have potentially useful technological applications which could in principle be realized someday through `` bandstructure engineering '' .",
