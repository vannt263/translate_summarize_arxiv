    "a prompt , 9-th magnitude , optical flash has recently been detected ( @xcite ) accompanying the gamma ray burst ( grb ) grb990123 .",
    "the most natural explanation of this flash is emission from a reverse shock propagating into fireball ejecta shortly after it interacts with surrounding gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "although optical - uv emission from the reverse shock accompanying , or following shortly after , the @xmath0-ray emission has been predicted ( @xcite ) based on the simplest fireball models for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , the intensity of optical emission could not have been reliably predicted due to the uncertainty in reverse shock parameters .",
    "the observations of grb990123 suggest that the electron and magnetic field energy fractions in the reverse shock are similar to those in the forward shock propagating into the surrounding gas and producing the long term afterglow .",
    "this in turn implies that strong optical flashes accompanying @xmath0-ray emission is a generic grb characteristic .",
    "this is consistent with previous non - detection of optical flashes ( @xcite ) given the wide grb luminosity function ( @xcite ) and the fact that grb990123 is in the top 0.3% of the batse brightness distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is evidence in several grb afterglows for significant dust extinction , which may imply an association of grbs with star forming regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown that if grbs indeed reside in such environment , the ionizing x - ray and uv afterglow radiation may lead to time dependent ( on hour time scale ) absorption ( @xcite ) and emission ( @xcite ) line features . if h@xmath11 is present near the grb , conspicuous 11101650absorption will be imprinted on the spectrum , followed by uv fluorescence ( @xcite ) . on longer time scales , up to @xmath12  yr , grb photo - ionization may lead to indicative recombination line features , which may allow identification of grb remnants in nearby galaxies ( @xcite ) . here , we discuss dust sublimation by the optical - uv flash accompanying the grb . since grb990123 was an exceptionally bright burst , with exceptionally high intrinsic @xmath0-ray luminosity , we first discuss in  2 the optical - uv flash itself to obtain the scaling of optical - uv luminosity with burst energy , and to estimate the prompt optical - uv emission at energies above the @xmath13  ev energy of the prompt emission observed by akerlof et al .",
    "we show that if electron and magnetic field energy fractions in the reverse shock are similar among different bursts , then an optical - uv flash of luminosity @xmath14 , where @xmath2 is the beaming solid angle , is expected for a typical grb .",
    "dust destruction by thermal sublimation is discussed in  3 , and other possible destruction mechanism are considered in  4 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the analysis of the physics of dust destruction is independent of the model for optical - uv emission , and therefore of the discussion presented in  2 .",
    "however , we present numerical results for dust destruction based on the characteristic optical - uv luminosity derived in  2 . in  5 we discuss dust infra - red emission .",
    "the implications of our results are discussed in  6 .",
    "in fireball models of grbs ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , the energy released by an explosion is converted to kinetic energy of a thin baryonic shell expanding at an ultra - relativistic speed . after producing the grb , the shell impacts on surrounding gas , driving an ultra - relativistic shock into the ambient medium .",
    "after a short transition phase , the expanding blast wave approaches a self - similar behavior ( @xcite ) , where the expansion lorentz factor decreases with radius as @xmath15 .",
    "the initial interaction of fireball ejecta with surrounding gas produces a reverse shock which propagates into and decelerates the fireball ejecta .",
    "transition to self - similar behavior occurs on a time scale comparable to the reverse shock crossing time of the ejecta .",
    "the long term afterglow is produced by the forward , expanding shock that propagates into the surrounding gas",
    ". this shock continuously heats fresh gas and accelerates relativistic electrons , which produce the observed radiation through synchrotron emission .",
    "the most natural explanation of the optical flash is that it is due to synchrotron emission of electrons which are accelerated by the reverse shock , during the transition to self - similar behavior .",
    "once the reverse shock crosses the ejecta , the ejecta expand and cool adiabatically .",
    "thus , emission from the fireball ejecta is suppressed after the transition to self - similar expansion .",
    "since the optical flash is produced when the reverse shock crosses the ejecta , the plasma emitting the radiation expands with a lorentz factor which is close to that given by the blandford - mckee self - similar solution , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fireball energy and @xmath18 is the surrounding gas number density .",
    "the characteristic time over which radiation emitted by the fireball at radius @xmath19 is observed by a distant observer is @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the plasma lorentz factor during optical flash emission @xmath21 where @xmath22  erg , @xmath23  s is the observed duration , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "transition to self - similar expansion occurs on time scale @xmath26 comparable to the longer of the two time scales set by the initial conditions : the ( observed ) grb duration @xmath27 and the ( observed ) time @xmath28 at which the self - similar lorentz factor equals the original ejecta lorentz factor @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "that is , @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{delta_t}\\ ] ] during the transition , the unshocked fireball ejecta propagate at the original expansion lorentz factor , @xmath32 , and the lorentz factor of plasma shocked by the reverse shock in the rest frame of the unshocked ejecta is @xmath33 . if @xmath34 then @xmath35 , the reverse shock is relativistic , and the lorentz factor associated with the random motion of protons in the reverse shock is @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 then @xmath38 , and the reverse shock is not relativistic .",
    "nevertheless , the following argument suggests that the reverse shock speed is not far below @xmath39 , and that the protons are therefore heated to relativistic energy , @xmath40 .",
    "the comoving time , measured in the fireball ejecta frame prior to deceleration , is @xmath41 .",
    "the expansion lorentz factor is expected to vary across the ejecta , @xmath42 .",
    "such variation would lead to expansion of the ejecta , in the comoving frame , at relativistic speed .",
    "thus , at the deceleration radius , @xmath43 , the ejecta width exceeds @xmath44 .",
    "since the reverse shock should cross the ejecta over a deceleration time scale , @xmath45 , the reverse shock speed must be close to @xmath39 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the lorentz factor associated with the random motion of protons in the reverse shock is approximately given by @xmath46 for both @xmath38 and @xmath35 .",
    "for protons shocked by the forward shock @xmath47 , and therefore the ratio between thermal energy per proton in the reverse and forward shocks is @xmath48 .",
    "below we use this relation to derive the emission characteristics of the reverse shock by scaling the exact analytic results given for the forward shock emission in @xcite .",
    "if the fraction of thermal energy carried by electrons , @xmath49 , and magnetic field , @xmath50 , is similar in the forward and reverse shocks , then the frequency of peak synchrotron emission from the reverse shock is smaller than that of the forward shock by a factor @xmath51 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the energy density behind the reverse and forward shocks are similar , so that similar @xmath50 implies similar magnetic field strength in both regions , while similar @xmath49 implies @xmath52 . using eq .",
    "( 10 ) of @xcite for the forward shock peak frequency , we find that the reverse shock emission peaks at a frequency @xmath53 ( measured at the grb redshift ) . here",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are the values relevant for the reverse shock , which in general may differ from those of the forward shock .",
    "the numerical values we have used are those characteristic of the forward shock ( @xcite ) .    as demonstrated below , the cooling time of electrons in the reverse shock , radiating in the optical - uv range ,",
    "is long compared to the fireball expansion time . in this case , the peak synchrotron intensity is proportional to the product of magnetic field strength and number of radiating electrons ( and independent of the electron lorentz factor ) .",
    "the number of radiating electrons in the reverse shock is larger than in the forward shock by a factor @xmath54 .",
    "this can be deduced from the following considerations .",
    "the proton random lorentz factor in the reverse shock is @xmath54 times smaller than that in the forward shock .",
    "since the energy density in both regions is similar , the density of protons , and therefore of electrons , in the reverse shock is higher than that in the forward shock by the same factor . in addition , the width of the shocked fireball ejecta is similar to that of the shell of shocked surrounding gas , since both shocks propagate relativistically in the shocked plasma frame .",
    "thus , if @xmath50 is similar in the reverse and forward shock , the peak synchrotron intensity @xmath55 is higher in the reverse shock by a factor @xmath54 . using eq .",
    "( 11 ) of @xcite we find for the reverse shock @xmath56 for a flat universe with zero cosmological constant , and @xmath57 .",
    "the decay of grb990123 optical flux implies an electron energy distribution @xmath58 with @xmath59 ( @xcite ) , for which the intensity at @xmath60 is @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the optical [ @xmath62  hz ] intensity is @xmath63 for the parameters of grb990123 ,",
    "@xmath64  s and @xmath65  erg ( based on the @xmath0-ray fluence @xmath66 ) , we obtain @xmath67  jy , approximately twice the peak observed flux .",
    "thus , the observed optical flash can be naturally explained by the simplest fireball model , provided the reverse shock parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 are similar to those implied for the forward shock by afterglow observations , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "if this is typical , than for a typical grb , with @xmath70  erg and @xmath71  s , we find @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the frequency at the redshift of the grb .",
    "the form ( [ l_nu ] ) is valid for frequencies @xmath73 larger than the peak frequency @xmath74 , and smaller than the frequency @xmath75 above which emission is dominated by electrons for which the cooling time is shorter than the dynamic time .",
    "since the energy density in the reverse and forward shock regions is similar , @xmath75 ( at the grb redshift ) is given by @xmath76 at frequencies @xmath77 the spectrum steepens to @xmath78 .",
    "strong optical - uv emission requires , similar to grb @xmath0-ray production , large initial lorentz factor , @xmath79 : eq .",
    "( [ delta_t ] ) implies that @xmath80 for @xmath81 , and the optical - uv luminosity given by eq .",
    "( [ l_nu ] ) drops as @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that the plasma emitting the optical - uv photons must also be expanding at high lorentz factor , @xmath83 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ delta_t],[gamma ] ) ] , and strong optical - uv emission may be confined , similar to @xmath0-rays , to a cone around the line of sight of opening angle @xmath84 .",
    "this may be the case if , e.g. , the fireball is a jet of opening angle @xmath85 .",
    "a jet of finite opening angle expands as if it were a conical section of a spherical fireball , as long as @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the analysis presented above is valid for a jet - like fireball . in this case",
    ", the energy @xmath17 in the above equations should be understood as the energy that the fireball would have carried if it were spherically symmetric , and the optical - uv , as well as @xmath0-ray , emission is confined to a small solid angle @xmath87 with optical - uv luminosity given by @xmath88 .    it should be noted that prompt optical emission has been observed for only 1 grb to date , and therefore may not be typical of grbs .",
    "indeed , fireballs in low density environments with @xmath89 would not be expected to produce strong prompt emission [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_v ] ) ] . however , we note from eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_v ] ) that optical flashes are expected for typical grbs with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and should not be limited to unusually luminous grbs such as grb990123 .",
    "as discussed in  3.3 below , in dense regions radiation with @xmath92  ev will largely go into photoionizing h and h@xmath11 , and photons in the 7.513.6  ev range will primarily be absorbed by h@xmath11 , which is rovibrationally excited by ultraviolet pumping ( draine 1999b ) .",
    "we therefore first discuss , in  3.1 and  3.2 , sublimation of dust grains under the assumption that dust heating is dominated by @xmath93  ev photons , and discuss the contribution of 7.550  ev photons to dust sublimation in  3.3 .",
    "using equations ( [ l_nu ] ) and ( [ nu_c ] ) , we find that for typical grb parameters , the prompt luminosity in the 17.5  ev range is @xmath94 and the 7.550  ev prompt luminosity is @xmath95 .",
    "since our simple analysis overestimates the flux of grb990123 by a factor @xmath96 , we will take the typical 17.5  ev luminosity to be @xmath97 , and the 7.550  ev luminosity to be @xmath98 .",
    "consider a grain of radius @xmath99 located at a distance @xmath19 from a transient source of radiation radiating a 17.5 ev power @xmath100 into a solid angle @xmath2 .",
    "if the radiation from the grb is `` beamed '' into @xmath101 , we will consider only dust grains within the beam .",
    "note that we expect the beaming of optical - uv emission from the forward shock to be similar to that of gamma - ray emission .",

    "we have shown in  2 that strong optical - uv emission requires , like grb @xmath0-ray production , large initial expansion lorentz factor , @xmath79 , which also implies that the plasma emitting the optical - uv flash must be expanding with @xmath83 .",
    "thus , if the fireball is a jet of finite opening angle , @xmath250 , then both @xmath0-ray and optical - uv emission will be confined to a small solid angle @xmath87 . in this case , dust would be evaporated only within a narrow cone around the line of sight .",
    "a jet - like fireball expands as a conical section of a spherical fireball , with @xmath251 , as long as @xmath252 .",
    "after deceleration to @xmath253 , the jet expands sideways , its opening angle increasing to @xmath254 and @xmath255 ( @xcite ) . at this stage radiation reaching us must travel a distance @xmath256 through gas which was not exposed to the initial flash , and which will still contain dust . for @xmath257 , and using @xmath258 , we have @xmath259 .",
    "thus , a significant increase in extinction over time would be observed if @xmath260 .",
    "confinement of @xmath0-ray and strong optical - uv emission to a small solid angle is not limited to the case of a jet - like fireball .",
    "it may also arise if @xmath29 , the initial expansion lorentz factor , is anisotropic .",
    "consider a fireball carrying similar energy per unit solid angle in all directions , with @xmath29 a decreasing function of angle with respect to the line of sight , such that @xmath261 for @xmath262 . in this case ,",
    "optical - uv ( and @xmath0-ray ) emission would be suppressed at angles @xmath262 .",
    "the isotropic fireball energy per unit solid angle implies that , after a transition phase , the fireball would approach spherical expansion , with @xmath251 . at this stage ,",
    "most of the radiation detected at time @xmath263 by a distant observer is produced by fireball plasma within a narrow ring of radius @xmath264 around the line of sight , where the fireball radius @xmath19 and expansion lorentz factor @xmath265 are related to @xmath263 through @xmath266 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , here too a significant increase in reddening is expected once @xmath267 drops below @xmath268 . for",
    "@xmath269 most of the radiation reaching us must pass through a path length @xmath270 of gas which was not exposed to the initial flash .",
    "finally , it should be noted that although optical flashes are expected for typical grbs [ with @xmath90 and @xmath271 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_v ] ) ] , prompt optical emission has been observed for only 1 grb to date and therefore may not accompany all grbs .",
    "indeed , fireballs in low density environments with @xmath89 would not be expected to produce strong prompt emission [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_v ] ) ] .",
    "in addition , if the fireball initial lorentz factor @xmath272 , reverse shock emission may be shifted to photon energies above 7.5  ev [ see eq .",
    "( [ nu_m ] ) ] , where most photons are absorbed by h and h@xmath11 .",
