    "epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression or complex phenotype that are not associated with changes in dna sequence and but inherited through cell division .",
    "epigenetic markers often change within an individual over time and are cell type specific  @xcite .",
    "epigenetics has been shown to play a critical role in cell differentiation , development , and tumorigenesis  @xcite .",
    "dna methylation is probably the best studied epigenetic modification of dna , but our understanding of dna methylation is still in its infancy . in vertebrates ,",
    "dna methylation occurs by adding a methyl group to the fifth carbon of the cytosine residue , mainly in the context of neighboring cytosine and guanine nucleotides in the genome ( 5-cg-3 dinucleotides or _",
    "cpg sites _ ) mediated by dna methyl - transferases ( dnmts )  @xcite .",
    "dna methylation has been shown to play an important functional role in the cell , including involvement in dna replication and gene transcription , with substantial downstream association with development , aging , and cancer  @xcite .",
    "cpg sites are underrepresented in the human genome relative to their expected frequency as a result of being a _ mutation hotspot _",
    ", where the deamination of methylated cytosines often changes cpg sites into tpg sites  @xcite .",
    "although cpg sites are mainly methylated across the mammalian genome  @xcite , there are distinct , mostly unmethylated cg - rich regions termed cpg islands ( cgis ) that have a g+c content greater than @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "cgis account for @xmath3 of the genome and are often located in promoters and exonic regions in mammalian genomes  @xcite .",
    "methylation patterns in cgis that are in promoter regions , where most previous studies have focused attention , have recently been shown to differ from methylation patterns elsewhere , indicating a specific biological role for these promoter cgis  @xcite .",
    "cgis have been shown to co - localize with dna regulatory elements such as transcription factor binding sites ( tfbss )  @xcite and dna binding insulator proteins , such as ctcf , which protect downstream dna from upstream methylation activities  @xcite . across the genome , dna methylation levels",
    "have been shown to be associated with gene regions , active chromatin marks  @xcite , cis - acting dna regulatory elements , and proximal sequence elements  @xcite , giving hints about the processes that regulate methylation and how methylation may in turn impact cellular phenotypes .    the non - uniform distribution of cpg sites across the human genome and the important role of methylation in cellular processes imply that characterizing genome - wide dna methylation patterns is necessary to better understand the regulatory mechanisms of this epigenetic phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "recent advances in methylation - specific microarray and sequencing technologies have enabled the assay of dna methylation patterns genome - wide and at single base - pair resolution  @xcite .",
    "the current gold standard to quantify single site dna methylation levels across an individual s genome is whole genome bisulfite sequencing ( wgbs ) , which quantifies dna methylation levels at @xmath4 million ( out of @xmath5 million total ) cpg sites in the human genome  @xcite .",
    "however , wgbs is prohibitively expensive for most current studies , is subject to conversion bias , and is difficult to perform in particular genomic regions  @xcite .",
    "other sequencing methods include methylated dna immunoprecipitation ( medip ) sequencing , which is experimentally difficult and expensive , and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing ( rrbs ) , which assays cpg sites in small regions of the genome  @xcite . as an alternative , methylation microarrays , and the illumina humanmethylation 450k beadchip in particular , measure bisulphite treated dna methylation levels at @xmath6 preselected cpg sites genome - wide  @xcite ; however , these arrays assay less than @xmath7 of cpg sites , and this percentage is biased to gene regions and cgis .",
    "quantitative methods are needed to predict methylation status at unassayed sites and genomic regions .    in this study , we examined measurements of methylation levels in @xmath8 individuals using the illumina 450k beadchip  @xcite . within these methylation profiles , we examined the patterns and correlation structure of the cpg sites , with attention to characterizing methylation patterns in cgi regions . using features that included neighboring cpg site methylation status , genomic location , local genomic features , and co - localized regulatory elements",
    ", we developed a random forest classifier to predict single cpg site methylation levels . using this model",
    ", we were able to identify dna regulatory elements that may interact with dna methylation at specific cpg sites , providing hypotheses for experimental studies on mechanisms by which methylation is regulated or leads to biological changes or disease phenotypes .",
    "methylation status is a delicate epigenomic feature to characterize , and even more challenging to predict , because assayed dna methylation marks are ( a ) an average across the sampled cells , ( b ) cell type specific , ( c ) environmentally unstable , and ( d ) not well - correlated within a genomic locus  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether either predicted or measured methylation status at specific cpg sites generalize well across platforms , cell types , individuals , or genomic regions  @xcite .",
    "a number of methods to predict methylation status have been developed ( table  s1 ) .",
    "most of these methods assume that methylation status is encoded as a binary variable , e.g. , a cpg site is either methylated or unmethylated in an individual  @xcite .",
    "these methods have often limited predictions to specific regions of the genome , such as cgis  @xcite .",
    "more broadly , all of these methods make predictions of average methylation status for windows of the genome instead of individual cpg sites .",
    "our model is an attempt to develop a general method for predicting methylation levels at individual cpg sites by removing the simplifying assumptions of current methods without sacrificing prediction accuracy .",
    "the relative success of these methods depends heavily on the prediction objectives .",
    "all of the studies that achieved prediction accuracy @xmath9  @xcite predicted average methylation status within cgis or dna fragments within cgis .",
    "most of the cpg sites in cgis are unmethylated across the genome  @xcite  for example , @xmath10 of cpg sites in cgis in cells from human brain were found to be methylated using a wgbs approach  @xcite  so it is not surprising that classifiers limited to these regions perform well .",
    "studies not limiting prediction to cgis uniformly achieved lower accuracies , ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "many of these methods predicted binary methylation status ; one study used categorical methylation status  @xcite .",
    "another study predicted average methylation levels as a continuous variable  @xcite , and the predictions achieved a maximum correlation coefficient of @xmath13 and a root mean square error ( rmse ) of @xmath14 ; however , the study was limited to @xmath15 dna fragments instead of a genome - wide analysis .    across these methods ,",
    "features that are used for dna methylation prediction include : dna composition ( proximal dna sequence patterns ) , predicted dna structure ( e.g. , co - localized introns ) , repeat elements , tfbss , evolutionary conservation ( e.g. , _ phastcons _",
    "@xcite ) , number of snps , gc content , alu elements , histone modification marks , and functional annotations of nearby genes .",
    "several studies only using dna composition features achieved prediction accuracies ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "et al . _ used @xmath17 features including dna composition , dna structure , repeat elements , tfbss , evolutionary conservation , and number of snps ; zheng _ et al .",
    "_ included @xmath18 features including dna composition , dna structure , tfbss , histone modification marks , and functional annotations of nearby genes .",
    "two studies did not use any dna composition features  @xcite .",
    "the relative contribution of each feature to prediction quality is not quantified well across these studies because of the different methods and prediction objectives .",
    "the majority of these methods are based on support vector machine ( svm ) classifiers  @xcite .",
    "general non - additive interactions between features are not encoded when using linear kernels , as most of these svm - based classifiers used .",
    "if a more sophisticated kernel is used , such as a radial basis function kernel ( rbf ) , within the svm - based approach , the contribution of each feature to the prediction quality is not readily available .",
    "three studies included alternative classification frameworks : one found that a decision tree classifier achieved better performance than an svm - based classifier  @xcite .",
    "another study found that a naive bayes classifier achieved the best prediction performance  @xcite .",
    "a third study used a word composition - based encoding method  @xcite . in our study , we choose to use a random forest classifier because it encodes non - additive interactions between features and because the relative contribution of each feature to prediction quality is quantifiable .",
    "our method for predicting dna methylation levels at cpg sites genome - wide differs from these current state - of - the - art classifiers in that it : ( a ) uses a genome - wide approach , ( b ) makes predictions at single cpg site resolution , ( c ) is based on a random forest classifier , ( d ) predicts methylation levels instead of methylation status , ( e ) incorporates a diverse set of predictive features , including regulatory marks from the encode project , and ( f ) allows the quantification of the contribution of each feature to prediction .",
    "we find that these differences substantially improve the performance of the classifier and also provide testable biological insights into how methylation regulates , or is regulated by , specific genomic and epigenomic processes .",
    "dna methylation profiles were measured in whole blood samples from @xmath8 unrelated individuals by illumina humanmethylation 450k beadchips at single cpg site resolution for @xmath19 cpg sites  @xcite .",
    "single cpg site methylation levels are quantified by @xmath20 , the ratio of the methylated probe intensity and the sum of the methylated and unmethylated probe intensities , which ranges from 0 ( unmethylated ) to 1 ( methylated ) . within the single - site @xmath20 values across individuals , we controlled for probe chip position , sample age , and sample sex . after these data were preprocessed ( see materials and methods ) , @xmath21 cpg sites remained across the @xmath22 autosomal chromosomes .",
    "first we examined the distribution of dna methylation levels , @xmath20 , at cpg sites on autosomal chromosomes across all @xmath8 individuals ( figure  1a ) .",
    "the majority of cpg sites were either hypermethylated or hypomethylated , with @xmath23 of sites with @xmath24 and @xmath25 of sites with @xmath26 .",
    "using a cutoff of @xmath27 , across the methylation profiles and individuals , @xmath28 of these cpg sites have a _ methylated status _ ( @xmath29 ) . across the individuals , we observed distinct patterns of dna methylation levels in different genomic regions ( figure  1b ) . using cgis labeled in the ucsc genome browser  @xcite",
    ", we defined _ cgi shores _ as regions @xmath30 kb away from cgis in both directions and _ cgi shelves _ as regions @xmath31 kb away from cgis in both directions  @xcite .",
    "we found that cpg sites in cgis were hypomethylated ( @xmath32 of sites with @xmath26 ) and sites in non - cgis were hypermethylated ( @xmath33 of sites with @xmath24 ) , while cpg sites in cgi shore regions had variable methylation levels following a u - shape distribution ( @xmath34 of sites with @xmath24 and @xmath35 of sites with @xmath26 ) , and cpg sites in cgi shelf regions were hypermethylated ( @xmath36 of sites with @xmath24 ) .",
    "these distinct patterns reflect highly context - specific dna methylation levels genome - wide .",

    "panel b : distribution of dna methylation values for cpg sites within cgis , cgi shores , cgi shelves , and non - cgi regions.,width=384 ]    dna methylation levels at nearby cpg sites have previously been found to be correlated ( indicating possible co - methylation ) , particularly when cpg sites are within @xmath37 kb from each other  @xcite ; these patterns are in contrast with the correlation among nearby genotypes due to linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) that often extends to large genomic regions from a few kilobases to @xmath38 mb  @xcite .",
    "we quantified the correlation of methylation levels ( @xmath20 ) between neighboring pairs of cpg sites using the absolute value pearson s correlation across individuals .",
    "we found that correlation of methylation levels between neighboring ( or adjacent on the array ) cpg sites decreased rapidly to approximately @xmath39 within @xmath15 bp , in contrast to sharp decays noted within @xmath40 kb in previous studies with sparser cpg coverage ( figure  2a )  @xcite .",
    "we found the rate of decay in correlation to be highly dependent on genomic context ; for example , for neighboring cpg sites in the same cgi shore and shelf region , correlation decreases continuously until it is well below what is expected ( figure  2a ) .",
    "because of the over - representation of cpg sites near cgis on the array , an increase in correlation can be observed as neighboring sites extend past the cgi shelf regions , where there is lower correlation with cgi methylation levels than we observe in the background .",

    "the lines represent cubic smoothing splines fitted to the correlation data .",
    "panel b : the mse was calculated for cpg sites ( y - axis ) for each pair of cpg sites within the genomic distance window.,width=384 ]    to make this decay more precise , we contrasted the observed decay to the level of _ background correlation _ ( @xmath42 ) , which is the average absolute value correlation between the methylation levels of pairs of randomly selected cpg sites across chromosomes ( figure  2a , figure 3 ) .",
    "we found substantial differences in correlation between neighboring cpg sites versus arbitrary pairs of cpg sites at identical distances , presumably because of the dense cpg tiling on the 450k array within cgi regions .",
    "interestingly , the slope of the correlation decay plateaus after the cpg sites are approximately @xmath43 bp apart ( both for neighbors and for arbitrary pairs of a specified distance ) , but the distribution of correlation between pairs of cpg sites is not substantially different from the distribution of background correlation even within @xmath44 kb ( figure  s1a ) . while this certainly suggests that there are may be patterns of methylation that extend to large genomic regions , the pattern of extreme decay within approximately @xmath43 bp across the genome indicates that , in general , methylation may be biologically manipulated within very small genomic regions .",
    "thus , neighboring cpg sites may only be useful for prediction when the sites are sampled at sufficiently high densities across the genome .",
    "kb ( panel a ) , @xmath45 mb ( panel c ) and @xmath46 mb ( panel e ) ; the right column plots show the mse patterns of cpg sites in relation to their genomic distances with distance range @xmath8 kb ( panel b ) , @xmath45 mb ( panel d ) and @xmath46 mb ( panel f ) .",
    "the solid horizontal lines represent the background correlation or mse level calculated from @xmath47 pairs of cpg sites from a different chromosome.,width=384 ]    we repeated these experiments using mean squared error ( mse ) between cpg site levels to quantify patterns of decay of methylation within each individual , instead of across individuals as is measured with the correlation analyses ( see materials and methods ; figure  2b , figure 3 ) .",
    "in general , the mse trends echo the local patterns seen in the correlation analysis and also appear to be region specific . in cgi regions ,",
    "the mse of neighboring sites was low and increased slowly with genomic distance .",
    "in contrast , mse in cgi shore and shelf regions increased rapidly to an mse higher than background mse ( @xmath48 ) , indicating that the edges of a single shore and shelf region are less predictive of each other than any two cpg sites at random .",
    "the individual - specific mse between neighboring sites ( figure  s1b ) shows a much higher deviation from background distribution of mse at @xmath44 kb relative to correlation , indicating that the biological manipulation of methylation in larger genomic regions may be individual specific , such as being driven by genetic variants or environmental effects .    as we observed that methylation patterns at neighboring cpg sites depended heavily on genomic content , we further investigated methylation patterns within cgis , cgi shores , and cgi shelves .",
    "methylation levels at cgis and cgi shelves were fairly constant genome - wide and across individuals ",
    "cgis are hypomethylated and cgi shelves are hypermethylated  but cgi shores exhibit a reproducible but drastic pattern of change ( figure  4a ) .",
    "cpg sites in cgi shores have a monotone increasing pattern of methylation status from cgis towards cgi shelves , and this pattern is symmetric in the cgi shores upstream and downstream of cgis .",
    "if we examine the mse between pairs of cpg sites methylation status in these regions , we find that mse within the cgi and within the cgi shelves is low , consistent with the variance we observed within dna methylation profiles in these regions ( figure  4b ) .",
    "additionally , we find that the mse between the cpg sites in the shelves appears to increase as the sites are further away from the cgi on the shelf , suggesting a circular dependency in methylation status between the ends of the shelf sequences .",
    "it is interesting that the cpg sites in the shore regions appear substantially more predictive of cpg sites in the shelf regions than those in the cgi regions , although this may indicate a less precise delineation of the shore and shelf regions relative to the cgi and cgi shore delineation .",

    "x - axis and y - axis represent the genomic position of each cgi with a scale of 1:100 , i.e. one unit in matrix represents @xmath8 bp distance .",
    "the mse of each unit cell was calculated for all pairwise cpg sites with one site located in the relative scaled position on x - axis and the other one on y - axis , and then averaged over 100 individuals.,width=576 ]    to quantify the amount of variation in dna methylation explained by genomic context , we considered the correlation between genomic context and principle components ( pcs ) of methylation levels across all @xmath8 individuals ( figure 5 ) .",
    "we found that many of the features derived from the cpg site s genomic context appear to be correlated with the first principal component ( pc1 ) .",
    "methylation statuses of upstream and downstream neighboring cpg sites and a co - localized dnase i hypersensitive ( dhs ) site are the most highly correlated features , both with pearson s correlation around @xmath49 ( figures  5 ) .",
    "ten genomic features all have correlation @xmath50 with pc1 , including co - localized active tfbss elf1 ( ets - related transcription factor 1 ) , maz ( myc - associated zinc finger protein ) , mxi1 ( max - interacting protein 1 ) and runx3 ( runt - related transcription factor 3 ) , suggesting that they may be useful in predicting dna methylation status ( figure  s2 ) .",
    "that said , the features themselves are well correlated ; for example , active tfbs are highly enriched within dhs sites ( correlation @xmath51 )  @xcite .     cpg sites .",
    "the correlation with each of the features was calculated between the first ten methylation pcs ( y - axis ) and all features ( x - axis).,width=672 ]      these observations about patterns of dna methylation suggest that correlation in dna methylation is local and dependent on genomic context .",
    "thus , prediction of dna methylation status based only on methylation levels at neighboring cpg sites may not perform well , especially in sparsely assayed regions of the genome . using prediction features including neighboring cpg site methylation levels and a number of features characterizing genomic context",
    ", we built a classifier to predict dna methylation status , where status indicates no methylation ( 0 ) or complete methylation ( 1 ) at a cpg site .",
    "there were @xmath52 sites with neighboring cpg sites at arbitrary distances used in these analysis per individual .",
    "the @xmath53 features that we used for dna methylation status prediction fall into four different classes ( table s4 ) :    * _ neighbors _ : one upstream and one downstream neighboring ( cpg sites assayed on the array and adjacent in the genome ) cpg sites genomic distances , binary methylation status , and @xmath20 values , * _ genomic position _ :",

    "we quantified generalization error for each feature set using a modified version of repeated random subsampling , where the training and test sets are within the same individual ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "we used prediction accuracy , specificity , sensitivity , and area under the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve ( auc ) to evaluate our predictions ( see materials and methods ) .    using all @xmath53 features and",

    "however , we also found that the additional features improve prediction substantially over just using the _ neighbors _ features , which has an accuracy of @xmath64 and an auc of @xmath65 ( t - test @xmath66 ) .    because the correlation between neighboring cpg sites methylation levels decays rapidly with distance",
    ", we considered restricting the window size for neighboring cpg sites to @xmath45 kb , @xmath67 kb , and arbitrary distances on the same chromosome : predictions at cpg sites where one or both of the neighboring cpg sites were greater than this distance were excluded .",

    "interestingly , while prediction accuracy , auc , and specificity all improved when restricting neighboring sites to shorter genomic windows , sensitivity , or @xmath76 , was increasingly worse , indicating that the statistical gain in restricting site distance is in eliminating type i errors ( false positives ) rather than in predicting a higher proportion of methylated sites correctly ( true positives ; table 1 ) .    to determine how predictive methylation profiles were across individuals",

    "panel b : gini scores for the top 10 tfbs.,width=384 ]    several tfs were among the most highly ranked features across experiments ( figure  7b ) , some of which are known to be associated with dna methylation , including elf1 , runx3 , maz , mxi1 , and max .",
    "indeed , the ets - related transcription factor ( elf1 ) has been shown to be overrepresented in methylated regions , associating dna methylation with hemapotopoiesis in hematopoietic stem cells  @xcite .",
    "runx3 ( runt - related transcription factor 3 ) , a strong tumor suppressor associated with diverse tumor types , has been suggested to be associated with cancer development through regulating global dna methylation levels  @xcite .",
    "runx3 expression is associated with aberrant dna methylation in adenocarcinoma cells  @xcite , primary bladder tumor cells  @xcite , and breast cancer cells  @xcite . for another tumor suppressor transcription factor00 , mxi1 ( max - interacting protein 1 ) , expression levels ( specifically , lack of expression )",
    "have been reported to be associated with promoter methylation levels and neuroblastic tumorigenesis  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that suppression of maz ( myc - associated zinc finger protein ) may be associated with dna methyltransferase i , the key factor for _ de novo _ dna methylation  @xcite .",
    "mxi1 and max ( myc - associated factor x ) both interact with c - myc ( myelocytomatosis oncogene ) , a well characterized oncogene , which has been shown to be methylation sensitive , meaning that the tf motifs contain cpg sites and , thus , tf binding is sensitive to methylation status at those sites  @xcite .",
    "this suggests a potential regulatory relationship between max , mxi1 , and dna methylation that may extend to downstream cancer tumor development .",
    "we found that the feature rankings based on gini scores differed only slightly across experiments ( figure 7a and 7b ) , indicating the robustness of the gini index to quantify contribution to prediction accuracy .",
    "we found that the correlation between a binary feature and pc1 is proportional to the gini index of that feature ( figure 5 and table s2 ) .",
    "the variation in the gini index rankings for tfbss varied more than we expected based on the other features ( figure s6 ) .",
    "tfbss that co - occur with cpg sites more often tend to be more important for prediction , according to the gini index score .",
    "we found that the gini index of a binary feature has a log linear relationship with the number of co - occurrences of that binary feature with cpg sites in the data set : the more often a cpg site in the training set co - occurred with a tfbs , the higher the gini index rank of that cpg site .",
    "there were several outliers to this trend , including upstream and downstream cpg site methylation status , status of promoter , gene body , and non cgi regions , and three tfbss ( pol3 ( rna polymerase iii ) , rxr-@xmath100 ( retinoid x receptor alpha ) and c - fos ( a proto - oncogene ) ) .",
    "these features were less important than we would predict using the fitted linear regression model of log gini importance .",
    "this trend limits the strong conclusions that associate specific tfbss with dna methylation biochemically from a high gini index rank for that tfbs ; it may be that there are general relationships between tfbs and cpg sites that we are learning , but a relatively high tfbs frequency in these data will artificially inflate the rank of that tfbs in comparison to the others ( figure  s6 ) .",
    "most cpg sites within tfbss have low average methylation levels ( table s3 ) .",
    "several tfbss have disproportionately high average methylation values : for example znf274 ( zinc - finger protein 274 ) and jund ( jun d proto - oncogene ) ; however , both of these outliers also have a low co - occurrence frequency with cpg sites in these data , suggesting that this finding may be an artifact .",
    "we characterized genome - wide and region - specific patterns of dna methylation .",
    "these region - specific patterns raise additional questions , including how these observations may resolve or at least suggest causal relationships between methylation and other genomic and epigenomic processes . with single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp )",
    "associations with complex traits , it is likely that the genotype drives associated processes rather than the other way around ; the causal relationship is established by inductive logic , since it is biologically difficult to perform site - specific mutation .",
    "the dynamic nature of cpg site methylation means that no such causal relationship can be established inductively ; however , experiments can be designed to establish the impact of changing the methylation status of a cpg site  @xcite .",
    "conditional analyses , such as those developed for dna , may prove to be illuminating for epigenomics  @xcite , but the current data are still murky .",
    "for example , does a tfbs containing a cpg site prevent methylation when a transcription factor is actively bound , or does a methylated cpg site in a tfbs prevent a tf from binding to that site ?",
    "we built a random forest predictor of dna methylation levels at cpg site resolution . in our comparison between random forest classifiers and svm classifiers",
    ", we found that improvements of the random forest classifier include i ) better prediction for more sparsely sampled genomic regions , and ii ) biological interpretability that comes from the ability to readily extract information about the importance of each feature in prediction .",
    "the accuracy results for predictions based on this model are promising , and suggest the possibility of imputing cpg site methylation levels genome - wide in the future .",
    "for example , if we assay a set of individuals in an ewas study on the illumina 450k array , we may be able to impute the missing genome - wide cpg sites from wgbs assays .",
    "however , we are still far from the prediction accuracies currently expected for snp imputation for downstream use in gwas studies .",
    "our cross - sample analysis illustrates that including methylation profiles from other individuals as references , as is done for dna imputation  @xcite , may improve accuracies substantially .",
    "however , because of biological , batch , and environmental effects on dna methylation , it is possible that precise imputation will require a much larger reference panel relative to dna imputation . as in gwas studies ,",
    "all of these imputation methods will fail to predict rare or unexpected variants  @xcite , which may hold a substantial proportion of association signal for both gwas and ewas  @xcite .",
    "this work raises the additional question , then , of how best to sample cpg sites across the genome given the methylation patterns and the possibility of imputation ; for example , it may be sufficient to assay a single cpg site within a cgi and impute the others , given the high correlation between methylation values in cpg sites within the same cgi .",
    "we identified genomic and epigenomic features that were most predictive of methylation status for co - located cpg sites .",
    "the biological functions of cgi shore and shelf regions , and in particular the impact of methylation in these regions , are mostly unknown ; however , it has been shown there is substantial dna methylation variation in cgi shore regions relative to other regions in the genome , and these alterations may contribute to cancer development and tissue differentiation  @xcite .",
    "we hope to better characterize the role of cgi shore and shelf regions with respect to enrichment of particular regulatory elements in the future to understand the cellular role of these regions and the specific , curious pattern of methylation found within them .",
    "one particularly important driver of methylation that we do not study carefully here is methylation quantitative trait loci ( meqtls ) , or genetic drivers of methylation  @xcite .",
    "there is substantial work on the enrichment of meqtls within snps and genetic loci that appear to regulate gene transcription levels ( eqtls ) , dhs site status ( dsqtls ) , and others  @xcite .",
    "the characterizations described here lead us to consider identifying qtls associated with deviations from cre - specific methylation patterns instead of single cpg sites , as has been done with methylation in cgi shore regions and associations with cancer  @xcite .",
    "we investigated genome - wide methylation in 100 individuals profiled using the illumina 450k array .",
    "we identified patterns of correlation in dna methylation at cpg sites specific to cpg islands , cgi shores , and non - cgis , quantifying the variability within cgi shore regions and a pattern of correlation across the shelf regions by which correlation increases with distance .",
    "we built a random forest classifier to predict methylation as a binary status and as a continuous level at single cpg site accuracy , using as features neighboring cpg site information , genomic position , dna sequence properties , and cis - regulatory element co - location information .",
    "our method outperformed state - of - the art methylation classifiers , including our own version of an svm - based classifier .",
    "our approach quantifies features that are most predictive of cpg status : we found that neighboring cpg site methylation levels , location in a cpg island , and co - localized dhs sites and specific transcription factor binding sites were most predictive of dna methylation levels .",
    "we identify several tfbss , including elf1 , maz , mxi1 , and runx3 , that are highly predictive of methylation levels in whole blood .",
    "these predictive features may play a mechanistic role in methylation , either in regulating the methylation of cpg sites or as a downstream partner in modifying the cellular phenotype .",
    "illumina humanmethylation450k array data were obtained for 100 unrelated individuals from the twinsuk cohort  @xcite all participants in the study provided written informed consent in accordance with local ethics research committees .",

    "methylation values for each cpg site are quantified by the term @xmath20 , which is the fraction of methylated bead signal over the sum of methylated and unmethylated bead signal :    @xmath105    where _ methy _ represents the signal intensity of the methylated probe and _ unmethy _ represents the signal intensity of the unmethylated probe .",

    "we performed pca on methylation values of cpg sites by computing the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of a subsample of cpg sites using the r function svd . among the @xmath52 cpg sites that have complete feature information , @xmath118 sites ( every tenth cpg site )",
