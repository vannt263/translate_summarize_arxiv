    "game theory a branch of applied mathematics , was initially developed for use in economics by von neumann and morgenstern [ 1 ] and important contributions were given by john nash [ 2 ] .",
    "it attempts to capture mathematical behavior in strategic situations , in which an individual s success of making a choice depends on the choice of the other players .",
    "it is usually used to model the behavior of biological , economical and computer systems . during last few years",
    ", a number of classical games has been converted into the realm of quantum mechanics [ 3 - 18 ] .",
    "recently , miszczak et al . [ 19 ] has studied a qubit flip game on a heisenberg spin chain .",
    "they have shown that being well aware of the dimensionality of the system , a player can achieve a mean payoff equal to almost 1 . more recently , sharif et al . [",
    "20 ] has proposed the quantum solution to a three - player kolkata restaurant problem .",
    "the kolkata paise restaurant ( kpr ) [ 21 ] is a repeated game similar to the minority games , played between a large number of agents having no interaction among themselves . since quantum minority games [ 22 - 25 ]",
    "has attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "they have also been analyzed under the influence of decoherence by flitney and hollenberg [ 26 ] .",
    "it is therefore , important to study the behaviour of quantum restaurant problem in the presence of environmental influences .    since , it is  not possible to completely isolate a quantum system from its environment .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the system - environment dynamics in the presence of environmental effects .",
    "quantum games may provide a feasible platform for implementing quantum information processing in physical systems [ 27 ] and can be used to probe the influence of decoherence in such systems [ 6 , 28 - 31 ] . in this connection ,",
    "quantum channels provide a natural theoretical framework for the study of decoherence in noisy quantum communication systems .",
    "quantum error correction [ 32 - 33 ] and entanglement purifications [ 34 ] can be employed to avoid the problem of decoherence .    in this paper ,",
    "the effect of quantum decoherence in a three - player quantum kolkata restaurant problem is studied using entangled qutrit states . by considering different noisy qutrit channels parameterized by decoherence parameter @xmath1 such that",
    "@xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the lower and upper limits of decoherence parameter represent the fully coherent and fully decohered system , respectively .",
    "it is seen that for lower level of decoherence , amplitude damping channel heavily influences the payoffs as compared to the depolarizing and flipping channels .",
    "however , for higher level of decoherence , the payoff is strongly affected by depolarizing noise . on the other hand ,",
    "the behaviour of phase damping channel is symmetrical around 50 % decoherence .",
    "furthermore , the nash equilibrium of the problem does not change under decoherence .",
    "in the kolkata paise restaurant ( kpr ) problem , @xmath3 non - communicating agents have to choose between @xmath4 choices .",
    "the agents receive a gain in their utility if their choice is not too crowded , i.e. the number of agents that made the same choice is under some threshold limit .",
    "the choices can also have different values of utility associated with them , accounting for a preference profile over the set of choices .",
    "therefore , in kpr , @xmath3 prospective customers choose from @xmath3 restaurants each evening in a parallel decision mode .",
    "each restaurant have identical price but different rank @xmath5 ( agreed by the all the @xmath3 agents ) and can serve only one customer . if more than one agents arrive at any restaurant on any evening , one of them is randomly chosen and is served and the rest do not get dinner that evening .    for the sake of simplicity , let the three agents , alice , bob and charlie have three possible choices : security @xmath6 , security @xmath7 and security @xmath8 .",
    "they receive a payoff @xmath9 if their choice is unique , otherwise they receive @xmath10 . therefore , the game is a one shoot game , that is , it is a non - iterative , and the agents have no information from previous rounds . since the agents can not communicate , therefore , there is nothing left to do other than randomizing between the choices .",
    "randomization gives the agent @xmath11 an expected payoff of @xmath12 , where the superscript @xmath13 represents the classical strategy .    in this problem ,",
    "let alice , bob and charlie share a general tripartite entangled qutrit state of the form@xmath14where the parameter @xmath15 controls the degree of entanglement and @xmath16 in order to analyze the effect of entanglement , another general initial state is also considered as given below@xmath17 and @xmath18  if we set @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the above equation , the three - qutrit state becomes the maximally entangled state .",
    "the strategies of the players can be defined by the unitary operator @xmath22 acting on the initial qutrit state of the problem given as [ 35 ] @xmath23\\]]where @xmath24\\]]and @xmath25\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 after the action of players unitary operators the state of the game transform to @xmath28the evolution of the state of a quantum system in a noisy environment can be described by the super - operator @xmath29 in the kraus operator representation as [ 1 ]    @xmath30    where the kraus operators @xmath31 satisfy the following completeness relation    @xmath32    we have constructed the kraus operators for the game from the single qutrit kraus operators ( as given in equations ( 9 - 11 ) below ) by taking their tensor product over all @xmath33 combination of @xmath34 indices    @xmath35    where @xmath4 is the number of kraus operators for a single qutrit channel .",
    "the single qutrit kraus operators for the amplitude damping channel are given by [ 36 ]    @xmath36    similarly , the single qutrit kraus operators for the phase damping channel are given as [ 36 ]    @xmath37    where @xmath38 the single qutrit kraus operators for the depolarizing channel are given by [ 37 ]    @xmath39    @xmath40    where    @xmath41    the single qutrit kraus operators for the phase flip channel are given by    @xmath42    and the single qutrit kraus operators for the trit - phase flip channel are given by    @xmath43    where @xmath44 represents the quantum noise parameter usually termed as decoherence parameter . here the bounds @xmath45 $ ] of @xmath1 correspond to @xmath46 , @xmath47 respectively .",
