    "particle collisions at very high energies produce quark - quark , quark - gluon and gluon - gluon interactions which result in the production of a multitude of elementary particles .",
    "several of these particles being mesons , baryons and leptons .",
    "this particle production is described in terms of several theoretical and phenomenological models derived from quantum chromodynamics . in high energy collisions ,",
    "particles are visualised to be produced in an intense environment at very high temperature and the formation of quark - gluon plasma in the interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "thus several models use laws of fluid mechanics , statistical mechanics , thermodynamics , hydrodynamics etc . to describe the particle production .",
    "these models have been intriguingly successful .",
    "present day high energy experiments , include several layers of detectors capable of detecting and recording the particles , both neutral and charged , produced in collisions and study the charged particle multipliities , in particular .",
    "the distributions are then matched with predictions from various phenomenological models to understand the production mechanism .",
    "concepts from ensemble theory in statistical mechanics have been used to develop models which include statistical fluctuations as an important source of information .",
    "distributions derived from statistics such as poisson distributions , negative binomial distribution @xcite , @xcite , kno scaling law @xcite etc .",
    "have also played an important role in the understanding of multiplicity distributions , particularly at low energies .",
    "the multiplicity , however does not increase linearly with energy and hence at high energies , several new distributions have been proposed .",
    "some of these include mnbd @xcite , kw @xcite , tsallis @xcite@xcite , gamma @xcite @xcite , log - normal @xcite , weibull @xcite etc . distributions . in the tsallis @xmath1-statistics ,",
    "standard statistical mechanics becomes non - extensive .",
    "the non - extensive property of the entropy is quantified in terms of a parameter @xmath1 which is shown to be more than unity under this assumption .",
    "the non - extensivity property of entropy is used to derive the multiplicity distribution .",
    "weibull distribution is another statistical distribution which has been studied recently @xcite to describe multiplicity distributions in @xmath0 by s. dash et al . in the present study ,",
    "our focus is to investigate the multiplicity distributions , mostly in restricted rapidity windows , at different energies and to study the characteristic properties of charged particle production in @xmath0 collisions . in one of our earlier papers @xcite , we used tsallis distributions to fit @xmath0 data from 34.8 to 206 gev of energy in the full phase space and modified the tsalis distribution to obtain the best fits as compared to several other distributions . in this paper",
    "we will limit ourselves to comparing the distributions using tsallis @xmath1-statistics with the weibull distribution in both restricted rapidity regions as well as in the full phase space to understand the constraints for the models used .",
    "we also propose a modification to improve the comparison between the predicted and the experimental values .",
    "very interesting observations are made .",
    "charged particle multiplicity is defined as the average number of charged particles produced in a collision @xmath2 , where n is the total number of interactions .",
    "angles at which these particles are produced , are measured in terms of rapidity defined as @xmath3 where e is the particle energy and @xmath4 is the longitudinal momentum .",
    "we briefly outline the distributions used to study the multiplicity distributions ;      tsallis statistics deals with entropy in the usual boltzman - gibbs thermo - statistics modified by introducing @xmath1-parameter and is defined as ;    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the probability associated with microstate @xmath7 and sum of the probabilities over all microstates is normalized to one ; @xmath8 .    in tsallis @xmath1- statistics probability",
    "is calculated using the partition function z. tsallis entropy is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath1 is entropic index with value , @xmath10 and @xmath11 measures the departure of entropy from its extensive behaviour .",
    "probability is defined in terms of partition function as    @xmath12    where z represents the total partition function and @xmath13 represents partition function at a particular multiplicity .    for n particles , partition function can be written as    @xmath14    @xmath15 represents the gas density , v is the volume of the system and @xmath16 is the excluded volume .",
    "@xmath17,\\ ] ] @xmath18 represents the average number of particles .",
    "details of the tsallis distribution and how to find the probability distribution can be obtained from @xcite . in one of our earlier papers",
    ", we have analysed the @xmath0 interactions at various energies for full phase space data and described the procedure in detail in reference @xcite .      in our earlier paper @xcite",
    ", we proposed to modify the multiplicity distribution in terms of two components ; one due to multiplicity in 2-jet events and another due to multi - jet events .",
    "we then calculated the probability function from the weighted superposition of tsallis distributions of these two components as described below .",
    "@xmath19    where @xmath20 is a weight factor which gives 2-jet fraction from the total events and is determined from a jet finding algorithm .",
    "weibull distribution is a continuous probability distribution which can take many shapes .",
    "it can also be fitted to non - symmetrical data .",
    "the probability density function of a weibull random variable is ; @xmath21    the standard weibull has characteristic value @xmath22 and shape parameter @xmath23 for its two parameters.the two parameters for the distribution are related to the mean of function , as @xmath24      modified weibull distribution has been obtained by the weighted superposition of two weibull distributions and used to produce the multiplicity distribution .",
    "we convolute the weighted distributions due to 2-jet component and multi - jet components of the events , as below ;    @xmath25    where @xmath20 is the weight factor for 2-jet fraction from the total events and the remaining @xmath26 is the multi - jet fraction .",
    "@xmath20 is calculated from the durham jet algorithm , as discussed in the next section .",
    "experimental data on @xmath0 collisions at different collision energies from different experiments are analysed .",
    "the data used are from the experiments , tasso @xcite , aleph @xcite and delphi @xcite at @xmath27 = 14 , 22 , 34.8 , 44 , 91 gev and from the restricted rapidity windows of @xmath28",

    "the experimental distributions are fitted with the predictions from tsallis @xmath1-statistics and the weibull distribution as described in the following approaches .",
    "the probability distributions using tsallis distribution function and weibull function are calculated using equations ( 3,4,5 ) and ( 7,8 ) and fitted to the experimental data .",
    "figure 1 shows the tsallis fits to the data and figure 2 shows the weibull distributions fitted to the data in different rapidity intervals at various energies . both tsallis and weibull functions",

    "the fit procedure uses root 5.36 from cern to minimise the @xmath34 using minuit .",
