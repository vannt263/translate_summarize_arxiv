    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum of galaxies traces young massive stars , and hence serves as one of the most commonly used star formation rate ( sfr ) indicators ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 , hereafter k98 ) .",
    "however , the severe dust attenuation in the uv significantly weakens its power for measuring the sfr . in nearby star - forming galaxies , the dust attenuation in",
    "the uv can vary from zero to several magnitudes ( e.g. , buat et al . 2005 ; burgarella et al .",
    "2005 ) . for near - uv ( nuv )",
    "selected and far - infrared ( fir ) selected samples , buat et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the median dust attenuations in the far - uv ( fuv ) are 1.1 mag and 2.9 mag respectively ( see also burgarella et al . 2005 ) , corresponding to 64% and 93% obscuration of the fuv light respectively .",
    "corrections for dust attenuation therefore are essential before the uv emission is used to probe the sfr .",
    "commonly two approaches are used to estimate the dust attenuation in the uv .",
    "the power - law slope of the uv continuum @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , at wavelengths 1300 - 2600@xmath7 ; calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ) was the first proposed uv dust attenuation indicator ( e.g. , kinney et al .",
    "1993 ; calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ; meurer et al .",
    "1999 ) , and is based on the assumption that the intrinsic slope @xmath5 is only sensitive to the recent star formation history and any deviation from the intrinsic value is caused by dust attenuation ( e.g. , calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ; meurer et al .",
    "however , once similar analysis is extended from starburst galaxies to normal star - forming galaxies , @xmath5 will depend on the mean age of the dust - heating population , the dust / star geometry , and the dust properties ( e.g. , witt , thronson & capuano 1992 ; witt & gordon 2000 ; granato et al .",
    "2000 ; burgarella et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the other uv dust attenuation estimator is the ratio of ir to uv emission .",
    "this method is built on an energetic budget consideration ( e.g. , meurer et al .",
    "1999 ; buat et al .",
    "according to the energy balance argument , all the starlight absorbed at uv and optical wavebands by the interstellar dust is re - emitted in the ir , so the combination of the ir luminosity and the observed uv luminosity should be able to probe the dust - free uv luminosity ( e.g. , wang & heckman 1996 ; heckman et al .",
    "1998 ) , which then can be used in turn to estimate the dust attenuation by comparing to the observed uv luminosity .",
    "compared to @xmath5 , the ir / uv ratio is a more reliable dust attenuation indicator because it is almost independent of the dust properties and the relative distribution of dust and stars ( e.g. , buat & xu 1996 ; gordon et al . 2000 ; witt & gordon 2000 ; cortese et al . 2008 ) .",
    "however , the ir / uv ratio does depend on the age of the dust heating populations ( e.g. , cortese et al .",
    "2008 ; b. d. johnson et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "the non - ionizing uv emission is mainly from stars younger than a few hundred million years , whereas by contrast the ir emission can be from dust heated by stars over a wide age range , including not only young stars that emit a bulk of their bolometric luminosities in the uv but also evolved stars that radiate only a small fraction of their bolometric energies in the uv or even do not contribute to the uv emission at all .    since the introduction of these two methods many efforts have been made to calibrate the relations between uv attenuation and the ir / uv ratio or @xmath5 ( or equivalently fuv - nuv color ) or the ir / uv versus @xmath5 relation ( e.g. meurer et al .",

    "most of the calibrations are either purely based on theoretical models or based on comparisons of multi - wavelength photometry with stellar population synthesis models .",
    "for example , meurer et al . ( 1999 ) obtained a relationship between fir / fuv and the attenuation at fuv ( @xmath8 ) using the stellar population synthesis models of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) and then they derived an @xmath8@xmath5 relation using this fir / fuv  based @xmath8 for starburst galaxies .",

    "other studies that use different samples or types of galaxies to derive prescriptions for estimating uv attenuation either from ir / uv or from @xmath5 ( or equivalently fuv - nuv color ) include burgarella et al .",
    "2005 , seibert et al . 2005 and cortese et al . 2008 .",
    "as discussed earlier , the ir / uv ratio and the fuv - nuv color are dependent on the age of the dust heating populations , so calibrations based on different samples , regardless of the methods adopted , should account for this age effect . the considerable inconsistencies between the above prescriptions ( see section [ subsec : comparisons ] ) imply that the age difference of the stellar populations of the samples used was largely taken into account , and these prescriptions have been applied widely in the literature to correct for uv attenuations ( e.g. , bell & kennicutt 2001 ; iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "however , the reliability and accuracy of these corrections need to be evaluated using an independent set of attenuation estimates .    in the literature",
    "an independent attenuation estimate , the attenuation in the h@xmath0 line ( a@xmath10 ) as derived from the balmer decrement ratio , has also been used to estimate the attenuation in the uv . to achieve this ,",
    "two methods have been employed .",
    "one is based on the idea that the sfr derived from attenuation - corrected h@xmath0 luminosity matches that from attenuation - corrected uv luminosity ( e.g. , buat et al .",
    "2002 ; treyer et al .",
    "2007 ) . using this method ,",
    "buat et al . ( 2002 ) explored the possibility of using the observed h@xmath0/uv ratio to estimate the uv attenuation .",
    "treyer et al . (",
    "2007 ) employed this method to estimate the uv attenuation and then built an a@xmath11  fuv - nuv relation .",
    "the alternative approach is to obtain a scale factor between the attenuations in the h@xmath0 line and in the uv by assuming a dust attenuation law ( e.g. , buat et al . 2002 ) .",
    "both methods are strongly model - dependent , however , which adds to systematic uncertainties in the results .",
    "the uv attenuation derived using the first method , i.e. , by matching the uv and h@xmath0 derived sfrs , depends not only on the balmer - based attenuation estimates in the h@xmath0 line but also on the conversions of h@xmath0 and uv luminosities to sfrs . on the other hand , the second method rests heavily on the form of the assumed dust attenuation law .    in this paper",
    "we take advantage of the large sets of multi - wavelength observations of nearby galaxies , including uv , ir and optical spectra derived balmer decrement ratios , to calibrate ir / uv and fuv - nuv as uv attenuation estimators empirically in a self - consistent way .",
    "the calibrations derived this way are purely empirical , and depend only weakly on the balmer - derived a@xmath12 .",
    "this paper is the second of a series , in which we aim to use multi - wavelength measurements of nearby galaxies to derive attenuation corrections . in kennicutt",
    "2009 ; hereafter paper i ) , we used the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ; kennicutt et al .",
    "2003 ) and an integrated spectral survey sample from moustakas & kennicutt ( 2006 ; hereafter mk06 ) to calibrate the combinations of the optical emission lines ( h@xmath0 and [ oii]@xmath133727 ) and the ir or radio continuum emission as attenuation - corrected sfr indicators .",
    "we found that the dust attenuation corrected h@xmath0 luminosities , as derived from the balmer decrement ratios , can be closely traced by the combinations of the observed h@xmath0 emission - line luminosities with 24@xmath4 , total ir ( tir ; the bolometric luminosity over the wavelength range 3 - 1100@xmath4 ) , and even 8@xmath4  ir luminosities , with rms scatters @xmath14 0.1 dex .    in this paper",
    "we derive new calibrations for uv attenuation corrections as derived from the ir / uv ratio and the fuv - nuv color as described above , and test the consistency of the sfrs computed from ir / uv or fuv - nuv corrected uv luminosities to those from balmer - corrected h@xmath0 luminosities .",
    "compared to fuv , nuv can be contributed by more evolved stars ( @xmath15 gyr ) .",
    "therefore we mainly focus on fuv in this paper .",
    "but we also explore the reliability of using ir / nuv as a dust attenuation estimator as nuv is sometimes used as a sfr indicator .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the sample , and describe how the uv flux densities were obtained .",
    "the calibrations of the relationships between the attenuation in the fuv and the tir to fuv ratio , the uv color are shown in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we apply the calibrations derived in section 3 to two samples of nearby galaxies to test the reliability of using these attenuation - corrected fuv luminosities as sfr indicators .",
    "second order effects of these attenuation - corrected fuv luminosities relative to the balmer - corrected h@xmath0 luminosities are also investigated in section 4 . at last",
    ", we explore the possibility of using the combinations of fuv with monochromatic mir luminosities 25@xmath4  ( or 24@xmath4 ) and radio continuum to estimate dust attenuations in section 4 . in section 5 , the reliability of using nuv luminosity as a sfr indicator is discussed . in section 6",
    "the limitations and the range of applicability of the use of the calibrations are discussed .",
    "comparisons of our calibrations to those in the literature , to the attenuation curve of calzetti et al .",
    "2000 and to results based on sfr matching method are made in section 6 as well .",
    "finally we summarize our results in section 7 . for distance estimates ,",
    "we assume @xmath16 with local flow corrections .",
    "our galaxies are drawn from the integrated spectrophotometric survey by mk06 and the sings survey .",
    "the survey information and the selection criteria were described in paper i. we briefly list them here for completeness .",
    "the mk06 survey observed 417 galaxies , which were selected to cover the full range of optical spectral characteristics found in the local galaxies , using a long - slit drift - scanning technique .",
    "the reduced spectrum was integrated over a rectangular aperture that includes most or all of the emission of the galaxy .",
    "the sings survey was a multi - wavelength survey from the fuv to the fir and it was composed of 75 nearby galaxies that cover wide ranges in morphological type , luminosity , star formation rate and dust opacity . in this paper series",
    "we aim to use attenuation - corrected h@xmath0 luminosities , as derived from balmer decrement ratios , to calibrate combinations of optical emission lines or uv continuum and the ir or radio continuum as dust attenuation corrected sfr indicators .",
    "therefore several criteria were employed to ensure the quality of the data ( 1 ) galaxies without detectable h@xmath0 emission were excluded , ( 2 ) in order to obtain reliable measurements of the balmer decrement ratios , galaxies with low signal to noise ratio spectra at h@xmath5 ( s / n @xmath17 15 ) were removed , ( 3 ) galaxies classified as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or agn - starburst composites ( c.f .",

    "some of the galaxies used in paper i have not been observed by the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ; martin et al .",

    "similar to paper i , ir data and the attenuation corrected h@xmath0 luminosities from h@xmath0/h@xmath5 ratios are required .",

    "spitzer / mips 24@xmath4  measurements were also performed for the central 20  @xmath20 20  regions of the sings galaxies in paper i , and they are also used in this paper ( section [ sec : other ] ) .    for galaxies selected from the mk06 sample , we identified their counterparts in the uv from galex gr4 .",
    "galex performs imaging observations at fuv and nuv bands , centered at 1528@xmath7  and 2271@xmath7  respectively , with a circular field of view of @xmath21 diameter ( martin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "gr4 includes images taken from the all - sky imaging survey ( ais ) , medium imaging survey ( mis ) , nearby galaxies survey ( ngs ) , deep imaging survey ( dis ) and guest investigators survey ( gi ) . since artifacts appear",
    "much more frequently at the edge of the field of view , only galaxies within a radius of @xmath22 from the field center were selected ( morrissey et al . 2007 ) .",
    "because of the overlap in coverage of these surveys , sometimes there were more than one image available . in such cases , we used the one with the longest exposure time in the fuv .",
    "after this process we were left with 98 galaxies ( 54 in ais , 4 in mis , 22 in ngs , 2 in dis and 16 in gi ) out of the 113 star - forming galaxies selected from the mk06 sample . but ngc1003 , which is in ais , was excluded later because of artifact contamination in its fuv image .",

    ". another two extreme examples are dwarf irregulars and ( ultra)luminous infrared galaxies ( ( u)lirgs ) .",

    "similar to dwarf / irregulars , at a given fuv - nuv color , the ( u)lirgs span more than an order of magnitude in irx .",
    "one assumption we made in our calibration method is that the attenuation derived from irx matches that estimated from fuv - nuv color , which is reasonable for our normal star - forming galaxy sample given the relatively tight correlation between irx and fuv - nuv color , as shown in figure [ irxfuv.uvcolor.eps ] .",
    "however , it breaks down for dwarf irregulars and ( ultra)luminous infrared galaxies given the large range of irx spanned by these galaxies at a given fuv - nuv color . therefore no attempt was made to calibrate an irx - based and fuv - nuv color - based attenuation correction prescriptions for these galaxies .",
    "apart from different galaxy samples , the differences between different calibrations can be traced to the different methodologies .",
    "previous calibrations have been based either on pure model assumptions , or on a comparison of observational data with models .",

    "by contrast , in starburst galaxies , the dust is dominantly heated by stellar populations younger than 100 myr ( meurer et al .",
    "this difference in dust - heating stellar populations of starbursts and our star - forming galaxies results in the difference in attenuation estimates , 0.3 mag at maximum over @xmath120 irx @xmath121 , as shown in figure [ comparebuatsbresifuv.eps ] .",
    "the effects on the uv color - based corrections are much larger than on irx - based prescriptions .",
    "the irx - based prescriptions are surprisingly consistent with each other .",

    "this underscores our concerns about color - based attenuation corrections based on scatter in our own data .    in principle , by comparing modelled seds with multi - wavelength data , the differences in star formation histories and dust attenuation curves can be taken into account on a galaxy - to - galaxy basis .",
    "however , the dust attenuations derived this way and the resulting relations of @xmath46 versus irx or @xmath46 versus fuv - nuv color are dependent on the adopted stellar population synthesis models and the dust attenuation curves . on the other hand ,",
    "the requirement of the availability of large libraries of models and multi - wavelength data makes this method less practical in many cases .",
    "by contrast , our approach is more straightforward and less model - dependent .",
    "our calibrations rely almost entirely on the data themselves and hence can serve as independent checks of other model - dependent methods . although we assumed an average stellar population and dust attenuation curve ( as discussed in section [ sec : calibration ] ) , they do not introduce systematics into the calibrations and are valid on a statistical basis .",
    "therefore , our calibrations should be robust .",
    "they also tend to be consistent with most of the published calibrations for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "the last possible systematic error comes from the tir luminosities we adopted in our calibrations .",
    "we used tir luminosities based on iras observations , which are systematically lower than those based on spitzer / mips measurements by @xmath147 on average ( section [ sec : sample ] and figure 1 in paper i ) . if we simply substitute the iras tir luminosities by the mips tir luminosities , the coefficient in front of irx in eq .",

    "our irx - based attenuation correction has an uncertainty of @xmath148 mag , when it is applied to starburst galaxies or to galaxies with mips based tir luminosities .",
    "by contrast , if one uses our fuv - nuv color prescription to estimate the fuv attenuation for starbursts , he can underestimate the fuv attenuation by more than 1 - 2 mag .",
