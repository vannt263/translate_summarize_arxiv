    "the study of electrons phase coherence in mesoscopic systems has been an active field in the past few years .",
    "one of the main contributions to the loss of quasi - particle phase coherence ( or dephasing ) at low temperatures are electron - electron interactions .",
    "thus , measurements of the low temperatures dephasing rate provide us with a valuable probe to gauge our understanding of the structure of the many - electron ground state .",
    "in particular , the nature of the many - body wave function in confined geometries was predicted to change sharply at low excitation energies , where the wave function is expected to be localized in fock space  @xcite .",
    "consequently , one expects the dephasing rate to vanish at some finite temperature , which scales like @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mean - level spacing and  @xmath2 is the dimensionless thouless conductance of the system .",
    "the prediction of vanishing dephasing rate in isolated dots is of great importance in light of the search for systems with long coherence times to be used as storage units in quantum computers .",
    "however , it was claimed that the logarithmic correction , and maybe even the existence of the transition are artifacts of various approximations done in the process of mapping the many - body hamiltonian onto the localization problem  @xcite .",
    "thus , an experimental verification of this localization transition , through measurements of the dephasing rate in closed ( i.e. , nearly isolated ) quantum dots , is desirable for both theoretical and applicative reasons .",
    "whereas there are a number of ways to measure the dephasing times of thermalized states in open quantum dots , the situation is much more complicated in closed dots .",
    "folk  et  al .",
    "@xcite have measured the magneto - conductance and used it as a probe for dephasing times .",
    "subsequent theoretical analysis  @xcite has yielded some numerical estimates of the dephasing times , and a clear @xmath1 dependence was observed .",
    "however , it turns out that the magneto - conductance is not sensitive enough in the low - temperature regime . although the results of folk  et  al .",
    "are certainly consistent with vanishing dephasing rates at low temperatures , they do not exclude other scenarios .    a renewed interest in charge and current fluctuations and their full counting statistics ( fcs ) has arisen recently .",
    "these quantities provide additional insight into transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "for example , it has been pointed out that the noise of the transferred charge is suppressed in non - interacting conductors and simple quantum dots , as compared to the classical poisson statistics  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the shot noise is strongly enhanced in interacting quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "the full counting statistics of currents in such mesoscopic systems thus yields a great deal of information on the underlying electronic processes , much beyond what is revealed by the averaged current alone .    in this work",
    "we suggest to use the current fluctuations as a probe of electron dephasing in closed quantum dots . for simplicity , we focus on a two - level model , where dephasing is manifested through the change of the energy state of the dot .",
    "we use the noise - to - mean ratio , known as the fano factor  ( @xmath3 ) , as a convenient measure of the shot noise .",
    "the classical shot - noise problem , with independent and uncorrelated events , has poisson statistics , where the fano factor equals one . as mentioned above , a single - level quantum dot exhibits suppressed noise , i.e.  .",
    "the two level system , on the other hand , displays super - poissonian noise , due to the _ dynamical channel blockade _  @xcite .",
    "here we examine how this noise enhancement depends on the dephasing rate , i.e. the coupling between the channels .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we present the model describing the closed two - level quantum dot , and arrive at a general expression for the fano factor . in section",
    "[ sec : zero ] we proceed to discuss charge transport in the zero bias limit .",
    "it is shown that the fano factor exhibits a sharp peak as a function of the leads chemical potential , the characteristics of which can be related to the dephasing rate . in section  [ sec : intuitive ] we provide a qualitative description of the random transport process , and in section  [ sec : rmt ] we show that the effect survives ensemble averaging .",
    "we describe the closed quantum dot  ( qd ) as a double - barrier potential well with two energy levels in the transport window ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , neglecting the influence of all other energy states of the dot .",
    "electrons can transport through the dot by means of tunneling through the barriers .",
    "dephasing in this isolated regime is manifested through inelastic scattering between the two levels within the dot .",
    "an electron in the excited state , with energy @xmath5 , can decay to the ground state , @xmath4 , with the rate @xmath6 , while an electron in the ground state can be scattered to the excited state with the rate @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the energy spacing between the two states , @xmath9 is the electron temperature and @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "this relation between the excitation and decay rates is dictated by detailed balance .",
    "the dot is in the coulomb blockade degenerate regime , where the charge on the dot can fluctuate between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the dot can be found in one of three possible states ; @xmath13  where the dot is empty , and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , where one of the two energy levels is occupied .",
    "the simultaneous occupation of both energy levels is forbidden by coulomb blockade .",
    "the transition rates between the occupied states @xmath14 and the empty state @xmath13 are and , where @xmath16 is the tunneling rate between the state @xmath14 and lead  @xmath17 ( left or right ) , @xmath18 is the fermi occupation function in the lead , , and @xmath19 is the chemical potential in the lead .",
    "the factor  @xmath20 accounts for the two spin states in each energy level in the dot .    within the sequential tunneling limit",
    ", electron dynamics can be described through the master equation formulation . in order to find the full counting statistics , we follow bagrets and nazarov  @xcite and add counting fields @xmath21 to the rates involving the change of the dot s excess charge from @xmath22 to @xmath23 ( `` incoming '' events ) .",
    "the cumulant generating function is then proportional to the smallest eigenvalue of the modified rates matrix , , as long as @xmath24 , the duration of a single experiment , is longer then the average dwell time in the dot .",
    "the cumulants are given by @xmath25 .",
    "applying this approach to the general two level case , one obtains the fano factor    @xmath26    @xmath27    the fano factor does depend on the dephasing rate @xmath6 , so in principle it can be used to determine this rate experimentally , provided all the other parameters are known .",
    "however , the dependence on the various parameters is much too complex to allow for a practical use of this formula . in the next section we focus on the zero bias regime , and",
    "present a setup where the expression for @xmath28 can be greatly simplified .",
    "within the zero bias limit , the average current through the dot vanishes .",
    "however , electrons do transport between the island and the leads due to charge fluctuations on the dot , and examination of the `` entries '' statistics does yield non - trivial information .",
    "the tunneling rates now take the form @xmath29 alternatively , one can study the setup where one of the contacts is pinched off , leaving the dot in contact with a single lead , as illustrated in fig .  [",

    "two distinct regimes are observed .",
    "when the chemical potential in the leads ,  @xmath31 , is within the range of @xmath32 near the ground level , noise is suppressed below the poisson value , in agreement with previous observations and predictions in single - level dots  @xcite . in this case",
    "the excited level does nt effect the transport , as its energy is far above the chemical potential .",
    "accordingly , no dephasing effects are observed .",
    "however , when both energy levels are below the chemical potential , @xmath33 , and the two transport channels are distinguishable ( i.e. , the tunneling rates through them are different ) , the role of dephasing is revealed .    for @xmath31 in the vicinity of the excited level ,",
    "strong noise enhancement is observed at low dephasing rates , @xmath34 , and a peak appears in the fano factor as a function of chemical potential .",
    "the height of the peak , as well as its location , clearly depend on the dephasing rate , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fano , ev=0](a ) . as",
    "dephasing grows stronger the noise is suppressed , reaching the limit of @xmath35 when dephasing rates are very high .",

    "[ fig : fano , ev=0](b ) the role of the ratio between the two tunneling rates @xmath36 and @xmath37 is demonstrated ; the noise enhancement is stronger when the excited level has stronger coupling with the leads . as this coupling becomes weaker , the influence of the second level can be neglected , leading to the poissonian noise of a single level dot .    following these findings",
    ", we now look for a more convenient expression for the fano factor , in order to characterize the dependence of the peak s location on the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "expanding  ( [ eq : fano , full ] ) to the leading order in @xmath38 in the super - poissonian regime , where @xmath33 , leads to @xmath39 in order to determine the location of the peak , @xmath40 , we use the fact that the fermi occupation function @xmath41 is almost constant in the super - poissonian regime , and so the line shape of @xmath28 is determined predominantly by the change of the function @xmath42 . using this approximation ,",

    "the super - poissonian behavior in the zero - bias regime can be intuitively understood within the dynamical channel blockade picture of ref .  .",
    "the super - poissonian statistics is most pronounced at low temperatures for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fano , ev=0 ] . in this case",
    "the fano factor reaches its maximum value at @xmath65 _ above _ the excited resonant level @xmath5 , and the transport is dominated by the two processes illustrated in  [ fig : time - trace](a , b ) , where an empty dot is occupied quickly , entering one of the two allowed states . due to the low coupling between the states ,",
    "an electron is most likely to remain in the same state until it exits the dot .",
    "the entry rate is considerably faster then the exit rate , so one can ignore the time it takes an electron to enter the dot , and thus in both processes ( a ) and ( b ) the time intervals between entries are distributed exponentially .",
    "most of the states in the lead at the energy @xmath4 are occupied , and therefore an electron in the ground level has a lower exit rate then one in the excited state . thus the process is a combination of two exponential processes , one of them faster then the other .    within this picture ,",
    "the time evolution of the dot s occupation is as follows : an empty dot is occupied immediately .",
    "if the electron enters the ground state , transport is blocked for the longer time scale @xmath66 until the electron leaves the dot ( process  ( a ) ) .",
    "if the excited state is entered , transport is blocked for a much shorter period ( process  ( b ) ) .",
    "a series of such `` fast '' transitions would seem as a bunch of electrons tunneling into the dot and out of it at practically the same time .",
    "each time an electron leaves the dot is registered as an `` event '' on the time - trace plotted in  fig .  [",

    "the resulting statistics display positive correlation between events , giving rise to a super - poissonian distribution .",
    "now the role of dephasing can be easily interpreted : inelastic scattering events bring about a finite probability for an excited dot to decay into the ground state , thus increasing the probability of terminating a cycle of fast events . as a result ,",
    "the clusters become shorter and the correlation weaker . at high dephasing rates",
    "the transport is effectively governed by a single exponential process , just like the classical shot - noise , resulting in a poissonian distribution .    .",
    "in ( c ) the entire experiment is shown , where the stems are registered events . in the finer resolution in ( d ) the fast processes can be seen . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    following the above description , one looks at two transport channels with different `` conductances '' , one significantly larger then the other .",
    "it is possible to derive the full counting statistics of the transport process in this case , which leads to the fano factor , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the probability to tunnel through the open channel  @xcite . in a qd with a single contact and @xmath63",

    "note however , that this reasoning can be applied at low temperatures and low dephasing rates only , where it is reasonable to assume exponentially distributed processes in both channels .",
    "when either temperature or dephasing are higher a sequence of several transitions could occur between two subsequent counts , such as @xmath71 , where only the two transitions that involve @xmath13 as the initial state are registered .",
    "the time intervals in this scenario have a much more complicated distribution .",
