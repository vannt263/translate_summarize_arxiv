    "that there is a profound relationship between order and lorentzian geometry has been evident ever since the work of malament , hawking and others @xcite where they showed the existence of a bijection between the causal structure , itself a partially ordered set , and the conformal class of the spacetime metric .",
    "this is one of the main motivations for the causal set approach to quantum gravity , which assumes that the primitive structure underlying spacetime is a locally finite partially ordered set , or causal set @xcite . instead of considering the spacetime metric as the fundamental dynamical variable in causal set theory ( cst )",
    "it is the causal structure that one wishes to `` quantise '' .",
    "however , to recover the full spacetime geometry from the causal structure , there must be a way to obtain the spacetime volume or equivalently , the conformal factor .",
    "this is achieved in cst via the condition of `` local finiteness '' which implies a fundamental spacetime discreteness : underlying every finite volume region of spacetime is a finite cardinality causal set .",
    "thus , the continuum - discrete correspondence in cst is not exact but approximate , with the continuum being the approximation of the underlying causal set .    in order to maintain the relationship between volume and cardinality in all",
    "coordinate systems , a causal set @xmath2 approximated by a spacetime @xmath3 is obtained via the following random , poisson discretisation of @xmath3 @xcite . given a fundamental scale @xmath4 ( which could be the planck volume ) the probability that a spacetime region of volume @xmath5 contains @xmath6 elements of @xmath7 is given by the poisson distribution @xmath8 for which @xmath9 thus establishing the required number to volume correspondence . to give credence to the existence of a fundamental spacetime discreteness cst",
    "moreover requires the following conjecture .",
    "namely , if a causal set @xmath2 approximates to a spacetime @xmath3 , then @xmath3 is unique , up to modifications to it on scales @xmath10 . in other words",
    ", this conjectures that _ all _ the meaningful information about the geometry and topology of @xmath3 at scales @xmath11 is contained in the causal set ; continuum information below these scales is irrelevant since the discrete substructure , i.e. , the causal set , is fundamental .    from a purely mathematical point of view",
    ", this conjecture is very intriguing .",
    "while it has been verified in several different cases a general proof is still not known , though considerable progress has been made in this direction @xcite .",
    "a key question is how to extract continuum topological and geometric properties from @xmath2 using purely order theoretic information .",
    "uniqueness of the approximating spacetime with respect to a _ given _",
    "geometric or topological property then follows , i.e. , any two spacetimes which are approximations to @xmath2 must share this property on scales @xmath12 .",
    "for example , for a causal set @xmath2 that is approximated by flat spacetime , the myrheim - meyer dimension gives a good estimate of the spacetime dimension @xcite , while the length of the longest chain or total order between elements in @xmath2 gives a good estimate of the time - like distance @xcite .",
    "an estimator for spatial distance in this case has also been obtained @xcite .",
    "additionally , the homology of spatial hypersurfaces can be constructed from the causal set underlying a globally hyperbolic spacetime @xcite .",
    "a very important recent result is the construction of the scalar curvature from which the causal set action is obtained @xcite .",
    "a natural question to ask of the flat spacetime results of @xcite is how they are modified in the presence of curvature .",
    "while it is true in the continuum that a sufficiently small neighbourhood of a point is approximately flat , the corrections from curvature can in fact be well quantified using riemann normal coordinates in a convex normal neighbourhood of any point .",
    "however , we run into the following issue in the discrete case : there is at present no known purely order theoretic definition of a `` small '' neighbourhood of an element in a causal set which corresponds to a convex normal neighbourhood . at best it may be possible to find approximately flat subsets in a causal set but it is still unclear how to do this in a systematic way @xcite",
    "this issue however will not be the focus of our current investigation .",
    "instead we consider only those @xmath6-element causal sets @xmath2 which are approximated by a small causal diamond or alexandrov interval @xmath13 $ ] in a generic curved spacetime @xmath3 , where the smallness parameter is given by the proper time @xmath14 between the events @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we expand the metric in riemann normal coordinates ( rnc ) about an origin @xmath17 @xmath18 where the @xmath19 correction to the metric vanishes since @xmath20 .",
    "the rnc has been used to calculate the volume of a small interval @xmath13 $ ] @xcite for which the first order correction to the volume of @xmath13 $ ] due to the effect of curvature occurs at @xmath21 .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is meyer s work @xcite in which a general expression was found for the average abundance @xmath22 of @xmath1-chains or @xmath1-element total orders in a causal set @xmath23 which is approximated by an alexandroff interval @xmath24}$ ] in flat spacetime .",
    "following myrheim , meyer used this to find a dimension estimator for the dimension of @xmath24}$ ] employing only @xmath25 , the average abundance of elements in @xmath24}$ ] and @xmath26 , the average abundance of relations . using the rnc expansion and with the help of @xcite we extend this analysis to the curved spacetime case .",
    "we find that the @xmath22 in @xmath13 $ ] satisfy a recursion relation and depend on the scalar curvature @xmath27 and the time - time component of the ricci tensor @xmath28 .",
    "it is then an easy exercise to invert these relations and find expressions for @xmath27 and @xmath28 in terms of @xmath29 for fixed spacetime dimension .",
    "we find that the myrheim - meyer dimension estimator is insufficient to determine dimension in a generic curved spacetime and construct a new dimension estimator for generic non - flat spacetimes using @xmath30 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the scalar curvature of an element in a causal set was first calculated by benincasa and dowker @xcite using a curved spacetime expression for a non - local dalembertian on a causal set .",
    "they showed that @xmath31 for an element @xmath16 in the @xmath2 can be expressed in terms of the abundance of k - element `` inclusive - intervals '' which are order theoretically very distinct from @xmath1-chains . like @xmath1-chains",
    "they too have a bottom element @xmath32 and a top element @xmath33 , but unlike @xmath1-chains , every element in the interval @xmath34 $ ] which is the intersection of the future of @xmath35 and the past of @xmath33 belongs to the inclusive interval , and has precisely @xmath36 elements satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast , the expression for @xmath27 that we find depends only on the abundance of @xmath1-chains .",
    "this may suggest that for manifold - like causal sets there are hidden relations between these seemingly different order theoretic entities .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in section [ stwo ] after first presenting some basic definitions , we reproduce meyer s results for the @xmath0 thus setting the notation that we will use in the rest of the paper . in section [ sthree ]",
    "we present the main calculation in the paper , where we use the rnc to obtain the lowest order curvature correction to @xmath0 .",
    "we show that there is a recursion relation between the coefficients in the expression for the different @xmath0 , but that the form of the dependence on the @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the same for all @xmath1 . in section [ sfour ] for a fixed spacetime dimension",
    "we find expressions for @xmath27 and @xmath28 which depend only on @xmath38 .",
    "the coefficients in these expressions again have a simple dependence on dimension . in section [ sfive ]",
    "we point out that the myrheim - meyer dimension estimator is insufficient in a generic curved spacetime and find a new dimension estimator using @xmath39 .",
    "an important question in these calculations is how the error decreases with the sprinkling density @xmath40 ( i.e. , the inverse of the volume cut - off )  the larger @xmath40 is the closer one comes to the continuum . in section [ ssix ] using the technique developed in @xcite we show that the error in @xmath0 grows as @xmath41 which means that the error in @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath42 goes like @xmath43 , thus going to zero in the continuum limit .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in section [ sseven ] and the questions that need to be addressed in the future .",
    "finally , the appendix contains explicit calculations of the results that appear in the main body of the paper .",
    "a @xmath1-chain in a causal set @xmath2 is a @xmath1-element total order , i.e. , a set of elements @xmath44 , @xmath45 such that @xmath46 for all @xmath47 . for any finite element @xmath2 ,",
    "the number @xmath48 of @xmath1-chains is therefore invariant of the choice of labeling of @xmath2 .",
    "this makes @xmath48 a good observable .",
    "note that the @xmath49 and @xmath50 need not be `` linked '' , i.e. , there could exist an element @xmath51 such that @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , @xmath53 does not imply that @xmath54 belongs to the @xmath1-chain .",
    "in contrast , a @xmath1-inclusive interval is defined as @xmath55= { \\mathrm { future}}(e_1 ) \\cap { \\mathrm { past}}(e_{k } ) $ ] @xcite .",
    "along with the elements @xmath56 it also contains precisely @xmath1-elements . however , every @xmath51 such that @xmath53 belongs to @xmath57 $ ] , which means that the order theoretic structure of a @xmath1-chain is very different from that of a @xmath1-inclusive interval .",
    "the fact that one can express the discrete scalar curvature both in terms of the abundance of the inclusive intervals as shown by benincasa and dowker @xcite and in terms of the abundance of @xmath1-chains as we will show in section [ sfour ] thus suggests a hidden connection between the two .",

    "the first is simply that there are no coincidences , i.e. , that all 4 points @xmath194 are distinct , which gives a contribution @xmath195 .",
    "although this term @xmath196 , it cancels out in the expression for the variance and therefore plays no role . the next type is the one - coincidence case .",

    "since the no - coincidence term cancels out , @xmath225 .",
    "a similar analysis shows that for @xmath226 the no - coincidence term cancels out and the one - coincidence cases lead to a dependence @xmath227 , so that @xmath228 this generalises in a straightforward manner to @xmath229    we are now in a position to calculate the dependence on @xmath40 of the errors in the @xmath143 and @xmath176 : @xmath230 and @xmath231 this immediately means that the errors @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 go as @xmath43 and hence become smaller as @xmath40 increases .",
    "the error in the dimension estimator is similarly given by @xmath235",
    "in this work we have found expressions for the proper time @xmath14 ( eqn ( [ t ] ) ) , the scalar curvature @xmath27 ( eqn ( [ r ] ) ) , the time - time component of the ricci tensor @xmath28 ( eqn ( [ roo ] ) ) , and a new dimension estimator ( eqn ( [ dim ] ) ) from a causal set underlying a small causal diamond @xmath13 $ ] in a generic spacetime in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we find that the errors in these estimators goes as @xmath43 , thus becoming smaller as the sprinkling density is increased , while keeping the volume of @xmath13 $ ] fixed .",
    "our results not only verify the deep relationship between order and lorentzian geometry , but also provide new observables that can be used to assess whether a causal set is manifold - like or not .",
    "our calculation moreover brings to light an intriguing connection between two seemingly disparate order theoretic structures in a causal set . while our expression for the scalar curvature is purely in terms of the abundance of @xmath1-chains , the benincasa - dowker(bd ) scalar curvature @xmath236 @xcite is constructed from the abundance of @xmath1-inclusive intervals . in @xmath165-dimensions for example , their expression for the scalar curvature is @xmath237 where @xmath238 are the number of @xmath1-inclusive intervals @xmath239 $ ] , where @xmath240 is replaced by @xmath241 , in keeping with our definition of a @xmath1-chain . ] . as noted in section [ stwo ] , @xmath1-chains and @xmath1-inclusive intervals are very distinct order theoretic structures .",
    "the continuum geometry however seems to link them via the scalar curvature .",
    "if such a relationship exists , does it for example indicate manifold - likeness in a causal set ?",
    "this and several related questions remain to be investigated .    further comparisons between the two expressions for @xmath27 are warranted .",
    "both contain alternating sums , although the coefficients differ markedly .",
    "for one , the bd expression appears to have a strong dimension dependence in the number of terms required  for @xmath242 the sum is truncated at @xmath243 , while for @xmath244 it is truncated at @xmath245 .",
    "our expression for @xmath27 is in this sense independent of @xmath42  it requires @xmath246 in _ all _ dimensions with any other @xmath247 , to get an expression for @xmath27 in terms of @xmath248 .",
    "what is important is that this choice is not dimension dependent  every choice works for every @xmath42 . ] .",
    "moreover , the systematic determination of the coefficients for @xmath236 for arbitrary @xmath42 is fairly involved , whereas the coefficients in eqn ( [ r ] ) and eqn ( [ u ] ) are simply the binomial coefficients @xmath249 and @xmath250 , respectively , in all dimensions .    apart from these , there are deeper differences in the two expressions for @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath251 is constructed from _ all _ inclusive intervals of the form @xmath239 $ ] in the causal set for @xmath252 .",
    "it is therefore an essentially non - local expression since it depends on the structure of the causal set throughout a past ( or future ) neighbourhood of the element @xmath253 in the causal set .",
    "the expression eqn ( [ r ] ) on the other hand is _ only _ valid in a small causal diamond , and hence is strictly local and dependent on a proper choice of neighbourhood of the element in the causal set .",
    "this means that the bd form for @xmath27 , being `` neighbourhood independent '' , can be readily used to obtain an action for the entire causal set , which has strong implications for causal set theory .",
    "unless the definition of a small neighbourhood can be made entirely order theoretically in the causal set , our expression for @xmath27 on the other hand can not be used to obtain an action in a simple manner .",
    "of course , in the _ specific _ case when the entire causal set is approximated by a small causal diamond @xmath13 $ ] the action is simply @xmath254 where @xmath255 denotes an element in @xmath2 , since to this approximation @xmath256 is the same throughout @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "nevertheless , the geometric estimators we have found in this work take a big step towards the order - lorentzian geometry correspondence .",
    "we have a new dimension estimator which can determine the manifold dimension for a curved spacetime with greater accuracy than the currently available flat spacetime myrheim - meyer estimator .",
    "the local nature of the expression for the scalar curvature can also be seen as an advantage since only a small neighbourhood of an element in the causal set is required to determine the curvature , rather the than its entire past .",
    "an obvious next step is to follow up with a numerical analysis of causal sets which are approximated by different curved spacetimes and to see how well our estimators work in these cases @xcite .",
    "these observables can also be used as additional tests of manifold - likeness of a causal set . in @xcite",
    "the expectation values of a range of such observables , including the abundance @xmath257 of @xmath1-element inclusive intervals was found from monte carlo simulations of 2-d causal set quantum gravity . comparing with the flat spacetime distribution of the @xmath257 ,",
    "these observables were used to demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the causal set path integral in 2d comes from flat spacetime suggesting that manifold - like behaviour is emergent .",
    "the estimators we have obtained in this current work could well be employed to calculate more accurately how close to flatness one is  is the 2-d universe just a little positively curved , for example ?",
    "the extended hope of the current analysis is also that as more of the order theoretic basis of geometry is uncovered it may be possible to find a meaningful order theoretic definition of locality which translates to our commonly held ( albeit riemannian geometry based ) notions of locality in the continuum .",
    "to evaluate the @xmath0 we find it convenient to transform from the cartesian coordinates @xmath258 to spherical polar coordinates @xmath259 , where @xmath260 it is also useful to express the radial coordinate for any @xmath261 $ ] in light - cone coordinates : @xmath262 since the metric @xmath263 in @xmath24}$ ] in light cone coordinates is @xmath264 the associated measure of any integral over @xmath24}$ ] is @xmath265 finally , we will find it useful to define the following pair of integrals : @xmath266      1 .",
    "@xmath267 2 .",
    "for @xmath268 the above equation gives us the relation @xmath269 3 .   as noted in section [ sthree ]",
    "any integral of the form @xmath270 } }   dx _ 1 ( x_1^i)^2 t_1^m\\ ] ] is independent of the spatial direction @xmath47 because of the spatial symmetry of @xmath24}$ ] .",
    "thus , we can choose @xmath271 to simplify our calculation so that @xmath272 the next integral can be split into three parts @xmath273 where , using @xmath274 @xmath275 @xmath276 and @xmath277 after some algebra , we find that @xmath278 4 .",
