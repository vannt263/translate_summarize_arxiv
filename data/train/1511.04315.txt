    "many different mathematical models have been proposed to study an evolutionary self - governing system . in the last several decades , a particular attention was devoted to those that are based on simple generating rules that produce complex outcomes .",
    "such an example is the growing model based on the numerical @xmath3-rule introduced in  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the numbers are recorded in cells and , for simplicity , we keep the unidirectional development of future generations , composed of children @xmath8 born from parents @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which are neighbor cells in the previous generation .    for a plastic representation of the @xmath3-rule  , one can think that any cell containing a positive integer @xmath11 is a citadel composed of towers .",
    "there are as many towers in the citadel as prime factors @xmath11 has .",
    "each tower is associated to a prime and the height of the tower corresponding to a prime @xmath12 that divides @xmath11 equals the power of @xmath12 in the factor decomposition of @xmath11 . in particular , the citadel of a cell containing the number @xmath13 has no towers at all .",
    "likewise , one may think that the citadel @xmath11 has towers associated to the primes that do not divide @xmath11 also , but these towers have zero height .",
    "then , the @xmath3-rule topples the towers of the neighbor citadels @xmath9 and @xmath10 creating a new citadel @xmath8 in the next generation .",
    "the towers of the new citadel have heights equal with the absolute difference of the heights of towers corresponding to the same prime in @xmath9 and @xmath10 and , if a prime divides only one of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then this tower is reproduced unchanged in the new citadel .",
    "the process starts with a sequence of numbers @xmath2 , which may be finite or not , which are placed in a row of cells .",
    "this sequence is called the initial generation and the @xmath3-rule is applied sequentially on each two consecutive terms of @xmath2 .",
    "whence , a new generation is born and its cells are placed in the following row . usually , in graphic representations , we slightly shift to the right the new generation such that any new cell is placed in the middle under its parents . repeating the process",
    ", we obtain a matrix @xmath14 with infinitely many rows if @xmath2 is infinite . as the reproducing rule remains unchanged , the results depend only on the initial generations and we shall see that in this way a large variety of outcomes are produced .",
    "the matrices of numbers @xmath14 have lots of features of which some are similar to the objects created by the abelian sandpile model proposed by bak , tang and wiesenfeld  @xcite .",
    "the intensely studied model , also called the chip - firing game , was surveyed by levine and propp  @xcite .",
    "our @xmath3-model also captures features of other evolutionary systems such as the ducci - type game  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the numerical ensembles created by median insertions , such as those related to pascal triangle   @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or the farey sequences  @xcite , @xcite . for many initial generations @xmath2 ,",
    "the matrices @xmath14 show complex self - similar structures , like those of some particular abelian sandpile states @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite or the outcomes produced in the related rotor - router model  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a special feature of matrices @xmath4 is the fact that they can be localized . for any prime @xmath12 , the _",
    "@xmath12-tomography _ is the matrix of citadels of @xmath4 in which all towers , except the towers associated to @xmath12 , are deleted .",
    "then @xmath14 is the superposition ( the element - wise multiplication ) of the @xmath12-tomographies for all primes @xmath12 , since the evolution according to the @xmath3-rule is independent to one another .",
    "we have already proved in  @xcite that the @xmath3-rule produces objects with a fractal aspect if @xmath2 is the sequence of prime numbers or its localized slice , the sequence of zeros except one term that is equal to a prime @xmath12 . in this article",
    "we show that this also happens if the initial generation is the @xmath12-spaced sequence @xmath15 , where @xmath16 or @xmath17 , the @xmath12-section of positive integers , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath12__-valuation _ _ of @xmath11 , which is , the power of @xmath12 into the prime decomposition .",
    "the classic sierpinski fractal appears if @xmath20 ( a finite fragment is shown in figure  [ figtomo2 ] ) , while more complex self - similar patterns are typical for larger primes ( see figures  [ figtomo13 - 19][figtomo5 ] ) .",
    "always , in a graphical representation , we present only a triangular region of @xmath4 , the one composed by the cells born in future generations from the part of @xmath2 shown on the first row .",
