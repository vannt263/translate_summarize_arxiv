    "black hole x - ray transients ( bhts ) are black hole x - ray binaries which usually show relatively short ( week to months ) outbursts , separated by long periods of quiescence . during an outburst ,",
    "both timing and spectral properties vary .",
    "these changes are used to define different states ( see belloni , motta & muoz - darias 2011 for a review ) . in the low / hard state ( lhs ) , observed at the beginning and at the end of the outburst ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum is dominated by a component which can be approximated by a power law with a photon index of @xmath1 and a high - energy cut - off at @xmath2 kev . the power density spectrum ( pds ) in",
    "the lhs features a high level of aperiodic variability with a fractional root mean square ( rms ) amplitude usually above @xmath3 and often a quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) . in the high / soft state ( hss )",
    "the aperiodic variability drops to values of few per cent and the energy spectrum becomes softer and dominated by a thermal disc - blackbody component .",
    "the hss is usually observed in the middle of the outburst . in between these two states",
    "the situation is more complex , with hard - to - soft and soft - to - hard transitions usually taking place on relatively short time - scales ( hours to days ) and associated with dramatic changes in the timing and spectral properties .",
    "two additional states can be identified , the hard - intermediate state ( hims ) and the soft - intermediate state ( sims ) .    a widely used tool to study the spectral evolution of bhts in outburst is the x - ray hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) , in which different spectral states correspond to different branches / areas of a q - shaped hid pattern ( homan et al .",
    "2001 ) . during an outburst",
    ", bhts are usually observed in all the four states defined above . however , `` hard outbursts '' are also observed ( brocksopp , bandyopadhyay & fender 2004 ) : in this case the bht spends the whole outburst in the lhs , or in the lhs and in the hims ( e.g. h  1743 - 322 ; capitanio et al .",
    "2009 ) without transiting to the soft states .",
    "it is worth noting that some sources underwent both `` normal '' outburst and hard outbursts ( i.e. , with or without a transition to the soft states , respectively ; e.g. xte  j1550 - 564 , belloni et al .",
    "x - ray variability is a good indicator of the spectral state of a source : for instance uttley & mchardy ( 2001 ) discovered that black holes in the lhs feature a linear relation between the absolute rms amplitude of the variability and count rate .",
    "following the evolution of the count rate and the rms , muoz - darias et al .",
    "( 2011 ) developed a new tool to map the states of a bht in outburst : the rms - intensity diagram ( rid ) . in this diagram ,",
    "the linear relation between the absolute rms and the count rate is represented by the so - called hard line .",
    "muoz - darias et al . (",
    "2011 ) used the rid to study three outbursts of the bht gx 339 - 4 , showing that it is possible to associate different regions of the diagram to different states .",
    "c    swift j1753.5 - 0127 was discovered in the hard x - ray band with the burst alert telescope ( bat ) aboard swift on 2005 may 30 ( palmer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "after the discovery , the source flux reached a peak of 200 mcrab on 2005 july 9 , as observed by the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite ( see the light curve in figure [ fig : hid_licu ] ) .",
    "subsequently the flux started to decrease and then stalled at a level of @xmath420 mcrab ( 2 - 20 kev ) for more than @xmath4 6 months .",
    "this is an unusual behaviour for a transient , but even more unusual is the subsequent shallow flux rise which has been ongoing since roughly june 2006 , with a steepening on june 2008 ( krimm et al .",
    "figure [ fig : hid_licu ] shows that despite this re - brightening , the source never came back to the flux level observed in the first months of its outburst .",
    "the source has not returned to quiescence and at the moment of writing this paper it is still active ( e.g. soleri et al . 2012 ) . although the x - ray spectral hardness of swift j1753.5 - 0127 has not remained constant ( zhang et al .",
    "2007 , ramadevi & seetha 2007 , negoro et al . 2009 ) , no state transition to the intermediate states or to the hss was reported so far .",
    "the mass of the compact object in the binary has not been dynamically measured . however , the strongest hint that the system harbours a black hole comes from the hard power - law tail in the x/@xmath5-ray energy spectrum detected with integral up to @xmath4600 kev ( cadolle bel et al . 2007 ) , as no neutron - star low - mass x - ray binary has ever been detected above @xmath6 kev ( see e.g. falanga et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "c    swift j1753.5 - 0127 is certainly interesting for a number of reasons .",
    "for instance , the system follows the lower track in the x - ray / radio luminosity plane ( cadolle  bel et al .",
    "2007 ; soleri et al . 2010 ) , together with an increasing number of black holes ( coriat et al .",
    "2011 , see also corbel et al .",
    "2012 for the most recent version of the x - ray / radio luminosity plane ) .",
    "secondly , swift j1753.5 - 0127 would be the black hole with the second shortest orbital period , according to zurita et al .",

    "our conclusions are presented in ",
    "[ par : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we describe our analysis : data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) aboard rxte were used for producing the light curves , as well as for the variability studies ; for the spectral analysis we used data from both rxte and the swift satellite .",
    "we used 263 pca observations performed until 2010 - 10 - 05 ( obs .",
    "i d 95105 - 01 - 35 - 01 ) to produce the light curve and the hid in figure [ fig : hid_licu ] .",
    "the restriction to this interval is motivated by the fact that in october 2010 , after a soft excursion , the source is again steadily in the lhs , featuring similar properties to those displayed before the softening . for each observation",
    ", we used the standard rxte software ( within heasoft v. 6.11 ) to obtain the background and dead - time corrected count rate from the proportional counter unit 2 ( pcu2 ) in standard 2 ( std2 ) data mode ( jahoda et al .",
    "2006 ) , in the channel range 0 - 31 ( 2 - 15 kev ) .",
    "we defined the spectral hardness @xmath8 as the ratio of counts in the std2 channel bands 11 - 20 and 4 - 10 ( 6.1 - 10.2 kev and 3.3 - 6.1 kev , respectively ) . using the same method described in muoz - darias et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we produced the rid presented in the inset of figure [ fig : hid_licu ] and in figure [ fig : rid_zoom ] , calculating the fractional rms amplitude in the frequency band 0.1 - 64 hz , for the pca absolute channels 0 - 35 ( 2 - 15 kev ) .",
    "the absolute rms ( on the x axis of the rid ) was computed by multiplying the fractional rms by the net source count rate . using the same method",
    ", we also obtained the fractional rms using a soft and a hard band ( channels 0 - 13 and 14 - 35 ; this corresponds to 2 - 6 kev and 6 - 15 kev , respectively ) , as well as the rms spectrum for observation 91094 - 01 - 01 - 04 , which was produced by computing the fractional rms in 7 energy bins in the 2 - 20 kev energy band . for the rms spectrum ,",

    ", we will refer to the fractional rms amplitude as `` rms '' or `` fractional rms '' while we will explicitly use the adjective `` absolute '' when referring to the absolute rms . from the hid of swift j1753.5 - 0127 it is apparent that the spectral hardness did not remain constant during the whole outburst : the source softened between approximately 2009 july and 2010 may ( # 5 to # 7 in figure [ fig : hid_licu ] ) and then returned to its initial hardness level in 2010 july ( # 8 in figure [ fig : hid_licu ] ) . detailed timing and spectral analysis of this soft excursion",
    "is described in ",
    "[ par : timing_analysis ] and  [ par : spectral_analysis ] . despite the softening",
    ", swift j1753.5 - 0127 never went to the hss ( see  [ par : discussion ] ) : for this reason we will refer to this phase of the outburst as the `` failed transition '' .",
    "we produced power density spectra for 67 rxte observations performed between 2009 - 06 - 27 and 2010 - 07 - 28 ( obs .",
    "ids 93105 - 02 - 36 - 00 and 95105 - 01 - 25 - 01 , respectively ; see the black points in figure [ fig : hid_licu ] ) .",
    "the restriction to this interval is due to the fact that we want to study in detail the source behaviour during the `` failed transition '' , by means of timing and spectral analysis .",

    "if two contiguous observations were performed within 24 hours , we averaged their power spectra together .",
    "the resulting pds were normalized according to leahy et al .",
    "the fitting was carried out using the sum of lorentzian components ( normally one or two ) , as defined in belloni , psaltis & van der klis ( 2002a ) . throughout the paper",
    "we will quote the characteristic frequency @xmath9 at which the lorentzians attain their maximum in the @xmath10 representation , and the quality factor @xmath11 ( belloni et al .",

    "we produced energy spectra from the same rxte observations used for the timing analysis described in ",
    "[ par : timing_analysis ] .",
    "we applied standard filters and extracted pca spectra from std2 data ( pcu2 only , using all layers ) .",
    "the data were background and dead - time corrected .",
    "we generated response matrices and , following motta et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we fitted the spectra in the energy range 4 - 40 kev . in order to account for residual uncertainties in the instrument calibration we applied @xmath18 systematic error .",
    "the energy range was reduced to 4 - 25 kev when the pca spectra were fitted together with swift / xrt spectra .",
    "for the observations performed before december 2009 , we also extracted background and dead - time corrected spectra from the cluster b of the high energy timing experiment ( hexte aboard rxte ) and we fitted them in the 20 - 200 kev energy range , after generating response matrices . on december 2009",
    "hexte cluster b stopped rocking ( during normal operation , the two clusters rock on and off target to collect background data ) , hence we did not extract hexte spectra after that date .",
    "given the large poissonian uncertainties in the hexte spectra due to the low number of counts , no systematic error was added .",
    "c      we produced energy spectra from all the seven pointed swift observations performed during the softest phase of the outburst ( see table [ tab : log_fit_swift_spectra ] in the appendix ) .",
    "all the observations were performed quasi simultaneously to rxte ( within 36 hours ) .",
    "two swift observations ( obs .",
    "ids 00031232017 and 00031232018 ) were taken quasi simultaneously to the same rxte pointing ( obs . i d 95105 - 01 - 16 - 00 ) with a time delay of @xmath19 hours and less than @xmath20 hours , respectively .",
    "we therefore fitted simultaneously the rxte observation and the closest swift observation in time .",
    "we processed the xrt data using _ xrtpipeline _ with standard quality cuts .",

    "we applied a systematic error of @xmath23 ( campana et al .",
    "2008 ) and we grouped the spectra to a minimum of 20 counts per bin . the xrt spectra were fitted in the 0.8 - 8 kev energy range .",
    "c      we fitted the energy spectra using the standard xspec v11.3 fitting package ( arnaud 1996 ) . for simultaneous rxte and swift observations we combined the pca+xrt spectra to fit them together",
    "in order to account for flux cross - calibration uncertainties , we multiplied the continuum model by a constant .",
    "all model parameters , except these multiplicative constants , were linked between the different instruments .",
    "when fitting the rxte spectra alone , we fixed the interstellar absorption to the average column density value obtained by hiemstra et al .",
    "2009 ( @xmath24@xmath25 ) while we let it free to vary when including also swift / xrt data .",
    "the rxte spectra alone can be fitted using an absorbed broken ( elbow - shaped ) power law . however , when fitting rxte+swift spectra , a disc blackbody at low energies and a gaussian emission line were required in order to obtain a statistically acceptable fit .",

    "the source follows a hard line in the rid ( a linear relation between the absolute rms and the count rate , see the inset of figure [ fig : hid_licu ] ) , with fractional rms decreasing from @xmath28 to @xmath29% ( in correspondence of # 2 and # 3 in the hid in figure [ fig : hid_licu ] , respectively ) .",

    "the rid in figure [ fig : rid_zoom ] also shows that in the softest part of the `` failed transition '' the source does not follow the hard line .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hardness - rms_diag ] we plot the fractional rms amplitude in the soft and in the hard band ( red triangles and black circles , respectively ) versus the hardness . for clarity",
    ", we show the points from the `` failed transition '' in the bottom panel . during the first weeks of the outburst ( see the points at the lowest spectral hardness in the top panel of figure [ fig : hardness - rms_diag ] ) , the rms features an inverted spectrum .",
    "following gierliski & zdziarski ( 2005 ) , we define inverted , flat and hard rms spectra the spectra in which the fractional rms at low energies is higher , similar to or lower than the rms at high energies , respectively .",
    "an example of inverted rms spectrum from the initial phases of the outburst is shown in figure [ fig : rms_spec ] . given the lower number of counts , for the rest of the outburst we infer the shape of the rms spectrum from the values of the rms in the hard and in the soft bands in figure [ fig : hardness - rms_diag ] .",
    "after the first weeks , the rms spectrum is consistent with being flat , including the observations from the `` failed transition '' in the bottom panel .",
    "however , a hard rms spectrum can not be discarded for a handful of observations .",
    "c      figure [ fig : pds ] shows six power density spectra fitted with one or two lorentzians , representative of the source behaviour during the `` failed transition '' . following van straaten , van der klis & mndez ( 2003 ) , if the @xmath11-value of a lorentzian becomes negative in the fit , we fix it to zero .",
    "c    in figure [ fig : evoluz_qpo ] we plot the frequency of the lorentzians as a function of the hardness : two broad peaks can be identified in the pds ( with quality factor @xmath11 below @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ) , decreasing in frequency with the hardness .",
    "however , in the range @xmath35 , the frequency increases without being correlated with the hardness .",
    "most of the power spectra obtained from the observations in this hardness range are fitted with lorentzians in which we fixed the value of @xmath11 to zero .",
    "although the first peak , represented by black circles , is present in the whole hardness range , the second peak ( downward red triangles ) disappears at @xmath36 .",
    "pds iv in figure [ fig : pds ] represents an example of a power spectrum from an observation characterized by low @xmath8 and fitted with one lorentzian .",
    "we found no significant correlation between the values of the fractional rms ( that is proportional to the area of the symbol ) and the hardness for either of the two lorentzians .",
    "figure [ fig : wk ] shows the frequency of the low - frequency qpo ( @xmath37 ) or of the hump ( @xmath38 ) for a number of black holes and neutron stars in the hard state ( commonly called wk correlation ; wijnands & van der klis 1999 ) as a function of the break frequency @xmath39 ( black circles ) .",
    "we adapted the plot from figure 11 of belloni et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , including only those observations in which either @xmath40 or @xmath41 is present , which is the most relevant case to our analysis .",
    "the hump ( @xmath41 ) usually appears at frequencies similar to the lfqpo ( @xmath40 ) but it is characterized by a lower quality factor ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the plot also includes the data points for swift j1753.5 - 0127 ( red stars ) , obtained using the frequencies of the two peaks described above .",
    "as one can see , the path of swift j1753.5 - 0127 in the diagram overlaps to the one of the other systems , despite its ( possibly ) shallower slope and two points which fall above the wk correlation .",
    "the higher frequency peak that we fit in the pds of swift j1753.5 - 0127 ( red downward triangles in figure [ fig : evoluz_qpo ] ) is broad ( with @xmath42 , except for two cases , see table [ tab : log_pds_fit ] ) , and so we can not identify it as the lfqpo commonly detected in the hard states . following belloni et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , we will refer to the lower and the higher frequency broad peaks in the power spectra of swift j1753.5 - 0127 as @xmath43 ( break ) and @xmath41 ( hump ) , respectively .",

    "as expected , the observations in the softest part of the hid ( the red stars in figure [ fig : rid_zoom ] ) correspond to the highest values of the photon index @xmath44 ( grey shaded areas in figure [ fig : param_energy_spectra ] ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : gamma2_vs_gamma1 ] we can see that @xmath45 and @xmath44 could be correlated ( despite a large scatter ) : a spearman rank correlation coefficient indicates that a weak correlation probably exists , with correlation coefficient @xmath46 and a low probability for the null hypothesis ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the slope of the correlation becomes shallower at @xmath48 . in this diagram ,",
    "the area of the points is proportional to the value of @xmath49 , suggesting that the largest values of @xmath49 are associated with the lowest @xmath45 .    in our spectral fits we used a _",
    "component six times ( in five spectra from pca+xrt data and in one spectrum from pca data ) with temperature in the range @xmath50 kev .",
    "this is slightly lower than the values usually observed in other bhts in these states ( see e.g. belloni et al .",
    "although an f - test suggests that in all these spectra the disc component significantly improves the fit , in four spectra the disc normalization can not be measured accurately ( the ratio between the disc normalization and its negative error at 1 @xmath51 is smaller than 3 ) . in order to understand whether the thermal component is really needed , we calculated the disc fluxes ( or the 95% upper limits for the spectra in which the disc normalization is not well constrained ) , showing that all the values are consistent within the errors .",
    "this suggests that , although our ability of constraining the parameters of the _ diskbb _ varied , the disc itself did not vary much between these observations .",
    "despite several years of observations at different wavelengths , it is difficult to explain the evolution of the particularly long outburst of swift j1753.5 - 0127 ( still ongoing at the moment of writing this manuscript ) in the same framework as the majority of the bhts .",
    "our observing campaign with rxte and swift provided important information about its evolution , showing that the source did not go to the soft states and allowing us to make comparisons with other ( classes of ) sources .",
    "as expected for a bht in the lhs , swift j1753.5 - 0127 draws a hard line in the rid and it features , at the beginning of the outburst ( when @xmath52 and the count rate is above @xmath53 c / s / pcu2 ) , its highest fractional rms ( between @xmath54 and @xmath28 ) . unlike the majority of the bhts in the lhs ( belloni et al . 2011 ) , the fractional rms anticorrelates with the spectral hardness @xmath8 and correlates with the count rate ( see figure [ fig : hid_licu ] ) .",
    "this shows that , at least in this case , the value of @xmath8 and the position in the hid was not an indication of an approaching spectral transition to the intermediate states . in gx 339 - 4 , muoz - darias et al .",
    "( 2011 ) associated the transition from the lhs to the hims with a clear variation in the x - ray rid , namely the source leaves the hard line and moves to the left - hand side of the diagram along another track .",
    "interestingly , this change in the rid is related to a sudden change in the x - ray / infrared correlation : in the 2002 outburst of gx 339 - 4 , the infrared flux ( in the h band ) dropped by a factor @xmath55 in about 10 days while in the same time interval the x - ray flux only decreased by a factor @xmath56 ( homan et al .",
    "figure [ fig : rid_zoom ] shows that the observations of swift j1753.5 - 0127 with the lowest spectral hardness are also characterized by the lowest fractional rms and they all lie on the left - hand side of the hard line . unlike gx 339 - 4 , these observations do not follow a precise path in the rid but we observe several hardenings and softenings .",
    "nevertheless , we identify the observations with the lowest hardness and the lowest fractional rms as hims observations .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that in swift j1753.5 - 0127 , differently from gx 339 - 4 , it is not possible to mark the exact moment of the transition from the lhs to the hims , since we neither see a clear turn in the rid nor we have simultaneous observations at longer wavelengths",

    "an example of another source which does not feature the type - c qpo in the pds is the black hole cyg x-1 ( pottschmidt et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and ramadevi & seetha ( 2007 ) detected a lfqpo in the power spectra of swift j1753.5 - 0127 from the first months of the outburst .",
    "the properties of this lfqpo are consistent with a type c , although both zhang et al . ( 2007 ) and ramadevi & seetha ( 2007 ) do not use this nomenclature to classify the qpo . during the initial weeks of the outburst the rms spectrum",
    "is inverted , without any indication of flattening at low energies ( see the rms spectrum in figure [ fig : rms_spec ] ) .",
    "although the majority of the bhts in the lhs features flat spectra , inverted spectra have already been observed ( e.g. in xte j1650 - 500 , see figure 5 in gierliski & zdziarski 2005 ) .",
    "zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and gierliski & zdziarski ( 2005 ) explained this type of spectrum by considering a seed photon input to the comptonizing corona with variable energy , that causes a pivoting of the energy spectrum around @xmath85 kev and a decline in fractional rms above @xmath86 kev . in xte j1650 - 500 ,",
    "the absence of a flattening suggests that the disc from which the seed photons originates is very cold ( a disc with @xmath87 kev would give a flattening in the rms spectrum below @xmath34 kev , gierliski & zdziarski 2005 ) . in  [ par : result_energy ] we showed that an absorbed broken power law is sufficient to fit all the spectra from the observations in the `` failed transition '' , except for the softest observations where a cold disc is needed to fit the spectrum .",
    "chiang et al . ( 2010 ) analysed swift and rxte observations of swift j1753.5 - 0127 performed when the source was in the lhs , between july 2005 and july 2007 .",
    "they found that a thermal component is needed to fit the energy spectra , with temperature below @xmath88 kev .",
    "these results confirm that the disc is indeed too cold to produce a flat rms spectrum at low energies .",
    "after the first weeks the rms spectrum changes and becomes , for the rest of the outburst , consistent with being either flat or slightly inverted .",
    "flat rms spectra can be easily explained by assuming that the entire energy spectrum ( dominated by a comptonizing component ) varies in normalization ( luminosity ) but not in spectral shape ( except possibly the high energy cut - off ; gierliski & zdziarski 2005 ) .",
    "c      although our results are consistent with swift j1753.5 - 0127 being a bht in the hard states , the nature of the compact object ( black hole or neutron star ) still needs to be proved . the weak correlation between the photon indices of the broken power law used to fit the energy spectra",
    "( see figure [ fig : gamma2_vs_gamma1 ] ) suggests that the spectral shape of the source evolves smoothly with the hardness between the lhs and the hims .",
    "interestingly , a similar correlation ( with higher spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath89 ) has already been reported by wilms et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in the dynamically confirmed black hole cyg x-1 ( herrero et al .",
    "1995 ) . similarly to swift j1753.5 - 0127 in",
    "the `` failed transition '' , cyg x-1 goes through frequent spectral hardenings and softenings . moreover , both cyg x-1 and swift j1753.5 - 0127 ( only in the `` failed transition '' ) lack the type - c qpo , which is usually observed in the pds of many black holes in the hard states .",
    "this similarities between the two systems do not constitute a proof that swift j1753.5 - 0127 contains a black hole , nevertheless they can be considered another hint in this direction .",
    "sunyaev & revnivtsev ( 2000 ) analysed a sample of 9 black holes and 9 neutron stars in the hard state and noted that the black holes show a steeper decline in the power spectra at frequencies higher than 10 - 50 hz than the neutron stars . here",
    "we compare one power spectrum of swift j1753.5 - 0127 in the lhs with power spectra from a dynamically confirmed bht ( xte j1550 - 564 ; see e.g. orosz et al .",
    "2011 ) and two secure neutron star atoll sources ( 4u 1705 - 44 and 4u 1608 - 52 ) in the hard ( extreme island ) state ( see van der klis 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the purpose of our exercise is to obtain more information about the compact object in swift j1753.5 - 0127 and not to perform a systematic study of the differences between the power spectra of black holes and neutron stars . in order to have a criterion to compare pds from different sources , we only considered power spectra with similar break frequency @xmath39 .",
    "for each power spectrum , we calculated the fractional rms in the frequency intervals @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the details of this analysis , as well as the power spectra , are reported in table [ tab : log_comparison ] and in figure [ fig : comparison_pds ] , respectively .",
    "c    in our sample , neutron stars have a smaller drop ( the ratio between the fractional rms in the frequency intervals @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) in rms at high frequencies than black holes : a drop by a factor of @xmath90 in neutron stars and by a factor @xmath91 in the bht xte j1550 - 564 , whereas swift j1753.5 - 0127 shows a @xmath92 factor drop . the difference is already evident inspecting figure [ fig : comparison_pds ] , in which the power spectra are overplotted to the best fitting function to the spectrum of swift j1753.5 - 0127 .",
    "this result is a further hint that swift j1753.5 - 0127 hosts a black hole .      an interesting aspect of the outburst of swift j1753.5 - 0127 concerns the morphology of the x - ray light curve , namely the long period at low and slowly increasing flux that took place after the end of the initial flare and lasted more than two years .",
    "although such light curves are uncommon , a similar behaviour has already been observed in other x - ray binaries , for instance in the neutron star 4u 1608 - 52 .",
    "this source usually undergoes regular outbursts , spaced out by periods of quiescence in which the pca count rate is consistent with zero .",
    "figure [ fig:4u1608 ] shows the pca light curve and hardness curve of 4u 1608 - 52 for a period of @xmath93 days from 2007 may 12 , where we observe two outbursts . in between the two outbursts and after the second one , the system goes into prolonged low - flux phases ( with count rate below @xmath94 c / s / pcu2 ) in which it features several mini - outbursts , characterized by short duration ( tens of days ) and a high hardness level ( above @xmath95 ) .",
    "the light curves of swift j1753.5 - 0127 and 4u 1608 - 52 ( focussing on figure [ fig:4u1608 ] ) presents some similarities : both sources had an initial flare ( swift j1753.5 - 0127 in 2005 ; 4u 1608 - 52 between days @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the light curve in figure [ fig:4u1608 ] ) that was not followed by a return to quiescence . in both cases , the systems neither went back to the flux levels observed at the peak of the initial flares nor had a transition to the soft states .",
    "it is interesting to note that the light curves of swift j1753.5 - 0127 and 4u 1608 - 52 are reminiscent of those observed in a class of cataclysmic variables , the so - called z camelopardalis ( z cam ) .",
    "z cam undergo regular outbursts like other subgroups of dwarf novae , followed by periods ( weeks to months long ) of standstills , in which their optical luminosity remains constant at a level close to , but slightly below , the peak of the outburst ( see king & cannizzo 1998 for more details ) .",
    "haswell & king ( 2001 ) suggested that neutron star x - ray binaries with short orbital period ( @xmath98 hours , as the majority of the cataclysmic variables ) could also feature standstills , given their high mass transfer . considering the short orbital period of swift j1753.5 - 0127 ( @xmath99 hours ; zurita et al .",
    "2008 ) , it is possible that the equivalent of a standstill followed its 2005 flare . although the orbital period of 4u 1608 - 52 is longer ( @xmath100 hours ; wachter et al . 2002 ) , its prolonged low - flux phase might be also interpreted as a standstill , possibly favoured by the irradiation from the neutron star .",
    "we observed the black - hole candidate swift j1753.5 - 0127 with rxte for more than five years .",
    "we studied the general evolution of the outburst ( still ongoing at the moment of writing this manuscript ) making use of the x - ray light curve , rms - intensity diagram and the hardness - intensity diagram .",
    "the source spent most of the time in the hard state and , more than 4 years after the beginning of its outburst , moved to the hard - intermediate state .",
    "we followed the state transition using power density and energy spectra ( from rxte and the swift satellite ) and showed that the system returned to the hard state after a few months , without passing through the soft states .    during this `` failed transition '' swift j1753.5 - 0127 features properties which are reminiscent of those observed in the dynamically confirmed black hole cyg x-1 .",
    "first of all , both sources show frequent softening and hardening on timescales of days , without leaving the hard states .",
    "interestingly , the type - c qpo is not detected in swift j1753.5 - 0127 during the `` failed transition '' , although it is usually considered a signature of black holes in the hard states . finally , in the energy spectra of swift j1753.5 - 0127 we observe a ( weak ) correlation between the photon indices of the broken power law similar to that previously reported for cyg x-1 .    looking for further clues about the nature of the accretor in swift j1753.5 - 0127 ( black hole of neutron star ) , we showed that in one power spectrum the drop in rms at high frequencies ( above 100 times the break frequency ) is higher than in two neutron star systems and similar to the dynamically confirmed black hole xte j1550 - 564 , indeed suggesting that swift j1753.5 - 0127 hosts a black hole .",
    "we also studied the peculiar evolution of the outburst , focussing on the prolonged period at low flux that followed the initial flare .",
    "although such phases are rare in low - mass x - ray binaries , they are not unobserved , as for instance in the neutron star 4u 1608 - 52 .",
    "we suggest that these low - flux intervals are equivalent to the standstills observed in some cataclysmic variables , namely in the z camelopardalis .",
    "this can be possibly explained considering the short orbital period of swift j1753.5 - 0127 ( @xmath99 hours ) , close to the typical orbital periods of cataclysmic variables .",
