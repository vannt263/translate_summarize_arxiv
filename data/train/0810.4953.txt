    "the theory of fault - tolerant quantum computation shows that properly encoded quantum information can be protected against decoherence and processed reliably with imperfect hardware @xcite .",
    "demonstrating that this theory really works in practice is one of the great challenges facing contemporary science .",
    "a large - scale fault - tolerant quantum computer would be a scientific milestone , and it should also be _ useful _ , capable of solving hard problems that are beyond the reach of ordinary digital computers .    though the theory of quantum fault tolerance strengthens our confidence that truly scalable quantum computers can be realized in the next few decades , failure is certainly possible .",
    "perhaps the engineering challenges will prove to be so daunting , and the resources needed to overcome them so demanding , that society will be unable or unwilling to bear the cost for the foreseeable future .",
    "perhaps new fundamental principles of physics , as yet undiscovered , will prevent large - scale quantum computers from behaving as currently accepted theory dictates .",
    "finding that quantum computers fail for a fundamental reason would be a significant scientific advance , but would disappoint prospective users .",
    "there is a third reason to worry about the future prospects for fault - tolerant quantum computing .",
    "mathematical results establishing that fault tolerance works effectively are premised on assumptions about the properties of the noise .",
    "the most obvious requirement is that the noise must be sufficiently weak  if the noise strength is below a _ threshold of accuracy _ then quantum computing is scalable in principle .",
    "but in addition , the noise must be suitably local , both spatially and temporally .",
    "perhaps the quest for a quantum computer will be frustrated because the noise afflicting actual hardware is just not amenable to fault - tolerant protocols .",
    "we can anticipate therefore that progress toward scalable quantum computing will require an ongoing dialog between experimenters who will better understand the limitations of their devices and theorists who will propose better ways to overcome the limitations and to evaluate the efficacy of these proposals . in the meantime , an important task for theorists is to broaden the range of noise models for which useful accuracy threshold theorems can be proven , and we pursue that task in this paper . our main result is a new proof of the threshold theorem for non - markovian gaussian noise models , in which system qubits are locally coupled to bath variables that have gaussian fluctuations . specifically ,",
    "if the bath is a system of uncoupled harmonic oscillators , at either zero or nonzero temperature , our theorem expresses the threshold condition in terms of the power spectrum of the bath fluctuations .",
    "early proofs of the threshold theorem @xcite assumed that the noise is _ markovian_. this means that each quantum gate in the noisy circuit can be modeled as a unitary transformation that acts jointly on a set of the qubits in the computer ( the system qubits ) and on the environment ( the bath variables ) , but where it is assumed that the bath has no memory  the state of the bath is refreshed after every gate .",
    "the theorem was extended to a class of non - markovian noise models in @xcite , and further generalized in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite have the substantial virtue that the state of the bath and its internal dynamics can be arbitrary ; for fault - tolerant quantum computing to work , it is only required that the bath couple weakly and locally to the system .",
    "however these results also have two serious drawbacks .",
    "first , the threshold condition is not easily related to experimentally accessible quantities ; rather it requires terms in the hamiltonian that couple the system to the bath to have a sufficiently small operator norm .",
    "second , this condition severely constrains the very - high - frequency fluctuations of the bath .",
    "intuitively , it seems that this constraint , which may limit the applicability of the threshold theorem to noise in some realistic settings , ought not to be necessary , since fluctuations with a time scale much shorter than the time it takes to execute a quantum gate tend to average out .",
    "one possible way to reach more pleasing conclusions is to make physically reasonable assumptions about the noise that go beyond the assumptions of @xcite ; that is the approach we follow here .",
    "our new threshold theorem applies to any noise model in which the bath variables are free fields ( aside from their coupling to the system qubits ) , and expresses the threshold condition in terms of the bath s two - point correlation function , which is in principle measurable .",
    "it should be possible to extend our analysis to the case where the bath variables have sufficiently weak self - interactions , though we will not pursue that extension here .",
    "furthermore , though our new threshold condition still requires the very - high - frequency bath fluctuations to be sufficiently weak , this requirement is considerably relaxed compared to previous threshold theorems that apply to non - markovian noise . showing that these requirements can be relaxed even further , perhaps by making additional physically motivated assumptions , is an important open problem .",
    "experimenters use a variety of techniques to suppress the noise in quantum hardware , such as cleverly designed pulse sequences to improve the fidelity of quantum gates ( spin echos , dynamical decoupling , etc . ) and intrinsically robust encodings of quantum information ( noiseless subsystems , topologically protected qubits , etc . ) .",
    "these techniques can be highly effective and are likely to be incorporated into the design of future quantum computers , but do not by themselves suffice to ensure the scalability of quantum computing .",
    "after such tricks are exhausted some residual noise inevitably remains that must be controlled using quantum error - correcting codes and fault - tolerant methods .",
    "since our objective in this paper is to study the effectiveness of these fault - tolerant methods , our noise models may be viewed as effective descriptions of this residual noise in `` fundamental '' quantum gates that might already be realized using complex and sophisticated protocols .    after reviewing previously known formulations of the quantum accuracy threshold theorem in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] ( with some details relegated to appendix a ) , we state our new result in sec .  [",
    "sec : gaussian ] , explore some of its implications in sec .",
    "[ sec : implications ] , derive it in sec .",
    "[ sec : derivation ] , and discuss some generalizations in sec .",

    "[ sec : diagonal ] .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "here we will briefly review some previously know formulations of the quantum accuracy threshold theorem , and explain why these results still leave something to be desired . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaussian ] we will state our new result , which addresses some of the shortcomings of the previous results .    the goal of fault - tolerant quantum computing is to simulate an ideal quantum circuit using the noisy gates that can be executed by actual devices .",
    "theoretical results show that this goal is attainable if the noise is not too strong and not too strongly correlated .",
    "the essential trick that makes fault tolerance work is that the logical quantum state processed by the computer can be encoded very nonlocally , so that it is well protected from damage caused by local noise .",
    "it is convenient to analyze the effectiveness of a fault - tolerant noisy circuit by invoking a _ fault - path expansion _ ; schematically , @xmath0 let us use the term _ location _ to speak of an operation in a quantum circuit that is performed in a single time step ; a location may be a single - qubit or multi - qubit gate , a qubit preparation step , a qubit measurement , or the identity operation in the case of a qubit that is idle during the time step . in each fault path , the quantum gates are faulty at a specified set of locations in the circuit , while at all other locations the quantum gates are assumed to be ideal .",
    "we say that the faulty locations are `` bad '' and that the ideal locations are `` good . ''",
    "the general concept of a fault - path expansion applies quite broadly , and different noise models can be distinguished according to how we flesh out the meaning of eq .",
    "( [ fault - path - expansion ] ) .      in a `` stochastic '' noise model",
    "we assign a _ probability _ to each fault path @xcite .",
    "we speak of _ local stochastic noise _ with strength @xmath1 if , for any specified set @xmath2 of @xmath3 locations in the circuit , the sum @xmath4 of the probabilities of all fault paths that are bad at _ all _ of these @xmath3 locations satisfies @xmath5 in this noise model , no further restrictions are imposed on the noise , and in particular the trace - preserving quantum operation applied at the faulty locations may be chosen for each fault path by an adversary who wants the computation to fail . thus the faults can be correlated , both spatially and temporally , but the adversary s power is limited because an attack on @xmath3 specified circuit locations occurs with probability at most @xmath6 . the noise is `` local '' in the sense that attacking each additional location suppresses the probability of the fault path by another power of @xmath1 .",
    "most proofs of the threshold theorem use _ recursive simulations_. this means that quantum information is protected by a hierarchy of codes within codes , and that the fault - tolerant circuit has a self - similar structure .",
    "we refer to an unencoded quantum circuit as a `` level-0 '' simulation . in a level-1 simulation ,",
    "each elementary gate in the level-0 circuit is replaced by a level-1 _ gadget _ constructed from elementary gates ; this 1-gadget performs the appropriate encoded operation on logical qubits that are protected by a quantum error - correcting code @xmath7 . in a level-2 simulation , each elementary gate in the ideal circuit is replaced by a level-2 gadget ; the 2-gadget is constructed by replacing each elementary gate in the 1-gadget by a 1-gadget .",
    "a 2-gadget operates on quantum information protected by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes code concatenation .",
    "( that is , @xmath10 is encoded by first encoding the `` outer '' code @xmath11 , and then encoding each qubit in the @xmath11 block using the `` inner '' code @xmath12 . ) in a level-@xmath13 simulation , each elementary gate in the ideal circuit is replaced by a level-@xmath13 gadget , constructed by replacing each elementary gate in the @xmath14-gadget by a 1-gadget ; it operates on quantum information protected by @xmath15 .    for local stochastic noise , and also for other noise models with suitable properties ,",
    "a recursive simulation can be analyzed by a procedure called _ level reduction _ , in which a level-@xmath13 simulation is mapped to a `` coarse - grained '' level-@xmath14 simulation that acts on the top - level logical information in exactly the same way .",
    "suppose for example that @xmath7 is a distance-3 code that can correct one error .",
    "then if the 1-gadgets are properly designed , each `` good '' 1-gadget that contains no more than one faulty location simulates the corresponding ideal gate correctly , while `` bad '' 1-gadgets with more than one fault may simulate the ideal gate incorrectly . in the level reduction step , for each fault path the good 1-gadgets are mapped to ideal level-0 gates , while the bad 1-gadgets are mapped to faulty level-0 gates .",
    "after this step , the resulting noisy circuit is still subject to local stochastic noise , but with a renormalized value of the noise strength @xmath16 the renormalized value of the noise strength is @xmath17 , because at least two faults are required for a 1-gadget to fail ; the quantity @xmath18 is a combinatoric factor counting the number of `` malignant '' sets of locations within the 1-gadget where faults can cause failure .    since level reduction maps local stochastic noise to local stochastic noise ( but with a revised value of the noise strength ) , the level reduction step can be carried out repeatedly , and analyzed by the same method each time . that the structure of the noise is preserved , even though its strength is renormalized ,",
    "is a useful feature of the local stochastic noise model not shared by some noise models .",
    "for example , if faults in level-0 gates were independently and identically distributed , the effective noise model after one level reduction step would become correlated rather than independent . see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the level reduction procedure .    by repeating the level reduction",
    "step all together @xmath13 times , we reduce the level-@xmath13 simulation to an effective level-0 ( _ i.e. _ , unencoded ) simulation with noise strength @xmath19 it follows that for @xmath20 ( the _ accuracy threshold _ ) , the effective noise strength becomes negligibly small for @xmath13 sufficiently large , and the simulation becomes highly reliable .",
    "more precisely , for any fixed @xmath20 and fixed @xmath21 , an ideal circuit with @xmath22 gates can be simulated with error probability @xmath23 by a noisy circuit with @xmath24 gates , where for some constant @xmath25 @xmath26 ( the constant @xmath25 is determined by the size of the 1-gadgets . ) thus , with reasonable overhead cost , the noisy simulation gets the right answer with high probability .",
    "this is the quantum accuracy threshold theorem for local stochastic noise .",
    "for the threshold theorem to apply , two features of the simulation are essential : first , we must assume that quantum gates can be executed in parallel  otherwise we would be unable to control storage errors that occur simultaneously in different parts of the computer .",
    "second , we assume that qubits can be `` discarded '' and replaced by fresh qubits ( for example , by measuring the qubits and resetting them )  otherwise we would be unable to flush from the computer the entropy introduced by noise .",
    "estimates of the accuracy threshold @xmath27 often rely on further assumptions .",
    "for example , if we assume that qubit measurements are as fast as quantum gates , that classical computations are arbitrarily accurate , that the accuracy of a two - qubit quantum gate does not depend on the spatial separation of the qubits , and that no data qubits `` leak '' from the computational hilbert space , then it has been shown that @xmath28 @xcite . for noise models with weaker correlations than in the local stochastic noise model ,",
    "the proven accuracy threshold is above @xmath29 @xcite , and numerical evidence suggests that the actual value of the threshold can be of order @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the threshold is not drastically reduced if some of these assumptions are relaxed , for example by allowing measurements to be slow @xcite , allowing leakage @xcite , or requiring quantum gates to be local on a two - dimensional array @xcite .",
    "the local stochastic noise model is handy for analysis and has some quasi - realistic features , but it is still rather artificial . from a physics perspective , it is more natural to formulate the noise model in terms of a hamiltonian @xmath31 that governs the joint evolution of the system and the bath",
    ". we may express @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the time - dependent system hamiltonian that realizes the ideal quantum circuit , @xmath34 is the ( arbitrary ) hamiltonian of the bath , and @xmath35 is a perturbation , responsible for the noise , that may couple the system to the bath .",
    "we say that such a noise model is _ non - markovian _ , meaning that quantum information can escape from the system to the bath and then return to the system at a later time , so that the state of the system at time @xmath36 is not uniquely determined by its state at time @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath35 may also contain terms that act nontrivially only on the system , representing unitary noise arising from imperfect control of the system hamiltonian .",
    "actually , the local stochastic noise model already incorporates some non - markovian effects ; even when fault paths are weighted by probabilities , the adversary who attacks the circuit might employ a quantum memory .",
    "but different methods are needed to analyze the consequences of hamiltonian noise models , because fault paths are summed coherently rather than stochastically .",
    "the locations in a quantum circuit include not only quantum gates and storage steps , but also qubit preparation and measurement steps . preparation and measurement noise can be incorporated into a hamiltonian description by various means . in this paper",
    "we will take an especially simple approach , modeling an imperfect preparation by an ideal preparation followed by evolution governed by @xmath31 , and modeling an imperfect measurement by an ideal measurement preceded by evolution governed by @xmath31 . for the time being , to simplify the discussion , we will imagine that system qubits are prepared only at the very beginning of the computation and measured only at the very end .",
    "preparations and measurements that occur at intermediate times can easily be incorporated ; we will elaborate on this point in sec .",
    "[ sec : generalizations ] . for the continuous - time hamiltonian dynamics we are now considering",
    ", a `` location '' consists of a specified qubit or set of qubits to which a gate is applied , and a specified _ time interval _ during which that gate is realized by the ideal system hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "we may say that the hamiltonian noise model is `` local '' if the perturbation @xmath35 can be expressed as a sum of terms @xmath38 where each @xmath39 acts on only a small number of system qubits ( while perhaps also acting collectively on many bath variables ) .",
    "the joint unitary time evolution operator @xmath40 for system and bath , resulting from integrating the schrdinger equation for hamiltonian @xmath31 , can be formally expanded to all orders in time - dependent perturbation theory in @xmath35 . in any fixed term in this expansion ,",
    "perturbations chosen from the set @xmath41 are inserted at specified times .",
    "for such a fixed term in the perturbation expansion , let us say that a location in the ( level-0 ) noisy simulation is `` bad '' if an inserted perturbation acts nontrivially somewhere inside that location ; otherwise that location is `` good . ''",
    "of course , under this definition a single insertion of @xmath39 might cause two ( or perhaps more ) locations to be bad in a particular time step , if @xmath39 acts collectively on two qubits that are undergoing different gates executed in parallel in the ideal circuit .",
    "as already noted , we may assume that the system qubits have been initialized ideally at the start of the hamiltonian evolution ; we denote this initial system state by @xmath42 .",
    "we also assume that the initial state of the bath is a pure state @xmath43 .",
    "there is really no loss of generality in supposing that the bath starts out in a pure state ; if we wish to consider a mixed initial state of the bath instead ( for example , a thermal state ) , we may include in the bath a `` reference '' system that `` purifies '' the mixed state .",
    "we have also noted that we may assume that final measurements performed on system qubits are ideal .",
    "just before these final measurements are conducted , the ( pure ) state of the system and bath is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the initial state of system and bath . for any specified set @xmath2 of @xmath3 locations in the circuit , let us denote by @xmath46 the sum of all the terms in the formal perturbation expansion of @xmath47 such that all of these @xmath3 locations are bad .",
    "then we speak of _ local non - markovian noise _ ( or more briefly _ local noise _ ) with strength @xmath1 if @xmath48 the noise strength @xmath1 can be related to properties of the perturbation @xmath35",
    ". we will sometimes refer to this model as local _",
    "coherent _ noise , to emphasize that ( in contrast to the local _ stochastic _ noise model ) fault paths are assigned amplitudes rather than probabilities .",
    "although there are some new subtleties ( see @xcite and appendix  [ sec : appendix ] ) , the level - reduction concept can be applied to hamiltonian noise models in much the same way as for stochastic models .",
    "we may say that a 1-gadget is bad if it contains bad level-0 gates at a malignant set of locations , that a 2-gadget is bad if it contains bad 1-gadgets at a malignant set of locations , that a 3-gadget is bad if it contains bad 2-gadgets at a malignant set of locations , and so on .",
    "for any specified set @xmath49 of @xmath3 @xmath13-gadgets in the circuit , let us denote by @xmath50 the sum of all the terms in the formal perturbation expansion of @xmath47 such that all of these @xmath3 @xmath13-gadgets are bad .",

    "( [ local - noise - strength - levelk ] ) is sketched in appendix a. furthermore , a level-@xmath13 simulation in which all @xmath13-gadgets are good simulates the ideal circuit perfectly . in this sense",
    ", repeated level reduction reduces a level-@xmath13 simulation to an equivalent level-0 simulation while mapping local noise to local noise with a renormalized noise strength @xmath52 , and for @xmath20 , the renormalized noise strength becomes negligible for large @xmath13 .",
    "the threshold value @xmath27 of the noise strength for local noise is of the same order ( though not exactly the same ) as the threshold for local stochastic noise .",
    "we emphasize that , once eq .",
    "( [ local - noise - strength ] ) is established , we can derive eq .",
    "( [ local - noise - strength - levelk ] ) without any further assumptions about the hamiltonian @xmath53 .",
    "the strength @xmath1 of local noise can be estimated based on the detailed properties of the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ expansion - system - bath - hamiltonian ] ) of the perturbation @xmath35 in terms of local system operators .",
    "for example , in @xcite the noise was assumed to be `` short range '' in the sense that the perturbation @xmath35 acts collectively on a pair of data qubits only while the ideal system hamiltonian @xmath33 also couples those two data qubits  that is , only while the ideal quantum circuit calls for that pair of qubits to undergo a two - qubit gate .",
    "for this short - range local noise model , it was shown that eq .",
    "( [ local - noise - strength ] ) is satisfied if we choose @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the time needed to execute a quantum gate , @xmath56 denotes the sup operator norm , and the maximum is over all circuit locations and all times . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "the noise was assumed to be `` long range '' with @xmath35 coupling each pair of data qubits irrespective of the structure of the ideal circuit . in that case",
    "we may write @xmath57 where the sum is over all unordered pairs of system qubits ; @xmath58 acts collectively on the pair of qubits @xmath59 and also on the bath .",
    "for this long - range local noise model , it was shown that eq .",
    "( [ local - noise - strength ] ) is satisfied if we choose @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the numerical constant @xmath62 .",
    "( this is actually a slight improvement over the value of @xmath63 reported in @xcite ; the improved value can be derived using the reasoning described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : many - marked ] below , if we assume @xmath64 . )    the origin of eq .",
    "( [ short - range ] ) is easy to understand intuitively @xcite .",
    "if each one of the @xmath3 specified locations in @xmath2 is bad , then the perturbation must be inserted at least once in each of these locations , and each insertion reduces the norm of the state by a factor of at least @xmath65 . inside each location , there is an _",
    "earliest _ insertion of the perturbation that can occur at any time during the duration of the location , a time window of width @xmath55 . integrating over the time of the earliest insertion of the perturbation inside each location",
    ", we obtain eq .",
    "( [ short - range ] ) . for the long - range noise model , a single insertion of the perturbation @xmath58 can cause two circuit locations to be bad if qubits @xmath66 and @xmath67 are participating in separate gates , and therefore the noise strength is correspondingly higher ( observe that @xmath68 rather than @xmath1 appears on the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ long - range ] ) ) .      the results eq .",
    "( [ short - range ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ long - range ] ) are significant , because they demonstrate that quantum computing is scalable in principle for non - markovian noise described by a system - bath hamiltonian . furthermore , this formulation of the threshold theorem has the noteworthy advantage that the argument works for any bath hamiltonian @xmath34 .",
    "the dynamics of the bath does not matter , as long as the perturbation @xmath35 is `` local '' and sufficiently weak .    however , expressing the threshold condition as in eq .",
    "( [ short - range ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ long - range ] ) has serious drawbacks .",
    "first we should note that while in the local stochastic noise model we may interpret the noise strength @xmath1 as an error _ probability _ per gate , in the non - markovian noise model @xmath1 is really an error _",
    "amplitude_. since a probability is a square of an amplitude , requiring @xmath20 in the local noise model is a far more stringent criterion than requiring @xmath20 in the local stochastic noise model .",
    "our analysis yields a much weaker lower bound on the accuracy threshold for the local noise model than for the local stochastic noise model because we pessimistically allow the bad fault paths to add together with a common phase and thus to interfere constructively .",
    "most likely this analysis is far too pessimistic ; it is reasonable to expect that distinct fault paths have only weakly correlated phases , and if so , then the modulus of a sum of @xmath69 fault paths should grow like @xmath70 rather than linearly in @xmath69 .",
    "that is , if the phases of fault paths can be regarded as random , then we expect the _ probabilities _ of the fault paths , rather than their amplitudes , to accumulate linearly .",
    "an important open problem for the theory of quantum fault tolerance is to put this phase - randomization hypothesis on a rigorous footing , and thereby to establish a much higher estimate of the accuracy threshold for local noise .",
    "but we will not be addressing this problem in this paper .",
    "there are other drawbacks of the threshold condition eq .",
    "( [ short - range ] ) that we _ will _ try to address , however .",
    "one issue is that the norm of the system - bath hamiltonian is not directly measurable in experiments , and it would be far preferable to state the threshold condition in terms of experimentally accessible quantities , such as the noise power spectrum .",
    "in fact , for otherwise reasonable noise models , the norm @xmath71 could be formally infinite ( if for example the system qubits couple to unbounded bath operators such as the quadrature amplitudes of bath oscillators ) , and in such cases the threshold theorem has little force .    in more physical terms , an undesirable feature of demanding small @xmath1 where @xmath1 is given by eq .",
    "( [ short - range ] ) is that this condition requires that the very - high - frequency component of the noise be particularly weak , a requirement that seems not to be physically well motivated . to be concrete ,",
    "suppose that @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a local hermitian system operator with @xmath74 and @xmath75 is a hermitian bath operator . then combining the condition @xmath20 with eq .",
    "( [ short - range ] ) implies in particular that @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the fourier transform of the bath s two - point correlation function , defined by @xmath78 ( @xmath79 denotes the interaction - picture bath operator ) .",
    "suppose that the fluctuations of the bath variables are ohmic ( and at zero temperature ) ; that is , linear in frequency at low ( positive ) frequency and exponentially decaying at frequencies large compared to the cutoff frequency @xmath80 : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a positive dimensionless parameter quantifying the strength of the ohmic noise",
    ". then the threshold condition implies that @xmath83 for the case of ohmic noise , then , the quantity that is required to be small is linearly `` ultraviolet divergent ; '' that is , it has a linear sensitivity to the high - frequency cutoff @xmath80 , which may be orders of magnitude higher than the characteristic frequency @xmath84 of the ideal computation .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of the threshold condition to the very - high - frequency noise seems surprising , since one s naive expectation is that noise with zero mean and frequency much larger than @xmath84 should nearly average out .",
    "this unsatisfying limitation of eq .",
    "( [ short - range ] ) , already pointed out in the original paper by terhal and burkard @xcite ( and later highlighted by alicki @xcite and by hines and stamp @xcite ) may just be a shortcoming of the analysis , but conceivably it hints at a deeper problem for quantum fault tolerance .",
    "for example , it has been suggested @xcite that during the course of a long quantum computation , an initially benign state of the bath may be pushed toward a far more malicious state that compromises the fault - tolerant protocol .",
    "perhaps high - frequency noise with zero mean , which locally seems incapable of inflicting serious harm , has cumulative global effects that are surprisingly troublesome .",

    "it has been understood that the initial state @xmath42 of the system includes all of the ancilla qubits that will be needed during the full course of the computation . but to model the actual situation , in which ancilla qubits are prepared as needed just before being used , we imagine that ancilla qubits are perfectly isolated from the bath until `` opened '' at the onset of the gadget in which they participate .",
    "similarly , we imagine that the measurements of all ancilla qubits are delayed until the very end of the computation , but that these qubits are `` closed '' ( their coupling to the bath is turned off ) at the conclusion of the gadget in which they participate . with these stipulations ,",
    "our noise model is equivalent to one in which ancilla qubits are repeatedly measured , reset , and reused .",
    "we model the noisy preparation of an ancilla qubit as an ideal preparation followed by interaction with the bath for a specified duration .",
    "since the state of the bath may evolve during the computation , the noise in the preparation may also depend on when the qubit is prepared .",
    "still , we are taking it for granted that `` pretty good '' fresh ancillas can be prepared at any time , or equivalently that qubits can be effectively erased at any time .",
    "implicitly , we have adopted a `` two - reservoir '' hypothesis .",
    "one reservoir , which we have called the `` bath , '' interacts with the system qubits , causing noise .",
    "the other reservoir is the entropy `` sink , '' which carries away heat each time a qubit is erased . in our model , the bath and the sink are uncoupled , and the sink has infinite heat capacity  it never heats up no matter how many qubit erasures occur .    because the bath interacts with the system , in principle",
    "it might be driven far from its initial state in a manner that depends on the ideal computation being simulated .",
    "our arguments have shown that , at least if the bath is a system of uncoupled oscillators and its initial state is gaussian , the bath will not be pushed to a highly adversarial state that overpowers our efforts to make the computation robust .",
    "one wonders how that conclusion could be altered if we relax the two - reservoir hypothesis by coupling the sink and the bath , or by eliminating the sink entirely .",
    "for example , we could attempt to model measurement and erasure more realistically by including entropy flow from the system to the bath . in that case",

    "the goal would be to specify conditions under which the entropy flow from system to bath can be maintained well enough to support scalable quantum computation .",
    "for now , we put aside this ambitious project as an open problem for future consideration .",
    "some fault - tolerant gadgets include _",
    "postselection_. for example , a gadget might consume a disposable piece of `` quantum software , '' an encoded ancilla state that is prepared offline and verified before coming into contact with the encoded data processed by the computation .",
    "the verification procedure includes measurements that check the accuracy of the preparation of the software , and the software is accepted only if the measurements have suitable outcomes ; otherwise the software is rejected and the preparation is repeated .",
    "therefore , estimates of the reliability of gadgets are conditioned on acceptance of the software , which is said to have a `` postselected '' state .",
    "some fault - tolerant protocols , such as those analyzed in @xcite make `` extreme '' use of postselection , meaning that the software is usually rejected and the preparation is typically repeated many times before it finally succeeds . for",
    "such protocols , noise with adversarial correlations can be a formidable foe , since the adversary is empowered to enhance the probability of acceptance for atypical fault paths that are especially damaging .",
    "thus , the threshold estimates based on extreme postselection proved in @xcite apply for independent noise but not for local stochastic noise .",
    "but other protocols , such as those analyzed in @xcite , make only `` modest '' use of postselection , meaning that software is accepted with reasonably high probability . for such protocols , a gadget s failure rate , conditioned on acceptance of the software , can be easily estimated using the bayes rule , even for the case of local stochastic noise .",
    "the threshold estimate for local noise whose proof is sketched in appendix a applies to a protocol with no postselection at all . for local noise , as for local stochastic noise , we do not know how to extend this proof to a protocol with extreme postselection .",
    "but it _ can _ be extended to a protocol with modest postselection .",
    "this observation is useful , because threshold estimates based on protocols with modest postselection are typically higher than estimates based on protocols without postselection .    before considering the case of local coherent noise , we recall how protocols with modest postselection can be analyzed for the case of local stochastic noise @xcite ; to be concrete , we will discuss the case where the level-1 gadgets are based on a quantum error - correcting code that corrects one error in a block . a properly designed gadget processes encoded data",

    "there is another way to describe this estimate that is more readily generalized to the case of local coherent noise , and also clarifies why the estimate applies to adversarial local stochastic noise .",

    "similarly , the probability that ancilla @xmath190 is the first to be accepted and the gadget fails is @xmath300 , and the probability that all @xmath104 ancillas are rejected is @xmath301 . summing the probability of all failure scenarios , we find @xmath302 in the limit @xmath303",

    ", we sum over all failure scenarios at each of @xmath3 marked locations , and conclude that the probability that all @xmath3 locations are bad is bounded above by @xmath309 .",
    "we can also apply this strategy of summing over all failure scenarios in the case of local coherent noise .",
    "first we note that , to preserve the framework assumed in sec .",
    "[ sec : derivation ]",
    ", we may imagine that all measurements in verification steps are postponed until the end of the computation . in the actual circuit",

    "this circuit in the framework where all measurements are postponed , we suppose that a verification qubit decouples from the bath at the time when it is measured in the actual circuit , and we replace operations conditioned on measurement outcomes by noiseless quantum gates conditioned on the state of the verification qubit , after decoupling from the bath but prior to being measured .",
    "then we can estimate @xmath310 by summing over @xmath311 failure scenarios at each of the @xmath3 marked locations . in scenario 1 , ancilla 1 is accepted and the gadget using ancilla 1 ( including the preparation and verification of ancilla 1 ) has two or more faults . in scenario @xmath190 , for @xmath312 , the first @xmath313 ancillas are rejected , ancilla @xmath190 is accepted , and the gadget using ancilla @xmath190 has two or more faults . in scenario",
    "@xmath297 , all @xmath104 ancillas are rejected .",
    "since the scenarios are perfectly distinguishable , they should be summed incoherently .",
    "now , in order for an ancilla to be rejected , there must be at least one fault in the circuit that prepares and verifies that ancilla .",
    "therefore , in scenario @xmath190 , we sum coherently over all fault paths such that there is at least one fault in each of the first @xmath313 ancilla preparation / verification circuits , and at least two faults in the gadget using ancilla @xmath190 .",
    "this sum includes all of the fault paths that contribute to the badness of the gadget under scenario @xmath190 , but it also includes other fault paths that do not contribute to scenario @xmath190 .",

    "this coherent sum for each scenario can be estimated by the method described in appendix a. one finds that , for gadgets such that the `` postselection correction '' to @xmath308 is small in the case of local stochastic noise , the correction is small for local coherent noise as well .    in @xcite ,",
    "the lower bound on the accuracy threshold @xmath314 was established for local stochastic noise , based on a protocol with modest use of postselection .",

    "one possible approach is to allow the bath fluctuations to be weakly non - gaussian by including small anharmonic corrections in the bath hamiltonian @xmath34 .",
    "but , though the effects of bath self - interactions can be analyzed perturbatively by standard methods , obtaining useful rigorous results summed to all orders of perturbation theory is not simple .",
    "another worthy goal , already emphasized at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : implications ] , is to formulate a threshold condition less sensitive to the high - frequency fluctuations of the bath ; i.e. , to noise with a frequency large compared to the natural frequencies of the ideal system hamiltonian @xmath33 . in principle",
    "this might be done by `` integrating out '' high - frequency noise , obtaining an effective noise model with a lower frequency cutoff that faithfully reproduces the impact of the noise on the simulated computation .",
    "making such an analysis rigorous is another challenging open problem . in the next section , though , we will discuss one special case in which an improved threshold estimate less sensitive to high - frequency noise can be achieved .",
    "as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : class1 ] , our general arguments do not place any constraints on the frequency spectrum of the `` hybrid - picture '' system operators .",
    "therefore , we were forced to take the modulus of the bath two - point function in our estimate of the noise strength @xmath1 . and",
    "as a result , our estimate has a sensitivity to high - frequency bath fluctuations that seems rather artificial .",
    "there is at least one case where we have much better analytic control over the time - dependence of the system operators , allowing us to obtain a better estimate of the noise strength that has milder sensitivity to high - frequency noise .",
    "that is the case of pure dephasing noise , which we will discuss now .    in this noise model ,",
    "the bath couples only to the @xmath134-components of the qubits , so that the system - bath hamiltonian is @xmath316 where @xmath317 is a gaussian bath variable with mean zero . to further simplify the discussion ( whose purpose is merely illustrative anyway ) , we will also assume there are no multi - qubit correlations in the noise ( even though this might not be an accurate description of the noise in multi - qubit gates ) .",
    "that is , we assume @xmath318 for @xmath319 , so that in effect each qubit is coupled to its own independent bath .    a scheme for fault - tolerant quantum computation customized for highly - biased noise dominated by dephasing was formulated in @xcite and further discussed in @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "all gates are teleported",
    ". furthermore the only fundamental operations used are single - qubit preparations , single - qubit measurements in the @xmath320-eigenstate basis , and two - qubit controlled - phase ( cphase ) gates .",
    "a cphase gate is diagonal in the computational ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath321-eigenstate ) basis , with eigenvalues @xmath322 .",
    "thus it can be realized by a time - dependent two - qubit system hamiltonian that is also diagonal : @xmath323 where @xmath324 .",
    "this diagonal system hamiltonian commutes with the system - bath hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ diagonal - system - bath ] ) , whose action on the system qubits is diagonal . as in previous sections , we model a noisy qubit preparation as an ideal preparation followed by interaction with the oscillator bath , and we model a noisy measurement as interaction with the bath followed by an ideal measurement",
    ".    we can analyze the effect of the noise on the computation using interaction - picture perturbation theory , and in fact we can estimate a _ probability _",
    "( rather than an amplitude ) for the outcome of a qubit measurement to differ from the measurement outcome in the ideal computation .",
    "for each qubit , we distinguish between _ good _ diagrams , in which the perturbation @xmath35 is inserted an _ even _ number of times in between the ( ideal ) qubit preparation and the ( ideal ) qubit measurement , and the _ bad _ diagrams , in which the perturbation is inserted an _ odd _ number of times in between the preparation and the measurement . because @xmath321 commutes with the ideal system hamiltonian @xmath33 , and because @xmath325 , in all good diagrams the outcome of the final @xmath320 measurement agrees with the result in the ideal quantum circuit , while in bad diagrams the measurement outcome is flipped .",
    "furthermore , the good and the bad part of the system - bath state @xmath47 are mutually orthogonal . to see this , imagine evaluating the inner product @xmath326 between the good and bad parts of the state for a single qubit and its associated bath .",
    "since @xmath327 has an odd number of perturbation insertions and @xmath328 has an even number , each keldysh diagram contributing to @xmath326 is proportional to the expectation value of a product of an odd number of interaction - picture bath fields .",
    "all such diagrams vanish , since @xmath329 is gaussian with mean zero . because the good and bad parts of @xmath47 are perfectly distinguishable",
    ", we can regard @xmath330 as the _ probability _ of error in the final qubit measurement .",
    "let us compute this probability .",
    "the sum of all keldysh diagrams ( both good and bad ) contributing to @xmath331 for a single qubit is the exponential of the sum of `` connected '' diagrams .",
    "there are three connected diagrams , shown in fig .",

    "thus , @xmath337 if @xmath338 is the elapsed time between the preparation and measurement of the qubit , then @xmath339 where @xmath340 ( we have assumed the noise is stationary ) .    in the case of zero - temperature ohmic noise , with @xmath152 given by eq .",
    "( [ ohmic - spectrum ] ) , we find that @xmath341 thus the quantity @xmath133 ( an upper bound on the probability @xmath342 of a measurement error ) has only a mild logarithmic sensitivity to the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath80 , in contrast to the power dependence on the cutoff found in eq .",
    "( [ ohmic - integral ] ) .",
    "this improvement occurs because @xmath133 is found by integrating the bath two - point function @xmath154 , rather than its modulus @xmath343 , which can be justified because the perturbation @xmath35 commutes with the ideal system hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "even this logarithmic dependence on @xmath143 may be spurious ; it arises because we have assumed that the ideal qubit preparation ( at time @xmath155 ) and qubit measurement ( at time @xmath344 ) are instantaneous .",
    "the divergence would be softened further if we used a smoother model of preparation and measurement .",
    "perhaps the logarithmic dependence of the error probability on the elapsed time @xmath338 should not be taken too seriously ; it applies only if the noise spectrum is ohmic down to a frequency of order @xmath345 .",
    "let us nevertheless pursue the implications of this behavior .",
    "the crux of the scheme formulated in @xcite is a teleported logical cnot gate protected against dephasing by an @xmath104-qubit repetition code ( where @xmath104 is odd ) .",
    "this cnot gadget contains four logical measurements , each of which is decoded by a majority vote .",
    "furthermore , for each qubit , there are at most @xmath346 time steps ( each of duration @xmath55 ) in between the preparation and measurement of the qubit , where a cphase gate acts on the qubit in each step .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath347 of an encoded error in this cnot gadget can be bounded as @xmath348 where @xmath349 ( here we have allowed the noise to act for a time @xmath55 during each cphase gate and also during the initial preparation and final measurement ) .",
    "hence the logical cnot gate is well protected if @xmath82 is small and @xmath350 is not too large .    while the underlying noise model is gaussian dephasing noise , under our assumptions the effective noise model for the cnot gadgets is independent stochastic noise .",

    "the quantum accuracy threshold theorem indicates that scalable quantum computing is feasible in principle . but",
    "will fault - tolerant quantum computation _ really _ work ?",
    "one concern is that the noise models assumed by theorists are highly idealized , at best crude approximations to the noise in actual devices . in formulating these models ,",
    "one desires on the one hand to capture essential features of realistic noise , but on the other hand to allow a succinct and elegant analysis of the computation s reliability .    seeking an appropriate balance between these two desiderata , we have proved in this paper a new version of the threshold theorem that applies to gaussian quantum noise , which is physically well motivated and analytically tractable .",
    "our result shows that quantum computing is scalable if the noise power spectrum obeys a certain condition .",
    "compared to previous results regarding the effectiveness of fault - tolerant methods against non - markovian noise @xcite , our threshold condition has two advantages : it is expressed in terms of experimentally observable features of the noise , and it is less sensitive to high - frequency noise .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : generalizations ] , it might be useful to extend our results by relaxing the noise model in several ways , for example by including weak non - gaussian corrections to the bath fluctuations , or by modeling more realistically the dissipative flow of heat from system to bath .",
    "it should also be possible to make further improvements in the sensitivity of the threshold condition to high - frequency noise ; however , an improved condition would be likely to depend on the details of the frequency spectrum of the ideal system dynamics , and deriving it would require a more complicated analysis .",

    "here we will briefly sketch the proof of the quantum accuracy threshold theorem for local noise , following the argument in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the joint evolution of the quantum computer ( the system @xmath357 ) and its environment ( the bath @xmath276 ) is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath358 , where the perturbation @xmath35 is responsible for the deviation of the system from its ideal evolution . although this framework can be generalized ( as discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : generalizations ] ) , we also assume that the system qubits are initialized ideally in the pure state @xmath42 before the hamiltonian evolution begins and measured ideally after it ends . furthermore , the initial state of the bath is the pure state @xmath43 .",
    "just before the ideal measurements are performed on the system qubits , the joint state of the system and bath is @xmath359 , where @xmath40 is the time - evolution operator determined by @xmath31 , and @xmath360 .",
    "we obtain a fault - path expansion for @xmath47 by expanding @xmath40 as a power series in @xmath35 , and for each term in this expansion we declare a level-0 circuit location to be bad if @xmath35 acts nontrivially somewhere within that location .    for any specified set @xmath2 of @xmath3 locations in the circuit ,",
    "we denote by @xmath46 the sum of all the terms in the fault - path expansion of @xmath47 such that all of these @xmath3 locations are bad .",
    "the noise is local with strength @xmath1 if @xmath361 our objective is to show that scalable quantum computing is possible provided that @xmath20 , where @xmath27 is ( a lower bound on ) the accuracy threshold .",
    "suppose that a universal set of fault - tolerant level-1 gadgets can be constructed such that a 1-gadget containing fewer than @xmath203 faulty level-0 gates simulates the corresponding ideal 0-gate correctly .",
    "we can estimate the effective noise strength for a level-1 simulation using the following observation : consider a set @xmath362 of level-0 locations in a quantum circuit .",
    "then the sum of all fault paths such that at least @xmath203 of the locations in the set @xmath362 are faulty can be expressed as @xmath363 where @xmath364 denotes the sum over all subsets of @xmath362 that contain @xmath365 elements .",
    "( [ inclusion - exclusion ] ) follows from the `` inclusion - exclusion principle '' of combinatorics .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath366 it becomes @xmath367 whose origin is easy to understand .",
    "the first term counts correctly each fault path with exactly one fault in @xmath362 , but it double - counts each fault path with exactly two faults , and this over - counting is corrected by the second term .",
    "the first term counts three times each fault path with exactly three faults , and the second term subtracts these fault paths @xmath368 times ; this under - counting is corrected by the third term .",
    "and so on .    the norm of the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ inclusion - exclusion ] ) is bounded above by the sum of the norms of the terms on the right hand side . using @xmath369 and denoting @xmath370 we find @xmath371 here",
    "@xmath372 is a constant satisfying @xmath373 for values of @xmath1 in some specified range of interest , which typically can be chosen such that @xmath372 is close to 1 .    in a level-1 simulation of a quantum circuit ,",
    "let us say that a level-1 gadget is `` bad '' if it contains @xmath203 or more bad level-0 gates , and let @xmath374 denote a set of @xmath3 specified level-1 gadgets .",
    "we assume , for now , that these level-1 gadgets are nonoverlapping ; _ i.e. _ , that no 0-gate is contained in two different 1-gadgets .",
    "we denote by @xmath375 the sum of all terms in the perturbation expansion of @xmath47 such that all of the @xmath3 1-gadgets in @xmath374 are bad . by performing an `` inclusion - exclusion '' sum independently inside each 1-gadget , we find that @xmath376 denotes the set of 0-gates inside the 1-gadget @xmath67 , for @xmath377 , and @xmath378 denotes the sum over all subsets of @xmath379 that contain @xmath380 elements .",
    "the local noise condition @xmath369 implies that @xmath381 as above , we can bound the norm of the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ inclusion - exclusion - level1 ] ) by the sum of the norms of the terms on the right - hand side .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ local - noise - level1 ] ) , this upper bound factorizes into a product of @xmath3 sums , each of which can be bounded as in eq  ( [ s - fault - bound ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath382 where @xmath383 and hence @xmath384 where @xmath385 here @xmath386 , @xmath387 , and the maximum is over all 1-gadgets in the circuit .",
    "we can regard @xmath308 as an effective noise strength for the level-1 circuit , which is conveniently expressed in the form @xmath388 where @xmath389 and the minimum is over all 1-gadgets in our universal set .",
    "now let us say that a level-@xmath13 gadget is bad if it contains @xmath203 or more bad @xmath14-gadgets .",
    "the bound eq .",
    "( [ noise - strength - level1 ] ) on the norm of the sum @xmath375 over all fault paths that are bad at level 1 is of the same form as the bound eq .",
    "( [ local - noise - strength - again ] ) on the norm of the sum over all fault paths that are bad at level 0 , but with a `` renormalized '' value of the effective noise strength .",
    "this means that in a recursive simulation , in which @xmath13-gadgets are constructed using the same circuits as 1-gadgets , but with each 0-gate in the 1-gadget replaced by a ( @xmath390)-gadget , we can use the same combinatoric argument again to estimate the effective noise strength at level @xmath13 .",
    "that is , suppose that @xmath391 where @xmath392 is any specified set of @xmath3 @xmath14-gadgets in a level-@xmath14 simulation , and @xmath393 denotes the sum of all fault paths such that all @xmath3 of the @xmath14-gadgets in @xmath392 are bad .",
    "then we may infer that @xmath394 where @xmath49 is any specified set of @xmath3 @xmath13-gadgets in a level-@xmath13 simulation , @xmath50 denotes the sum of all fault paths such that all @xmath3 of the @xmath13-gadgets in @xmath49 are bad , and @xmath395    the fault - path expansion of a level-@xmath13 simulation with all together @xmath22 @xmath13-gadgets can be expressed as @xmath396 is the sum of all fault paths such that every @xmath13-gadget is good , and @xmath397 is the sum of all fault paths such that at least one @xmath13-gadget is bad . combining the @xmath366 case of eq .",
    "( [ s - fault - bound ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ level - k - local - noise ] ) , then , we see that @xmath398 which is small for @xmath399 .",
    "furthermore , the arguments in @xcite show that if @xmath47 is good then the probability distribution @xmath400 governing the measurement outcome for the _ logical _ system qubits ( where @xmath401 is the probability of the measurement outcome labeled by @xmath402 ) matches exactly the probability distribution @xmath403 for the measurement outcomes in the ideal computation .",
    "therefore , the deviation of the @xmath404 from @xmath403 in the noisy simulation arises only from the small bad component of @xmath47 ; in fact in the @xmath405 norm this deviation can be bounded as @xmath406 therefore , for @xmath20 , the noisy computation becomes highly reliable as the level @xmath13 of the simulation increases ; thus @xmath27 is a lower bound on the accuracy threshold for quantum computation .    in @xcite ,",
    "two valuable extensions of this argument were formulated that are useful for pushing the threshold estimate @xmath27 higher .",
    "first , the argument can be applied to simulations where successive 1-gadgets _ overlap _ , _ i.e. _ , have 0-gates in common . by allowing the gadgets to overlap , we can justify the estimate eq .",
    "( [ threshold - estimate - combinatoric ] ) when using properly designed gadgets based on a quantum error - correcting code that can correct @xmath407 errors in a code block .",
    "second , we can refine the definition of badness , so that a 1-gadget with @xmath203 or more faults is declared bad only if the faults occur at a `` malignant '' set of locations , _",
    "i.e. _ , only if the 1-gadget processes encoded information incorrectly because of the faults . for example , for gadgets that can correct one error ( the @xmath408 case ) , our estimate of the level-1 effective noise strength improves to @xmath409 where @xmath276 is the number of malignant _ pairs _ of fault locations in the 1-gadget ( maximized over all 1-gadgets ) , @xmath410 is a correction arising from summing contributions from fault paths with three of more faults in the 1-gadget , and @xmath411 is our improved threshold estimate , found by solving the equation @xmath412 ."
