    "several candidates for a constructive definition of superstring theory have recently attracted attention . here",
    "we focus on the ikkt model ( or iib matrix model ) @xcite , which is supposed to correspond to iib superstring theory in the large @xmath0 limit . that correspondence is supported by some analytical arguments .",
    "this matrix model is formally obtained from ordinary super ym gauge theory in the zero volume limit ( one point ) .    here",
    "we study directly the large @xmath0 dynamics of large @xmath0 reduced matrix models .",
    "some results were obtained before for the `` bosonic case '' ( where the fermions are dropped by hand ) , but we now want to address mainly the susy case .",
    "in particular we simulate the 4d counterpart of the ikkt model @xcite  we denote it as 4d iib matrix model  which corresponds again to the dimensional reduction of 4d super ym gauge theory .",
    "this model has also been studied analytically @xcite and numerically in the framework of dynamical triangularization @xcite . here",
    "we report on direct monte carlo simulations using the hybrid r algorithm @xcite .",
    "conclusive results can be obtained because in the 4d version the fermion determinant is real positive  in contrast to the 10d ikkt model , where simulations would be plagued by a sign problem .",
    "we got away with a computational effort of @xmath1 in the susy case , and of @xmath2 in the bosonic case .",
    "the 4d iib matrix model is given by @xmath3^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ s_{f } & = & -\\frac{1}{g^{2 } } \\ , { \\rm tr } ( \\bar \\psi_{\\alpha }   \\gamma^{\\mu}_{\\alpha \\beta } [ a_{\\mu},\\psi_{\\beta}])\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are complex , traceless @xmath6 matrices , and the @xmath7 ( only ) are hermitean .",
    "we use @xmath8 .",
    "in addition to susy and so(4 ) invariance , this model has a su(@xmath0 ) symmetry , which is inherited from gauge invariance .",
    "the first question about this model is if it is well - defined as it stands .",
    "since the integration domain of @xmath9 is non - compact , divergences are conceivable .",
    "however , our results , as well as results on a number of special cases @xcite confirm consistently that this model _ is _ well - defined at any @xmath0 ; there is no need to impose a ir cutoff .",
    "this implies that the only parameter @xmath10 is simply a _",
    "scale parameter _ , rather than a coupling constant .",
    "it can be absorbed by introducing dimensionless quantities .",
    "the challenge is , however , to tune @xmath10 as a function of @xmath0 so that the correlators are finite at @xmath11 , see sections 4 and 5 .",
    "in the iib matrix model , the space coordinates arise dynamically from the eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath7 @xcite . in general the latter",
    "can not be diagonalized simultaneously , which implies that we deal with a non - classical space .",
    "we measure its uncertainty by @xmath12 \\ , \\ ] ] and the `` maximizing '' matrix @xmath13 is also used for introducing the coordinates of @xmath0 points , @xmath14 what we are really interested in is their pairwise separation @xmath15 , and we show the distribution @xmath16 in fig .  1 .",
    "we observe @xmath17 at short distances ( @xmath18 ) , hence a uv cutoff is generated _",
    "dynamically_. we also see that increasing @xmath0 favors larger values of @xmath19 . to quantify this effect we measure",
    "the `` extent of space '' diverges , since @xmath20 at large @xmath19 ( see second ref .  in @xcite ) . ]",
    "@xmath21 fig .",
    "2 shows @xmath22 and @xmath23 as functions of @xmath0 ( at @xmath24 ) . the inclusion of fermions enhances @xmath22 and suppresses @xmath23 , keeping their product approximately constant .",
    "the lines show that both quantities follow the same power law , @xmath25 , in susy and in the bosonic case . in susy",
    "this behavior is consistent with the branched polymer picture : there one would relate the number of points as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is some minimal bond , which corresponds to the above uv cutoff .",
    "the hausdorff dimension @xmath28 then reveals consistency with our result .",
    "we define the polyakov loop @xmath29 and the wilson loop @xmath30  which is conjectured to correspond to the string creation operator  as @xmath31 of course the choice of the components of @xmath7 is irrelevant , and the parameter @xmath32 can be considered as a `` momentum '' .",
    "now @xmath33 has to be tuned so that @xmath34 remain finite as @xmath35 .",
    "this is achieved by @xmath36 which leads to a beautiful large @xmath0 scaling ; fig .",
    "3 shows the invariance of @xmath37 for @xmath38 in susy .",
    "also the bosonic case scales accurately @xcite .    the historic 2d eguchi - kawai model @xcite had a @xmath39 symmetry , which implied @xmath40 , a property which was crucial for the proof of the eguchi - kawai equivalence to gauge theory .",
    "as we see , this property is not fulfilled here , but @xmath41 falls off rapidly , towards a regime where the assumption of this proof holds approximately .",
    "we proceed to a more explicit test of eguchi - kawai equivalence by checking the area law for @xmath42 .",
    "4 shows that the area law seems to hold in a finite range of scale .",
    "remarkably , the behavior is very similar @xcite in the bosonic case .",
    "there we further investigated the behavior at much larger @xmath0 @xcite , and we observed that the power law regime does neither shrink to zero  as it was generally expected  nor extend to infinity  a scenario which seems possible from fig .",
    "4 . at least in the bosonic case",
    "its range remains finite at large @xmath0 .",
    "recently the same behavior was observed in a study of the 10d bosonic case @xcite .",
    "we now consider connected multipoint functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 being a polyakov or a wilson loop .",
    "we wonder if it is possible to renormalize all of those multipoint functions simply by inserting @xmath45 , so that a single factor @xmath46 renders all functions @xmath47 ( simultaneously ) finite at large @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that such a universal renormalization factor seems to exist in susy .",
    "we have to set again @xmath48 , and then @xmath49 provides large @xmath0 scaling , as we observed for a set of 2 , 3 and 4-point functions .",
    "two examples are shown in fig .",
    "our observation can be summarized by the susy rule @xmath50 this implies that large @xmath0 factorization holds , @xmath51 , as in gauge theory , although coupling expansions are not applicable here .    for the bosonic case",
    ", a @xmath52 expansion @xcite suggests large @xmath0 factorization to hold as well , but it also predicts @xmath53 .",
    "this is confirmed numerically @xcite : in particular the 3-point functions shown in fig .",
    "5 now requires @xmath54 .",
    "therefore no universal renormalization factor @xmath46 exists in the bosonic case , which is an important qualitative difference from the susy case .",
    "we also performed simulations in @xmath55 @xcite , where we simplified the ikkt model as follows :    \\(1 ) we use a 1-loop approximation , which is expected to capture the low energy dynamics .",
    "this amounts to an effective action , keeping track of off - diagonal elements only to the quadratic order , in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) we omit the phase of the pfaffian by hand , in order to avoid the sign problem .",
    "thus a monte carlo study becomes feasible .",
    "the validity of ( 1 ) is supported by our results for @xmath22 , but ( 2 ) is certainly a drastic step . still one could hope to observe basic properties of the ikkt model at least qualitatively .",
    "these simplifications allow for a simulation effort of only @xmath2 .",
    "our main interest here is if the eigenvalue distribution of the @xmath7 indicates a spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of so(10 ) invariance , as it was suggested in the formulation of the ikkt model @xcite .    to this end",
    ", we consider the moment of inertia @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , and we measure its 10 eigenvalues",
    ". a gap in this spectrum would indicate the ssb of lorentz symmetry .",
    "however , this can not be observed , even though we raised @xmath0 up to 512 . on the contrary ,",
    "we observe that the eigenvalue distribution becomes more and more isotropic as @xmath0 increases , see fig .  6 , and the same is true in @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that if ssb of lorentz symmetry occurs in the ikkt model , then it must be driven by the imaginary part of the action .",
    "we first simulated the 4d iib matrix model , both , susy and bosonic .",
    "we varied @xmath0 up to 48 , which turned out to be sufficient to study the large @xmath0 dynamics .",
    "we confirmed that the model is well - defined as it stands , hence @xmath10 is a pure scale parameter .",
    "the space coordinates arise from eigenvalues of the bosonic matrices @xmath7 .",
    "the extent of space follows a power law . in susy",
    "this agrees with the branched polymer picture .",
    "fermions leave the power unchanged but reduce the space uncertainty  though it remains finite at large @xmath0 .",
    "the large @xmath0 scaling of polyakov and wilson loops and their correlators requires @xmath48 in susy and in the bosonic case , but the wave function renormalization is qualitatively different : only in susy a universal renormalization exists .",
    "the area law for wilson loops holds in a finite range of scale for the susy and the bosonic case .",
    "the latter comes as a surprise , and we checked up to rather large @xmath0 that this range remains indeed finite .",
    "hence eguchi - kawai equivalence to ordinary gauge theory @xcite may hold in some regime ."
