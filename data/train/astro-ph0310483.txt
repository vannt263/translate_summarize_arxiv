    "neutron - star magnetic fields are determined in both x - ray and radio pulsars .",
    "the cyclotron resonance scattering features in the x - ray spectrum of accreting neutron stars allow an estimate of the field strengths .",
    "the results lie in a narrow range between ( 1 - 4)@xmath0 g ( makishima et  al .",
    "1999 ) , for both young systems and systems as old as @xmath1 years .",
    "this strongly suggests that neutron - star magnetic fields do not decay spontaneously .",
    "in contrast , three arguments have been put forward for rapid ( @xmath2myr ) field decay in radio pulsars .",
    "firstly , the anti - correlation of characteristic age ( @xmath3 ) and magnetic field strength , or more correctly , torque ( @xmath4 ) , seems to indicate magnetic field decay .",
    "it is better explained by the strong dependence of the quantities plotted .",
    "secondly , field decay could explain the scarcity of far - away pulsars , as they stop shining before they cover large distances . yet",
    "since these distances are derived from dispersion measures , they will be systematicly underestimated for pulsars beyond the galactic gas layer ( bhattacharya & verbunt 1991 ) , causing an apparent lack of far - away pulsars .",
    "thirdly , if magnetic fields or torques do not decay , one expects more pulsars with long periods than are observed .",
    "a decrease in visibility with time could also explain this shortage ; in fact , both vivekanand & narayan ( 1981 ) and lyne & manchester ( 1988 ) find that pulsars with longer periods have significantly narrower beams , making it less likely for them to be detected .",
    "in a pulsar - population synthesis code , one models the birth , life and death of radio pulsars and compares each simulated sample with the real sample .",
    "certain pulsars ( nearby , slow , bright ones for example ) are more easily discovered than others and will be overrepresented in the sample . to account for these selection effects",
    ", one must explicitly model the surveys in which pulsars are detected .",
    "our code is a parallelised version of the one described by bhattacharya et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) and hartman et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) and runs on teras , the 1024-processor 1 tflop / s supercomputer at sara . in short ,",
    "the algorithm is as follows : in the initial settings we assume distributions for the pulsar properties at birth , and fix the time - scale for exponential magnetic field decay . the properties of each simulated pulsar are drawn from the initial distributions .",
    "we evolve the magnetic field and period , calculate the orbit though the galaxy and determine the size of the radio beam .",
    "we then check whether any of the incorporated surveys discover the pulsar , and repeat the loop until we have detected 2000 simulated pulsars .",
    "we compare their properties to those of real pulsars , vary the input settings and restart the synthesis , until the optimum solution is reached .",
    "bhattacharya et  al .  ( 1992 ) and hartman et  al .  ( 1997 ) found that models with long magnetic field decay times reproduced the observations best . forcing the use of a short decay time ,",
    "the simulation would only resemble the observed data after the introduction of a second pulsar population , with longer periods at birth , as was also found by narayan & ostriker ( 1990 ) .",
    "cordes & chernoff ( 1998 ) investigate the velocities and spin - down laws in 49 young pulsars .",
    "they assume a constant beaming fraction and find a magnetic field decay time of less than 10 myr .",
    "arzoumanian et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) use a period - dependent beaming model to generate pulse profiles .",
    "they do not , however , use this new beaming model to fit for the magnetic field decay time , but mention the value found by cordes & chernoff ( 1998 ) instead : less than 10 myr .",
    "we have implemented pulse profiles in the way described by arzoumanian et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , but still find that the observed pulsar properties are best reproduced in a model without field decay",
    ". however , if we follow cordes & chernoff ( 1998 ) in assuming that the beaming fraction does not depend on the period , we reproduce their result and find that the best model has a decay time of order 10myr .",
    "arzoumanian et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) further argue that all pulsars with the same @xmath5 and @xmath6 have the same intrinsic ( angle - averaged ) luminosity and that the observed luminosity depends on the observation angle and interstellar scintillation . as the width of the resulting observed luminosity distribution is of the same magnitude as the intrinsic spread in the narayan & ostriker ( 1990 ) luminosity function , the two descriptions are computationally almost identical .",
    "gonthier et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) simulate galactic populations of radio and gamma - ray pulsars . with a beaming fraction constant with period ,",
    "their best model has magnetic field decay in 5myr .",
    "although the exact relation is still subject of debate , it is clear that the beaming fraction decreases with the pulse period ( vivekanand & narayan 1981 , lyne & manchester 1988 ) . if we force our code to disregard this relation , as cordes & chernoff ( 1998 ) , gonthier et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and arzoumanian et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) chose to do , we also need magnetic - field decay on a time - scale of around @xmath7yr to reproduce the observed period distributions .",
    "when we do include period dependence of the beaming fraction and search for the best solution , the no - decay case is much more probable than decay on a 10myr time scale ( van leeuwen & verbunt 2004 ) .",
    "most of the pulsars we detect in our code were born near the sun , which makes us mostly sensitive to the local birthrate . in our best model ( no magnetic field decay )",
    "we need a local birthrate of 2 kpc@xmath8 myr@xmath9 , which can be produced by ob - association stars with masses over @xmath10 ( hartman et  al .",
    "1997 ) . in this model ,",
    "the magnetic field strength is drawn from a log - normal distribution with centre and width @xmath11 g .",
    "this makes no neutron stars with magnetic fields higher than @xmath12 g . to make a substantial number of these , as well as normal radio pulsars , we can shift and widen the distribution to @xmath13 g",
    "this increases the underlying neutron - star birthrate by roughly a factor of 4 .",
    "however , as the input magnetic field distribution is wider , the simulated period distribution and magnetic field distribution are both unacceptably wider than is observed ( see fig . [",
    "img : bphist ] ) .",
    "it therefore seems implausible that radio pulsars and magnetars are formed from a single neutron - star magnetic field distribution .",
    "in previous work on pulsar speeds ( helfand & tademaru 1977 , lyne & lorimer 1994 , cordes & chernoff 1998 ) one argument keeps returning : fast pulsars quickly move away from the plane , and so from our telescopes , either to escape our galaxy or to spend much time far away from it while they reverse direction .",
    "many of these far - away pulsars escape detection , biasing the observed sample to the slow and sedentary pulsars ( see fig . [",
    "img : velo]a )    this argument is valid in the z - direction only ; in a three - dimensional world , the situation is different ( see also hansen & phinney 1997 ) . seen from the earth , most pulsars are born towards the galactic centre . of these",
    ", the high - speed ones can travel the largest distances and these diffuse from the centre outward , towards our part of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ img : velo]b ) .",
    "we find the effect of radial drift to be stronger than the observational selection effect in the z - direction : on the whole , our simulated detected pulsars move faster than the parent population ( van leeuwen & verbunt 2004 ) .",
