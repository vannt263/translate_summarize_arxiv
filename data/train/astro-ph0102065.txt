    "one of the most puzzling aspects of x - ray emission from normal galaxies is the presence of exotic , powerful , apparently point - like x - ray sources in arm regions of some spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "we call them `` ultra - luminous compact x - ray sources ( ulxs ) '' , because their luminosities , typically 10@xmath6 , are one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of the most luminous galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "since the eddington limit for an object with mass @xmath7 is expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the solar mass , ulxs were regarded as mass accreting black - hole binaries ( bhbs ) involving massive ( 50100  @xmath9 ) stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ) , or neutron - star binaries ( nsbs ) with highly collimated x - ray emission .",
    "however , both explanations remained speculative , because x - ray spectra of ulxs were poorly known .    the breakthrough has been brought by _ asca _",
    "@xcite , thanks to its fine spectral capability with a modest angular resolution . following previous works on individual ulxs ( e.g. , ic  342 source  1 ; okada et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xcite have performed an extensive spectral investigation of ulxs , and found that their spectra are commonly represented by a so - called multi - color disk - blackbody ( mcd ) model that describes emission from an accretion disk around a compact star @xcite , strongly reinforcing the bh interpretation .",
    "the mcd model provides two basic quantities of the accretion disk ; the inner - most disk temperature , @xmath5 , and the inner - most disk radius , @xmath10 . comparing these two quantities of ulxs with those of galactic / magellanic bhbs",
    ", @xcite pointed out that the obtained values of @xmath5 are significantly higher than those of ordinary bhbs , whereas the values of @xmath10 are not so much different . since @xmath10 might correspond to the last stable orbit around a central bh",
    ", this fact implies that the mass of bhs in ulxs are relatively low ( @xmath111020  @xmath9 ) , being inconsistent with their high luminosities . to cope with this issue",
    ", they suggested that the central bh in a ulx is rapidly rotating ( i.e. , a kerr bh ) , hence the disk can get closer to the bh and the observed value of @xmath5 can become higher .",
    "this idea was originally proposed by @xcite to explain the similar high values of @xmath5 found from the two galactic jet sources , gro  j1655 - 40 and grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "although our understanding of ulxs have thus made a great progress , previous works have been dealing only with the time - averaged spectra , and left their spectral variability unexamined .",
    "such a study would bring us key information on the source nature .",
    "for example , @xmath12 observations of variable galactic / magellanic bhbs @xcite revealed that their source luminosities vary as @xmath13 , or @xmath10 remains constant ; this fact implies that an optically - thick , geometrically - thin standard accretion disk @xcite is actually realized around a schwarzschild bh , where the inner disk radius is defined by the last stable circular orbit .",
    "we also point out that in the `` kerr bhbs '' scenario of ulxs , only a decrease of the inner disk radius has been considered .",
    "needless to say , it is also necessary to examine how the relativistic effects ( i.e. , gravitational redshift , doppler shifts , and the light bending ) affect the observed spectra",
    ".    accordingly , we performed ( re-)analysis of the spectra of three luminous ulxs ; ic  342 source  1 , m81 x-6 , and ngc  1313 source  b. the first has the largest flux among the observed ulxs next to m33 x-8 , and showed strong short - term variability @xcite .",
    "the other two have relatively high fluxes and have been observed several times with _ asca _ , and are hence suitable for the study on the spectral variability .",
    "we describe the _ asca _ observation of these sources in the next section , and examine how their spectra varied in   3 .",
    "we discuss their source natures in   4 .",
    "ic  342 is a nearby starburst scd galaxy located close to the galactic plane ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "after @xcite , we assume the distance as 3.9  mpc , although large optical extinction caused by the low galactic latitude makes the distance uncertainty relatively large .",
    "this galaxy has been observed by _ asca _",
    "twice ; in 1993 september and 2000 feburuary . as already described in @xcite , source  1 in this galaxy exhibited a significant variability during the 1993 observation ( see also figure [ fig : ic342 lc ] ) .",
    "accordingly , we investigate the change of its spectral property in detail in   3.1 .",
    "the spectral difference between the 1993 and 2000 observations is described in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "m81 ( ngc  3031 ) has a cepheid - based accurate distance of 3.6  mpc from the hubble space telecsope observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed this galaxy with @xmath15 and detected several sources , including the brightest one , called x-5 @xcite at the nucleus , and the most luminous off - nucleus source called x-6 which we study in the present paper . due to the explosion of sn  1993j",
    ", @xmath3 has frequently observed the m81 region @xcite . among these observations ,",
    "we utilize the data obtained after 1994 , in which sn  1993j had faded away significantly and its contamination to the x-6 spectrum is sufficiently low .",
    "thus we analyzed data from seven observations in total , as shown in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "although the first two datasets were already investigated by @xcite , we here deal with them as well as other five , in order to study the long - term variability .",
    "the same seven datasets were also employed by @xcite , in his study of sn  1993j .",
    "ngc  1313 is a nearby face - on , late - type sb galaxy at a distance of 4.5  mpc @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations using @xmath15  @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath3 @xcite showed that its x - ray emission is dominated by three extremely luminous point - like sources of @xmath18 @xmath11 10@xmath19  erg  s@xmath2 each .",
    "one of them is an x - ray luminous supernova , namely sn  1978k , and the other two are ulxs called source  a and source  b after @xcite .",
    "the former is located close ( @xmath1145@xmath20 ) to the galaxy nucleus , whereas the latter is seen at the south - end of the host galaxy .",
    "this galaxy has been observed by _ asca _",
    "twice , in 1993 july and in 1995 november . @xcite",
    "studied source  b , and showed that the spectrum of this source on either occasion can be expressed by the mcd model with different values of @xmath5 .",
    "we here investigate this ulx for both observations in   3.3 , concentrating on the spectral variability . as for source",
    "a , the two observations will be compared in another paper ( t. mizuno et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the observational log of our target sources is summarized in table  [ tab : sample ] . for m81  x-6",
    ", we did not use the gis data ( see   3.2 ) .",
    "the gis data for ngc  1313 in the second observation was acquired in a bit assignment ( ph  x  y  rt  sp  time ) of 888007 ; this is an exceptional mode which sacrifices rise time information to improve the time resolution ( in search for a pulser in sn  1978k ) , so that we did not apply the off - line rise - time cut screening on the data . for the other gis data and the sis data , we applied a standard data screening and tabulated the net exposure in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "the time - averaged spectra of ic  342 source  1 were already analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they accumulated the on - source spectra from a circular region of 3@xmath21 radius on the source center , subtracted the background spectra extracted from blank - sky observations , and fitted the obtained spectra with single component models . according to their results , the power - law model is completely unacceptable , the thermal bremsstrahlung ( tbs ) model provides much better value of @xmath22 but is also rejected at 99% confidence level , whereas an mcd one gives an acceptable fit .",
    "although the short - term variability of source  1 was already sketched by @xcite and @xcite , we reproduced its gis light curves in figure  [ fig : ic342 lc ] .",
    "as already reported by @xcite and @xcite , the source exhibits clear time variability by a factor of 2 in a few hours , especially in the hard energy band . in order to study this behavior in more detail ,",
    "we divided both the sis and the gis data into five time regions as defined in figure  [ fig : ic342 lc]b , and analyzed the corresponding time - sorted spectra . to grasp the rough information of the spectral variability",
    ", we first summed the phase 2 and 4 spectra into a `` low - flux phase '' spectra , and summed the phase 1 , 3 , and 5 spectra into `` high - flux phase '' spectra , as shown in figure  [ fig : ic342s1_time ] . in agreement with the light curves ,",
    "the difference between the two spectra is more significant at higher energies , indicating that the spectrum hardens as the source flux increases .",
    "we fitted the high - flux phase sis / gis spectra jointly with the mcd model , and obtained the result as given in table  [ tab : fit_ulxs ] ; the fit turned out to be acceptable ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we also fitted the low - flux phase spectra ; the fit is again acceptable ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the best fit values of the line - of - sight absorption are @xmath25 for both spectrua , and are consistent with the time - averaged one obtained by @xcite .",
    "we also found that the disk temperature differs by a factor of 1.3 between two phases , whereas the source flux by a factor of 1.7    in order to examine changes in the physical condition of the accretion disk , we calculated the values of @xmath10 for the spectra of high - flux and low - flux phases . assuming a face - on geometry , they became @xmath26  km and @xmath27  km , respectively , where we adopted the ratio of a color temperature to an effective temperature of 1.7 after @xcite , and applied a correction for the inner - disk boundary condition after @xcite .",
    "to our surprise , the radius @xmath10 does not appear to be constant but increases as the flux decreases ; this behavior contradicts that of ordinary bhbs @xcite . to investigate this inference more quantitatively , we fitted the two sets of spectra simultaneously by constraining @xmath28 and @xmath10 to take the same values between them ( while allowing @xmath5 to vary independently ) , and then letting @xmath10 to change separately .",
    "then , the fit improved from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , indicating that the change of @xmath10 is statistically significant ( at 99% confidence level by an @xmath31-test ) .",
    "although @xmath10 thus changes significantly , it might be an artifact due to wrong modeling of the spectra .",
    "for example , the mcd emission from nsbs is usually accompanied by a black - body hard component , and bhbs in the soft state often exhibit a spectral hard - tail in addition to the mcd component .",
    "fluctuation of such a hard component , if any , might apparently cause the correlated changes of @xmath5 and @xmath10 seen from ic  342 source  1 .",
    "we therefore tried to fit the high / low - flux phase spectra simultaneously by a common mcd model with the same @xmath10 and @xmath5 , adding a hard - component model to the high flux phase spectra only .",
    "the hard component was modeled by a black - body of temperature fixed at 2.0  kev , typical for nsbs @xcite , or a power - law of photon index fixed at @xmath32 , nominal value for bhbs in the soft state @xcite .",
    "then , the mcd plus power - law model could not explain the observed spectra ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the mcd plus black - body model was also statistically unacceptable ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , the observed spectral variability can not be due to fluctuations of the hard component , but should be attributed to the change of the mcd component itself .",
    "we finally fitted five time - sorted spectra for the five time intervals individually by the mcd model , with the absorption fixed at the best - fit value of high / low - flux phase spectra ( @xmath35  @xmath36 ) .",
    "we plotted the confidence contours of the five spectra on the @xmath5@xmath37 plane in figure  [ fig : ic342s1_5_cont.eps ] , where @xmath37 is proportional to the normalization of the mcd model .",
    "then , like we have already found in the two phase spectral fitting , @xmath10 gradually decreases as @xmath5 increases , and the relation is approximately expressed as @xmath38 .",
    "further examination of this result will be discussed in   4 .",
    "when studying the spectrum of x-6 , we should eliminate the contamination from the two nearby sources , sn  1993j and m81  x-5 , the latter being the low - luminosity active - galactic nucleus of m81 @xcite .",
    "this is because x-6 is separated only @xmath111@xmath21 from sn  1993j , and @xmath113@xmath21 from x-5 , as previously reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we accumulated the source spectrum of x-6 from a circular region of 1.@xmath215 radius , to make the contamination from x-5 as low as possible .",
    "for the same reason , we only used the sis data ; the poorer spatial resolution of the gis would increase the x-5 contamination . in the obtained spectrum , nevertheless , typically @xmath1150% photons still originate from x-5 due to its brightness . in order to remove this residual contamination ,",
    "we accumulated a background spectrum over another region having the same size as was used for the on - source spectrum .",
    "this background region is located opposite to x-6 with respect to x-5 , where we expect a similar amount of contamination from x-5 .",
    "we multiplied a constant factor to thus obtained background spectrum , and then subtracted it from the on - source spectrum .",
    "this `` scaling factor '' was introduced to take into account the @xmath3 xrt s asymmetric point spread function , and was determined based on the ray - tracing ( monte - carlo ) simulation developed by the xrt team . by simulating the x-5 event for each observation ( each position of x-5 on the focal plane ) , we can estimate the ratio of photons in the source region to the background region .",
    "the ratio , or the scaling factor , is typically 1.5 , ranging over 1.21.8 .",
    "this procedure also subtracts the non x - ray background ( nxb ) and the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) after multiplying the same scaling factor , which is not precise for the nxb and cxb .",
    "however , we can neglect this effect , since the ratio of the nxb + cxb count rate to that of the contaminated photons from m81  x-5 is estimated to be @xmath39 .",
    "thus , we have obtained the spectrum for x-6 plus sn  1993j .",
    "the contamination from sn  1993j is difficult to eliminate because of their short separation .",
    "instead , we take it into account in a different way . the sn  1993j spectrum was separately estimated by @xcite through one - dimensional sis image analysis , which was originally developed by @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "sn  1993j had faded away significantly after one year from the explosion , and the spectrum is expressed by a power - law of @xmath40 and the x - ray flux @xmath41  =  0.5  @xmath42  0.2  @xmath43  10  @xmath44  erg  s@xmath2  @xmath36 in 1994 april , and of @xmath45 and @xmath41  =  0.2  @xmath42  0.1  @xmath43  10  @xmath44  erg  s@xmath2  @xmath36 in 1994 october , both in the 0.58 kev band . we calculated their contamination to the x-6 spectrum based on the ray - tracing simulation , and took the results into account as a fixed power - law component when fitting the x-6 spectrum , as indicated in figure  [ fig : m81x6 ] .",
    "the contribution of sn  1993j to the 0.510 kev flux turned out to be small ; only @xmath11 10% and @xmath11 3% in 1994 april and october , respectively .",
    "for the other data which were obtained after 1995 april , we neglected the contribution from sn  1993j , since the supernova further faded away .",
    "we fitted the obtained seven spectra separately with the typical single component models ; the power - law , the tbs , and the mcd model .",
    "then , the mcd model turned out to be always acceptable at 90% confidence level , while the tbs model provided a worse fit except for the 1995 october and 1996 october spectra ( for the worst case , @xmath46 in 1996 april ) .",
    "the power - law fit gave the largest values of @xmath22 ( 1996 april data gave the worst fit of @xmath47 ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the spectra of m81 x-6 , like those of ic  342 source  1 , can be represented well by the single mcd model , and tabulate the mcd - fit results in table  [ tab : fit_ulxs ] .",
    "our results for the 1994 observation are consistent with those previously reported by @xcite .",
    "we plotted the obtained values of the bolometric flux of the accretion disk @xmath48 and @xmath5 in figure  [ fig : m81fxtin ] .",
    "it indicates that the seven datasets can be grossly grouped into two representative states ; a low - temperature state observed in 1995 october and 1996 april , and a high - temperature state observed on the other occasions .",
    "the low / high - temperature states correspond to the low / high - flux states , so that m81  x-6 shows similar spectral variability to ic  342 source  1 .",
    "we also present the line of @xmath49 , i.e. , the locus of @xmath10 remaining constant .",
    "although the statistical errors are somewhat large , a slight deviation from this line can be inferred .",
    "we hence made the @xmath5@xmath37 diagram in figure [ fig : m81x6 cont]a , as was done on ic  342 source  1 .",
    "thus , we again , find a hint of anti - correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath37 , like in the case of ic  342 source  1 , but relatively large errors hampers definite statement .",
    "we therefore grouped the seven datasets into two spectra , i.e. , the high - temperature state spectrum and the low - temperature state one .",
    "we fitted these two spectra by the same single component models as were used for each observation , and , again , the mcd model turned out to be the best representation of the data .",
    "we summarized the best fit parameters of the mcd model in table  [ tab : fit_ulxs ] , and plotted the @xmath5@xmath37 diagram in figure  [ fig : m81x6 cont]b , by fixing the absorption at the average value of the two states ( @xmath50  @xmath36 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath10 increases marginally as the flux decreases , although not so noticeable as in the case of ic  342 source  1 .",
    "in fact , when we fitted the two subgrouped spectra simultaneously by constraining @xmath28 and @xmath10 to be common , we obtained an acceptable fit with @xmath51=140.4/126 , while letting @xmath10 to be free does not improve the fit significantly ( @xmath51=138.0/125 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath10 is consistent with being the same between the two spectra , although a weak anti - correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath10 may be present .",
    "as previously reported by @xcite , this source showed time variability by a factor of @xmath52 between the 1993 and the 1995 observations .",
    "they analyzed both spectra with single component models ( the power - law , the tbs , and the mcd model ) , and found that the mcd one gives the best description of the data .",
    "moreover , they pointed out that the disk temperature is positively correlated with the source flux , and the value of @xmath10 seemed to increase for two years whereas the source flux decreased .",
    "this behavior is therefore similar to that found with the two sources we have described so far , and we investigate the variability of this ulx in further detail .",
    "we here utilized the same data as used by @xcite , and fitted them with the mcd model .",
    "we plot the confidence contours on the @xmath5-@xmath37 plane in figure  [ fig : n1313sb_cont_edit.eps ] , where we fixed the absorption at @xmath53  @xmath36 ( the average value between the two observations ) .",
    "like the two variable sources so far studied , a slight increase in @xmath10 can be seen as the flux decreases .",
    "the change of @xmath10 is statistically significant ( at 90% confidence ) ; we obtained an improved fit ( @xmath51=214.9/207 ) when fitting the two observations simultaneously allowing @xmath10 to take separate values , compared with that ( @xmath51=222.9/208 ) obtained when constraining @xmath10 to be common .",
    "since the source positions on the focal plane are largely separated ( @xmath54 ) between the two observations , the obtained value of @xmath10 might be affected by the response uncertainty . according to an extensive investigation utilizing the crab nebula by @xcite ,",
    "the calculated nominal source flux may increase artificially as the off - axis angle increases . as for our two observations ,",
    "source  b was observed at an off - axis angle of @xmath55 and @xmath56 in 1993 and 1995 , respectively .",
    "therefore , if this residual response uncertainty is present , the true 1993 flux should be lower than the estimated value .",
    "this would further enhance the increase in @xmath10 for two years .",
    "we therefore conclude that the change of @xmath10 seen for ngc  1313 source  b is a real effect rather than an artifact .",
    "so far , we have been investigating the time variability of ulxs spectra , and found that they can always be represented by the mcd model , event when the source flux varies significantly .",
    "we also found that the observed flux is positively correlated with @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath10 remains constant as the source flux varies like ordinary galactic / magellanic bhbs @xcite , we will have the relation of @xmath49 , whereas our ulxs show somewhat different relation ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : m81fxtin ] ) .",
    "as summarized in figure  [ fig : rin.ps ] , they seem to obey a single common scaling of @xmath38 .    the observed values of @xmath5 of our ulxs , ranging 1.02.0 kev , are also different from those of normal bhbs ( typically 0.51.2 kev ; e.g. tanaka and lewin 1995 ) .",
    "such a contradiction has been known to be a common feature of ulxs @xcite . as previously described by @xcite , in the mcd approximation for the standard accretion disk around a schwartzshild bh of mass @xmath7 , @xmath5",
    "is expressed as @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the disk bolometric luminosity normalized to the eddington luminosity , and we have been assuming @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "thus , a heavier bh should show a lower value of @xmath5 , as expressed by @xmath61 .",
    "nevertheless , the ulxs that have high luminosities and hence high bh mass actually exhibit higher disk temperatures .",
    "the upper - limit on @xmath5 inferred from equation  [ eqn : t_mass ] is 0.68  kev for the phase 1 spectra of ic342 source  1 , 1.0  kev for the high - temperature phase spectra of m81  x-6 , and 0.89  kev for the 1993 spectra of ngc  1313 source  b even assuming a face - on geometry ; these predictions contradicts the observed values by a factor of 2.9 , 1.6 , and 1.7 , respectively .",
    "a higher disk inclination angle makes the situation even worse .",
    "even if we exclude ic  342 source  1 , for which the distance to the host galaxy is somewhat uncertain , the contradiction by a factor of @xmath62 remains to be solved .",
    "thus , our research with _",
    "asca _ has provided ambivalent results on the interpretation of ulxs in terms of optically - thick standard accretion disks around massive stellar - mass bhs .",
    "on one hand , we have confirmed that the mcd model remains a good representation of the ulx spectra even when the source flux varied considerably . on the other hand ,",
    "the innermost disk radius apparently changes in an anti - correlation with the disk temperature , which makes another discrepancy in addition to the previously pointed - out problem of too - high values of @xmath5 @xcite . in order to solve these two problems",
    ", we may introduce some modification to the standard disk picture .",
    "although the standard disk model successfully explains the spectra from bhbs in the soft state , a significant progress has been achieved on the theory of accretion disks . when accretion rate @xmath63 is high and the source luminosity approaches @xmath64 , the standard disk is predicted to change into a so - called optically - thick , advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "this `` optically - thick adaf '' model @xcite is also named a `` slim accretion disk model '' , since it is moderately geometrically - thick . in ulxs , because of their high luminosities , the accretion flow configuration is expected to change from the standard disk to the slim disk .",
    "one of the most characteristic features of the slim disk , revealed by @xcite through their numerical calculations , is that the x - rays are radiated not only from the regions outside the last stable orbit , but also from the regions inside it , since an abrupt change of the radial infall velocity does no longer occur .",
    "they fitted the numerically calculated slim disk spectrum by the mcd model ( with @xmath10 and @xmath5 being the model parameters ) , and found that as @xmath63 increases , @xmath10 decreases as @xmath38 .",
    "thus , our finding of the change in @xmath10 can be explained naturally by presuming that the slim disk is realized in ulxs .",
    "this suggests the presence of a slim disk in the three ulxs studied here .    because the slim disk has a smaller @xmath10 and a higher @xmath5 than a standard disk in the same condition",
    ", it could also explain the `` too - high @xmath5 '' problem described in   4.1 .",
    "for the present three ulxs , the slim - disk scaling ( the bolometric luminosity @xmath65 ) holds over a typical range from the observed highest luminosity @xmath66 ( which we tentatively identify with @xmath64 ) down to @xmath67 .",
    "while the source luminosity varies by a factor of 2 , we expect the disk temperature to change by a factor of @xmath68 for the standard disk , or @xmath69 for the slim disk . in this way",
    ", the slim disk scenario can relax the too - high @xmath5 problem at least by a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "however , in order to fully resolve the factor @xmath71 discrepancy seen for our three ulxs , the source must make a transition from the standard - disk to slim - disk regimes at still lower luminosities , e.g. , @xmath72 .",
    "this contradicts the observed results of galactic / magellanic bhbs , where the standard accretion disk picture has been confirmed to be valid at least up to @xmath73 in case of gs  2000 + 25 and lmc  x-3 @xcite .    through the present study",
    ", we suggest that the ulxs are in the slim - disk condition because of the @xmath38 property , and that this partially explains the too - high values of @xmath5 . however , we at the same time presume that the issue can not be fully solved even assuming the slim disk hypothesis .",
    "before the present paper , some authors @xcite tried to explain the `` too - high @xmath5 '' of ulxs by assuming that the central bh is rapidly rotating ; this `` kerr - bhb hypothesis '' has first been proposed by @xcite to explain the observed high temperatures of galactic jet sources grs  1915 + 105 and gro  j1655 - 40 . in this subsection",
    ", we examine whether the remaining inconsistency seen for our ulxs can be solved by considering kerr bhs or not , taking into account the relativistic effects that have not been considered by @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we express the bh angular momentum @xmath74 in a dimensionless manner , i.e. , by a spin parameter @xmath75 .",
    "this parameter takes values between @xmath76 to @xmath77 ; @xmath78 means the extreme kerr hole for a prograde disk ( i.e. , rotating in the same direction as the bh ) , @xmath79 also represents the extreme kerr hole but for a retrograde disk , and @xmath80 corresponds , of course , to the schwarzschild bh .",
    "the most immediate effect of the bh spin is that it affects the radius of the last stable orbit , @xmath81 . while @xmath81 is @xmath82 for a schwartzshild bh , it reduces down to @xmath83 for a prograde disk around an extreme kerr hole of @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "a smaller @xmath10 leads to a higher @xmath5 , suggesting that the bh spin can explain the problem with ulxs .    neglecting relativistic effects for the moment",
    ", we can perform simple quantitative estimates . for an extremely kerr hole",
    ", @xmath10 decreases by a factor of 6 , or @xmath5 at the luminosity maximum increases by a factor of @xmath85 . even taking a somewhat less extreme case of @xmath86",
    ", we expect @xmath10 to decrease by a factor of 3 ( or , @xmath5 increases by a factor of @xmath71 ) compared to the case of a schwarzschild bh .",
    "this is apparently sufficient to explain the observed high temperatures of ulxs .    of course ,",
    "the x - ray spectra emergent from an accretion disk is subject to several relativistic corrections , due to gravitational redshift , transverse and longitudinal doppler shifts , and gravitational focusing . to a distant observer ,",
    "both the observed color temperature and flux will deviate from the local values , depending on the inclination angle @xmath87 .",
    "these effects have been examined through numerical calculations by several authors , including @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . employing the numerical calculation by @xcite , @xcite",
    "represent the relativistic effects by two correction factors , which are to be applied on the mcd modeling of the accretion disk around a kerr bh .",
    "one correction factor is the change of the color temperature denoted @xmath88 , due to the gravitational redshift and doppler red / blue - shifts .",
    "the other is the change of the flux denoted @xmath89 , due to the viewing geometry and the gravitational focusing .",
    "the observed color temperature scales as @xmath90 , whereas the observed flux scales as @xmath91 instead of @xmath92 in the newtonian case , where @xmath87 denotes the disk inclination angle .",
    "the latter correction affects the inferred upper - limit of the disk temperature as @xmath93 . further taking into account the correction due to the decrease of @xmath10 , which increases the maximum disk temperature as @xmath94 , we calculated the combined correction factor , @xmath95 , for a nearly - extreme kerr holes as shown in figure  [ fig : zhang2.ps ] .",
    "thus , if we assume a kerr bh of @xmath96=0.998 , and view the disk from an inclination angle of @xmath97 , the correction factor exceeds @xmath98 .",
    "when this is combined with another factor of @xmath99 due to the slim - disk property (   4.2 ) , we can explain the discrepancy by a factor of @xmath71 seen for ulxs .",
    "since @xmath100 is what is expected on average when the disks are randomly oriented , the chance probability of finding such objects is reasonably high .",
    "we thus conclude that the mystery of ulxs may be solved in terms of the slim accretion disk and the bh rotation .",
    "of course , there remain many aspects of the ulxs phenomena to be examined .",
    "observationally , an optical identification of the counter - part is important ; it can help us to understand how ulxs are formed , and confirm whether they are really massive , rapidly - rotating bhs",
    ". we also need to obtain spectra with much higher quality over a wider bandpass , in order to compare them with the theoretical predictions in detail .",
    "theoretically , numerical models of the x - ray spectrum emergent from an accretion disk around a kerr bh , taking into account both the relativistic and advection effects , are required .",
    "another big theoretical issue is how to make massive ( @xmath101 ) and rapidly rotating ( @xmath102 ) stellar - mass bhs .",

    "<S> using the x - ray data taken with _ asca _ , a detailed analysis was made of intensity and spectral variations of three ultra - luminous extra - galactic compact x - ray sources ( ulxs ) ; ic  342 source  1 , m81  x-6 , and ngc  1313 source  b , all exhibiting x - ray luminosity in the range @xmath0@xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as already reported , ic  342 source  1 showed short - term x - ray intensity variability by a factor of 2.0 on a typical time scale of 10  ks . </S>",
    "<S> m81  x-6 varied by a factor of 1.6 across seven observations spanning 3 years , while ngc  1313 source  b varied by a factor of 2.5 between two observations conducted in 1993 july and 1995 november . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 spectra of these sources , acquired on these occasions , were all described successfully as optically - thick emission from standard accretion disks around black holes . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms previous @xmath3 works which explained ulxs as mass - accreting massive black - hole binaries . in all three sources , </S>",
    "<S> the disk color temperature was uncomfortably high at @xmath42.0  kev , and was found to vary in proportion to the square - root of the source flux . the apparent accretion - disk radius is hence inferred to change as inversely proportional to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a significant effect of advection in the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> however , even taking this effect fully into account , the too high values of @xmath5 of ulxs can not be explained . </S>",
    "<S> further invoking the rapid black - hole rotation may give a solution to this issue . </S>"
