    "staggered fermions offer the possibility of doing unquenched calculations on current computers with far less simulation time than wilson type fermions . in their simplest form ,",
    "however , they suffer from several well - known problems which must be addressed before they can be used effectively  @xcite .",
    "one significant problem with ordinary staggered fermions is the large flavor nondegeneracy , worst in the pion sector . at tree level",
    ", it arises from transitions between doubler quarks of different flavors induced by gluons of momentum @xmath1  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , lepage showed how to turn the `` fat - link '' improvement of the milc collaboration  @xcite , which suppresses the coupling of quarks to these gluons , into a tree level @xmath2 improved action by proper tuning of the coefficients and the inclusion of an additional term .",
    "monte carlo calculations showed a large reduction in pion flavor nondegeneracy with this action  @xcite .",
    "significant flavor breaking still remains , however , so further improvement is desirable for high precision calculations . in this work ,",
    "we perform a nonperturbative determination of gluonic corrections to the tadpole improved tree level @xmath3 improved staggered action ( called the `` asqtad '' action by the milc collaboration ) .",
    "we find a small improvement in pion flavor breaking , but not the large reduction that is still desirable .",
    "therefore , incorporation of additional operators into the action is needed  @xcite .",
    "we define a modified asqtad ( masqtad ) action , built in two steps : first , from the naive fermionic action , one modifies the definition of the covariant derivative : @xmath4 \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a fat link defined as @xmath6 ( the indices in the sums are always different from @xmath7 and among each other ) .",
    "the choice of the coefficients @xmath8 corresponds to the asqtad action .",
    "second , the fermion @xmath9 is mapped into a scalar field @xmath10 by the relation @xmath11 } ( \\gamma_1^{a_1}\\gamma_2^{a_2}\\gamma_3^{a_3}\\gamma_4^{a_4})^a_\\alpha \\chi(x+a ) \\label{fermionicmap}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the spin index , @xmath13 is the flavor index , @xmath14 $ ] is a 4d hypercube .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ fermionicmap ] ) is invertible only if the fermion and the scalar live on different lattices , i.e. if the former lives on the blocked lattice of the latter  @xcite .",
    "we use this prescription to build the @xmath15-plet of pions of @xmath16 flavor .",
    "because of the remnant discrete flavor symmetry there are only seven inequivalent pions .",
    "we identify the seven inequivalent pions by their su(4 ) flavor structure @xmath17 our goal is that of tuning the coefficients @xmath18 around zero to reduce the mass splitting among these pions",
    ".    270    -1 cm",
    "our computation was performed on 113 @xmath0 improved gauge configurations at @xmath19 and @xmath20 on a @xmath21 lattice .",
    "we preceded in the following way :    we chose a finite set of points in the space of the coefficients .",
    "for each point , we performed a lattice computation of the goldstone pion and we fine tuned the quark mass @xmath22 in order to reproduce a mass for the goldstone pion , @xmath23 , equal to @xmath24 ( this is an arbitrary number ) .",
    "this fine tuning is required since the mass renormalizes in different ways for the different choices of coefficients and we need to impose a physical renormalization condition .",
    "then , for each point , we computed the whole spectrum of pions using the corresponding fine tuned value for the quark mass .",
    "we chose 91 points in the space of coefficients , namely @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 for every value of @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "these points are represented in fig .",
    "[ 5dcube ] .",
    "this choice enables us to evaluate numerically the first ( @xmath31 ) and second derivative ( @xmath32 ) of the pion masses in respect to each coefficient of the action ( keeping fixed the renormalization condition , i.e. the mass of the goldstone pion ) .",
    "this work amounts to more than 10000 fermionic inversions of the action and more than 2000 fits of pion propagators ; it was performed on the fermilab qcd80 cluster .",
    "we expand the pion masses as functions of the coefficients in the action , in taylor series up to second order @xmath33 and we define @xmath34 where @xmath35 because of our choice of renormalization condition . in fig .",
    "[ plotall ] we report sections of the function @xmath36 . each plot shows the value of @xmath37 of all pions , @xmath38 , when we vary one single coefficient .",
    "the first result that is already visible from the plots is that the spectrum is very mildly dependent on the action and there is no obvious direction in the space of coefficients where the pion mass splitting gets reduced for all pions at once .",
    "one should notice that the signs of the first derivatives are consistent for the different pions , but they are very small .",
    "they are of the same order of magnitude as the error on @xmath42 .",
    "this means that within a more than reasonable range ( @xmath43 $ ] ) the pion s splitting does not vary more than @xmath44 where @xmath45 is its statistical error .",
    "we conclude that the flavor nondegeneracy of the tadpole improved tree level improved staggered action may be somewhat improved by a nonperturbative tuning of the coefficients , by perhaps @xmath46 or less .",
    "however , for further dramatic reduction in flavor breaking , new terms must be added to the action , as in ref .",
