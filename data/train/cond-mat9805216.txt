    "the pioneering experiment of bayfield and koch performed in 1974 @xcite attracted a great interest to ionization of highly excited hydrogen and rydberg atoms in a microwave field @xcite .",
    "the main reason of this interest is due to the fact that such ionization requires the absorption of a large number of photons ( about @xmath0 ) and can be explained only as a result of the appearence of dynamical chaos and diffusive energy excitation in the corresponding classical system .",
    "indeed the critical border @xmath1 for the microwave field intensity above which classical chaotic motion takes place is given by @xcite : @xmath2 here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the microwave field strength and frequency , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the rescaled values , and @xmath7 is the initial unperturbed energy of the atom ( see rescaling details below ; atomic units are used ) .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath8 and that the initial orbital momentum @xmath9 . for @xmath10",
    "the electron energy @xmath11 only performs small oscillations around its initial value and therefore ionization is impossible in the classical system . above the chaos border instead , the electron s energy increases in a diffusive way with a diffusion rate per unit time given by @xcite : @xmath12 this diffusion leads to electron s ionization after a typical diffusive time scale @xmath13 , with @xmath7 being the initial energy .",
    "such classical diffusive ionization requires many microwave periods ( @xmath14 ) and quantum interference effects can suppress this diffusion leading to quantum localization of chaos @xcite .",
    "such dynamical localization of chaos leads to a quantum probability distribution @xmath15 exponentially localized in the number of absorbed photons @xmath16 , namely @xmath17 . for the general case of monochromatic field excitation in a complex spectrum the localization length @xmath18 , measured in the number of photons ,",
    "can be determined via the one - photon transition rate @xmath19 and the density of coupled states @xmath20 @xcite : @xmath21 the last equality in the above equation corresponds to the hydrogen case , where @xmath22 due to coulomb degeneracy ( which , as is known , is responsible for the appearence of an additional integral on motion @xcite ) .",
    "quite obviously , in case of strong localization , namely when the localization length is less than the number of photons required for ionization , @xmath23 , the quantum ionization is exponentially small and therefore negligible compared to its classical value .",
    "in the opposite case @xmath24 , namely above the quantum delocalization border @xmath25 @xmath26 quantum ionization takes place in close to the classical case @xcite .",
    "we note that the above dynamical localization represents a deterministic analog of the anderson localization in disordered quasi ",
    "one  dimensional chains . in our case",
    "the site index corresponds to the photon number @xmath27 , while @xmath28 plays the role of the effective sample size .",
    "the above theoretical results have been checked by different groups @xcite and more recently reconfirmed in numerical simulations with newly developed algorithms @xcite .",
    "the predictions of dynamical localization have been also confirmed by laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "however , in the mesoscopic solid - state language , the effective `` sample size '' available in these experiments , corresponding to @xmath29 was too short to test with sufficient accuracy the theoretical predictions .",
    "in fact in this situation one observes significant mesoscopic fluctuations in the ionization border which have been discussed in detail in @xcite . while the main structure of these mesoscopic fluctuations can be well described by the quantum kepler map @xcite it is still highly desirable to have much longer `` samples '' with @xmath30 to study experimentally the dynamical localization of chaos in more detail .",
    "we note that recently the dynamical localization has been also observed in experiments with cold atoms propagation @xcite ; however , in this situation there are other experimental restrictions .    in order to have larger @xmath28 values ,",
    "one has , either to increase @xmath31 or to take @xmath32 .",
    "however , the first possibility is restricted by experimental conditions where one prefers to have @xmath33 . the second choice leads to a regime close to the static field ionization in which no classical chaos exists ; in any case , localization of classically chaotic motion does not take place for @xmath34 . in order to actually have large @xmath28 values",
    ", it is necessary to take a different approach and work with atoms which are classically chaotic already in the absence of the microwave field .",
    "there are two main possibilities to have chaotic rydberg atoms .",
    "one way is to put hydrogen or rydberg atoms in a magnetic field . in this case , the classical dynamics becomes chaotic when the larmor frequency is comparable with the unperturbed kepler frequency @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to use rydberg atoms with quantum defects in a static electric field .",
    "recent investigations have shown that for a sufficiently strong static field the level spacing statistics is similar to the case of random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite . from the experimental viewpoint",
    "the case with a static electric field is simpler to deal with and in fact can be studied in laboratory experiments similar to @xcite .",
    "for such atoms the chaos border for the microwave field drops to zero and therefore even at very small microwave field one can expect to see diffusive excitation in energy .",
    "in addition , such a diffusion can take place for much lower frequencies with @xmath35 , and this fact allows to increase the values of @xmath28 up to few thousands .",
    "the investigation of the interaction of chaotic rydberg atoms with a microwave radiation is also interesting from another viewpoint .",
    "indeed , it is known that a chaotic structure of eigenstates leads to a strong enhancement of the interaction .",
    "in nuclear physics , as was shown by sushkov and flambaum @xcite , this effect leads to an enhancement of weak interaction and parity violation by a factor of thousand or more .",
    "also in the problem of anderson localization in disordered solid  state systems it has been found that a short range repulsive / attractive interaction between two particles can strongly enhance their propagation @xcite .",
    "all this indicates that a chaotic structure of rydberg atoms can strongly increase their interaction with radiation .",
    "this should lead to a significant decrease of the quantum delocalization border as compared to the standard case of internally non - chaotic atoms studied in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the experiments by gallagher _ et al . _",
    "@xcite indicated a lower ionization border than for the hydrogen case @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism of such ionization , proposed by gallagher _",
    "@xcite , is based on a picture of successive landau - zener crossings in a slowly oscillating microwave field .",
    "however , the question how such transitions can proceed to high levels was never studied in detail . moreover , for @xmath36 one enters in a multiphoton regime which was not discussed in @xcite .",
    "due to the above reasons , the investigation of chaotic enhancement of microwave ionization of rydberg atoms allows to address a new physical regime in which thousands of photons are required to ionize one atom .",
    "our theoretical and numerical results indeed clearly demostrate the existence of such enhancement and provide a clear physical picture of the ionization process . in section ii we discuss the case of atoms in parallel magnetic and microwave fields , while the case of rydberg atoms in static and microwave fields is analysed in section iii .",
    "the main results are discussed in section iv .",
    "some results have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a hydrogen atom in parallel microwave and uniform magnetic fields writes @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the direction of the fields , @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath41 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the microwave strength and frequency respectively ( atomic units are used ) . due to the cylindrical symmetry , the @xmath38 component of the angular momentum @xmath42 is a constant of the motion and here we consider @xmath43 .",
    "the above hamiltonian , expressed as a function of cartesian coordinates @xmath44 , their conjugate momenta @xmath45 , the time @xmath46 and the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath47 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 has the property @xmath48 if we choose @xmath49 , with @xmath50 the initial energy , the classical dynamics depends on @xmath31 only via the scaled variables @xcite @xmath51 the coordinates and momenta scale as @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the rescaled time @xmath54 , up to a factor of @xmath55 , counts the number of kepler periods in the electron motion in the absence of external fields ( @xmath56 ) .    in order to study the dynamics of the time ",
    "dependent hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) , it is possible to introduce an extended phase space in which the hamiltonian becomes conservative with respect to a fictitious time @xmath57 .",
    "the new hamiltonian writes @xmath58 , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 as new classical conjugate variables .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath61 and @xmath60 are given by @xmath62 notice that @xmath57 is equal to the scaled time @xmath63 up to an additive constant , and therefore the ordinary hamilton s equations follow for the other canonical variables . since @xmath64 is a constant of motion , in the quantum case",
    "the change of @xmath60 would give , apart from a @xmath65 scaling factor , the number of photons @xmath66 exchanged by the atom with the field @xcite : @xmath67 .",
    "the singularity of the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) at @xmath68 can be removed by introducing the semi ",
    "parabolic coordinates @xmath69 , @xmath70 and the regularized time @xmath71 , defined as @xcite @xmath72 which changes faster than @xmath63 near the nucleus and more slowly far from it .",
    "the equations of motion generated by the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) are then equivalent to the equations of motion generated , with respect to the new time @xmath71 , by the scaled and regularized hamiltonian @xmath73 indeed , for any classical quantity @xmath74 , we get @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the poisson bracket between @xmath64 and @xmath77 . thus , if we take @xmath78 as initial condition for @xmath60 , the compensated energy @xmath64 is equal to zero and we obtain @xmath79 that is @xmath80 works as an effective hamiltonian for the time @xmath71 .",
    "for @xmath43 we have @xmath81 for @xmath82 , @xmath83 and therefore the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) represents two harmonic oscillators of unit frequency coupled by the term @xmath84 which originates from the diamagnetic interaction . for low",
    "scaled magnetic field @xmath85 , the motion is regular and the orbits are quasiperiodic .",
    "however , the diamagnetic term has cylindrical symmetry since it depends only on the perpendicular distance @xmath86 from the magnetic field axis . on the contrary ,",
    "the coulomb term has spherical symmetry .",
    "when these two terms are of comparable magnitude , @xmath87 ( that gives @xmath85 of the order of unity ) , then the competition between different symmetries leads to chaotic motion @xcite . in fig.[fig1 ] the classical phase space structure is illustrated by the poincar surfaces of section . for @xmath88 some islands of stability still exist but their size is small , while for @xmath89 no regular structures are visible and the classical motion is dominated by global chaos @xcite .    due to this internal chaos , the turn on of the microwave field immediately leads to diffusive energy excitation of the electron , with classical diffusion rate per unit time @xmath90 . from eq.([ham1 ] ) @xmath91 , with the typical frequencies for the @xmath38 motion of the order of the kepler frequency @xmath92 ( for @xmath85 not too large with respect to @xmath93 ) . for @xmath94 ,",
    "@xmath95 can be estimated in quasilinear approximation @xcite , giving @xmath96 and then @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a constant to be numerically determined and @xmath99 is the diffusion rate for @xmath100 and @xmath101 when the microwave intensity is strong enough to induce chaos @xcite .    for @xmath102 , in analogy with the case without magnetic field ,",
    "the microwave interaction is mainly effective when the electron passes close to the nucleus , where the coulomb term dominates the diamagnetic term , and therefore , as for the case @xmath100 , one has @xcite : @xmath103 with a constant @xmath104 again to be numerically determined .",
    "an example of diffusive energy excitation , for scaled frequency @xmath94 , is shown in fig.[fig2 ] . here @xmath88 , so that the motion is chaotic even in the absence of the microwave and therefore a diffusive process occurs even if the microwave intensity is very small .",
    "the frequency dependence of the diffusion rate @xmath95 is shown in fig.[fig3 ] , for @xmath88 and @xmath105 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviors ( both for small and large frequencies ) are in agreement with the theoretical estimates ( [ diff1 ] ) and ( [ diff2 ] ) respectively , indicated in the figure by the straight lines , with the coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath104 numerically determined .",
    "these coefficients depend weakly on @xmath47 , for magnetic field strong enough to induce internal chaos ( @xmath106 ) . below this value",
    "the internal motion becomes integrable and for low enough @xmath107 diffusion drops to zero , as demonstrated in the insert of fig.[fig3 ] ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the classical diffusive process will lead the electron to ionization in a time @xmath108 , with @xmath109 the initial electron energy . in the quantum case , for @xmath110",
    "the time evolution initially follows the classical diffusion .",
    "the excitation proceeds via a chain of one  photon transitions , which eventually brings the electron into continuum .",
    "however , if the ionization time is sufficiently large , quantum interference effects may suppress the diffusive excitation leading to dynamical localization in the number of photons .    in order to check this possibility we numerically analyzed the quantum dynamics @xcite , following the wave packet evolution in the eigenstates basis of the magnetic field problem with @xmath82 .    to obtain these eigenstates at @xmath82 in a given energy window around the initially excited level with eigenenergy @xmath111 , we diagonalized the hamiltonian in a parabolic sturmian basis @xcite .",
    "this basis is well suited since it is complete and discrete and can efficiently reproduce both the bound and continuum states of the hydrogen atom .",
    "in addition , all the hamiltonian matrix elements can be expressed in a simple analytical form and strong selection rules exist for the parabolic quantum numbers @xmath112 , @xmath113 ( @xmath114 for @xmath115 ) .",
    "a minor disadvantage of dealing with a sturmian basis is associated with its nonorthogonality . due to this fact",
    ", we had to solve a generalized eigenvalue problem of the type @xmath116 , where also the overlap matrix @xmath117 has strong selection rules ( @xmath118 for @xmath115 ) .",
    "as a result the matrices @xmath119 and @xmath117 are very sparse . to study the time evolution we used up to @xmath120 eigenstates of the above generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "in order to obtain a good convergence of these @xmath120 eigenvectors and eigenvalues we had to diagonalize matrices of size larger than @xmath121 . for these reasons",
    "the use of an efficient lanczos algorithm @xcite has been crucial .",
    "the time evolution was computed by a split ",
    "step metod , similar to the one used in @xcite .    in our computations",
    ", we considered as initial state an eigenstate at @xmath82 with eigenenergy @xmath122 and the time evolution in the microwave field was followed up to @xmath123 microwave periods .",
    "the parameters were varied in the intervals @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , for @xmath88 and @xmath105 .    in this quasiclassical regime the quantum energy excitation has initially a diffusive character ( see the insert of fig.[fig4 ] ) and therefore it is possible to compute a quantum diffusion coefficient @xmath127 from a linear fit , for the few first microwave periods , of the wave packet energy square variance @xmath128 vs. time .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows that quantum and classical diffusion coefficients are similar over a wide range of frequencies ( @xmath129 for @xmath130 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that quantum dynamics mimics , for a finite interaction time , the classical excitation .    in the quasiclassical regime",
    ", the one  photon transition rate @xmath131 can be related to the classical diffusion rate @xcite as @xmath132 . indeed",
    "the change in energy produced by a one  photon transition is @xmath133 and @xmath131 measures the number of such transitions per unit time .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the transition rate for the chaotic case at @xmath100 and @xmath101 , is equal to @xmath136 this result is remarkable as it relates the quantum transition rate to a classical characteristic of motion , namely the diffusion coefficient . in order to check the above estimate ,",
    "@xmath131 was numerically evaluated according to fermi s golden rule : @xmath137 with @xmath138 matrix elements of @xmath38 between the eigenstates at @xmath82 with eigenenergies @xmath139 . for the numerical computation , the dirac delta function in eq.([gamma ] )",
    "was substituted by a lorentzian function : @xmath140 , with @xmath141 of the order of the level spacing .",
    "the validity of the classical  quantum correspondence ( [ gammacq ] ) is confirmed in fig.[fig5 ] , for @xmath142 and @xmath129 .",
    "even if initially the interaction with the microwave field results in a quantum diffusive excitation , quantum interference effects can suppress the diffusive behavior before ionization takes place . in this case , the diffusive broadening of the quantum probability distribution over unperturbed levels stops .",
    "the corresponding localization length ( measured in number of absorbed photons ) @xmath143 is proportional to the one  photon transition rate @xmath131 and to the density of coupled states @xmath144 : @xmath145 @xcite . for the chaotic case at @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "the localization length is @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the density of coupled states @xcite .",
    "actually , without the magnetic field there is an additional approximate integral of motion , related to coulomb degeneracy , and therefore the density of coupled states @xmath148 is by a factor @xmath31 smaller than the number of levels per unit energy interval @xmath149 @xcite . therefore from the above expressions and eq.([gammacq ] ) we get @xcite @xmath150 this result provides a theoretical formula for the the quatum localization length , which involves only classical characteristics of motion , namely the classical diffusion coefficient and the density of coupled states .",
    "the latter is related , in the quasiclassical regime , to the phase space structure ( see below eqs.([volume])([density ] ) ) .",
    "the estimate ( [ locb ] ) is valid for @xmath151 , namely in the quasiclassical regime , in which a large number of photons is absorbed and a large number of levels is excited .",
    "moreover , the microwave frequency should be larger than the average level spacing ( @xmath152 ) ; otherwise , levels would move adiabatically in time leaving no room for diffusive energy growth @xcite .    for @xmath85",
    "sufficiently large , the internal motion is chaotic : as a consequence , coulomb degeneracy is removed and the density of coupled states @xmath153 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath154 ( for @xmath88 , @xmath130 ) and @xmath155 ( for @xmath89 , @xmath130 ) ( see fig.[fig6 ] ) .",
    "the density follows the dependence @xmath156 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the diamagnetic term is identical to a two  dimensional harmonic oscillator in the @xmath157 plane .",
    "indeed for a harmonic oscillator the spacing between levels is proportional to the frequency ( here represented by @xmath47 ) and therefore their density scales with @xmath158 .",
    "this result is confirmed by a quasiclassical computation of the density of states ( see the insert of fig.[fig6 ] ) . here",
    "the number @xmath159 of quantum states having energy less than @xmath11 is related to the corresponding volume in phase space @xmath160 where the hamiltonian @xmath119 is taken at @xmath82 .",
    "the density of states is @xmath161 where the volume in the scaled phase space is defined as @xmath162 with @xmath163 according to the results of fig.[fig6 ] such semiclassically determined density of states is in a good agreement with the results obtained by direct diagonalization of hydrogen in magnetic field .",
    "according to the estimate ( [ locb ] ) and differently from the zero magnetic field case , the localization length @xmath143 is non homogeneous in the number @xmath27 of absorbed photons .",
    "indeed , from equations ( [ diff1 ] ) and ( [ diff2 ] ) we get @xmath164 for @xmath94 and @xmath165 for @xmath166 @xcite , with @xmath167 the number of photons required for ionization and @xmath168 , where @xmath169 .",
    "however , for @xmath170 this effect is not important and the quasistationary distribution is exponentially localized in the photon number @xmath27 . as for the case of hydrogen in a microwave field only @xcite , the probability distribution over unperturbed levels ( @xmath82 ) displays a chain of equidistant peaks in energy .",
    "the probability amplitudes in a one  photon interval decay esponentially with the photon number : @xmath171 .",
    "the value of the localization length @xmath143 is strongly enhanced compared to the length @xmath172 @xcite at @xmath100 and @xmath173 .",
    "actually , for a strong enough scaled magnetic field , coulomb degeneracy is removed and the eigenfunctions @xmath174 , when developed on the basis of the hydrogenic eigenfunctions @xmath175 , have a large number of randomly fluctuating components , increased by a factor @xmath176 : @xmath177 with @xmath178 due to normalization condition . because of this , the external microwave perturbation @xmath179 couples the eigenstates with typical interaction matrix elements @xmath180 due to selection rules for @xmath179 in the hydrogenic basis , @xmath181 is the sum of order @xmath182 uncorrelated terms and is therefore reduced by a factor @xmath183 in comparison with the case without magnetic field , whereas the spacing @xmath184 between nearest neighbors levels in the spectrum scales as @xmath185 .",
    "thus , the admixture factor @xmath186 is strongly enhanced , for high @xmath31 values , in comparison with the zero magnetic field case . as a result",
    ", the localization length @xmath143 , which is proportional to @xmath187 , is increased @xcite by a factor @xmath188 a similar effect was discussed for two interacting particles in a disordered solid state system @xcite : the interaction allows the two particles to propagate coherently on a distance much larger than one  particle localization length .",
    "the statistical enhancement effect is quite general and takes place in different pysical problems : actually this effect was first studied for the weak interaction parity  breaking in the scattering of polarized neutrons on complex nuclei @xcite . in the compound nucleus the level spacing is typically @xmath189 ev , whereas the typical energy scale due to the strong interaction is @xmath190 mev . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of principal components of the eigenfunctions in the one - particle basis is @xmath191 and therefore the admixture factor between states of opposite parity is enhanced by a factor @xmath192 compared to a usual parity breaking admixture of the order @xmath193 .    the condition @xmath194 allows to determine the quantum delocalization border @xcite : @xmath195 for @xmath196 localization effects become unimportant and diffusive ionization close to the classical case takes place . for @xmath166",
    "this border is @xmath197 times smaller than the quantum delocalization border at zero magnetic field @xcite @xmath198 . for @xmath94 the border",
    "is given by @xmath199 , which remains well below the ionization border for a static electric field in the presence of a parallel magnetic field .",
    "since the localization length is non homogeneous in the number of absorbed photons and becomes larger near the ionization border , the actual value of the delocalization border @xmath200 will be slightly decreased as compared to ( [ deloc ] ) .",
    "the above dynamical localization theory was tested by detailed numerical simulations of quantum evolution .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath201 over the eigenstates at @xmath82 for the localized case is shown in figs.[fig7],[fig8 ] as a function of the number of absorbed photons @xmath202 . in order to suppress fluctuactions this probability",
    "was averaged over @xmath203 microwave periods . to find the numerical value @xmath204 of the localization length we first computed the probability @xmath15 in each one",
    " photon interval around integer values of @xmath27 .",
    "then the least square fit with @xmath205 for @xmath206 allows to determine @xmath204 . the quantum distribution at @xmath207 ( fig.[fig8](b ) )",
    "starts to deviate from the exponential profile for @xmath208 and a plateau appears .",
    "this can be related to the fact that localization length is non homogeneous in the number of absorbed photons ( @xmath209 for @xmath94 ) . in the figures also",
    "the classical distribution , normalized to one  photon interval , is shown .",
    "this distribution was obtained by numerical solution of hamilton equations with @xmath210 trajectories initially distributed microcanonically on the energy surface at energy @xmath211 .",
    "the comparison of the probability distributions at different times ( @xmath212 in figs.[fig7](a),[fig8](a ) and @xmath213 in figs.[fig7](b),[fig8](b ) ) shows that the quantum case is well localized over a quasistationary distribution .",
    "its profile does not change significantly by increasing the interaction time , apart from a slight increase in the tail .",
    "we attribute the decrease in the probability decay at large @xmath214 to the growth of the diffusion rate @xmath95 when @xmath215 approaches @xmath93 from below ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .    these distributions , together with the time dependence of the square variance of the photon number @xmath216 ( see fig.[fig9 ] )",
    "demonstrate how the quantum  mechanical energy diffusion is strongly suppressed in comparison with the classical case .",
    "the numerically obtained localization lengths @xmath204 are presented fig.[fig10 ] , for two fixed values of @xmath107 and different @xmath215 in the range @xmath129 . since @xmath130",

    "the straight line , corresponding to @xmath219 , demonstrates the fairly good agreement between numerical data and dynamical localization theory over a wide range of parameters ( the localization length changes by two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "finally , figs.[fig11],[fig12 ] show that the excitation at @xmath88 is much stronger than at zero magnetic field , due to the chaotic enhancement of electron s interaction with the microwave field . since the condition for the transition to chaotic dynamics at zero magnetic field is given by @xcite @xmath220 , the case of fig.[fig11 ] ( that corresponds to fig.10 in @xcite )",
    "is above the chaos threshold ( @xmath221 ) .",
    "however the quantum distribution at @xmath100 clearly demonstrates exponential localization of diffusive excitation since @xmath222 . on the contrary , for @xmath88 we are above the delocalization border ( @xmath223 ) and",
    "thus numerical results show a good agreement between classical and quantum distributions .",
    "the quantum and classical square variance of the photon number are shown in fig.[fig12 ] . in the absence of the magnetic field ,",
    "the localization of the quantum motion after a few microwave periods is evident ; on the contrary , for @xmath88 the quantum square variance follows the classical one and starts to deviate only for @xmath224 because of the finite size of the basis .",
    "another way to study the microwave interaction in an intrinsically chaotic atomic system is to consider alkali rydberg atoms in a static electric field ; this case is interesting as it is more suitable for laboratory experiments .",
    "the hamiltonian of a hydrogen atom in a static electric field is separable in parabolic coordinates and thus the classical motion is integrable . on the contrary , in alkali atoms",
    "the valence electron moves in an attractive potential in which the @xmath225 dependence is modified near the origin due to the charge distribution of the inner electrons , which form a core of size a few bohr radius .",
    "due to precession in a static electric field , the electron always collides with the core .",
    "this fact prevents the separation of variables and the motion becomes chaotic for certain field and energy values @xcite .",

    ", the chaotic motion arises from the presence of a core , which is small compared to the typical size of rydberg atoms .",

    "the energy levels for alkali atoms in a static electric field ( the so  called stark levels ) were obtained by matrix diagonalization in a spherical hydrogenic basis ; quantum defects were introduced simply in the alkali energy levels ( for angular momentum @xmath241 ) , while dipole matrix elements were taken as in the hydrogen case .",
    "this approach is valid outside the ionic core , where @xmath276 is essentially hydrogenic and so is particularly well suited for rydberg states , in which the electron mainly remains far from the nucleus .",
    "the off  diagonal dipole matrix elements for the @xmath38 operator decrease rapidly with the difference in energy between initial and final states . as a result",
    ", stark eigenvalues and eigenvectors in a given energy window can be obtained by diagonalization of hamiltonian matrices of limited size around this region .",
    "a limitation of the method is that only bound states are included in the basis set and increasingly large matrices must be used to obtain convergence as the static field ionization border @xmath277 is approached",

    "more and more shells are mixed moving to the saddle point @xmath285 and chaotic properties become stronger . for @xmath274 , @xmath130 , @xmath286 and",

    "when the microwave field is turned on , the internal chaos leads to diffusive energy excitation in the classical dynamics , with energy diffusion rate per unit time @xmath287 . as for the hydrogen atom in static electric and microwave fields ,",
    "the rate @xmath288 can be compared with the diffusion rate @xmath289 for hydrogen with only the microwave field present and at @xmath101 .",
    "again the asymptotic behaviors @xmath290 ( for @xmath94 ) and @xmath291 ( for @xmath166 ) are expected .",
    "this is confirmed by fig.[fig16 ] , that shows the frequency dependence of the scaled diffusion rate @xmath292 for rb , na and li at @xmath274 , @xmath293 , @xmath130 .",
    "the core potential parameters @xmath228 are not changed with the initial level @xmath31 . as a result ,",
    "the dependence on the initial energy or on @xmath31 can no longer be eliminated by classical rescaling .",
    "however the classical scaling rule remains a useful approximation since @xmath292 varies very slowly with @xmath31 for rydberg atoms ( for rb at @xmath274 , @xmath293 , @xmath294 , @xmath292 remains between @xmath295 and @xmath296 for @xmath297 ) .",
    "this fact can be understood by taking into account that only for low @xmath240 values the electron collides with the core .",
    "the energy diffusion rate is therefore determined by the frequency of these collisions , which is determined by the frequency of classical precession in @xmath240 , namely by the scaled stark frequency @xmath298 , independently from @xmath31 . in other words ,",
    "the dimensions of the core play no important rle for the classical diffusion rate .",
    "fig.[fig16 ] presents some other interesting features : a sharp resonant peak for @xmath101 and a plateau for @xmath299 .",
    "this latter characteristic is due to the fact that core collisions , that are responsible for energy diffusion , occur at the stark frequency @xmath300 , independently from @xmath215 .",
    "this fact is also illustrated in the insert of fig.[fig16 ] : for very low microwave intensity ( @xmath301 ) and for @xmath294 the diffusion coefficient grows with the static field @xmath265 , while for @xmath293 , when @xmath302 , the microwave field dominates the angular momentum precession and the dependence of @xmath292 on @xmath265 becomes rather weak .",
    "the peak at @xmath101 in fig.[fig16 ] is due to the resonance between kepler and microwave frequency .",
    "fig.[fig17 ] shows that the diffusion rate drops abruptly as the electron goes out of the resonance ( for @xmath293 this happens after approximately @xmath303 microwave periods ) .",
    "such sharp change of the diffusion rate was observed only near the main resonance @xmath101 , while for other integer values of @xmath215 our studies did not indicate any sharp change .    to study diffusion in the quantum case we considered the initial wavefunction at @xmath304 as an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ hamqdef ] ) at @xmath82 with eigenenergy @xmath122 @xcite . as in the case of the hydrogen atom in magnetic and microwave fields , the quantum dynamics",
    "was followed by a split - step method , similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "the quantum diffusion rate @xmath305 was obtained by a linear fit of the energy square variance @xmath128 vs. time for the first few microwave periods .",
    "the classical  quantum comparison for the scaled diffusion coefficients @xmath292 and @xmath306 ( see fig.[fig18 ] ) shows a quantitative difference .",
    "this is due to the fact that only low angular momentum values contribute to the diffusion and so purely quantum effects can be expected .",
    "in addition , the influence of the ionic core is stronger in classical mechanics because trajectories can penetrate in arbitrarily small regions in the phase space .",
    "on the contrary , quantum mechanics tends to smooth over such regions .",
    "apparently this is the reason for which classical diffusion rate is sistematically larger than the corresponding quantum value .    due to quantum interference effects",
    ", the above diffusive excitation may eventually stop before ionization .",
    "the resulting quasistationary distribution is characterized by an exponential decay in the number of absorbed photons , with a localization length @xmath307 proportional to the one  photon transition rate @xmath308 and to the density of coupled states @xmath20 : @xmath309 @xcite .",
    "the rate is given by @xmath310 and since the internal motion is chaotic the density of coupled states is @xmath311 .",
    "this leads to @xcite : @xmath312 where , as in eq.([locb ] ) , @xmath313 and the conditions @xmath314 , @xmath315 must be satisfied .    in order to check the theoretical prediction ( [ locqdef ] ) ,",

    "the numerical localization length @xmath323 agrees with the theoretical @xmath307 value ( eq.([locqdef ] ) ) for @xmath293 .",
    "the figure also shows how quantum excitation is strongly suppressed in comparison with the classical case .",
    "for a smaller microwave intensity ( @xmath325 ) the fit in the interval @xmath326 gives @xmath327 , whereas the fit for the tail ( @xmath328 ) shows a much slower decay , with @xmath329 .",
    "we checked that this slope change is not affected by the variation of the basis size and integration step .",
    "this change in the probability decay at large @xmath27 can be attributed to a significant change in the eigenstate structure in a static electric field when one approaches the saddle point behind which tunneling takes place . indeed according to the results shown in fig.[fig15 ] a stark eigenstates for higly excited levels projects on a larger number of hydrogenic levels .",
    "additional investigations are required for a better understanding of this effect .",

    "one can see that the quantum delocalization border is approximaely @xmath341 ( see fig.6 in @xcite ) .",
    "the ionization process was interpreted by gallagher _",

    "zener theory does not apply if the microwave frequency is larger than the typical spacing between levels , namely for @xmath345 .",
    "on the contrary , the dynamical localization theory allows to understand ionization of atoms in a static electric field for the non  adiabatic regime @xmath345 .",
    "according to this theory the mechanism of ionization is qualitatively different from the one proposed by gallagher _",
    ", namely ionization takes place due to diffusive excitation in energy originated by internal chaos existing in absence of the microwave field .",
    "a difficulty for the direct comparison with experiments @xcite is that only few of them were done in the presence of a a static electric field @xcite and , in addition , they were in the regime @xmath346 .",
    "however , there is a case for na at @xmath347 , initial orbital momentum @xmath348 , @xmath349 , @xmath350 ( fig.2d in @xcite ) which is not far from our conditions ( @xmath351 ) .",
    "the experimental @xmath352 ionization threshold is @xmath353 .",
    "this value is about @xmath203 times smaller than the quantum delocalization border given by eq.([delocqdef ] ) with @xmath354 . indeed ,",
    "quantum simulations in the eigenstate basis , extended up to @xmath317 periods ( see fig.[fig22 ] ) , give a localization length @xmath355 .",
    "we understand this discrepancy as due to deviations in the tail of probability distribution ( @xmath356 for @xmath357 ) similarly to the case discussed in fig.[fig19 ] .    in order to support this interpretation , we followed the time evolution in the hydrogenic basis and simulated tunneling ionization by an absorption mechanism .",
    "namely , we modified the evolution of the wave function @xmath358 as @xmath359 where @xmath360 is time ordering operator , @xmath361 is a diagonal operator in the spherical basis , with matrix elements @xmath362 for all the states in a shell with principal quantum number @xmath363 ( @xmath364 ) . in this way , there is absorption for levels above the static field ionization threshold after a time approximately equal to the kepler period @xmath365 . in this model , ionization probability grows with time in a nearly linear way ( see fig.[fig23 ] ) , with ionization rate ( per microwave period ) @xmath366 .",
    "this fact can become important for very long interaction times ( @xmath367 microwave periods in @xcite ) leading to strong ionization .",
    "another situation in which the experimental ionization border is much lower than the one given by the theoretical estimate ( [ delocqdef ] ) was observed in beterov _",
    "_ experiments @xcite . in this experiments , with @xmath368 , @xmath369 , @xmath370 , @xmath371 , approximately half of na atoms were ionized after @xmath372 microwave periods at @xmath373 .",
    "a static field of strength @xmath274 would give a diffusion rate @xmath374 .",
    "in such a case the quantum delocalization border is @xmath375 which is much higher than the experimental value .",
    "the numerical simulations with effective absorption discussed above give an absorption rate @xmath376 for @xmath373 and @xmath377 .",
    "such ionization rate would give a significant ionization during the long interaction time @xmath378 used in experiments @xcite .    a possibility",
    ", alternative to the presence of a weak static electric field , is that some noise existing in the waveguide could destroy localization and give a larger ionization probability compared to the theoretical explanation ( [ delocqdef ] ) .    for @xmath94",
    ", one could expect that the slowly varying microwave field will also play the rle of a static electric field even if @xmath379 .",
    "however , in reality , this expectation can be valid only if @xmath215 is much smaller than the frequency @xmath300 of classical precession determined by the stark splitting and equal to @xmath380 ( @xmath381 ) .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied then the mixing of @xmath240 states will not take place and this is in agreement with our numerical data for rb at @xmath130 , @xmath382 , @xmath294 , @xmath383 , @xmath371 , where after @xmath384 microwave periods only few @xmath240states are mixed ( @xmath385 ) . at the same time in a presence of a static field",

    "the localization in @xmath240 space for rb atoms was found also in @xcite at @xmath379 .",
    "the existing experiments does not allow unfortunately to make a direct check of dynamical localization theory because the interaction times were too long and therefore it is difficult to control the effect of environment .",
    "however present laboratory conditions allow to study short interaction times ( @xmath387 ) and high quantum numbers @xmath388 . in these conditions , according to our numerical and theoretical results , quantum excitation of atoms is well described by the dynamical localization theory .",
    "experiments in this regime will allow to test the quantum localization effects in a range of parameters much larger than it was so far possible .",
    "additional investigations should be done for the regime @xmath173 . in this case",
    "the electron precess with very low frequency @xmath389 and therefore the static electric field gives an adiabatic perturbation on the localized distribution in the photon number .",
    "the case of such adiabatic destruction of the localized case was discussed in @xcite and manifestations of this effect for alkali rydberg atoms should be analyzed more carefully .",
    "the situation for alkali rydberg atoms in a static electric field is quite different from the case of the hydrogen atom in magnetic and microwave fields , where for @xmath173 the microwave frequency is of the order of the larmor frequency ( @xmath390 ) . on the contrary , for alkali atoms @xmath389 and",
    "therefore localization takes place faster than the spreading of the wave function over the whole energy surface .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the properties of microwave ionization of chaotic rydberg atoms .",
    "similar to the cases of parity violation in nuclei @xcite and of two interacting particles effect in disordered systems @xcite , a chaotic structure of eigenstates ( in absence of microwave ) leads to a chaotic enhancement of radiation interaction with atoms . as a result the localization length in the number of photons is strongly increased as compared to the usual situation in which the internal dynamics of the atom , without the microwave field , is integrable @xcite ; as a consequence , the quantum delocalization border drops down significantly .",
    "the theory of dynamical localization developed for such chaotic atoms is in good agreement with the results of extensive numerical simulations .",
    "investigations of such atoms in laboratory experiments represent a new important opportunity to provide detailed results for quantum chaos and dynamical localization . indeed , due to internal chaos",
    ", the excitation proceeds in a diffusive way even if the microwave frequency is much smaller than the kepler frequency of electron s rotation ( @xmath32 ) . as a result",
    "the number of photons @xmath28 required for ionization can be as large as few thousands , thus allowing to investigate the dynamical localization of chaos in great detail .",
    "experimental conditions are rather similar to those in previous experiments @xcite and are available now in modern laboratories .    here",
    "we have discussed the case of parallel fields in which the magnetic quantum number @xmath42 remains an integral of motion .",
    "it can be also interesting to study a more general situation with arbitrary field s orientation and polarization . in this case the density of coupled states will be even larger @xmath391 .",
    "this can lead to an additional growth of localization length by a factor @xmath31 and to a decrease of the delocalization border by a factor @xmath338 . at the same time",
    "the effective `` sample '' size @xmath28 can be increased by @xmath31 for such small frequencies as @xmath392 . however , this case deserves more detailed studies .",
    "indeed , the existence of additional approximate integrals of motion or the appearance of very slow adiabatic frequencies is not excluded ( especially for a static electric field ) and this may lead to new interesting results .",
