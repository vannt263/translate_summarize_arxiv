    "<S> we introduced a doubled system with periodic boundary conditions that is equivalent to the one on an interval . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the gge formalism applies to the computation of time averages of local operators and that the even integrals of motion form a complete set of local conserved quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we have used this approach to compute a quench where there are several small traps inside of a larger one and the smaller traps are released . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the quasiparticle density is additive . </S>",
    "<S> we have also calculated the expectation values of some local operators for this quench and in particular the time averaged velocity distribution . in the future </S>",
    "<S> it would be of interest to extend this work to models with bound states .    </S>",
