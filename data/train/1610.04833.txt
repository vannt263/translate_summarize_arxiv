    "of the `` fundamental geometries '' captured by berger s list of holonomy groups , the quaternionic unitary group stands out in that riemannian manifolds with holonomy in @xmath4 are einstein but not ricci - flat , unless locally hyperkhler . excluding the latter case , the study of these quaternion - khler manifolds splits into two cases , depending on the sign of the scalar curvature .",
    "the negative case is fairly flexible @xcite , but the situation of positive scalar curvature is extremely rigid .",
    "in fact , it is conjectured that a complete positive quaternion - khler manifold is necessarily one of the symmetric spaces that were first described by wolf @xcite .",
    "this rigidity suggests a quest for ways of weakening the holonomy condition .",
    "it turns out that dimension @xmath0 harbours a particularly natural type of almost quaternion - khler manifold .",
    "an appealing way of expressing an almost quaternionic hermitian structure is to say that our @xmath0-manifold admits a @xmath3-form that is pointwise linearly equivalent to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the standard hyperkhler triplet on @xmath7 : @xmath8 in these terms , the quaternion - khler condition then amounts to @xmath9 being parallel for the levi - civita connection , @xmath10 .",
    "swann @xcite observed that it is possible to have @xmath9 non - parallel and closed ( and so harmonic ) , but that closedness of the fundamental @xmath3-form implies quaternion - khler in dimension at least @xmath11 . using exterior differential systems ,",
    "bryant @xcite analysed the local existence of the `` harmonic '' @xmath12-structures and showed that solutions exist in abundance , even though the pde system at first looks overdetermined .",
    "in fact , involutivity of the exterior differential system can be deduced by observing that the contraction of @xmath9 with any vector @xmath13 induces a stable form on the quotient @xmath14 , cf.@xcite . in @xcite",
    "the third author provided the first compact non - parallel example of such a geometry . later",
    "many more examples have followed @xcite by reducing the internal symmetry group from the quaternionic unitary group to its intersection with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these previously known examples of non - parallel harmonic @xmath12-manifolds all have infinite fundamental group and associated metric of negative scalar curvature .",
    "a natural question is whether such structures with positive scalar curvature exist on simply - connected manifolds .",
    "we all thank robert bryant , david calderbank and andrew swann for useful comments .",

    "the point is to identify the principal and singular stabilisers ; the latter appear at @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "since the singular orbits have codimension strictly smaller than @xmath152 , both singular stabilisers are connected ( * ? ? ?",

    "then [ eqn : v4wedgebetas ] gives @xmath360 , which is absurd . in conclusion , @xmath350 can not occur , and the proof is complete .",
    "if we impose invariance , [ thm : nilpotent - pert ] can be simplified considerably .",
    "indeed , consider the @xmath0-dimensional representation of @xmath160 that models the tangent space to the open set formed of our principal orbits ( cf .",
    "[ eq : tspace - prc - orb ] ) .",

    "due to the way this @xmath160 acts on @xmath282 , we deduce that for the dual basis one has @xmath366 now , by making a change of basis if necessary , we can assume that @xmath367 corresponding to @xmath160 stabilising @xmath368 in @xmath127 , whose precise form can be recovered from lemma  [ lem : stab-3plane ] .",
    "computing its action on @xmath282 , we find @xmath369    since on nilpotent matrices the map @xmath370 is injective , the latter is invariant if and only if @xmath235 is invariant .",

    "in fact , it follows from results of the first author @xcite that if one considers the induced structure on a real analytic hypersurface @xmath375 ( in the language of @xcite , an @xmath308-structure with a closed @xmath3-form @xmath376 ) , then one can extend it to obtain a closed @xmath12-structure in a neighbourhood of @xmath237 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that there is more flexibility than that arising from local diffeomorphisms . in our cohomogeneity one setting , this indeterminacy can be seen by parametrising invariant forms in the @xmath377-orbit of the quaternion - khler @xmath3-form .",
    "these depend on @xmath378 functions , because relatively to , the centralizer of @xmath160 in @xmath379 has dimension @xmath380 and intersects @xmath12 in a 3-dimensional torus .",
    "explicit computations show that closedness of the form corresponds to @xmath381 equations , leaving @xmath382 undetermined functions , whilst equivariant diffeomorphisms only depend on one function .",
    "whilst the discussion above emphasises local flexibility , the method of section  [ sec : nil - pert ] proves to be a particularly useful approach to obtain examples that are both explicit and global .",

    "the perturbed metric happens to be genuinely different from the original only when this vector field is not killing .",
    "[ lemma : deformation_vector_field ] on each of the three wolf spaces , @xmath1-invariant closed nilpotent perturbations of the quaternion - khler structure @xmath383 have the form @xmath384 where @xmath385 is any smooth @xmath1-invariant function .",

    "let us first consider the vector bundle @xmath394 , where @xmath395 is the standard representation of @xmath124 , corresponding to a tubular neighbourhood of each singular orbit @xmath207 .",
    "away from the zero section , @xmath204 defines an invariant vector field . since @xmath396 , this vector field is vertical ,",
    "i.e. it is a @xmath124-invariant vector field on @xmath395 . in appropriate",

    "it follows by lemma  [ lemma : deformation_vector_field ] that each nilpotent perturbation can be associated with an @xmath1-invariant function @xmath385 and consequently an invariant vector field @xmath410 .",

    ", we notice that the cohomology class of a closed @xmath3-form on @xmath191 is determined by its restriction to the singular orbit @xmath420 , which is a quaternionic submanifold .",
    "since explicit verification shows that the quaternion - khler form and perturbed @xmath3-form both restrict to the volume form of @xmath207 , we conclude that they belong to the same cohomology class , as required .",
    "different choices of the perturbing function @xmath385 in [ thm : mainresult ] yield non - isometric metrics .",

    "therefore , the perturbing functions must coincide up to a constant .    as @xmath1-invariant functions on @xmath191 are in one - to - one correspondence with smooth even functions of period @xmath424 on the reals , it is easy to find explicit closed perturbations where @xmath385 is real - analytic .",
    "it is clear from [ eq : scalar - pertb ] that on @xmath191 we only have constant scalar curvature in the quaternion - khler case .",
    "if we are willing to remove the singular orbit @xmath207 , however , the conclusion changes :    the vector bundle @xmath402 admits non - einstein harmonic @xmath12-structures with constant scalar curvature .",

    "computations , similar to those of [ sec : cohom - one - ac ] , reveal that there are equivariant isomorphisms @xmath434 , and @xmath435 @xmath436 .",
