    "one of the greatest problems in physics is an inner electron structure . in classical and quantum electrodynamics",
    "it is considered that electron is a point - like particle .",
    "for example , feynman diagram technique in quantum electrodynamics is based on the assumption that electron is a point particle . only in this case",
    "the calculations based on this technique are valid .",
    "this technique is based on that the interaction between electron and photon takes place in a vertex , i.e. in a point .",
    "it means that we assume tacitly that electron is a point - like .    in classical electrodynamics",
    "there is a well known the paradox that the mass @xmath3 of the electric field of the electron has an infinite value @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electron charge , and @xmath6 is the electric coulomb field . the integral diverges on the lower limit as one believes that an electron is a point - like charge .    in quantum electrodynamics",
    "there exists a renormalization procedure .",
    "in particular , a renormalized electron mass is the remainder between a `` bare '' mass and a `` counter - term '' .",
    "both quantities are infinite but their remainder is finite one and it is equal to the observed electron mass .    at the beginning of last century einstein",
    "have assumed an idea that the electron is not a point - like but is a wormhole .",
    "further this idea was developed by j. wheeler @xcite .",
    "he called such structure as `` mass without mass '' and `` charge without charge '' .",
    "last decade there were observational facts speaking about accelerated expansion of the presented universe @xcite @xcite .",
    "the probable explanation of such fact is that the universe is filled with dark energy .",
    "dark energy has a negative pressure that leads to the antigravity and accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "one of model of dark energy is a phantom matter @xcite @xcite with negative kinetic term .    in this paper",
    "we would like to show now one can bring together these ideas ( `` mass without mass '' , phantom fields and the renormalization procedure from quantum field theory ) , and to show that this approach is related to an inner structure of an electron . in order to elaborate this idea",
    "we consider a wormhole filled with phantom scalar and electric fields .",
    "we show that , in some sense , such construction models a mass renormalization of a point - like charge without spin .",
    "in this section we will consider the electric field distribution on the background of a wormhole created by a phantom scalar field .",
    "let us consider maxwell s electrodynamics on the background of minkowski spacetime .",
    "the classical electron radius @xmath7 , is calculated from the definition of the energy of the electric field @xmath8 where @xmath6 is the coulomb field and @xmath7 is @xmath9 the modern experimental data evidence that the electron has not any structure on the scale @xmath10 .",
    "now we would like to consider a wormhole in gravity coupling with a phantom scalar field .",
    "the lagrangian of the system is @xmath11 in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that in such system there exists the following ( probably the simplest ) wormhole solution @xmath12 let us consider now electrostatic field on the background of the wormhole - .",
    "the maxwell equation @xmath13 give us the electric field @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the determinant of the metric .",

    "the calculations show that a wormhole solution created by electric and massless phantom fields has a _ negative _ energy . in order to avoid this problem",
    "we add a potential energy term for phantom scalar field to the lagrangian @xmath29 -       \\frac{1}{4 } f_{\\mu \\nu } f^{\\mu \\nu }   \\label{3 - 10}\\ ] ] where the potential energy for the phantom scalar field is @xmath30 \\label{3 - 20}\\ ] ] and @xmath31 are some parameters .",

    "we can hypothesize that if an electron has an inner structure ( which can be explained in quantum gravity ) then a phantom scalar field ( in an effective manner ) models ( mimics ) the renormalization procedure in quantum field theory .",
