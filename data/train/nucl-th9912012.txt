    "pions play a crucial role in chiral symmetry restoration , due to their goldstone boson character .",
    "the amount of restoration is measured by the modification of the order parameter , i.e. the quark condensate density , with respect to the vacuum value . in this context",
    "the evaluation of the expectation value of the squared pion field , linked to the scalar density of pions @xmath0 by @xmath1 , is of a great interest . for a single nucleon",
    "this quantity governs the total amount of chiral symmetry restoration of pionic origin , according to  @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scalar number of pions in the nucleon cloud , @xmath4 is the part of the nucleon @xmath5 commutator of pionic origin and @xmath6 represents the corresponding modification of the quark condensate with respect to the vacuum value .",
    "similarly , in a uniform nuclear medium of density @xmath7 , or in a heat bath , the evolution of the quark condensate originating from the pions is linked , to one - pion loop order , to the average value @xmath8 by  : @xmath9    the same quantity @xmath8 governs also the quenching factor , @xmath10 , of coupling constants such as the nucleonic axial coupling constant @xmath11 or the pion decay one @xmath12 , originating from pion loops , which is the counterpart of the mixing of axial and vector currents @xcite .",
    "this type of quenching has to be seen as a manifestation of chiral symmetry restoration and should also apply to the case of @xmath7 meson excitation by virtual photons as enters in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is therefore interesting to evaluate the quantity @xmath13 in the conditions of such experiments .",
    "now , the fireball which is the source of the dileptons contains , besides thermal pions , a significant residual baryonic background we have therefore to understand how the pion density evolves at finite values of both temperature and baryonic chemical potential . the first order approximation for the quantity",
    "@xmath14 adds the values for a pure heat bath and for a cold baryonic medium , writing with obvious notations  : @xmath15 however this approximation is likely to be crude since the temperature has an effect on the pion density of the nuclear medium and on the other hand the presence of the baryonic background modifies the number of pions thermally excited . as an illustration of the second point ,",
    "the pion density in the baryonic vacuum is fixed by the bose - einstein factor which is @xmath16 for pions of momentum @xmath17 , with @xmath18 . in the nuclear medium",
    "the pion becomes a quasi - particle with a broad width .",
    "it can decay for instance into a particle - hole pair which has a smaller energy than the free pion .",
    "its excitation is then favored by the thermal factor .",
    "there is therefore a mutual influence between temperature and density that we will investigate .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the first section",
    "we evaluate the pion density of a nuclear medium at zero temperature .",
    "we relate this quantity to the nuclear response to a pion - like excitation .",
    "we evaluate this response in the rpa scheme , taking also into account the two particle - two hole ( @xmath19-@xmath20 ) excitations . within this framework , we study the deviation with respect to the independent nucleon approximation . in the second section",
    "we introduce the effect of the temperature through the modification of the nuclear responses . in the third section",
    "we incorporate the influence of the finite baryonic chemical potential in the heat bath case .",
    "this quantity was discussed in relation to the quark condensate modification by chanfray and ericson @xcite .",
    "they discussed its deviations with respect to free nucleons , introducing the nuclear response to pion - like excitation , treated in the static case @xmath21 .",

    "the result is the replacement of the heaviside functions that characterize the occupation of fermion states at zero temperature by the fermi - dirac distributions .",

    "we now turn to the question of the thermal pions present in the heat bath .",
    "the effects previously discussed concerned only the modification , due to the temperature , of the virtual pion density present in the nuclear medium . at finite temperature , thermally excited pionic modes ( quasi - pions ) are also present and they give an additional contribution to the pion scalar density . here for a better illustration we give the result for @xmath100 which according to eq.([qqbar ] ) governs the amount of chiral symmetry restoration of pionic origin : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the bose occupation factor and @xmath103 the quasi - pion propagator .",

    "in conclusion we have studied the evolution of the quark condenaste of pionic origin under the simultaneous influence of the baryonic density and temperature .",
    "it is related to the scalar pionic density which comes on the one hand from the virtual nuclear pions and on the other hand from the thermally excited ones .",
    "we have expressed the first contribution in terms of the nuclear response to a pion - like excitation and evaluated it for the case of nuclear matter in the rpa scheme , first at zero and then at finite temperature .",
    "we have shown that the rpa produces a sizeable enhancement ( @xmath115 ) , while instead the temperature washes out the peaks and suppresses the nuclear response , hence decreasing the virtual pion density .",
    "as for the thermally excited pions we have shown that the presence of the baryonic background appreciably enhances their number .",
    "the cause has to be found in the lowering of the quasi - pion excitation energies , which favours their thermal excitation . when the densities of both types of pions are added , the mutual influences which go in opposite directions cancel their effects to a large extent . in the density and temperature domain that we have explored , the additive assumption of eq .",
    "( [ addit ] ) which neglects the mutual influence is a good approximation .",
    "it deviates from the exact result by no more than 15% , the deviation being maximum around @xmath116 mev . at this t value",
    "the additive approximation slightly overestimates the pionic density .",
    "our study has shown that , even at moderate baryonic density , the virtual nuclear pions are a major component of the overall scalar pion density . as an example , at nuclear matter density , they dominate in the temperature range we have considered , _",
    "i.e. _ up to at least @xmath117 mev .",
    "since the pion is the agent for the mixing of the vector and axial correlators , the consequence of our study is that the existence of a baryonic background , if any , should not be ignored in this mixing ."
