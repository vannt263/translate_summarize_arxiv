    "note that any hamiltonian @xmath98 can be decomposed into vertical and horizontal parts , i.e. it can be written in the form @xmath125 then @xmath126 but the trace on the right hand side is strictly negative if the vertical part of @xmath98 is nonzero .",

    "<S> this problem was formulated in @xcite , and solved more recently in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of the time - optimal hamiltonian that transports a given initial state to a target state , on the other hand , is _ a priori _ more challenging ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , because ( as shown below ) this involves a variational problem with free boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present paper is to derive the full solution to this latter problem for an arbitrary quantum system .    </S>",
    "<S> one way of addressing the quantum - state navigation problem is to work in the space of rays through the origin of the underlying hilbert space ( i.e. the complex projective space , or simply the ` state space ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the schrdinger evolution generated by the background field gives rise to a hamiltonian vector field on the state space , and the task at hand can be formulated as a hamiltonian control problem , the solution of which is typically difficult to obtain . </S>",
    "<S> we are nevertheless able to go forward by exploiting certain subtle geometric structures of the unitary group , which in turn allows us to efficiently make use of the results obtained in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable feature of the solution that we obtain is that it is strikingly reminiscent of the analysis of quantum dynamics in the interaction - picture of schwinger and tomonaga @xcite . on account of this observation </S>",
    "<S> we are able to revisit our analysis by employing a physical symmetry argument , rather than purely variational reasoning . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> a considerably simpler derivation of the solution emerges . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it turns out that by invoking the line of thinking behind the schwinger - tomonaga theory , a straightforward solution can even be found of closely - related and apparently difficult problems in geometry @xcite . for an illustration </S>",
    "<S> we conclude the paper by presenting examples in the case of a two - level system .    </S>",
    "<S> let us begin by stating more explicitly the zermelo navigation problem for quantum states : for a given initial state @xmath0 and a final target state @xmath1 , the task of an experimentalist is to find the control hamiltonian @xmath2 such that the total hamiltonian @xmath3 will generate the transformation @xmath4 in the shortest possible time . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 represents the hamiltonian of the background field or potential that can not be manipulated . </S>",
    "<S> since the objective is to realise a time - optimal transformation ( navigation ) , it is assumed that the available energy resource , which evidently has to be bounded , will be consumed fully . </S>",
    "<S> this translates into the ` full throttle ' condition that the squared magnitude of the evolution speed generated by the control hamiltonian @xmath6 , which is given on account of the anandan - aharonov relation @xcite by four times the variance @xmath7 of @xmath6 , is held fixed at all times at the maximum attainable value .     </S>",
    "<S> ( colour online ) _ unit circle in the wind_. in the absence of the wind , the ` unit - time ' circle is centred at the origin @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the prevailing wind , with strength @xmath9 , the unit - time circle reachable from the origin is shifted in the direction of the wind . </S>",
    "<S> since it takes one unit of time to reach @xmath10 , reaching the target @xmath11 will take @xmath12 units of time . ]    to illustrate the nature of the task involved , let us first consider a more elementary problem of zermelo navigation on the plane @xmath13 , with constant ( in space and in time ) wind , represented by the vector @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that , departing from the origin @xmath8 the desired destination is given by the endpoint of a vector @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> to work out the time it takes to reach the destination , consider a circle whose radius is determined by the distance that can be reached with full speed over one unit of time . in the absence of wind the circle is clearly centred at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> however , under the influence of the wind the centre of the circle is shifted by @xmath14 . for the moment </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the wind is not dominant , i.e. @xmath9 so that the origin remains inside the shifted circle . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration is schematically illustrated in figure  [ fig:1 ] . under the influence of the wind , therefore , to reach the endpoint @xmath11 of the vector @xmath15 , it suffices to determine the distance @xmath16 , where @xmath10 is the point of intersection of the vector @xmath17 with the shifted circle . </S>",
    "<S> this follows on account of the fact that since it takes one unit of time to reach @xmath10 , it will take @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the euclidean inner product , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> the foregoing analysis on @xmath13 extends naturally to the general case of navigation on a riemannian manifold of arbitrary dimension , albeit the euclidean inner product @xmath23 has to be replaced by the riemannian one . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the total journey time can be decomposed into a large number of infinitesimal journey times , each on a tangent space of the manifold . in the case of optimal quantum navigation </S>",
    "<S> , we recall that the space of pure states is equipped with the unitary - invariant fubini - study metric @xcite . the wind @xmath14 is then replaced by the hamiltonian symplectic flow generated by @xmath5 , whereas @xmath15 is some vector tangent to quantum state space . </S>",
    "<S> the total journey time @xmath24 along a path on state space is given by the integral of @xmath25 , where @xmath15 is the velocity vector . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the zermelo problem , @xmath15 is generated by @xmath3 , and this implies that @xmath25 in the quantum context is given by a function of the variance @xmath26 of @xmath5 , the variance @xmath27 of @xmath6 , and the covariance @xmath28 of the two hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal control is obtained by minimising @xmath24 over all @xmath2 , subject to the full throttle constraint @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the no - dominance condition on the wind is required in the case of a navigation problem on an open manifold such as @xmath30 , since otherwise the target may never be reached . in the quantum context we are able to relax the requirement @xmath31 , since the manifold of pure states is compact , which means that if the wind against the shortest path is too strong , one can always go ` the other way around ' to reach the target state ( note incidentally that @xmath25 remains well defined in the limit @xmath32 since @xmath33 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian control problem specified above is not straightforward to solve directly , and this leads us to employ an alternative approach based on the idea of lifting the problem from state space to the unitary group acting on the states . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , from a physical point of view this is more appealing , since , although we are seeking the time - optimal path on state space , physical implementations are always carried out by constructing the hamiltonian that generates the desired unitary operator .    </S>",
    "<S> bunt3.pdf ( 72.5 , 79.5)@xmath34 ( 16.40 , 14 ) @xmath0 ( 19.50 , 58 ) @xmath35 ( 22.50 , 73 ) @xmath5 ( 68.50 , 22 ) @xmath1 ( 74.0 , 9.0 ) @xmath36 ( 76.0 , 52 ) @xmath37 ( 74.5 , 41.50 ) @xmath38    with this in mind , we proceed by considering a fibre space above the state space with the property that for any state @xmath39 , the fibre above it consists of elements @xmath40 of the special unitary group fulfilling the condition that @xmath41 . although our solution is applicable to both finite and infinite dimensional hilbert spaces , to simplify the discussion let us assume that the hilbert space is of finite dimension @xmath42 . </S>",

    "<S> this configuration is illustrated in figure  [ fig:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath34 be an element of the fibre above the target state @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath44 . then the problem of finding the time - optimal transformation @xmath45 translates into the problem of constructing the unitary gate @xmath34 from the identity element @xmath46 in the shortest possible time , under the influence of an external field . </S>",
    "<S> this translation of the problem helps us because the optimal zermelo navigation for a specified unitary gate has been worked out recently @xcite , and we can make use of the result in deducing the optimal control hamiltonian for the state transfer ; however , we encounter two difficulties : ( a ) the ` target ' unitary gate @xmath34 is not unique since _ a priori _ it can be any element of the fibre above @xmath1 . in other words , if @xmath47 is any unitary operator that leaves the state @xmath1 invariant , then the unitary gate @xmath48 also satisfies the required condition @xmath49 so we have to deal with a free final boundary ; ( b ) the ` full throttle ' condition @xmath29 on state space is concerned with the evolution speed , whereas the condition used in @xcite for unitary gates appears to be distinct since it concerns the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath50 . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we shall show that these two apparent issues evaporate once the relevant ` horizontality condition ' is imposed .    to see this we begin by noting that since latexmath:[${\\hat e}|\\psi_i\\rangle=    the fibre above the initial state @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , </S>",
    "<S> the fibre above @xmath0 coincides with the totality of unitary group elements @xmath52 that leave the initial state @xmath0 invariant . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , to reach from @xmath35 a target gate @xmath34 above @xmath1 in a timely manner we would like to move away from @xmath35 as quickly as possible , and this is achieved by manoeuvring _ horizontally _ , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. towards a direction that is orthogonal to the fibre . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , the choice of the initial control hamiltonian @xmath53 has to be such that @xmath54 for all hamiltonians @xmath55 that leave the initial state invariant ( i.e. @xmath53 has to be orthogonal to all generators of @xmath56 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the horizontality condition @xmath57 gives rise to the maximum evolution speed . to show this more explicitly we shall derive a kind of universal quantum speed limit . </S>",
    "<S> the statement of the result we shall establish is as follows : the squared speed of the evolution of a quantum state generated by a hamiltonian @xmath58 , as defined by anandan and aharonov @xcite , is bounded above by twice the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath59 of the hamiltonian , and the bound is attained if @xmath58 is horizontal . </S>",
    "<S> the implication of this result is that under the horizontality requirement the norm condition and the maximum speed condition are equivalent , and this resolves the issue ( b ) raised above . as a consequence , we are able to borrow the results of @xcite to deduce that the time - optimal control hamiltonian @xmath2 is necessarily of the form @xmath60 notice that the horizontality condition is preserved under the adjoint action ( [ eq:2 ] ) , which is indeed required since the full - throttle condition has to be maintained throughout the operation    the horizontality condition alone , of course , does not fix @xmath53 uniquely , since the constraint @xmath57 on @xmath53 leaves @xmath61 degrees of freedom . however , by demanding that the required gate should generate the target state @xmath1 , which imposes @xmath61 conditions , we are able to select a unique initial control hamiltonian @xmath53 . in other words , the freedom in the boundary is eliminated by the horizontality condition @xmath57 along with the boundary condition @xmath44 , and this resolves the issue ( a ) raised above .    </S>",
    "<S> before we turn to determining the initial control hamiltonian @xmath53 , and the amount of time @xmath24 that is needed to reach the target state under the optimal control , let us discuss the claim above on the universal speed limit ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . from a physical point of view </S>",
    "<S> the claim is plausible if we make note of the following observation . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the hamiltonian contains a vertical component tangent to the fibre that leaves the state below invariant . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , although energy is scarce , the experimentalist will be consuming energy that produces no work ( except for shifting the overall phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly not energy efficient . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the optimal performance is ensured by eliminating vertical components altogether . a more precise derivation , which essentially follows from a standard result on complex projective spaces outlined , e.g. , in kobayashi & nomizu @xcite ( see   xi.10 ) , is given in the supplementary information .    </S>",
    "<S> having established the ` geodesic ' curve ( [ eq:2 ] ) that minimises the action @xmath62 we are now in the position to identify the initial control @xmath53 so that the target state is reached . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the form ( [ eq:2 ] ) of the solution is indicative of the analysis in the interaction picture of quantum mechanics , if we view @xmath5 as the ` free ' and @xmath53 as the ` interaction ' hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively stated , if we change from the ` rest frame ' to the ` moving frame ' on the state space according to the wind @xmath5 , then without the control hamiltonian the initial state remains fixed , while the target state moves against the wind according to @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the state @xmath64 thus defined is the solution to the ( nonrelativistic version of ) the tomonaga - schwinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , standard results in the interaction - picture analysis @xcite show that the time - ordered product of the unitary group generated by the hamiltonian @xmath65 gives rise to the evolution equation of the form @xmath66 this result can also be verified directly ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) by differentiation : writing @xmath67 , we find @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> as indicated above , to fix the initial condition @xmath53 we need to make use of the boundary condition , which implies that @xmath69 must hold for some @xmath24 that is to be determined . </S>",
    "<S> observe that there are @xmath61 unknowns in @xmath53 , and we have an additional unknown parameter @xmath24 . the boundary condition ( [ eq:4 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> gives rise to @xmath61 constraints . </S>",
    "<S> together with the norm condition @xmath50 we are thus able to fix all the unknowns , and this in turn solves the quantum - state zermelo navigation problem .    </S>",

    "<S> ( 40.5 , 14 ) @xmath71 ( 44.7 , 13.3 ) * . </S>",
    "<S> *    to proceed with this let us rewrite ( [ eq:4 ] ) in the form @xmath72 although the transformation from ( [ eq:4 ] ) to ( [ eq:5 ] ) is in itself trivial , it sheds a different light on the problem at hand . as indicated above , </S>",
    "<S> if we transform to the moving frame generated by the wind such that the initial state remains stationary , then the objective becomes ` hitting ' a moving target @xmath73 as quickly as possible . </S>",
    "<S> exactly how long it will take to achieve this task depends on how fast the motion towards the target can be , but for a fixed speed the shortest time @xmath24 achievable is attained by following the geodesic path on the state space joining @xmath0 and @xmath74 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the curve @xmath75 joining @xmath0 and @xmath76 is a geodesic on the fubini - study manifold if and only if @xmath53 is horizontal , and this is indeed the situation we have in ( [ eq:5 ] ) . to determine @xmath53 explicitly , </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath77 be the angular distance between @xmath0 and @xmath74 defined by the relation : @xmath78 evidently , the angular distance @xmath79 is given by the speed @xmath80 of the evolution generated by @xmath53 multiplied by the duration @xmath24 of the journey , but the evolution speed is fixed on account of the condition @xmath50 to @xmath81 , so we deduce that @xmath82 since @xmath5 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 are given , we see therefore that the smallest positive root of ( [ eq:7 ] ) uniquely determines @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath24 is fixed , the optimal control hamiltonian at time zero can be obtained explicitly by making use of the result in @xcite : @xmath83 note that without loss of generality we can adjust the overall phase such that @xmath84 ) , one can easily verify that this hamiltonian is indeed horizontal .    </S>",
    "<S> this completes the derivation of the solution to the quantum - state zermelo navigation problem : the optimal control hamiltonian is given by ( [ eq:2 ] ) , where @xmath53 is given by ( [ eq:8 ] ) and where the parameter @xmath24 is determined by ( [ eq:7 ] ) . to gain further intuition on the behaviour of the solution , in figure  [ fig:3 ] we plot the trajectories of the quantum state generated by the hamiltonian @xmath85 in the case of a two - level system . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show the time - optimal paths for a range of wind strengths , indicating for instance that if the head wind is too strong , then the optimal strategy is to switch the direction of the manoeuvre to turn the head wind into a tailwind . to understand the minimum journey times associated with different wind strengths we have also considered a one - parameter family of winds @xmath86 , corresponding to the setup shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] , and determined the optimal time @xmath87 for a range of @xmath88 ; the result is shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] .     </S>",
    "<S> ( colour online ) _ journey time on the bloch sphere_. the trajectories @xmath89 sketched in figure  [ fig:3 ] correspond to the wind hamiltonian @xmath86 for @xmath90 , for the choice of @xmath5 sketched therein . here </S>",
    "<S> , journey time @xmath87 is plotted for a continuous range of @xmath88 , showing that once the wind strength is sufficiently strong , by going the other way around , @xmath24 can be reduced by turning head wind into a tailwind . ]    in summary , we have been able to deduce in closed form the solution to the quantum zermelo problem in complete generality . </S>",
    "<S> since the result obtained takes a rather simple form , we expect that a practical implementation is feasible in a number of realistic situations . </S>",
    "<S> of course , for some applications the controllable degrees of freedom in the hamiltonian can be limited , in which case additional constraints will have to be imposed in finding the optimal control  some steps towards this direction in the context of unitary gates have been initiated in @xcite . in fact , further progress can again be made by switching to the interaction picture : if we write @xmath91 for the @xmath92 constraints on the control hamiltonian , then in the moving frame the constraints will take for each @xmath93 the form @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the generator of the dynamics @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of @xcite , for instance , can then be applied with essentially just one modification , namely , that the target state is moving . </S>",
    "<S> the initial control hamiltonian can then be identified by adapting the strategy proposed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the use of the interaction picture , or equivalently the switch to the moving frame , which allowed us to simplify the problem considerably , has implications beyond the quantum navigation problem considered here . in this connection </S>",
    "<S> we remark that if we endow the quantum state space with the metric of the form ( [ eq:1 ] ) , then the resulting space is known as a randers space ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , which is an example of a finsler space ( for @xmath97 the space reduces to a kropina space ) . in the literature of finsler geometry </S>",
    "<S> it is known that every zermelo navigation problem on a riemannian manifold can be solved by finding geodesics of the corresponding randers space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the classification of spaces in terms of their curvatures is of particular importance in geometry , and in the case of randers spaces the identification of constant curvature metrics has been obtained by solving the associated navigation problem when the wind is a conformal vector field with constant scale factor @xcite ( the field generated by a unitary motion belongs to this class , with vanishing scale factor ) . however , and with hindsight , the main theorem of @xcite can be proven in essentially two lines by adopting the interaction picture , and this shows that in the present context a physical intuition can offer insights into a purely mathematical question . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by remarking that an interesting generalisation of the present problem is to consider the case under which the external influences contain noise . </S>",
    "<S> in such a situation , the idea of reaching a target pure state is no longer tenable , whereas reaching a particular mixed state might be feasible . </S>",
    "<S> although there appears to be a surprisingly limited amount of work in the stochastic extensions of the zermelo navigation problem ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , extensions into the mixed - state domain are desirable for the designing and understanding of more robust controlled quantum dynamics .    </S>",
