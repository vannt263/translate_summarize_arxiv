    "the search for the scalar particles referred to as `` higgs bosons '' @xcite is one of the major goals of present and future colliders .",
    "such particles break the electroweak symmetry and are responsible for the masses of the fermions and bosons .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) @xcite predicts one neutral scalar ( @xmath8 ) while extensions of the sm often predict several scalars , both neutral and charged @xcite . since 1989 the @xmath9 collider lep",
    "has searched for @xmath8 . in the final run at energies around @xmath10 gev two of the four experiments found excesses in the search for a higgs boson in association with a z boson @xcite . although it was agreed that a further run with about 200 pb@xmath11 per experiment at a centre  of  mass energy of 208.2 gev would enable the four experiments to establish a 5@xmath12 discovery ( assuming the signal is genuine ) @xcite , the extended run was not approved and lep was consequently shut down .",
    "the search for higgs bosons will continue with run ii at the tevatron @xcite which has a chance of confirming the existence of the higgs boson in the mass range hinted at by lep ( @xmath13 gev ) .",
    "this region is fairly problematic for the lhc @xcite and would require several years searching in the channel @xmath14 to confirm such a light higgs .",
    "a higher  energy @xmath9 collider ( nlc ) operating at energies @xmath15 gev would be an ideal place to perform precision measurements of a higgs boson @xcite,@xcite .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) theories , in particular the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , are currently considered as the most theoretically well motivated extensions of the sm .",
    "such models predict a rich higgs phenomenology .",
    "the mssm contains 2 neutral cp  even scalars ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , a cp  odd neutral scalar @xmath18 , and a pair of charged scalars ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "energy @xmath9 colliders offer a very clean environment in which to search for higgs bosons , and the simplest way to produce a cp  even scalar is in the higgsstrahlung process @xmath20 and the @xmath21 boson fusion process @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "odd @xmath18 possesses no tree ",
    "level coupling @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 ) and the other tree  level diagrams contributing to @xmath25 are proportional to the electron mass and consequently negligible can not be discarded anymore and higher order diagrams would induce corrections to the tree - level rate . ] .",
    "therefore the dominant contribution to @xmath25 is from higher order diagrams . in previous works we calculated the",
    "1loop induced rate in the context of the cp  conserving thdm @xcite and the cp  conserving mssm @xcite , finding maximum values of order 0.01 fb and 0.1 fb respectively if @xmath26 .",
    "the higgsstrahlung , vector boson fusion , and higgs pair production mechanisms ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , have all been extensively studied ( including radiative corrections @xcite ) at nlc energies in the context of the mssm .    in recent years the phenomenology of the mssm with complex susy parameters has received growing attention @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "such phases may allow baryogenesis @xcite , and do not necessarily violate the stringent bound from the non  observation of electric dipole moments ( edms ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the presence of susy phases induces mixing between the cp  even and cp  odd scalars , resulting in the mass eigenstates @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 which are mixed states of cp .",
    "this mixing affects their phenomenology at present and future colliders , both in production mechanisms and decay partial widths @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study the processes @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the context of a nlc .",
    "both mechanisms are mediated by the tree ",
    "level couplings @xmath34 , but their cross  sections have different phase space and @xmath35 dependence . in the cp",
    "conserving case one of these couplings would be zero , corresponding to the absence of the coupling @xmath23 .",
    "we will also study the production of neutral higgs pairs , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) . in the cp conserving mssm , only the vertices @xmath38 and @xmath39 exist at tree",
    " level while in the cp violating scenario all three couplings @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are generated at tree  level .",
    "therefore an observable signal for all @xmath43 in a given mechanism ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) , would be a way of probing cp violation in the higgs sector .",
    "such an approach was used in the context of the thdm in @xcite , with related analyses in @xcite .",
    "we will calculate the tree ",
    "level rates of the above mechanisms in the context of the cp violating mssm , showing that in the most favourable scenarios this way of probing scalar  pseudoscalar mixing can be effective if @xmath5 gev .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline our approach for evaluating the cross  sections for the above production mechanisms in the cp violating mssm . in section 3",
    "we present our numerical results and section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "the tree  level higgs potential of the mssm conserves cp , which ensures that the three neutral higgs eigenstates can be divided into the cp  even @xmath16 and @xmath17 and cp",
    " odd @xmath18 .",
    "recent studies @xcite have shown that the 1loop effective potential may violate cp resulting in three higgs mass eigenstates which can not be assigned a definite cp quantum number , denoted by @xmath47,@xmath48 and @xmath31 ( in ascending order of mass ) . in the above studies it is shown that the cp violation is generated by complex phases which reside in the @xmath49 term and the soft susy breaking parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these phases generate terms @xmath52 in the @xmath53 neutral higgs mass squared matrix @xmath54 which mix the cp  odd and cp  even scalar fields .",
    "these may be given approximately by @xcite @xmath55 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 , and we have only displayed the contributions from the top squarks , @xmath57 , which are dominant for small @xmath58 .",
    "sizeable scalar  pseudoscalar mixing is possible for large @xmath59,@xmath60 . in @xcite",
    "the mass matrix @xmath54 is evaluated to one  loop order using the effective potential techniques and includes large two  loop non  logarithmic corrections induced by one - loop threshold effects on the top and bottom quark yukawa coupling .",
    "the public code which we will employ in our numerical analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "if the susy phases are set to zero , the mass eigenstates become definite eigenstates of cp . a phenomenological consequence of the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing is that all the eigenstates @xmath61 possess a tree ",
    "level coupling @xmath62 with respective strength @xmath63 ( normalized to sm strength ) .",
    "these couplings can be easily obtained from the covariant derivative of the higgs fields in which the non  physical higgs fields are expressed in terms of the physical mass eigenstates . following the convention of @xcite , the @xmath63",
    "are given by : @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the orthogonal matrix which diagonalizes @xmath54 .",
    "one can easily show that @xmath66 note that this sum rule applies to the tree ",
    "level vertices , although it holds to a very good approximation if higher order corrections to the vertices are included .",
    "we will present results using the tree ",
    "level values for @xmath63 which we will generate by use of the program cph.f @xcite .    in the cp conserving mssm scalar  pseudoscalar mixing is absent . in this case",
    "@xmath67 , while one of @xmath68,@xmath69 is identified as @xmath70 , and the other is identically zero .",
    "@xmath71 corresponds to the couplings @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which will take on a non  zero value at 1-loop .",
    "hence to lowest order in the mssm only @xmath47 and _ one _ of @xmath48 , @xmath31 can be produced in the higgsstrahlung and @xmath74 fusion mechanisms , @xmath32 and @xmath75 . in the presence of susy phases all @xmath61",
    "may be produced at tree ",
    "level via @xmath32 , and an observable signal for all three @xmath61 would be evidence for cp violation in the higgs sector .",
    "we stress here that the smallest of @xmath76 should exceed the maximum rate for @xmath25 in the context of the cp conserving mssm @xcite , since the latter would constitute a `` background '' to any interpretation of scalar  pseudoscalar mixing .",
    "note that the process @xmath75 proceeds via the same couplings @xmath63 , but possesses a different phase space and @xmath35 dependence .",
    "this mechanism is competitive with the higgsstrahlung process , and becomes the dominant one as @xmath35 increases .",
    "we will also consider the mechanism @xmath77 , which proceeds via the coupling @xmath78 , where @xmath79 for @xmath80 .    in the mssm ( with or without susy phases )",
    ", the properties of the lightest eigenstate @xmath47 become very similar to that of the sm higgs boson in the decoupling region of @xmath81 gev . in this region",
    ", @xmath82 is very close to 1 , and so the sum @xmath83 is constrained to be small ( eq . ( [ sum ] ) ) . therefore we expect that @xmath84 gev will allow larger values for the sum @xmath83 , and thus observable rates for both @xmath48 and @xmath31 in the above mechanisms . following the approach of @xcite we will take the threshold of observability as @xmath85 fb",
    ". this would give 50 raw events ( before cuts ) for the assumed luminosities of 500 @xmath86 .",
    "distinct signals for all three @xmath61 in a given channel would be evidence for scalar  pseudoscalar mixing . note that @xcite found maximum values of @xmath87 fb in the context of the cp conserving mssm .",
    "a caveat here is that extended higgs sectors with more than two doublets or extra higgs singlets ( e.g. the nmssm ) would also predict multiple signals in these mechanisms @xcite .",
    "we will show that the cp violating mssm can only produce multiple signals below a certain mass for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and thus any such signal for a larger higgs mass would be evidence against the cp violating mssm . therefore the measurement of the higgs mass may act as a discriminator among the models .",
    "we now present our numerical results which we will generate with the fortran program cph.f @xcite .",
    "we note that this program does not include @xmath90@xmath21@xmath91 contributions to the 1loop neutral higgs mass matrix , which have been shown to be sizeable in some regions of parameter space @xcite .",
    "the analytic expressions for the various cross ",
    "sections are given in the literature @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath74 fusion process we will use the exact expression given in @xcite .",
    "graphs showing the numerical values of the couplings @xmath63 and @xmath92 have appeared in refs @xcite . however , these papers were more concerned with light @xmath88 and @xmath89 of interest at lep2 and the tevatron .",
    "detection at these colliders would require quite sizeable values for @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we are concerned with a nlc collider which has the ability to probe @xmath95 fb , and so we are also interested in smaller values for @xmath93,@xmath94 and larger @xmath96 .",
    "an earlier discussion of the potential of a nlc to probe scalar  pseudoscalar mixing can be found in @xcite .",
    "however this study only addressed the pair production process @xmath97 and numerical results were only presented for the couplings @xmath98 .",
    "we shall be presenting results for the production cross  sections of all the above mechanisms , in contrast to @xcite which were more concerned with the numerical values of @xmath63 and @xmath92 and lep2 phenomenology . since the @xmath74 fusion process is considerably more important at nlc energies than at lep2 energies , our analysis is complementary to that in @xcite and extends that of @xcite . for alternative ways of probing cp violating susy phases at @xmath9 colliders ,",
    "see @xcite .    as noted in the introduction , the cross  sections for the processes @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the cp conserving mssm are accurately known @xcite .",
    "deviations from these rates would be evidence for scalar  pseudoscalar mixing .",
    "the presence of large susy phases can give contributions to the edm which exceed the experimental upper bound . to avoid conflict with experiment one",
    "may assume that the masses of first two generation of squarks are well above the tev scale while the third generation may be relatively light ( @xmath104 tev ) @xcite .",
    "a recent paper @xcite suggests that sizeable scalar  pseudoscalar mixing would prefer the cancellation mechanism @xcite over the above mechanism as the solution to keep the value of edm within the experimental limits .",
    "another option is to adopt a non  universal scenario for the tri  linear couplings @xmath105 @xcite . in particular",
    ", one may require @xmath106 and @xmath107 , with @xmath50,@xmath51 and @xmath108 taking maximal phases .",
    "such a scenario comfortably satisfies the edm constraints .",
    "since the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing @xmath109 , it is sufficient to have maximal phase in @xmath50 to maximize @xmath110 .",
    "however , two  loop barr - zee type diagrams @xcite can violate the edm constraints for large @xmath58 ( @xmath111 ) . therefore we will restrict ourselves to low to intermediate values of @xmath58 .    in our numerical analysis we will choose the cp violating benchmark scenario ( cpx ) which was introduced in @xcite and maximizes the cp violating effects .",
    "the cpx scenario is as follows : @xmath112 note that @xmath49 will be taken real while we allow a cp phase in the soft tri - linear parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 and in @xmath113 .",
    "the cp phases of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are chosen to be equal and may be maximal .",
    "in addition , we choose the charged higgs mass and @xmath58 as free parameters .    our strategy to probe the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing requires the identification of the higgs signals as distinct resonances .",
    "the inclusion of the phases in @xmath50 and @xmath51 breaks the near degeneracy among @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite , and gives sufficient splittings to allow identification of separate resonances for @xmath48 and @xmath31 .",
    "these splittings may be @xmath114 gev , which is sufficiently large for a nlc @xcite to resolve the separate peaks .",
    "this will lead to three different peaks in the higgsstrahlung and @xmath74 fusion processes and motivates us to present the individual cross ",
    "sections for @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "this is in contrast to @xcite where the study was devoted to lepii energies and the cross  sections were summed over the three higgs states .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the inclusion of susy phases may drastically change the size of the couplings @xmath118 and @xmath40 for low and intermediate @xmath58 .",
    "in such cases the bound on the light higgs boson obtained at lepii may be weakened to @xmath119 gev for large cp violation in the mssm higgs sector .",
    "we study the potential of a nlc to discover such a weakly coupled higgs .    in fig .",
    "1 the left ( right ) plots depict regions of @xmath120 ) in the plane ( @xmath96,arg(@xmath50 ) ) for @xmath121 gev , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 gev . in all plots",
    "the charged higgs mass has been varied in increments from 140 @xmath124 400 gev , which determines the values of @xmath96 .",
    "comparing the left and right plots it is clear that lower @xmath58 provides larger cross ",
    "sections for @xmath48 and @xmath31 over a wider region of the plane , corresponding to the fact that the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing is enhanced . for @xmath47 discovery is possible over most of the ( @xmath125,arg(@xmath50 ) ) plane , with small unobservable regions where @xmath126 fb which occur for @xmath127 for @xmath122 and @xmath128 gev .",
    "the smallness of @xmath129 is due to the suppression of @xmath82 .",
    "this suppression arises when @xmath130 changes sign , which induces destructive interference in eq .",
    "( [ coupl ] ) .",
