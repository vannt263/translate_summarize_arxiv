    "the simulation of systems containing a large number of mobile charged entities , in which long range electrostatic forces play a central dynamical role , is of critical importance in modern chemical physics and biophysics . in many cases ,",
    "the computational load is dominated by the evaluation of the electrostatic energy of the system , where the long - range character of the coulomb interaction greatly complicates the development of efficient algorithms that scale with system size in a way that permits study of systems of biophysical interest .",
    "developments in supercomputing technology aimed at large - scale biophysical simulations , such as the ibm bluegene project @xcite , where massively parallel assemblies of processor nodes are coupled via a three - dimensional toroidal topology , suggest that algorithms based on a local energy functional will be much more efficiently executed on the next generation of high - end computing platforms than those involving long - range nonlocal effects .",
    "recently , maggs and collaborators @xcite have suggested an ingenious procedure for removing the nonlocal ( long - ranged ) coulomb term in equilibrium simulations of coulomb gases . by using a completely local hamiltonian for a system of mobile charged particles interacting with the electrostatic field , one avoids the unpleasant scaling characteristics of conventional coulomb gas simulations .",
    "unfortunately ( as pointed out by these authors themselves @xcite ) , the algorithm they propose runs into serious acceptance problems in regions of physical interest ( basically , for strongly fluctuating systems ) . in this paper , we study the origin of these acceptance problems and propose an improved algorithm that allows useful simulations of strongly fluctuating systems in which mean - field ( or poisson - boltzmann ) methods break down .    in section 2 we briefly review the original technique of maggs et al , and explain the origin of the acceptance difficulty for charged particle moves . in section 3 we explain the modified update procedure designed to cure , or at least ameliorate , the acceptance problem for particle moves . in brief ,",
    "the crucial point is to implement a coupled particle - field update in which the electrostatic field is allowed to readjust itself in tandem with charged particle moves in response to the changed electrostatic environment . in section 4",
    ", the improved procedure is tested in detail on a system that has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite : the osmotic pressure of charged plates ( or membranes ) separated by an ionic fluid .",
    "finally , in section 5 we briefly summarize our conclusions .",
    "the difficulties incurred by the nonlocal nature of the coulomb interaction in realistic simulations of large systems ( for example , for large biomolecular systems ) are well known : the computational cost increases as the square of the number of charged constituents , and although various techniques ( ewald summation , fast fourier transforms etc .",
    "@xcite ) can be employed to improve this scaling , the resulting complications in the algorithm often mean that the computation of the electrostatic energy still consumes essentially all of the computational effort , greatly limiting the size of the systems and ( in the case of molecular dynamics simulations ) the time frames over which the simulations can be extended .",
    "these techniques also have difficulties modeling a non - uniform dielectric constant , which is an important feature of many biophysical systems@xcite as the dielectric constant in proteins is @xmath0 while the dielectric constant of water is @xmath1 . in the case of systems at equilibrium",
    ", it has been known for some time @xcite that the nonlocal coulomb interaction can be replaced by a completely local interaction via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation , yielding a path integral formalism that connects naturally with the poisson - boltzmann mean - field theory .",
    "unfortunately , for strongly fluctuating systems perturbation theory ( saddle - point expansions ) breaks down in this approach , and a direct numerical simulation is obstructed by a severe sign problem .",
    "recently , maggs and collaborators @xcite have proposed an alternative , purely local approach to the simulation of charged condensed systems .",
    "they exploit the fact that the nonlocality of the coulomb interaction is a consequence of a particular choice of gauge for describing the electromagnetic field , whereas the physically relevant quantity the electrostatic energy of the system must clearly be a gauge - invariant object .",
    "they propose that the electromagnetic field be simulated in terms of gauge - invariant objects ( specifically , the electric field ) , represented on a discrete spatial lattice . in this respect",
    ", the method proposed is essentially the same as that employed for over 20 years by elementary particle theorists attacking the problem of strong interactions with the technique of lattice quantum chromodynamics . for a review see ref .  .",
    "the main distinction here is that the gauge theory involved is the abelian one of maxwellian electrodynamics , magnetic effects are not relevant , and the formulation used is a noncompact one ( i.e. the electric field variables take unbounded values ) .",
    "let us briefly recall the salient points of the formalism of maggs et al @xcite .",
    "the canonical partition function for a set of mobile charges @xmath2 at locations @xmath3 at inverse temperature @xmath4 in a medium of dielectric constant @xmath5 may be written @xmath6 where the charge density @xmath7 is shorthand for @xmath8 the delta function constraint in eq .",
    "[ eq : partfunc ] enforces gauss law , so that the electric fields integrated over correspond to the particle locations specified through the density function @xmath9 .",
    "the formulation is manifestly local , as both the energy functional and gauss law constraint are so .",
    "there is no requirement that the electric fields integrated over be irrotational , and in fact they are not ; as shown by maggs et al.@xcite , the transverse part of the electric field simply decouples from the particle sector and contributes an irrelevant overall prefactor to @xmath10 .",
    "because this formalism is local , it is easily extended to model physical systems with a non - uniform dielectric constant @xcite .",
    "the functional integral over electric field in eq .",
    "[ eq : partfunc ] can be given a precise definition by introducing a spatial cubical lattice , which we shall for the time being take to be a grid of @xmath11 points , with lattice spacing @xmath12 ( in all directions : the modifications needed in case of an asymmetric lattice are discussed below ) and periodic wrap - around boundary conditions in all three spatial directions .",
    "the charges @xmath13 are assumed to be integer multiples of a basic unit of charge , @xmath14 , @xmath15 integer , and reside on the sites of the lattice .",
    "the component @xmath16 of electric field in direction @xmath17 at lattice site @xmath18 is associated with a real - valued field @xmath19 on the oriented link @xmath20 from @xmath18 to @xmath21 . discretizing the 3-dimensional integral for the electrostatic energy in the obvious way",
    ", we find @xmath22    the implementation of the simulation is simplified by introducing dimensionless variables to the greatest extent possible , so we define @xmath23 and a rescaled inverse temperature @xmath24 , in terms of which the energy becomes @xmath25 while the gauss law constraint takes the simple form @xmath26 for the sum of outgoing link fields from any site containing a charged particle of charge @xmath27 .",
    "the simulation of the system defined by the energy function in eq .",
    "[ eq : hrescale ] and the constraint in eq .",
    "[ eq : gauss ] can in principle be accomplished by the following algorithm :    1 .",
    "pick starting lattice locations ( possibly randomly ) for the @xmath28 particles of charge @xmath29 . then solve gauss law for these fixed charge locations to obtain a starting configuration of electric link field variables satisfying the gauss constraint .",
    "this can easily be done by standard numerical relaxation methods @xcite .",
    "2 .   update the electric fields by shifting all link variables along a complete set of independent closed paths by constant shifts , using either metropolis or heat bath procedures to accept / reject proposed shifts .",
    "the simplest version of this is simply to consider all plaquettes ( unit squares ) on the lattice , shifting the 4 link fields ordered around the plaquette by the same random amount @xmath30 , the range of @xmath30 set so that there is a reasonable acceptance rate for the move .",
    "such a shift clearly maintains the gauss law constraint .",
    "3 .   update particle locations by visiting in turn every site @xmath31 containing a charged particle of charge @xmath15 . a particle move to the neighboring site @xmath21 in a random direction @xmath17",
    "is then considered , where the particle move is accompanied with a shift of the electric field @xmath19 on the link @xmath32 @xmath33 in order to maintain the constraint in eq .",
    "[ eq : gauss ] . here",
    "also one can employ either metropolis or heat - bath accept / reject procedures .",
    "the inclusion of additional force fields , for example soft or hard exclusion potentials modeling a finite size for the particles , is , in principle , completely straightforward in this framework . when particles are packed closely together , or the potential changes rapidly over the scale of a lattice spacing , then it is important to verify that the observed phenomena are not distorted by lattice discretization effects .",
    "it is useful to be able to study the effects of lattice discretization in such situations by introducing asymmetric lattices , in which the lattice spacing in the various directions differs . as a specific example , consider a situation in which we may desire a finer discretization in the x - direction , relative to the y and z directions , @xmath34 .",
    "one readily verifies that with the choice of the dimensionless variables @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the set of links in the @xmath30 direction and , as before , @xmath37 the energy function becomes @xmath38 while the gauss law constraint retains its original form given in eq .",
    "[ eq : gauss ] .    unfortunately , despite the appealing simplicity of the simulation procedure outlined above , in physically realistic situations involving strongly charged systems the method proves impractical , for reasons we now explain .",
    "the dimensionless inverse temperature variable @xmath39 is typically large compared to unity ( in the charged plate / membrane problem considered in section 4 , the value is 87.1 ) , so that typical values for the electric field link variables are small compared to unity . on the other hand ,",
    "executing a particle move across a link via eq .",
    "[ eq : particlemove ] shifts the electric field variable on that link by an integer , and this generally leads to an unacceptable energy cost ( on the order of @xmath39 ) . in the univalent case ( @xmath40 ) ,",
    "acceptance rates for particle moves are of the order of 10@xmath41 , while for divalent ions ( @xmath42 ) the acceptance rate is at best of order 10@xmath43 .",
    "thus the unmodified procedure of maggs et al .",
    "is clearly not a practical approach in situations approximating real biophysical systems . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss a modified simulation algorithm in which this problem is ameliorated to an acceptable level .",
    "the problem of very inefficient particle moves mentioned in the preceding section needs to be resolved before the local hamiltonian method can be applied fruitfully to realistic problems with strongly fluctuating coulomb gases . recall that the hamiltonian , as a function of the electric field variables @xmath19 defined on the links @xmath20 of the lattice takes the form @xmath44 where the dimensionless inverse - temperature variable , @xmath39 , is quite large for the systems that we are interested in studying ( in the range of 50 - 100 ) . as discussed above",
    ", the vast majority of particle moves with such a hamiltonian have a high energy cost leading to an unacceptably low acceptance rate . in this section",
    "we will show that this problem can be substantially ameliorated though not completely eliminated by a coupled update procedure in which electric field values on all the plaquettes containing the link along which the particle move is attempted are simultaneously adjusted to reflect the changed electrical environment resulting from the particle move .",
    "as an example of a simple procedure that can considerably improve the acceptance rate for particle moves , consider the situation illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquettes ] .",
    "here we are considering the move of a unit charge particle from the beginning ( bottom ) site to the end ( top ) site of the central link associated with field variable @xmath45 . in conjunction with the particle move , we consider simultaneous electric field updates corresponding to plaquette variable shifts @xmath46 on the four plaquettes containing the link @xmath45 , as indicated in the figure .",
    "such a combined move changes the energy associated with the illustrated region from @xmath47 to @xmath48 in practice one finds that the electric field variables equilibrate to values which are small compared to unity : in the approximation where we simply set @xmath49 in equations [ eq : hbefore ] and [ eq : hafter ] , the energy cost of the combined move becomes @xmath50 minimizing eq .",
    "[ eq : zeroe ] with respect to the @xmath51 , we find that the choice @xmath52 gives the minimum energy cost @xmath53 as opposed to the cost @xmath54 if the particle move is unaccompanied by any readjustment of nearby link fields .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , if @xmath39 is large , this is enough to increase the acceptance rate for particle moves to a level where configurations can be decorrelated at an acceptable rate .",
    "thus , a quick and easily implementable improvement of the basic algorithm can be obtained by a metropolis accept / reject step in which the choices for a particle move on a chosen link are ( a ) do nothing ( to particle or fields ) , or ( b ) perform the combined update in which the particle is transferred to the end site of the link and the fields around the four intersecting plaquettes are shifted by @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that the energy cost can be further reduced by allowing readjustments of plaquettes adjacent to those depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquettes ] . in particular , if the link @xmath45 in fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquettes ] corresponds to the @xmath56 direction , then adding the remaining @xmath57 and @xmath58 plaquettes that contain the links @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and performing the relevant minimization , one finds however that the reduction in energy cost is only about 10% , with a considerable complication in the algorithm . in this paper",
    "we have chosen to implement only the simplest ( most local ) version of a coupled move - field update , corresponding to the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquettes ] .    a more general procedure , in which a heat - bath update on the combined ( particle move)+(field update ) space provides a complete local decorrelation between adjacent monte carlo configurations can easily be derived as follows .",
    "we remind the reader that , in a heat - bath monte carlo update , parameters are introduced to characterize a subspace of the configuration space in the neighborhood of the starting configuration , the dependence of the full boltzmann weight of the theory on these parameters is extracted ( from the full hamiltonian ) , and then new values for these parameters are then chosen ( independent of the original configuration ) on the basis of this boltzmann weight .",
    "in the situation considered here , the parameter space consists of a single discrete particle move variable @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 corresponding to no move , @xmath65 to a move along a specified link ) , and four continuous plaquette shift variables @xmath66 . for the indicated environment of the central link @xmath45 in fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquettes ] , the relevant part of the hamiltonian , as a function of @xmath67 and the continuous plaquette update variables @xmath68 , becomes @xmath69 where we have introduced a variable ( integer ) valence @xmath56 to take care of the case ( needed in the simulations of section 4 ) of multivalent ions . in order to implement a heat - bath procedure for this energy function , we need to generate values for the quintet @xmath70 distributed according to the boltzmann weight @xmath71 .",
    "fortunately , a complete analytic solution to this problem can easily be derived .",
    "first , we note that the energy function in eq .",
    "[ eq : hfunc ] can be reexpressed @xmath72 where @xmath73 i.e. the variables @xmath74 , @xmath75 are just the plaquette fields obtained by summing the electric link variables around each of the four plaquettes containing the central link of fig .

    "recently the problem of low acceptance rates for particle moves was noted by maggs et al .  in ref .  .",
    "they present an alternative solution to the problem where each charge , instead of residing on a single lattice site , is broken into pieces and resides on the lattice sites in an @xmath94x@xmath94x@xmath94 cube . in order to move a particle ,",
    "all of the pieces of the particle must be moved in unison .",
    "they have shown that the inverse temperature that they are able to simulate efficiently grows like @xmath95 using this method .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it is effective at increasing the acceptance rate and that the size of the cube can be chosen to give the desired acceptance rate .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is that the charges are spread out so that , for systems that are sensitive to the spatial location of the charges , the lattice must be made finer by a factor of @xmath94 in every direction to obtain the same charge locality as the lattice with unbroken particles . using the methods discussed in this work , the charges remain on a single lattice site so there are no difficulties arising from the breakup of the ions onto different lattice sites .",
    "to test these algorithms on a strongly charged system where correlation effects play a major role , we have considered a system of charged conducting plates with ions between the plates .",
    "while the system is electrically neutral , there is an osmotic pressure between the plates that depends on the electrostatic interaction between the particles and on the correlations between the particles .",
    "this system has been extensively studied both theoretically@xcite and numerically@xcite and is known to be a strongly fluctuating system within the parameter ranges in which we are interested .",
    "a convenient criterion@xcite for a strongly fluctuating system is that the bjerrum length , @xmath96 , times the square of the ion valence , @xmath56 , be smaller then the gouy - chapman length , @xmath17 . in the systems we are considering @xmath97",

    "our basic system consists of a 50x50x50 lattice with periodic boundary conditions in all three dimensions .",
    "positive charges are free to move on two fixed plates separated in the @xmath99 direction which extend the entire extent of the lattice in the @xmath100 and @xmath56 directions , while the region between the plates contains mobile counterions ensuring overall neutrality .",
    "the periodicity in the @xmath99 direction is not critical , as quantities observed are insensitive to field fluctuations far outside the plates .",
    "we choose a lattice spacing of 1  , so that we can study plate separations in the range of interest . using the dielectric constant of water ( @xmath101 ) and room temperature ( @xmath102 )",
    "gives a dimensionless inverse temperature @xmath103 , too large to effectively simulate with simple particle moves that do not adjust the electric field on neighboring plaquettes .",
    "we placed 34 positive univalent charges on each of the plates to give a surface - charge density of @xmath104 , approximately that used in references  .",
    "these charges are allowed to move during the simulation , but are not allowed to leave the plate . to make the system electrically neutral",
    ", 68 negatively charged ions are placed between the plates in the univalent case , and 34 negatively charged ions in the divalent case .",
    "two ions are forbidden from being on the same lattice site .",
    "the charges on the plates are initially randomly distributed on the plates , and the ions between the plates are initially distributed with half of the ions on the closest allowed plane to the right plate , and half on the closest allowed plane to the left plate .",
    "all runs are composed of 5,000 monte carlo equilibration steps followed by 20,000 measurement steps .",
    "each monte carlo step is composed of a coupled metropolis update of the electric field around each plaquette , ( 200 @xmath105 number of charges on the plates ) attempted moves of a particle on the plate chosen at random , and ( 20000 @xmath105 number of charges in solution ) attempted moves of a particle in solution .",
    "as pointed out by maggs et al.@xcite , a global update of the electric field is also included to ensure rigorous ergodicity .    to investigate the importance of the mobility of the charges on the plates we have also performed a set of simulations with the positive charges on plates fixed at a random initial distribution .",
    "there were no qualitative differences between the results of these simulations and the results of the simulations with mobile ions on the plates that we present here .    to investigate the errors due to lattice effects , we have also studied an asymmetric lattice where the lattice spacing is a factor of two smaller in the dimension separating the plates .",
    "this is a 100x50x50 asymmetric lattice with a lattice spacing of 0.5   in the @xmath99 direction so that the total volume of the system remains constant .",
    "two ions are again forbidden from being on the same lattice site . in the asymmetric case",
    "this corresponds to a different hard sphere interaction between the ions than in the symmetric lattice , but these differences are in practice unimportant , as the ions are so sparsely distributed that collision between ions are rare",
