    "it is now well understood that spontaneous emission of a quantum system depends crucially on the nature of the reservoir with which the system interacts .",
    "spontaneous emission can be modified in a `` tailored '' manner by changing the density of modes of the reservoir @xcite .",
    "an effective method to achieve this is to place atoms in waveguides @xcite , microcavities @xcite or photonic band gap materials @xcite , where the density of modes differs substantially from that of the free space vacuum .",
    "the latter has also attracted attention for its potential for modifying the absorption and dispersion properties of a system @xcite .    in the above studies the typical scheme involves the interaction of a two - level atom with a reservoir with modified density of modes .",
    "spontaneous emission of this two - level system differs considerably from the free space result and the usual weisskopf - wigner exponential decay @xcite is violated . in specific cases complete inhibition of spontaneous decay",
    "has even been predicted @xcite .",
    "in addition to studies of two - level atoms , there are also investigations of multi - level atoms , where the spontaneous emission from an atomic transition in the modified reservoir influences the spontaneous emission of another atomic transition that interacts with the normal free space vacuum @xcite .",
    "it is schemes such as these that concerns us in this article . specifically , we study two distinct multi - level atomic schemes where one transition is considered to decay spontaneously in a modified reservoir and the other decays to a normal free space vacuum .",
    "the main interest here is the existence of ` dark lines ' ( complete quenching of spontaneous emission for specific vacuum modes ) in the spontaneous emission spectrum of the _ free space _ transition due to the coupling of the other transition with the modified reservoir .",
    "we note that dark lines in spontaneous emission have been predicted in several laser driven schemes @xcite and have been experimentally observed @xcite . in this article",
    "we employ specific models for the modified reservoir density of modes , such as , for example , that which results from an isotropic photonic band gap model with ( or without ) defects . we show that dark lines appear in the spontaneous emission spectrum as a consequence of the structure of the modified reservoir .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in the next section we consider a three - level , @xmath0-type atomic system , with one transition spontaneously decaying in the normal free space vacuum and the other transition decaying in a modified reservoir .",
    "we study the spontaneous emission spectrum of the free space transition for four different density of modes of the modified reservoir and show that dark lines can occur in the spectrum due to the structure of the modified reservoir .",
    "we note that john and quang @xcite have studied the same atomic system as us , using specifically the appropriate density of modes obtained near the edge of an isotropic photonic band gap [ see eq .",
    "( [ isodom ] ) ] . however , in their study they focussed on the phenomenon of dynamical splitting in the spectrum and not on the existence dark lines , which is the main phenomenon discussed in our article .",
    "zeros and splittings in spectra should not be confused , although they relate to each other in the limit of strong coupling . in section iii",
    "we consider a laser - driven extension of the previous system and show that dark lines can occur in this system , too . in this case",
    "the dark lines originate from either laser - induced or modified vacuum - induced mechanisms .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section iv .",
    "we begin with the study of the @xmath0-type scheme , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",

    "the atom is assumed to be initially in state @xmath1 .",
    "the transition @xmath2 is taken to be near resonant with a modified reservoir ( this will be later referred to as the non - markovian reservoir ) , while the transition @xmath3 is assumed to be occurring in free space ( this will be later referred to as the markovian reservoir ) .",
    "the spectrum of this latter transition is of central interest in this article .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes the dynamics of this system , in the interaction picture and the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , is given by ( we use units such that @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 here , @xmath6 denotes the coupling of the atom with the modified vacuum modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 denotes the coupling of the atom with the free space vacuum modes @xmath9 .",
    "both coupling strengths are taken to be real .",
    "the energy separations of the states are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 is the energy of the @xmath13 @xmath9-th reservoir mode .",
    "the description of the system is given using a probability amplitude approach .",
    "we proceed by expanding the wave function of the system , at a specific time @xmath14 , in terms of the ` bare ' state vectors such that @xmath15 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ ham ] ) and ( [ wav ] ) into the time - dependent schrdinger equation we obtain @xmath16 we proceed by performing a formal time integration of eqs .",
    "( [ 2l ] ) and ( [ 2k ] ) and substitute the result into eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) to obtain the integro - differential equation @xmath17 because the reservoir with modes @xmath18 is assumed to be markovian , we can apply the usual weisskopf - wigner result @xcite and obtain @xmath19 note that the principal value term associated with the lamb shift which should accompany the decay rate has been omitted in eq .",

    "( [ 21a1 ] ) , reduces to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the laplace transform of @xmath33 , which yields @xmath34 therefore , in order to calculate the spontaneous emission spectrum in the markovian reservoir we need to calculate @xmath32 .",
    "this will be done for different models of the density of modes @xmath21 of the non - markovian reservoir .",

    "the spontaneous emission spectrum then reads @xmath40 obviously , the spectrum exhibits a zero ( i.e. predicts the existence of a dark line ) , if @xmath41 .",
    "this is purely an effect of the above density of states , and the non - markovian character of the reservoir . in the case of a markovian reservoir the spontaneous emission spectrum",
    "would obtain the well - known lorentzian profile and no dark line would appear in the spectrum .",
    "the behaviour of the spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for different values of the detuning from the threshold .",
    "the spectrum has two well - separated peaks and the dark line appears at the predicted value .",
    "we note that a spectrum of this form has also been derived by john and quang @xcite ; however , in their study they did not mention the existence of the dark line ( i.e. the zero in the spectrum and its spectral position ) , which is of central importance in this article .    the density of modes of eq .",
    "( [ isodom ] ) is a special case of a more general family of density of modes those given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is usually referred to as the smoothing parameter .",
    "such a density of modes has been used in studies of atoms in waveguides @xcite microcavities @xcite and photonic band gap materials @xcite .",

    "the only case for which spontaneous emission spectrum will give zero is that of @xmath46 and @xmath41 which , of course , reduces to the previous result of eq .",

    "( [ isodom ] ) , in this case too , there is a single dark line in the spectrum at @xmath41 .",
    "however , the behaviour of the spectrum is quite different in this case compared to that shown in fig .",

    "[ fig7 ] , where only a single dark line appears in the spectrum at @xmath79 , as @xmath80 .    in the case of an isotropic photonic band gap with a defect with delta function density of modes",

    "in this article we have investigated the spontaneous emission properties of two distinct atomic models with one transition coupling to a markovian reservoir while another transition coupling to a non - markovian reservoir .",
