    "nuclear modifications of hadron production in high - energy collisions have been observed in both deep inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering ( ndis ) @xcite and in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "one typically observes : ( i ) a suppression of hadron multiplicities , called hadron quenching or jet quenching ; ( ii ) hadron transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) broadening ; ( iii ) the related modification of the hadron @xmath0-spectrum also known as cronin effect .",
    "the nuclear modifications can be attributed to the interactions of the scattered partons and of the hadrons formed in their fragmentation with the surrounding medium .",
    "experimentally , partonic in - medium interactions can be isolated by studying drell - yan ( dy ) lepton pair production in hadron - nucleus collisions . in ndis and hadron - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the medium is the nuclear target itself , also called `` cold nuclear matter '' . in nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    ", the fragmenting parton must also traverse the hot and dense medium created in the collisions , be it a hadron gas at low energy , or a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at high energy .",
    "this medium is also called `` hot nuclear matter '' .",
    "a precise knowledge of parton propagation and hadronization mechanisms obtained from ndis and dy data is essential for testing and calibrating our theoretical tools , and to determine the properties of the qgp produced at the relativistic heavy ion collider .",
    "conversely , a well known nuclear medium like a target nucleus allows testing the hadronization mechanism and color confinement dynamics in ndis .",
    "knowledge of partonic in - medium propagation gained from ndis , can be used in dy scatterings to factor out parton energy loss and measure the nuclear modifications of parton distributions in the initial state @xcite .",
    "finally , hadron quenching is an important source of systematic uncertainty in neutrino oscillation experiments such as minos , which use nuclear targets and need to reconstruct the event s kinematic from the hadronic final state @xcite",
    ".     created at time 0 in a hard collision turns into a colored prehadron @xmath1 , which subsequently neutralizes its color , @xmath2 , and collapses on the wave function of the observed hadron @xmath3 . ]",
    "understanding and modeling nuclear modifications of hadron production requires knowledge of the space - time evolution of the hadronization process @xcite .",
    "however , hadronization is a non perturbative process , and its theoretical understanding is still in its infancy : one has to resort to phenomenological models to describe its space - time evolution @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a few features can be expected on general grounds .",
    "a parton created in a high - energy collision can travel as a free particle only for a limited time because of color confinement : it has to dress - up in a color - field of loosely bound partons , which eventually will evolve into the observed hadron wave function . while the naked , asymptotically free , parton has a negligible inelastic cross section with the surrounding medium constituents , the dressed parton is likely to develop an inelastic cross section of the order of the hadronic one .",
    "hence , the dressed parton will be subject to nuclear absorption in a similar way a fully formed hadron is .",
    "for this reason , it is usually called `` prehadron '' , and denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the prehadron may for some time be in a colored state , @xmath1 , because color neutrality is only required for the final state hadron .",
    "however , it is likely to neutralize its color before hadron formation , and the colorless prehadron is denoted @xmath2 .",
    "we can therefore identify 3 relevant time scales , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hadrosketch ] : ( 1 ) the `` prehadron production time '' or `` quark lifetime '' @xmath5 , at which the dressed quark develops a sizable inelastic cross section , ( 2 ) the `` color neutralization time '' @xmath6 , at which gluon bremsstrahlung stops , and ( 3 ) the `` hadron formation time '' @xmath7 , at which the final hadron is formed .    for practical applications",
    ", hadronization is generally pictured as a 2 step process in which the prehadron production time and color neutralization time are identified , @xmath8 .",
    "this is a somewhat crude approximation of the more complex process sketched above , but is adequate to the present status of the theoretical and experimental investigation and will be used in this paper .    in summary ,",
    "the key quantity we need to investigate in order to understand this complex dynamics is the hadronization time scale , @xmath5 .",
    "it is the most general information about the space - time evolution of the hadronization process which can be extracted from experimental data .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to provide a semi - quantitative and model independent estimate of the prehadron production time from recent preliminary data on the @xmath0-broadening taken by the hermes  experiment in lepton - nucleus scatterings at the hera accelerator @xcite .",
    "these data show rich features in terms of their dependence on the kinematic variables , which are confirmed by preliminary data taken by the clas  experiment at jefferson lab @xcite , and are not always simple to interpret theoretically .",
    "i will show to what extent a consistent picture of the space - time evolution of hadronization can be inferred from these data , and how they are beginning to expose the limits of current theoretical modeling of this process .",
    "hadron quenching in ndis is studied in terms of the multiplicity ratio @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the yield of semi - inclusive hadrons in a given kinematic bin , and @xmath11 the yield of inclusive scattered leptons in the same ( @xmath12,@xmath13)-bin . the kinematic variables @xmath14 , @xmath12 , @xmath15 , @xmath13 are the usual dis invariants , namely , the hadron fractional energy , the virtual photon energy , the hadron transverse momentum and the lepton 4-momentum transfer squared .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it is conjectured that @xmath16 should not depend on @xmath14 and @xmath12 separately but should depend on a combination of them : @xmath17 \\ ,   \\label{eq : rmscaling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the scaling variable @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 the scaling exponent @xmath20 can be obtained by a best fit analysis of data or theoretical computations .",
    "obviously , the proportionality constant @xmath21 can not be determined by the fit . a possible",
    "scaling of @xmath16 with @xmath13 is not considered because of its model dependence , and because of the mild dependence of hermes @xmath16 data on @xmath13 . as discussed below , the proposed functional form of @xmath18 , eq .  ,",
    "is flexible enough to encompass both absorption models , which assume short production times and in - medium hadronization , and energy loss models , which assume long lived quarks with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the nuclear radius .",
    "the 2 classes of models are distinguished by the value of the scaling exponent : a positive @xmath24 is characteristic of absorption models , while a negative @xmath25 is characteristic of energy loss models .",
    "thus , the exponent @xmath20 extracted from experimental data can identify the leading mechanism for hadron suppression in ndis , and distinguish short from long hadronization time scales .",
    "the scaling of @xmath16 is quite natural in the context of hadron absorption models @xcite .",
    "indeed , prehadron absorption depends on the in - medium prehadron path length , which depends on the prehadron production time @xmath26 , as long as @xmath27 . in the lund string model",
    "@xcite hadronization is modeled by the breaking of the color string stretching from the struck parton to the target remnant .",
    "the production time is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the struck quark energy , and @xmath30 the string tension . at leading order ( lo ) in the strong coupling constant @xmath31 ,",
    "the partonic subprocess is @xmath32 and one obtains @xmath33 the factor @xmath34 can be understood as a lorentz boost factor .",
    "the @xmath35 factor is due to energy conservation : a high-@xmath14 hadron carries away an energy @xmath36 ; the string remainder has a small energy @xmath37 and can not stretch farther than @xmath38 .",
    "thus the string breaking must occur on a time scale proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "the function @xmath40 is a small deformation of @xmath26 , which can be computed analytically in the standard lund model @xcite .",
    "the main features of the estimate are dictated by kinematics and 4-momentum conservation , hence are of general nature .",
    "indeed they can be obtained also by perturbative considerations based on the uncertainty principle , similarly to what is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , or in the perturbative hadronization model of ref .",
    "the production time is well described by the proposed scaling variable @xmath18 with @xmath41 .",
    "e.g. , in the lund model @xmath42 @xcite . in energy loss models @xcite , which assume @xmath22 , the scaling is less obvious and holds only approximately on a theoretical ground .",
    "when performing the scaling analysis of the full energy loss models , one finds in general @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the central result of the analysis of hermes data at @xmath44 gev performed in ref .",
    "@xcite is that pion data clearly exhibit @xmath45 as discussed , this is a signal of in - medium prehadron formation , with production times @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the scaling variable @xmath18 can be identified with the average production time : @xmath47 the proportionality constant @xmath21 in eq .",
    ", hence the magnitude of the production time , will be estimated in section  [ sec : discussion - ptbroad ] .",
    "a similar analysis has been attempted in ref .",
    "@xcite , but arbitrarily fixing @xmath48 .",
    "the resulting @xmath49 shows a rough scaling , with the 2 lowest-@xmath14 data point in each data set deviating from the scaling curve and aligning in the vertical direction .",
    "this breaking of the scaling behavior is more probably due to the particular choice of @xmath20 , rather than to rescattering effects as argued by the authors .",
    "the scaling analysis just described gives only indirect evidence for a short production time @xmath26 , and can not measure its absolute scale .",
    "an observable which is more directly related to the prehadron production time , and allows an estimate of the coefficient @xmath21 in eq .  , is the hadron s transverse momentum broadening in dis on a nuclear target compared to a proton or deuteron target @xcite , @xmath50 when a hadron is observed in the final state , neither the quark nor the prehadron from which it originates could have had inelastic scatterings .",
    "since the prehadron - nucleon elastic cross section is very small compared to the quark cross section , the hadron s @xmath0-broadening originates dominantly during parton propagation .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the quark s momentum broadening @xmath51 is proportional to the quark path - length in the nucleus .",
    "if the prehadron production time has the form as argued in the last section , and as long as the prehadron is formed inside the nucleus , we obtain @xmath52 where the exponent 0.5 is determined by the scaling analysis discussed in section [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "then , a decrease of @xmath53 with increasing @xmath14 or decreasing @xmath12 would be a clear signal of in - medium prehadron formation : indeed , if the quark were traveling through the whole nucleus before prehadron formation , @xmath53 would only depend on the nucleus size and not on @xmath14 or @xmath12 .",
    "in addition to the dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath14 and @xmath12 , which primarily stems from energy conservation and the lorentz boost of the hadron , ref .",
    "@xcite argues that @xmath54 the physics behind this proposed behavior is that a quark which is struck by a photon of large virtuality radiates more intensely than for a lower virtuality : as a consequence , it will be able to only travel a shorter way before hadronization , hence it will experience less @xmath0-broadening .",
    "a related observable is the cronin effect , which is likewise expected to decrease with increasing @xmath14 or decreasing @xmath12 , and possibly with increasing @xmath13 @xcite .",
    ", but for the @xmath55-broadening as a function of @xmath14 ( upper panel ) , @xmath12 ( middle panel ) , and q@xmath56 ( lower panel ) .",

    "[ fig : hermesptbroad_a ] and [ fig : hermesptbroad_znuq2 ] for the reader s convenience , show a linear increase with @xmath57 , and a clear decrease of @xmath51 at large @xmath14 consistent with eq .   and",
    "hermes data on the cronin effect @xcite .",
    "however , hermes data also show a clearly increasing @xmath58 with @xmath59 gev@xmath56 , at variance with the @xmath13 dependence of the prehadron production time obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and with string models in general .",
    "they also show an increase of @xmath60 with @xmath61 tending to saturate at @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the flat , or even slightly decreasing dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath12 is also , at first sight , not easily interpreted in the context of eq .   and the simple hadronization picture used so far .",
    ".average hermes kinematics for the @xmath0-broadening results @xcite . in parenthesis , beside the target nucleus symbol is the average in - medium path length of the hadronizing system @xmath63 , with @xmath64 .",
    "the production time is computed according to eq .  .",
    "the average @xmath65 is very well approximated by @xmath66 @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is also important to extend as much as possible the range in @xmath61 over which the @xmath0-broadening is measured : at small @xmath67 the nlo photon - gluon fusion is the dominant partonic process , while at @xmath68 the photon dominantly scatters at lo valence quarks .",
    "hence , with mechanism number 2 , one may expect @xmath51 to flat in @xmath13 in these 2 regions .",
    "a last question needs to be addressed : how do the hermes data and these scenarios compare to preliminary clas data @xcite on the @xmath0-broadening and cronin effect ?    at clas , the higher beam luminosity allows multidimensional binning which is only partly accessible at hermes .",
    "the kinematics is a bit different due to the lower beam energy , @xmath69 gev compared to 27 gev .",
    "the main difference is that @xmath70 gev is much smaller than at hermes , therefore prehadron production should typically happen on shorter time scales , mainly inside the nucleus according to the estimate",
    ". note also that @xmath71 gev@xmath56 , and that , typically , @xmath72 .",
    "the main features of clas data on c , fe , and pb targets are the following :    * the @xmath0-broadening is linear in @xmath57 at low @xmath73 , but tends to saturate for large nuclei . the flattening is confirmed by the lack of increase in the cronin effect from the fe target to the pb target .",
    "this shows the prehadron being formed on a time scale @xmath74 fm , smaller than at hermes .",
    "* the @xmath0-broadening is rising and then saturating with @xmath12 .",
    "the saturation appears at @xmath75 gev , where the hermes @xmath0 is also approximately flat . *",
    "the cronin effect decreases with @xmath14 as it happens at hermes .",
    "* the cronin effect markedly increases as @xmath61 increases from 0.1 to 0.5 .",
    "this confirms the @xmath61 dependence of hermes  @xmath0-broadening .",
    "all these features corroborate the discussed hermes data . however , the production time i have estimated is about a factor 5 smaller than the production time extracted in ref .",
    "@xcite from clas @xmath12-distributions using the color dipole formalism @xcite . on the other hand , based on this paper s analysis , and taking into account the uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath76 , hermes data can only support up to a doubling of @xmath5 , which would otherwise become incompatible with the large-@xmath14 decrease of the @xmath0-broadening .",
    "the hermes  and clas  data sets may be qualitatively reconciled by taking into account the observed increase of the @xmath0-broadening with @xmath65 discussed in the previous section .",
    "indeed , @xmath77 , which implies a larger @xmath0-broadening at clas .    the origin of the discrepancy between the production times extracted from hermes and clas data on the @xmath0-broadening remains to be clarified . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the two discussed methods to determine the production time should be applied to both data sets , in order to check their consistency and further explore the issue . on the experimental side",
    ", it is very important to establish and study the correlation of @xmath51 with @xmath61 and @xmath13 , as emphasized in the previous section .",
    "in this paper , i attempted a semi - quantitative estimate of the prehadron production time , based on recent preliminary hermes  data on hadron @xmath0-broadening in nuclear dis , see eq .  .",
    "the obtained production time can well explain the dependence of the @xmath0-broadening on @xmath73 , @xmath14 and @xmath12 .",
    "its linear increase with @xmath13 remains a challenge to current theoretical models , and i proposed a few mechanisms that may contribute to its explanation , also suggesting how to experimentally validate them .",
    "furthermore , i discussed how the preliminary clas  data qualitatively support the features observed at hermes .    with the obtained estimate of @xmath5 ,",
    "the prehadrons at hermes   are typically formed around the nuclear surface or slightly outside , while at clas  they are typically formed inside the target . however , a quantitative analysis indicate that @xmath78 .",
    "the observed @xmath61 dependence of the @xmath0-broadening can at least in part reconcile the 2 data sets , as well as explain the @xmath13 dependence of the data .",
    "it also points at a non - negligible role of nlo processes in the hadronization process .",
    "the measurement of hadron @xmath0-broadening , and the related cronin effect , are beginning to test the limits of current theory models on the space - time evolution of hadronization , which are based on lo @xmath79-quark scattering , followed by color neutralization of the quark and hadron formation .",
    "the main theoretical challenges raised by these data are , in my opinion ,    * the inclusion of nlo processes in the modeling of hadron quenching . * the implementation at lo , and subsequently at nlo , of alternative models of energy loss , like a medium - modified dglap evolution ; * testing of alternative space - time pictures beyond the 2 time scale models currently accepted ; for example , the role of a colored prehadron should be explored .      *",
    "the role of parton energy loss can be highlighted by large-@xmath12/small-@xmath14 cuts , such that the parton lifetime exceeds the nuclear size ; * in - medium hadronization can be selected by small-@xmath12/large-@xmath14 cuts ; * the @xmath61 dependence of @xmath51 , the cronin effect , and the multiplicity ratio needs to be better studied over a large interval of @xmath61 , including small @xmath80 and large @xmath81 ; additionally , dihadron correlations and the hadron multiplicity per event as a function of @xmath61 can more directly reveal the role of nlo processes , in which 2 partons can be produced at the hard scattering ; * the combined analysis of @xmath0-broadening s @xmath61-distributions binned in @xmath13 and of @xmath13-distributions binned in @xmath61 is likely to usefully expose the underlying dynamics .    because of the available @xmath12 range , the hermes  experiment and the future electron - ion collider are best suited to study the role of parton energy loss and propagation in cold nuclear matter . at clas ,",
    "in - medium hadronization is likely to be dominant and can be studied in detail thanks to its high - statistics data , which allow multidimensional binning and the study of one kinematic variable at a time .",
