    "<S> in recent years , an extensive survey on various wave equations of relativistic quantum mechanics with different types of potential interactions has been a line of great interest . in this regime , special attention has been given to the dirac equation because the spin-1/2 fermions represent the most frequent building blocks of the molecules and atoms . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the considerable interest in this equation and its relativistic symmetries ( spin and pseudospin ) in the presence of solvable potential model , we attempt to obtain the relativistic bound states solution of the dirac equation with double ring - shaped kratzer and oscillator potentials under the condition of spin and pseudospin symmetries . the solutions are reported for arbitrary quantum number in a compact form . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic bound state energy eigenvalues and the associated upper- and lower - spinor components of two dirac particles have been found . </S>",
    "<S> several typical numerical results of the relativistic eigenenergies have also been presented . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the existence or absence of the ring shaped potential potential has strong effects on the eigenstates of the kratzer and oscillator particles with a wide band spectrum except for the pseudospin - oscillator particles where there exist a narrow band gap .    </S>",
