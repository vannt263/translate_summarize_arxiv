    "the study of dynamical systems interacting with an external environment plays an essential role in classical and quantum physics , since long - term properties of any system are going to be affected by the outside world unless complete adiabaticity can be assumed at all times .",
    "in particular , the presence of environments having the energy of their constituent particles shared according to the boltzmann distribution , also named ` baths ' , is at the basis of the canonical ensemble approach in equilibrium statistical mechanics , with its large variety of physical implications .",
    "a microscopic analysis of the system - bath interplay is possible by writing explicitly the bath degrees of freedom and integrating out their effect on the target particle . along these lines ,",
    "various authors have determined sufficient conditions under which a langevin dynamics , and the consequent thermalization , holds .",
    "this has been achieved by considering a bath made of non - interacting harmonic oscillators , which interact linearly with the target particle , the so - called caldeira - leggett model @xcite .",
    "more recently , studies have focused attention on baths endowed with finite resources , such as a finite number of harmonic oscillators distributed in a finite bandwidth , _",
    "i.e. _ allowing for a non - zero infrared cut - off and a finite ultraviolet cut - off @xcite .",
    "in particular , the dynamics of a target harmonic oscillator interacting via a linear and translationally invariant term with a bath , composed of a finite number of harmonic oscillators whose frequencies are all in a limited range , was studied in detail .",
    "the principal outcome of this analysis , presented in @xcite , can be summarized as follows . to ensure thermalization",
    ", the frequency of the test particle must lie within the band of bath frequencies , which in turn must also have a large enough bandwidth . in the absence of any one of these conditions",
    "the test particle does not thermalize to the temperature of the bath .",
    "the implication of this is either that the energy distribution is not amenable to a boltzmann distribution or that the resulting effective temperature of the test particle is significantly different from that of the bath .",
    "thermalization plays a crucial role in sympathetic cooling of atomic species trapped in magnetic or optical potentials .",
    "this was first demonstrated experimentally when @xmath0rb , a bosonic rubidium isotope which is hard to cool using evaporating techniques , was successfully cooled via thermal contact with @xmath1rb @xcite .",
    "the technique is even more crucial in the case of fermionic atomic species where direct evaporative cooling loses its efficiency in the degenerate regime due to fundamental limitations arising from the pauli principle @xcite .",
    "a number of studies have led to predictions for new phase transitions occurring for ultracold fermions in single traps or optical lattices , and the current experimental focus is on achieving temperatures low enough to observe these effects @xcite .    the caldeira - leggett model , in its original form ,",
    "can not be used to describe thermalization in the atomic physics framework . in its applications to solid - state systems , this model is meaningful due to the multiplicity of normal modes associated with lattice vibrations and the need for a continuous density of states , as in the debye model @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in atom traps no phonon - mediated interactions exist in principle either in single traps or in optical lattices .",
    "thus coolant and target species both have single values for the trapping frequencies which means that , based on the caldeira - leggett model , no thermalization is expected .",
    "this is further heightened in those proposals where the two species are deliberately required to have significantly different trapping frequencies in order to optimize sympathetic cooling @xcite .",
    "of course , this inference is in stark contrast to the experimentally observed success of sympathetic cooling in a range of atomic mixtures .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that it is possible to choose bath - test particle interactions which reconcile the caldeira - leggett model with the experimentally manifest effectiveness of sympathetic cooling .",
    "the details of the dynamics of thermalization is studied as well in terms of the stability with respect to different choices of the model parameters .",
    "the model we discuss is purely classical , both in regard to the dynamical evolution and to the choice of boltzmann heat baths . while classical dynamics is generally consider sufficient to describe the motion of ultracold atoms under current experimental conditions , in the quantum degenerate regime the boltzmann energy distribution should be superseded by bose or fermi distributions .",
    "this work should be therefore considered as a prelude , in the dulong - petit classical limit , to the analysis of fully degenerate ultracold quantum gases , setting the stage and the language for future work aimed at a more comprehensive analysis of dynamical situations such as the sympathetic cooling of bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce two interaction hamiltonians differing in their selectivity with respect to the relative velocity of the interacting particles , and we make explicit the hamilton s equations and associated considerations . in section iii",
    "we discuss an interesting phenomenon which occurs in the strong coupling limit of repulsive interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ the fact that the test particle experiences an effective double - well potential which influences the dynamics of cooling . this is demonstrated both through numerical and approximate fixed point analyses , which then results in a phase diagram delineating various regimes in the parameter space .",
    "section iv presents the results of numerical simulations showing the approach to thermal equilibrium and the relaxation dynamics in terms of the interaction energy . in the process , we revisit some assumptions implicit in discussions of thermalization , which are not necessarily satisfied in models like ours . in the conclusions ,",
    "we discuss the relevance of this model to actual simulations of ultracold atomic mixtures , as well as several directions for expanding the applicability of our models .",
    "a particular point of interest is the possible application of recent results on shortcuts to adiabaticity for hastening the rate of thermalization in our dynamical models .",
    "the classical hamiltonian for a 1d harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath2 and angular frequency @xmath3 , which we will refer to as a test particle , in the presence of a bath made of @xmath4 harmonic oscillators of mass @xmath5 and generic frequency @xmath6 $ ] linearly coupled to it , is written as    @xmath7.\\ ] ]    the associated hamilton equations are @xmath8 these show that the effect of the bath on the test particle leads to a modified spring constant ( which can also be viewed as a combined change in mass and frequency ) such that @xmath9 , and in an effective force equal to @xmath10 , where the latter depends on the bath dynamics . if the bath oscillators all have the same frequency then the driving force is simply proportional to @xmath11 , which averages to zero for a large number of bath oscillators with uniform distribution of initial conditions in phase space .",
    "this precludes any exchange of net energy between the bath and the test particle .",
    "this implies that thermalization relies on and requires the existence of a large number of distinct frequencies for the bath oscillators . as such , atoms oscillating in a harmonic trap with a common angular frequency , @xmath12 ,",
    "do not fall within the caldeira - leggett framework . to address thermalization in this specific situation , the interaction between the test particle and the bath particles needs to be modified , and we will consider a hamiltonian of the generic form    @xmath13    given our motivation , the first distinctive requirement in @xmath14 is that interactions between atoms be highly localized in configuration space , being described either by pseudopotentials with zero range or by finite range ( dipolar ) interactions .",
    "locality of the bath - test particle interaction , first introduced to our knowledge in the context of a microscopic description of a measurement apparatus @xcite , is easily achieved by introducing a spatial filter , for instance of a gaussian nature .",
    "this implies an interaction hamiltonian of the generic form    @xmath15.\\ ] ]    thus the test particle - bath interaction hamiltonian is dependent on two parameters , the coupling strength @xmath16 and the range @xmath17 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is basically negligible if @xmath18 .",
    "the generic function @xmath19 is chosen to fulfill galilean invariance , as reflected in the explicit dependence on the differences between the coordinates and velocities of the involved particles , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "for the remainder of our analysis , we will contrast two forms of the function @xmath19 .",
    "the first is where @xmath19 is constant , which is a velocity - independent situation , while the second choice takes @xmath19 to be a quadratic function of the relative velocity .",
    "having in mind applications in the atomic physics arena , the coupling strength @xmath16 should eventually be related to the scattering length in the case of pseudopotentials .",
    "examples of these are the zero - range approximation usually adopted in the gross - pitaevskii equation for bose gases ( in which case @xmath17 is chosen to be zero ) , or to the van der waals potential in the case of finite - range interactions as in dipolar gases .",
    "of the various possibilities available for the function @xmath19 , the simplest is a constant value , that is @xmath22 \\;.\\ ] ]    here a significant impulsive force occurs at each interaction between the test particle and a particle of the bath if they are within a distance of order of @xmath17 of each other .",
    "the strength of the interaction is controlled by the parameter @xmath23 which has the dimensions of energy and sets the maximal possible energy exchange during the interaction , which is achieved in the limit @xmath24 , a sort of force kick of constant amplitude .",
    "the sign of @xmath23 determines the attractive ( @xmath25 ) or repulsive ( @xmath26 ) character of the interaction , as in the former case the interaction energy is minimized at the smallest distances , and this trend is reversed in the latter situation .",
    "the corresponding hamilton equations of motion are @xmath27(q_n - q)\\;,\\\\ \\dot{q}_n&=&\\frac{p_n}{m } \\ ; , \\\\ \\dot{p}_n&=&-m\\omega^2",

    "notice that , even if the bath particles and the test particle are initially chosen with degenerate frequencies and same masses , their interaction produces a relative frequency shift . also , for comparable parameters @xmath34 , the harmonic trap becomes unstable when @xmath35 , beyond which the local effective potential seen by the test particle near the origin is that of an inverted harmonic oscillator .",
    "the overall effective potential then morphs into an ( attractive ) quartic potential at larger values of @xmath36 , as shown by further expanding the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ exponentapprox ] ) to fourth order in @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the effective dynamics for the repulsive @xmath26 case is one of a double - well for @xmath37 .",
    "no such instability occurs around the origin for negative values of @xmath23 , corresponding to attractive interactions .    in the opposite limit of small @xmath17 , at any given time the bath decouples into a subsystem of @xmath38 interacting oscillators , which are within range @xmath17 of the test particle , while the remaining @xmath39 bath particles are irrelevant to the dynamics .",
    "the average number of oscillators @xmath40 of the heat bath interacting at any given time with the test particle may be estimated in a stationary regime once we evaluate the oscillation amplitude of the generic oscillator @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total energy of the @xmath43 particle .",
    "the equipartition theorem provides the estimate @xmath44 , so that average oscillation amplitude of a generic particle of the heat bath is @xmath45 , and its motion will span an interval of coordinate values @xmath46 $ ] , while the test particle has a interaction range of @xmath47 . considering uniform distributions over the ranges , this suggests that the number of oscillators @xmath48 , meaning an inverse dependence on the temperature of the heat bath .",
    "the form assumed above for the hamiltonian is the simplest one possible and we can , as more appropriate for collisional interactions , incorporate a dependence on the velocities of the test particle and each particle in the heat bath .",
    "we continue to assume , as in the previous case , a local spatial interaction and the interaction hamiltonian is now given by @xmath49.\\ ] ]    this velocity - selective hamiltonian now corresponds to a force which depends on the velocity mismatch .",
    "our choice is reminiscent of the fact that the elastic scattering rate between atoms is proportional to the relative velocity between the colliding particles , provided they are in close proximity to feel deviations from the original trajectory through van der waals like forces . in this case",

    "( 13,14 ) , of forces proportional to the square of the velocity difference resembles dissipation - like behavior .",
    "this should be expected to make the energy exchange between the test particles and the bath particles occur on shorter timescales when contrasted with the velocity - independent case where the dissipative feature is lacking .",
    "we note here that a more generic interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath54.\\ ] ] can be written where @xmath55 is a parameter related to the velocity spread in the particle ensembles .",

    "what is shown is for a single target particle interacting with a set of bath oscillators .",
    "these relations can be readily extended to the more general situation of @xmath59 test particle oscillators interacting with @xmath4 oscillators of the heat bath , as in the subsequent simulations described in section iv .",
    "the advantage of this more general situation is that the effective temperature of the test particles can be obtained at any time by looking at the energy distribution of the test particle ensemble , rather than taking a finite sequence of energies in a given time interval , a procedure followed in @xcite .",
    "this allows for a more accurate tracking of the time evolution of the temperature , and therefore of the expected thermalization dynamics .",
    "besides , the interaction of two clouds of particles is more appropriate to sympathetic cooling which is an important motivation for this work .",
    "the analysis thus far , for both forms of the interaction , indicate that there are parameter regimes where the thermalization we are interested in may in fact not occur .",

    "[ fig3 ] readily suggest the role the effective number of bath oscillators interacting with each target particle , @xmath140 , plays in promoting thermalization . contrasting panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the interaction range @xmath17 has been increased but the time can then been decreased to get the effective temperatures to be the same .",
    "plot ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the effect of the velocity dependent interaction at shorter times , and implies temperature oscillations in the early stage of thermalization .",
    "the oscillatory phenomenon is more clearly seen by considering the time dependence of the interaction energy , defined as @xmath141}$ ] in the case of velocity - independent interactions . as shown in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for both interaction types , there is a sharp decrease in this measure to essentially a quasi - stationary value , with the inset emphasizing the energy oscillations at early times .",
    "the velocity - dependent case shows more quasi - periodicity than in the velocity - independent situation .",
    "( black , bottom curve ) and @xmath142 ( red , top curve ) , with @xmath143 ( a ) and @xmath144 ( b ) , where the latter parameter was intentionally chosen to have comparable final interaction energy in the two situations .",

    "all other parameters are chosen as in fig . 3 , and both time ( in steps ) and energies are expressed in arbitrary units.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the observant reader will also notice that in fig .",
    "3(c ) the final inverse temperatures of both bath and target subsystems are lower than the initial values , implying heating of both species . to explore the dynamics of thermalization more clearly , and in particular this double heating effect",
    ", we consider the time dependence of the effective temperatures of bath and target subsystems .",
    "based on what we deduced earlier , thermalization should occur faster in the case with larger @xmath17 , irrespective of the nature of the interaction , and relatively quicker for the velocity - dependent interaction .",
    "the latter expectation is trickier to show numerically as equivalent parameter regimes for the two cases are hard to determine .",
    "this is readily seen from the parameter phase diagrams shown earlier .",
    "however , as seen from contrasting figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , where three cases for each interaction type is shown , the qualititative features are very similar . in each figure , what is shown is ( a ) where thermalization does not occur even at the longest time considered ; ( b ) where there are clear signs that thermalization is occurring and ( c ) an anomalous situation where the final temperatures for both bath and target are higher than their initial values . figures  [ fig5](a ) and ( b ) ( and their equivalents in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) clearly show that the temporal scale for relaxation decreases on increasing the spatial region of interaction ( increasing @xmath17 ) .",
    "this in turn implies faster equilibration due to the increase in the average number of interacting particles at any given time .",
    "we now turn to the anomalous situation seen in both figs .",
    "[ fig5](c ) and  [ fig6](c ) .",
    "this occurs , for certain initial configurations , when a large amount of interaction energy is initially present in the system , typically in the large @xmath23 or @xmath50 limit where we will have @xmath145 .",
    "this is a distinctive feature of our approach , as usually any initial interaction energy or initial correlation between two subsystems is assumed to be nearly negligible with respect to the internal energy of the subsystems .",
    "this last situation is however characteristic of solid state systems , in which the contact between two bodies is limited to their surfaces , and it is therefore marginal with respect to the internal energy of the bodies .",
    "here instead the two bodies are penetrating , as atoms of the two different species see each other in the whole available trapping volume .",
    "clearly this is outside the usual view of systems in thermal contact where the interface plays no role in the thermalization process .",
    "here it does and , given the excess energy content , can heat both the systems as if there is a fictitious third , hotter subsystem in the problem , or if the interaction energy acts as a sort of latent heat released during the time evolution .",
    "of course this initial interaction energy can also be minimized , even at a relatively large value of @xmath23 or @xmath50 , by tactically choosing the initial conditions in such a way that the oscillators of the two systems are very close to each other ( in the case of attractive interactions ) or very far apart ( in the case of repulsive interactions ) .",
    "likewise , the sudden change in the interaction between the two subsystems , for instance by exploiting feshbach resonances of the interspecies scattering length , allows for implosions or explosions of the atomic clouds , as in the bosenova effect @xcite .",
    "all these situations are in principle covered by our simulation technique by properly choosing initial conditions for the bath particles and/or time - dependent interactions couplings .    regarding the thermalization timescale and its dependence upon the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath50 , and @xmath17 , the plots in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] show that the thermalization time is inversely proportional to the interaction strength as intuitively expected .",
    "this can be confirmed by a semiquantitative analysis at least in the simpler case of velocity independent interactions . by visual inspection of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 7 ) , the two relevant timescales for the test particle are the intrinsic one of its free oscillation ( the period of oscillation @xmath146 ) and a _ response _ time to the force due to any single oscillator of the bath , @xmath147^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "thus , the thermalization timescale , proportional to @xmath148 varies with the coupling strength as @xmath149 . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) and ( c ) , corresponding to the same @xmath17 with coupling strengths @xmath23 differing by a factor 5 , the crossing between the two curves corresponding to the weighted fits for the inverse temperature occurs at times in the approximate ratio of 2 ( @xmath150 time steps for the case in ( b ) , @xmath151 times steps in ( c ) ) .",
    "a similar analysis is unfortunately not possible for the dependence of the thermalization time upon the interaction range @xmath17 .",
    "a naive extension of the argument above indicates a response time increasing linearly with @xmath17 , which defies physical intuition as in this case more and more oscillators interact with the test particle .",
    "this , in fact , is precisely the issue as @xmath148 introduced above does not take into account the number of interacting oscillators from the bath , _",
    "i.e. _ the sum term in eq .",
    "( 7 ) which also grows with @xmath17 .",
    "numerically , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show that increasing @xmath17 speeds up thermalization . due to the complicated structure of the hamilton equations for the velocity - dependent case",
    ", the above analysis can not be repeated , however the results shown in fig .  [ fig6 ] confirms the same trends in this case .",
    "also , notice that the onset of a quasi - stationary regime for the interaction energy in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] appears to coincide with the thermalization timescales in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , suggesting that the former may act as a shortcut to study the relaxation to thermal equilibrium or at least to steady states .",
    "finally , we show in fig .",
    "7 the long time behavior in the velocity - independent case , both for the evolution of the inverse temperatures ( left panel ) as well as the interaction energy ( right panel ) .",
    "we note that not only do the timescales for thermalization at very short times coincide for these two observables , corroborating the remark made in the previous sentence , but also that their long - time behavior seem to exhibit fluctuations of similar relative amplitude .",
    "further , fig .",
    "7(a ) confirms that the crossing of the inverse temperatures clearly visible at shorter times ( in both figs .",
    "5(b ) and ( c ) ) is a temporary feature , leading to a stabilization of the temperatures for later times .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the thermalization dynamics of atoms trapped in a confining potential under the action of another gas with a generic temperature and different trapping frequency .",
    "the analysis has been carried out through molecular dynamics simulations adapting the caldeira - leggett model to the specific context of atoms oscillating at well - defined frequencies in a harmonic trap .",
    "the nonlinear form of the interaction between the two atomic species required an assessment of the dynamical stability which limits the range of the parameters of the model for enabling efficient thermalization .",
    "our numerical analysis does not rely on the weak - coupling assumption typically underlying the application of the caldeira - leggett model to open systems .",
    "a manifest implication of this more generalized framework is the fact that in the strong coupling regime the very definition of boltzmann equilibrium distribution is at stake , and then only _ effective _ temperatures can be defined .",
    "this is in line with former analyses in the context of chemical physics , as in @xcite in which the preservation of the boltzmann distribution is ensured only in a weak interaction regime , and therefore fails for strongly exothermic chemical reactions ( for a discussion of the strong coupling regime in open quantum systems , with similar outcomes in terms of lack of thermalization , see @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations have been performed for a purely classical setting which , in terms of atomic clouds , seem justified whenever the sample temperature @xmath152 fulfils the condition @xmath153 , as usual in atomic trapping even at the lowest explored temperatures .",
    "quantum effects will however influence the thermalization dynamics at finite temperature through the deviations from the classical dulong - petit specific heat law , which could be incorporated in the molecular dynamics code @xcite .",
    "in particular , this affects the dynamics of thermalization for mixtures of bose and fermi gases as their thermal response is quite different , with the specific heat scaling differently with temperature as they become degenerate .",
    "simulations in this setting should be able to confirm the existence of a heat capacity mismatch that strongly hinders the capability of a bose gas to sympathetically cool a fermi gas , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "if the interaction strength between the two species is not large enough , the fermi gas will not reach an equilibrium state with the bose gas undergoing evaporative cooling , an issue of crucial relevance for precision thermometry of degenerate fermi gases as emphasized in @xcite .",
    "it is also worth remarking that , in the case of harmonic oscillators , classical dynamics and quantum dynamics of the centroid coincide , based on the ehrenfest theorem , so there is decoupling between average motion and quantum fluctuations .",
    "this allows the analysis , even in a quantum framework , of the simpler case of a classical harmonic oscillator , with additional but separate considerations for the fluctuation part of its dynamics in its quantum counterpart , provided that the nonlinear interaction term is perturbative with respect to the uncoupled dynamics .",
    "various aspects of our model could be expanded in future work . specifically ,",
    "the role of the particle masses of the two systems in determining thermal equilibrium .",
    "this could allow the generalization of the notion of rayleigh and lorentz gases , corresponding to the two extreme limits of @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively , to arbitrary interaction potentials , not just restricted to the case of hard - sphere interactions discussed in ref .",
    "the two phenomenological parameters of the interaction need to be mapped to _ ab initio _ parameters of interatomic interactions in order to promote quantitative analyses for concrete experimental settings .",
    "further , by changing our choice of initial conditions , situations in which fast atoms with a narrow gaussian energy distribution approach an equilibrium thermal cloud can also be recovered , bridging the experimental studies performed in  @xcite . the model could be also be applied to more general dynamical situations , for instance time - dependent interactions in an atomic mixture resulting from a sudden change of the interspecies scattering length or sympathetic cooling under targeted driving of the trapping frequencies , as in shortcuts to adiabaticity  @xcite .",
    "the latter situation could make more stringent the practical feasibility of the proposal introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , or , more generally , the optimization of a targeted quantum state at finite temperature discussed in ref .  @xcite ."
