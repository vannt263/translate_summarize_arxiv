    "nasa s _ kepler _ mission has been an enormous success , discovering over 3500 planet candidates to date borucki2011,batalha2012 . among the mission",
    "s many firsts and accomplishments , however , one of the most revolutionary is that for the first time we have a robust determination of the relative abundance of different sizes of planets stretching from earth - sized all the way up to the largest hot jupiters howard2011a , fressin2013,petigura2013 .    in particular , _",
    "kepler _ has discovered an abundant new population of @xmath23 @xmath4 planets fressin2013,petigura2013 . although smaller than neptune , these planets are large enough that they must have substantial hydrogen and helium ( hereafter h / he ) envelopes to explain their radii .",
    "such planets are unlike anything found in our own solar system and fundamental questions about their structure and formation are still not understood .",
    "are these neptune - like planets that form beyond the snow - line and contain large amounts of volatile ices rogers2011 , or are these scaled up terrestrial worlds with h / he envelopes that formed close to their current orbits hansen2013,chiang2013 ?",
    "in an attempt to address these questions , a great deal of effort has been invested in acquiring precise masses for a large number of these transiting planets . in recent years",
    "this has generated a much fuller understanding of the mass - radius relation , especially for sub - neptune and super - earth sized planets weiss2013 .",
    "in particular , there are now several multi - planet _ kepler _ systems like kepler-11 with masses determined from transit timing variations ( ttvs ) [ e.g][]lissauer2011a , carter2012,cochran2011,lissauer2013 .",
    "although rare , such systems are incredibly valuable because with both a mass and a radius we can estimate a planet s bulk composition using models of interior structure and thermal evolution [ e.g.][]rogers2010a , nettelmann2011 , miller2011 , lopez2012 , valencia2013 .",
    "thus far efforts have been focused on individually determining compositions for this handful of planets .",
    "this paucity stands in stark contrast to the over 3500 kepler candidates with only measured radii .",
    "unfortunately the vast majority of these candidates are in dynamically inactive systems without strong ttvs or around distant stars too faint for radial velocity measurements .",
    "moreover , even with precise masses and radii there are inherent degeneracies which limit one s ability to constrain the bulk compositions of super - earth sized planets . for  1 - 2 @xmath4 planets the densities of water , silicate rocks , and iron ( i.e. @xmath2 1 - 10 @xmath5 ) are similar enough that it is impossible to uniquely constrain the relative abundance of these components valencia2007,rogers2010a .",
    "to some extent models of planet collisions can set upper limits on the maximum iron or water mass fractions that are physically achievable marcus2009,marcus2010 , but for a given planet this still allows a wide range of internal compositions .",
    "fortunately , models are still able to set clear and useful constraints on composition",
    ". in particular , thermal evolution models can set robust constraints on the fraction of a planet s mass in a h / he envelope .",
    "due to its significantly lower density , even a relatively minor amount h / he ( e.g. , @xmath21% of total planet mass ) has a large impact on planetary radius . for sub - neptune sized planets",
    "@xmath2 3 - 4 @xmath4 , such an envelope will dominate a planet s size regardless of the abundance of other elements .",
    "moreover , for sub - neptune sized planets at fixed bulk - composition , theoretical mass - radius curves are remarkably flat ; i.e. , planets with a given h / he abundance have very similar sizes regardless of their mass lopez2012 . as a result",
    ", there is a remarkably tight relationship between planetary radius and h / he envelope fraction that is independent of planet mass .",
    "critically , this opens up the hope of constraining compositions for the vast population of neptune and sub - neptune sized _ kepler _ candidates without measured masses .",
    "this is what we begin to explore in this paper .",
    "whenever possible it is still preferable to obtain a well measured mass .",
    "planet mass is critical for understanding how volatile rich planets accrete their initial h / he envelope bodenheimer2000,ikoma2012 and whether they can retain it against x - ray and euv driven photo - evaporation lopez2012,lopez2013,owen2012,owen2013 .",
    "nevertheless , for systems of sub - neptunes like kepler-11 , even factor of @xmath22 uncertainties on planet masses are sufficient to tightly constrain composition with precise radii lissauer2013 .",
    "this fact means that instead of only examining the _ radius _ distribution of _ kepler _ candidates , we can begin thinking about a _ composition _ distribution .",
    "in order to understand how planetary radius relates to planet mass and composition , it is necessary to fully model how a planet cools and contracts due to thermal evolution . for this work ,",
    "we have used the thermal evolution presented in lopez2012 , where additional model details can be found .",
    "similar models are frequently used to track the evolution of sub - neptunes and hot jupiters .",
    "[ e.g,][]miller2011,nettelmann2011 . unlike lopez2012 and lopez2013",
    ", here we do not consider the effects of photo - evaporation .",
    "although photo - evaporation can have a large impact on the composition of a planet [ e.g.][]baraffe2006,hubbard2007b , lopez2012,owen2012 , the effect on the thermal state of the interior is relatively minor lopez2013 .",
    "here we are primarily interested in the relationship between radius and composition as controlled by thermal evolution , as a result the effects of photo - evaporation can be ignored .",
    "in essence , present - day composition determines the radius , but that composition may have been strongly effected by formation and photo - evaporation .    at a given age , a model",
    "is defined by the mass of its heavy element core , the mass of its h / he envelope , the amount of incident radiation it receives , and the internal specific entropy of its h / he envelope . as a default model ,",
    "we assume an isothermal rock / iron core with an earth - like 2:1 rock / iron ratio , using the aneos olivine thompson1990 and sesame 2140 fe lyon1992 equations of state ( eos ) . when determining composition error bars for observed planets , however , we varied this iron fraction from pure rock to the maximum possible iron fraction from impact models in marcus2010 . for the h /",
    "he envelope we assume a fully adiabatic interior using the saumon1995 eos .",
    "in addition we consider the possibility of water - worlds and three component models using the h2o - reos for water nettelmann2008 .",
    "finally atop the h / he envelope is a relatively small radiative atmosphere , which we assume is isothermal at the equilibrium temperature .",
    "we define a planet s radius at 20 mbar , appropriate for the slant viewing geometry in optical transits hubbard2001 .    in order to quantitatively evaluate the cooling and contraction of the h / he envelope",
    ", we use a model atmosphere grid over a range of surface gravities and intrinsic fluxes .",
    "these grids relate the surface gravity and internal specific entropy to the intrinsic flux emitted for a given model .",
    "these one - dimensional radiative - convective models are computed for solar metallicity and for 50@xmath1 solar metallicity enhanced opacity atmospheres using the methods described in fortney2007 and nettelmann2011 .",
    "these atmosphere models are fully non - gray , i.e. wavelength dependent radiative transfer is performed rather than simply assuming a single infrared opacity .",
    "the atmospheres of neptune and sub - neptune sized planets might be significantly enhanced in metals fortney2013 or host extended clouds that greatly enhance atmospheric opacity morley2013 .",
    "therefore , our two atmosphere grids are a way to make a simplified first estimate of the role of enhanced opacity on planetary thermal evolution . for all runs",
    "we use the h / he saumon1995 eos for the envelope .    at very early times and very low masses , the models reach gravities beyond the edge of our cooling grid . in such cases",
    "we logarithmically extrapolate the intrinsic temperature @xmath6 as a function of gravity .",
    "this does not significantly affect our results , however , as the dependence of @xmath6 on gravity is slight and the models are only at such low gravities in the first few myr .",
    "finally , we include heating from radioactive decay in the rock / iron core and the delay in cooling due to the core s heat capacity . in order to correctly determine the mass - radius - composition relationship",
    ", it is vital to include these thermal evolution effects , since these will significantly delay cooling and contraction , particularly for planets less than @xmath25 @xmath0 .    as with previous models",
    ", we assume that planets initially form with a large initial entropy according to the traditional `` hot - start '' model fortney2007,marley2007 .",
    "specifically we start our models at an age of 1 myr with a large initial entropy of 10 @xmath7 .",
    "this assumption does not significantly affect any of our results since hot - start and cold - start models are indistinguishable by the time planets are @xmath2100 myr old marley2007,lopez2012 .",
    "moreover , mordasini2013 recently showed that for planets less massive than jupiter gravitional heating due to settling of heavy elements in the envelope can erase any difference between hot and cold starts .    for low - mass planets , the hot - start assumption results in extremely large initial radii @xmath810 @xmath4 .",
    "however , as we explore in section 3.2 , such models cool extremely rapidly such that significant contraction has already occurred by several myr . in general",
    "we present results at ages @xmath910 myr , when our results are insensitive to the initial choice of entropy .",
    "and how these depend on composition , irradiation , and age , indicated by the colors .",

    "a ) we vary the envelope fraction from 0.1 - 60% h / he , this has by far the largest impact on planet size . below @xmath23% h / he radius increases modestly with mass due to the dominance of the rocky core . for larger envelopes ,",
    "the mass - radius relation is remarkably flat until for gas giant sized planets it decreases slightly with higher mass due to the increasing self gravity of the envelope . in panel",

    "low - mass planets are larger than higher - mass planets due to their lower gravities . however , these low - mass planets are able to cool more rapidly which gradually flattens the mass - radius relation .",
    "[ studyfig],width=336,height=576 ]    planetary radius is an invaluable tool in understanding the nature of low - mass planets ; however , without the aid of thermal evolution models like those used here , it can be quite difficult to interpret . in order to better understand the information contained in planet radii",
    ", we performed a detailed parameter study of our thermal evolution and structure models for sub - neptune type planets with rock / iron cores and thick h / he envelopes .",
    "as part of this parameter study we ran over 1300 thermal evolution models varying planet mass , incident flux , envelope fraction , and atmospheric metallicity .",
    "we covered planets from 1 - 20 @xmath0 , 0.1 - 1000 @xmath10 , 0.01 - 60% h / he , for both solar metallicity and enhanced opacity models.we then recorded planet radius at every age from 10 myr to 10 gyr . the results of this study are summarized in figure [ studyfig ] and tables 2 - 7 . examining figure [ studyfig ] , it is immediately clear that iso - composition mass - radius curves are in fact remarkably flat for sub - neptune or larger planets , at least once they are a few gyr old . in each panel , we show theoretical mass - radius curves while varying the envelope fraction , incident flux , and age of the model planets . for the parameters that are not varying in each panel ,",
    "we use representative values of 5% h / he , 100 @xmath10 , and 5 gyr .",
    "turning to panel a ) , we see the enormous effect that varying the h / he envelope fraction has on planetary radius . by comparison ,",
    "any other changes to incident flux , age , or internal structure are secondary . for planets with envelopes",
    "@xmath20.1% of their total mass , the mass - radius curve does increase slightly from @xmath21.5 @xmath4 at 1 @xmath0 to @xmath22.5 @xmath4 at 20 @xmath0 . for envelopes this insubstantial , a planet s size is still dominated by its rocky / iron core and so the mass - radius curves have a similar slope to the bare rock curve shown in figure [ studyfig ] .",
    "however , as we increase the envelope fraction , the mass - radius curves rapidly flatten , beginning at low - masses , until by @xmath23% h / he , the curves are almost completely flat .    by comparison , panel b ) in figure [ studyfig ] shows the much more modest effect of varying the incident flux .",
    "more irradiated planets tend to be slightly larger because they have a large scale height in their atmospheres and because the irradiation alters the radiative transfer through their atmosphere , slowing their contraction fortney2007 .",
    "nonetheless , despite varying the incident flux by four orders of mangitude , planet radii vary by less @xmath230% .    finally , panel c ) shows how these mass - radius curves evolve over time . at early times lower mass planets",
    "are significantly larger than higher mass planets due to their similarly large internal energies and lower gravities . over time , however , these low mass planets are able to cool more rapidly than their more massive relatives , which gradually flattens the mass - radius curves . by the time the planets are @xmath2 1 gyr old we see the characteristically flat mass - radius curves for h",

    "red dotted lines correspond to solar metallicity atmospheres , while blue dashed lines correspond to enhanced opacity .",
    "solid lines indicate power - law fits as described in equation ( [ powerlaweq ] ) . here",
    "we use default values of 5 @xmath0 , 100 @xmath10 , 5% h / he , and 5 gyr .",
    "[ powerfig],width=288,height=796 ]      a quick inspection of figure [ studyfig ] makes clear that not all of a planet s properties have an equal impact on planet size .",
    "planet mass and incident flux have only a modest impact on planet size , while planet age has a larger impact , particularly at younger ages .",
    "however , by far the largest determinate of a planet s size is the fraction of its mass in a h / he envelope .",
    "one way to quantify the relative importance of composition is to construct analytic fits for radius as a function of planet mass @xmath11 , envelope fraction @xmath12 , incident flux @xmath10 , and age . in lopez2013",
    "we performed a similar analysis examining planets vulnerability to photo - evaporative mass loss .",
    "fortunately , the relationships between radius and each of these parameters are all reasonably well described by power - laws and the effects of each variable are relatively independent . as a result , we can do a reasonably good job of describing the results of our full parameter study with a set of four independent power - laws .",
    "the one caveat is that we do not fit for the total planet radius @xmath13 , but instead the radius of the h / he envelope @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the size of the rock / iron core .",
    "we do this because as @xmath12 approaces zero , the planet radius does not approach zero but instead assymptotes to @xmath15 .    to first order , however , the rock / iron equation of state is very incompressible and so we can approximate @xmath15 with the mass - radius curve of a envelope free rocky planet .",
    "assuming an earth - like composition , then @xmath15 is described by equation ( [ rockeq ] ) to within @xmath22% .",
    "if we also allow the iron - fraction of the core to vary then this error rises to @xmath210% , but for the qualitative analysis we attempting here such errors are unimportant .",
    "@xmath16 in equation ( [ rockeq ] ) refers to the mass of the rock / iron core , which for sub - neptune sized planets is approximately the same as the total planet mass @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath17    likewise , we must make a small correction to account for the size of the radiative upper atmosphere . to first approximation , this atmosphere is isothermal at the planet s equilibrium temperature @xmath18 . for sub - neptune sized planets at several gyr ,",
    "the radiative - convective boundary is typically @xmath2100 - 1000 bar . for transiting planets",
    "the broadband optical radius is typically @xmath220 mbar , or @xmath198 - 10 scale heights higher .",
    "thus the size of the radiative atmopshere is approximately given by equation ( [ atmeq ] ) , where @xmath20 is a planet s gravity and @xmath21 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "generally however , this correction is typically quite small @xmath20.1 @xmath4 except at the very highest levels of irratiation .",
    "@xmath22    with equations ( [ rockeq ] ) and ( [ atmeq ] ) in place , we can now fit for @xmath23 , and then simply add @xmath15 and @xmath24to get the total radius . the results of these fits are summarized in figure [ powerfig ] and equation ( [ powerlaweq ] ) .",
    "figure [ powerfig ] compares our power - law fits to the results of our full models for representative values of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 , and age .",
    "the error bars in each panel show the 1@xmath25 scatter about the power - law fits for the full suite of models in our parameter study .",
    "remarkably , this simple power - law description does a reasonable job of reproducing the results of our full model .",
    "in general , the analytic formulation in equation ( [ powerlaweq ] ) matches our full models to within @xmath20.1 dex .    for the age evolution",
    ", we fit separate power - laws for solar metallicity and enhanced opacity models .",
    "the solar metallicity models cool more rapidly initially . as a result",
    ", they are already relatively cold by @xmath2100 myr and so the subsequent contraction is slower .",
    "however , the enhanced opacity models must eventually cool and by several gyr any differences are erased .",
    "we fit power - laws only to the evolution after 100 myr . for solar metallicity @xmath26 while for enhanced opacity @xmath27 .",
    "equation ( [ powerlaweq ] ) shows the results for the enhanced opacity models .",
    "@xmath28    it is important to note however , that the results of these fits are only meant to be a rough approximation of the full models summarized figure [ studyfig ] and tables 2 - 6 .",
    "these fits are done purely to help understand the qualitative behavior of our thermal evolution models , not to be used in place of the full models .",
    "also , equation ( [ powerlaweq ] ) shows the fit to our the enhanced opacity models . at late times",
    "the solar metallicity models have a slightly shallower dependence on age , due to more rapid cooling at early ages .",
    "nonetheless , equations ( [ rockeq ] ) and ( [ powerlaweq ] ) do make several things quite clear .",
    "first of all , we can now quantify the importance of h / he envelope fraction ; doubling @xmath12 has an order of magnitude larger effect on @xmath13 than doubling @xmath29 and more than twice as large as an effect of doubling the age .",
    "we can also now see how flat the mass - radius curves are .",
    "although , @xmath23 decreases slightly with mass , this is almost exactly balanced by the increase in @xmath15 with increasing mass .",
    "so long as @xmath30 , then these terms will roughly balance and the mass - radius curves will be quite flat .",
    "this typically happens for planets that are @xmath81% h / he or @xmath82.5 @xmath4 .",
    "thus for most of _ kepler _ s neptune and sub - neptune sized planets , radius is quite independent of planet mass and is instead a direct measure of bulk h / he envelope fraction .",
    "planet , receiving 100 @xmath10 from a sun - like star .",
    "the black solid line shows the overall cooling rate while the dotted and dashed lines show the cooling rate of the rock / iron core and the heating from radioactive decay , respectively .",
    "the solid gray line shows the cooling rate if we ignore radioactivity and the need to cool the core .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the need to include these terms when calculating the thermal evolution of sub - neptune like planets.[evolfig],width=336,height=240 ]    .",
    "solar metallicity models cool rapidly at young ages and then experience more gradual cooling , while enhanced opacity models cool more steadily at all ages.[entfig],width=336,height=240 ]    , i.e. , the equivalent blackbody temperature a planet s net outgoing flux , vs. planet mass for 5 gyr old planets receiving 100 @xmath10 with enhanced opacity atmospheres .",
    "colors show different h / he envelope fractions . clearly , by several gyr lower - mass planets are signficantly colder than higher mass planets .",
    "this demonstrates the need to perform full thermal evolution calculations . simply assuming a fixed luminosity per mass",
    "will greatly overestimate the size of planets below @xmath31 @xmath0 .",
    "[ tintfig],width=336,height=240 ]      one of the key features of our thermal evolution and structure models is the relative flatness of mass - radius curves at fixed h / he envelope fraction . in sections [ studysec ] and [ powersec ] , we showed that for planet with @xmath81% h / he , planet size is more or less indepent of mass . thus far , however , we have not explained the origin of this flatness .    in fact , searching through the literature will show a wide range of mass - radius curves with very different behavior at low masses .",
    "although , all the models tend to agree above @xmath210 - 20 @xmath0 , there can be large disagreements below @xmath25 @xmath0 . in some cases , radius decreases with decreasing mass in much the same way as the earth - like mass radius curves in figure [ studyfig ] . in other cases ,",
    "the radius increases to implausibly large sizes due to the planets lower gravity rogers2011 . generally , these models face one of two limitations . either they they ignore the contributions of the rock / iron core to the thermal evolution , i.e. , the need to cool the core and heating from radioactive decay , or they do not perform an evolution calculation at all and instead use static structure models in which the internal energy of the planet is treated as a free parameter .    for the neptune and sub - neptune sized planets that we are focusing on here ,",
    "@xmath290 - 99% of a planet s mass is contained in the rock / iron core . as a result ,",
    "ignoring the effects of that core on the thermal evolution will significantly underestimate a planet s cooling timescale , and therefore its radius .",
    "this is a common simplification with thermal evolution models , like our own , that were originally developed to model massive gas giants , where the core has a negligible impact on the overall thermal evolution .",
    "the importance of these effects , however , is clearly demonstrated in figure [ evolfig ] , which shows the various contributions to the overall thermal evolution , for a typical 5 @xmath0 , 1% h / he sub - neptune sized planet . at every age ,",
    "the cooling luminosity of the planet is dominated by these core cooling and heating terms . at early times , the thermal evolution is largely regulated by the need to cool the rock / iron core with its relatively large heat capacity alfe2002,guillot1995 . at ages @xmath81 gyr ,",
    "radioactive heating also becomes comparable to the core cooling rate , thanks mostly due to the decay of @xmath32k anders1989 . on the other hand , ignoring these terms leads to a planet that is @xmath230 - 100@xmath1 less luminous at late times , and underestimates the final radius by @xmath20.5 @xmath4 .",
    "some models [ e.g.,][]mordasini2012c , make the compromise of including radiogenic heating but not including the effect of the core s heat capacity .",
    "this is much better than ignoring the core altogether , but as shown in figure [ evolfig ] both terms are important and this will lead to underestimating the radii of sub - neptune planets , especially at ages @xmath331 gyr .    on the other hand , it is also quite common to use static internal structure models which do not track a planet s thermal evolution , but instead assume a fixed specific luminosity ( i.e. power per unit mass ) , which is then treated as a free variable rogers2011 .",
    "this is a common simplification made when a small h / he envelope is added to detailed models of terrestrial planets , for which the cooling history is harder to determine and has little impact on overall planet size valencia2007 .",
    "when calculating possible compositions for a single planet [ e.g.,][]rogers2010b , this is fine , so long as the resulting uncertainty in the internal energy is accounted for .",
    "however , when plotting iso - composition mass - radius curves , this leads to an unphysical upturn at low masses .",
    "low - mass planets of course have lower surface gravities , so assigning them the same specific luminosities as more massive planets will significantly inflate their radii .    in reality though , low mass planets are able to cool much more quickly .",
    "partly this is due to their low gravities which slightly increases the rate of radiative transfer through their atmospheres fortney2007 .",
    "mostly , however , it is simply due to the fact that lower mass planets have similar radiating surface areas to slightly higher mass planets , but significantly smaller total internal energies . as a result ,",
    "even if different mass planets start with similar specific internal energies , low mass planets will more quickly deplete their thermal energy reserves , leading to much shorter cooling times .",
    "this fact is summarized in figures [ entfig ] and [ tintfig ] .",
    "figure [ entfig ] shows various cooling curves for the internal entropy in the h / he envelope .",
    "planets start with large initial entropy , and therefore radii .",
    "models rapidly cool for the first few myr until the cooling timescale is comparable to the age . as described above , all things being equal , less massive planets will tend to have shorter cooling timescales due to their smaller energy reservoirs . as a result ,",
    "lower mass models tend to be colder at all ages .",
    "this counter balances the fact that lower mass planets have lower gravities and produces the flat mass - radius curves seen in figure [ studyfig ] .",
    "this result is insensitive to our choice of initial entropy for ages @xmath810 myr .    as in figure , [ powerfig ]",
    "solar metallicity models cool rapidly for their first @xmath210 myr and then contract more slowly .",
    "the enhanced opacity models on the other hand , cool more steadily throughout their history . eventually however",
    ", the enhanced opacity models must also cool and contract and by several gyr they have largely erased any differences with the solar models . at the same time , there is a slight change in the cooling rates due to the decay of @xmath34 .",
    "figure [ tintfig ] shows the end result of this evolution .",
    "here we show planetary intrinsic temperature @xmath6 versus planet mass for various h / he envelope fractions for 5 gyr old planets receiving 100 @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath6 is the equivalent blackbody temperature of the net radiation leaving a planet , effectively it is the temperature the planet would have if the parent star was removed .",
    "as we can see , by 5 gyr , low mass planets are always significantly cooler than higher mass planets at the same compositions , regardless of h / he fraction or atmosphere metallicity .",

    "we exclude confirmed planets with analytical ttv mass estimates from xie2012 due to the degeneracy between planet mass and free eccentricity .",
    "for inflated hot jupiters with radii larger than that of pure h / he , we simply assigned 100% h / he since such planets are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "meanwhile , for potentially rocky planets like corot-7b leger2009,queloz2009 and kepler-10b batalha2011 , we set strict upper limits on the size of any potential h / he envelope .",

    "in addition , we included theoretical uncertainties on core iron fraction , core heat capacity , atmospheric albedo , etc .",

    "finally , we include three theoretical iso - composition curves .",
    "the rust colored curve shows pure silicate rock ( specifically olivine ) .",
    "the dark blue curve corresponds to pure water worlds on a 10 day orbit around a 5 gyr old sun - like star , however , varying these details does not significantly change the curve .",

    "roughly speaking , this last curve forms the dividing line between the inflated and non - inflated hot jupiters .",
    "several features of the mass - radius relation are immediately apparent . as noted in weiss2013 , there is a roughly power - law increase in radius from @xmath2 1 - 100 @xmath0 , above which radius saturates at approximately a jupiter radius . below @xmath2 10 @xmath0",
    "there is a particularly large scatter in radius , with planets ranging from the potentially rocky to sub - neptune sized planets with @xmath23% h / he . for low - mass planets",
    "there is also an inverse correlation between radius and incident flux which may be due to photo - evaporative loss of h / he lopez2012 , owen2013 .    above @xmath40",
    "we find the true gas giants including the highly inflated hot jupiters . here",
    "the correlation with incident flux is the reverse of that at low - mass with the most irradiated planets being extremely inflated .",
    "it is unclear why there do not appear to be any super - inflated hot jupiters below @xmath40 , it is possible that such planets would be unstable to photo - evaporation or roche - lobe overflow jackson2010 or have a high mass fraction of heavy elements miller2011 .",
    "turning to the compositions of these planets , it is immediately clear that h / he envelope fraction is strongly correlated with both planet mass and radius .",
    "below @xmath41 @xmath0 , planets range from potentially rocky super - earth sized planets to sub - neptunes with a few percent h / he envelopes . from @xmath42 @xmath0",

    "are completely dominated by gas accreted during formation .",
    "however , on closer inspection , where there is scatter in the mass - radius relationship it is the planet radius that correlates with composition .",
    "we argue here that planet radius is first and foremost a proxy for a planet s h / he inventory .",
    "the fact that both composition and radius correlate with mass is due to the fact that more massive planets are able accrete more gas during formation .",
    "the radius saturates at @xmath2100 @xmath0 because planet size does not simply increase with increasing h / he mass but rather with increasing h / he mass _ fraction_. as shown in section [ studysec ] , there is an approximately power - law relationship between the size of a planet s h / he envelope and the planets",
    "h / he mass fraction .",
    "a 100 @xmath0 planet with a 10 @xmath0 core , is already 95% h / he , as a result doubling the mass will not significantly increase the h / he envelope fraction or the radius .",
    "although incredibly valuable , planetary radius is in some sense not a fundamental parameter of a planet .",
    "it changes as a planet evolves and only through the aid of thermal evolution and structure models like those used here , does it tell us about a planet s structure and composition .",

    "here each planet is color - coded according to its mass .",

    "@xmath0 there is a strong increase in both radii and h / he envelope fraction transitioning from neptune sized planets with @xmath210% h / he up to true gas giants that are almost entirely h / he . above @xmath2100 @xmath0",

    "can span up to a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "nonetheless the scatter in envelope fraction is typically only @xmath20.3 dex .",
    "this is what we mean when we state that radius is primarily a proxy for composition .    thus far , however , we have only considered dry interiors with h / he envelopes atop rock / iron cores .",
    "the gray shaded region in figure [ rcfig ] shows the effect of varying the water abundance of planets in our model . using our three layer models we varied the water abundance of the interior from completely - dry , up to 90% of core mass , where by `` core '' we mean the combined mass of the rock and water layers .",
    "for clarity , we then fit power - laws to best fit radii and compositions under both scenarios ; the gray shaded region shows the area in between these fits . clearly , allowing this degeneracy does slightly increase the scatter in the radius - composition relationship",
    "nonetheless , above @xmath23 @xmath4 this does not alter the conclusion that radius and h / he envelope fraction are intimately related .",
    "as a result , this means that we can recast the mass - radius relationship in figure [ mrfig ] as a mass-_composition _ relationship .",
    "this is shown in figure [ mcfig ] . by doing this",
    "we have transformed the observable mass - radius relationship into one that is directly relatable to models of planet formation .",
    "here we can clearly see that there is a fundamental change in the relationship around @xmath210 @xmath0 .",
    "below this planets typically have less than @xmath25% of their mass in h / he with no clear relationship between envelope fraction and mass . above this , however , we see a steady rise in envelope fraction from sub - neptunes up to gas giants .",
    "these trends are all understandable in the light of the traditional core accretion model of planet formation [ e.g.,][]hayashi1985,bodenheimer1986 .",
    "if a planet s rocky core becomes sufficiently massive , typically @xmath25 - 10 @xmath0 , then its gravity becomes sufficiently strong to trigger runaway accretion from the disk . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed black line in figure [ mcfig ] shows a the simple toy model in which all planets have 10 @xmath0 core with solar metalcity h / he envelopes . in reality",
    "most planets lie to the right of this curve , possibly indicating that the accreted additional planetessimals embedded in the nebula mordasini2013 .    the results of figures [ mrfig ] and [ mcfig ] are consistent with this traditional picture of core accretion .",
    "below @xmath210 @xmath0 , according to our models planets are almost entirely composed of heavy elements by mass . above this , most planets are roughly consistent with @xmath45 @xmath0 of heavy elements along with accreted h / he envelopes .",
    "there is of course a simplified view of planet formation . in reality",
    "there is considerable variation in disk mass , lifetime , metallicity , planet history , etc .",
    "all of which introduces considerable scatter into the mass - composition relation .",
    "nonetheless , figure [ mcfig ] offers clear evidence for the core - accretion model of planet formation , at least for the close - in planets found by _ kepler _",
    "throughout this paper , we have repeatedly used the terms super - earth and sub - neptune to refer to low - mass _ kepler _ planets .",
    "what exactly is the difference between these classes of planets ?",
    "for our purpose a sub - neptune is any planet whose radius can not be explained by a bare rock / iron model , i.e. , it must have some sort of large optically - thick h / he or water envelope .",
    "super - earth on the other hand implies a more terrestrial planets , one that may have a solid or liquid surface and where the atmosphere , if any , contributes a negligible fraction to the planet s size .",
    "although this may seem like semantics , one of the long - term goals of exoplanet science is to search for biomarkers in the transmission spectra of potentially habitable super - earths . whether or not a planet has a large h",
    "/ he envelope tens of kbar deep has very important implications for habitability .    the current definition used by the _ kepler _",
    "mission is that planets 1.5 - 2.0 @xmath4 are super - earths , while planets 2.0 - 4.0 @xmath4 , are sub - neptunes .",
    "these round numbers however , do not quite correspond to our more physically motivated definition of whether or not a planet has a thick envelope .",
    "figure [ minfig ] plots the minimum h / he envelope fractions required by our models vs. planet mass for several different radii in the 1.5 - 2.0 @xmath4 super - earth / sub - neptune transition region .    .",
    "here we assume water - free sub - neptunes with h / he envelopes atop earth - like rocky cores.[minfig],width=336,height=240 ]    it is quite difficult to construct a 2.0 @xmath4 planet that does not have some sort of thick envelope . assuming an earth - like interior",
    ", such planets would have to be 16.5 @xmath0 , to explain their size without any type of envelope .",
    "for a completely iron - free interior , it is possible to construct a 2.0 @xmath4 that is only 11 @xmath0 .",
    "however , completely iron - free is probably not a realistic composition for planets of several earth masses .",
    "indeed both kepler-10b and corot-7b , may be slightly enhanced in iron compared to the earth batalha2011,hatzes2011 .",
    "this stands in contrast to the observed sample of likely rocky planets all of which are @xmath4610 @xmath0 .",
    "it is possible that more massive rocky planets are yet to be found , however , the @xmath47 is essentially complete for 2.0 @xmath4 within 100 days petigura2013 . for follow - up rv and ttv mass measurements to have missed a population of @xmath4610 @xmath0 rocky planets , they would need to somehow be biased against more massive and therefore easier to detect planets .",
    "moreover , there are basic arguments in core - accretion theory that lead us to expect that there should not be @xmath220 @xmath0 rocky planets . by the time a planet is @xmath210 @xmath0 ,",
    "its gravity should be sufficiently strong that it should be able to accrete a substantial h / he envelope from the disk ikoma2012 , and for periods @xmath810 days be able to retain it against photo - evaporation lopez2013 .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume a more typical low - mass planet with a 5 @xmath0 earth - like core , then to be 2.0 @xmath4 it would need 0.5% of its mass in a h / he envelope .",
    "this may not sound like much , but it corresponds to @xmath220 kbars of hydrogen and helium , @xmath48 higher than the pressure at the bottom of the marianias trench .",
    "moreover , the temperature at the bottom of such an envelope would be @xmath83000 k , even for ages of several gyr .",
    "we believe that such a planet is more properly classified as a sub - neptune . as a result , 2.0 @xmath4 is more of a quite hard upper limit for the size of a envelope - free super - earth and most of the planets between @xmath2 1.75 and 2.0 @xmath4 are likely to be h / he rich sub - neptunes .    if 2.0 @xmath4 is really the hard upper limit for the super - earth / sub - neptune transition , then what is the lower limit ?",
    "as shown in figure [ minfig ] , for planets @xmath331.5 @xmath4 it is entirely possible to explain their radii without any h / he .",
    "moreover if such planets do have any h / he , then it must be @xmath330.1% of their mass , even if we assume a maximally iron - rich core .",
    "this is small enough of envelope that the rock / iron core dominates the planets size .",
    "moreover , as shown in lopez2013 and owen2013 , such tenuous envelopes are quite - vulnerable to being completely photo - evaporated , at least at period @xmath33100 days .",
    "this does not exclude the possibility that 1.5 @xmath4 can not have large water envelopes , but it does suggest that they are unlikely to have large h / he envelopes .    to summarize , we can say that 2.0 @xmath4 is likely a hard upper limit for the maximum size of envelope - free rocky super - earths and 1.5 is likely a lower limit for the minimum size of a h / he rich sub - neptune . as a result , we suggest using 1.75 @xmath4 rather than 2.0 @xmath4 for the dividing line between these classes of planets .",
    "in sections [ studysec ] and [ compsec ] , we showed that planetary radius is to first order a proxy for a planet s composition above @xmath22 @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the observed radius occurrence distribution for _ kepler _ candidates found by fressin2013 and petigura2013 , is in reality a _ composition _ occurrence distribution for close in planets at several gyr .",
    "in particular , fressin2013 and petigura2013 found that there is a sharp , roughly power - law like drop off in the frequency of planet occurrence above @xmath23 @xmath4 , while below this there a plateau in the plant occurrence rate down to at least 1 @xmath4 .",
    "this distribution makes sense in the light of traditional core accretion theory .",
    "the timescale for planetesimal collisions to form rocky planets is short compared to the typical lifetime of a disk and such planetesimals are preferentially concentrated deep in the stars potential well , so nature easily makes large populations of irradiated rocky planets chiang2013,hansen2013 .    at larger sizes ,",
    "planets are limited by their ability to accrete a h / he envelope from the disk before the disk dissipates bodenheimer2000,ikoma2012,mordasini2012c . in these models",
    "the accretion of the envelope is limited by the ability of the proto - planetary envelope to cool and contract .",
    "this makes it difficult to accrete larger initial h / he envelopes , particularly if the _ kepler _",
    "population formed in situ ikoma2012 .",
    "it easier to form large planets further out , particularly beyond the snow - line where the increase in the local solid mass makes it easier to trigger runaway accretion to make a gas - giant .",
    "the relative scarcity of hot jupiters found by fressin2013 and petigura2013 , is an indication that whatever migration mechanism brings in gas giants to orbits @xmath33100 days must be fairly rare .    one key puzzle , however , is the location of the break in the planet occurrence rate distribution .",
    "if it were due to a transition from a large rocky population to a sub - neptune population , with planet occurrence declining with increase envelope fraction , then one would expect the break to occur at @xmath21.5 - 1.8 @xmath4 the likely maximum size for bare rocky planets .",
    "instead the break occurs at 2.8 @xmath4 , indicating that the occurence plateau must include many volatile rich planets .",
    "although 2.8 @xmath4 is far too large for bare rocky planets , it is achievable for h / he free water - worlds .",
    "a 10 @xmath0 planet with 80% of its mass in a water envelope would be @xmath22.7 @xmath4 . as a result ,",
    "it is at least possible that the break in the planet occurence distribution is a transition from an abundant population of rocky _ and _ water rich planets to a population with accreted h / he envelopes .",
    "otherwise , models must explain why plateau should include a substantial population of planets with @xmath21 - 3% of their mass in h / he envelopes before dropping off at larger envelope fractions .",
    "one potential explanation is that perhaps the @xmath22 - 3 @xmath4 planets have hydrogen envelopes that were outgassed instead of accreted directly from the nebula .",
    "elkins - tanton2008 showed that low - mass planets can outgass up to @xmath25% of their mass after formation in h@xmath49 .",
    "however , this was only the case if the planets interiors we initially very wet , with @xmath2 half the mass of their initial mantles in water .",
    "this again requires a large of amount of water or other volatile ices to migrate to short period orbits .",
    "it is also important to note that although the observed radius distribution may tell us the composition distribution of _ kepler _ candidates today , this is not the same as the initial distribution the planets formed with .",
    "as showed in lopez2012 , lopez2013 , and owen2013 the observed _ kepler _ population has likely been significantly sculpted by photo - evaporation .",
    "close - in low - mass planets have likely lost a significant fraction of their initial h / he inventories , resulting in smaller radii today .",
    "this effect is compounded by the fact that less irradiated planets should be able to accrete larger initial h / he envelopes in the first place ikoma2012 . as more quarters of data",
    "are analyzed and the occurrence distribution pushes out to longer periods there should be a distinct increase in the abundance of neptune and sub - neptune sized planets .",
    "another potential effect of photo - evaporation is the opening up a slight `` occurrence valley '' in the radius - flux distribution lopez2013,owen2013 .",
    "photo - evaporation makes it less likely that planets will survive with envelopes @xmath331% of their mass on highly irradiated orbits .",
    "planets will tend to either retain more substantial envelope , or lose them entirely .",
    "more work needs to be done to carefully search for such a deficit , however there are some preliminary indications that it may exist .",
    "examining both the raw candidate distribution owen2013 , and a well - studied sample of m - dwarfs morton2013 , appears to show a slight dip in the frequency of planets at @xmath22 @xmath4 .",
    "such hints are still preliminary , but if real this has important implications for constraining the compositions of the _ kepler _ population , since any large variation in the water fraction of close - in will tend to erase such a feature lopez2013 . using the models presented here ,",
    "it is possible to instead study the _ kepler _ envelope fraction distribution , which should aid in detecting any such `` occurrence valley . ''",
    "one of the key strengths of the thermal evolution models used here is that they allow us to predict the radius of a planet as a function of mostly observable parameters ; namely , planet mass , incident flux , age , and composition . for neptune and sub - neptune size planets",
    ", we showed in section [ studysec ] , the effect of varying planet mass or incident flux on the radius is an order of magnitude smaller than the effect of varying the fraction of a planet s mass in a h / he envelope . in section [ flatsec ]",
    ", we described how this flatness in iso - composition mass - radius curves , arises as a natural result of our thermal evolution models . as a result of these features ,",
    "planetary radius is to first order a proxy for the h / he inventory of sub - neptune and larger planets , almost independent of their mass . in section [ compsec ]",
    "we showed this close connection between radius and envelope fraction for the observed population of transiting planets with measured masses .",
