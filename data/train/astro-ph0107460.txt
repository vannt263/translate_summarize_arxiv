    "progress in the study of qso absorption line systems has gone hand in hand with the advancement of technology over the past few years . during the 1980 s developments in echelle spectroscopy with sensitive electronic detectors increased the attainable resolution by a factor of ten .",
    "the detailed analysis of the absorption systems in these spectra was possible through absorption line profile fitting .",
    "the increase in spectral dispersion coupled with the need to obtain a respectable s / n , however , forced astronomers to observe the same object for many nights on 4@xmath1m - class telescopes , restricting the number of objects it was possible to observe . in the 1990 s the 10@xmath1 m keck telescope",
    "together with its powerful instrument hires enabled us to obtain optical spectra of faint , high redshift qsos at unprecedented spectral resolution ( @xmath2km@xmath1s@xmath3 ) and a signal - to - noise ratio in excess of a hundred in a single night .",
    "meanwhile , ultra - violet spectroscopy using the hubble space telescope opened a window on qso absorbers at low redshift . using these data , very detailed studies of the chemical properties of the largest absorbers , damped lyman - alpha systems ( dlas ) , have provided a wealth of information about the formation of structure . understanding the chemical evolutionary history of galaxies , seen here in absorption , is fundamental to the study of galaxy formation",
    ".    the study of dlas has suffered from the small number of objects , approximately one hundred , that are currently known .",
    "although detailed studies of individual objects are very revealing , hst imaging of qso fields has revealed a wide range of luminosities and morphologies for dla counterparts . hence to determine the evolution in the absorption properties of a such mixed population of galaxies ,",
    "much larger samples of qso absorbers will be required .    with the recent release of the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ) 10k catalogue ( croom et al .",
    "2001a ) the number of known qsos has suddenly and dramatically increased . with the 2qz rapidly approaching its target of 25000 qsos , together with sloan digital sky survey observations ( fan et al .",
    "1999 ) , unprecedented numbers of new qso spectra will soon be available from which we can identify and study large numbers of new heavy element absorption systems .",
    "as the 2qz spectra were taken primarily to confirm the identity of qsos , and determine their redshift , they have a typical signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath410 , and a resolution of @xmath48 . although this is not ideal for absorption line analysis , it is possible to identify strong heavy element absorption systems , especially those with distinctive features , such as mg@xmath5ii / fe@xmath5ii absorption .    in this letter",
    "we examine the highest s / n spectra from the 2qz 10k release and identify over 100 new heavy element absorbers , suitable for higher resolution follow - up .",
    "these absorption systems map the spatial distribution of high-@xmath0 gas and metals _ in exactly the same volumes _ that the foreground 2qz qsos themselves sample and hence the 2qz gives us the unique opportunity to directly compare the two tracers of large scale structure .",
    "we examine the cross - correlation of the two populations to see how they are relatively clustered .",
    "finally , we consider the colour of the qsos containing absorption systems , relative to the 2qz average and detect a small amount of dust in these metal systems .",
    "the 2qz comprises two @xmath6 declination strips , one at the south galactic pole and one in an equatorial region in the north galactic cap .",
    "qsos candidates were selected by ultra - violet excess ( uvx ) in the @xmath7-@xmath8:@xmath8-@xmath9 plane , using apm measurements of uk schmidt telescope photographic plates ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "2qz objects were observed with the 2-degree field instrument ( lewis , glazebrook & taylor 1998 ) on the anglo - australian telescope using the low resolution 300b grating , providing a dispersion of 178.8  mm@xmath3 ( 4.3  pixel@xmath3 ) and a resolution of @xmath10  ( @xmath42 pixels ) over the wavelength range 3700  7500 .",
    "each field received approximately 1 hour integration , adjusted to match conditions where possible .",
    "the data were reduced using the pipeline reduction system 2dfdr ( bailey & glazebrook 1999 ) . following bias subtraction ,",
    "the spectra from each fibre were extracted and wavelength calibrated using a cuar+he arc .",
    "sky subtraction was done using a mean sky spectrum determined from between six and twenty sky - dedicated fibres in each frame .",
    "the reduced 2df spectra were identified automatically by autoz ( miller et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , which also determines the redshift of the qsos .",
    "these identifications were confirmed by eye .",
    "approximately 18000 qso redshifts have been obtained to date , making this survey already an order of magnitude larger than any previous qso survey .",
    "the primary science goal of the 2qz is to obtain an accurate measure of large - scale structure via the study of qso clustering .",
    "the observations are therefore optimised to maximise the number of qso identifications . hence the s / n and resolution , whilst ideal for identifying broad emission features , are generally too low to detect all but the strongest narrow absorption features .",
    "furthermore , the sky - subtraction possible on a multi - fibre instrument such as 2df is relatively poor , leading to large uncertainties in the zero - level of the spectra ( making equivalent width measurements less reliable ) , and variable sky lines , particularly at the red end of the spectrum .",
    "having said that , the 10000 qso spectra released so far are still , as we shall demonstrate , a hugely valuable resource for qso absorption line studies .",
    "to detect absorption systems in the spectra of the 2qz qsos released in the 10k catalogue ( croom et al 2001a ) , qsos with @xmath11 and s / n@xmath12 were selected from the catalogue for examination by eye .",
    "systems identified by two or more absorption features are included in this analysis ( due to the resolution of the spectra , doublets such as c@xmath5iv @xmath13 and mg@xmath5ii @xmath14 were counted as single features ) . as the primary aim of this letter is to identify heavy element systems that could correspond to dla candidates ,",
    "only systems that exhibit low ionisation absorption features are reported here .",
    "several of the spectra examined were bal qsos , or exhibited relatively high ionisation @xmath15 systems which are excluded from this analysis .",
    "also excluded were several c@xmath5iv systems , often with associated si@xmath5iv and h@xmath5i absorption . finally all unconfirmed single absorption features are excluded , including ly@xmath16   absorbers in the forest of high redshift qsos that do not exhibit metal features , and individual metal features that most likely correspond to c@xmath5iv or mg@xmath5ii systems .    in total , 137 low - ionisation absorption systems were detected in 1266 qso spectra .",
    "of these , 120 are mg@xmath5ii systems , and the remaining 17 are c@xmath5iv systems at higher redshift , which also exhibit low ionisation species , and in 12 cases , strong ly@xmath16   absorption . of these , two have a rest equivalent width in excess of 10 , and hence are strong damped ly@xmath16   line candidates .",
    "three example 2qz spectra showing absorption systems are shown in fig .  1 , and table  1 contains a full list of the low ionisation absorption systems . where possible the rest equivalent width ( @xmath17 ) of the mg@xmath5ii @xmath14 doublet (  ) , or h@xmath18i",
    "@xmath19 for the high redshift systems , is quoted . due to the low resolution of the data",
    "the separate mg@xmath5ii features are often not resolved .",
    "the @xmath17 determination is not highly reliable due to the relatively poor sky subtraction possible with fibre observations , leading to zero - level uncertainty , particularly at the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "also , there is relatively high continuum uncertainty due to the low s / n and resolution of the data , particularly in the ly@xmath16   forest .",
    "typical uncertainty in the @xmath17 is of order 20% .",

    "the largest heavy element absorption systems , dlas , are generally believed to be the progenitors of present day spiral galaxies ( wolfe 1995 ) .",
    "they dominate the mass of neutral gas at redshift @xmath28 , a mass comparable with that of the stars in present day spiral disks , suggesting that dlas are the source of most of material available for star formation at high redshift ( lanzetta , wolfe & turnshek 1995 ) . 21 cm emission surveys of the local universe have found that the contribution from intergalactic gas to the h@xmath18i cross - section is negligible , whereas spirals contribute around 90 per cent ( rao & briggs 1993 ) , adding further weight to this hypothesis .",
    "hst imaging of qso fields has been carried out in an attempt to determine the morphology and size of dla absorbers .",
    "a wide range of luminosities and morphologies were seen , a result inconsistent with the standard h@xmath18i disk paradigm ( le brun et al .",
    "1997 ; rao & turnshek 1998 ) .",
    "pettini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed further that the metallicity of dlas does not increase towards solar values with decreasing redshift , as expected by the large spiral progenitor model , but instead little evolution is seen , with metallicities staying sub - solar .",
    "it is possible that dust in the most metal rich galaxies obscures light from any background qso making these objects too faint to see ( pei & fall 1995 ) .",
    "if so , this dust bias could help explain why the observed dlas appear metal poor in comparison to present day galaxies .",
    "another possible explanation is that the absorption cross - section may be dominated by diffuse objects with relatively low star - formation rates , whereas rapid star formation occurs in the most compact galaxies ( mo , mao & white 1999 ) .",
    "this evidence all points towards a mixed population of galaxies , with a large fraction of low - mass , or perhaps low surface brightness galaxies , being responsible for the dla absorbers , rather than the simpler spiral progenitor model ( vladilo 1999 ) .",
    "qso imaging experiments at redshifts out to @xmath292 suggest that the clustering environment of uvx qsos is similar to optically selected galaxies ( smith , boyle & maddox 1995 ; croom & shanks 1999 ) . by measuring the two - point auto - correlation function of the 2qz qsos , croom et al .",
    "( 2001b ) compared the clustering of qsos at redshift @xmath30 with the clustering of normal galaxies locally ( @xmath31 ) and concluded that the clustering properties are very similar .",
    "it would be preferable , however , to compare directly the clustering of qsos and galaxies in the same redshift intervals . whilst determining accurate redshifts for a large sample of high - redshift optically selected galaxies is challenging",
    ", absorption line analysis offers a complementary approach to constraining the qso - galaxy bias .    to examine how the absorption systems cluster relative to the 2qz qsos",
    ", we calculate the two - point absorber - qso cross - correlation function , @xmath32 , in an @xmath33=0.3 , @xmath34=0.7 cosmology . to estimate the effective volume of each bin , a catalogue of unclustered , random points that have the same radial selection function and angular mask , and approximately twenty times the mean density as the 2qz qsos is constructed , taking into account galactic extinction ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) .",
    "the random catalogue number density is normalised to the number of observed qsos on each ukst plate to correct for possible small residual calibration errors in the relative magnitude zero points of the ukst plates ( see croom et al .",
    "( 2001b ) for further details ) .",
    "we use the estimator @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of absorber - qso pairs at a given separation in redshift space , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the number of absorber - random pairs . as we are determining the average clustering of qsos about each absorber , the spatial distribution of the absorbers themselves is not important ( this distribution is not straightforward as the absorbers are selected along multiple lines - of - sight through the volume ) .",
    "the errors are calculated using the poisson estimate , which is accurate at small scales , @xmath39mpc , because each pair is independent .",
    "all absorbers that lie within @xmath40 of the emission redshift of the qso are excluded from the analysis to ensure that we are only considering truly intervening absorbers .",
    "in fact , all of the absorber - qso pairs within @xmath41mpc separation are due to an absorber in a different line - of - sight to the qso .",
    "the absorber - qso cross - correlation function , @xmath32 , is shown in fig .",
    "2 . as there are relatively few absorbers in the analysis , the errors are still quite large and clustering is only detected at the 1.5@xmath42 level .",
    "the amplitude of the clustering appears to agree remarkably well with the qso auto - correlation measurement ( croom et al .",
    "2001b ) ; further evidence that qsos are clustered like normal galaxies at these high redshifts . by including absorption systems detected in low s / n spectra , and extending this analysis to the full 2qz dataset when the survey is complete it will soon be possible to measure the cross - correlation function to much higher precision",
    "the average colour of the qsos in this sample is @xmath43 . to test whether the qso spectra have been reddened by dust in the foreground absorption systems",
    ", we compare this colour to the average colour of qsos in the 2qz catalogue . as qso colour is redshift dependent , we draw random samples from the full catalogue with the same redshift distribution as the qsos in this absorption line sample to produce a fair comparison . the resultant expected qso colour for a random sample of 2qz qsos of this size and redshift distribution is @xmath44 .",
    "hence we have a @xmath45 detection of reddening in the absorption system qsos .",
    "the spectra are reddened by an average of @xmath46 , corresponding to a visual extinction @xmath47 , assuming an @xmath48 extinction curve ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) .    adopting the relationship between interstellar extinction and neutral hydrogen gas column density from bohlin , savage & drake ( 1978 ) , @xmath49 we obtain an average neutral hydrogen column of @xmath50atoms@xmath51 for our absorbers .",
    "this is approximately the minimum column density of a dla , and is probably considerably smaller than the average neutral hydrogen column of our sample .",
    "the reason for this is that the dust - to - gas ratio in high redshift dlas is typically much lower than in the local interstellar medium . using zinc and chromium abundance measurements , pettini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the average dust - to - gas ratio in dlas at @xmath52 is @xmath53 that in the milky way .",
    "our sample of absorbers is at a lower redshift and , assuming an average neutral hydrogen column of @xmath54atoms@xmath51 , the observed extinction appears consistent with a dust - to - gas ratio of about a quarter that of the milky way .",
    "it is possible that selection effects could bias our sample towards higher metallicity or column density .",
    "further observations could be used to determine these quantities , and hence allow a more reliable measurement of the dust in these systems .",
    "the 2qz is based on observations made with the anglo - australian telescope and the uk schmidt telescope , and we would like to thank our colleagues on the 2df galaxy redshift survey team and all the staff at the aat that have helped to make this survey possible .",
