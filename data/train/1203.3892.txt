    "in many respects , the properties of colloidal fluids resemble almost perfectly those of the correspondent atomic liquid @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the equilibrium phase diagram , and in general all the equilibrium thermodynamic properties , of a specific model system ( say a lennard - jones liquid ) will be independent of the microscopic ( either molecular or brownian ) dynamics that govern the motion of the @xmath0 interacting particles that constitute the system .",
    "this implies that these equilibrium properties can be generated using either molecular or brownian dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although time - dependent properties are expected in general to depend on the specific microscopic dynamics , some features associated with the long - time dynamic behavior of the system also seem to be rather insensitive to the microscopic short - time dynamics .",
    "this appears to be particularly true regarding the rather complex dynamic behavior of these systems as they approach the glass transition @xcite .",
    "determining the range of validity of this analogy continues to be a relevant topic in the study of the dynamics of liquids .    from the theoretical side one would like to unify colloidal and atomic liquids in a common theoretical description of the relaxation dynamics of the local density fluctuations , which explicitly exhibits the origin of the similarities and differences in their macroscopic dynamics .",
    "one possible general framework for such theoretical analysis is the concept of the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) @xcite .",
    "this equation describes the dynamics of the thermal fluctuations @xmath1 of the instantaneous value of the macroscopic variables @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , around its equilibrium value @xmath4 , and has the structure of the most general linear stochastic equation with additive noise for the vector @xmath5^{\\dagger } $ ] ( with the dagger meaning transpose ) .",
    "the gle equation has been widely used in the description of thermal fluctuation phenomena in simple liquid systems , and boon and yip s textbook @xcite contains a detailed account of its early use to describe the dynamics of simple liquids .",
    "although this stochastic equation is conventionally associated with the mori - zwanzig projection operator formalism @xcite , in reality its structure is not a consequence of the hamiltonian basis of mori - zwanzig s derivation ; instead , it is essentially equivalent to the mathematical condition of stationarity @xcite .    thus , in ref .",
    "@xcite the gle formalism , understood in the latter manner , was employed to derive the most general diffusion equation of a model brownian liquid ( i.e. , an idealized monodisperse colloidal suspension in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions ) formed by @xmath0 spherical brownian particles interacting between them through direct ( i.e. , conservative ) forces , but in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the resulting general memory function expression for the intermediate scattering function ( isf ) @xmath6 and for its self component @xmath7 , were later employed in the construction of the self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) theory of colloid dynamics @xcite , eventually applied to the description of dynamic arrest phenomena @xcite and more recently @xcite to the construction of a first - principles theory of equilibration and aging of colloidal glass - forming liquids .    with the aim of investigating the relationship between the dynamics of atomic and brownian liquids , here",
    "we start the extension of these theoretical developments to describe the macroscopic dynamics of both kinds of systems within the same theoretical formalism . with this general intention in mind , in the present paper",
    "we discuss the application of the generalized langevin equation formalism above , to the derivation of general memory - function expressions for the ( collective and self ) intermediate scattering functions of an atomic liquid .",
    "these expressions should in principle be capable of describing the crossover behavior of these properties between their ballistic short time limit and their diffusive long - time behavior .",
    "although in practice we do not use these expressions here to numerically evaluate these functions in the short- or intermediate time - regime @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the mean free time ) , we find that in their long - time limit , @xmath10 , these expressions for @xmath6 and @xmath7 become essentially identical to the corresponding expressions for a colloidal fluid , strongly suggesting a well defined long - time dynamic correspondence between atomic and colloidal liquids .",
    "the strategy that we shall employ to derive the memory function equations for the intermediate scattering functions of our model atomic liquid will actually rely very heavily on the referred previous derivation @xcite of the time - evolution equations for @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the corresponding idealized brownian fluid .",
    "the rationale for this is the rather simple observation that the essential difference between an atomic liquid and its idealized brownian counterpart ( a colloidal liquid in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions ) is the presence , in the microscopic equations of motion of the latter , of the friction force @xmath11 due to the supporting solvent and the corresponding fluctuating force @xmath12 .",
    "thus , we first review the derivation of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the aim of keeping track of the effects of these friction terms .",
    "this aspect of the present work is developed in section [ sectionii ] . at the end of the section ,",
    "we simply take the @xmath13 limit of the end result of the referred derivation , to obtain the corresponding time - evolution equations for @xmath6 and @xmath7 of our atomic liquid ( namely , eqs .",
    "( [ fdkz0 ] ) and ( [ fsdkz0 ] ) ) .",
    "the next task of this work is to analyze the long - time limit of these results for @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , dealing with brownian systems , this limit was referred to as the  overdamped \" limit , corresponding to times @xmath14 much longer than the relaxation time @xmath15 of the velocity autocorrelation function .",
    "this relaxation results from the damping of the particle s momentum due to the friction force @xmath11 .",
    "thus , in that case @xmath16 sets the crossover timescale from the early initial regime @xmath17 , where the inertial effects are still important , to the long - time regime @xmath18 , where the motion of the suspended particles is purely diffusive , and described by the short - time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath19 . in contrast , in atomic liquids an analogous timescale is apparently absent , since there is not any material solvent exerting damping friction forces . in spite of that , in section [ sectioniii ] , we analyze the long - time limit of the time - evolution equations for @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the atomic liquid derived in section [ sectionii ] .",
    "we find that in this limit , these equations happen to adopt the same structure as the corresponding equations for brownian systems in their overdamped limit . as a result of this analysis",
    ", we conclude that the parameter playing the role of the short - time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath20 is now the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath21 determined by kinetic theory .",
    "this formal dynamic correspondence has important physical consequences , expressed in terms of well defined scaling properties of the dynamics of two fluid systems which only differ in the microscopic laws that govern the motion of the constituent particles ( either molecular or brownian dynamics ) .",
    "the most relevant of such consequences are briefly discussed in the final section ( section [ sectionv ] ) of this paper .",
    "let us start by reviewing the derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite of the time - evolution equations of @xmath6 and @xmath7 of an idealized monodisperse colloidal suspension in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions , formed by @xmath0 spherical particles in a volume @xmath22 , whose microscopic dynamics is described by the @xmath0-particle langevin equations @xcite @xmath23 in these equations , @xmath24 is the mass and @xmath25 the velocity of the @xmath26th particle , and @xmath27 is its friction coefficient in the absence of interactions . also , @xmath28 is a random force , modeled as a gaussian white noise of zero mean , and variance given by @xmath29 .",

    "our goal is to derive the macroscopic time - evolution equations for the isfs @xmath6 and @xmath33 , starting from this microscopic level of description .",
    "some of the most important features of such general time evolution equations for @xmath6 and @xmath33 can be written , however , right at the outset , since they derive from the general selection rules @xcite originating from the stationarity condition and from other symmetry properties of the macroscopic variables whose dynamics couple to the dynamics of the local particle concentration .",

    "@xcite , which derived the most general time - evolution equation for the fluctuations of the local concentration @xmath34  of colloidal particles , consistent with the selection rules referred to above . the specific information of the microscopic dynamics ,",
    "was then employed in the approximate or partial determination of those elements of the time - evolution equation that such selection rules left undetermined .",
    "this section briefly summarizes the main steps of such derivation .    at each step of the following derivation",
    ", however , we urge the reader to keep track of the particular case in which the friction term @xmath11 and its corresponding fluctuating force @xmath35 are absent , and to recognize that an _ atomic _ liquid can be viewed as the present brownian liquid in the limit of an infinitely tenuous solvent , such that the stokes friction coefficient @xmath36 vanishes . thus , we shall take the limit @xmath37 in the general memory - function expressions for @xmath38 and @xmath7 derived in this section . in such limit",
    "one is left only with the particles in the vacuum , and these equations for @xmath38 and @xmath7 will then become the exact memory function expressions for the isfs of an _ atomic _ liquid .",
    "thus , let us first recall that the basis of the gle formalism are the general mathematical conditions stated by the theorem of stationarity @xcite .",

    "the comparison in this figure , however , is only one particular manifestation of the more general long - time dynamic scaling suggested by the present work , whose applications were also illustrated by the other results presented in this section .",

    "a summary of this analysis has been advanced in a recent brief communication @xcite .",
    "we should mention , in addition , that in reality the validity of the present dynamic correspondence between atomic and colloidal liquids should extend over to colloidal systems involving hydrodynamic interactions , provided that the corresponding effects enter only through the value of the short - time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath245 , which should then play the role of a density - dependent @xmath158 , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "besides analyzing further these important predictions , we are in the process of applying the general expressions for @xmath6 and @xmath7 for an atomic liquid derived in this paper , to the development of a self - consistent scheme to calculate these properties .",
