    "in this paper we develop a model for high energy cosmic rays ( hecrs ; here defined as @xmath8ev / nucleon crs ) , based on the underlying assumption that crs are accelerated in the relativistic and nonrelativistic shocks found in grbs and their attendant supernovae ( sne ) .",

    "a good fit to the entire data set is possible if crs are injected with a power - law spectrum with number index @xmath11 , as could be expected in a scenario where particles are accelerated by relativistic shocks @xcite .",
    "crs that are injected with energies @xmath12 ev diffuse through and escape from their host galaxy .",
    "the sources of high - energy crs , namely grbs , are located in star - forming regions found in the galaxy s disk .",
    "cr transport in the disk and halo of the milky way is modeled using a time - dependent , spherically - symmetric propagation model that employs an energy - dependent , spatially - independent diffusion coefficient .",
    "the random - walk pathlengths are assumed to arise from gyroresonant , pitch - angle scattering of crs with a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence spectra that can be decomposed into two components reflecting different power - law distributions of turbulence over different wavelength ranges .",
    "the spectral break at the cr knee energy is explained in an impulsive , single - source model for hecrs if the turbulence spectral index changes from kraichnan to kolmogorov turbulence near the wavenumber resonant with crs at the knee of the cr spectrum .",
    "we model the preliminary kascade data reported in 2001 by assuming that all ionic species have the same injection index , with the compositions of the ions adjusted to fit the observed cr spectrum near the knee .",
    "additional hardenings of the low - energy cr spectrum from a single grb source of hecrs can result both from energy - dependent diffusion and from a low - energy cutoff in the cr injection spectrum .",
    "superposition of the contributions from many sne are assumed to accelerate the bulk of the gev / nuc  tev / nuc crs , as in the conventional scenario @xcite .",
    "uhecrs have such large gyroradii and diffusion mean free paths that they are assumed to escape directly from the halo of the grb host galaxy and stream into metagalactic space .",

    "the large nonthermal baryon load , @xmath26 , required to fit the uhecr data assuming that the grbs comoving luminosity density traces the star formation rate ( sfr ) history , implies that grbs can be much more luminous neutrino sources than predicted under the standard assumption that the energy injected into a grb blast wave in the form of crs is equal to the energy inferred from x/@xmath7 fluence measurements of grbs @xcite .",
    "we therefore predict that if this model is correct , and crs are accelerated and injected in the form of soft power - laws with index @xmath4 , then icecube should detect up to several neutrinos from the brightest grbs with total x/@xmath7 radiation fluence at levels @xmath27 erg @xmath28 .",

    "lower limits to @xmath29 can be inferred from @xmath7-ray transparency arguments applied to observations of grbs with the _ gamma - ray large area space telescope_.    we also consider whether this model can explain the agasa data @xcite for the uhecrs .",
    "poor fits are found if grbs inject soft cr spectra with @xmath4 .",
    "however , if grbs inject hard spectra with @xmath31 , for example , through a second - order relativistic shock - fermi process @xcite or through the converter mechanism @xcite , then the highest - energy agasa data can be fit , though the reduced @xmath32 of our best fits are not compelling . because the injection spectrum is so hard , most of the produced high - energy neutrinos are too energetic and the flux too weak to be detected with icecube , though other telescope arrays , such as the extreme universe space observatory ( euso ) , could be sensitive to these gzk neutrinos . to explain the crs below @xmath33 ev , an additional component of crs",

    "our treatment of the uhecr attenuation and flux calculation is described in appendix a.",
    "the progenitor sources of hecrs are likely to be grbs , as suggested by the following observations :    1 .",
    "the evidence from kascade @xcite that the break energies of the different cr ionic species are proportional to rigidity , and that the mean atomic mass increases with @xmath40 through the knee region , admits a propagation solution to understand the energies of the spectral breaks of different cr ions  given a galactic source that injects power - law crs to the highest energies .",
    "composition changes above the  second knee \" at @xmath41 ev , and possible gzk features in the uhecr spectrum @xcite , implies that uhecrs and their sources are metagalactic .",

    "provides the simplest solutions .",
    "a comprehensive model of hecrs therefore seems achievable if a source type that injected power - law distributions of relativistic crs were found in star - forming @xmath45 galaxies such as the milky way , with injection episodes frequent and energetic enough to power the hecrs . for reasons reviewed in refs .",

    "based on the study by bttcher and dermer @xcite of batse statistics in the external shock model , a value of @xmath63 was derived @xcite using an analytic fit to the sfr derived from hubble deep field measurements @xcite .",
    "this emissivity includes , in addition to the photon luminosity that is dominated by hard x - ray and @xmath7-ray emission , an inefficiency factor for production of photons due to the radiative regime implied by the fits to the data @xcite , and a further correction for dirty and clean fireballs @xcite , which have since been discovered @xcite .    removing the inefficiency factor from the estimate of ref .",
    "@xcite gives the local grb emissivity in the form of nonthermal photon radiation to be @xmath64 .",

    "frail et al .",
    "@xcite argue that a typical grb has a beaming factor of 1/500@xmath67 of the full sky , so that grbs are in actual fact 500 times more numerous , and 1/500@xmath67 as energetic on average , as the measured energy releases imply .",
    "this means that most grbs typically release @xmath68 ergs in x/@xmath7 emission .",
    "the local density of @xmath45 spiral galaxies , of which the milky way is representative , can be derived from the schechter luminosity function , and is @xmath69(200500 mpc@xmath70 ) @xcite .",
    "the batse observations imply @xmath71 grbs / day over the full sky @xcite . due to beaming , this rate is increased by a factor of @xmath72 , where @xmath73 .",

    "this estimate is in agreement with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite that excludes short grbs .",
    "thus a grb occurs about once every 310 millennia throughout the milky way , or at about 10% of the rate of type ib / c sne .",
    "we write @xmath82 for the local luminosity density of crs injected by grbs , where @xmath83 is the nonthermal baryon - loading factor by which the emissivity injected by grbs in the form of hadronic crs exceeds the emissivity inferred from direct observations of the x/@xmath7 emission from grbs . in the following ,",
    "we take @xmath84 ( eq .  [ l44 ] ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ rhol * ] ) and ( [ elldot ] ) , we find that the average apparent isotropic energy release per grb is @xmath85 ergs , and the smaller actual mean energy release per grb due to beaming and the consequent larger number of grb sources is @xmath86 ergs .",
    "for our canonical model grb used to fit cr data near the knee , we take @xmath87 ergs , corresponding to @xmath88 . a value of @xmath89 is implied by the data fits if this model for hecrs is correct ( section 5 ) .",
    "hence , in a unified model for hecrs from grbs , the grb blast wave must be strongly baryon - loaded with @xmath90 , at least during the prompt phase of the grb when the acceleration is most rapid .",
    "observations indicate that grb sources are located in the disks and star - forming regions of galaxies undergoing active star formation , such as the milky way .",
    "the relativistic ejecta in the grb explosions accelerate and inject crs into the ism of the grb host galaxy in the form of a power law to the highest energies , though possibly with a low - energy cutoff to the accelerated proton spectrum . in relativistic blast waves ,",
    "this cutoff is expected at @xmath91 gev energies , which could easily reach tev ",
    "pev energies for typical grb blast waves with @xmath92  300 .",
    "uhecr acceleration and injection probably occurs during the @xmath7-ray luminous phase of a grb , which is on the order of minutes to hours .",
    "acceleration and injection of lower energy crs might operate on the sedov time scale , which could exceed thousands of years .",
    "these acceleration times are still short compared to the times for particles with the corresponding energies to diffuse a distance comparable to the disk scale height , as can be shown from the diffusion properties of the galaxy derived below .",
    "a grb source can therefore be treated as an impulsive source of cr injection .    in this section",

    "the prediction of our model that the energy output in relativistic protons and nuclei accelerated by relativistic shocks of grbs can be much larger than the total power inferred from the observed x - ray / mev radiation , @xmath237 , suggests a very important conclusion concerning the question of detectability of grbs by forthcoming km - scale neutrino detectors like icecube .",
    "a recent study @xcite of this question shows that , at best , only from the brightest fraction of grbs with neutrino fluence @xmath238 in the prompt phase exceeding @xmath239 erg @xmath28 , would it be possible to detect multi - tev neutrinos by icecube .",
    "this is a general model - independent result which only assumes that the radiation fluence derived from the x - ray / mev @xmath7-ray measurements in the prompt phase of grbs does not strongly underestimate the total radiation output of grbs ( that could be missed at higher energies ) .",
    "this result follows from the direct calculation of the number of muon neutrinos @xmath240 to be expected for a detector like icecube , with an area @xmath241 , assuming a spectral fluence of the neutrinos @xmath242 erg @xmath28 . for a spectrum of @xmath243 with the spectral index @xmath244",

    "thus if the neutrino fluence is comparable to the x/@xmath7 photon fluence , detection of @xmath251 neutrinos could be expected only from very powerful grbs , at a fluence level @xmath252 .",
    "note that @xmath253 corresponds to the neutrino fluence @xmath254 erg @xmath28 integrated per each decade of energy .",
    "note also the decline in the number of neutrinos to be expected per equal energy fluences per decade when @xmath255 .",
    "this is explained by the change in the detection efficiency @xmath256 of upward - going muon neutrinos at this energy ( see @xcite ) , which can be approximated as @xmath257 , where @xmath258 for @xmath248 , and @xmath259 for @xmath260 .",
    "therefore , since a typical spectrum of neutrinos expected from grbs due to photomeson interactions of hecrs extends well beyond 100 tev , detection of even a single neutrino at multi - tev energies would become likely only if the total fluence in the @xmath251 would significantly exceed @xmath239 erg @xmath28 .",
    "meanwhile , the total amount of energy released in the neutrinos ( including @xmath261 ) is only about @xmath262-@xmath263 of the energy of secondaries resulting from photomeson interactions .",
    "therefore at least the same amount of energy is released in the gamma - rays and electrons of multi - tev energies produced in the secondary pion decays . for a blastwave lorentz factor @xmath264 - 300 ,",
    "the grb radiation fields in the prompt phase are typically optically thick to photo - absorption for gamma - rays with energies above the gev domain as is apparent from the curves in fig .",
    "even if one assumes that the radiation in the prompt phase of a grb is contributed only by several individual spikes , with a characteristic duration as large as @xmath265 - 10s , the source becomes transparent to gamma - rays below the gev domain only in case of a collapsar grb with doppler - factor @xmath266 .",
    "therefore most of the energy injected in multi - tev gamma - rays will be efficiently converted to hard radiation in the x - ray to sub - gev gamma - ray domains through the synchro - compton photon - pair cascade developing in the relativistic shock / grb source .",
    "our knowledge of high - energy ( @xmath267 mev ) emission from grbs is limited to 7 grbs detected with the spark chamber on egret @xcite and the milagrito detection of grb 970417a @xcite .",
    "the average spectrum of four grbs detected simultaneously with batse and the egret spark chamber from @xmath268 mev to @xmath179 gev is consistent with a @xmath269 photon number spectrum , implying that in these cases the @xmath267 mev fluence does not exceed the batse fluence by more than a factor of a few .",
    "however , the examples of the prompt and delayed high - energy emission from grb 940217 @xcite , the anomalous hard component detected with batse and the egret tasc from grb 941017 @xcite , and grb 970417a , which required @xmath179 times more energy in the tev range than in the batse range , show that the high - energy behavior of grbs is yet poorly measured and even more poorly understood .",
    "the baseline assumption made here is to require that the energy fluence in neutrinos not exceed the fluence observed in electromagnetic radiation at hard x - ray and soft @xmath7-ray energies .",
    "calculations of the neutrino fluxes expected from grbs in case of baryon - loading factor @xmath270 , i.e. , assuming equal energies for relativistic hadrons and directly accelerated electrons ( which are assumed to produce the observed radiation ) , show that even in the case of very powerful bursts with radiation fluence at the level @xmath271 ergs @xmath28 , which happen only few / several times per year , the probability of detection of neutrinos by a km - scale detector would remain hopelessly small in the framework of the collapsar model unless the doppler factor @xmath272 or the variability time scale @xmath273 s. a significant contribution to the target photon field density from a radiation component external to the grb source / blob , as in the plerionic emission in the `` supranova '' scenario @xcite , or from radiation scattered by the progenitor material in the circumburst environment in the collapsar model , improves chances to detect neutrinos from grbs ( see ref .",

    "this is because for large doppler factors and @xmath274 ergs @xmath28 , only a small fraction of the injected proton energy can be converted into secondaries through photomeson interactions of hecrs with internal photons .",

    "it means that in the light of the arguments given above , the maximum value of the baryon loading that could be allowed if the high - energy radiation fluence is less than the x/@xmath7 fluence for this particular case should be about 8 - 10 , instead of 20 .",

    "another prediction of a hadronically dominated grb model is the possible detection of gamma - rays in the multi - gev energy domain by glast at a stage near the prompt phase when the density of radiation fields would still be sufficient for extraction of a small fraction of the energy of accelerated protons , but when the secondary gamma - rays would not be suppressed by the photo - absorption process . in case of relatively close grbs , with @xmath313 , these gamma - rays",

    "our model explains , moreover , cr data not only through the first and second knees but also at the highest energies .    the turbulence spectrum that fits the cr spectrum near the knee employs a kraichnan spectrum at small wavenumbers and a kolmogorov spectrum at large wavenumbers .",
    "turbulence is thought to be generated at the smallest wavenumbers or largest size scales , with subsequent energy cascading to smaller size scales @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are two crucial length scales in our turbulence spectrum , namely @xmath320 pc , and @xmath321 pc .",
    "the generation of turbulence in the disk and halo of the galaxy at the larger size scale could be associated with halo - disk interactions ( e.g. , through the interactions of high - velocity clouds with the galactic disk ) , which would deposit turbulence throughout the disk and the halo of the galaxy on a size scale @xmath322 pc .",
