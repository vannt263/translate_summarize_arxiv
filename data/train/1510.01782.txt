    "we consider an infinitely long cylindrical pore of radius @xmath10 , and we study the equilibrium phases in ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory and identify their signatures in nonlinear nmr spectroscopy . by incorporating pressure dependent strong - coupling corrections to the gl material coefficients , and a tuneable pairbreaking boundary condition",
    ", we obtain phase diagrams as functions of temperature , pressure , and surface condition .",
    "finally , we derive expressions for the transverse nmr frequency shifts of the equilibrium phases of @xmath1he confined in the pore as functions of _ rf _ pulse driven tipping angle , and show how they vary with order parameter symmetry and orientation of the static magnetic field .",
    "we use ginzburg - landau theory calculations of the superfluid @xmath1he order parameter and free energy to determine the stable phases present in the pore . the order parameter for superfluid @xmath1he , given by the manifold of spin - triplet , p - wave bcs pairing states ,",

    "the presence of boundaries reduces the possible residual orbital symmetries of the superfluid phases to be elements of the point group of the confining cylindrical geometry . however , this reduction in symmetry is due to interactions atomically close to the boundary surface ; away from the surface , the @xmath1he particle - particle interactions are still invariant under the maximal symmetry group of bulk @xmath1he .",
