    "binarity is a very common stellar property , which covers a very wide range of separations , from two stellar radii to thousands of astronomical units .",
    "close binaries have short orbital periods ( from a few hours to a few years ) , and they are easily detected from variations in their radial velocities ( rv ) .",
    "for that reason , they are the most commonly studied of this class of stars ( see , eg , @xcite ) .",
    "binaries with periods around a few centuries are also rather well known : the components are sufficiently separated to be detected visually ( in the past ) or on images , and they are still close enough to avoid the risk of confusing a field star and a binary component : they may be discarded by applying a statistical criterion almost as old as the discovery of double stars @xcite .",
    "very wide binaries are particularly interesting , since the distribution of their separations is a clue to the gravitational perturbers which made the gravity field of the galaxy ( see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". however , the selection of binaries with separations of thousands of astronomical units is difficult : the components have also wide apparent separations , and it is necessary to use additional criteria in order to discard the optical companions .",
    "trigonometric parallax , or another estimation of the distance , is sometimes used , but the most efficient , and the most employed criterion is proper motion : when the semi - major axis of the orbit is large , the orbital motion of the stars around the barycentre of the system generates a difference in proper motion which is negligible , and the components must have similar apparent displacements .",
    "such binaries are called common proper motion ( cpm ) stars .    in the past , this criterion was used by luyten to search for wide systems by visual inspection of photographic plates ; his prospect was performed over more than 40 years , from @xcite to @xcite and led to the discovery of 6121 systems . however , despite their large number , these systems were not used to derive the properties of wide binaries ; the main reason is that the selection was based on subjective criteria , and , as a consequence , it would be hard to estimate its incompleteness , and also the contamination by optical pairs .",
    "moreover , since the components of luyten s double stars are rather faint ( around 16th magnitude ) , it would be difficult to improve the selection with complementary data .",
    "another selection of cpm pairs was performed by @xcite , on the basis of the agk2/3 catalogue @xcite .",
    "four hundred and thirty - nine cpm double stars were selected , and the number of optical pairs was estimated to be around 40 . since the agk3 stars are brighter than 12th magnitude , it was decided to select the physical binaries on the basis of the rv of the components . as is the case for the proper motions ,",
    "the rv are marginally affected by the orbital motion , and the components of wide binaries are therefore also common rv stars .",
    "two hundred and sixty - six stars were selected , and they were measured with the spectrovelocimeter coravel .",
    "this programme was initiated in 1986 , and it was initially supposed to end after a few years . however , several stars had variable velocities , since these wide pair components were themselves spectroscopic binaries ( sb ) .",
    "it was then necessary to extend the observations over about 20 years , in order to derive the sb orbital elements , and thus the systemic velocity of these stars .",
    "the present paper is devoted to these variable velocity stars , and to the derivation of their sb elements .",
    "the selection of the wide binaries and the derivation of their statistical properties will be treated in a second paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the rv observations are presented in section  [ sec : rv ] , and the catalogue of the rv measurements is in section  [ sec : rvcat ] .",
    "the calculation of the sb orbits is in section  [ sec : sb ] ; for the double  lined sb ( sb2 ) , we present a method to take into account the measurements related to blends of the two components .",
    "some interesting points relating to the new sb that we have discovered are discussed in the conclusion , section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the observational programme concerned a large part of the cpm stars listed in @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the cpm stars were presented in two tables , according to the time @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the apparent separation and @xmath2 is the proper motion of the pair of stars .",
    "three hundred and twenty - six pairs of cpm stars with @xmath3  years are listed in the first table , and the estimated frequency of optical pairs is only 1.3  % .",
    "the second table contains 113 cpm pairs with @xmath4 between 1000 and 3500 years ; this range corresponds to an expected frequency of optical pairs of 40  % .",
    "since the proportion of optical pairs is rather important in the second table , all these 113 cpm pairs were selected in a first step .",
    "for the first table , it was decided to observe only the components of pairs with a primary brighter than 9.15 mag .",
    "this limit was chosen since it appeared that the agk 2/3 is not complete beyond that magnitude .",
    "the spectrovelocimeter coravel @xcite is installed on the swiss 1-m telescope , at the observatory of haute - provence ( ohp ) . for slow rotators with spectral types around k0",
    ", it may provide rv measurements with a precision around 0.3  km / s .",
    "however , it becomes inefficient for stars earlier than f5 , except when their spectra contain metallic lines .",
    "therefore , it is possible to get rv with a precision near 1  km / s for the am  type stars .",
    "due to this restriction , our final programme contains 266 stars observable with coravel : 90 are extracted from the first table , and 176 from the second one .",
    "the programme started in 1986 , but several stars were already measured with coravel at this time .",
    "the observations of the stars with a constant velocity were stopped after 1 or 2 years , but several sb were detected , and it was necessary to prolong the programme in order to cover their periods and to derive their orbital elements .",
    "in practice , when a sb was observed , its wide companion was usually observed too .",
    "the coravel observations were performed until the decommissioning of that instrument in 2000 .",
    "they led to the detection of 66 stars with variable radial velocity , according to the @xmath5 test at the 1  % threshold .      in 2007",
    ", we had the opportunity to obtain very accurate rv measurements with the sophie spectrograph installed on the 1.93  m telescope at ohp @xcite .",
    "ten stars with variable rv , but for which it was still not possible to derive an orbit , were observed in _ service mode _ during 2 semesters .",
    "the spectra were registered in high  resolution mode with a signal - to - noise ratio between 20 and 200 , depending on the brightness of the star .",
    "thanks to the sophie automatic pipeline , they were cross  correlated with a mask close to the actual spectral type of the star . for the single - lined binaries ( sb1 ) ,",
    "the rv was directly obtained from the pipeline . for two sb2 , the cross  correlation function ( ccf ) was fitted with two normal distributions in order to derive the velocities of both components .",
    "the automatic pipeline provides also rv uncertainties , but they are obviously underestimated .",
    "@xcite estimate that 3 terms must be quadratically added : the instrumental drift is around 3  m  s@xmath6 , the guiding error is around 4  m  s@xmath6 , and they derived from their own observations an additional error of 8  m  s@xmath6 .",
    "we finally obtain an additional error of 9.4  m  s@xmath6 , that is rounded up to 10  m  s@xmath6 .",
    "it is worth noticing that this error does not apply to the radial velocity with respect to the sun , but to variations of rv due to an exoplanetary companion , ie to rv fluctuations over a range not larger than around 100  m  s@xmath6 .",
    "since we are observing sb with stellar components , the semi - amplitude of the rv is as large as several km  s@xmath6 , and the error could be larger than 10  m  s@xmath6 .",
    "moreover , we must introduce an offset between the coravel measurements and the sophie measurements .",
    "this offset depends on the star , and on the mask used in the sophie reduction .",
    "it may be computed with the orbital elements when several sophie measurements are available , but , for a single measurement , it results in an error of 0.3  km  s@xmath6 , to a rough estimation .",
    "in addition to the observations performed with coravel and with sophie , we still obtained 3 measurements from two other telescopes : the euler telescope with the coralie spectrovelocimeter , in la silla , and the 1  m telescope of the simeis observatory in crimea .",
    "finally , 2275 measurements were obtained for the 66 stars that were selected as variable or probably variable .",
    "the measurements are gathered in one plain text file , with one header record preceding the rv of each star .",
    "each header contains :    * _ cpm _ , the identification of the star in @xcite , which consists in the number of the list , followed by the number of the pair , followed by `` a '' or `` b '' for the component . * _ ag _ , the ag identification .",
    "* @xmath7 , the color index assumed in the derivation of the coravel radial velocities . * @xmath8 , the number of measurements following the header . *",
    "@xmath9 , the mean radial velocity of the star .",
    "when a spectroscopic orbit was derived , as indicated by a `` o '' in the variability status , @xmath9 is the velocity of the system .",
    "otherwise , it is an average of the coravel measurements with a zero or a blank in the `` c '' column of table  [ tab : mesrv ] , as explained in section  [ sec : sbnoorb ] .",
    "* @xmath10 , the uncertainty of @xmath9 . *",
    "@xmath5 , the probability to get a @xmath11 larger than the one actually obtained , assuming the rv is constant in reality .",
    "the @xmath11 was computed from the coravel measurements of the primary component . *",
    "the final variability status of the star .",
    "the following status were found : `` cst ? '' for a star which could have a constant rv , `` var '' when the rv seems to be variable , `` sb1 '' or `` sb2 '' when at least a part of the velocity curve is visible , `` sb1o '' and `` sb2o '' when the orbital elements were derived . *",
    "a `` @xmath12 '' follows the variability status sb1o or sb2o when rv measurements from an external source were taken into account to derive the orbital elements .",
    "these additional measurements were found in the sb9 on - line catalogue @xcite ; they are not reproduced here , but the references are given in the notes , section  [ sec : notes ] .",
    "* the right ascension of the `` a '' component , in hours and minutes , is given in order to facilitate the search of the stars .",
    "some headers are presented in table  [ tab : header ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,>,^,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in table  [ tab : vmoy ] , we count 15 stars for which it was not possible to derive a spectroscopic orbit . in addition , we still found two triple systems ( 2:16a and 2:98b ) , with a short - period sb and a drift in the residual rv .",
    "the figures showing the radial velocities of these 17 stars as functions of the epochs are given in electronic form .",
    "in addition to the two triple systems already mentioned , we still count 7 long period sb1 ( 2:8b , 2:14a , 2:15a , 2:21b , 1:156b , 2:81b and 2:89a ) , and two long period sb2 ( 1:130a and 2:87a ) .",
    "the remaining stars are a pulsating variable ( 2:5b ) , 3 stars for which we obtained too few measurements ( 2:24b , 1:90a , 2:62a ) , and 2 stars that are probably not variable ( 2:91b and 2:99b ) .",
    "these objects are discussed in the notes in section  [ sec : notes ] hereafter .",
    "the average velocities of these stars , given in table  [ tab : vmoy ] , are derived from the coravel measurements only , since the offset between coravel and another system , like sophie , can not be computed . moreover , for the sb2 , only the blended measurements are taken into account .",
    "the estimation of the uncertainty of the systemic rv is puzzling , since we even do not know when the range of the rv variations was entirely covered with our measurements . as a consequence , and unlike the case for a constant star , the actual error of @xmath13 is not varying as the square root of the number of the measurements .",
    "therefore , we finally chose to assume as error the standard deviation of the rv measurements .      * 2:5a * = bd + 45 172 .",
    "four sophie measurements were taken into account for each component .",
    "a correction of 3  m  s@xmath6 was added to our original estimation of the rv calculated by fitting two gaussian curves to the sophie ccf .    * 2:5b * = bd + 45 171 .",
    "the star is a semi - regular pulsating variable , and the rv variations are probably not due to orbital motion .    * 2:8b * = bd -01 133 .",
    "this star was suspected to be a long period sb1 on the basis of the coravel measurements .",

    "the coravel measurements suggest a long period , and the average velocity of the sophie measurements confirms this hypothesis .",
    "a very preliminary orbit was thus derived , with @xmath15  days , @xmath16  jd , @xmath17 , @xmath18  km  s@xmath6 and @xmath19  km  s@xmath6 , but it does not look reliable , since the period is very uncertain .",
