    "the aqueous phase of cell cytoplasm is crowded with macromolecules such as soluble proteins , nucleic acids and membranes @xcite .",
    "the influence of such crowding on biochemical reactions inside physiological media are manifold @xcite . due to crowding ,",
    "the average free energy @xmath0 of a nonspecific interaction between any molecule in the medium and a crowding molecule may change considerably which may influence the reaction activity @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath3 is the absolute temperature .",
    "steric repulsion is the most fundamental of all interactions between macromolecules in solution at finite concentration and as an effect of such repulsion the macromolecules occupy a substantial volume fraction in the cell interior @xcite",
    ". significant volume fraction of macromolecules in the medium imposes a constraint on introducing any new macromolecule . as a consequence of crowding ,",
    "macromolecular association reactions become increasingly favorable . because of crowding",
    ", the molecular diffusion in the medium is expected to be anomalous @xcite .",
    "the effect of macromolecular crowding on different kinetic steps of enzyme catalysis such as formation of enzyme - substrate complex and enzyme - product complex were analyzed through different equilibrium thermodynamic models@xcite .",
    "a number of approaches have been proposed to study the effects of macromolecular crowding on the reaction kinetic rate laws such as the law of mass action @xcite , fractal like kinetics @xcite , the power law approximation @xcite , stochastic simulation@xcite and lattice gas simulation@xcite . in these analytic and numerical models ,",
    "the influence of macromolecular crowding on both equilibrium thermodynamics and reaction rates were addressed and it was observed that the rate decays exponentially with time as expected in equilibrium kinetics .",
    "the influence of macromolecular crowding on the enzymatic reaction rates has been investigated experimentally using a variety of crowding agents @xcite .",
    "these studies have also indicated a significant influence of crowding on the rate parameters of the enzymatic reaction .",
    "it was found that the effect of crowding on the enzymatic reaction may be different depending on whether the product formation in the enzyme reaction is limited by the diffusional encounter of substrate and enzyme or the formation of the transition state complex , an association of enzyme and substrate .",
    "moreover , molecular diffusion is known to be the major determinant of many cellular processes and plays a key role in cell metabolism where the encounter of the free substrate with an active site of the enzyme is often the rate determining step .",
    "however , how the kinetics of an enzymatic reaction is dependent on the size and concentration of the crowding macromolecules is still not fully understood .",
    "the macromolecular crowding till date remains under appreciated and neglected aspect of the intracellular environment @xcite .",
    "it is hence essential to understand the experimental observations from microscopic origin .    in this paper ,",
    "an approach based on non - equilibrium dynamics of enzymatic reactions in the diffusion limited regime is considered .",
    "the aim is to understand qualitatively the influence of inert macromolecular crowding on the diffusion limited enzymatic reactions governed by non - equilibrium thermodynamics . a simple numerical model in two dimensions ( @xmath4 ) based on molecular diffusion in disordered systems coupled with enzymatic reaction is proposed here .",
    "the disordered system is modeled by percolation clusters @xcite .",
    "it is predicted that the rate of a diffusion - limited enzyme - catalyzed reaction will experience a monotonic decrease with increase in the fractional volume occupancy of the crowding agent .",
    "the model explains qualitatively certain experimental observations .",
    "in brief , the enzyme kinetic reaction in the cell cytoplasm can be described as substrate molecules diffusing through crowding macromolecules and binding to the active site of the freely floating enzymes .",
    "subsequently a product is formed if the reaction is energetically favorable and this product diffuses through the same crowd of macromolecules .",
    "the classical michaelis - menten equilibrium enzyme kinetic reaction is given as @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents enzyme , @xmath7 represents substrate , @xmath8 represents product and @xmath9 is the intermediate enzyme - substrate complex .    in the present model ,",
    "the reaction is limited by diffusion only and the formation of the transition state complex @xmath9 is not taken into account .",
    "the conversion of substrate to product is also assumed to be instantaneous . note that diffusion has the slowest time scale in this problem .",
    "hence , the above enzymatic reaction reduces to an irreversible one as @xmath10 the final equilibrium state corresponds to conversion of all substrates to products .",
    "a monte carlo ( mc ) algorithm has been developed to study diffusion limited enzymatic reaction as in eq.[eq2 ] in the presence of inert macromolecules .",
    "the algorithm is developed on the @xmath4 square lattice of size @xmath11 . for simplicity ,",
    "the motion of the macromolecules is ignored and these act as immobile and inert obstacles .",
    "the inert obstacles do not interact with either among themselves or with the substrate or product .",
    "the obstacles ( @xmath12 ) , enzyme ( @xmath6 ) , substrate ( @xmath7 ) and product ( @xmath8 ) are all represented as point particles in this model .",
    "it is also assumed that there exists only one immobile enzyme in the whole system .",
    "the enzyme is placed at the center of the lattice . after placing the enzyme , the obstacles and the substrates",
    "are distributed randomly over the lattice sites with their specified concentrations @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "a random number @xmath15 is called from a uniform distribution of random numbers between @xmath16 and @xmath17 corresponding to each lattice site .",
    "if @xmath18 , the site is occupied with a substrate and if @xmath19 the site is occupied with an obstacle where @xmath20 is the area fraction .",
    "the excluded volume condition is maintained , _",
    "i.e. _ , at any instant of time one lattice site can not be occupied by more than one molecule of the same or different species .",
    "the substrate molecules diffuse through the space not occupied by the obstacles which will be referred as empty space later .",
    "as soon as a @xmath7 reaches @xmath6 , a product @xmath8 is produced with unit probability .",
    "the diffusion of substrate or product in the system is modeled by simple random walk in presence of obstacles or disorder . at each mc time step ,",
    "all the random walkers ( all @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) make an attempt to move to one of their nearest neighbors .",
    "the destination site , a site out of the four neighbors , of a random walker is chosen calling a random number @xmath15 uniformly distributed between @xmath16 and @xmath17 . with respect to the present site",
    ", the destination site is going to be on the left if @xmath21 , it is at the top if @xmath22 , it is on the right if @xmath23 , and it is at the bottom if @xmath24",
    ". the destination site could be either empty or occupied by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath12 or @xmath6 .",
    "depending on the status of the destination site , there are then four possibilities : ( @xmath25 ) if the destination site is empty , the present @xmath7 or @xmath8 moves to the destination site , ( @xmath26 ) if the destination site is occupied by a @xmath7 or @xmath8 , @xmath7 or @xmath8 remains on the same site , ( @xmath27 ) if the destination site is occupied by an @xmath12 , @xmath8 or @xmath7 also remains on the same site , and ( @xmath28 ) if the destination site is occupied by the enzyme @xmath6 , @xmath8 remains on the same site but @xmath7 is converted to @xmath8 with unit probability .",
    "if all the molecules of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are checked for an attempt of motion , time @xmath29 ( the mc time step ) is increased to @xmath30 .",
    "to ensure percolation of the substrate molecules , the maximum area fraction @xmath20 is taken as @xmath31 , far below the percolation threshold .",
    "note that , the percolation threshold on the square lattice is @xmath32 @xcite . note that , the present non - equilibrium diffusion limited enzymatic reaction model is substantially different from that of lattice gas model incorporating equilibrium reaction rates proposed by schnell and turner @xcite which leads to an unusual equilibrium constant equal to zero in the crowed environment @xcite .",
    "cyclic boundary condition has been applied in the motion of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the simulation has been performed upto @xmath33 mc time steps on a @xmath34 square lattice .",
    "the data are averaged over @xmath35 ensembles .",
    "the time evolution of the system morphology for @xmath36 with @xmath37 is shown in fig.[fig : pic1 ] at three different time .",
    "the black dots represent the substrates and the gray boxes represent the products . for clarity obstacles",
    "are not shown .",
    "it can be seen that the initial black dots are converted to gray boxes at the end .",
    "that means , the substrate molecules are diffusing , reacting with the enzyme , and are getting converted into products . in time , almost all the substrate molecules are converted to products and the product molecules also diffuse and spread all over the space uniformly .",
    "lin and coworkers @xcite simulated some elementary kinetic reactions like @xmath38 with no obstacles under reflective boundary condition and observed zeldovich crossover ( segregation of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) @xcite .",
    "such segregation is not observed with periodic boundary condition in the present simulation .",
    "effect of impenetrable boundary on diffusion limited reaction like @xmath41 leads to different behavior depending on different boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "( @xmath25 ) @xmath42 ( @xmath26 ) @xmath43 ( @xmath27 ) @xmath44",
    "classical diffusion of a tracer particle in disordered systems has already been studied extensively and the results are well understood @xcite . generally the diffusion is modeled by random walk and the disordered system is modeled by spanning percolation clusters @xcite . for studying diffusion ,",
    "a quantity of interest is the root mean square ( rms ) distance @xmath45 covered by the diffusing particle in time @xmath29 .",
    "the rms distance @xmath45 in @xmath4 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the diffusivity of the system .",
    "the exponent @xmath48 has a value @xmath49 for diffusion on a regular lattice in the @xmath50 limit . on the percolation cluster",
    ", diffusion is found to be anomalous and the value of @xmath48 becomes less than @xmath49@xcite .",
    "the enzyme kinetic reaction inside a cell cytoplasm involves ( @xmath51 ) diffusion of a large number of substrate molecules through the random structure of inert macromolecules , ( @xmath52 ) reaction with the enzyme to have products , and ( @xmath53 ) finally diffusion of products from the enzyme through the same macromolecular crowding .",
    "the diffusion process involved here is then a collective motion of a large number of particles in presence of disorder which is a complicated process than diffusion of a single tracer particle in a disordered medium .",
    "self - diffusion is expected to play a nontrivial role along with the diffusion of @xmath7 or @xmath8 in presence of disorder in these systems . in order to check whether the enzyme kinetic reaction considered here is diffusion limited or not , one needs to analyze the the diffusive behavior of either the substrates or the products . to calculate the average diffusion length of the product particles , the coordinates @xmath54 of each product @xmath51",
    "is recorded with time @xmath29 .",
    "time is measured starting from the birth of a product .",
    "the rms distance @xmath45 traveled in time @xmath29 is then calculated as @xmath55\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the coordinate of the enzyme at the center of the lattice , @xmath57 is number of products of age @xmath29 .",
    "the data is then sample averaged over @xmath35 ensembles .    in fig.[fig :",
    "diff](@xmath25 ) , @xmath45 is plotted against time @xmath29 in double logarithmic scale for different area fractions @xmath20 keeping the substrate concentration constant at @xmath37 .",
    "it can be seen that the magnitude of the diffusion length decreases with increasing @xmath58 .",
    "the collective motion of the particles is then affected more and more by the presence of increasing inert macromolecules in the system . however , in order to check the diffusive behavior of the particles one needs to estimate the exponent @xmath48 defined in eq.[eq : diff ] .",
    "the local slope @xmath59 of the curve @xmath60 versus @xmath61 is determined by employing central difference method . in fig.[fig : diff](@xmath26 ) and @xmath62 , @xmath63 is plotted against time @xmath29 for two different substrate concentrations @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath37 @xmath62 for the same set of area fractions @xmath58 as in fig.[fig : diff](@xmath25 ) . the value of @xmath63 saturates to @xmath49 starting from a smaller value as @xmath29 tends to a large value .",
    "thus , a crossover from sub - diffusive to diffusive behavior has occurred for all area fractions in the long time limit . in the case of low substrate concentration @xmath66 and high area fraction @xmath67",
    ", @xmath63 shows certain anomalous behavior .",
    "note that , at this parameter regime the macromolecular concentration is @xmath68 which is just below @xmath69 since the percolation threshold for a @xmath4 square lattice is @xmath70 .",
    "the empty sites provides the connectivity for the substrate molecules all over the lattice .",
    "however , @xmath71 is defined on a infinitely large system . for a smaller system , even at the concentration of @xmath68 the connectivity of empty sites",
    "may be lost for some of the ensembles considered .",
    "consequently , the product may be trapped in a localized region around the enzyme and this may be the reason behind the anomalous behavior observed in this parameter regime .",
    "since the parameter regime here is limited by diffusion , the enzyme kinetic reaction is then expected to be diffusion limited . due to the enzyme kinetic reaction ( given in eq.[eq2 ] ) the substrates are converted to products in time with unit probability on their encounter . in order to characterize the enzyme kinetic reaction , the number of products @xmath72 are counted as function of time @xmath29 , the mc time step , for different substrate concentrations @xmath14 and area fractions @xmath20 . in fig.[fig : np ] , the product numbers @xmath72 is plotted against time @xmath29 for different area fractions @xmath58 with @xmath37 .",
    "initially , @xmath72 increases linearly , then slows down and finally saturates in the long time limit . for low area fraction",
    ", it can be seen that the reaction is almost complete _ i.e. _ ; most of the substrates given initially , @xmath73 , are converted to products exponentially as in classical equilibrium michaelis - menten kinetics though in the present model a non - equilibrium kinetics is considered .",
    "however , note that there is a considerable decrease in the product yield with increase in area fraction and their profiles are found not to follow an exponential increase .",
    "it has already been predicted by numerical simulations that classical michaelis - menten kinetics may not apply to enzymatic reactions in crowded media@xcite . in a @xmath74 model of reaction diffusion with disorder , doussal and",
    "monthus @xcite also found large time decay in the species density via real space renormalization group calculations .",
    "the macromolecular crowding then could have a considerable and nontrivial effect on the enzymatic reaction rate .",
    "initial rate of enzymatic reactions determines most of the molecular process and thus is an important quantity to estimate .",
    "since non - equilibrium enzymatic reaction is considered here , the reaction rate @xmath75 is defined as the ratio of the number of products @xmath72 to time @xmath29 for @xmath76 conversion of the substrates .",
    "@xmath75 is then sample averaged .",
    "a similar analysis has also been performed for @xmath72 versus @xmath29 plots corresponding to @xmath77 for different area fractions @xmath58 . in fig.[fig : rr](@xmath25 ) , the normalized reaction rate @xmath78 is plotted against obstacle concentration @xmath13 for two different substrate concentrations @xmath37 ( circles ) and @xmath77 ( squares ) . note that , area fraction @xmath20 is not a good parameter to study the reaction rate since @xmath58 will remain finite for finite @xmath14 even at @xmath79 . in the inset ,",
    "@xmath80 is also plotted against @xmath13 in semi logarithmic scale .",
    "there are few things to notice .",
    "first , the reaction rate is decreasing with the increase in obstacle concentration @xmath13 in a nonlinear fashion .",
    "second , the reaction rates are different for a particular @xmath13 even after normalizing by the substrate concentration @xmath14 .",
    "third , there is a monotonic decrease of @xmath81 for small @xmath13 and deviates from linear decrease for large @xmath13 .",
    "the decrease in reaction rate with increasing crowding concentration is expected and also observed in experiments @xcite . however , the dependence of the rate on the crowding concentration is different form the prediction made by minton @xcite in the transition state as well as diffusion limited enzymatic reaction in which a hump in the @xmath81 versus @xmath13 curve is expected for an intermediate @xmath13 .",
    "fourth , the normalized reaction rate is going to zero as @xmath13 approaches @xmath82 . beyond @xmath83",
    ", the obstacles could block the spanning clusters of the empty sites .",
    "consequently the enzymatic reaction will be localized and the reaction rate is expected to go to zero .",
    "the above observations can qualitatively be understood in terms of diffusion and percolation phenomena .",
    "as @xmath13 increases , diffusivity is expected to decrease because of the crowding due to obstacles .",
    "the influence of macromolecular crowding on the diffusion of solutes has been investigated in recent experiments utilizing different crowding agents and a reduced solute diffusion coefficient was observed with increasing size and concentration of crowding macromolecules @xcite .",
    "an estimate of diffusivity @xmath84 ( as given in eq.[eq : diff ] ) has been made utilizing the data of diffusion length @xmath45 for different sets of substrate @xmath85 and obstacle @xmath86 concentrations . in fig.[fig : rr](@xmath26 ) , @xmath47 is plotted against @xmath13 for @xmath37 ( circles ) and @xmath64 ( squares ) . like reaction rate , diffusivity @xmath47",
    "is also studied as a function of obstacle concentration @xmath13 instead of @xmath58 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath47 also decreases with @xmath13 in a nonlinear fashion .",
    "first of all , it is interesting to note that the whole dependence of @xmath80 on @xmath13 is is in accordance with the behavior of @xmath47 with @xmath13 .",
    "the enzymatic reaction rate in this parameter regime is therefore mostly governed by diffusion and can be considered a purely diffusion limited enzymatic reaction .",
    "it is important now to consider the low @xmath13 values , especially the case of @xmath79 . for low @xmath13 values",
    ", @xmath47 is slightly less for @xmath77 than that of @xmath37 for the same @xmath13 .",
    "this slight decrease in @xmath47 is due to diffusion through the self crowding at higher @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "the reaction rate at zero obstacle concentration is expected to be proportional to @xmath14 and @xmath47 and @xmath75 can be obtained as @xmath87 .",
    "it can be seen that the normalized reaction rate @xmath80 obtained here is very close to the corresponding values of @xmath47 at @xmath79 for both the @xmath14 values . at @xmath79 ,",
    "the self diffusion of the substrate molecules eventually determines the reaction rates and might be responsible for a slight decrease in @xmath80 for @xmath77 with respect to @xmath37 as seen in fig.[fig :",
    "rr](@xmath25 ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath14 in absence of obstacles has been verified numerically for several higher values of @xmath14 and a considerable effect of self - crowding has been observed on the reaction rate as well as on diffusivity .",
    "note that , @xmath80 values are slightly greater than @xmath47 for almost all values of @xmath13 as it can be seen by comparing fig.[fig : rr](@xmath25 ) and @xmath65 .",
    "this might have happened firstly due to the fact that the initial yield occur only from the locally available substrate molecules .",
    "the diffusion length of these substrate molecules are very less in comparison to the expected diffusion length .",
    "secondly , one should note that the initial reaction rate for a given @xmath13 has to be calculated keeping the substrate concentration @xmath14 fixed .",
    "however , in the present model the substrate concentration is decreasing with time as the substrates are being converted into products .",
    "the effect will be predominant for low @xmath14 and small system size .",
    "consequently the rate determination will be erroneous in the @xmath88 limit due to low yield .",
    "hence , extreme care has to be taken in determining the initial reaction rate .",
    "the enzymatic reaction considered here is the completely diffusion limited and the results obtained are explainable in terms of diffusion in disordered systems .",
    "it is therefore intriguing to note that such a simple model of enzymatic reaction based on diffusion and percolation phenomena only , is able to explain qualitatively the experimental observations @xcite as well as results obtained in complicated models @xcite .",
    "hence , diffusion is observed to be playing the crucial role in determining the enzymatic reaction rates .",
    "it should be emphasized here that enzymatic reactions occur in @xmath89-dimensional space in living systems whereas the simulation is performed in @xmath90-dimensions here .",
    "the simulation results obtained here agree qualitatively with the experimental observations and it is expected that the features of the model will be retained in higher dimensions also .",
    "the main difficulty in @xmath91 simulation is in parallel updating of a large number of substrate and product molecules during time evolution through a large number of mc time steps .",
    "time required for the full conversion of substrate to product increases exponentially with the number of molecules ( @xmath92 ) which strongly depends on the dimensionality of space for a fixed substrate concentration .",
    "however , for quantitative comparison of the results obtained in simulation with that of experiments , the model must be extended to three dimensions .",
    "the biochemical events in the densely crowded mitochondrial matrix , the site for tca cycle and fatty acid oxidation pathway are largely governed by large macromolecules of various sizes .",
    "it is thus important to investigate the influence of crowding as exerted by macromolecules of different sizes .",
    "a decrease in reaction rate has been observed in experiments for varying obstacle sizes keeping the obstacle concentration constant@xcite .",
    "it seems that the complex interaction between obstacles and the substrate is size dependent and might be governing the enzymatic reaction rate .",
    "it is expected that the diffusion of substrates across large macromolecules might be slow due to the complex interactions with the obstacles . in the present model of enzymatic reaction , this complex interaction between obstacle and substrate may be incorporated by introducing a residence time for the substrate molecules at each encounter with the obstacle . a slowing down in the reaction rate with increasing residence time has been observed in the simulation in accordance with the experimental results @xcite . the details will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the effect of macromolecular crowding on the enzymatic reaction rates has been modeled by a mc algorithm based on diffusion and percolation phenomena .",
    "the substrates , products , obstacles and enzyme all are represented by point particles .",
    "a single immobile enzyme is considered and placed at the center of the lattice .",
    "the obstacles and the substrates are distributed randomly with their specific concentrations following a uniform distribution of random numbers between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the obstacles remain immobile throughout the simulation .",
    "it is found that the reaction is solely diffusion limited under these conditions .",
    "the diffusion of substrates and products are modeled by a collective random walk .",
    "the products form gradually and subsequently almost all the substrates are converted into products after a long time .",
    "the initial reaction rate has been estimated for different substrate and obstacle concentrations .",
    "the normalized reaction rate has a nonlinear dependence on the obstacle concentration and found slightly dependent on the substrate concentration .",
    "the dependence of reaction rate on the substrate as well as obstacle concentrations is then qualitatively understood with the help of diffusion and percolation theory .",
