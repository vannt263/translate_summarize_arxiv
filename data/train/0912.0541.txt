    "* ) , and that the velocity inferred from the line width is consistent with virialized motion .    motivated by these observations , we adopt the following simple model for the blr around a single bh . for a single bh , we uniformly populate clouds as test particles within a spherical shell with inner and outer radii @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the radius in eq.([eqn : blr_size ] ) , i.e. , the flux or ionization parameter ( assuming constant electron density ) required to photoionize a particular line species in the blr clouds is roughly constant within @xmath42 ( the exact value of the percentage does not change our conclusions ) .",

    "we evolve the keplerian orbits of these clouds in the single bh system using standard analytical formulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the system quickly establishes a quasi - steady state configuration where the spatial and velocity distributions converge after @xmath45 ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : t_orb ] ) .",
    "the resulting quasi - steady - state distributions are taken as the initial cloud distributions around a single bh ) of clouds on hyperbolic orbits in the initial distributions , since such clouds will either be bound in the binary system , or will escape to large distances and not contribute to line emission anyway .",
    "we verified that removing these clouds does not have any effect on the derived line profiles . ] .",
    "these clouds have a radial distribution peaked around the initial shell location but also extend to larger and smaller radii , and the gaussianity of their velocity distribution is mostly preserved .",
    "we generate 5000 test particles for each bh .",
    "as discussed later , the sporadic snapshots of these test particle trajectories will be combined to compute the cloud distributions in a binary system .",
    "the resulting line profiles are very smooth even though the total number of test particles used is modest .",
    "this simple model for the blr around a single bh is highly idealized , given the limited understandings of actual blr properties .",
    "it nevertheless reproduces line profiles and characteristic blr sizes that are consistent with observations .",
    "we have assumed that only clouds at a narrow range of distances from the bh can be line - emitting and constitute the blr . in reality",
    "the blr in some agns could have a larger spatial extent , as inferred in some ( albeit limited ) reverberation mapping studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this can be understood if the electron density in the blr varies with radius , so that the flux ( @xmath46 ) required to produce the proper ionization parameter also has a larger range in photoionization models .",
    "however , given the small scatter in the mean @xmath18 relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our fiducial choice of a relatively thin shell geometry for the blr should be a reasonable approximation at least for the majority of the line - emitting clouds in the blr .",
    "one caveat is that we are not including a significant fraction of clouds that are either far more distant or closer in than the characteristic blr distance .",
    "such clouds will not be line - emitting in the single bh system because the ionization parameter is either too high or too low .",
    "clouds much closer in will be tightly bound to their bh and will not contribute to the line emission in the binary system either . however ,",
    "if there are a large amount of cold clouds orbiting outside the blr in single bhs , these clouds are easier to become circumbinary and may be ionized by the combined continua from both bhs in the binary system , thus making the double - peaked feature less prominent .",
    "below we proceed with our fiducial model for the blr around single bhs , and the effects of such a distant cloud reservoir will be further discussed in sec [ subsec : disc1 ] .",
    "we combine the two bh plus clouds systems to form a binary on a circular orbit . in the frame corotating with the binary ,",
    "we derive the instantaneous locations and velocities of these clouds by orbital integrations of the restricted three - body problem .",
    "we are only interested in the temporal behaviors over a period that can be monitored on human life timescales , so we integrate the system for a few hundred years sampled with 1,000 evenly distributed temporal snapshots .",
    "long - term stability of the cloud orbits are not considered in this paper .",
    "we use a bulirsch - stoer integrator @xcite and the relative accuracy tracked by the jacobi constant was well below @xmath47 over the course of the integration .",
    "we then combine all the snapshots as a quasi steady - state configuration of clouds in the binary system , so as to improve the statistics of the cloud distributions .",
    "we found that the cloud distributions ( in real and velocity space ) in individual snapshots are similar ( but with much poorer statistics ) to those from the combined snapshots , after the initial @xmath48 of integration time , i.e. , the velocity distribution of blr clouds quickly establishes a quasi - equilibrium in much less than one binary orbit time .",
    "although clouds are still constantly expelled by the binary afterwards , the loss of clouds does not have significant effects on the velocity structure of the blr over the course of the integration .",
    "once we have the locations and velocities of the clouds , we determine line - emitting blr clouds under the assumption that clouds are illuminated by both bhs , and that the combined flux ( or ionization parameter ) required to ionize a blr cloud is roughly constant ( within @xmath42 , assuming a constant electron density ) .",
    "quantitatively , the locations of these line - emitting clouds satisfy the following constraint : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the distances to the two bhs .",

    "once the continuum of one of the bhs varies , it takes @xmath72 month for the associated blr emission to vary , and the orbital motion of the binary during this light travel time is negligible .",

    "[ fig : temp_vari_wide ] for several variability levels and two orbital phases , after the broad line has completed its reverberation ( @xmath73days ) . since the binary separation is large , the broad line is not double - peaked .",
    "but the line response introduces an asymmetry that correlates with the amplitude of the continuum variation .",
    "this asymmetry is more prominent at smaller orbital phase angles where the two velocity components overlap less in the spectrum .    in the case of intermediate separation binaries ,",
    "the two bhs are close enough such that part of the blrs are illuminated by both bhs .",
    "consider the example of two @xmath69 bhs with a separation @xmath74 pc , i.e. , about twice the size of a single blr . in this case , we use the configuration of blr clouds derived in our orbital integrations to compute the line profile changes due to continuum changes of one bh .",
    "the orbital time of the binary is @xmath75 yr , hence the orbital motion is negligible compared to the light travel time to the blr , which is a few months .",
    "however , due to the proximity of the two bhs , the continuum variation in one of the bhs also affects the other blr , although the effect is delayed and less prominent than those on its own blr .",

    "for comparison , the right panel shows the expected line responses to continuum variations for the same disk emitter model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1d8_d0d05 ] at various times , where the line response is complete at the last epoch . although the high - velocity wing responses more quickly than the central part of the line ( because the former emission originates closer to the bh ) , the two peaks change simultaneously .",
    "even though initially the broad line profiles are similar in the binary case and in the disk emitter case , their subsequent line responses are different : ii ) the disk emitter completes the response of the line much faster than the binary due to the proximity of the disk to the central bh ; ii ) both peaks are varying in proportion to each other in the disk emitter case , while in the binary case one peak has larger amplitude changes than the other ; and iii ) the two peaks reverberate simultaneously in the disk emitter case , whereas in the binary case one peak reverberates faster than the other .    in the case of close separation binaries where the two blrs are already merged , the behavior of line response to continuum variations of one of the bhs is similar to that of the intermediate separation binary , but the relative increase in the two peaks is less discrepant than in the intermediate separation binary .",

    "secular changes in the line profile due to the orbital motion of the binary , or velocity resolved reverberations of the blue and red wings of the line , can still be monitored even though the two peaks are blended with each other .",
    "our toy models confirm the feasibility of using spectral monitoring ( for radial velocity drifts ) and reverberation mapping ( for line responses ) to disentangle smbh binaries from disk emitters .",
    "these observations can also be achieved with less expensive narrow - band filters . however , there are some practical difficulties with these techniques .",
    "the spectral monitoring for radial velocity changes works best for binaries with @xmath84 . at larger binary separations , the two broad components will blend with each other in the spectrum , making it less likely to be flagged as a binary candidate , and the orbital period is too long to be detectable . at smaller separations ,",
    "the blrs are no longer distinct and the velocity structure becomes more complex with no coherent radial velocity drifts in the peak locations .",
    "thus , the spectral monitoring is suitable for identifying low mass smbh binaries ( @xmath85 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "reverberation mapping is a powerful tool for distinguishing a smbh binary from a disk emitter , but more complex blr geometries and kinematics ( such as those involving inflows or outflows ) will certainly complicate the situation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "although there are a few dedicated spectral monitoring programs for double - peaked broad line objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , there is currently no reverberation mapping program for a large sample of such objects . among the @xmath86 agns that are included in the reverberation mapping sample @xcite",
    ", there are several objects that clearly show double - peaked broad line features .",
    "in particular 3c 390.3 is a strong double - peak object with good reverberation mapping data @xcite . the time - ordered data of this source show that the blueshifted and redshifted components respond to the continuum variations almost simultaneously .",
    "thus , it is more likely that the double - peaked emission originates from a disk rather than from two corotating blrs in a binary system .",
    "the quasar sdss j1536 + 0441 was recently suspected to be a sub - pc binary smbh @xcite because of its double - peaked broad h@xmath1  line in the sdss spectrum .",
    "it has therefore received much attention ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the discovery of an additional redshifted component , most notably in h@xmath87(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , favored a disk emitter origin for the double peaks rather than a binary smbh .",
    "if we nevertheless assume this is a binary smbh and use constant eddington ratios @xmath11 for both bhs , and the fwhm values measured in @xcite , we get from equation ( [ eqn : fwhm ] ) @xmath88 and @xmath89 for the red and blue systems , respectively , similar to those reported in @xcite .",
    "we also derive blr sizes @xmath90 and @xmath91 . substituting the bh masses and @xmath92 in equation ( [ eqn : v_split ] )",
    "we get @xmath93 ^ 2\\ { \\rm pc}$ ] .",
    "however , in order to produce the comparable strength of both components and hence two distinct peaks , it requires that the smaller bh ( blue component ) is @xmath86 times more efficient at producing the broad - line emission than the larger bh .",
    "furthermore , by comparing the spectrum taken @xmath72 yr after @xcite with the original sdss spectrum , it appears that both the blueshifted and the redshifted components become slightly weaker whereas the central component ( which would be the classic blr in the disk emitter scenario ) remains almost unchanged .",
    "this strengthens the association of a disk emitter origin with the double - peaked feature .",
    "there have been a significant number of double - peaked or highly asymmetric broad line agns known in the literature , and large spectroscopic surveys such as sdss are providing many more ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an example , sdss j0012 - 1022 , is shown in fig.[fig : dp_examp ] , whose broad line profile can be well fitted by two components .",
    "note that the velocity splitting of this object is smaller than the fwhm of the redshifted component , and both broad components are reasonably well - fitted by a single gaussian .",
    "if it is of a binary origin , its separation must be large enough such that the two blrs are mostly distinct .",
    "even though its profile is not obviously double - peaked , it still stands out as a promising binary candidate",
    ". it would be interesting to perform spectral monitoring and reverberation mapping for a large statistical sample of such objects in order to determine their nature .",
    "there is currently some tension between theoretical expectations and observations on the frequency of smbh binaries : if major mergers of gas - rich galaxies is the triggering mechanism of quasar activity , then the expected binary fraction is very high ; on the other hand , the observed frequency of binary smbhs is less than a few percent beyond pc scales , and much lower on pc to sub - pc scales .",
    "we can parameterize the `` observable '' binary fraction at different stages as the product of several factors : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the intrinsic binary fraction ( @xmath96 in the merger hypothesis for quasar activity ) , @xmath97 is the probability of both bhs being active , @xmath98 is the observable fraction due to orientational effects ( inclination and orbital phase ) , @xmath99 is the observable fraction due to the specific technique used ( i.e. , spectroscopic methods or spatially resolved imaging ) which depends on the data quality of the observing program and folds in the complications associated with the emission line region geometry , @xmath100 is the time span during the specific stage of binary evolution , and @xmath101 is the lifetime of quasars .",
    "all these quantities except for @xmath101 are functions of the evolutionary stage of the binary .    in this paper , we have focused on the broad line diagnosis technique , which are for parsec to sub - parsec binaries before the binary enters the gravitational wave dominated regime .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath102 since in gas - rich mergers a nuclear gas disk on pc to 100 pc scales may form and feed both bhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the effects of random orientations and orbital phases it is reasonable to adopt @xmath103 , since nearly edge - on systems with radial motions are most likely to be detected .",
    "@xmath99 is difficult to quantify without a dedicated program and related monte - carlo simulations , but it is unlikely that @xmath99 is close to unity .",
    "bearing in mind the large uncertainties , the time span during this stage can be estimated as @xmath104 yr if gas drag is the dominant mechanism that shrinks the binary orbit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the quasar lifetime is not very well constrained and typical values are @xmath105 yr . taken together , the fraction of observable parsec to sub - parsec binaries based on broad line diagnosis is less than a few percent .",
    "this is still higher than the frequency of the known parsec to sub - parsec binary candidates , but lower than the frequency of known double - peaked broad line agns ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . of course",
    ", these are very crude estimates , and measuring the actual observed frequency will serve an important role of testing theoretical models of binary formation and evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
