    "moore s law observes that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years . quite apart from a comment about the remarkable evolution of electronics , moore s law highlights the cardinal role of the transistor in modern technology .",
    "what is it that distinguishes the transistor from other electronic elements ?",
    "the canonical transistor is a three - terminal device that derives its utility by enabling a small electric current or voltage to control a large current . in particular , transistors are active devices that provide electrical gain  gain that can be used to amplify a signal , sustain coherent oscillation , perform switching , provide storage , and implement logic .",
    "such are a few of the many functions that reflect the ubiquity of the transistor in modern electronics .",
    "transistor - like behavior has been studied in both cold and ultracold atomic systems revealing a variety of approaches for realizing an atomtronic transistor .",
    "the mechanisms responsible for transistor action explored thus far can be distinguished into three categories : ( 1 ) interatomic interactions of a single species in a single state , @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath1 controls @xmath2  @xcite ; ( 2 ) interatomic interactions of two species or states , @xmath0 and @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 controls @xmath2  @xcite ; and , ( 3 ) an external coupling field , @xmath5 , that drives internal state transitions of atom @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath6 controls @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the atomtronic transistor described in this work falls into the first category and follows from the analogy with electronic transistors , which operate based on the flow or buildup of a single carrier species , namely electrons .",
    "the first two categories , both of which derive functionality from interatomic interactions , are differentiated solely by experimental implementation . by introducing a second species or state , @xmath3 , to control the flow of @xmath0 ,",
    "the transistor system becomes more complex , requiring the superposition of two species- or state - dependent trapping potentials .",
    "by contrast , the third category utilizes a coupling , @xmath5 , other than atoms to control the flow of @xmath0 . in such systems",
    "the coupling strength of field @xmath5 is converted into the flow of atoms @xmath0 , a process akin to transduction . as in electronics ,",
    "the development of various types of transistors for specific applications emphasizes their utility .    driving an interest in atomtronics",
    "is the possibility of developing a paradigm for addressing problems in quantum signal and information processing that parallels the power of electronics in the classical realm .",
    "thus , an atomtronic version of transistor action should be a central theme of research in atomtronic devices and circuits .",
    "utilizing ultracold atoms in place of electrons , atomtronics lives in a challenging arena of physics involving many - body , interacting , and open quantum systems in non - thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is likely not possible to develop complete descriptions of any but the simplest atomtronic circuits .",
    "indeed , most experiments thus far involve fully quantum atomtronic circuits , i.e. , operating as a closed system that is described by unitary evolution  @xcite .",
    "transistor - like gain , on the other hand , requires an open system approach  @xcite .",
    "moreover , accepting the connection between information processing and entropy change suggests that dissipation and heat generation are fundamental aspects to be taken into account in atomtronic circuit design  @xcite . in classical circuits ,",
    "electrons are strongly coupled to the thermal environment of the medium in which they propagate .",
    "ultracold atomic systems , by contrast , are isolated from the surrounding environment such that dissipation and heat generation contribute to the state of the system . to make headway toward the understanding of atomtronic circuits one can either treat such dissipation as a perturbation to an otherwise quantum system , or introduce quantum effects to an otherwise classical system .",

    "it is precisely that this resistance can be negative that corresponds to the gain that transistors are known for  @xcite .",

    "we begin by describing the trapping potential that forms the three wells of the transistor .",
    "the q - point is shown to be controlled by the relative height of the barriers that separate the three wells , and a reverse - biased regime is revealed in which the chemical potential of the ensemble in the gate is larger than that of the source .",

    "the degree of overlap of the two barriers contributes to a potential bias in the gate , @xmath12 , with respect to the source and drain . finally , the drain well is modeled as a reflectionless output port that would feed into a subsequent circuit element .

    ", we presented a semiclassical model of a tailored triple - well system that utilizes the interplay of thermodynamic variables to exhibit transistor action .    within this approach , atom currents driven by chemical potentials and thermal energy are used to describe the particle and energy transport throughout the system . by varying the height of the barriers that separate the three wells , it was shown possible to control the steady - state chemical potential and temperature differences between the source and gate wells , an analogous process to biasing an electronic transistor to the desired quiescent point .",

    "the device exhibits regions of both negative and positive differential current gain , depending on the feedback parameter , that can exceed unity .",
    "the magnitude of the gain was shown to depend on the mean trap frequency of the gate well , a characteristic that arises due to the nonlinear dependence of the chemical potential and specific heat on the trap frequency .",

    "i.e. , those which exhibit negative transresistance behavior , can be coupled with frequency dependent loads to create an oscillatory output signal .",
