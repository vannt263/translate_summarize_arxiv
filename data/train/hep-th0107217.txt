    "d - branes allow us to study the structure of geometry at sub - stringy scales . from this perspective , space - time is a derived concept appearing as a vacuum moduli space of the d - brane worldvolume gauge theory . a number of works have been devoted to investigating geometry as seen by d - branes and comparing it with standard classical geometry or geometry probed by fundamental strings .    in @xcite ,",
    "it was pointed out that d - branes on orbifolds @xmath1 are described by quiver gauge theories , where a quiver is a diagram representing algebraic structure of the group @xmath2 .",
    "it implies that d - branes give a physical explanation of the mckay correspondence : a relation between geometry of resolutions of an orbifold @xmath3 and the representation theory of @xmath2 .",
    "( for mathematics on the mckay correspondence , see @xcite-@xcite . )",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study a relation between geometry of an orbifold @xmath3 probed by a d0-brane and the representation theory of @xmath2 based on the concept of stability of the d0-brane .",
    "stability has been recently brought to attention as it plays an important role in studying d - branes on calabi - yau manifolds  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the relevant notion of stability near the orbifold point in the k@xmath4hler moduli space is @xmath5-stability of representations of quivers  @xcite .",
    "it enables us to construct the vacuum moduli space of the quiver gauge theories without solving all equations defining the vacua and to study the marginal stability loci , where d - brane spectrum jumps .",
    "we would like to compare the results obtained from stability of quiver representations corresponding to a d0-brane with geometric structure of three - dimensional orbifolds @xmath6 with @xmath2 an abelian subgroup of @xmath7 .",
    "the latter is investigated following the procedure given in @xcite . in this formulation ,",
    "the vacuum moduli space is obtained by solving both f - flatness and d - flatness conditions , the equations defining the vacua , with the aid of toric geometry .",
    "the d - flatness conditions contain fayet - iliopoulos terms originating from twisted sectors of closed strings , which parameterize the k@xmath4hler moduli space of the orbifold .",
    "the core of the method in @xcite is to convert f - flatness conditions into d - flatness conditions of an auxiliary gauge theory with a large number of chiral multiplets .",
    "scalar components of the chiral multiplets become homogeneous coordinates describing the vacuum moduli space . after reducing redundant coordinates by using d - flatness conditions and gauge symmetry ,",
    "we obtain the vacuum moduli space of the quiver gauge theory .",
    "various models were investigated following this procedure  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most striking feature common to these analyses is that non - geometric phases are projected out .",
    "this is in contrast to the analyses based on fundamental strings  @xcite , in which non - geometric phases are realized as abstract conformal field theories . by inspecting the process of the calculation of the d - brane moduli spaces",
    ", we can see that the key to the disappearance of non - geometric phases is the redundancy of coordinates mentioned above .",
    "so far , however , physical origin of the redundancy has not been clarified ; it just arises as a result of a combinatorial algorithm converting f - flatness conditions to d - flatness conditions . to understand this point is one motivation of this work .",
    "the orbifold we study in this paper is @xmath0 .",
    "a reason to study this orbifold is that it has a rather rich structure in spite of its simplicity ; it contains multiple phases that are related by topology changing processes called flops  @xcite as we review in section 2 .",
    "we also see that non - geometric phases disappear due to the redundancy of homogeneous coordinates . in section 3",
    "we re - examine the moduli space of d0-branes based on @xmath5-stability of quiver representations . by comparing the results with those obtained in section 2 ,",
    "we obtain a correspondence between homology cycles of a resolution of the orbifold and quiver representations .",
    "furthermore , we find that the redundancy of the homogeneous coordinates stems from monodromy around the orbifold point in the k@xmath4hler moduli space . finally , we discuss the disappearance of non - geometric phases from the viewpoint of stability of d0-branes .",
    "in this section , we first review the method given in @xcite to study d0-branes on orbifolds @xmath6 with @xmath9 .",
    "second , we present the geometric structure of the orbifold @xmath8 obtained by this method  @xcite .",
    "d - branes on orbifolds @xmath6 are described by quiver gauge theories .",
    "a quiver is a graph consisting of a set of nodes @xmath10 and a set of arrows @xmath11 starting from the node @xmath12 and ending at the node @xmath13 .",
    "we will denote the number of the nodes as @xmath14 .",
    "given a quiver , one obtains a gauge theory by considering a representation of the quiver .",
    "a representation @xmath15 of a quiver is a collection of finite dimensional vector spaces @xmath16 , one for each node @xmath10 , and a collection of linear maps @xmath17 , one for each arrow @xmath11 .",
    "the vector @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the dimension of the vector space @xmath16 , is referred to as the dimension vector of the representation @xmath15 .",
    "the gauge theory corresponding to a representation @xmath15 is an @xmath20 supersymmetric gauge theory with a gauge symmetry @xmath21 : a node @xmath12 represents a factor of @xmath22 in the gauge group @xmath23 , and an arrow @xmath24 represents a chiral multiplet transforming as @xmath25 under @xmath26 .",
    "note that the factor @xmath27 in the gauge group is the diagonal subgroup of @xmath28 which acts trivially .    a quiver relevant to the discussion of d - branes on @xmath6 is the mckay quiver associated to @xmath2 .",
    "nodes in the mckay quiver correspond to irreducible representations of @xmath2 , and arrows encode information on tensor products of a three - dimensional representation defining the action of @xmath2 on @xmath29 and irreducible representations of @xmath2 . in this paper , we restrict @xmath2 to be an abelian subgroup of @xmath7 , whose irreducible representations are one - dimensional . in that case , the number @xmath14 of nodes in the mckay quiver coincides with the order of @xmath2 .",
    "thus a d0-brane on an orbifold @xmath6 , which we would like to discuss , corresponds to a quiver representations with a dimension vector @xmath30 .",
    "we are concerned with the vacuum moduli space @xmath31 of the quiver gauge theory .",
    "the vacua are parameterized by values for scalars in the chiral multiplets , modulo gauge equivalence , solving f - flatness and d - flatness conditions . in @xcite",
    ", it was found to be convenient to consider f - flatness conditions as if they were d - flatness conditions in an auxiliary gauge theory .",
    "the vacuum moduli space of this auxiliary gauge theory is a @xmath32-dimensional space of the following form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of scalars in the chiral multiplets of the auxiliary gauge theory .",
    "the data necessary to construct this space are obtained through a combinatorial algorithm based on toric geometry .",
    "this process is burdensome in general , and hence an analytic expression of @xmath34 is not known for @xmath35 nor @xmath36 .    to obtain the vacuum moduli space @xmath37 of the quiver gauge theory , one must further impose d - flatness conditions @xmath38 that exist in the quiver gauge theory from the beginning .",
    "note that although the index @xmath39 takes values from 0 to @xmath40 , the number of independent conditions is @xmath40 .",
    "real parameters @xmath41 come from twisted sectors of ns - ns fields , and they are related to physical fayet - iliopoulos parameters @xmath42 through the following relation : @xmath43 this relation comes from the requirement of quasi - supersymmetry of the vacuum  @xcite . in the case of @xmath44 , @xmath41",
    "coincide with the physical fayet - iliopoulos parameters @xmath42 .",
    "the total number of d - flatness conditions to be imposed on the auxiliary gauge theory is @xmath45 , and gauge symmetry is @xmath46 .",
    "thus the moduli space @xmath31 takes the form @xmath47 note that the @xmath40 d - flatness conditions in equation ( @xmath48 ) have fayet - iliopoulos parameters @xmath41 , while @xmath49 d - flatness conditions coming from f - flatness conditions do not have such parameters .",
    "now we investigate the case @xmath50 in detail  @xcite .",
    "non - trivial elements @xmath51 @xmath52 of @xmath53 act on the coordinates @xmath54 of @xmath29 as follows : @xmath55 here @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath57 is an abelian group of order four , there are four irreducible representations with dimension one .",
    "the quiver diagram is depicted in figure [ fig : quiver ] .",
    "( 120,120 ) ( 54,110)@xmath58 ( 0,56)@xmath59 ( 54,5)@xmath60 ( 105,56)@xmath61 ( 20,56)(1,0)80 ( 100,64)(-1,0)80 ( 64,20)(0,1)80 ( 56,100)(0,-1)80 ( 10,46)(1,-1)36 ( 110,74)(-1,1)36 ( 74,10)(1,1)36 ( 46,110)(-1,-1)36 ( 15,69)(1,1)36 ( 105,51)(-1,-1)36 ( 51,15)(-1,1)36 ( 69,105)(1,-1)36    since the quiver has four nodes ( @xmath62 ) , the associated quiver gauge theory has a gauge symmetry @xmath63 and three fayet - iliopoulos parameters @xmath41 .",
    "the vacuum moduli space of the quiver gauge theory is computed following the procedure stated above . in this case , the combinatorial algorithm gives an auxiliary gauge theory with @xmath64 .",
    "therefore the vacuum moduli space @xmath37 is represented as , @xmath65 where six d - flatness conditions are @xmath66 here we have used parameters @xmath67 .",
    "we first study the geometric structure of @xmath31 in the region @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 . for @xmath68 ,",
    "@xmath71 is nonzero due to the equation ( [ eq : d - flat1 ] ) . combining with a u(1 ) gauge symmetry corresponding to this d - flatness condition",
    ", we can eliminate @xmath71 .",
    "similarly , in the region @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , we can eliminate @xmath72 ( respectively @xmath73 ) .",
    "thus in the region @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the six d - flatness conditions are reduced to the last three equations ( [ eq : d - flat4 ] ) , ( [ eq : d - flat5 ] ) , ( [ eq : d - flat6 ] ) .",
    "they describe a resolution of @xmath50 .",
    "however , the topology of the resolution is not fixed uniquely since the inequalities @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 do not fix the sign of the right - hand side of ( [ eq : d - flat4 ] ) , ( [ eq : d - flat5 ] ) , ( [ eq : d - flat6 ] ) ; flop transition occurs as the sign of the right - hand side changes .",
    "for example ,",
    "in the region @xmath74 , the resolved orbifold has a topology represented by the toric diagram drawn in figure [ fig : toric](a ) .",
    "each line in the diagram represents homology 2-cycle @xmath75 in the resolution of @xmath0 , whose volume is parameterized by @xmath41 . if we change the sign of @xmath76 , @xmath77 is replaced by @xmath78 as depicted in figure [ fig : toric](b ) .",
    "the volume of @xmath78 is parameterized by @xmath79 , which implies that the homology class @xmath80 $ ] is equal to @xmath81 $ ] as noted in @xcite .    before we come to the analysis outside of @xmath82 , we comment on the phase structure obtained from just the three d - flatness conditions ( [ eq : d - flat4 ] ) , ( [ eq : d - flat5 ] ) , ( [ eq : d - flat6 ] ) .",
    "these are the d - flatness conditions that appear in the analysis of the orbifold @xmath0 based on fundamental strings  @xcite . in the region @xmath83 ,",
    "one obtains the same resolutions of the orbifold as described above . in another region , however , one obtains a singular space .",
    "such regions are called non - geometric phases realized as abstract conformal field theories .",
    "now we come back to the analysis of the six d - flatness conditions from ( [ eq : d - flat1 ] ) to ( [ eq : d - flat6 ] ) .",
    "if we consider the region @xmath84 instead of @xmath69 , we can eliminate @xmath85 instead of @xmath72 by using the d - flatness condition ( [ eq : d - flat2 ] ) . in this case",
    ", we obtain the following three d - flatness conditions .",
    "@xmath86 one can see that the equations ( [ eq : d - flat7 ] ) , ( [ eq : d - flat8 ] ) , ( [ eq : d - flat9 ] ) have the same structure as the equations ( [ eq : d - flat4 ] ) , ( [ eq : d - flat5 ] ) , ( [ eq : d - flat6 ] ) if we take into account that we are considering the region @xmath84 instead of @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , phase structure in this region is the same as that in the region @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in this way",
    ", we obtain phase structure near the orbifold point in the k@xmath4hler moduli space as shown in figure [ fig : phase ] . with eight ( @xmath87 ) ways of eliminating the coordinates mentioned above , there are 32 phases in all .",
    "the most striking feature of the result is that non - geometric phases do not appear in contrast to the analyses based on fundamental strings .",
    "we can see that what makes non - geometric phases disappear is the redundancy of the homogeneous coordinates @xmath88 . at each point in the k@xmath4hler moduli space , we need only six coordinates out of nine to describe @xmath31 , but which coordinates we should choose depends on the region in the k@xmath4hler moduli space as stated above .",
    "thus it is important to clarify the physical origin of the redundancy of the coordinates to understand the reason that d - branes avoid non - geometric phases .",
    "in section 2 , we have studied the vacuum moduli space of the worldvolume gauge theory of a d0-brane on the orbifold @xmath8 based on the method using toric geometry . in this section",
    ", we re - examine the same space by using @xmath5-stability of quiver representations .",
    "the reformulation arises as follows .",
    "first , consider the space of solutions of f - flatness conditions . since it is invariant under the action of the complexified gauge group @xmath89",
    ", one can talk about the @xmath89-orbits satisfying the f - flatness conditions .",
    "the key point is that , under certain conditions , the @xmath89-orbit satisfying the f - flatness conditions contains a solution of d - flatness conditions .",
    "they are @xmath5-stability conditions of quiver representations  @xcite .    to study @xmath5-stability of a quiver representation we need to know its subrepresentations .",
    "a representation @xmath90 is a subrepresentation of @xmath15 if there is an injective homomorphism from @xmath90 to @xmath15 . here",
    "a homomorphism between two representations @xmath91 and @xmath92 is a collection of linear maps @xmath93 which satisfy @xmath94 as matrices .",
    "a quiver representation with a dimension vector @xmath95 is @xmath5-semistable if it satisfies @xmath96 and every subrepresentation with a dimension vector @xmath97 satisfies @xmath98 furthermore , a representation is @xmath5-stable if every non - trivial subrepresentations satisfies @xmath99 .",
    "note that the equation ( [ eq : stability1 ] ) follows by taking traces of the d - flatness conditions ( [ eq : d - flatness ] ) , so the parameters @xmath41 in the expression coincide with the parameters appearing in the d - flatness conditions .    to find out @xmath5-stable representations , it is useful to consider schur representations .",
    "a representation @xmath15 is schur if it satisfies end@xmath100 .",
    "this condition implies that schur representations correspond to d - brane bound states  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath5-stable representations are schur , we obtain @xmath5-stable representations by considering schur representations which satisfy f - flatness conditions , and then imposing @xmath5-stability conditions on the schur representations .    in the case of @xmath0 , endomorphism of a representation with a dimension vector @xmath101",
    "consists of four linear maps @xmath102 .",
    "the condition for the representation to be schur is that the equations @xmath103 for @xmath104 have a unique solution @xmath105 .",
    "it requires that all the nodes in the quiver diagram must be connected by arrows corresponding to non - vanishing @xmath106 s . under this condition , we fix three @xmath106 s to be zero by using the complexified gauge symmetry @xmath107 .",
    "since we also impose f - flatness conditions @xmath108 with @xmath109 , more than three @xmath106 s vanish in general .",
    "the least number of non - vanishing @xmath106 s is three , which corresponds to the dimension of the orbifold . to be consistent with the f - flatness conditions , any neighboring two arrows out of the three are in opposite directions . by examining the conditions in detail",
    ", we found that there are 32 schur representations with three non - vanishing @xmath106 s .",
    "we will illustrate these representations by eliminating arrows corresponding to vanishing @xmath106 s from the quiver diagram .",
    "the 32 schur representations are classified into three types according to their forms as graphs .",

    "for example , @xmath162 corresponds to the action @xmath163 , and leads to the following permutation of subrepresentations , @xmath164    based on the correspondence between representations and homology classes obtained above , the action @xmath162 is geometrically interpreted as @xmath165 \\leftrightarrow [ p]-[c_1]-[c_2]-[c_3 ] , \\quad   [ c_2 ] \\leftrightarrow [ c_3].\\ ] ] similarly , the actions @xmath166 and @xmath167 are represented in terms of geometry .",
    "it is known that the actions @xmath168 satisfying the relations , @xmath169 , are interpreted as monodromies around the orbifold point in the k@xmath4hler moduli space  @xcite .",
    "thus the change of homogeneous coordinates in the toric method stems from the orbifold monodromy , and the number @xmath34 of the coordinates in the expression ( [ eq : moduli ] ) can be understood from this viewpoint . as discussed in section 2",
    ", the fact that d - branes do not see non - geometric phases comes from the redundancy of the homogeneous coordinates .",
    "thus the above argument shows that this property is a consequence of the monodromy around the orbifold point .",
    "for a few examples other than @xmath0 , we have verified that the redundancy of homogeneous coordinates in the expression ( [ eq : moduli ] ) can be understood from orbifold monodromy .",
    "it would be interesting to have a general expression for the number @xmath34 of homogeneous coordinates in the expression ( [ eq : moduli ] ) for orbifolds @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "finally we would like to discuss decay products at marginal stability loci .",
    "they are read off from the cuboctahedron as follows .",
    "subrepresentations on its surfaces visible from a point in the @xmath130-space are interpreted as potential decay products .",
    "as one of the surfaces shrinks to a line , decay is triggered by the subrepresentation on this surface since the stability condition ( [ eq : stability2 ] ) for this subrepresentation saturates .",
    "remaining elements of the decay must be such that the sum of dimension vectors of decay products is @xmath101 . by inspecting the rule of assignment of subrepresentations on the cuboctahedron",
    ", one can see that decay products are two subrepresentations on the shrinking surfaces at the marginal stability loci .",
    "for example , on the locus @xmath144 , @xmath101 decays into @xmath143 and @xmath145 as shown in figure @xmath170(b ) .",
    "this result agrees with the conjecture on decay products given in @xcite . to explain the conjecture , we need to make some definitions . a sequence of subrepresentations of a semi - stable representation @xmath15 , @xmath171",
    "is called a jordan - h@xmath172lder filtration if the dimension vectors @xmath173 of @xmath174 satisfy @xmath175 and the quotients @xmath176 are @xmath5-stable . by using a jordan - h@xmath172lder filtration , the graded representation of @xmath15",
    "is defined as @xmath177 given a semi - stable representation @xmath15 , there may be several jordan - h@xmath172lder filtrations but @xmath178 is unique .",
    "we also note that @xmath178 coincides with @xmath15 for @xmath5-stable representations .",
    "the conjecture given in @xcite is that decay products of @xmath15 on marginal stability loci are given by @xmath178 . in the present case ,",
    "on the locus @xmath144 , the representation @xmath179 has a jordan - h@xmath172lder filtration , @xmath180 it leads @xmath181 .",
    "thus d0-brane decays into a threshold bound state of @xmath143 and @xmath145 at @xmath144 , in agreement with the result read off from the cuboctahedron .",
    "in this section , we would like to discuss why non - geometric phases are projected out from the viewpoint of stability of d0-branes .",
    "in standard classical geometry , elementary constituents of a space are points ; correspondingly , a space probed by a point particle is described by classical geometry . in this paper , we have used a d0-brane as a probe to study the orbifold . since",
    "a d0-brane is a point - like object , it may seem reasonable that a space probed by a d0-brane has a classical geometric interpretation .",
    "however , there is an issue we have to care about : stability of a d0-brane .",
    "if a d0-brane becomes unstable , it decays into a sum of higher dimensional objects in general , and loses the property as a point - like probe .",
    "thus the most likely expectation is that a space probed by a d0-brane is described by classical geometry only if the d0-brane is stable .",
    "this expectation is consistent with the result in this paper .",
    "as we have seen , any point in the @xmath130-space where a d0-brane is stable belongs to geometric phases , and the loci on which d0-brane is marginally stable coincide with boundaries of geometric phases . in this respect ,",
    "the fact that d0-branes are always ( semi ) stable may be understood as one explanation of the disappearance of non - geometric phases .                                          c.  beasley , b.  r.  greene , c.  i.  lazaroiu and m.  r.  plesser , `` d3-branes on partial resolutions of abelian quotient singularities of calabi - yau threefolds , '' nucl .",
