    "the method of two - particle correlations at low relative momenta ( commonly referred to as _ femtoscopy _ ) allows to extract space - time characteristics of the particle emitting source , created in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite ,  @xcite .",

    "the main goal of kaon and proton femtoscopic study is to complement information about the source size deduced from pion correlations .",
    "the analysis provides an extension of the transverse momentum range .",
    "therefore , it is possible to verify whether the `` homogeneity lengths '' mechanism  @xcite is valid for mesons as well as baryons .",
    "furthermore , one can test the transverse mass scaling of the source size which is interpreted as a signature of collective behaviour  @xcite .",
    "baryon - antibaryon correlations might be also used to study final state interactions ( fsi ) which can influence particle yields . it is observed that thermal models are not able to reproduce the p/@xmath7 ratio simultaneously with other hadron production ratios  @xcite ,  @xcite . it is argued that rescattering in the hadronic phase should be taken into account while determining particle yields  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "if the assumption is valid , it ought to be reflected as anticorrelation in baryon - antibaryon correlation functions , due to the annihilation channel .",

    "the decay channel @xmath13 was used for identification of neutral kaons .",
    "more details about @xmath0 analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "particles from the same event were paired to form the signal distribution of relative momenta @xmath14 , from two different events to form a mixed background distribution .",
    "pair cuts based on the ratio of clusters ( groups of detector signals ) shared by two tracks to all clusters of both tracks and the angular distance inside tpc between two tracks were used to account for fake low - q pairs ( splitting ) and two - track inefficiency ( merging ) .",
    "after pair selection , the resulting signal distribution was divided by the background distribution to form the correlation function .",
    "@xmath0 correlations were fitted with a parametrization which includes bose - einstein statistics as well as strong fsi  @xcite .",

    "the height of this peak is related to the femtoscopic radius .    due to the fact that feed - down from weak decays can not be neglected in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , the residual correlations from p@xmath11 system in pp correlations have to be taken into account .",
    "since @xmath11 decays into p and @xmath24 with small decay momentum with respect to the mass of p , femtoscopic correlations between a primary p and a @xmath11 might still be detected for a pair consisting of the primary p and the p from @xmath11 decay .",
