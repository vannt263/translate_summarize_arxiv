    "the modern paradigm of cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ( @xmath6cdm ) predicts that galaxies form hierarchically  growing through the gradual merging of many smaller galaxies .",
    "a giant spiral like our milky way is expected to undergo a succession of dwarf galaxy accretion events which have different observational signatures , depending on their occurrence in the past , present , or future .",
    "ancient accretion events can be detected through careful sifting of the chemo - dynamical phase - space of halo stars .",
    "ongoing accretion is implied by the presence of satellite galaxies within the halo , and imminent accretion is marked by the existence of field dwarfs near to their future hosts .",
    "0.3 cm     all of these manifestations of accretion are the focus of intense inventory and scrutiny , in order to compare observations to theory .",
    "in particular , there is a long - running concern about the relative scarcity of milky way satellites , more recently expressed as a `` too big to fail '' problem ( see summary in @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a recent controversy about the coherence of observed satellite systems compared to expectations of more random infall ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these tensions between observation and theory have led to doubts about the standard model  with solutions ranging from baryonic feedback to mild revisions of the dark matter theory to radical dismissal of the entire cosmological framework ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this context ,",
    "intense observational efforts continue to focus on inventories and analyses of satellites and streams around the local group ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "more challenging but essential to a full picture is the extension to studying a broader sample of galaxies at larger distances .",
    "success has been obtained through low - surface brightness imaging and resolved stellar maps ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the work is far from complete .",
    "one valuable , alternative route to finding faint satellites and streams around nearby galaxies is through using small aperture ( 1050 cm ) telescopes in combination with the latest generation of commercial ccd cameras ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". the short focal ratios of these telescopes , along with the use of single , photographic - film size ccds , allow them to probe large areas of galaxy haloes while reaching surface brightness levels @xmath223 magnitudes deeper ( @xmath7 28 mag arcsec@xmath8 ) than the classic photographic plate surveys ( e.g. palomar observatory sky survey ) and the available large - scale digital surveys ( e.g. sdss ) .",
    "here we use this amateur telescope discovery approach to report a faint , elongated galaxy projected onto the halo regions of ngc 253 in the sculptor group . with a distance of 3.5  mpc ,",
    "ngc  253 is one of the nearest large spirals , and has been well studied ( e.g. @xcite ) , but this object , which we call ngc  253-dw2 , had been missed .",
    "we first noticed a candidate satellite galaxy in a visual inspection of several images of ngc  253 available on the internet that were taken by amateur astronomers : alessandro maggi using a takahashi epsilon 180ed astrograph ( 18-cm diameter at @xmath9 ) and mike sidonio using a 12-in @xmath10 newtonian ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bigimg ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "the pixel scale was coarse and it was not clear if the elongated feature was real or an artifact or reflection as often present in amateur images .",
    "we investigated the nature of ngc  253-dw2 by follow - up observations using amateur and professional facilities as follows .",
    "first , deep imaging of the field centered on the dwarf candidate was collected remotely with the chilean advanced robotic telescope ( chart32 ) , an 80-cm @xmath11 corrected cassegrain telescope located at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory , chile .",
    "an fli pl-16803 ccd camera was used , with a pixel scale of @xmath12 over a @xmath13 field of view .",
    "two overlapping sets of 20@xmath141200  s individual image frames were obtained through a baader luminance filter over several photometric nights between september and november 2013 .",
    "each individual exposure was reduced following standard image processing procedures for dark subtraction , bias correction , and flat fielding @xcite .",
    "the images were combined to create a final co - added image with a total exposure time of 48,000  s.    part of the resulting chart32 image is shown as an inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : bigimg ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the candidate object looks fairly regular and diffuse , like a nearby dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy rather than a background galaxy or an instrumental artifact .",
    "it is also very elongated , and could in principle be a clump of foreground galactic cirrus , although there are no such indications from the _ planck _ 857  ghz data .",
    "to investigate further , we used the suprime - cam imager on the 8 m subaru telescope @xcite , with 5@xmath14114s of @xmath0-band imaging on 2014 dec 18 , and 5@xmath14120s of johnson ",
    "cousins @xmath1-band on 19 dec 2014 ( filters dictated by observing schedule constraints ) .",
    "the seeing was @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the data were reduced using a modified version of the ` sdfred-2 ` pipeline .",
    "preprocessing of the suprime - cam data was done by debiasing , trimming , flat fielding , and gain correcting each individual exposure chip - by - chip using median stacks of nightly sky flats .",
    "scattered light produced by bright stars both in and out of the field of view required removing this smoothly varying component before performing photometry and solving for a world coordinate system solution . to remove scattered light , we fitted the smoothly varying component by creating a flat for every chip within each frame using a running median with a 300 pixel box - size .",
    "this was then subtracted from the original , unsmoothed frame to produce a final image for photometric processing    fig .",
    "[ fig : bigimg ] ( right panel ) shows a portion of the suprime - cam image around ngc  253-dw2 .",
    "again , the object appears elongated , but now is visibly resolved into stars  with an appearance similar to another suprime - cam image of a disrupted dsph at @xmath24mpc @xcite .",
    "the suprime - cam instrumental magnitudes were derived using the daophot ii and allstar @xcite packages .",
    "sources were detected in the @xmath0-band by requiring a 3-@xmath17 excess above the local background , with the list of the @xmath0-band detections being subsequently used for the allstar run on the @xmath1-band image . to obtain clean colour  magnitude diagrams and to minimize contamination from faint background galaxies , sources with the ratio estimator of the pixel - to - pixel scatter @xmath18 2.0 and sharpness parameters @xmath19 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were kept for further analysis . to calibrate the photometry , we cross - identified sources from subaru with pan - starrs1 sources for which the photometric uncertainties are lower than 0.05 @xcite .",
    "there is no strong evidence of a significant colour term between the subaru and pan - starrs1 filters ( @xmath0 vs.  @xmath0 , @xmath1 vs. @xmath20 ) , so we used the median magnitude offset to calibrate the subaru data onto the pan - starrs1 photometric system .",
    "we now consider some properties of ngc  253-dw2 using the suprime - cam resolved stellar photometry .",
    "stars are selected from an elliptical region of @xmath21 around this galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resolved ] , _ left panel _ ) and plotted on an extinction - corrected colour  magnitude diagram ( _ right _ ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show a control field with an equal area but @xmath22 away from the dwarf .",
    "relative to the control field , the dwarf field has an overdensity of stars at roughly @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "this is just the signature expected for the upper regions of the red giant branch ( rgb ) at a distance of @xmath23.5mpc  based both on other observations of ngc  253 @xcite and on theoretical isochrones ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolved ] ) .",
    "the presence of the rgb stars implies an age of more than 1  gyr , and the isochrone comparisons suggest a metallicity of [ @xmath25/h ] @xmath26 .",
    "there are no obvious signs of blue main - sequence or of core - helium burning `` blue loop '' stars , which would trace star formation over the past 600myr .",
    "the dwarf thus appears similar to the old , metal - poor halo population of ngc  253 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , although the shallowness of the imaging makes it difficult to definitively rule out the presence of some young stars , or of asymptotic giant branch stars from an intermediate - age population , as found in another satellite of ngc  253 , scl - mm - dw1 @xcite .",
    "therefore the possibility remains that it is a dsph ",
    "dirr transition type .",
    "the structural parameters of the dwarf galaxy are determined through modeling the spatial distribution of its stars , assumed to follow an exponential density profile .",
    "we use the algorithm developed in @xcite and updated with a full markov chain monte carlo treatment .",
    "the posterior probability density function ( pdf ) is produced for six model parameters ( plus a constant background level ) : the spatial centroid of the dwarf , its semi - major axis half - light radius @xmath27 , its ellipticity @xmath28 , the major axis position angle @xmath29 , and the number of stars @xmath30 in the galaxy ( down to a magnitude of @xmath31 ; the shallower @xmath0-band imaging is not used ) .",
    ".properties of ngc  253-dw2 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the resulting marginalized pdfs are in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] ( _ left _ ) for the three main parameters of interest ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath27 ) and summarised in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "the new dwarf galaxy is very elongated : @xmath320.7 .",
    "its implied physical size is @xmath33kpc or @xmath34kpc circularized ( geometric mean of major and minor axes ; including a small uncertainty on the distance modulus , @xmath35 , from an adopted thickness of @xmath2150kpc for the ngc  253 satellite distribution ) .",
    "its total luminosity is estimated as follows .",
    "we begin populating an artificial stellar luminosity function , based on parsec isochrones , until @xmath30 stars fall above the observational threshhold of @xmath31 .",
    "we then sum up the flux of all stars , above and below the threshhold , and find a total @xmath36-band luminosity of @xmath37 , which is equivalent to @xmath38 and implies a central surface brightness @xmath39 .",
    "we now place ngc  253-dw2 in a plot of luminosity and size from a compilation of hot stellar systems ( @xcite , with updates ) . as fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] ( _ right _ ) shows , this object is about twice as large as an average dsph of the same luminosity , although there are a few objects with comparable properties  most notably and  xix .",
    "the elongated shape is also unusual for a dsph @xcite , and the only known examples in the milky way with @xmath40 are all thought to be tidally disrupting ( sgr , her , uma  i , uma  ii ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "tides are predicted to cause elongation  both from unbound stars soon after a pericentric passage @xcite , and during the final stage before complete disruption @xcite .",
    "we make a rough initial estimate of the tidal radius of ngc  253-dw2 , assuming a @xmath36-band stellar mass - to - light ratio of @xmath21.5 , and the dark matter largely stripped . at a galactocentric distance of 50kpc",
    ", we adopt a host galaxy circular velocity of 180kms@xmath41 ( extrapolating from @xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite , we predict a `` limiting '' radius of @xmath21kpc , which in combination with the observations suggests the dwarf is filling or overfilling its roche lobe .",
    "five examples of clearly disrupting dwarfs are also marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] ( _ right _ ) , and appear as similar outliers from the mean relation .",
    "we conclude , based on the ellipticity and size of ngc  253-dw2 , that it is experiencing tidal disruption . in this scenario ,",
    "the ellipticity of the dwarf may imply that @xmath42 of its stellar mass has been lost @xcite , and thus that its pre - disruption luminosity was @xmath43 ( equivalent to the fornax dsph ) .",
    "if spread over a broad region , this large quantity of extra - tidal stars could well have been missed by our imaging .",
    "although such a luminous progenitor might be in tension with our low metallicity inference ( e.g. @xcite ) , we note that photometric errors make this inference very provisional .",
    "the discovery of ngc  253-dw2 , and the potential for follow - up observations , provides an opportunity to study the dynamics of a disrupting dsph , to test its dark matter distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) and to compare its infall direction to the large - scale shear field @xcite .",
    "it may also have implications for the effect of the satellite on the host . even though this dwarf has a relatively low stellar mass",
    ", @xmath6cdm models predict a pre - infall virial mass of @xmath2(14)@xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the stellar mass of ngc  253 ( @xmath45 ; @xcite ) , and even if 95% of the dark matter was lost before making a close passage to the host , it could still have had a noticeable impact .",
    "intriguingly , ngc  253 has several peculiar features ( central starburst , kinematic twisting , stellar halo `` shelf ''  also visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : bigimg ] ) previously suggested as signatures of recent , unidentified interactions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the culprit has now been found , and that more cases of dwarf - galaxy `` stealth attacks '' could be identified through deep , wide - field studies of galaxy haloes .",
