    "in the 21@xmath3 century we see the advent of true quantum technologies such as quantum computing @xcite and quantum metrology @xcite which are expected to outperform any conventional approach .",
    "these fields are rapidly evolving and have created the demand for strategies to govern individual quantum systems .",
    "thus , the theory of control of quantum systems has gained tremendous interest recently and is already a huge field .",
    "parallel to the theoretical advances , the experimental side has also seen a blast , especially due to the swift progress in intense and ultrashort laser pulse generation @xcite which opens up the prospect to observe and manipulate properties of single molecules , solid - state systems or atomic - scale phenomena in real - time .",
    "there have been numerous paradigms developed for different tasks and control objectives .",
    "one of the early ones is open - loop control which relies on the knowledge of the initial quantum system and a well - defined control objective to design control fields without considering feedback from measurements .",
    "this can be done coherently , i.e. we use these control fields in a way that does not destroy quantum coherence which was utilized for problems e.g. in quantum chemistry . in coherent control in general",
    ", the control operations consist of unitary transformations . however , some quantum systems may not be controllable using only coherent controls . for such uncontrollable quantum systems , it may be possible to enhance the capabilities of quantum control by introducing new control strategies where one is allowed to destroy coherence of the quantum systems during the control process ( incoherent control ) .",
    "optimal control techniques such as gradient - free convex optimization can also boost the convergence properties and efficiency of open - loop control designs .",
    "although open - loop strategies have achieved theoretically and practically significant success , they are quite limited in scope .",
    "it was natural to extend the studies to closed - loop control which has been investigated in depth in classical control theory and shown to be superior in many ways , most notably in reliability and robustness .",
    "these are essential in quantum control because any practical quantum technology - a quantum computer , for instance - has to be robust in the presence of noise or uncertainty . in closed - loop control ,",
    "the state information is used in shaping the control mechanism .",
    "we may split this paradigm into two categories ( although other categorizations also exist ) : adaptive learning control and quantum feedback control ( qfc ) . in the former case we have",
    "a closed - loop operation and each cycle is applied on a new sample .",
    "this procedure has gained great success where multiple samples are available , e.g. controlling molecules in an ensemble with lasers @xcite .",
    "the other concept , quantum feedback control ( qfc ) includes direct or indirect measurements on the state to gain information which can be fed back to achieve the desired performance .",
    "classical feedback control is well - understood and has tremendous advantages because - in principle - the measurement back - action can be neglected classically , i.e. we can acquire full information without disturbing the system . due to the intrinsically different nature of quantum mechanics , most importantly the well - known phenomena of quantum state collapse and the unnegligable measurement back - action , qfc faces a great number of challenges .",
    "nevertheless , much has been done since the first recognition ( see e.g. @xcite ) of the importance of this paradigm and promising results have been obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formalism ] .",
    ", we overview the most important elements of the general framework needed to formulate problems in quantum feedback control such as the markovian master equation , weak and continuous measurements , stochastic schrdinger and master equations @xcite .",
    "this can be useful for people who are not familiar with the formalism of this field and also helps the survey to be self - consistent , self - contained and to avoid ambiguities in notation . in section [ sec : gendesc ] .",
    ", we give a general description of qfc and in section [ sec : cohmodell ] .",
    ", we set up a coherent control model @xcite and outline some theorems regarding its capability @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in a generalization of this setup , it is convenient to compare the results with open - loop control @xcite . in section [ sec : quantumchaos ] .",
    ", we briefly introduce how quantum feedback can help us to understand quantum chaos better which has found to be essential in understanding the transition from quantum to classical @xcite . in the following section we review some of the tasks which are proven to be efficiently achievable such as quantum error correction , rapid state preparation and purification , entanglement generation .",
    "we start with a simple example : feedback control of a single qubit in a discrete - time setting @xcite .",
    "this clearly illustrates the central concepts .",
    "then we move on to a similar task but with a continuous measurements @xcite ; at the end of this section , we also make some remarks on recently emerged questions ( arbitrary large systems @xcite , feedback delay problem @xcite ) .",
    "entanglement generation is a novel example where quantum feedback is useful @xcite which is described in section [ sec : entgen ] .",
    "a projective measurement - based feedback scheme is described in section [ sec : projqubit ] which connects chaos and quantum feedback control from a different perspective .",
    "this scheme can be used for several purposes such as state purification or enhancing entanglement ( which has been proven for a two - qubit case [ sajat ] ) .",
    "we present reproduced simulations in some of the cases ( section [ sec : projqubit ] ) .",
    "in quantum control the systems we want to control are quantum systems , thus described by the general framework of quantum mechanics . for closed systems",
    "the state is described by a unit vector @xmath4 in a hilbert space @xmath5 ( * state space postulate ) .",
    "the time - evolution of the state of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary operator ( * evolution postulate ) .",
    "when two physical systems are treated as one combined system , the state space of the combined physical system is the tensor product space @xmath6 of the state spaces @xmath7 of the component subsystems ( * composition of systems postulate ) .",
    "quantum measurements are described by a set of measurement operators @xmath8 which act on the state space of the system being measured and satisfy @xmath9 ( the index @xmath10 refers to the measurement outcomes ) . if the state of the system immediately before the measurement is @xmath4 then the probability that we measure @xmath10 is @xmath11 and the measurement leaves the system in @xmath12 ( * measurement postulate ) . * * * *    in many situations we only know a probability distribution about the states in which the system can be , i.e. @xmath13 ( the system is in a _ mixed state ) . in this case , it is convenient to introduce the density operator : @xmath14 . from construction we know that @xmath15 is hermitian , positive and @xmath16",
    ". also , @xmath17 if and only if the system is in a pure state and under a @xmath18 unitary transformation @xmath15 transforms as @xmath19 . _",
    "let us introduce now another class of measurements which provide only partial information about an observable .",
    "we can do this if we choose our measurement operators to be a weighted sum of projectors ( we will denote their eigenstates as @xmath20 ) , each on peaked about a different value of the observable , i.e. @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the normalization factor chosen so that @xmath23 satisfy the completeness relation @xmath9 and we assumed that the eigenvalues of the observable n are @xmath24 .",
    "as an example , if apply this measurement to a completely mixed state ( so @xmath25 ) and obtain the result @xmath10 , the post - measurement state is @xmath26 from which we see that the final state is peaked about the eigenvalue @xmath10 but has a finite width given by @xmath27 .",
    "measurements for which @xmath28 is large are called _ strong measurements and for which @xmath28 is small are called _ weak measurements@xcite . _",
    "_      the above postulates might be enough to treat closed quantum systems ; however , in most practical situations we have to deal with open systems ( for a deep introduction we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "on one hand , this is due to the fact that any realistic system is subjected to a coupling to a second system ( we will use the term _ environment or _ bath for the second system if it is much larger than the first ) in an uncontrollable and non - negligable way . on the other hand , even if one can provide and solve a microscopic description for the combined system , most of the results would be irrelevant .",
    "open systems are also important when we want to monitor ( i.e. continuously measure ) a system .",
    "both cases are essential in quantum feedback control . _ _",
    "we start with a closed system .",
    "the schrdinger equation is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hamiltonian of the system and we have set @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to see that for a mixed state ( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) implies @xmath33\\ ] ] which is called the von neumann or liouville - von neumann equation .",
    "this can be written in the form @xmath34 where one can easily notice the analogy with the classical liouville equation . here",
    ", @xmath35 is the liouville super - operator ( it is a super - operator , since it maps operators to operators ) .",
    "we will drop the hats from the operators from now on .",
    "note , that if we work in the interaction picture , ( [ eq : neumanneq ] ) and ( [ eq : neumannliouville ] ) still hold for the interaction density matrix and interaction hamiltonian ( which we will denote with a subscript @xmath36 ) . we can write ( [ eq : neumanneq ] ) in an integral form as @xmath37 dt'}\\ ] ] we can use this to solve ( [ eq : neumanneq ] ) perturbatively .",
    "formally , it is easy to generalize ( [ eq : neumanneq ] ) to open systems .",
    "consider the case when the system is in a bath ( thus , the hilbert space of the total system is @xmath38 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the total system can be written @xmath39 .",
    "the density matrix of the system can be obtained by tracing out the bath from the density matrix describing the total system ( s+b ) : @xmath40 .",
    "so ( [ eq : neumanneq ] ) takes the form @xmath41\\ ] ] however , in general the dynamics of @xmath42 can be rather involved and we have to make assumptions to proceed .",
    "let us assume that at @xmath43 the system is uncoupled from the environment , i.e. @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents some reference state of the bath .",
    "then the transformation from @xmath43 to some @xmath46 of @xmath42 can be written as @xmath47 .",
    "we introduced @xmath48 which is a map from the system space to itself and is called a _ dynamical map .",
    "it can be shown that these maps represent convex - linear , completely positive and trace - preserving quantum operations .",
    "if we neglect the memory effects in the reduced system dynamics ( justified later ) we can show that they also form a semigroup . under some mathematical conditions",
    "@xcite there exists a linear map ( let us call it @xmath49 ) which is the generator of the semigroup , so we can write @xmath50",
    ". from this we rewrite ( [ eq : neumannliouville ] ) as @xmath51 which is called the _ markovian master equation .",
    "it was shown by lindblad in 1976 that the most general form of @xmath49 ( so that a solution is always a valid density matrix ) is ( assuming that the dimension of the hilbert space of the total system is @xmath52 ) @xmath53 + \\sum_{k=1}^{n^2 - 1 } \\gamma_k \\left(l_k \\rho_s l_k^{\\dag } - \\dfrac{1}{2 } l_k^{\\dag}l_k \\rho_s - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\rho_s l_k^{\\dag}l_k \\right)\\ ] ] where the quantities @xmath54 are non - negative ( and can be shown that physically they play the role of relaxation rate for the different decay modes of the system ) , the operators @xmath55 are arbitrary operators , called the _ lindblad operators , satisfying that @xmath56 is bounded ( although this condition is usually ignored ) .",
    "the first term represents the unitary part of the dynamics and the second term is the dissipative part ( often denoted as @xmath57 $ ] ) . _ _ _    it is possible to derive the generator @xmath49 assuming various underlying hamiltonian dynamics , although several approximations are usually needed . as an example , if we consider a weakly coupled system and use the born - markov approximation @xcite , we obtain the _ born - markov quantum master equation@xmath58 dt'\\ ] ] it is worth mentioning what physical assumptions we made here .",
    "first , we assumed that the bath is only negligibly affected by the interaction .",
    "secondly , we said that environmental excitations decay over times which are not resolved ( in other words , the time scale over which the state of the system varies appreciably is large compared to the time scale over which the reservoir correlation functions decay ) .",
    "_      here we use the formalism introduced in section [ subsec : measurements ] . to describe continuous measurements and to derive the stochastic schrdinger equation and the stochastic master equation .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a broader introduction but we closely follow its lines .",
    "these are the most commonly used equations in quantum feedback control theory .",
    "continuous measurement means that we continually extract information from the system and it can be obtained by performing a weak measurement in @xmath59 time steps with the measurement strength being also proportional to @xmath59 , then taking the limit @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath61 be a hermitian operator ( i.e. an observable ) and for simplicity assume that @xmath61 has a continuous spectrum ( it turns out that the results are valid for any hermitian operator@xcite ) .",
    "denote the eigenstates as @xmath62 , so @xmath63 .",
    "now , in analogy with ( [ eq : weightedsummeasurement ] ) , let us perform a measurement described by the operator @xmath64 at every time step @xmath59 , where @xmath65 is a gaussian - weighted sum of projectors onto the eigenstates of @xmath61 .",
    "choosing the initial state as @xmath66 the probability density @xmath67 of the measurement result @xmath68 is @xmath69=\\left(\\dfrac{4k\\delta t}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/2 } \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } e^{-4k \\delta t ( x - \\mu)^2 } |\\psi(x)|^2 dx\\ ] ] and the mean value of @xmath68 is @xmath70 where we simply plugged in ( [ eq : probdensofmu ] ) and used @xmath71 from where we can also justify our chosen normalization .",
    "now we approximate ( [ eq : probdensofmu ] ) : we replace @xmath72 by a @xmath73-function centered at @xmath74 .",
    "this can be justified because if @xmath59 is sufficiently small , the gaussian is much broader than @xmath75 .",
    "after the substitution and performing the trivial integral we obtain @xmath76 we can represent @xmath68 as a stochastic variable @xmath77 where @xmath78 and its variance is @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 is called the wiener increment and it is worth stopping here and defining it in a more general fashion . the wiener process @xmath81 is a continuous - time stochastic process with three properties : @xmath82 , @xmath81 is almost surely continuous and @xmath81 has independent increments with @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the normal distribution with expected value @xmath10 and variance @xmath85 .",
    "the condition that it has independent increments means that if @xmath86 and @xmath87 then @xmath88 and @xmath89 are independent random variables and similar condition holds for @xmath90 increments .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that at a fixed time @xmath91 , the probability density function of @xmath81 is @xmath92=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi t}}e^{-x^2/2t}\\ ] ] and also the expectation value of @xmath81 is zero and the variance is @xmath91 .",
    "an important rule for the wiener increment is that when we take the infinitesimal limit ( i.e. @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) then @xmath95 this is one of the so called @xmath96 .",
    "the outline of the proof of this statement is as follows .",
    "we consider the probability density function of @xmath97 which we obtain by a simple transformation of ( [ eq : probdensfuncw ] ) . from this",
    "we can see that @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we split up @xmath59 into @xmath100 intervals and sum of the squares of all the corresponding wiener increments , i.e. @xmath101 . now",
    "if we take the continuum limit , this sum becomes a gaussian random variable ( from the central limit theorem ) with mean @xmath91 and variance @xmath102 .",
    "as @xmath103 , this variance vanishes .",
    "so @xmath104 we want this to hold for any interval @xmath105 , so we must have @xmath106 .",
    "this also means that @xmath107 is not a random variable since it has no variance when integrated over any finite inverval .",
    "now let us examine the equation of motion conditioned upon our measurement ( [ eq : weightedsumcontinuous ] ) .",
    "the evolution can be computed ( using only the postulates ) as @xmath108 where we simply applied the measurement @xmath65 at a time step @xmath59 and ignored the normalization and other constant factors .",
    "now expand ( [ eq : condevo1 ] ) to first order in @xmath59 ( which means that we have to keep second order terms in @xmath80 according to the ito - rule ) : @xmath109 { \\arrowvert \\psi ( t ) \\rangle}\\ ] ] now we take the continuum limit , so @xmath110 and we have @xmath111 { \\arrowvert \\psi ( t ) \\rangle}\\ ] ] however , we must be aware of the fact that - for simplicity - we derived this without considering the normalization ( thus we wrote @xmath112 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to take into account the normalization and we obtain @xmath113 { \\arrowvert \\psi ( t ) \\rangle}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 .",
    "this is the well - known _",
    "stochastic schrdinger equation ( sse ) , although not in its most general form ( e.g. we chose the measurement operator to be hermitian ) . in terms of the density operator",
    "this gives @xmath115dt + \\sqrt{2k}(x\\rho + \\rho x - 2{\\langle x \\rangle}\\rho)dw\\ ] ] which is the _ stochastic master equation ( sme ) @xcite without the hamiltonian evolution term .",
    "the first term in the equation describes the drift towards the measurement axis .",
    "the second term describes the update of knowledge of the density matrix conditioned on the measurement .",
    "the measurement record is explicitly @xmath116 in a time interval @xmath117 . @xmath118 and",
    "@xmath119 define a quantum trajectory",
    ". we can write ( [ eq : stochasticschrodingerdensity ] ) in terms of the the measurement record ( [ eq : meausrementrecord ] ) and we have @xmath120dt + 4k(\\{x , \\rho \\ } -2{\\langle x \\rangle } \\rho)(dy - { \\langle x \\rangle}dt)\\ ] ] where the @xmath121 brackets denote the anticommutator .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if one performs the continuous measurement but throws away the record then the sme becomes @xmath122\\ ] ] which can be obtained by averaging over all the possible records and noting that @xmath123 and @xmath124 are statistically independent ( so we can throw away the @xmath124 term in the sme ) . _ _    to have the whole picture , we extend the sme to a more general form , without derivation - it would be fairly straightforward from the markovian master equation ( [ eq : markovianqme ] ) - but interpreting the terms . the most general form of the sme with wiener noise and without taking into account that the noise sources can also be complex and mutually correlated is @xmath125dt + \\sum_n \\mathcal{d}[c_n ] \\rho dt + \\sqrt{\\eta_n}\\mathcal{h}[c_n ] \\rho dw\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is an arbitrary operator , @xmath127\\rho = c\\rho c^{\\dagger}-\\frac12(c^{\\dagger}c\\rho + \\rho c^{\\dagger}c)$ ] is the dissipation superoperator , @xmath128\\rho = c\\rho + \\rho c^{\\dagger } - { \\langle c + c^{\\dagger } \\rangle}\\rho$ ] is the measurement superoperator , we allowed @xmath90 number of measurements ( _ output channels ) and @xmath129 is the efficiency of the @xmath90th detection channel @xcite . _",
    "let us also introduce the ito - integral and its transformation properties .",
    "we often encounter the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath130 @xmath131 is a one - dimensional wiener process .",
    "this , however , makes little sense as @xmath131 is not differentiable .",
    "we can resolve this problem if we write ( [ eq : itoeq ] ) in an integral form @xmath132 or , in analogy with ordinary differential equations @xmath133 and then define the second integral in ( [ eq : itoeqintform ] ) .",
    "there are several possible ways to do it ( e.g. the stratonovich form , ito form ) , we consider the latter : @xmath134 a very important remark is that the ito integral does not obey the usual leibniz rule which is @xmath135 , instead it obeys @xmath136 .",
    "similarly , for an arbitrary function of @xmath137 we have @xmath138 .",
    "as it was mentioned before , feedback control is an ubiquitous and powerful technique for classical systems because - in principle - it is possible to acquire all the information about the state of a system with certainty by using sufficiently precise measurements .",
    "however , there are two fundamental features of quantum systems which have to be taken into account in the quantum case .",
    "the first one is that non - orthogonal states can not be distinguished with certainty .",
    "the second one is that any measurement that gains information about a system induces an uncontrollable noise to it .",
    "therefore , one must carefully design the control scheme to balance the trade - off between information gain and disturbance .",
    "r0.5        qfc can be split up into several subcategories depending on the type of measurement we use or the way we treat the controller .",
    "the two main approaches to information acquistion are strong ( projective ) measurements and continuous weak measurements .",
    "the controller can be considered as a classical object - that is , the gained information is classical - or quantum system which processes -and feeds back - quantum information @xcite . if we assume , that the controller is memoryless and we do not consider any time delays ( so e.g. we can immediately feed back the information ) then it is markovian feedback control and the resulting evolution of the system is described by the markovian master equation ( [ eq : markovianqme ] ) derived in section [ subsec : openquantumsystems ] . in contrast , we can devide the whole control process into two steps : first , we estimate some of the dynamical variables of the state and use the estimated state to design the control .",
    "it is usually desirable to obtain the measurement record continuously , therefore this technique requires real - time solution of stochastic differential equations and fast measurements .",
    "the dynamical equation of the evolution is non - markovian . determining the conditioned state of the quantum system from classical measurement results is a quantum version of bayesian reasoning .",
    "classical bayesian reasoning updates an observers knowledge of a system ( as described by a probability distribution over its variables ) based on new data . for this reason , this feedback paradigm is called bayesian feedback . in @xcite",
    "one can find a good comparison of the markovian and bayesian feedback ; the results prove that the latter is never inferior , and is usually superior , to the former .",
    "however , it would be far more difficult to implement than markovian feedback and it loses its superiority when obvious simplifying approximations are made .",
    "an interesting , somewhat hybrid approach is the lyapunov - method which first constructs an artificial closed - loop controller , simulates it ( e.g. on a computer ) and the open - loop control law is obtained by the result ( `` feedback design and open - loop control strategy '' ) .",
    "the most important aspects of this methodology are : construction of the lyapunov - function , the determination of the control law and the analysis of the asymptotic convergence .",
    "for example , if our desired final state is @xmath139 , we can choose @xmath140 as a lyapunov - function and construct the control law to guarantee that @xmath141 .",
    "in this paper , we do not consider this method further .      in quantum optics",
    "it is a common scenario that the system to be controlled is brought in weak interaction with an external probe field which is subsequently detected @xcite .",
    "here we consider a system which is an ensemble of atomic spins interacting dispersively with an optical probe which is subjected to homodyne detection .",
    "this is an illustrative set - up in several aspects and was experimentally implemented @xcite and theoretically analized for feedback control@xcite . as the detailed derivation from first principles would abundantly exceed the limit of this paper , the stress will be on describing the physical model and key assumptions , rather than the technicalities needed , to obtain the the sme and other main results , which we can further analize and compare it to open - loop control .",
    "we put the atomic spin ensemble in a leaky single - mode cavity and take the problem to be one - dimensional ( which can be justified if we consider that most of the light is scattered forward ) .",
    "the strong driving field is treated semiclassically and polarized light is assumed .",
    "the leaky single - mode cavity description also allows us to treat the interaction between the ensemble and the field with a single frequency , which is chosen to be the laser frequency @xmath142 .",
    "spontanious emission into the eliminated modes can be added to the model phenomenologically . in this model",
    "the total hamiltonian can be written as @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the atomic hamiltonian ( which can be quite involved , depending on the structure of the atoms in the ensemble ) , @xmath145 is the interaction hamiltonian of the cavity mode , @xmath146 is the interaction hamiltonian between the cavity mode and the external field , given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 are the annihilators / creators for the electric field ( they correspond to plane wave modes in the @xmath149-direction ) and @xmath150 are the cavity mode annihilators / creators with @xmath151 , @xmath152 is the mode function .",
    "the remaining hamiltonians are : @xmath153 is the ensemble - cavity mode interaction hamiltonian and @xmath154 corresponds to spontanious emission . note that the quadratures @xmath155 and @xmath156 are gaussian random variables .",
    "we will call @xmath157 quantum white noise as - in the vacuum state - its quadratures have zero mean and delta - correlated covariance .",
    "also note , however , that the whole evolution described by ( [ eq : totalhamiltonian ] ) is not driven by white noise ( i.e. with a fast varying @xmath152 ) .",
    "we have to make a key assumption to obtain this , namely that the cavity is weakly coupled to the external field .",
    "we can define @xmath158 which is a wiener process and we can define integrals @xmath159 as they were defined in ( [ eq : itoint ] ) .",
    "now we introduce a model for the atomic ensemble .",
    "consider @xmath100 atoms with a degenerate two - level ground state .",
    "assume also that all the atomic transitions are far detuned from the cavity resonance ; @xmath160 will denote the collective dipole moment ( so it is a spin - n/2 angular momentum operator ) .",
    "thus , @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the coupling strength and @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the atomic detuning and @xmath165 is the strength of the magnetic field in the @xmath166-direction ( which is under our control ) . if we do not consider feedback control , the open - loop evolution can be written as @xmath167\\ ] ] we can add the decoherence term due to spontanious emission in a phenomenological way as follows . introduce another field @xmath168 with annihilators @xmath169 called the side channel .",
    "this will be left unobserved .",
    "so @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the atomic dipole operator . because the atoms are coupled directly to @xmath172",
    ", we can write @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the atomic decay operator and @xmath175 is the dipole rotation frequency .",
    "this modifies ( [ eq : olcevolutioncoh ] ) with an extra term : @xmath176 + \\gamma \\mathcal{d}[\\sigma]\\rho(t)\\ ] ] where @xmath177 is the decoherence strength and @xmath178\\rho=\\sigma \\rho \\sigma^{\\dagger } -\\frac12 ( \\sigma^{\\dagger } \\sigma \\rho + \\rho   \\sigma^{\\dagger }   \\sigma)$ ] is the dissipative superoperator , just as defined in ( [ eq : generalsme ] ) .",
    "now we introduce our measurement and feedback procedure .",
    "homodyne detection is a powerful technique in practical detection of light beams .",
    "this involves another strong , coherent signal ( called the local oscillator which , in the homodyne case , has the same frequency as that of the detected signal ) which is mixed with the original signal .",
    "this can help to eliminate the initial fluctuations of the laser and allows us to detect a quadrature of the system , e.g. @xmath179 after the field has interacted with the spins ; thus , we observe the photocurrent @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the evolution of the whole system .",
    "it is useful to introduce the integral form of @xmath182 , the integrated photocurrent @xmath183 which is then @xmath184 . using this",
    "we have to solve the quantum filtering problem .",

    "however , we can make use of what we have set up in section [ sec : formalism ] . and perform continuous measurements to speed up the rate of purification .",
    "there are several papers which are concerned about feedback control of two - state quantum systems @xcite , specifically this in @xcite .",
    "the continuous measurement will be performed on the @xmath149-component of the spin-1/2 particle ( so @xmath257 represents the observable ) and we will use the bloch representation with bloch vector @xmath287 . with these",
    "the sme ( [ eq : stochasticschrodingerdensity ] ) in terms of the bloch components becomes @xmath288 from where we can see that - not surprisingly , as the measurement marks the @xmath149-direction - the relation between @xmath289 and @xmath290 is a constant of motion ( the initial angle in the @xmath291 plane , @xmath292 is constant ) . defining @xmath293 we can reduce ( [ eq : blochevo ] ) to @xmath294 we define the impurity of the system as @xmath295 .",
    "this is in general not a good measure of mixedness .",
    "nonetheless , it has a simple analytical form and it is equal to the von neumann entropy in the limit of high purity .",
    "it is possible to obtain the evolution of @xmath296 from the sme using the linear quantum trajectory formulation ( this is an equivalent formulation of the sme in which the equations ( [ eq : blochevodelta ] ) become linear @xcite ) and the solution is @xmath297 which must be solved numerically .",
    "however , we can approximate this in the long time limit ( noting that if @xmath91 is large than the integral does not depend on @xmath91 and using the taylor expansion ) and we have @xmath298 and in the short time limit @xmath299 decays exponentially with rate @xmath300 .",
    "so if we do not consider quantum feedback , the only way to speed up the reduction of the impurity is to increase the measurement strength @xmath28 .",

    "one can calculate that the evolution of the length squared of the bloch vector : @xmath301 and it is apparent that the best increase we can achieve is when @xmath302 so the bloch vector lies in the @xmath291 plane .",

    "we can note two important things .",
    "the first one is that it is a ( real - time ) feedback procedure as we adjust the extra hamiltonian at each @xmath91 depending on the measurement result .",
    "secondly , that to achieve the best efficiency , we must choose the angle such that it exactly cancels the stochastic evolution which kicks out the bloch vector from the @xmath291 plane ; this , however , leads to the choice of @xmath306 which may require an arbitrary large hamiltonian resource .",
    "it is possible to solve the equation of motion and we obtain a simple result @xmath307 from where it is easy to see if we choose a very small target impurity ( so @xmath91 is large ) , the time needed to achieve the target in the first case ( which we can call classical as it is based on a classical idea ) and in the quantum feedback case has a ratio of @xmath308 so it is possible to achieve a speed - up factor of 2 , in the limit when the measurement time is large compared to the measurement rate , with the help of the feedback scheme .",
    "this also allows us to perform state preparation : when the desired purity is achived , we apply a unitary on the system to rotate it to the desired target state .",
    "this is possible because we know that the bloch vector stayed unbiased with respect to the measurement basis .",
    "the speed - up factor is a theoretical upper bound and can be less if we put constraints on the hamiltonian .",
    "this latter case is qualitatively analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it was proved rigorously in @xcite that this is indeed an optimal feedback procedure for the task , using bellman equations and verification theorems .",
    "also , it has been proven in general that in the optimal feedback control regime , it is always preferable to choose the basis of the measurement not to commute with the system density matrix @xcite .",
    "the whole procedure was extended to the two - qubit case , where one is allowed to ( weakly ) measure only one of the qubits ( say the first ) @xcite .",
    "one might expect that the best way to purify the second qubit is to apply the optimal protocol to the first one ; this , however , is not true and was falsified by a counter - example .",
    "one can naturally ask the question : how does this speed - up change if the system is arbitrary in size ?",
    "this was considered in @xcite and it was proven that for an observable with @xmath100 distinct , equally spaced eigenvalues the scheme can boost the rate of purification by at least a factor of @xmath309 ( assuming again infinitely large hamiltonian resource ) .",
    "this generalized problem is significantly more involved than the qubit case and it is an open question whether the feedback procedure which achieves this performance is optimal or not .",
    "there is another important remark . in a realistic setup",
    "we always have to consider the possible sources of delays which can affect the whole feedback loop .",
    "the total effective feedback delay is the sum of delays in the loop as the reciprocal detector bandwidth , the time needed to perform the filtering and control calculations , response time of the actuator ( e.g. laser ) and the electronic delays between the devices .",
    "the aforementioned feedback schemes can only work well if the dynamical timescale of the system is large compared to the effective feedback delay . despite some remarkable developments of the devices ( responsive lasers , electro - optic modulators ) , it is still not the case ; @xcite analyses the protocol when imperfections in the controls are introduced .",
    "they find that delays in the feedback loop have the most effect and for systems with slow dynamics , inefficient detection causes the biggest error .",
    "this was also the motivation for a recently proposed idea @xcite where the feedback procedure is replaced by an open - loop design together with a quantum filtering .",
    "the open - loop control is applied for some time ( which time period is significantly longer than the dynamical timescale of the system ) and the quantum filtering can run parallel or offline ( depending on the control objective ) .",

    "note also that the two qubit itself is a fundamental element of highly entangled states : in quantum computing , all the ( unitary ) entangle operations on many spins can be implemented by compositions of those on the two qubit which is referred to as the universality of quantum circuits .",
    "consider the density matrix @xmath123 of the two qubits which evolves according to the sme given in ( [ eq : stochasticschrodingerdensity ] ) .",
    "specifically , we consider the observable to be @xmath310 , so the system evolves according to @xmath311dt + \\sqrt{2k}((\\sigma_z \\otimes \\sigma_z ) \\rho + \\rho ( \\sigma_z \\otimes \\sigma_z ) - 2{\\langle \\sigma_z \\otimes \\sigma_z \\rangle}\\rho)dw\\ ] ] we want to quantify the entanglement of the system . for this , it is useful to expand the density operator in the pauli basis ( also called as the fano form ) . for two qubits",
    "it takes the form @xmath312 and the coefficients @xmath313 can be found as @xmath314 . from the normalization condition",
    "we also know that @xmath315 .",
    "it is possible to quantify the entanglement between the qubits using @xmath316 . a pure bell - state ( maximally entangled state )",
    "has @xmath317 ; if @xmath318 then there is no classical correlation of the two qubits .",
    "@xmath319 for a product state and for a mixed state , increasing @xmath320 leads to an increase in both purity and entanglement .",
    "@xmath320 is also invariant under single qubit rotations .",
    "these equations provide the basis if one wishes to perform numerical simulations on this problem ; in the following , however , we only focus on the main ideas rather than technical calculations .",
    "let us introduce the concept of decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) .",
    "a dfs is a subspace of the hilbert space of the system that is invariant to non - unitary dynamics , i.e. it remains unaffected by the interaction of the system and its environment .",
    "this was first introduced in a quantum information theory context as these subspaces prevent destructive environmental interactions by isolating quantum information . what are the conditions for the dfs to exist ?",
    "there are several possible formulations in which we can answer this question , e.g. in the hamiltonian formulation , operator - sum representation formulation or the semigroup formulation . here",
    "we give a description using tha latter one ( as all the equations were already set up in the paper ) .",
    "consider the lindblad form of the markovian master equation given in ( [ eq : generalgenerator ] ) .",
    "the dissipative part determines whether the dynamics of a quantum system will be unitary or not ; in particular , when @xmath321=0 $ ] , the dynamics will be decoherence - free .",
    "let @xmath322 span @xmath323 where @xmath324 is the hilbert space of the system . under the assumptions that the parameters @xmath54 are not fine tuned and there is no dependence on the initial conditions of the initial state of the system , a necessary and sufficient condition @xmath325 to be",
    "a dfs is that all basis states @xmath326 are degenerate eigenstates of the error generators ( lindbald operators ) . in our case",
    "we have two decoherence - free subspaces , given by @xmath327 and @xmath328 which can be found by observing that the measurement operator @xmath329 has two degenerate eigenvalues @xmath330 .",
    "one can check that once @xmath123 is restricted to the dfs then @xmath331 according to the sme ( [ eq : smezz ] ) , so the measurement does not extract any useful information .",
    "note , however , that it is easy to rotate the system out of the dfs by applying hadamard gates locally to the qubits and this is an invertible operation .",
    "this means that it is possible to turn on and off the entanglement production procedure without turning on and off the measurement device which has practical advantages .",
    "now comes the essential idea .",
    "first we want to drive the system to the dfs , in which case the system will be in a classically correlated state .",
    "once in the dfs , the system is driven towards the maximally entangled bell state .",
    "this can be done by using only local unitary operations and the measurement of @xmath332 , however , our goal is to make use of jacobs protocol .",
    "let us introduce two encoded qubits : the first will represent the extent to which information is found within the two dfs . if it is in the @xmath333 state then the system is confined to @xmath334 , respectively .",
    "the second qubit contains the information encoded within the dfs .",
    "physical operations can be split into two categories : the ones which commute with @xmath332 and the ones which do not .",
    "the former operations will only affect the second encoded qubit ( as these operations leave the system inside the dfs ) and the latter will only affect the first encoded qubit .",
    "the basic idea is that we apply jacobs protocol to the encoded qubits .",
    "if we rapidly purify the first one , it means that we rapidly forced the system into the dfs .",
    "then we apply the same protocol to the second encoded qubit .",
    "this procedure can be implemented and purifying the second encoded qubit along a specific axis generates entanglement in the physical system @xcite .",
    "note that the fastest rate of purification does not necessarily provide the fastest rate of entanglement generation .",
    "the protocol described in the next section can also be used to provide entanglement generation .      in the context of quantum computation and quantum information , conditional dynamics of qubit systems have gained considerable amount of attantion , as we saw in section [ sec : stabqubitdiscrete ] . and [ sec : puriffeedback ] .",
    "here we introduce another quite exotic - looking transformation @xcite : @xmath335 with the normalization factor @xmath336 , so @xmath337 simply squares the matrix elements .",
    "this transformation can be realized using basic steps involving feedback ; we will restrict ourselves to qubits here .",
    "assume we have two identical copies of the same state @xmath338 and consider the spins ( qubits ) pairwise : @xmath339 .",
    "now apply the well - known xor - gate to the pair which is @xmath340 where @xmath341 means addition mod 2 .",
    "the third and last step is easy again , however , this is the key to the nonlinearity : measure the spin of the second qubit along the @xmath149-axis and keep the pair only if the result is `` down '' .",
    "the whole transformation can be written in a compact form : @xmath342 where @xmath343 .",
    "it can be easily checked that @xmath344 indeed .",
    "the fact that @xmath337 does not preserve the trace means that , with some finite probability , the transformation can fail .",
    "the procedure can be thought as a feedback process because it consists a filtering , based on a ( projective ) measurement record .",
    "there are possible generalizations of @xmath337 .",
    "for example , instead of qubits , we can use arbitrary dimensional hilbert spaces ( with the generalized xor gate introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "this strong feedback based , nonlinear transformation can be used to optimally distinguish between nonorthogonal states or to purify mixed states . as an example of the latter ,",
    "let us consider a qubit pair with density matrix @xmath123 . after we squared the density matrix elements with @xmath337",
    ", we apply @xmath345 ( a rotation in the hilbert space ) with the parametrization @xmath346 and let us choose @xmath347 .",
    "one step of the whole dynamics becomes then @xmath348=u(\\mathcal{s}\\rho)u^{\\dagger}\\ ] ] the goal is to use this transformation to restore one of the bell states which has been perturbed ( due to decoherence , for example ) .",
    "define the @xmath349 state as @xmath350 and assume that our initial state is @xmath351 which has a fidelity @xmath352 with the original @xmath349 state .",
    "figure [ fig : fid1 ] . is a plot of the fidelities at every iteration step .",
    "one can see that after even number of iterations the state converges to the target .",
    "this happens because @xmath349 is the part of the stable cycle the map .",
    "the length of this stable cycle is two , the other member being a state orthogonal to @xmath349 .",
    "the procedure also generates entanglement in this case .",
    "the initial fidelity is @xmath353 .",
    "after @xmath354 20 steps , the iteration converges to the stable cycle @xmath355 .",
    "note , that the convergence is not neccesserily monotonic : after the second iteration we have @xmath356.,width=340 ]    where is the connection between this protocol and chaos ?",
    "this question was raised in @xcite and further analyzed in @xcite .",
    "let us go back to the one qubit case ( the transformation is still @xmath357 , defined in ( [ eq : ftrafo ] ) ) .",
    "let us choose the initial state to be a pure state which we can write in the riemann representation as @xmath358 where @xmath359 is known as the riemann sphere .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath357 transforms a pure state into a pure state and the parameter @xmath149 transforms as @xmath360 what we obtained is a nonlinear map on the riemann sphere with one complex parameter @xmath240 .",
    "these maps have been studied in detail since the beginning of the 20th century by fatou , who studied particularly the map @xmath361 @xcite and later on by g. julia and b. mandelbrot , just to name a few who contributed to the subject .",
    "they showed that even the simplest nonlinear maps on complex numbers can show extremely rich structures .",
    "for example , the famous mandelbrot set emerges from the rather simple - looking map @xmath362 .",
    "@xmath363 is a quadratic rational map , thus its julia set - the set of irregular points - is non - vacous ( for a rigorous treatment of dynamics of complex maps , see @xcite ) .",
    "this is a usual definition for complex - valued maps to be considered chaotic .",
    "for example , consider the case with @xmath364 so @xmath365 .",
    "the julia set is trivial in this case : the unit circle . with a definition analogous to ( [ eq : lyapunov ] )",
    "we can calculate the lyapunov exponent and find that it is a positive value @xcite . in this sense",
    ", we can conclude that our projective measurement - based feedback protocol , if applied iteratively , can lead to true chaos in the mathematical sense .",
    "figure [ fig : julia1 ] . shows the rich structure of the julia set , using reproduced simulations .",
    "the program iterates the map @xmath363 for a given parameter @xmath240 and calculates the number of steps needed to reach the stable cycle for different initial states .",
    "one can observe the fractal - like structure which is a usual property of chaotic systems ; it shows that the convergence properties can change on arbitrarily small scales .",
    "one could also iterate mixed states and see that the purity follows irregular dynamics .",
    "the two qubit case is much more complicated to treat analytically , as the initial state space and the parameter space are considerably larger but in a suitable representation one find chaotic behaviour in entanglement as well @xcite .",
    "the following table summarizes some charateristics of the aforementioned proposals for feedback - induced chaos in quantum systems ( see also section [ sec : quantumchaos ] . ) .     & measurement & classical lim . &",
    "stochastic & space & feedback + lloyd and slotince @xcite & weak & no ? & ? & ? &",

    "red means fastest , green means slowest convergence to the stable cycle ( which can be proven to be the only stable cycle ) . in the blue domains",
    "the iteration does not converge under the criteria of the program , width=188 ]",
    "in this paper , some paradigms for quantum feedback control were reviewed . as quantum feedback control has been a rapidly growing research area at least for two decades now and",
    "therefore is a huge field with extensive literature , the goal was not to survey it as a whole .",
    "rather , to give a fairly self - contained description of selected tasks which can be efficiently done using quantum feedback and to treat them in a consistent formalism .",
    "where it was relevant , comparisons to other control designs were made and we can conclude that for many problems , quantum feedback provides optimal results",
    ". however , some of these results do not take into account the delays which are inevitably present in an experimental setup . with practical considerations ,",
    "it is possible that quantum feedback , at least measurement - based quantum feedback loses its superiority against conventional methods .",
    "this is part of the reason why the field of coherent feedback networks and control is coming into the focus ( for a survey see @xcite ) .",
    "we can also conclude that quantum feedback is linked to fundamental theoretical questions and can institute novel forms of quantum chaos .",
    "in fact , in order to have a satisfactory ( and practically relevant ) quantum mechanical description of the system dynamics , we need the evolution of systems which are being measured",
    ". therefore the evolution of states is naturally conditioned on measurement results in any experimental setup which gives more understanding in the quantum - classical correspondence .",
