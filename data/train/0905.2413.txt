    "information - theoretic limits of fading channels have been thoroughly studied in the literature and to date many important results are known ( see @xcite and references therein ) . generally speaking ,",
    "if the transmission delay is not of concern , the classic shannon capacity for a deterministic additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel can be extended to the ergodic capacity for a fading awgn channel , which is achievable by a random gaussian codebook with infinite - length codewords spanning over many fading blocks such that the randomness induced by fading can be averaged out @xcite@xcite . with the transmitter and receiver channel state information ( csi )",
    "perfectly known , the adaptive power allocation serves as an effective method to increase the ergodic capacity .",
    "this allocation has the well - known `` water - filling '' structure @xcite , where power is allocated over the channel state space .",
    "with such an allocation scheme , a user transmits at high power when the channel is good and at low or zero power when the channel is poor .",
    "when the csi is only known at the receiver , the capacity is achievable with special `` single - codebook , constant - power '' schemes @xcite .",
    "the validity of the ergodic capacity is based on the fundamental assumption that the delay limit is infinite .",
    "however , many wireless communication applications have certain delay constraints , which limit the practical codeword length to be finite .",
    "thus , the ergodic capacity is no longer a meaningful performance measure .",
    "such situations give rise to the notions of _ outage capacity _ , _ delay - limited capacity _ , and _ average capacity _",
    "@xcite@xcite , each of which provides a more meaningful performance measure than the ergodic capacity .",
    "in particular , there usually exists a capacity - versus - outage tradeoff for transmissions over fading channels with finite delay constraints @xcite , where an outage event occurs when the `` instantaneous '' mutual information of the fading channel falls below the transmitted code rate , and a higher target rate results in a larger outage probability .",
    "the maximum transmit rate that can be reliably communicated under some prescribed transmit power budget and outage probability constraint is known as the outage capacity . in the extreme case of requiring zero outage probability",
    ", the outage capacity then becomes the zero - outage or delay - limited capacity @xcite . to study the delay - limited system , the authors in @xcite adopt a @xmath0-block block - fading ( bf ) awgn channel model , where @xmath0 indicates the constraint on transmission delay or the maximum codeword length in blocks .",
    "such a channel model is briefly described as follows .",
    "suppose a codeword is required to transmit within @xmath3 symbols , with the integer @xmath0 being the number of blocks spanned by a codeword , which is also referred to as the interleaving depth ( we call it coding length to emphasize how many blocks over which a codeword spans ) ; it is also a measure of the overall transmission delay .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is the number of channel uses in each block , which is called block length .",
    "a codeword of length @xmath3 is also referred to as a frame , where the fading gain within each block remains the same ( over @xmath4 symbols ) and changes independently from block to block .",
    "the number of channel uses @xmath4 in each block is assumed to be large enough for reliable communication , but still small compared to the channel coherence time .",
    "if the csi for each @xmath0-block transmission is known non - causally at the transmitter , transmit power control can significantly improve the outage capacity of the @xmath0-block bf channel @xcite .",
    "when the csi can be only revealed to the transmitter in a causal manner , a dynamic programming algorithm is developed to achieve the outage capacity of the @xmath0-block bf channel in @xcite .    in the above existing works , the delay limit is either infinite or finite but deterministic .",
    "however , there are indeed some practical scenarios where the delay constraint is both finite and random . for example , in a wireless sensor network operating in a hostile environment , sensors may die due to sudden physical attacks such as fire or power losses .",
    "another example may be a cognitive radio network with opportunistic spectrum sharing between the secondary and primary users , where an active secondary link can be corrupted unpredictably when the channel is reoccupied by a primary transmission .",
    "how fast and reliably can a piece of information be transmitted over such a channel ?",
    "this question motivates us to formally define the maximum achievable information rate over a channel with a random and finite delay constraint , named as a _ dying channel_. this type of dying channels has never been thoroughly studied in the traditional information theory , and important theorems are missing to address the fundamental capacity limits . in this paper , we start investigating such channels by focusing on a point - to - point dying link and model it by a @xmath0-block bf channel subject to a fatal attack that may happen at a random moment within any of the @xmath0 transmission blocks , or may not happen at all over @xmath0 blocks .",
    "note that the delay limit in the case of a dying channel is a random variable due to the random attack , instead of being deterministically equal to @xmath0 as in a traditional delay - limited bf channel .",
    "since the successfully transmitted number of blocks is random and up to @xmath0 , a dying channel is delay - limited and hence non - ergodic in nature .",
    "thus its information - theoretic limit can be measured by the outage capacity .",
    "it is well known that coding over only one block of a fading channel may lead to a poor performance due to the lack of diversity . however , when we code over multiple blocks to achieve more diversity in a dying channel , we must bear the larger possibility that the random attack happens in the middle of the transmission and renders the rest of the codeword useless .",
    "therefore , it is neither wise to span a codeword over too many blocks nor just over one block . we need to consider the tradeoff between the potential diversity and the attack avoidance for the selection of the codeword length over such a dying channel . in other words ,",
    "given a distribution of the random attack , we need to seek an optimal @xmath0 that `` matches '' the number of surviving blocks in a probabilistic sense such that the achievable diversity is maximized and the outage probability is minimized .    in a system with multiple parallel sub - channels ( e.g. , in a ofdm - based system ) ,",
    "each sub - channel may be under a potential random attack .",
    "in such a scenario , we are interested in the overall system outage probability and how the outage probability behaves as the number of sub - channels increases .",
    "this leads us to examine the asymptotic outage behavior for the case of a parallel dying channel .",
    "we will consider two models of random attacks over the sub - channels : 1 ) the case of independent random attacks , where the attacks across the sub - channels are independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) ; and 2 ) the case of @xmath2-dependent random attacks , where the attacks over @xmath2 adjacent sub - channels are correlated and the attacks on sub - channels that are @xmath2-sub - channel away from each other are independent .",
    "in the following , we briefly summarize the main results in this paper :    1 .",
    "we introduce the notion of a dying channel and formally define its outage capacity .",
    "suppose we code over @xmath0 blocks , and the number of surviving blocks is random and up to @xmath0 .",
    "an outage occurs if the total mutual information over the surviving blocks normalized by @xmath0 is less than a predefined rate @xmath5 .",
    "correspondingly , the outage capacity is the largest rate that satisfies an outage probability requirement . 2 .",
    "we study the optimal coding length @xmath0 that `` matches '' the attack time in a probabilistic sense such that the outage probability is minimized when uniform power allocation is assumed .",
    "we then investigate the optimal power allocation over these @xmath0 blocks , where we obtain the general properties for the optimal power vector @xmath6 .",
    "we find that , for some cases , the optimization problem over @xmath6 can be cast into a convex problem .",
    "we further extend the single dying channel result to the parallel dying channel case where each sub - channel is an individual dying channel . in this case",
    ", we investigate the outage behavior with two different random attack models : the independent - attack case and the @xmath2-dependent - attack case .",
    "specifically , we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the outage probabilities for the above two cases with a given target rate . by the central limit theorems for independent and @xmath2-dependent sequences ,",
    "we show that the outage probability diminishes to zero for both cases as the number of sub - channels increases if the target rate per unit cost is below a threshold .",
    "the outage exponents for both cases are studied to reveal how fast the outage probability improves .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system model ] presents the system model for a single dying channel , as well as the definition of the corresponding outage capacity . in section [ sec : uniform power ] , we study the optimal coding length by considering uniform power allocation and derive the lower and upper bounds of the outage probability .",
    "moreover , we obtain the closed - form expression of outage probability for the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) rayleigh fading case . in section [ sec : joint opt ] , we optimize over the power vector to minimize the outage probability . in section [ sec :",
    "parallel ] , we extend the single dying channel model to the parallel dying channel case . in particular , we examine the corresponding asymptotic outage probability with two setups : the independent - attack case and the @xmath2-dependent - attack case , in sections [ sec : indp case ] and [ sec : m - dep case ] , respectively . in section [ sec : outage exponent ] ,",
    "the outage exponents for both cases are examined to reveal how fast the outage probability improves .",

    "we consider a point - to - point delay - limited fading channel subject to a random fatal attack , while the exact timing of the attack is unknown to neither the transmitter nor the receiver .",
    "only the distribution of the random attack time is known to both the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "we further assume that there is no channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) while there is perfect channel state information at the receiver ( csir ) .",
    "the transmitter transmits a codeword over @xmath0 blocks within the delay constraint ; and when the fatal attack occurs , the communication link is cut off immediately with the current and rest of the blocks lost .",
    "we build our model of such a dying link based on the @xmath0-block bf - awgn channel @xcite , which is described as follows .",
    "let @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 be vectors in @xmath21 representing the channel input , output , and noise sequences , respectively , where @xmath20 is the gaussian random vector with zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath22 .",
    "rearrange the components of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 as @xmath23 matrices , denoted as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively ( each row is associated with @xmath4 symbols from a particular block . ) .",
    "a codeword with length @xmath3 spans @xmath0 blocks and the input - output relation over the channel can be written as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a @xmath29 matrix with the diagonal elements being the fading amplitudes .",
    "let @xmath30 be the @xmath31-th column of @xmath24 for @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be the @xmath31-th columns of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "these are related as : @xmath35 which implies that the input symbols on the same row of @xmath24 experience the same fading gain , i.e. , they are transmitted over the same block .",
    "since @xmath34 s are i.i.d random vectors , we can view this channel as @xmath0 independent parallel channels with each channel corresponding to a block .",
    "hence , @xmath3 uses of the original channel corresponds to @xmath4 uses of the @xmath0 parallel channels in ( [ eq : parallel ch model ] ) .",
    "the parallel channels over which a codeword is transmitted are determined by the channel state @xmath36 , which can also be viewed as a composite channel @xcite@xcite that consists of a family of channels @xmath37 indexed by a particular set of @xmath38 . for a block fading channel with delay constraint @xmath0 , it can be modeled as a composite channel @xmath39 as follows : let @xmath40 be the set of all length-@xmath0 sequences of channel gains @xmath41 , which occurs with probability @xmath42 under the joint distribution of @xmath43 .",
    "for each @xmath44 , we associate a channel @xmath45 , where @xmath45 consists of @xmath0 parallel gaussian channels .",
    "let @xmath46 be the fading power gain vector , i.e. , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 be the transmit power allocation vector .",
    "for a given set of @xmath49 and @xmath6 , the maximum average mutual information rate over channel @xmath45 is @xcite : @xmath50 where we assume a unit noise variance throughout this paper .    in our model of the dying channel ,",
    "the delay constraint is random rather than deterministically equal to @xmath0 due to the fact that a random attack may happen within any block out of the @xmath0 blocks or may not happen at all within the @xmath0 blocks .",
    "if the fatal attack happens during the transmission , the current block and the blocks after the attack moment will be discarded .",
    "an outage occurs whenever the total mutual information of the surviving blocks normalized by @xmath0 is less than the transmitted code rate .",
    "therefore , the dying channel is non - ergodic and an appropriately defined outage capacity serves as the reasonable performance measure .",
    "let @xmath51 be the random attack time that is normalized by the block length . as we know from the results of parallel gaussian channels @xcite , with random coding schemes",
    ", we can decode the codeword even if the attack happens within the @xmath0 blocks as long as the average mutual information of surviving blocks is greater than the code rate @xmath5 of the transmission , i.e. , if we have @xmath52 then the codeword is decodable , where the random integer @xmath53 with @xmath17 being the flooring operator .",
    "hence the outage capacity of a dying channel can be formally defined as follows :    the outage capacity of a @xmath0-block bf - awgn dying channel with an average transmit power constraint @xmath54 and a required outage probability @xmath55 is expressed as @xmath56    note that the outage probability above is defined over the distributions of the @xmath57 s and @xmath51 , where we assume that the @xmath57 s and @xmath51 are independent of each other and the transmitter does not know the values of the @xmath57 s and @xmath51 _ a priori _ , but knows their distributions . as we see from ( [ eq : dying channel outage capacity ] ) , there are two sets of variables to be optimized : one is the number of coding blocks @xmath0 , and the other is the power allocation vector @xmath6 . from the perspective of optimal transmission schemes ,",
    "the outage capacity maximization problem is equivalent to the outage probability minimization problem @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we first study the optimal coding length @xmath0 to `` match '' the attack time in a probabilistic sense such that the outage probability is minimized .",
    "as discussed before , we can optimize over the coding length @xmath0 and the power vector @xmath6 to achieve the maximum outage capacity ( or equivalently the minimum outage probability ) .",
    "if a uniform power allocation strategy is adopted , the only thing left for optimization is the coding length @xmath0 . on one hand",
    ", we can have a larger @xmath53 by increasing @xmath0 , meaning that we potentially have higher diversity to achieve a lower outage probability . on the other hand ,",
    "a larger @xmath0 incurs a higher percentage of blocks being lost after the attack such that the average achievable mutual information per block is lower , and hence results in a larger outage probability .",
    "since the random attack determines the number of surviving blocks and @xmath0 determines the average base , we are interested in finding a proper value of @xmath0 to `` match '' the random attack property in the sense that the outage probability is minimized .    with uniform power allocation , according to the law of total probability , the outage probability can be rewritten as a summation of the probabilities conditioned on different numbers of surviving blocks , i.e. : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . given the distributions of @xmath57 and @xmath51 , in general , there are no tractable closed - form expressions for @xmath62 s .",
    "alternatively , we could first seek the bounds of the outage probability and then study more exact forms for some special cases where we show how to find the optimal @xmath0 .",
    "notice that the following relationship holds : @xmath63 since the fading gains @xmath57 s of different blocks are i.i.d , we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the random variable @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , with the relationship in ( [ eq : outage lower bound ] ) , we have a lower bound for the outage probability in ( [ eq : expand outage uniform p ] ) as @xmath66      on the other hand , there exists a simple upper bound for the outage probability : @xmath67 hence yielding @xmath68 therefore , an upper bound for the outage probability in ( [ eq : expand outage uniform p ] ) is given as @xmath69      from the previous discussion , we know how to bound the outage probability in terms of @xmath0 with the general snr values",
    ". however , there usually exists a significant gap between the lower and upper bounds .",
    "fortunately , with appropriate approximations in the high snr regime is large , i.e. , @xmath70 . ] for rayleigh fading , we can obtain a tractable expression for the outage probability and hence further derive a closed - form solution for the optimal @xmath0 .",
    "for our @xmath0-block fading channel model with high snr values , outage typically occurs when each sub - channel can not support an evenly - divided rate budget ( see exercise 5.18 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , conditioned on the attack time @xmath51 , the outage probability can be written as : @xmath71 for rayleigh fading , we have @xmath72 when @xmath73 is large .",
    "thus , when snr is high , we can simplify ( [ eq : outage approx hihg snr ] ) as @xmath74 with the conditional outage probability given by ( [ eq : outage given t ] ) , the overall outage probability is @xmath75 let @xmath76 be the cdf of the attack time , which is assumed to be exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath77 .",

    "let us first consider the convexity of ( [ eq : outage high snr ] ) over a real - valued @xmath0 . by taking the second - order derivative of ( [ eq : outage high snr ] ) over @xmath0",

    "[ fig : parallel dying channel ] , the codeword is spanned in time domain over @xmath0 blocks and also across all the @xmath10 sub - channels . in some sub - channels , random attacks terminate the transmission before it is completed such that less than @xmath0 blocks are delivered . for other sub - channels ,",
    "@xmath0 blocks are assumed to be safely transmitted . what is the maximum rate for reliable communication over such a link ?",
    "for the single channel case , it turns out that there is no way to achieve arbitrarily small outage with a finite transmit power .",
    "however , in this section we show that an arbitrarily small outage probability is achievable by exploiting the inherent multi - channel diversity .",
    "+    in this section , we extend the results of the single dying channel to the parallel multi - channel case .",
    "the outage probability of the parallel multi - channel case is given as @xmath141    where @xmath5 is the total rate over @xmath10 sub - channels , @xmath142 is the fading gain of block @xmath143 at sub - channel @xmath31 , @xmath10 is the number of sub - channels , @xmath144 is the random number of surviving blocks at sub - channel @xmath31 , @xmath0 is the number of blocks over which a codeword is spanned in the time domain , and @xmath54 is the total average power such that @xmath145 is the average power for each sub - channel .",
    "since the asymptotic behavior is concerned , uniform power allocation is assumed over @xmath10 sub - channels . according to different attack models , in the next two sections we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the above outage probability in two cases : the independent random attack case and the @xmath2-dependent random attack case .",
    "let the average power @xmath54 be finite . since @xmath146 if @xmath147 ,",
    "when @xmath10 is large , we rewrite ( [ eq : outage parallel ] ) as @xmath148 we assume that the fading gains @xmath142 s are i.i.d . , and let the random variable @xmath149 be @xmath150 for the case of independent random attack , we assume that @xmath151 s are i.i.d . , and hence @xmath149 s are i.i.d ..    the outage probability given by ( [ eq : outage parallel simple ] ) can be recast as : @xmath152    since @xmath149 s are i.i.d . , according to the central limit theorem , as the number of sub - channels @xmath153 , we have @xmath154 according to theorem 7.4 in @xcite on the sum of a random number of random variables , we derive the following relations : @xmath155 \\label{eq : var_y},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath156 is a nominal random variable denoting the fading gain , @xmath157 is a nominal integer random variable denoting the number of surviving blocks of each sub - channel , and @xmath158 and @xmath159 denote the expectation and variance , respectively .",
    "as such , the outage probability can be approximated as : @xmath160    as @xmath161 , @xmath162 converges to @xmath163 .",
    "the outage probability decreases to @xmath164 over @xmath10 if @xmath165 is less than @xmath163 , or converges to @xmath166 if @xmath165 is larger than @xmath163 .",
    "that is , even though all sub - channels are subject to fatal attacks , the outage probability can still be made arbitrarily small when @xmath10 is large enough if the rate per unit cost is set in a conservative fashion , where @xmath163 is a key threshold .",
    "this is remarkably different from the single dying channel case in which the outage probability is always finite since there are only a finite and random number of blocks to span a codeword .",
    "in the previous section , we discussed the case where @xmath151 s are independent .",
    "however , in a practical system , such as cognitive radio networks , the primary users usually occupy a bunch of adjacent sub - channels instead of picking up sub - channels independently .",
    "thus , the @xmath167 s across adjacent sub - channels are possibly correlated ; and consequently the achievable rates across adjacent sub - channels are also correlated . on the other hand , if two sub - channels are far away from each other , it is reasonable to treat them as independent .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath149 s are strictly stationary and @xmath2-dependent with the same mean and variance .",
    "we first cite the central limit theorem for stationary and @xmath2-dependent summands from @xcite ( theorem 9.1 therein ) .",
    "[ thm : m dep clt ] suppose @xmath168 is a strictly stationary @xmath2-dependent sequence with @xmath169 and @xmath170",
    ". then as @xmath153 , we have @xmath171 where @xmath172 with @xmath173 the covariance of @xmath174 and @xmath175",
    ".    the detailed proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "as assumed , the random sequence @xmath176 is stationary and @xmath2-dependent , and @xmath149 s have the same mean and variance .",
    "then the covariance is given as : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the expectation of @xmath149 given in ( [ eq : mean_y ] ) and @xmath179 .",

    "then ( [ eq : gammaoh ] ) is simplified as @xmath193 where @xmath189 is a non - negative correlation coefficient , @xmath194 and @xmath195 are the mean and variance of the random variable @xmath157 , respectively .    substituting ( [ eq : mean_y ] ) , ( [ eq : var_y ] ) , and ( [ eq : gammaoh simplified ] ) into ( [ eq : vm ] ) , we have @xmath196    according to theorem [ thm : m dep clt ] , we have @xmath197 by simple manipulation , we have @xmath198 where @xmath178 is given in ( [ eq : mean_y ] ) and @xmath199 is given in ( [ eq : cov ] ) .",

    "as we learn from the previous sections , the outage probability over parallel multiple channels goes to zero as @xmath10 increases if @xmath202 for both of the two attack cases . in this section ,",
    "we investigate how fast the outage probability decreases as @xmath10 increases for both cases , which is measured by the outage exponent @xcite defined as @xmath203 where @xmath204 .",

    ". then we can derive the outage exponent numerically by solving ( [ eq : outage exp ] ) for a given @xmath219 .      for the @xmath2-dependent attack case , the techniques used in deriving the outage exponent for the independent attack case does not apply any more since here @xmath149 s are not independent .",
    "in this case , since the outage probability has an approximate normal distribution , we have @xmath220    therefore , an approximate outage exponent can be quantified from the upper bound as @xmath221 where @xmath199 is given in ( [ eq : cov ] ) . the outage exponent obtained by ( [ eq : outage exp ] )",
    "is derived by using the large deviation techniques .",
    "thus , it is exact while the outage exponent given by ( [ eq : exponent dep ] ) for the @xmath2-dependent attack case is approximate .",
