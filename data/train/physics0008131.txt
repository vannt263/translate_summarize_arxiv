    "in the nominal stage of ctf3 , the drive - beam accelerator will have eight klystrons , each feeding two 1m - long structures .",
    "the structures are almost fully loaded , transferring more than @xmath2 of their input power to the beam .",
    "the average energy gain per structure is @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the beam pulse consists of ten short trains of about 210 bunches each .",
    "the first train fills odd buckets , the immediately following second train fills even buckets ; this pattern is then repeated .",
    "an rf - deflector at half the linac frequency is used to separate the trains after acceleration  @xcite .",
    "the initial beam energy is @xmath4 , the final beam energy @xmath5 , the bunch charge @xmath6 , its length @xmath7  @xcite and the transverse normalised emittances are @xmath8 .",
    "the simulations below have been performed using placet  @xcite .",
    "the long - range transverse wakefield is represented by the lowest two dipole modes of each cell .",
    "these have been calculated neglecting the coupling between cells and the effect of the damping waveguides  @xcite .",
    "the damping of the lowest dipole mode has been found  @xcite to be in the range @xmath9 to @xmath10 for perfect loads . in the simulation ,",
    "the modes are confined to their cells , which allows one to take into account the angle of the beam trajectory in the structure .",
    "the loss factors used in the simulation are @xmath11 larger than in  @xcite .",
    "this is to account for the effect of higher - order modes .",
    "also , the damping is conservative in the simulation ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are used for the lowest and the second dipole band .",
    "the short - range longitudinal  @xcite and transverse  @xcite wakefields have been calculated and are included in the simulation .",
    "almost perfect compensation of the long - range longitudinal wakefields is predicted  @xcite .",
    "quadrupole wakefields may be important and have been implemented in placet .",
    "the corresponding modes have not yet been calculated but need to be included in the simulation as soon as they are available .",
    "three different lattices were investigated .",
    "one consists of simple fodo - cells , with one structure between each pair of quadrupoles .",
    "the other two lattices are based on triplets . in one case ( called t1 below ) , one structure was placed between two triplets ; in the other case two structures ( t2 ) . the weaker triplet lattice ( t1 ) and the fodo lattice are roughly comparable in length and cost , whereas the strong triplet lattice ( t2 ) is significantly longer and more costly .    in the fodo lattice , the phase advance is @xmath14 per cell , with a quadrupole spacing of @xmath15 . in t2 one has @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and a distance of @xmath18 between triplets .",
    "the sum of the integrated strengths of the outer two magnets is slightly larger than that of the inner one . with this arrangement , the horizontal and the vertical beta - functions are equal in the accelerating structures , and the energy acceptance of the lattice",
    "is markedly improved .",
    "for t1 the phase advances are @xmath19 and @xmath20 for a triplet spacing of @xmath21 .",
    "the transverse acceptance is @xmath22 for the fodo lattice , @xmath23 for t2 and @xmath24 for t1 .",
    "since the beams have to be compressed after the acceleration , the rf - phase can not be used to optimise the beam transport .",
    "it must be chosen to achieve the required compression and to limit the energy spread of the beam before the combiner ring to the latter s energy acceptance .",
    "an rf phase @xmath25 is used in the following .",
    "no estimate of the transverse jitter of the incoming beam exists . therefore , only the jitter amplification is calculated . in the simulation , each bunch is cut into slices ; the beam is set to an offset of @xmath26 and tracked through the linac . the normalised amplification factor @xmath27 for a slice is defined as @xmath28 here , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are initial and final beam size , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are initial and final beam divergence , @xmath26 is the initial beam offset and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the final position and angle of the centre of the slice . for a slice with nominal energy and without wakefield effects",
    ", one has @xmath35 .",
    "the maximum amplification factor @xmath36 is the maximum over all slices . the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ f : jitt1 ] shows the bunches at the end of the accelerator using the fodo lattice .",
    "different quadrupole strengths were used to find the best phase advance .",
    "some bunches are kicked significantly ; the maximum amplification is @xmath37 . without knowledge of the acceptance downstream and the size of the beam jitter ,",
    "it is not possible to decide whether the amplification is acceptable . within the linac",
    ", even a large jitter of @xmath38 does not lead to beam loss .",
    "the first few bunches in each train are kicked particularly hard .",
    "this can be prevented by adding charge ramps . towards the end of a train that fills even buckets ,",
    "the bunch charge is slowly decreased from the nominal bunch charge to zero . at the same time one",
    "increases the charge in the odd buckets from zero to nominal , to keep the beam current constant .",
    "thus the two consecutive trains practically overlap . on the right - hand side of fig .  [",
    "f : jitt1 ] , one can see that in this case all bunches are well confined , with a maximum amplification of @xmath39 .    in the triplet lattices ,",
    "the horizontal plane has a larger jitter amplification than the vertical one .",
    "but even the horizontal amplifications are significantly smaller than in the fodo lattice .",
    "figure  [ f : jitt3 ] shows the examples of a pulse without charge ramps , the amplification factors being 1.8 ( t2 ) and 1.5 ( t1 ) . with charge ramps ,",
    "they are reduced to 1.5 and 1.3 . if the beam jitters significantly , the triplet lattices are markedly better than the fodo lattice .",
    "to keep operation as simple as possible , only one - to - one correction is considered .",
    "all elements are assumed to be scattered around a straight line following a normal distribution with @xmath40 . in the fodo lattice ,",
    "corrector dipoles are located after each quadrupole and beam position monitors ( bpm ) are placed in front of each quadrupole . in the triplet lattices ,",
    "the corrector dipoles are positioned after the triplets and the bpms are positioned in front and after the triplets .",
    "the correctors are used to bring the average beam position to zero in the bpms . for each case",
    ", 100 different machines are simulated .",
    "the small growths of about @xmath41 are almost the same for all lattices .",
    "the limit on the variation of the bunch energy is @xmath42  @xcite , much smaller than the single - bunch energy spread . in normal operation , the additional dispersive effects are therefore small .",
    "static local energy errors are of more concern and are discussed here",
    ".    the initial and final beam energy can be well measured , and from this the average gradient can be derived .",
    "a local variation of the gradient is more difficult to detect .",
    "it will lead to a quadrupole strength that is not adapted to the beam energy .",
    "the worst case is too low a gradient in the first two structures , which are fed by one klystron . in the simulation ,",
    "100 different machines with a gradient in the first two structures that is too low by @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) are corrected with the beam .",
    "the emittance growth found after correction is @xmath42 ( @xmath45 ) in the fodo lattice and @xmath41 ( @xmath46 ) in t1 , which seems to be sufficiently low . in t2 ,",
    "the value for a @xmath43 error is small , @xmath46 , but for an error of @xmath44 it starts to be large : @xmath47 .",
    "the transverse acceptance is reduced to @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) in the fodo lattice , @xmath50 ( @xmath48 ) in t2 and to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) in t1 .",
    "figure  [ f : energy ] shows the acceptance for a gradient error of @xmath44 . for the fodo lattice , and to a lesser degree also for t2 , one starts to worry about beam losses .",
    "however , an error of @xmath43 seems acceptable with all lattices . to be able to use the fodo lattice or t2",
    ", it necessary to measure the local gradient to better than @xmath43 , to be able to correct the lattice accordingly . for t1 ,",
    "a precision of @xmath44 is sufficient .",
    "the rf power produced by a klystron has a systematic phase variation during the pulse .",
    "one hopes to correct this effect globally , but local variations will remain . to estimate their importance ,",
    "a linear change in phase of @xmath53 over the pulse is assumed for the two structures driven by one klystron .",
    "the next pair has an exactly opposite phase variation .",
    "the resulting bunch - to - bunch energy spread is @xmath46 , full width , which is not acceptable in the combiner ring ; so a better compensation would be needed .",
    "in contrast , the emittance growth seems acceptable with about @xmath54 averaged over 100 machines for all lattices ; the acceptance is hardly decreased .",
    "this phase variation does not cause significant transverse effects .",
    "during commissioning of the linac , large energy errors may occur .",
    "to study the sensitivity to this , 20 machines were simulated for each lattice in the following way : the linac is corrected with a nominal beam ; then the incoming beam is assumed to be accelerated at a different gradient .",
    "figure  [ f : phase ] shows the minimum transverse acceptance of the three lattices as a function of the rf - gradient error .",
    "the final energy error is about @xmath55 times larger than that of the rf - gradient , since the beam loading does not change .",
    "the fodo lattice and t1 have a comparable energy acceptance , whereas that of t2 is slightly smaller . by reducing the focal strength ,",
    "the energy acceptance can be further improved at the cost of higher transverse wakefield effects . by reducing the strength of t2 to @xmath56 and @xmath57 ,",
    "the energy acceptance becomes larger than that of the fodo lattice .",
    "the maximum amplification of an initial jitter increases from 1.8 to 2.6 but is still smaller than the factor 3.7 in the fodo lattice . with each lattice",
    ", the linac energy acceptance is largely sufficient during normal operation .",
    "placet has been modified to also simulate the effects of solenoids with acceleration .",
    "this allows to include the last two structures of the injector which are placed inside a solenoid .",
    "two triplets are used to match the end of the solenoid to the t2 version of the drive - beam accelerator .",
    "the field of the solenoid is @xmath58 and its length is chosen such that a horizontal jitter of the nominal beam leads to a final horizontal offset .",
    "the end fields of the solenoid are modelled as thin lenses .",
    "neither space charge nor the difference of the particle velocities from the speed of light are taken into account , but the wakefields are considered , in contrast to calculations done with parmela  @xcite .    figure  [ f : solenoid ] shows the amplification factor .",
    "while there is some contribution from the structures in the solenoid , the overall amplification seems still acceptable .",
    "the simulations show that the lattices considered here can be acceptable ; the best is the strong triplet lattice t1 .",
    "the triplet lattice t2 seems to be a better choice than the fodo lattice .",
    "the fodo lattice is less expensive than t2 , which is much cheaper than t1 . to find the best compromise ,",
    "more information is needed . for the fodo lattice",
    "the ramps have to be studied in more detail . for all lattices ,",
    "the matching from the injector to the linac and from the linac to the combiner ring needs to be understood ."
