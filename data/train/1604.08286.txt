    "the presence of remnant material from planet formation processes is most commonly revealed around mature , main sequence stars by detection of excess emission , above the stellar photospheric emission , at infrared wavelengths @xcite . the origin of the observed excess is micron- to millimetre - sized dust grains produced in collisions between larger , unseen bodies @xcite .",
    "hence these objects are called debris discs . typically , observed dust emission peaks at either mid- or far - infrared wavelengths with temperatures , derived from blackbody fits to the excess , of @xmath0200  k or 80  k @xcite ; such discs are analogous to the asteroid or edgeworth - kuiper belts , respectively .",
    "hundreds of stars have been identified as debris disk host stars , many of which require multiple debris components echoing the structure of our solar system @xcite . for cool debris discs , i.e. edgeworth - kuiper belt analogues ,",
    "that are more easily detected in contrast to their host stars , an incidence of @xmath0  20 to 30  per cent for afgk - type stars has been measured @xcite , albeit with limitations due to instrument sensitivity and survey strategy .",
    "interferometric measurements of vega , the archetype of debris disk systems @xcite , measured a visibility deficit in the near - infrared @xmath4 and @xmath5 wavebands @xcite .",
    "this deficit was interpreted as being the result of emission originating within the field of view ( @xmath0  200  mas ) , but at spatial scales of several stellar radii , i.e. more extended than the compact stellar emission .",
    "the favoured explanation for this emission was the presence of hot dust , with temperatures in excess of 1000  k , around the host star .",
    "subsequent studies of other systems spanning a broad range of spectral types found similar excesses , some curiously around stars without any other evidence of excess emission @xcite .",
    "surveys combining measurements in @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands found an incidence of hot dust comparable to that of cooler debris discs around main sequence stars , but uncorrelated with the presence of cooler debris @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the excess as being caused by thermal emission from dust is problematic .",
    "any such grains would be close to the sublimation temperature , at small separations of @xmath0  0.2  au .",
    "the presence of grains with properties commonly ascribed to those in cooler belts is also problematic due to the short lifetime against collisional destruction , or removal from the system by radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "dust grains with temperatures ascribed to hot dust would also emit strongly in the mid - infrared , which is not seen @xcite , nor supported by modelling @xcite .",
    "delivery of sufficient dusty material to the star s vicinity from exterior debris belts , e.g. by high orbital eccentricity comets , is likewise difficult to achieve from a dynamical perspective @xcite .",
    "however , some scenarios have been proposed that account for the flaws noted above through e.g. the adoption of more realistic sublimation physics for dust grains @xcite , or the trapping of small , nano - scale dust grains in the stellar magnetic field @xcite . regardless of its origin , at least in the cases of hd  20794 and hd  38858 , the dust responsible must be located close to the host star @xcite . in the interest of completeness",
    "we note that the hot dust phenomenon as a byproduct of the host star s properties has been considered , e.g. winds @xcite or oblateness @xcite ; such mechanisms have generally been ruled out as the cause of this phenomenon .",
    "however , it is clear that alternative mechanisms to account for the presence of these excesses should be explored .",
    "here we investigate the possibility that the near - infrared excesses are due to scattered light , not thermal emission , from dust , while at the same time setting further observational constraints on the grains if the excesses are thermal emission .    a further motivation to examine a scattered light origin of the observed",
    "excess is the direct imaging of habitable zone terrestrial exoplanets @xcite . in the solar system ,",
    "debris dust migrating from the asteroid belt and deposited by comets is pervasive ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sunlight scattered by these dust grains produces the zodiacal light , the faint ( @xmath6 ) inner component of the solar system s debris disk @xcite . around other stars ,",
    "the presence of a strong scattered light background from dust at separations of a few au from the host star constitutes a bright background from which the light from an exoplanet must be disentangled @xcite .",
    "ground - based efforts to characterize this emission for sun - like stars with no infrared excess determined that most ( 95 per cent ) of these exo - zodis are less than 60 times brighter than that of the solar system in the mid - infrared @xcite .",
    "the large binocular telescope interferometer will be sensitive in the mid - infrared to exo - zodis only a few times brighter than the solar system around nearby sun - like stars , probing direct analogues of the solar system @xcite .",
    "deriving constraints on the optical scattered light brightness from these limits is non - trivial .",
    "this is critical , however , since direct imaging searches for exo - earths are supposed to be carried out at such wavelengths .",
    "the detected near - infrared excesses are potentially problematic for the direct detection of exo - earths , since these might be explained by strong scattered - light emission @xcite . to test this hypothesis",
    "we have measured the degree of polarization of six hot dust stars without any notable excess at mid- or far - infrared wavelengths using the high precision polarimetric instrument , a parts - per - million ( ppm , @xmath7 ) sensitivity aperture polarimeter ( hippi ; * ? ? ?",

    "recent measurements of the hot jupiter host star hd  189733 @xcite also return a background polarization magnitude in excess of that expected from the trends identified in @xcite .",

    "@xcite was the first to point out that if a light ray passes through two misaligned dust clouds with different chromatic polarimetric properties then this will rotate the position angle of one wavelength with respect to another .",
    "@xcite have observed this dispersion phenomena in more distant clouds . from the a control group ,",
    "the two stars with the greatest deviation are both northern stars . a reasonable hypothesis to explain this is therefore that the dust in the south is better aligned , predominantly forming a single cloud , whereas the north may contain a variety of unaligned clouds .",
    "we can rule out the chance possibility of oppositely aligned strongly polarizing clouds in the north , since the planetpol survey results show a smooth increase in polarization with distance there @xcite .",
    "thus , given that in the north especially , interstellar polarization within the local hot bubble is very low , misaligned but similarly diffuse clouds are likely to be producing the observed effect .      in section [ sssec : no_pol ] , we determined that the measured polarization of the hot dust stars is consistent with the expected ism contribution , given the stellar distances . from this we placed limits on the total brightness of any exo - asteroid belt around these stars assuming the fractional excesses",
    "were produced by scattered light .",
    "the predicted values for a scattered light origin of the excesses were much greater than the observed polarization magnitudes .",
    "as an aternative to scattered light , we might assume the excess is produced by thermal emission , or some combination of scattered light and thermal emission .",
    "in this case , the relationship between polarization and dust luminosity is given by @xmath78 where the polarization @xmath23 , dust fractional luminosity @xmath79 , polarization fraction @xmath49 , and albedo @xmath80 .",
    "in this instance we need to know @xmath79 , which we calculate to be 3 per cent , under the assumption of blackbody emission with @xmath81  k from temperature constraints given by the slope of @xmath4 and @xmath5 measurements in @xcite and @xcite . for micron - sized dust grains",
    "the albedoes typically span a range 0.1 to 0.3 for silicacious and icy materials , respectively . assuming a 1 per cent fractional excess in the @xmath4 band caused by thermal emission from 1500  k dust at 0.1  au around a sun - like star , the optical scattered fractional brightness ( @xmath82 ) would be in the range @xmath0  20 to 60  ppm @xcite , consistent with both the non - detection of significant polarization by hippi and the derived expectation value of hot dust polarization ( for polarization fractions of 5 to 50 per cent ) .",
    "the observed properties of hot dust are therefore consistent with a thermal emission origin for the excess",
    ".    however , most of the stars in our sample are more luminous than the sun as adopted in the above example .",
    "this requires the adoption of lower albedoes and/or lower polarization fractions to match the measured polarization magnitudes .",
    "low albedo ( @xmath83  0.1 ) , low polarization fraction ( @xmath83  5 per cent ) dust grains are consistent with the measurements , but these properties ( in combination ) are atypical for micron - sized debris dust grains .",
    "sub - micron ( 0.1  @xmath84 m ) dust grains are predicted to have such qualities , and have been attributed as the cause of the hot dust phenomenon through thermal , rather than scattered light , emission @xcite . identifying a combination of dust optical properties and",
    "material consistent with these observations is beyond the scope of this work , but the parameter space defined here is consistent , in varying parts , with commonly adopted materials .",
    "we can rule out scattered light from typical ( micron - sized ) dust grains as the origin of the near infrared excess , being too bright and strongly polarizing , with the caveat that the geometry of the dust might conspire to mask the total polarization signal .",
    "the f / g hot dust stars have a dispersion inconsistent with zero at a significant level , whilst the controls are consistent with zero . if the southern a star control - target pair is added to the three f / g stars this result is little changed .",
    "the @xmath39:@xmath40 ratio is greater in the hot dust groups than their controls ; though not statistically significant , this is likely due to fairly large proportional errors . in combination with the dispersion the difference in ratios hints at an intrinsic polarization by hot dust with a different spectral slope to that of the local ism .",
    "this must be a small effect , much smaller in fact than for more typical debris disk host stars ( marshall in prep . ) , and suggests that the contribution of the hot dust to the total polarization is smaller than that of the ism , even for stars as close as these .",
    "this is consistent with the hot dust phenomenon being attributed to the presence of small nano - scale grains , which would by nature be weakly polarizing .    as alluded to in the introduction , there are potential mechanisms for inducing low level polarization in stars that do not require circumstellar dust .",
    "be star mechanisms can be ruled out as a cause for stellar polarization in this sample due to the range of spectral types .",
    "similarly , none of the stars are noted for strong stellar activity or photometric hotspots , two further causes polarization .",
    "oblateness has been proposed as a cause of stellar polarization @xcite that would also have an increasing effect toward longer wavelengths , although this has not been detected .",
    "three of the stars in this sample have been measured , or are postulated , to be oblate to varying degrees ",
    "hd  2262 ( 0.15 ) , hd  7788 ( 0.20 ) , and hd  187642 ( 0.09 ) @xcite .",

    "the hot dust stars in this sample are all slower rotators and cooler than regulus , such that the magntitude of the induced polarization should be much smaller @xcite and it can not therefore be called upon as a mechanism to explain the observations .",
    "a final possibility for interference with the polarization signal of the hot dust phenomenon is the presence of a close sub - stellar companion to the target star , i.e. a hot jupiter .",
    "the predicted amplitude of hot jupiter - induced polarization is at the 10s ppm level @xcite .",
    "the most recent measurements of hd  189733 support a signal of this amplitude @xcite .",
    "however , there are scenarios that would result in a non - detection of polarization .",
    "concerning geometry , if the debris was distributed smoothly in a disk oriented face - on , the polarization from the dust would cancel evenly leaving little to no detectable signal ; we discount this possibility as being highly unlikely for all six targets in the sample .",
    "likewise a spherical shell of dust grains around the star , perhaps delivered by exo - oort cloud comets , would also produce little measurable polarization ; this is a scenario we can not test with these observations . alternatively",
    ", time variability of the hot dust may also result in a non - detection if the level of dust was low at the epoch of observation .",
    "@xcite validated previous detection of hot dust stars with vlti / pionier and identified only one case , that of hd  7788 ( one of the targets examined here ) , where the hot excess was detected and found to be variable .",
    "the persistence of the hot dust phenomenon over multi - year timescales makes it unlikely that the lack of detections here can be ascribed to variability .",
    "we have measured the optical polarization of starlight at the parts - per - million level for six hot dust excess stars in two wavebands .",
    "these stars do not exhibit excess emission at other , longer wavelengths allowing us to rule out contributions from cooler circumstellar matter to the total polarization .",
    "we also observed a number of non - excess control stars closely situated to the target stars in order to characterise the ism contribution to the total polarization .",
    "the magnitudes of polarization of the hot dust stars are consistent with those of the ism controls . using simple arguments ,",
    "our observations suggest dust grains with low albedos and low polarization as the origin for the observed excesses , incompatible with the scattered light properties of known circumstellar debris disks . from this",
    "we can rule out scattered light from dust in exo - asteroid belts being responsible for the hot dust excesses .",
    "our results favour the interpretation of hot dust as being due to the thermal emission of nano - scale dust grains trapped in the vicinity of the host star . whilst a face - on geometry for",
    "the discs would produce little measurable polarization , such a geometry would be unusual for all six hot dust stars examined here .",
    "we can not rule out a spherical distribution of dust either , but that is not a scenario we wish to examine here .",
    "significant dispersion in the hot dust stars in contrast to southern control stars indicates an intrinsic polarization by hot dust with a different spectral slope to the local ism .",
    "the data implies a greater contribution at redder wavelengths .",
    "the contribution of the hot dust to the measured polarization can only be around 30  ppm or less , consistent with small , sub - micron dust grains .",

    "<S> debris discs are typically revealed through excess emission at infrared wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> most discs exhibit excess at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths , analogous to the solar system s asteroid and edgeworth - kuiper belts . </S>",
    "<S> recently , stars with strong ( @xmath0 1 per cent ) excess at near - infrared wavelengths were identified through interferometric measurements . using the high precision polarimetric instrument ( hippi ) , we examined a sub - sample of these hot dust stars ( and appropriate controls ) at parts - per - million sensitivity in sdss g@xmath1 ( green ) and r@xmath1 ( red ) filters for evidence of scattered light . </S>",
    "<S> no detection of strongly polarized emission from the hot dust stars is seen . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore rule out scattered light from a normal debris disk as the origin of this emission . a wavelength - dependent contribution from multiple dust components for hot dust stars </S>",
    "<S> is inferred from the dispersion ( difference in polarization angle in red and green ) of southern stars . </S>",
    "<S> contributions of 17 ppm ( green ) and 30 ppm ( red ) are calculated , with strict 3-@xmath2 upper limits of 76 and 68 ppm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests weak hot dust excesses consistent with thermal emission , although we can not rule out contrived scenarios , e.g. dust in a spherical shell or face - on discs . </S>",
    "<S> we also report on the nature of the local interstellar medium , obtained as a byproduct of the control measurements . </S>",
    "<S> highlights include the first measurements of the polarimetric colour of the local interstellar medium and discovery of a southern sky region with a polarization per distance thrice the previous maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the data suggest @xmath3 , the wavelength of maximum polarization , is bluer than typical . </S>"
