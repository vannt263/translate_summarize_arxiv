    "different properties emerge .",

    "1995 ) found a large population of red broad - line quasars in radio surveys .",
    "kim & elvis ( 1998 ) discovered red quasars in soft x - ray selected samples .",
    "most strikingly , the 2mass survey ( skrutskie et al .",
    "1997 ) found a large number of red quasars , whose density is of the same order of that of local color - selected quasars ( cutri et al .",
    "survey of these objects revealed x - ray properties completely different from `` normal '' quasars : the x - ray emission is much weaker and the spectra are flatter , suggesting that these objects suffer significant absorption by circumnuclear gas ( wilkes et al .",
    "the existence of these populations is important .",
    "synthesis models for the x - ray ( comastri et al .",
    "1995 , gilli , salvati & hasinger 2001 ) and fir ( risaliti , elvis & gilli 2002 ) backgrounds depend sensitively on knowing the true agn population . similarly , the total accretion luminosity of the universe ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) and the average efficiency of black hole accretion ( and hence spin , elvis , risaliti & zamorani 2002 ) depend primarily on these `` hidden '' populations .",
    "another indication of unexpected x - ray properties of non - color selected quasars comes from the work of risaliti et al .",
    "2001 ( hereafter r01 ) , where a sample of spectroscopically selected quasars of the hamburg survey ( hagen et al .",
    "1995 ) has been cross - correlated with the wga catalogue of rosat pointed observations ( white , giommi & angelini 1995 ) .",
    "more than half of the resulting sample is underluminous in the x - rays , by a factor from @xmath6 to @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , most of these objects are somewhat redder than `` normal '' quasars ( @xmath7 vs. @xmath8 , r01 ) , and would have been probably missed in standard color - based surveys , since we expect their u - b color also to be redder than the average of standard blue quasars .",
    "almost all the objects in this sample were not detected by rosat , therefore the claim on their x - ray weakness is based on upper limits . as a consequence , nothing",
    "is known about their x - ray spectral properties .",
    "the subarcsecond beam size of the _ chandra _ mirrors ( van speybroeck et al . 1997 ) and the large collecting area endows _",
    "chandra _ with far greater sensitivity than rosat .",
    "hence , a _",
    "chandra _ survey can explore the x - ray sample of quasars far better than rosat . here",
    "we present the results of _ chandra _ observations of 18 objects selected from the x - ray weak sample of r01 .",
    "the parent sample was obtained by r01 from the cross - correlation of the hamburg quasar survey ( hereafter hs , hagen et al .",
    "1995 ) with the wga catalogue .",
    "the hs sample consists of 397 quasars , with redshift between 0 and 3 , and limiting magnitude b@xmath9 .",
    "the selection criteria are either the standard u - b colour or the presence of broad emission lines ( or both ) in grism optical spectra . in this way it is possible to discover objects with intrinsically red continua , or with moderate extinction .",
    "the r01 sample contains 85 sources , of which only 31 were detected by rosat . in fig .",
    "1 we show the distribution of x - ray to optical ratios for this sample , compared with the one of pg quasars .",
    "we adopted an index , defined in r01 as i@xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the rosat 0.5 - 2.4 kev count rate .",
    "the reason for using this new index , instead of @xmath12 , is that it uses the observed optical data since , with these redder quasars , an extrapolation to 2500    may be problematic . for quasars with a standard",
    "sed , i@xmath13 .",
    "+ the detected sources in r01 have a rather normal x - ray to optical ratio , while the 54 non - detections are x - ray weaker than most pg quasars . the dashed vertical line in fig",
    ". 1 ( i@xmath14 ) represents the value at which the underluminosity in the x - ray is a factor of 5 with respect to the average of pg quasars . in the following we refer to i@xmath15 as `` x - ray weak '' sources .",
    "we randomly selected 17 sources from the x - ray weak half of the sample .",
    "as a control sample we included three hs quasars not detected by rosat but with upper limits on i@xmath16 lower than 3.2 .",
    "as shown by r01 , there is a strong correlation between the optical o - e color , obtained from the poss plates , and the x - ray to optical ratio . as a consequence , our 17 x - ray weak sources , being a representative sub - sample of the x - ray weak quasars of r01 , are automatically also a representative sub - sample of the red quasars present in the hamburg survey , i.e. those objects that would have not been selected by optical color - based surveys .",
    "18 out of the 20 sources of the sample have been observed with the acis - s detector on _ chandra _ ( weisskopf et al .",
    "2001 ) in the year 2002 . out of these 18 objects ,",
    "16 are from the x - ray weak group , and the remaining 2 are from the small group of 3 control sources .",
    "the observing times vary from 4 to 10 ksec , given the b magnitude of the sources .",
    "the observing times were chosen in order to have the same lower limit on @xmath17 for all the sources , in case of non - detection with _ chandra_. all the sources but one have been detected .",
    "the net source counts range from a few tens counts to @xmath18 for a few bright objects ( tab .",
    "the data were analyzed using the latest acis calibrations provided by the _ chandra _ x - ray center .",
    "a correction was applied to the response matrices to account for the low energy quantum efficiency degradation of the acis detectorasc.harvard.edu@xmath19ciao@xmath19threads@xmath19apply_acisabs@xmath19index.html ] .",
    "we analyzed the acis spectra using a simple model , consisting of an absorbed power law .",
    "both the photon index , @xmath20 and the absorbing column density @xmath21 were left free .",
    "( table 1 ) in fig .",
    "2 we show the results for the 16 objects of the x - ray weak sample , compared with the spectra estimated from the b magnitudes , assuming the normal uv - selected value of @xmath2 ( shaded band in each panel of fig .",
    "we calculated @xmath17 deriving the monochromatic flux at 2500    from the b magnitude , assuming a spectral shape @xmath22 .",
    "this is a conservative assumption because the optical colors of these objects are on average redder than in normal quasars . since for all but three sources the b magnitude central wavelength ( @xmath234400   ) is greater than the redshifted 2500   wavelength , using flatter optical spectra would imply higher extrapolations of @xmath24 at 2500  , and so even higher values of @xmath17 .",
    "the rest - frame 2 kev flux was directly measured from the spectrum .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows : + @xmath25 12 out of the 16 x - ray weak sources are confirmed to be extremely faint in the x - rays , with @xmath17 ranging from 1.7 to 2.3 .",
    "another object , hs 1417 + 4522 , is only marginally weaker than the average at 2 kev ( @xmath26 ) , but is significantly weaker than normal agns at higher energies ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the spectra are on average slightly flatter than the canonical @xmath27 ( risaliti 2002 ) : we computed a stacked spectrum of these 13 sources and we obtained an average photon index @xmath28 .",
    "+ @xmath25 3 out of 16 objects have a `` normal '' @xmath17 , significantly higher than the estimate from the rosat upper limit .",
    "this implies strong variability ( of at least a factor @xmath29 in the 0.5 - 2 kev band ) .",
    "interestingly , these three objects are the only ones in our sample at redshift lower than unity",
    ". we will further discuss these sources in a forthcoming paper .",
    "+ @xmath25 the two `` control sources '' both show a `` normal '' x - ray spectrum . as a consequence ,",
    "there is no indication that a significant fraction of the sources in the left part of the histogram in fig .",
    "1 are x - ray weak .",
    "our best estimate of the fraction of x - ray weak quasars in the hamburg quasars remains the one inferred from the rosat observations , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "since 13 out of 16 objects are confirmed to be x - ray weak by _ chandra _ observations , the fraction of x - ray weak sources in the parent sample of r01 is as high as 13/16 of 50% , i.e. @xmath31% . since the space density of these sources is of the same order of that found in color - selected surveys with similar limiting magnitudes , these objects represent a significant part of the agn population . from the x - ray point of view , they appear to be completely different from standard blue quasars both in @xmath17 and @xmath20 . in principle , two interpretations are possible for the above results : the sources can be either ( 1 ) heavily absorbed or ( 2 ) intrinsically x - ray weak .",
    "\\(1 ) if absorption plays a crucial role , the observed radiation could be due to warm scattering and/or cold reflection erg s@xmath32 .",
    "] while the intrinsic emission would be absorbed by a column density @xmath33  @xmath34 .",
    "these objects are somewhat redder than normal `` blue quasars '' and are all broad line quasars .",
    "we would then have an unlikely column density distribution , with all the optically selected blue quasars having @xmath35  @xmath34 , all the redder quasars having @xmath33  @xmath34 , and nothing in between .",
    "this is an argument favoring the alternative hypothesis of intrinsic x - ray weakness .",
    "( 2 ) if the quasars are intrinsically x - ray weak , the accretion disk / corona system could be in a different state than in normal quasars .",
    "for example , a weaker corona would naturally produce a weaker x - ray emission .",
    "a widely accepted model is that an x - ray emitting corona is generated by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri , balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "this mri generates the viscosity in the accretion disk , so if mri is ineffective little energy should be liberated and the uv continuum and the emission lines should be weak . yet most most of our objects have been selected through the civ 1549    line , and therefore it is unlikely that they have weak ionizing continua .",
    "this paradox clearly needs investigating theoretically .",
    "perhaps mri does not produce disk viscosity or the bulk of the x - rays in normal quasars have another origin .",
    "+ our results show that the current view of the x - ray properties of quasars could be strongly biased by the optical selection towards x - ray loud and steep - spectra objects .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the other known red quasars have properties similar to our objects ( see for example wilkes et al .",
    "2001 for _ chandra _ observations of 2mass quasars ) .    as can be seen from table 1 ,",
    "the x - ray luminosities of our sources are in the range 10@xmath36 erg  s@xmath32 , only slightly higher than the typical luminosities where the bulk of the x - ray background is made , according to synthesis models ( gilli et al .",
    "also , the average spectral properties ( @xmath37 ) are close to those needed by these models",
    ". it could well be that a fraction of the sources predicted to have n@xmath38  @xmath34 , used by current synthesis models are instead intrinsically weak , flat spectrum sources , with normal broad quasar emission lines .",
    "if this is the case , the optical / infrared counterparts of these objects would be completely different from those of the standard type 2 agns : the optical emission would not be obscured , but could be redder than standard blue quasars , and therefore less readily distinguished from stellar emission .",
    "another important difference with respect to the standard view is that the direct optical / uv emission would not be reprocessed at mid / far ir wavelengths .",
    "this would significantly lower the expected contribution of agns to the far ir background ( risaliti , et al .",
    "2002 ) and allowing a larger population of such quasars to be present .    a key test for this hypothesis will be the comparison between the x - ray and optical properties of the sources with x - ray flux @xmath39 erg  s@xmath32  @xmath34 in the _ chandra _ deep surveys .",
    "these objects have luminosities of the order of 10@xmath40  erg  s@xmath32 , where the bulk of the xrb is made , and their observations have enough s / n to distinguish between intrinsically weak and absorbed spectra .",
    "this will make clear whether the x - ray sources described in this work are also common at lower luminosities .",
    "another important step to improve the understanding of this class of sources , will be the study of their optical and near - ir spectra : since they are completely different from normal blue quasars in the x - rays , they could also have quite different optical and near - ir seds . to explore this issue",
    ", we are undertaking optical and near - ir observations of several of the sources in our sample at 4-meter class telescopes .",
