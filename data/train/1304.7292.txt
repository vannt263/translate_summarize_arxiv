    "in hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations , one approximates the ground state by a single slater determinant ( antisymmeterized product of single - particle wavefunctions ) and minimizes the energy , reducing the many - body problem to an effective one - body problem @xcite .",
    "the hartree - fock solution can break exact symmetries , such as rotational invariance , and indeed is often _ more _ effective if it breaks exact symmetries . restoring broken symmetries adds correlations that further lower the energy and is a useful approach for many problems .",
    "in this paper we project states of good angular momentum from a hartree - fock state , and compare the resulting ground state energies and , especially , excitation spectra to exact results from equivalent full configuration - interaction diagonalization in a shell - model basis .",
    "such comparisons help us to understand the accuracy and limitations of the projected hartree - fock approximation ( phf ) , as well as potentially providing a useful shortcut to nuclear structure .",
    "phf is not new @xcite and can be found in a number of variants .",
    "most of these are inspired by the nilsson model @xcite and the elliott su(3 ) model @xcite , and they can be classified by their use of ( a ) quasiparticle single - particle states ( b ) mixing of particle - hole states and ( c ) schematic or realistic interactions .",
    "for example , the projected shell model ( psm ) uses quasiparticle single - particle states but no mixing of particle - hole states and schematic interactions @xcite ; the monster and vampir codes use quasiparticle single - particle states , and mixing of particle - hole states , and realistic interactions @xcite ; and the projected configuration - interaction ( pci ) eschews quasiparticles states but uses realistic interactions and mixes higher - order particle - hole states @xcite . this list is not exhaustive .    what is new in this paper is the comparison of exact numerical solutions against a relatively simple state , with a focus on the quality of the excitation spectra . in this case",
    "the `` exact '' solution is from a full configuration - interaction ( ci ) calculation , using semi - realistic interactions diagonalized in a truncated but nontrivial shell - model basis , against a single hartree - fock state with angular momentum projection .",
    "hence we eschew quasiparticle states and particle - hole states , but we use a realistic interaction and we allow arbitrary deformation .",
    "this paper is similar in philosophy to previous work comparing the random phase approximation ( rpa ) against ci calculations in a ci basis @xcite , testing _",
    "how good is a specific approximation against a numerically exact result _ ; in the former work the approximation was rpa , while here it is phf .",
    "another similar set of papers are those on pci @xcite , which compare results directly to ci diagonalization .",
    "an important difference with much previous work , however , is that in addition to studying the trends of the ground state energies , we consider in detail the excitation spectra .",
    "we find that rotational spectra , and spectra that are from simple particle - rotor coupling , are well reproduced , with a small rms error .",
    "other excitation spectra , such as vibrational spectra or complex spectra from odd-@xmath4 and odd - odd nuclides , have larger rms errors .",
    "this is unsurprising , but it is useful to verify in detail as we have done .    in the next two sections we outline the numerical exact ( ci ) and approximate ( hf and phf ) calculations , which we then compare for a variety of nuclides in section v",
    "we begin by outlining the shell - model basis in which we work and the fundamentals of configuration - interaction calculations @xcite .    we work entirely in occupation or configuration space .",
    "this means that we start with some finite set of orthonormal single - particle states , @xmath5 .",
    "each of these states have good angular momentum and parity and are labeled by orbital @xmath6 , total @xmath7 , and @xmath8-component @xmath9 ; implicitly they have good spin @xmath10 , which here is 1/2 although other values are allowed by our code .",
    "we also have two species of particles , here protons and neutrons , each with fixed numbers .    using second quantization we have fermion creation and annihiliation operators @xmath11 that create or remove a particle from the states @xmath12 .",
    "the uncoupled hamiltonian is then @xmath13 the one - body and two - body matrix elements , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , are appropriate integrals over the hamiltonian and the single - particle states @xcite . because the hamiltonian is an angular momentum scalar , we store the matrix elements in coupled form .",
    "given the single - particle space , the matrix elements are generated externally to all our codes and read in from a file .",
    "any radial form of the single - particle states and any form of the interaction , including non - local interactions , are allowed and make no pratical difference to our many - body codes .",
    "because we work in second quantization , the two - body matrix elements are automatically antisymmeteric and we do not separate direct from exchange terms .    for configuration - interaction ( ci )",
    "calculations we use the bigstick code @xcite .",
    "bigstick creates a many - body basis of slater determinants @xmath16 , constructed from the single - particle basis : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of particles ( occupied states ) .",
    "we fix the total @xmath19 of the many - body basis states , ( this is trivial as each single - particle state has good @xmath9 as well ) and is thus called an @xmath20-scheme code ; because the hamiltonian is an angular momentum scalar , the final eigenstates thus will automatically have good total angular momentum @xmath21 ( and isospin @xmath22 , although we have the capability to break isospin ; @xmath23 is fixed ) . within the fixed single - particle space and fixed @xmath24",
    "we allow all possible configurations .",
    "given the basis , bigstick then computes the many - body hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath25 and finds the low - lying eigenstates , including the ground state , using the lanczos algorithm @xcite . with the single - particle space and hamiltonian matrix elements fixed , the resulting eigenenergies for the full - space ci calculation are numerically exact .",
    "bigstick can handle ci @xmath20-scheme model spaces on a desktop computer up to dimension roughly 2 - 400 million .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation ( hf ) is a variational method using a single slater determinant @xcite .",
    "one applies a unitary transformation among the single - particle states : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of single - particle basis states ( hence the number of particles @xmath28 ) and creates the trial slater determinant @xmath29 then one finds a slater determinant that minimizes the energy , that is , that minimizes @xmath30    because our input matrix elements are antisymmeterized , we fully include both direct and exchange terms .",
    "working in occupation space the exchange term causes us no difficulty ( or , to put it another way , any difficulty is off - shored into calculation of the antisymmeterized integrals ) .",
    "many hartree - fock calculations enforce good angular momentum , for closed - shell systems or closed - shell plus or minus one particle .",
    "our hf code ( the sherpa code @xcite ) allows the slater determinant to break rotational invariance , even for closed - shell systems ; such slater determinants are ` deformed . '",
    "experience in nuclear physics suggest this to be a fruitful path .",
    "our only constraint is that we assume the transformation ( [ usp ] ) to be real .    in order to minimize , we use the standard hartree - fock equations , which consist of iteratively solving @xmath31 where the hartree - fock effective one - body hamiltonian is @xmath32 and @xmath33    we have separate slater determinants for proton and neutrons ; the generalization is straight forward .",
    "more details are found in appendix [ hfcomp ] .",
    "in order to project out angular momentum , we introduce the standard projection operator @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the wigner @xmath38-matrix @xcite , and @xmath39 is the rotation operator .",
    "the rotation operator acts on a slater determinant @xmath40 whose columns are single - particle states with good @xmath41 ; therefore the matrix elements of @xmath42 are given by the wigner @xmath38-matrix : @xmath43 it is useful to note that the @xmath44 for the rotational matrix @xmath42 are those of the single - particle space , while the @xmath45 for the projection operator ( [ jproj0 ] ) are those of the many - body space .",
    "we now introduce the hamiltonian and `` norm '' matrix elements , @xmath46 these are both hermitian .",
    "then we solve the generalized eigenvalue equation @xmath47 where we allow @xmath48 to be complex .",
    "although the deformed hartree - fock state will have an orientation , the final result will be independent of orientation ; we confirmed this by arbitrarily rotating our hf state .",
    "phf will only generate a limited number of states . for a given @xmath21 ,",
    "the maximum number is @xmath49 , although fewer can be found if the norm matrix @xmath50 has zero , or very small , eigenvalues .",
    "this can happen , for example , if the hf state has axial symmetry . therefore there will be states missing from the ci spectrum , such as low - lying excited @xmath51 states .",
    "in this section we apply our calculations to a number of nuclides in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 shells as well as a limited @xmath2-@xmath0 space where we allow for parity - projection as well .",
    "we ask a number of questions :    @xmath52 because phf is a variational theory , the phf ground state energy will be above the exact ground state energy .",
    "we ask : what is the _ systematics _ of that displacement ?",
    "for example , if the displacement were nearly constant , we could use phf to reliably estimate the true ground state energy .",
    "@xmath52 in a similar fashion we ask , how well does phf yield the excitation spectrum ?",
    "@xmath52 for odd-@xmath4 and odd - odd nuclei , how often does phf yield the correct @xmath53 assignment for the ground state ?",
    "@xmath52 for multi - shell calculations , how well does parity+angular - momentum projection yield the splitting of positive and negative parity spectra ?",
    "many previous studies have focused on the ground state energy . by contrast , we focus on the excitation spectrum , as well as systematics of the ground state energy .",
    "we work with several model spaces and interactions .",
    "all model spaces assume some inert core and valence particles ; the single - particle states can be thought of as spherical harmonic oscillator wavefunctions , but that has no impact on our calculations .",
    "the interactions we use are all ` realistic , ' based on effective interactions derived from scattering data but with individual matrix elements adjusted to fit many - body data ( see @xcite for details of methodology ) .",
    "the three model spaces we work in and their interactions are :    @xmath52 _ sd _ , or the 1@xmath54-@xmath55-@xmath56 valence space , assuming an inert @xmath57o core ; the interaction is the universal @xmath0-interaction ` b , ' or usdb @xcite ;    @xmath52 _ pf _ , or the @xmath58-@xmath59-@xmath60-@xmath61 valence space , assuming an inert @xmath62ca core ; the interaction is the monopole - modified kuo - brown g - matrix interaction version 3 g , or kb3 g @xcite ;    @xmath52 and finally the _ psd _ , or @xmath63-@xmath64-@xmath56- @xmath65 valence space , assuming an inert @xmath66he core ; the interation is a hybrid of cohen - kurath ( ck ) matrix elements in the @xmath67 shell@xcite , the older universal @xmath0 interaction of wildenthal @xcite in the @xmath56-@xmath65 space , and the millener - kurath ( mk ) @xmath2-@xmath0 cross - shell matrix elements@xcite . we leave out the @xmath55 orbit is to make full shell - model calculations tractable . within the @xmath2 and @xmath0 spaces we use the original spacing of the single - particle energies for the ck and wildenthal interactions , respectively , but then shift the @xmath0 single - particle energies up or down relative to the @xmath2-shell single particle energies to we get the first @xmath68 state at approximately @xmath69 mev above the ground state .",
    "the rest of the spectrum , in particular the first excited @xmath70 state , is not very good , but the idea is to have a non - trivial model , not exact reproduction of the spectrum .",
    "this model space and interaction allows us to consider model nuclei with both parities and to investigate parity - mixing in the hf state .    to illustrate our results , we begin with @xmath71 mg in the @xmath0 shell . fig .",
    "[ mg24 ] compares the exact ci spectrum on the right against the phf spectrum on the left .",
    "the phf g.s . is 1.78 mev above the ci g.s . , while on average each states in the phf spectrum is shifted by 1.68 mev . for comparison , the correlation energy , here defined as the difference between the unprojected hf energy and the ci g.s .",

    "[ mg24 ] but with the phf spectrum shifted down so the g.s .",

    "the agreement between the excitation spectra is very good , with an rms error of 0.10 mev .",
    "other nuclides shall qualitatively similar results , albeit with varying degrees of accuracy .",
    "in general the phf excitation spectra of even - even nuclides was of much higher accuracy than for odd - odd and odd-@xmath4 nuclides , which is not too surprising as one might expect a deformed hf state to approximate a rotational band .",
    "for example , consider the odd - odd nuclide @xmath73al in the @xmath0 shell , as shown in fig .",
    "the phf g.s . is 6.40 mev above the ci g.s . , and",
