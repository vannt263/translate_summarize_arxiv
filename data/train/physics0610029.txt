    "the role of kinetic effects in stimulated raman backscatter ( srbs ) is of much current interest .",
    "srbs is the three - wave parametric coupling of a pump light wave ( the laser , labeled mode 0 ) to a counter - propagating daughter light wave ( mode 1 ) and co - propagating electron plasma wave ( epw , mode 2 ) , and satisfies the resonance conditions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it may remove a substantial amount of energy from a high - intensity laser propagating through a plasma and create energetic electrons @xcite .",
    "srbs and other laser - plasma interactions must be sufficiently controlled for laser - driven inertial fusion to succeed . in the high - temperature plasmas expected on ignition experiments such as the national ignition facility ( nif )",
    "@xcite and laser mgajoule ( lmj ) @xcite , linear theory of parametric instabilities predicts srbs to have a weak spatial gain rate due to the large @xmath2 ( @xmath3^{1/2}$ ] is the electron debye length ) and resulting heavy landau damping .",
    "however , recent experiments @xcite and kinetic simulations @xcite have shown srbs reflectivities well above coupled - mode convective gain levels .    this kinetic inflation or enhancement of srbs",
    "is widely attributed to electron trapping in the epw potential well , which flattens the electron distribution function near the epw phase velocity @xmath4 @xcite . as has long been known",
    ", trapping reduces the epw damping rate @xcite and induces an amplitude - dependent frequency downshift @xcite .",
    "srbs saturation results from the competition of nonlinear effects including the damping reduction , frequency shift , pump depletion , and trapped particle instability @xcite , and possibly spatio - temporal chaos after ion modes build up near the laser entrance @xcite , among others .",
    "a theory for the onset of kinetic inflation and the resulting time - averaged reflectivity is not yet in hand , but would be of great value for designing laser fusion implosions .",
    "this current work is aimed at better understanding kinetic effects such as electron trapping in srbs for time scales and frequencies such that ion dynamics can be ignored . to this end , we have performed 1-d eulerian vlasov - maxwell simulations of srbs using the elvis code @xcite .",
    "a rapid increase of reflectivity above the convective value is seen as we vary parameters such as the pump intensity .",
    "the system does not reach a temporal steady state when kinetic enhancement occurs , but instead the reflectivity comes in sub - picosecond bursts ( as seen in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . besides enhancing srbs , trapping also changes the electrostatic modes present .",
    "electrostatic spectra from our simulations reveal the epw dispersion curve splits into an upper branch and several beam acoustic modes ( bams ) @xcite , and that srbs involves one of the latter .",
    "the srbs daughter bam activity occurs along the streak that phase - matches for pump decay , which extends down in frequency from the linear phase - matching point with a slope equal to the daughter light wave s group velocity @xmath5 . this behavior has been seen in thomson scattering spectra from recent trident experiments @xcite and pic simulations @xcite .    a low - amplitude acoustic wave ( meaning that @xmath6 , not an ion acoustic wave ) , which we call the electron acoustic wave ( eaw ) , also appears once inflation develops in our simulations .",
    "moreover , weak reflected light that phase - matches for scattering off this mode is also seen , which we call electron acoustic scatter ( eas ) .",
    "this process is reminiscent of what was called stimulated electron acoustic scatter ( seas ) and observed in trident single hot spot experiments @xcite ( although at the most intense pumps , the experimental seas levels relative to srbs are much stronger than in our simulations ) . to our knowledge , this paper is the first to analyze in detail eaws and eas arising from the srbs dynamics , and not from manually - distorted distributions or other strong seeding .",
    "seas has also been reported in pic simulations of plasmas overdense to srbs and at relativistic pump intensities @xcite , and may have been seen in underdense vlasov simulations @xcite .",
    "most of the eaw energy in our simulations is much too low - frequency to match eas and must be produced independently .",
    "we propose the three - wave coupling of two bams and an eaw , which can be called beam acoustic decay ( bad ) , as the eaw excitation mechanism .",
    "smaller - amplitude eaws at higher frequency are subsequently generated by harmonic coupling .",
    "the pump laser then scatters off these fluctuations , referred to below as electron acoustic thomson scatter ( eats ) . the phase - matching needed for bad and eats",
    "is seen both in electrostatic @xmath7 spectra and bispectral analysis .",
    "we study the electrostatic mode structure by solving the linear dispersion relation for simulation distributions projected onto a gauss - hermite basis .",
    "this yields the bams and eaw seen in our simulation spectra , and shows a damping reduction and frequency downshift ( compared to the epw for a maxwellian ) of the bam involved in srbs .",
    "the bams are linearly unstable - in the absence of parametric coupling to light waves - for some wavenumber range . in addition",
    ", we find an eaw root with heavy damping .",
    "this linear eaw differs from the nonlinear eaw due to trapping discussed by others @xcite , which unlike ours is undamped and cuts off at @xmath8 ( in the limit of zero field amplitude ) .",

    "<S> the eaw is strongest well below the phase - matched frequency for electron acoustic scatter , and therefore the eaw is not produced by it . </S>",
    "<S> the beating of different beam acoustic modes is proposed as the eaw excitation mechanism , and is called beam acoustic decay . supporting evidence for this process , including bispectral analysis , </S>",
    "<S> is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the linear electrostatic modes , found by projecting the numerical distribution function onto a gauss - hermite basis , include beam acoustic modes ( some of which are unstable even without parametric coupling to light waves ) and a strongly - damped eaw similar to the observed one . </S>",
    "<S> this linear eaw results from non - maxwellian features in the electron distribution , rather than nonlinearity due to electron trapping . </S>"
