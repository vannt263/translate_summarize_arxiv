    "a theory of deterministic fractal sets and measures , using a backward  algorithm , was developed in hutchinson @xcite .",
    "a different approach using a forward  algorithm was developed in barnsley and demko @xcite .",
    "falconer @xcite , graf @xcite and mauldin and williams @xcite randomized each step in the backward construction algorithm to obtain random fractal sets .",
    "arbeiter @xcite introduced and studied random fractal measures ; see also olsen @xcite .",
    "hutchinson and rchendorff hura and @xcite introduced new probabilistic techniques which allowed one to consider more general classes of random fractals . for further material",
    "see zhle @xcite , patzschke and zhle @xcite , and the references in all of these .",
    "this paper begins with a review of material on deterministic and random fractals generated by ifss , and then introduces the class of @xmath0-variable fractals which in a sense provides a link between deterministic and standard  random fractals .",
    "deterministic fractal sets and measures are defined as the attractors of certain iterated function systems ( ifss ) , as reviewed in section [ secifs ] .",
    "approximations in practical situations quite easily can be computed using the associated random iteration algorithm .",
    "random fractals are typically harder to compute because one has to first calculate lots of fine random detail at low levels , then one level at a time , build up the higher levels .    in this paper",
    "we restrict the class of random fractals to ones that we call random @xmath0-variable fractals .",
    "superfractals are sets of @xmath0-variable fractals .",
    "they can be defined using a new type of ifs , in fact a super  ifs  made of a finite number @xmath2 of ifss , and there is available a novel random iteration algorithm : each iteration produces new sets , lying increasingly close to v - variable fractals belonging to the superfractal , and moving ergodically around the superfractal .",
    "superfractals appear to be a new class of geometrical object , their elements lying somewhere between fractals generated by ifss with finitely many maps , which correspond to @xmath3 , and realizations of the most generic class of random fractals , where the local structure around each of two distinct points are independent , corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "they seem to allow geometric modelling of some natural objects , examples including realistic - looking leaves , clouds , and textures ; and good approximations can be computed fast in elementary computer graphics examples .",
    "they are fascinating to watch , one after another , on a computer screen , diverse , yet ordered enough to suggest coherent natural phenomena and potential applications .",
    "areas of potential applications include computer graphics and rapid simulation of trajectories of stochastic processes  the forward algorithm also enables rapid computation of good approximations to random ( including fully  random ) processes , where previously there was no available efficient algorithm .",
    "here we give an illustration of an application of the theory in this paper . by means of this example",
    "we introduce informally v - variable fractals and superfractals .",
    "we also explain why we think these objects are of special interest and deserve attention .",
    "we start with two pairs of contractive affine transformations , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 @xmath8 with @xmath9\\times \\lbrack 0,1]\\subset \\mathbb{r}^{2}$ ] .",
    "we use two pairs of screens , where each screen corresponds to a copy of @xmath10 and represents for example a computer monitor .",
    "we designate one pair of screens to be the input screens , denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the other pair of screens is designated to be the output screens , denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "initialize by placing an image on each of the input screens , as illustrated in figure [ twofish1 ] , and clearing both of the output screens .",
    "we construct an image on each of the two output screens as follows .",
    "\\(i ) pick randomly one of the pairs of functions @xmath13 or @xmath6 , say@xmath14 .",
    "apply @xmath15 to one of the images on @xmath16 or @xmath17 , selected randomly , to make an image on @xmath18 .",
    "then apply @xmath19 to one of the images on @xmath16 or @xmath17 , also selected randomly , and overlay the resulting image @xmath20 on the image now already on @xmath18 .",
    "( for example , if black - and - white images are used , simply take the union of the black region of @xmath20 with the black region on @xmath18 , and put the result back onto @xmath21 . )",
    "\\(ii ) again pick randomly one of the pairs of functions @xmath5 or @xmath6 , say @xmath22 .",
    "apply @xmath23 to one of the images on @xmath16 , or @xmath17 , selected randomly , to make an image on @xmath24 . also apply @xmath25 to one of the images on @xmath16 , or @xmath17 , also selected randomly , and overlay the resulting image on the image now already on @xmath24 .",
    "\\(iii ) switch input and output , clear the new output screens , and repeat steps ( i ) , and ( ii ) .",
    "\\(iv ) repeat step ( iii ) many times , to allow the system to settle into its stationary state .",
    "what kinds of images do we see on the successive pairs of screens , and what are they like in the stationary state ?",
    "what does the theory developed in this paper tell us about such situations ?    as a specific example , let us choose @xmath26@xmath27@xmath28@xmath29    we describe how these transformations act on the triangle @xmath30 in the diamond @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "see figure [ figurea ] .",
    "then we have @xmath41@xmath42@xmath43@xmath44    in figure [ twofish1 ] we show an initial pair of images , two jumping fish , one on each of the two screens @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in figures [ twofish2 ] , [ twofish3 ] , [ twofish4 ] , [ twofish5 ] , twofish6 , [ twofish7 ] , and [ twofish8 ] , we show the start of the sequence of pairs of images obtained in a particular trial , for the first seven iterations",
    ". then in figures [ final1 ] , [ final2 ] , and final3 , we show three successive pairs of computed screens , obtained after more than twenty iterations .",
    "these latter images are typical of those obtained after twenty or more iterations , very diverse , but always representing continuous random  paths in @xmath1 ; they correspond to the @xmath45stationary state , at the resolution of the images .",
    "more precisely , with probability one the empirically obtained distribution on such images over a long experimental run corresponds to the stationary state distribution .    notice how the two images in figure [ final2 ] consist of the union of shrunken copies of the images in figure [ final1 ] , while the curves in figure [ final3 ] are made from two shrunken copies of the curves in figure [ final2 ] .",
    "this example illustrates some typical features of the theory in this paper .",
    "( i ) new images are generated , _",
    "one per iteration per screen_. ( ii ) after sufficient iterations for the system to have settled into its stationary state , each image looks like a finite resolution rendering of a fractal set that typically changes from one iteration to the next ; each fractal belongs to the same family , in the present case a family of continuous curves .",
    "( iii ) in fact , it follows from the theory that the pictures in this example correspond to curves with this property : for any @xmath46 the curve is the union of little  curves , ones such that the distance apart of any two points is no more than @xmath47 , each of which is an affine transformation of one of at most two continuous closed paths in @xmath48 .",
    "( iv ) we will show that the successive images , or rather the abstract objects they represent , eventually all lie arbitrarily close to an object called a _ superfractal . _",
    "the superfractal is the attractor of a superifs which induces a natural invariant probability measure on the superfractal . _",
    "the images produced by the algorithm are distributed according to this measure_. ( v ) the images produced in the stationary state  are independent of the starting images .",
    "for example , if the initial images in the example had been of a dot or a line instead of a fish , and the same sequence of random choices had been made , then the images produced in figures [ final1 ] , [ final2 ] , and [ final3 ] would have been the same at the printed resolution .",
    "one similarly obtains v - variable fractals and their properties using @xmath0 , rather than two , screens and otherwise proceeding similarly . in ( iii ) each of the sets of diameter at most @xmath47 is an affine transformation of at most @xmath0 sets in @xmath1 , where these sets again depend upon @xmath49 and the particular image .",
    "this example and the features just mentioned suggest that superfractals are of interest because they provide a natural mathematical bridge between deterministic and random fractals , and because they may lead to practical applications in digital imaging , special effects , computer graphics , as well as in the many other areas where fractal geometric modelling is applied .",
    "the main contents of this paper , while conceptually not very difficult , involves potentially elaborate notation because we deal with iterated function systems ( ifss ) made of ifss , and probability measures on spaces of probability measures .",
    "so a material part of our effort has been towards a simplified notation .",
    "thus , below , we set out some notation and conventions that we use throughout .",
    "the core machinery that we use is basic ifs theory , as described in hu81 and @xcite .",
    "so in section [ secifs ] we review relevant parts of this theory , using notation and organization that extends to and simplifies later material . to keep the structural ideas clear ,",
    "we restrict attention to ifss with strictly contractive transformations and constant probabilities . of particular relevance to this paper , we explain what is meant by _ the random iteration algorithm .",
    "_ we illustrate the theorems with simple applications to two - dimensional computer graphics , both to help with understanding and to draw attention to some issues related to discretization that apply _ a fortiori _ in computations  of v - variable fractals .",
    "we begin section [ secthree ] with the definition of a _ superifs _ , namely an ifs made of ifss .",
    "we then introduce associated trees , in particular labelled trees , the space of code trees @xmath50 , and construction trees ; then we review standard random fractals using the terminology of trees and superifss .    in section",
    "[ four ] we study a special class of code trees , called @xmath0-variable trees , where @xmath0 is an integer .",
    "what are these trees like ? at each level they have at most @xmath0 distinct subtrees !",
    "in fact these trees are described with the aid of an ifs @xmath51where @xmath52 is a finite index set , @xmath53s are probabilities , and each @xmath54 is a contraction mapping from @xmath55 to itself .",
    "the ifs enables one to put a measure attractor on the set of @xmath0-variable trees , such that they can be sampled by means of the random iteration algorithm .",
    "we describe the mappings @xmath54 and compositions of them using certain finite doubly labelled trees .",
    "this , in turn , enables us to establish the convergence , as @xmath56 of the probability measure on the set of @xmath0-variable trees , associated with the ifs and the random iteration algorithm , to a corresponding natural probability distribution on the space @xmath50 .    in section",
    "[ five ] the discussion of trees in section [ four ] is recapitulated twice over : the same basic ifs theory is applied in two successively more elaborate settings , yielding the formal concepts of v - variable fractals and superfractals .",
    "more specifically , in section five.1 , the superifs is used to define an ifs  of functions that map @xmath0-tuples of compact sets into @xmath0-tuples of compact sets ; the attractor of this ifs is a set of @xmath0-tuples of compact sets ; these compact sets are named @xmath0-variable fractals and the set of these @xmath0-variable fractals is named a superfractal .",
    "we show that these @xmath0-variable fractals can be sampled by means of the random iteration algorithm , adapted to the present setting ; that they are distributed according to a certain stationary measure on the superfractal ; and that this measure converges to a corresponding measure on the set of fully  random fractals as @xmath57 , in an appropriate metric .",
    "we also provide a continuous mapping from the set of @xmath0-variable trees to the set of @xmath0-variable fractals , and characterize the @xmath0-variable fractals in terms of a property that we name @xmath0-variability . section [",
    "five].2 follows the same lines as in section [ five].1 , except that here the superifs is used to define an ifs  that maps @xmath0-tuples of measures to @xmath0-tuples of measures ; this leads to the definition and properties of @xmath0-variable fractal measures . in section [ five].3",
    "we describe how to compute the fractal dimensions of v - variable fractals in certain cases and compare them , in a case involving sierpinski triangles , with the fractal dimensions of deterministic fractals , fully  random fractals , and homogeneous  random fractals that correspond to @xmath58 and are a special case of a type of random fractal investigated by hambly and others @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , stenflo2 .",
    "in section [ six ] we describe some potential applications of the theory including new types of space - filling curves for digital imaging , geometricmodelling and texture rendering in digital content creation , and random fractal interpolation for computer aided design systems . in section seven we discuss generalizations and extensions of the theory , areas of ongoing research , and connections to the work of others .",

    "the set @xmath82 in theorem [ hutchinson1 ] is called the set attractor of the ifs @xmath139 , and the measure @xmath101 is called the measure attractor of @xmath139 .",
    "we will use the term _ attractor of an ifs _ to mean either the set attractor or the measure attractor .",
    "we will also refer informally to the set attractor of an ifs as a _ fractal _ and to its measure attractor as a _ fractal measure , _ and to either as a _",
    "fractal_. furthermore , we say that the set attractor of an ifs is a _",
    "deterministic _ fractal .",
    "this is in distinction to _ random _ fractals , and in particular to @xmath0__-variable _ _ random fractals which are the main goal of this paper .",
    "there are two main types of algorithms for the practical computation of attractors of ifs that we term _ deterministic algorithms _ and _ random iteration algorithms _ , also known as backward and forward algorithms , c.f .  @xcite .",
    "these terms should not be confused with the type of fractal that is computed by means of the algorithm .",
    "both deterministic and random iteration algorithms may be used to compute deterministic fractals , and as we discuss later , a similar remark applies to our @xmath0-variable fractals .    deterministic algorithms are based on the following :    [ detalgcor]let @xmath140 , or @xmath141 , and define recursively @xmath142respectively ; then @xmath143respectively .",
    "the rate of convergence is geometrical ; for example , @xmath144    in practical applications to two - dimensional computer graphics , the transformations and the spaces upon which they act must be discretized .",
    "the precise behaviour of computed sequences of approximations to an attractor of an ifs depends on the details of the implementation and is generally quite complicated ; for example , the discrete ifs may have multiple attractors , see @xcite , chapter 4 .",
    "the following example gives the flavour of such applications .",
    "[ determ_example]in figure [ texfishx ] we illustrate a practical deterministic algorithm , based on the first formula in equation ( [ alg1 ] ) starting from a simple ifs on the unit square @xmath145 @xmath48 .",

    "note however that the initial image is partitioned into two subsets corresponding to the colours red and green .",
    "each successive computed image is made of pixels belonging to a discrete model for @xmath10 and consists of red pixels and green pixels .",
    "each pixel corresponds to a set of points in @xmath1 .",
    "but for the purposes of computation only one point corresponding to each pixel is used . when both a point in a red pixel and point in a green pixel belonging to say @xmath153 are mapped under @xmath139 to points in the same pixel in @xmath154",
    "a choice has to be made about which colour , red or green , to make the new pixel of @xmath154 .",
    "here we have chosen to make the new pixel of @xmath155 the same colour as that of the pixel containing the last point in @xmath156 , encountered in the course of running the computer program , to be mapped to the new pixel .",
    "the result is that , although the sequence of pictures converge to the set attractor of the ifs , the colours themselves do not settle down , as illustrated in figure [ texture_effect ] .",
    "we call this the texture effect , and comment on it in example [ texture_example ] . in printed versions of the figures representing @xmath151 , and @xmath152 the red and green pixels are somewhat blended",
    ".    the following theorem is the mathematical justification and description of _ the random iteration algorithm_. it follows from birkhoff s ergodic theorem and our assumption of contractive maps .",

    "the random iteration algorithm can be applied to the computation of two - dimensional computer graphics .",
    "it has benefits compared to deterministic iteration of low memory requirements , high accuracy  as the iterated point can be kept at much higher precision than the resolution of the computed image  and it allows the efficient computation of zooms into small parts of an image .",
    "however , as in the case of deterministic algorithms , the images produced depend on the computational details of image resolution , the precision to which the points @xmath167 are computed , the contractivity of the transformations , the way in which equation ( [ weak ] ) is implemented , choices of colours , etc .",
    "different implementations can produce different results .",

    "successive floating point coordinates of points in @xmath10 are computed by random iteration and the first ( say ) one hundred points are discarded . thereafter , as each new point is calculated , the pixel to which it belongs is set to black .",
    "this phase of the computation continues until the pixels cease to change , and produces a black image of the support of the measure , the set attractor of the ifs , against a white background .",
    "then the random iteration process is continued , and as each new point is computed the green component of the pixel to which the latest point belongs is brightened by a fixed amount .",
