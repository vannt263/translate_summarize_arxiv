    "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has been widely adopted in most of the digital video broadcasting standards as dvb - t @xcite , dmb - t , isdb - t .",
    "this success is due to its robustness to frequency selective fading and to the simplicity of the equalization function of the receiver . indeed , by implementing inverse fast fourier",
    "transform ( ifft ) at the transmitter and fft at the receiver , ofdm splits the single channel into multiple , parallel intersymbol interference ( isi ) free subchannels .",
    "therefore , each subchannel , also called subcarrier , can be easily equalized by only one coefficient .    to equalize the signal",
    ", the receiver needs to estimate the channel frequency response for each subcarrier . in the dvb - t standard",
    ", some subcarriers are used as pilots and interpolating filtering techniques are applied to obtain the channel response for any subcarrier .",
    "nevertheless , these pilots reduce the spectral efficiency of the system . to limit this problem ,",
    "we propose to add a two dimensions ( 2d ) linear precoding ( lp ) function before the ofdm modulation .",
    "the basic idea is to dedicate one of the precoding sequences to transmit a so - called spread pilot @xcite that will be used for the channel estimation .",
    "the merits of this channel estimation technique are not only due to the resource conservation possibility , but also to the flexibility offered by the adjustable time and frequency spreading lengths . in addition , note that the precoding component can be exploited to reduce the peak - to - average ratio ( papr ) of the ofdm system @xcite , or to perform the frequency synchronisation .",
    "the contribution of this article is twofold .",
    "first , a general framework is proposed to describe the 2d precoding technique used for channel estimation .",
    "secondly , exploiting some properties of random matrix and free probability theories @xcite @xcite , an analytical study of the proposed estimation method is presented .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section 2 , we present the principles of 2d lp ofdm , and detail the channel estimation technique using the spread pilots . in section 3 ,",
    "we analyse the theoretical performance of this channel estimation by developing the analytical expression of its mean square error ( mse ) .",
    "then , simulation results in terms of mse and bit error rate ( ber ) are presented and discussed in section 4 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",

    "first of all , data bits are encoded , interleaved and converted to complex symbols @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "these data symbols are assumed to have zero mean and unit variance .",
    "they are interleaved before being precoded by a walsh - hadamard ( wh ) sequence @xmath1 of @xmath2 chips , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the chips obtained are mapped over a subset of @xmath5 subcarriers , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the time and frequency spreading factors respectively .",
    "the first @xmath6 chips are allocated in the time direction .",
    "the next blocks of @xmath6 chips are allocated identically on adjacent subcarriers as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ chipmapping ] .",
    "therefore , the 2d chip mapping follows a zigzag in time .",
    "let us define a frame as a set of @xmath6 adjacent ofdm symbols , and a sub - band as a set of @xmath7 adjacent subcarriers .",
    "in order to distinguish the different subsets of subcarriers , we define @xmath8 and @xmath9 the indexes referring to the frame and the sub - band respectively , with @xmath10 .",

    "hence , the transmitted signal on a subset of subcarriers @xmath14 $ ] writes : @xmath17 where @xmath18 \\dots x_{m , s}\\left[i\\right ] \\dots x_{m , s}\\left[l-1\\right ] \\right]^{t}$ ] is the @xmath19 $ ] complex symbol vector , @xmath20 is a @xmath21 $ ] diagonal matrix where @xmath22 is the power assigned to symbol @xmath0 $ ] , and @xmath23 $ ] is the wh precoding matrix whose @xmath24th column corresponds to @xmath24th precoding sequence @xmath25 \\dots c_{i}\\left[n , q\\right ] \\dots c_{i}[l_{f}-1,l_{t}-1 ] ] ^{t}$ ] .",
    "we assume normalized precoding sequences , i.e. @xmath26 = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{l}}$ ] .",
    "since the 2d chip mapping applied follows a zigzag in time , @xmath26 $ ] is the @xmath27th chip of the @xmath24th precoding sequence @xmath1 .",
    "[ t ]      inspired by pilot embedded techniques @xcite , channel estimation based on spread pilots consists of transmitting low level pilot - sequences concurrently with the data . in order to reduce the cross - interferences between pilots and data ,",
    "the idea is to select a pilot sequence which is orthogonal with the data sequences .",
    "this is obtained by allocating one of the wh orthogonal sequences @xmath28 to the pilots on every subset of subcarriers .",
