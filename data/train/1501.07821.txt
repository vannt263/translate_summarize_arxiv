    "ode - locking ( ml ) is a fascinating phenomenon that allows the generation of ultrashort pulses from a laser @xcite and that is still a subject of intense research .",
    "passive ml ( pml ) is arguably the most successful approach and it is achieved by combining two elements , a laser amplifier which provides gain and a saturable absorber ( sa ) acting as a pulse shortening element , see @xcite for a review . pulsed emission with a fundamental period corresponding to the cavity round - trip time arises from the different dynamical properties of the sa and the amplifier , which open a short window for amplification around the pulse @xcite .",
    "ml has led to the shortest and most intense optical pulses ever generated and pulses in the femtosecond range are produced by dye @xcite and solid state lasers @xcite .",
    "large output powers in the watt range are commonly achieved from coupled vecsels - sesam @xcite configurations . on the other hand ,",
    "the large gain of semiconductor materials allows building sub - millimeter monolithic pml lasers .",
    "the round - trip of such short devices is typically of the order of @xmath1 ps and they can therefore reach repetition frequencies of several tens of ghz .",
    "they have also the advantage of being compact , low cost and adaptable to many cavity geometries @xcite , yet their power is in the milli - watt range .    in spite of the research efforts dedicated to the general understanding of the basic issues ,",
    "several aspects of pml still represent a scientific challenge .",
    "for instance , while the breadth of the active medium gain curve is well known to govern the pulse - width , it was only very recently understood that the sa also provides a strongly asymmetric and non linear filtering .",
    "such an usually overlooked effect was recently proven to be the key mechanism explaining wavelength instabilities in pml lasers @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent studies indicated that the optimal position of the sa in the cavity was not following intuitive rules @xcite .",
    "similarly , it was commonly thought until recently that pml semiconductor lasers can not operate at low repetition rates due to the fast recovery time of their material gain ( @xmath2 ns ) which should limit them to high repetition frequencies ( @xmath3 ghz ) .",
    "too long cavities result in the so - called regime of harmonic mode - locking in which several pulses circulate in the cavity , according to the background stability criterion @xcite . until recently , the record of the lowest frequency pml was experimentally attained around @xmath4mhz @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown that _ _ , _ _ in the limit of cavity round - trip much longer than the gain recovering time , mode - locked pulses may coexist with the zero intensity background and can be interpreted as _ temporal localized structures _",
    "( ls ) @xcite .",
    "localized pulses can be independently addressed and used as elementary bits of information , hence the cavity can be used as an all - optical buffer , as shown in @xcite .",
    "a single localized pulse can be activated within the cavity , independently from the cavity size , thus leading to arbitrary low repetition rates which allowed establishing a new low frequency record of @xmath5mhz @xcite .",
    "the possibility of addressing individually localized pulses opens interesting possibilities for the optical generation of arbitrary trains of narrow pulses , which has a large number of potential applications in different domains , e.g. time - resolved spectroscopy , pump - probe sensing of material properties , generation of frequency combs , optical code division multiple access communication networks @xcite and lidar @xcite .    in this manuscript ,",
    "we show how localized pulses form in a passively mode - locked semiconductor broad - area vcsel coupled to a resonant saturable absorber mirror ( rsam ) .",
    "the vcsel bias current is used as a control parameter for addressing localized pulses and for generating patterns of closely packed narrow pulses . the experimental evidences and",
    "theoretical analysis pave the path towards an optical arbitrary pattern generator of short light pulses .",
    ", scaledwidth=37.0% ]    our vcsel is a @xmath6 nm device manufactured by ulm photonics @xcite .",
    "its standalone threshold current ( @xmath7 ) is about @xmath8ma , though emission is localized only at the periphery of the device up to @xmath9ma , after which roll - off starts to occur .",
    "the @xmath6 nm rsam ( batop gmbh ) has a transverse dimension of @xmath10mm@xmath11 and it exhibits a low unsaturated reflectivity of @xmath12 that increases up to @xmath13 when saturated .",
    "the rsam saturation fluence is @xmath14j.@xmath15 .",
    "these values are obtained at the rsam resonant wavelength which can be thermally tuned over @xmath16 nm ( between @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the rsam resonance is around @xmath19 nm and the saturable absorption recovery time is around @xmath20ps .",
    "the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "both the vcsel and rsam are mounted on temperature controlled substrates which allow for tuning the resonance frequency of each cavity ; parameters are set for having the emission of the vcsel resonant with the rsam .",
    "the light emitted by the vcsel is collected by a large numerical aperture ( 0.68 ) aspheric lens and a similar lens is placed in front of the rsam .",
    "a @xmath21 reflection beam splitter allows for light extraction from the external cavity and to monitor both the vcsel and the rsam outputs .",
    "intensity output is monitored by a @xmath22ghz oscilloscope coupled with fast @xmath1ghz detector .",
    "part of the light is sent to two ccd cameras ; the first one records the near - field profile of the vcsel , while the second records the vcsel s far - field profile .",
    "the external cavity length round - trip ( @xmath23 ) is fixed at @xmath24ns which corresponds to a @xmath25mhz fundamental repetition rate .",
    "the combination of the vcsel and the rsam in self - imaging condition does not induce an appropriate ratio of the saturation parameters for obtaining pml .",
    "notwithstanding , mode - locking was obtained when placing the rsam surface in the exact fourier transform plane of the vcsel near - field profile , i.e. when imaging the vcsel far - field profile onto the rsam surface @xcite . as a consequence , the vcsel profile was imaged onto itself after a single external cavity round - trip , but inverted ( i.e. a magnification factor of @xmath26 ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , such configuration leads to the generation of two opposed tilted plane waves , i.e. waves that have a propagation wave - vector slightly out of the cavity axis @xmath27 and which travel in the external cavity with an opposite transverse component and alternating each other at every round - trip .",
    "each one of these plane waves gives birth to a train of mode - locked pulses separated by twice the external cavity round - trip ( @xmath28 ) , while the two trains are time shifted of @xmath23 .",
    "intuitively , one understands that injecting the fourier transform of the vcsel near - field profile into the rsam strongly favors the emission of a tilted wave from all points of the vcsel , since the fourier transform of such an emission consists in a tight focused single spot that saturates easily the rsam . while this scheme leads to conventional mode - locking and harmonic mode - locking for cavity lengths and round - trips shorter than the gain recovery time ( @xmath29 ) , we operate the system in the regime of long cavities , i.e. @xmath30 , and for bias currents below the laser threshold . in these conditions , as shown in @xcite , several emission states , including the zero intensity ( off ) solution , coexist for the same values of bias current .    280  ma and @xmath24ns .",

    "[ traces]e ) .",
    "the case of @xmath33 pulses circulating within the cavity represents the largest number of pulses that can be obtained for the size of the external cavity chosen .",
    "all the above listed pulsing solutions coexist in the parameter space for a wide range of vcsel pumping current @xmath36 .",
    "the pulse width can not be determined precisely from the oscilloscope traces shown in fig .",
    "[ traces ] , which are limited by our real - time detection system ( 10  ghz effective bandwidth ) .",
    "however , an estimation of the pulse width can be obtained from the optical spectrum of the output , which exhibits a broad spectral peak whose fwhm is around 0.12  nm that corresponds , assuming a time - bandwidth product of 0.4 , to a pulse width of 10  ps fwhm .",
    "the pulse was also detected by a 36  ghz detector , which confirms a pulse width of less than 12  ps fwhm considering the oscilloscope bandwidth limit .",
    "finally , the pulse peak power has been measured to be @xmath20watt .",
    "the multistability between a large number of different solutions is shown in fig .",
    "[ traces]g ) , where we plot the bifurcation diagram of these solutions as a function of the pumping current .",
    "figure  [ traces]g ) is obtained increasing the parameter @xmath36 from @xmath37ma , where only the steady off solution is stable , up to the value where this solution loses its stability ( @xmath38ma ) and then sweeping it down until a periodic emission with @xmath33 pulses per round - trip appears , see fig .",
    "[ traces]f ) . in analogy to spatial localized structures",
    "@xcite , this state corresponds to the fully developed temporal pattern which is , together with the coexisting stable off solution , at the origin of the localized structures .",
    "as @xmath36 is decreased , the state with @xmath33 pulses per round - trip loses its stability and the system bifurcates progressively towards states with smaller numbers of ls , until a single one is present in the cavity .",
    "each state is spontaneously appearing as @xmath36 is scanned downward and , once a new state appears , we increase @xmath36 to explore its stability up to @xmath39 ma .",
    "as far as the system remains on the same branch there is no change in the pulse arrangement , thus showing that , even if several arrangements are possible , once one is chosen , it is stable versus parameter changes . figure  [ traces ] indicates that in this regime , mode - locked pulses in our system can be interpreted as temporal localized structures , i.e. any pulse is independent from the other and it can be individually addressed .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the localized character of the pulse implies that the pulse is localized not only in the intensity but also in all the variables describing the system .",
    "this means that , after the short intensity pulse emission , the gain and saturable loss variables recover their steady state value on a longer time scale thereby defining the effective temporal extent of the ls .",
    "this is the main difference between localized pulses and conventional mode - locked pulses . in the latter case , which is obtained for pumping levels above laser threshold",
    ", the gain does not recover to its steady state value between pulses .",
    "this is well explained by the background stability criterion @xcite which states that a pulsating solution is stable if losses are larger the gain between pulses .",
    "since the laser is pumped above threshold , the only stable pulsating solution is the one having a number of pulses in the cavity large enough such that , in - between pulses , gain can not recover sufficiently to overcome the unsaturated loss level .",
    "this implies that fundamental mode - locking is possible only for @xmath29 . in the case of localized pulses",
    ", we are in the opposite limit and the gain can recover fully between pulses because the maximal gain level remains below the unsaturated loss level , even for an infinitely long interval between pulses .",
    "thus , localized pml pulses have no lower limit in their repetition rate , as shown in fig .",
    "[ traces]a ) where a repetition rate of 66.6  mhz is obtained . on the other hand",
    ", the recovery time of the slowest variable , in our case the gain recovery time , determines the effective temporal extent of the localized pulse , since no other pulse can occur before the recovery of all the variables .",
    "another important difference between localized pulses and conventional mode - locked pulses is that , for a given set of parameters , the energy of the localized pulses does not depend significantly on the number of pulses circulating inside the cavity .",
    "instead in conventional mode - locking the energy of the system is shared between the pulses which circulate inside the cavity and fundamental mode - locking is preferred over harmonic mode - locking for maximum pulse energy .",
    "f).[diagcavlong ] ]    in order to represent the evolution of the localized pulses travelling within the cavity over many round - trips , we use the so - called space - time diagram representation where the temporal trace is folded onto itself at the cavity round - trip period .",
    "accordingly , the round - trip number @xmath40 becomes a pseudo - time variable while the pseudo - space variable corresponds to the timing of the pulse modulo @xmath23 .",
    "this representation is similar to the one used for following the evolution of pulses along optical fibers where fast and slow time scales are well separated and it has been proposed also for delayed system @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ diagcavlong]a - d ) we show some space - time like diagrams obtained from the same time traces used for fig .",
    "[ traces ] where all the situations depicted coexist for the same parameter values .",
    "panel a ) shows the evolution of a single ls in the external cavity , while panel b ) , c ) and d ) represent the evolution of respectively @xmath41 and @xmath42 pulses . in all the situations ,",
    "the pulses do not visibly jitter over the considered timescale of @xmath43s and they seems to be insensitive to the surrounding noise .",
    "this can be attributed to the presence of the saturable absorber which acts as an effective noise eater . while the rsam opens a very short window of net gain around the pulse , the remaining low intensity emission from the vcsel",
    "is absorbed by the rsam .",
    "accordingly , the background shown in fig.[diagcavlong ] is homogeneous and corresponds to zero emission .    in presence of localized structures , as the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ diagcavlong ] , the possibility of forming bounded states of localized structures , also called molecules , naturally arises.when gathered in molecules , the pulses are not independent anymore , while the molecule itself becomes a compound localized structure which is independent from other localized structures that may travelling within the cavity .",
    "such molecules have been widely observed in fiber lasers @xcite and in general only a few if not an unique equilibrium distance separates the `` atoms '' of a molecule .",
    "the signature of such bound states of ls in a space - time like diagram is the presence of preferred distances between two neighbor pulses .",
    "we have never found any preferred distances between close pulses in the space - time like diagrams that we have analyzed .",
    "instead we have observed a _",
    "continuum _ of temporal separations .",
    "one can understand the absence of molecules in our system by the specificity of the interaction between neighbor ls .",
    "indeed , it is known that the gain depletion induced by each ls produces a repulsive interaction @xcite that decays over a time scale @xmath44 .",
    "the potentially attractive interaction mediated by the oscillating tails of the pulses vanishes after a few times the effective pulse width , i.e. a time scale of @xmath45ps . as such ,",
    "this clear scale separation between the attractive and repulsive forces explain why ls molecules would be hard to obtain with semiconductor active materials",
    ".    it may be useful to compare our results with the extensive literature on mode - locking .",
    "localized pulses in mode locked laser might have been observed in the past .",
    "for example , several papers mention pml regimes obtained at _ exceedingly low _ frequencies with respect to the limits of the background stability criterion ; repetition rates of the order of few hundreds mhz were reported in@xcite .",
    "we believe that these regimes could be explained in terms of ls . while it is difficult to know exactly the experimental conditions of these works , in @xcite it is clearly mentioned that the off solution coexists with the pml solution . the experimental result reported recently in @xcite , claiming mode - locking at a repetition rate of 85.7  mhz ,",
    "can also be explained in terms of ls . in this work , neighboring pulses of @xmath46ps fwhm , separated of @xmath20ns ,",
    "are interpreted theoretically as bound states .",
    "while the experimentally observed distance corresponds to the vanishing of the repulsive interaction induced by the gain depletion @xcite , the theoretical analysis is performed after adiabatically eliminating the carrier dynamics , thus neglecting such repulsive interactions .",
    "we believe that this approximation in @xcite , correct for fiber lasers but not for semiconductor devices , has led to a wrong interpretation of independent neighbor pulses in terms of bound states resulting of the locking of the oscillating tails of the pulses .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the most important property of localized structures is their mutual independence which allows for their individual addressing .",
    "the localized pulses that we have obtained can be individually triggered by shining light pulses inside the cavity , as we have shown numerically in @xcite . by encoding an information bit in the form of a localized pulse",
    ", our system can be operated as an all - optical buffer , similar to the one proposed using fiber kerr resonator with a driving field @xcite , but taking advantage of the compactness and fast response of semiconductor materials as in @xcite .",
    "the buffer bit - rate depends on the minimal time interval between two independent pulses , i.e. the temporal extent of the ls which is , in our case , fixed by the gain recovery time . the experimental results shown in fig .",
    "[ traces]f ) indicate that a separation of 1  ns is certainly sufficient to avoid interaction between pulses , thus leading to buffer bit rate of @xmath47ghz . while the all - optical addressing of the mode - lock localized pulses is the topic of ongoing research ,",
    "the nucleation of a single pulse can be observed when perturbing mechanically the system , as shown in fig .",
    "[ allumage ] . yet",
    "this kind of perturbation does not allow any control of the switching ; it may lead to the nucleation of several pulses at the same time with random positions within the cavity .",
    "notwithstanding , a higher degree of control can be implemented when perturbing the bias current of the vcsel . the main limitation using",
    "this parameter comes from the frequency response of the vcsel to a modulated signal coupled onto the pumping current via a bias t. the electrical characteristics of the broad - area vcsel we used , together with the bandwidth of the bias - t used , limit the frequency modulation below 0.3  ghz .",
    "accordingly , the individual addressing of localized pulses via the emission of electrical pulses suffers from the too long rise time of the perturbation .",
    "nevertheless a sinusoidal modulation of the pumping current with a period corresponding to the cavity round - trip @xmath23 allows for the excitation of localized pulses in a narrow time interval within the round - trip time , i.e. a well - defined vertical band of the space - like variable , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ diagcavlong ] .",
    "the idea would be to modulate the current between a lowest value where the off solution is the only possible solution up to a highest value where the fully developed temporal pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ traces]f ) is also the unique possible situation .",
    "since this modulation is synchronous with the cavity round - trip , a portion of this monostable temporal pattern will appear only in correspondence with the modulation signal peak .",
    "once the sinusoidal perturbation of the pumping current is removed , the portion of the monostable pattern will give way to a solution with one , two or more localized pulse depending on the continuous bias current value of the vcsel , see fig .",

    "the result of this experiment is shown in fig .",

    "[ traces]f ) , i.e @xmath50 .",
    "once the modulation signal is removed , the continuous value of pumping current does not support the stable existence of six localized pulses and the system bifurcates towards the state with a single pulse per period .",

    "second , modulation is applied with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 460  ma and 6  ls appear close to the peak of the modulation ( green , middle line ) .",
    "when we switch - off current modulation , only a single ls remains in the cavity ( blue , top line ) .",
    "[ buffertrace ] ]      the experiment reported above suggests that a current modulation can be used to obtain a pattern of closely packed localized pulses .",
    "this functionality is appealing for many applications like e.g. ocdma @xcite and lidar @xcite , since narrow optical pulses ( < 10 ps ) are typically obtained using conventional pml systems which deliver a periodic train of pulses with no versatility in the pulse arrangement .",
    "pulse patterning can be of course obtained by adding optical gates based on electro - optical modulators , but these solutions are expensive , energetically inefficient , and their implementation requires synchronization between the pulse source and the gating .",
    "we implement a pulse pattern generator by driving the system pumping current with a forcing at a period equal to the cavity round - trip and which brings the system into the monostable region where only the periodic pattern of pulses is stable , according to fig .",

    "this corresponds to the laser reaching exactly threshold at some instant since @xmath92 and such low and broad intensity pulses ( not shown ) can be interpreted as locally amplified spontaneous emission .",
    "the first real ls appears at @xmath98 . upon increasing further the modulation amplitude , the pulses energy slowly increases which explains the slope of the plateau ( the experiment considering only the pulse number ) while the jumps correspond to the apparition of another pulse .",
    "notice in addition that the pulses within a group may have slightly different intensities .",

    "interestingly , one is able to reach much lower values for the modulation amplitude .",
    "the value of @xmath99 corresponds to a maximal gain of @xmath100 which is very close to the value of @xmath94 , i.e. the minimal value of the current in dc allowing for the existence of a single ls .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "[ theo_modj_diag ] is normalized in such a way that the integrated intensity of a single pulse at the minimal bias current is unity .",
    "we remark that if we have bistability between 1 and 4 pulses , say for instance at @xmath101 , this certainly implies that we can also have 2 and 3 pulses .",

    "[ theo_modj_scantau ] ]    experimental results also shown a strong sensitivity of dynamics with respect to the modulation period .",
    "we notice that the period of the pml regimes scales as @xmath102 , see @xcite for instance .",
    "the pulsewidth is proportional to the inverse of the filter bandwidth and there is a deep relation between pulsewidth and deviation of the pulse train period from the value given by the time of flight .",
    "one can intuitively consider that @xmath71 is the `` inertia '' of the filter .",
    "as such , if a short pulse , say a dirac delta , is re - injected after a time of flight @xmath23 , the filter needs a typical time @xmath103 to filter and re - emit it . in our case",
    ", we found that for @xmath92 the fundamental period is @xmath91 which explains why we choose this value in our analysis .",
    "we depict in fig .",
    "[ theo_modj_scantau ] the sensitivity to the modulation period for a low amplitude modulation of @xmath98 .",
    "one can verify from fig .",
    "[ theo_modj_diag ] that in this case we can have either 1 or 4 pulses . in order to have a simple picture",
    ", we start from an initial condition with as many pulses as possible , i.e. the harmonic mode - locking of maximal order found just threshold at @xmath104 in the absence of modulation @xmath105",
    ". then we suddenly decrease @xmath65 toward @xmath92 and set the modulation to @xmath98 .",
    "such a method allows us to find the maximal number of packed pulse that the system can support as a function of the detuning of the modulation frequency .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ theo_modj_scantau ] that indeed a precise tuning is necessary as the full width of the resonance tongue is @xmath106 , i.e. of the same order of magnitude than the pulsewidth .",
    "saying that the resonance tongue if of the order of the pulsewidth yields a bandwidth of @xmath107ps/@xmath108khz in good qualitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "we have shown that electrically biased broad - area vcsels with optical feedback from a rsam can be operated in a regime where the passively mode - locked pulses can be addressed and controlled individually when the compound system is operated below threshold .",
    "the strong multistability between the off solution and a large variety of pulsating solutions with different number and arrangements of pulses per round - trip , demonstrate that the mode - locked pulses are mutually independent .",
    "we show how a modulation of the bias current allows controlling the number of the pulses travelling within the cavity , paving the way an arbitrary pattern generator of picosecond pulses .",
