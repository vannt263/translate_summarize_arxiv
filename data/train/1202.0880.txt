    "the phenomenon of stochastic resonance ( sr ) , initially put forth theoretically to explain the occurrence of ice ages , at a certain frequency , on earth@xcite , have been observed experimentally in many physical@xcite and biological systems@xcite .",
    "sr has been investigated theoretically and experimentally with considerable interest over the past three decades@xcite .",
    "its attraction lies in the seemingly counter - intuitive idea that by tuning noise level ( externally or internally ) the response of a nonlinear system to a weak external periodic signal can be enhanced considerably ; or a nonlinear system itself tunes the noise level in order to enhance a particular chosen signal .",
    "moreover , the noise level at which the response peaks depends on the frequency of the input signal . as a consequence",
    ", it may have potential applications in the detection of weak signals as well as in the selection of a signal of a particular frequency out of a host of signals of different frequencies@xcite . as a corollary ,",
    "a biological system can tune noise level internally to select and enhance a desired signal@xcite .",
    "apart from potential practical applications , it offers considerable theoretical challenges .",
    "the occurrence of sr in bistable systems@xcite has more or less been confirmed and reported fairly widely@xcite .",
    "however , its occurrence in periodic potentials is still debatable@xcite , though there have been some investigations in monostable@xcite and periodic potential systems@xcite as well .",
    "there have been some discussion on sr in periodic potentials in view of obvious practical importance of these potentials , such as in describing motion of adatoms on crystal surfaces@xcite , superionic conductivity , rcsj model of josephson junction@xcite , etc .",
    "the conventional sr is considered to occur in a bistable system at a temperature when the signal frequency matches the time rate of passage across the potential barrier of the nonlinear system@xcite .",
    "analogously , one would expect , for instance , the frequency dependent mobility , as a response , to peak as a function of temperature , at a signal frequency corresponding to the mean passage rate across a potential barrier of the periodic potential .",
    "however , instead , the mobility shows monotonic behaviour around that frequency .",
    "it does show a peak with temperature only at a much higher frequency .",
    "this mobility peaking with temperature is termed as a kind of dynamical resonance , unlike the sr satisfying the conventional criterion of frequency matching , and merely confined to intrawell motion@xcite .",
    "this aspect has been examined more closely in a recent numerical work@xcite on a sinusoidal potential considering hysteresis loop area as response to the input signal @xmath1 .",
    "hysteresis loop area ( hla ) , in the average position - forcing , @xmath2 , space , or equivalently , the input energy lost by the system to the environment per period of the external forcing @xmath3 , is considered as an appropriate measure of sr .",
    "hla has been considered as a quantifier of sr earlier too@xcite .",
    "however , recently hla was found to show sr behaviour close to what was shown by the amplitude of the average particle - position variable @xmath4 in a bistable system@xcite .",
    "hla not only includes information of the mean amplitude @xmath5 of @xmath4 but also its phase relationship with the external forcing or the input signal @xmath3 .",
    "its significance as an appropriate quantifier of sr has also been pointed out recently@xcite . moreover , in a periodic potential",
    ", it is very likely that the particle forays into wells far away , on either direction , from the initial well .",
    "it makes the position variable unsuitable for any meaningful quantification of sr .",
    "it is found that the hla or input energy loss takes account of motion whether it is in a single well or spread over several wells .",
    "also , hla shows qualitatively similar behaviour as the frequency dependent mobility calculated using the linear response theory@xcite .",
    "the hla has recently been used as a quantifier of sr in a underdamped periodic potential system@xcite .    in ref.@xcite",
    "it was pointed out that the peaking of hla as a function of temperature at high frequencies ought not to be dismissed as merely a dynamical resonance@xcite .",
    "the phenomenon can be seen as a result of transitions between two dynamical states of the damped driven particle trajectories in the highly nonlinear ( sinusoidal ) potential .",
    "the two and only two dynamical states exist and are distinguished by their trajectory amplitudes and their phase relationship with the field @xmath3 .",
    "the relative stability of the two states changes as the temperature ( noise strength ) is varied .",
    "it is hard to prove analytically that an underdamped particle moving in a sinusoidal potential driven by a periodic force of frequency close to the natural frequency at the bottom of a well of the potential and subjected to fluctuating forces can have only two dynamical states of its trajectories as it was found numerically .",
    "solution of only the simplest situation of the deterministic motion of a driven pendulum without friction , + @xmath6 , + given the initial condition @xmath7 , can be obtained analytically and its phase trajectories drawn@xcite .",
    "notice that the periodic potentials @xmath8 and @xmath9 are equivalent except for a phase difference of @xmath10 . also , the trajectories with initial conditions @xmath11 and @xmath12 should be identical except that they are in opposite directions in case of closed orbits and in @xmath13 sectors in case of travelling solutions .",
    "in other words , the two trajectories should have the same amplitude but different phase relationship with the external forcing .",
    "however , for different initial conditions ( @xmath14 ) , they can have different trajectories and not necessarily confined to just two particular trajectories .",
    "but , when damping is present , it is easy to appreciate that if two trajectories have different phases they will necessarily have different amplitudes and hence different energy contents .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "( curve @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 ( curve @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( curve @xmath19).,width=377,height=302 ]    consider the two extreme cases of particle motion being ( i ) in - phase , and ( ii ) completely out - of - phase with the external drive .",
    "1 shows the periodic potential when @xmath20 ( curve o ) , @xmath16 ( curve a ) , and @xmath18 ( curve b ) , where @xmath21 , so that the total potential @xmath22 .",
    "consider the extreme position p1 of the particle on the curve a when @xmath16 . in the next moment",
    "the @xmath3 will decrease and also the particle position moves to the left so that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are in phase .",
    "they being in phase implies that when @xmath20 the particle is at the potential bottom p2 and when @xmath18 the particle is at p3 , the extreme position on the left and is about to roll down the potential hill as @xmath3 begins to rise from @xmath23 . from the figure , therefore , one could notice that in this case of in - phase situation the particle always moves on the stiffer slope of the potential @xmath24 .",
    "on the other hand , if we were to begin from the particle position p4 on a while @xmath16 , the particle always moves lying on the gentler slope of @xmath24 in this completely out - of - phase case .",
    "since the force experienced by the particle due to the potential in the two cases have different values one would naturally expect the damped particle to have different amplitudes of motion and hence have different energy losses due to frictional forces .",
    "the two dynamical states are thus distinct .    at low temperatures , for given @xmath3 , depending only on the initial conditions the system chooses one of the two dynamical states .",
    "these two states are quite stable@xcite and no transition occurs between them .",
    "however , as the temperature is increased transition takes place between the dynamical states and , as a result , the relative population of these states changes .",
    "thus , the mean amplitude of the trajectories and the overall phase when averaged over the initial conditions vary with temperature . the hysteresis loop area shows a peak at a temperature indicating stochastic resonance where the transition rate between the dynamical states acquires a particular value .",
    "it is also important to notice that well before the hla peaks , the particle begins to surmount the potential barrier of @xmath24 and at resonance the motion is no longer confined to a single well of @xmath24 ; the inter - well transitions become quite numerous .",
    "of course , the inter - well transition rate is still quite low compared to the transition rate between the dynamical states@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we show that a driven underdamped particle exhibits stochastic resonance in ( i ) a periodic bistable potential , @xmath0 , and also in ( ii ) washboard potentials ( tilted sinusoidal as well as tilted periodic bistable potential ) . in this work we use hla as a quantifier of sr but also supported by the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the appropriateness of the hla as a quantifier of sr vis - a - vis the snr has been discussed extensively in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the snr has been used in many earlier works to discuss sr . without going into the relative merits of these quantifiers we present the snr to complement extensive results that we show in terms of hla .",
    "as has been pointed out@xcite the quantifiers do not peak at the same temperature .",
    "however , our main contention that sr is a distinct possibility in periodic potentials is reinforced by the results of snr .",
    "is shown with two similar subwells in a well of the potential.,width=377,height=302 ]    in the case of bistable periodic potential too , effectively , two and only two dynamical states ( one in - phase and one out - of - phase ) of trajectories of a periodically driven underdamped particle are obtained .",
    "since in a potential well of @xmath25 there exist two similar subwells ( fig .",
    "2 ) there are two ( one in - phase and one out - of - phase ) states in each subwell .",
    "the in - phase ( out - of - phase ) state in one subwell has the same amplitude and phase relationship as the in - phase ( out - of - phase ) state in the other subwell .",
    "therefore , energetically there exist only one in - phase and one out - of - phase states of trajectories .",
    "however , as time progresses , these trajectories can also be in wells and subwells other than the initial ones , the basins of attraction of the dynamical states can be identified in different wells and subwells .",
    "consequently , the basins of attraction of the dynamical states become more complex than in case of sinusoidal potentials where only trajectories in different wells are distinguished .    in the case of periodic bistable potentials hla , as also the signal - to - noise ratio , shows a peaking behaviour , just as in the case of sinusoidal potential , as the temperature is varied .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour of hla as a function of temperature is related to the relative stability of the in - phase and out - of - phase states of trajectories .",
    "moreover , the particle does make inter - well transitions also .",
    "the washboard potentials , that is a slanted sinusoidal potential and slanted bistable periodic potential , naturally yield finite particle drifts . as a consequence the hysteresis loops do not close .",
    "however , upon correcting for the drift factor , as explained in sec .",
    "iii , the hysteresis loops close and the closed hysteresis loop areas could be made to agree with the input energy loss .",
    "the hla ( or the input energy loss ) so obtained again shows peaking behaviour as the temperature is varied .",
    "this is a clear signature of sr in the washboard potential .",
    "the occurrence of sr could again be explained in terms of transition between the two dynamical ( one in - phase and one out - of - phase ) states of particle trajectories that are realized even in these washboard potentials .",
    "we consider motion of an underdamped particle along ( i ) a periodic bistable potential @xmath26 , ( ii ) a tilted sinusoidal potential @xmath27 , and ( iii ) a tilted bistable potential @xmath28 , where the tilt @xmath29 represents a constant force .",
    "as mentioned earlier ( fig.2 ) @xmath25 has two subwells of equal depth ( bistable ) in each periodic well of the potential .",
    "@xmath25 is symmetric about @xmath30 , where , @xmath31 .",
    "the latter two potentials we shall refer to as the washboard potential and the bistable washboard potential , respectively , for @xmath32 but small . in the bistable washboard potential @xmath33 the two subwells exist but are no longer identical as they were in @xmath25 .",
    "a particle of mass @xmath34 moving in a medium of friction coefficient @xmath35 along a potential @xmath24 and driven by an external periodic forcing @xmath36 and subjected to a gaussian white noise @xmath37 , is described here by the langevin equation , @xmath38 the fluctuating forces @xmath37 satisfy : @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the temperature @xmath41 is in units of the boltzmann constant @xmath42 .",

    "we adopt the same numerical procedures as described in ref.@xcite . the drive ( signal )",
    "frequency ( @xmath49 ) is chosen to be close to but a little smaller than the natural frquency at the bottom of the wells of the potentials",
    ". however , they are not exactly equal to the respective natural frequencies ( without damping ) . for the periodic bistable potential @xmath25",
    ", we take the period @xmath50 equal to 4.8 .",
    "the same optimum @xmath50 is taken also for the bistable washboard potential @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , we continue with @xmath51 as in ref.@xcite for the washboard potential @xmath52 .    with the periods @xmath50 of the external forcing @xmath1",
    ", we obtain the trajectories @xmath4 for given initial conditions @xmath7 numerically@xcite by solving the langevin equation ( 2.2 ) and calculate the input energy , or work done by the field on the system , @xmath53 , in a period @xmath50 , as@xcite : @xmath54 where , the effective potential @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , or @xmath33 as applicable . therefore , @xmath57 where @xmath17 is the magnitude of the hla .",
    "the average input energy per period , @xmath58 , averaged over an entire trajectory spanning @xmath59 periods of @xmath3 , is @xmath60 typically , @xmath59 , ranges between @xmath61 to @xmath62 , as required .    at very low temperatures",
    "@xmath58 depends very strongly on the initial conditions ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this is because whether the trajectories are in the in - phase state ( with a small phase difference @xmath63 between @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) or in the out - of - phase state ( with a large phase difference @xmath64 ) is determined by the initial condition . and",
    ", @xmath58 depends on the kind of trajectory .",
    "moreover , at such temperatures the particle remains trapped in the initial well of the potential and also no transition between in - phase and out - of - phase states of trajectories takes place in a well .",
    "however , as the temperature is gradually increased the intra - well transitions between the in - phase and out - of - phase states begin to take place and subsequently , inter - well transitions also become frequent . therefore , as the temperature is increased the dependence of @xmath58 on the initial conditions ( @xmath14 ) weakens .",
    "however , it is always sensible to ensemble average @xmath58 over all possible initial conditions and obtain the average input energy per period @xmath65 , which is also equal to the mean hysteresis loop area @xmath66 , eq .",

    "as mentioned earlier , the response @xmath4 in the two dynamical phases of trajectories not only have different phase relationship with the forcing @xmath3 but the mean amplitude @xmath5 of @xmath4 in the two cases are very different .",
    "therefore , apart from the inherent stochastic nature of @xmath53 ( eq .",

    "as the temperature is increased further the newly formed peaks begin merging with the sole in - phase peak ( for @xmath133 ) and at the temperature @xmath116 the out - of - phase peak is left only as a receding shoulder leaving no distinguishable trace of either a hump or a plateau .",
    "however , in the process the strength of the in - phase @xmath67 peak also diminishes .",

( 3.4 ) . since the amplitude @xmath78 of the external drive @xmath149 ( = 0.2 ) is much smaller than the periodic barrier heights ( @xmath150 ) between two consecutive wells , the amplitude @xmath5 of the average response @xmath69 is small and the relation @xmath151 , with @xmath152 , is found to follow quite well for all three potentials at low temperatures .",
    "however , at higher temperatures the relation serves reasonably well for the potential @xmath52 , and only approximately for @xmath25 and @xmath33 .    the amplitude @xmath5 and phase @xmath153 acquire their respective minima at the temperature @xmath144 of minimum @xmath65 corresponding to the sole dynamical ( in - phase ) state , fig . 13 .",

    "is gradually increased from @xmath155 @xmath5 peaks at @xmath156 .",
    "however , @xmath157 shows a monotonic behaviour . at these temperatures @xmath158 because the trajectories consist of a mixture of in - phase and out - of - phase states .",
    "the variation of @xmath157 is similar to what is reported earlier@xcite and does not show a peak@xcite .",
    "the existence of two dynamical states in a sinusoidally driven ( under)damped system is quite special to periodic potentials . the ( quadratic ) harmonic potentials or the ( quartic ) landau potentials show only one ( in - phase ) state .",
    "the periodic nature of the potentials allows the particle to explore ( in space ) regions of high nonlinearity .",
    "the high nonlinearity of periodic potentials appears to be responsible for the occurrence of these two states ( especially the additional high amplitude out - of - phase state ) in a well in a sinusoidal potential or in a subwell in the bistable periodic or washboard potential .",
    "the investigation of dependence of the existence of two dynamical states on the amplitude of the drive field could also be of interest in periodic potentials .",
    "as observed earlier , the in - phase state in the left subwell of the potential @xmath33 disappears for @xmath110 .",
    "however , if @xmath78 is chosen to be too small the particle may not have the opportunity to explore the highly nonlinear regions of the potential and the out - of - phase trajectories may disappear . therefore , the choice of @xmath78 too is crucial for the study of sr in these potentials .    in the conventional sr it is the bistability of the potential that plays a crucial role . in the present periodic ( or washboard ) potential case sr",
    "is brought about by the bistability ( or multistability ) of the states of trajectories in a well ( subwell ) together with the adjacent wells ( subwells ) of the potential . moreover , if the system is initially prepared in a given well of a double - well potential the conventional sr occurs when the probability distribution of particles becomes equal in both the wells in a finite ( small ) time ( typically , of the order of the period of the drive field ) . in other words ,",
    "the rate of passages across the potential barrier between the two wells becomes equal .",
    "exactly similar is the condition in the periodic potential cases considered in the present work .",
    "the ratio of time spent by the particle in either of the two states of trajectories to the total time reaches 0.5 as the temperature rises to @xmath116 , fig .",
    "12 .    in order to observe sr in the ` periodic ' potentials discussed above it is necessary to choose the period @xmath50 of the drive field judiciously .",
    "sr occurs in a narrow ` window ' of frequency @xmath159 ( @xmath49 ) : approximately , [ @xmath160 for the potential @xmath52 and [ @xmath161 for @xmath25 and [ @xmath162 for the potential @xmath33",

    "@xmath163 is a large temperature and is comparable to the potential barrier @xmath164 between two adjacent wells of the potentials .",
    "consequently , @xmath165 peak becomes broader with increasing @xmath50 .",
    "however , the numerical results for the potentials @xmath25 and @xmath33 are expected to improve if @xmath50 is chosen larger than the value 4.8 . indeed",
    ", the preliminary results show that when @xmath50 is chosen somewhat larger than 4.8 even frequent inter - well transitions could be observed around @xmath116 for the potentials @xmath25 and @xmath33 .",
