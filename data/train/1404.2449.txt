    "the extent to which landau fermi - liquid theory , and its concept of quasiparticles @xcite , applies to the normal state of cuprates is still under debate  @xcite .",
    "evidence for landau fermi - liquid quasiparticles has been reported by resistivity experiments on highly overdoped la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath2 ( lsco )  @xcite .",
    "more recently , unambiguous proof has been given by high - field quantum oscillation experiments  @xcite on both overdoped and underdoped cuprates .",
    "it is , however , puzzling that no evidence of landau fermi - liquid quasiparticle excitations has been found from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , that is a direct probe of the green s function : @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "although the `` quasiparticles '' terminology is widely used to describe the excitations of the photoemission spectra , it has never been proven by arpes that the low - energy excitations in the cuprates are indeed true landau fermi - liquid quasiparticles",
    ". a direct spectroscopic proof of true landau fermi - liquid quasiparticles in the cuprates is therefore important .",
    "this paper has two main objectives .",
    "the first is to prove that the nodal excitations observed in overdoped lsco by arpes are genuine landau fermi - liquid quasiparticles .",
    "the second is to discuss the nodal bare band velocity , @xmath9 , and the nodal quasiparticle residue @xmath10 , where @xmath3 is the self - energy .",
    "perhaps the most compelling spectroscopic proof of landau quasiparticles is the demonstration of a low - energy self - energy that has ( 1 ) the form @xmath11",
    "@xcite and ( 2 ) @xmath12  @xcite . proving this",
    "requires full knowledge about @xmath3 and insight into the bare band @xmath13 , that is not straightforward to derive from an apres spectrum  @xcite . here",
    ", we however present an experimental case where @xmath14 can be evaluated without quantitative knowledge of @xmath13 . in this specific case ,",
    "it is therefore possible to prove the existence of true landau fermi - liquid quasiparticle excitations .         of the momentum distribution curves plotted versus excitation energies squared ( @xmath15 ) , for the two cuts shown in the inset of ( b ) .",

    "nodal arpes spectra of overdoped la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  ( @xmath20k )  @xcite were recorded at the surface and interface spectroscopy ( sis ) beam line  @xcite of the swiss light source ( sls ) at the paul scherrer institute , switzerland .",
    "high quality nodal spectra were obtained after cleaving  @xcite at @xmath21  k under ultra - high vacuum conditions ( @xmath2210@xmath23 mbar ) . using 55 ev circular polarized photons and a scienta 2002 electron analyzer , angular and energy resolutions corresponding to 0.15@xmath24",
    "( fwhm ) and @xmath25  mev ( standard gaussian deviation ) were achieved .",

    "1(c ) . in this energy interval ,",
    "the mdc line shapes are symmetric peaks on a constant background .",
    "therefore , data at constant @xmath17 were analyzed using a lorentzian function @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath16 is the linewidth ( fig .",

    "the half - width half - maximum , @xmath16 , is plotted as a function of excitation energy squared @xmath15 in fig .",
    "we find that , for @xmath32  ev , the linewidth is well described by @xmath33 with @xmath34  ev@xmath35@xmath36 , and @xmath37  @xmath36 .",
    "the elastic scattering @xmath38 is lower than what is usually reported for lsco  @xcite .",
    "as impurity scattering is one source of elastic scattering  @xcite , low values of @xmath38 may be an indication of high sample quality .    to reveal the intrinsic physical line shape",
    ", a background has been subtracted from the edcs shown in fig .",
    "the energy dependent background was extracted from the spectra using an energy distribution curve on the un - occupied side of the dispersion ( indicated by a vertical dashed line in fig .",
    "this is a common procedure  @xcite and an example of a raw background spectrum can be found in the supplement of ref .  .",
    "in this fashion , edcs recorded at a momentum @xmath39 larger than the fermi momentum @xmath40 [ displayed with open circles in fig .",
    "1(c ) ] are featureless , demonstrating the successful background subtraction .",
    "on the other hand , edcs with @xmath41 [ full circles ] reveal the intrinsic line shape of the excitations .",
    "the measured arpes intensities @xmath42 can be modelled by a product of the spectral function @xmath43 , a matrix element @xmath44 , and the fermi distribution @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "matrix elements typically vary weakly as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "notice that the excitations shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) disperse over less than 10 percent of the brillouin zone .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to ignore matrix element effects . in that case",
    ", the arpes intensity becomes a direct measure of the occupied part of the spectral function .",
    "it is common practice to separate the spectral function into coherent and incoherent parts , _",
    "@xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the coherent part can be written as : @xmath47 where @xmath13 is the _ a priori _ unknown bare band , and the self - energy must obey @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , one would associate sharp dispersing features to the coherent part of the spectral function and featureless weight to the incoherent part . here",
    "we focus on the low - energy part of the spectra , where the coherent spectral weight is dominating .    to make progress , two justified assumptions are made .",
    "first , it is assumed that the experimentally unknown bare band can be linearized ( @xmath49 ) near the fermi level .",
    "already the observed normalized band ( extracted from the mdc analysis ) can , to a very good approximation , be described by @xmath50 , with @xmath51  ev  [ fig .",
    "the bare band is expected to have an even larger band velocity  lda calculations suggest for example @xmath52 ev  @xcite .",
    "for the excitation energies discussed here , curvature effects of the bare band are therefore expected to be negligibly small .",
    "secondly , we assume that the self - energy , @xmath3 , is locally momentum independent .",
    "globally this assumption is not correct  the self - energy varies strongly as one approaches the anti - nodal region  @xcite . however , locally , in the vicinity of the nodal region , this is a good approximation .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2 , both the band velocity and mdc linewidth are essentially identical for the two different nodal cuts .",
    "another indication that @xmath3 is momentum independent stems from the symmetric mdc lineshape shown in fig .",
    "1b . a @xmath53-dependence of @xmath3 along the cut - direction would lead to an asymmetric lineshape . as this is not observed ,",
    "it is concluded that @xmath3 is locally independent of momentum both along and perpendicular to the cut direction .",
    "it is thus possible to rewrite the coherent part of the spectral function as : @xmath54 notice that this is nothing else than a lorentzian function in momentum space , with half - width half - maximum @xmath16 given by @xmath55 .",
    "experimentally , it is found that @xmath56 ( see fig .",
    "therefore , consistently with true fermi liquid quasiparticle excitations , we conclude that @xmath57 .",
    "a kramers - kronig consistent self - energy with @xmath58 has @xmath59 in the low - energy limit .",
    "the unknown constant @xmath60 is sometimes referred to as the quasiparticle renormalization factor  @xcite . if consistency between mdc and edc poles ( dispersions ) is enforced , then @xmath61 .",
    "the coherent spectral function can consequently be re - written as : @xmath62 where both @xmath63 and @xmath16 are known from the mdc analysis .",
    "the only unknown parameter , @xmath9 , is a prefactor .",
    "it is therefore possible to model the edc lineshape without quantitative knowledge of the bare band @xmath64 , and with the peak amplitude as the only free parameter  see solid lines in fig .",
    "1(c ) . in the displayed energy interval",
    ", a consistent description of both edcs and mdcs were obtained from @xmath65 .    because @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the product @xmath68 can be evaluated without quantitative knowledge of the bare band velocity .",
    "the condition for coherent quasiparticle excitations is @xmath69  @xcite . using the experimental values of @xmath63 and @xmath70",
    ", we find that landau quasiparticles are coherent for @xmath71  ev .",
    "this energy scale is comparable to @xmath18  the energy scale below which @xmath58  and hence re - enforces the interpretation of @xmath18 as an energy scale related to the break down of landau fermi - liquid quasiparticle excitations  @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the kramers - kronig relation between @xmath72 and @xmath73 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the principal value and @xmath76 is the band width . to first order ,",
    "the quasiparticle part yields @xmath77 where @xmath78 . to gain insight into @xmath79 ,",
    "we define @xmath80 so that @xmath81 . as @xmath82 varies weakly with excitation energies ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , we infer that @xmath83 ( to first order ) is @xmath17-independent .",
    "hence @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "as long as the detailed high - energy part of @xmath86 is unknown , it is not possible to directly extract @xmath87 .",
    "this is known as the `` tail '' problem  @xcite .",
    "the linear @xmath17-dependence at high - energies , shown in the inset of fig .",
    "2 , yields @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an unknown constant . hence @xmath90 diverges only logaritmically in the limit @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for large @xmath18 the role of @xmath90 will be less important . as @xmath92  ev is a large energy scale , corresponding to a temperature scale of the order 1000 k",
    ", we hypothesize that @xmath93 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath94 and hence @xmath95   .",
    "this is consistent with the nodal lda fermi velocity @xmath96  ev  @xcite calculated for lsco and with values of @xmath9 derived from a numeric self - consistent method  @xcite .",
    "the consistent values of @xmath9 further support the conjecture that @xmath93 .",
    ", in arbitrary units , versus excitation energy @xmath17 fot the two cuts in the inset of fig .",
    "correction by the fermi - dirac distribution only influence the data points near the fermi level.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the quasiparticle mass is given by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the bare mass and @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "since the self - energy is locally independent of momentum , the nodal quasiparticle mass is given by @xmath100 .",
    "this is comparable to the momentum averaged values @xmath101 extracted from quantum oscillation  @xcite and electronic specific heat experiments on overdoped tl@xmath4ba@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( tl2201 )  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , a fermi - liquid cut - off energy scale @xmath102  ev was extracted  @xcite from angle - dependent magneto - resistance measurements on overdoped tl2201  @xcite .",
    "this is in good agreement with nodal arpes spectra recorded on lsco @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "on lsco , no quantum oscillation or angle - dependent magneto - resistance experiments exist .",
    "insight into the average quasiparticle mass of overdoped lsco stems , therefore , alone from specific heat measurements  @xcite . compared to tl2201  @xcite , a somewhat larger sommerfeld constant @xmath103  mj/(mole k@xmath104 ) is found for overdoped lsco @xmath105  @xcite , suggesting a larger average quasiparticle mass .",
    "this is not necessarily inconsistent with the arpes data .",
    "the fermi - liquid cut - off energy scale , @xmath18 , softens rapidly as a function of fermi surface angle , and the quasiparticle scattering is globally dependent on momentum  @xcite .",
    "this implies ( 1 ) that the contribution from non - fermi liquid excitations will become increasingly important and ( 2 ) that @xmath106 on certain portions of the fermi surface .",
    "both effects would lead to larger quasiparticle masses .",
    "in summary , we have proven that the nodal single particle excitations observed by arpes in overdoped lsco are indeed true landau fermi liquid quasiparticle excitations . this result , together with consistent mdc and edc analysis , was obtained without knowing the exact bare band . from kramers - kronig consistency of the quasiparticle self - energy @xmath3 , insight into the bare band @xmath64 and the real part of the self - energy @xmath72 were obtained .",
    "an estimate of the nodal quasiparticle residue @xmath107 allowed comparison to quasiparticle masses obtained from thermodynamic and high - field quantum oscillation experiments on overdoped tl@xmath4ba@xmath4cuo@xmath5 compounds  @xcite .",
