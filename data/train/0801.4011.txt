    "over the past decade or so , the field of ultracold gases has seen tremendous breakthroughs . after reaching degeneracy in bose  @xcite and fermi  @xcite gases , the realization of an atom laser  @xcite , of the mott - insulator transition  @xcite , and of the conversion from an atomic to a molecular gas  @xcite followed .",
    "many of the present - day studies take advantage of the tunability of the atom - atom scattering length in the vicinity of a so - called fano - feshbach resonance  @xcite . as an external magnetic field",
    "is tuned through its resonance value , the sign of the scattering length changes  @xcite .",
    "exactly on resonance , the scattering length is infinitely large , allowing for the study of strongly - correlated systems .",
    "experimentally , the speed of the magnetic field ramp can be changed , allowing adiabatic ramps , for example , and the ramp itself can be reversed .",
    "it is this versatility that made possible the experimental study of the bcs - bec crossover , using ultracold atomic fermi gases trapped in two different hyperfine states  @xcite .    using present - day technology , the realization of degenerate multi - component atomic fermi gases appears possible in principle .",
    "the occupation of more than two different hyperfine states of the same species requires , neglecting for the moment possible losses , only moderate changes of current set - ups .",
    "a particularly promising candidate appears to be @xmath1li  @xcite , and the coexistence of three hyperfine states has already been demonstrated for @xmath2k  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a number of goups are presently pursuing the simultaneous trapping of three different atomic species  @xcite . in the former scenario ,",
    "the atomic masses of all components are equal , whereas in the latter scenario , the atomic masses of the different components differ . in either of these realizations of multi - component fermi gases , all or some of the interspecies scattering lengths may be tunable thanks to the possible existence of magnetic or optical fano - feshbach resonances .",
    "this may open the possibility to experimentally investigate the stability and to study , provided an extended stable regime exists , the behaviors of multi - component fermi gases as a function of the @xmath0-wave scatterig length .    using two different theoretical frameworks",
    ", this paper considers three- and four - component fermi gases , and compares their behaviors with those of two - component fermi gases .",
    "in particular , we ask how the stability of two - component fermi gases changes when a third or fourth component are added .",
    "it is now well established that trapped two - component fermi gases are stable even when the interspecies @xmath0-wave scattering length is negative and its magnitude is infinitely large  @xcite .",
    "the stability of inhomogeneous as well as of homogeneous two - component fermi gases with attractive short - range interactions and arbitrary interspecies scattering length can be attributed to the pauli exclusion principle ( also referred to as fermi pressure ) , which introduces effective repulsive intraspecies interactions that more than compensate the attractive interspecies interactions .",
    "in contrast , homogeneous bose gases with negative scattering lengths are unstable ; they can , however , be stabilized by an external confining potential as long as the product of the number of bosons and the @xmath0-wave scattering length is less negative than a certain critical value  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec_system ] introduces the hamiltonian of trapped multi - component fermi gases as well as a simple `` counting argument '' that turns out to be quite useful in understanding the stability of multi - component fermi gases .",
    "section  [ sec_hyper ] investigates the stability of three- and four - component equal - mass fermi gases within a hyperspherical framework , focussing on the large and small particle number limits .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath3 for an atomic fermi gas with @xmath4 components under external spherically symmetric harmonic confinement is given by @xmath5 here , the number of atoms of the @xmath6th component is denoted by @xmath7 , and the total number of atoms is given by @xmath8 , @xmath9 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq_ham ] ) , @xmath10 denotes the position vector of the @xmath11th atom of the @xmath6th component , measured with respect to the center of the trap , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively the atomic mass and the angular frequency of the @xmath6th component .",
    "the potential @xmath14 describes the interaction between an atom of the @xmath6th and an atom of the @xmath15th component .",
    "this work considers a zero - range potential ( see towards the end of this section and sec .",
    "[ sec_hyper ] ) and a purely attractive short - range potential ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_mc ] ) . in both cases , we characterize the strengths of the @xmath14 by the @xmath0-wave scattering lengths @xmath16 . we assume that the two - body interactions are independent of spin , implying that the number of atoms in each spin state is conserved . throughout this work ,",

    "we first consider the case where all @xmath12 , all @xmath13 , all @xmath7 , and all @xmath16 ( @xmath22 ) are equal .",
    "a four - component gas of this type could , e.g. , be realized by equally populating and trapping the four spin states of a fermionic atom whose ground state has vanishing total electronic angular momentum @xmath23 but a non - vanishing nuclear spin @xmath24 of @xmath25 . in this case",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this paper investigates the stability of trapped @xmath4-component fermi gases interacting through short - range two - body potentials with negative scattering lengths .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] summarizes the results of our stability analysis .",
    "one of our main findings is that trapped multi - component fermi gases with more than two components , in which all scattering lengths , masses and trapping frequencies are equal , become unstable for a certain critical negative scattering length .",
    "this instability , a type of ferminova , is similar to the instability of trapped bose gases with negative scattering length , sometimes referred to as bosenova  @xcite .",
    "the instability predicted here for multi - component fermi systems , @xmath33 , emerges within two different theoretical frameworks : a hyperspherical many - body treatment that employs either the bare or a density - dependent zero - range interaction  @xcite , and a many - body monte carlo treatment , which includes both vmc and fn - dmc calculation and employs finite - range two - body interactions with a range @xmath34 chosen so that the first three - particle state with negative energy appears for @xmath35 much less negative than @xmath36 .",
    "both the hyperspherical and the monte carlo frameworks parameterize the nodal surface of the anti - symmetric many - body wave function by the ideal gas nodal surface . in the limit of vanishing confinement and periodic boundary conditions",
    ", this corresponds to a wave function that describes a normal state .",
    "this paper does not investigate wave functions that include pairing physics or the possibility of phase separation from the outset . for three - component systems , for instance , a bcs mean - field framework predicts the existence of a pairing mechanism in which the atoms of species one and two pair ( forming a superfluid ) while the atoms of species three are in a normal state  @xcite .",
    "this pairing mechanism has also been investigated within other theoretical frameworks  @xcite .",
    "although the parameter combinations considered in the above cited references is different from those considered in the present paper , we believe that future monte carlo studies of multi - component fermi gases with more than two components should investigate the implications of a many - body wave function that has pairing physics build in from the outset .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to address the question whether a state that contains pairing physics would be stable against the collapse investigated in the present study .",
    "if such a stabilizing mechanism existed this would have important consequences for on - going cold atom experiments .    to observe the predicted collapse of multi - component fermi gases with all - resonant interactions , we imagine the following experiment .",
    "first , a stable @xmath4-component fermi gas ( @xmath37 ) with vanishing interspecies scattering lengths is prepared .",
    "we then imagine that all interspecies scattering lengths be suddenly tuned to the same large negative value .",
    "the time scale for this ramp should be fast compared to the time scale at which phase separation might occur and also fast compared to the time scale at which losses due to spin - flip collisions might occur .",
    "the attraction between particles would then produce an implosion and collapse of the system .",
    "following the implosion , we anticipate that recombination into molecules and clusters will immediately follow once the system reaches high density , and the resulting energy release should detonate a ferminova akin to the bosenova that has been observed experimentally and discussed theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the rich dynamics of soliton formation , akin to that observed for bosonic atoms in ref .",
    "@xcite could also conceivably ensue .    a second main finding of our work concerns three - component fermi systems with two resonant and one non - resonant interspecies scattering lengths .",
    "the behavior of these systems depends strongly on the range @xmath34 of the underlying two - body potential . for very small",
    "@xmath34 , an instability similar to that for the three - component system with all - resonant interactions appears to arise , although at much more negative @xmath35 . for larger @xmath34",
    ", the many - body system may be made up of weakly - bound trimers and may be stable all the way up to unitarity .",
    "we note that the importance of the range parameter , or a three - body parameter , was already pointed out in earlier work  @xcite .",
    "future studies should investigate in more detail whether a fermi system consisting of weakly- or strongly - bound trimers could be realized experimentally .",
    "finally , we note that multi - component fermi gases have recently also been investigated in one - dimensional space  @xcite .",
    "assuming zero - range interactions , many properties of the multi - component system can be obtained analytically through the exact bethe ansatz . for negative coupling constant ,",
    "the ground state of @xmath4-component fermi gases contains clusters that consist of @xmath4-atoms ( one of each species ) .",
    "it is suggested that one - dimensional three - component fermi gases undergo a phase transition that is analogous to the quark color superconductor state  @xcite . in the future , it would be interesting to investigate whether such a transition also exists in three - dimensional three - component fermi gases .",
    "clearly , more work is needed to better understand the behavior of three - dimensional multi - component fermi gases , including the implications of different two - body ranges and different nodal surfaces of the guiding function employed in the monte carlo study .",
    "this work investigated the behavior of multi - component fermi gases for different scattering lengths and two - body ranges . in cases where three - body states with negative energy exist",
    ", it will be important to determine if the range of the two - body parameter is indeed the relavant parameter ; it may be that the trimer binding energy is a more natural quantity ."
