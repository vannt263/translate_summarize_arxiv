    "the profound connection between gravity and thermodynamics has a long history since the discovery of black holes thermodynamics in 1970 s @xcite .",
    "it was discovered that black holes can emit hawking radiation with a temperature proportional to its surface gravity at the black hole horizon and black hole has an entropy proportional to its horizon area @xcite .",
    "the hawking temperature and horizon entropy together with the black hole mass obey the first law of black hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the studies on the connection between gravity and thermodynamics has been continued until in 1995 jacobson showed that the einstein field equation is just an equation of state for spacetime and in particular it can be derived from the the first law of thermodynamics together with relation between the horizon area and entropy @xcite . following jacobson , however",
    ", several recent investigations have shown that there is indeed a deeper connection between gravitational dynamics and horizon thermodynamics .",
    "it has been shown that the gravitational field equations in a wide variety of theories , when evaluated on a horizon , reduce to the first law of thermodynamics and vice versa .",
    "this result , first pointed out in @xcite , has now been demonstrated in various theory including f(r ) gravity @xcite , cosmological setups @xcite , and in braneworld scenarios @xcite .",
    "for a recent review on the thermodynamical aspects of gravity and complete list of references see @xcite .",
    "although jacobson s derivation is logically clear and theoretically sound , the statistical mechanical origin of the thermodynamic nature of gravity remains obscure .    a constructive new idea on the relation between gravity and thermodynamics",
    "was recently proposed by verlinde @xcite who claimed that gravity is not a fundamental interaction and can be interpreted as an entropic force arising from the change of information when a material body moves away from the holographic screen .",
    "verlinde postulated that when a test particle approaches a holographic screen from a distance @xmath2 , the magnitude of the entropic force on this body has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the temperature and the entropy change on the screen , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ rec ] ) .    focusing on the physical explanation of interesting proposal of verlinde",
    ", it has been shown that his idea is problematic @xcite .",
    "in other word , although verlinde s derivation is right , mathematically , it does not prove that gravity is an entropic force , physically .",
    "we should note that it has been presented a general objection to viewing gravity as an entropic force @xcite and it has been proved that verlinde s idea is supported by a mathematical argument based on a discrete group theory @xcite .",
    "in addition , considering a modified entropic force with the covariant entropy bound , one may obtain the newtonian force law @xcite . also , following the controversial hypothesis in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that gravity is an entropic force .",
    "verlinde s derivation of laws of gravitation opens a new window to understand gravity from the first principles .",
    "the entropic interpretation of gravity has been used to extract friedmann equations at the apparent horizon of the friedmann - robertson - walker universe @xcite , modified friedmann equations @xcite , modified newton s law modesto , the newtonian gravity in loop quantum gravity @xcite , the holographic dark energy @xcite , thermodynamics of black holes @xcite and the extension to coulomb force @xcite .",
    "other studies on the entropic force have been carried out in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the derivation of newton s law of gravity , in verlinde s approach , depends on the entropy - area relationship @xmath6 of black holes in einstein s gravity , where @xmath7 represents the area of the horizon and @xmath8 is the planck length .",
    "however , this definition can be modified from the inclusion of quantum effects .",
    "two well - known quantum corrections to the area law have been introduced in the literatures , namely , logarithmic and power - law corrections .",
    "logarithmic corrections , arises from loop quantum gravity due to thermal equilibrium fluctuations and quantum fluctuations @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are dimensionless constants of order unity .",
    "the exact values of these constants are not yet determined and still an open issue in quantum gravity .",
    "power - law correction appears in dealing with the entanglement of quantum fields in and out the horizon .",
    "the entanglement entropy of the ground state obeys the bekenstein- hawking area law . however , a correction term proportional to a fractional power of area results when the field is in a superposition of ground and excited states @xcite .",
    "in other words , the excited state contributes to the power - law correction , and more excitations produce more deviation from the area law @xcite .",
    "the power - law corrected entropy is written as @xcite @xmath12 \\label{plec}\\]]where @xmath13 is a dimensionless constant whose value ranges as @xmath14 @xcite , and @xmath15where @xmath16 is the crossover scale . the second term in eq . ( [ plec ] )",
    "can be regarded as a power - law correction to the area law , resulting from entanglement , when the wave - function of the field is chosen to be a superposition of ground state and exited state @xcite .",
    "taking the corrected entropy - area relation into account , the corrections to the newton s law of gravitation as well as the modified friedman equations were derived @xcite .    in this paper , we would like to extend the study to the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "we will derive the general quantum corrections to the coulomb s law , poisson s equation and the general form of the modified newton - coulomb s law by assuming the entropic origin for the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "in order to derive the corrections to the coulomb s law of electromagnetic , we consider the modified entropy - area relationship in the following form @xmath17where @xmath18 represents the general quantum correction terms in the entropy expression .",
    "we assume there are two charged particles , one a test charged particle with mass @xmath19 and charge @xmath20 and the other considered as the source with respective charge @xmath21 and mass @xmath22 located at the center ( see fig .",
    "[ spherical ] for more details ) . centered around the source mass @xmath22 with charge @xmath21 , is a spherically symmetric surface @xmath23 which will be defined with certain properties that will be specified explicitly later . to derive the entropic law",
    ", the surface @xmath24 is between the test mass and the source mass , but the test mass is assumed to be very close to the surface as compared to its reduced compton wavelength @xmath25 . when a test mass @xmath19 is a distance @xmath26 away from the surface @xmath27 , the entropy of the surface changes by one fundamental unit @xmath5 fixed by the discrete spectrum of the area of the surface via the relation @xmath28    we find out that in order to interpret the entropic origin for the electromagnetic force , we should leave away the relativistic rest mass energy @xmath29 , and instead , in a similar manner , we propose the relativistic rest electromagnetic energy of the source @xmath21 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is a constant with known dimension ( @xmath33=\\frac{[k]}{[g]}$ ] , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are coulomb and newtonian constants , respectively ) .",
    "although the physical interpretation of assumption ( [ ec ] ) is not clear well yet for us , however as we will see it leads to the reasonable results .",
    "it is notable to mention that the charge / mass ratio ( @xmath36 ) is a physical quantity that is widely used in the electrodynamics of charged particles .",
    "when a charged particle follows a circular which is caused by the magnetic field , the magnetic force is acting like a centripetal force .",
    "it is easy to find that charge / mass ratio ( @xmath37 ) is a constant in which we equal it to @xmath38 .",
    "considering the relativistic rest mass energy relation with the motivation of analogy between mass in gravity and charge in electromagnetic interactions , one may consider @xmath39 , in which @xmath40 is the electromagnetic energy and @xmath41 is its corresponding mass which we call it as the electromagnetic mass .",
    "it is notable that there are other concepts of mass in special relativity , such as longitudinal mass and transverse mass",
    ".    we should mention that we are working in the geometrized unit of charge , in which the coulomb s law takes almost the same form as the newton s law except for the difference in signature . on the surface @xmath23",
    ", there live a set of bytes \" of information that scale proportional to the area of the surface so that @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the number of bytes and @xmath44 is a fundamental constant which should be determined later .",
    "assuming the temperature on the surface is @xmath4 , and then according to the equipartition law of energy @xcite , the total energy on the surface is @xmath45 finally , we assume that the electric force on the charge particle @xmath20 follows from the generic form of the entropic force governed by the thermodynamic equation of state @xmath46 where @xmath5 is one fundamental unit of entropy when @xmath47 , and the entropy gradient points radially from the outside of the surface to inside .",
    "note that @xmath43 is the number of bytes and thus @xmath48 ; hence from ( [ aqn ] ) we find @xmath49 .",
    "now , we are in a position to derive the entropy - corrected coulomb s law . combining eqs .",
    "( [ s3])- ( [ f2 ] ) , we reach @xmath50 _ { a=4\\pi r^{2 } } ,   \\label{f3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is nothing but the coulomb s law of electromagnetic to the first order provided we define @xmath51 and @xmath52 . thus we write the general quantum corrected coulomb s law as @xmath53 _",
    "{ a=4\\pi r^{2}}.   \\label{f4}\\ ] ] in order to specify the correction terms explicitly , we use the two well - known kinds of entropy corrections .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath54 ,   \\label{f5}\\ ] ] @xmath55 ,   \\label{f55}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are , respectively , the logarithmic and power - law corrected coulomb s law .",
    "thus , with the corrections in the entropy expression , we see that the coulomb s law will be modified accordingly . since the correction terms in eqs .",
    "( [ f5 ] ) and ( [ f55 ] ) can be comparable to the first term only when @xmath58 is very small ( i.e. @xmath59 and @xmath60 for eqs .",
    "( [ f5 ] ) and ( [ f55 ] ) , respectively ) , the corrections make sense only at the very small distances ( note that @xmath61 ) . for large distances ( i.e. @xmath62 for ( [ f5 ] ) and @xmath63 for ( [ f55 ] ) )",
    ", the entropy - corrected coulomb s law reduces to the usual coulomb s law of electromagnetic .",
    "in order to compare the entropic correction with qed correction of coulomb s law , we introduce the the so called uehling potential @xcite as a radiative correction to coulomb potential in @xmath0-loop order ( the vacuum - polarization correction for an electron in a nuclear coulomb field ) . using the born approximation , the relation between the scattering amplitude @xmath22 and the potential is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) are the momenta and energy of the incoming ( outgoing ) particles , respectively , and @xmath69 .",
    "for ordinary qed , the amplitude of a particle - antiparticle scattering is given by @xcite @xmath70 comparing ( [ i m ] ) with ( [ ampl ] ) , one can show that the attractive classical coulomb potential @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 . using a fourier transformation into the coordinate space",
    ", one can find @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the fine structure constant .",

    "we draw three logarithmic figures for different scale .",
    "figure [ figs ] , which is drawn for very small scale ( @xmath84 ) , shows that for small value of @xmath58 , @xmath85 is compatible with @xmath86 and for a special value of @xmath58 they are equal , and also @xmath87 is near to the coloumb force , @xmath88 . when we investigate the figure [ figm ] , which is drawn for medium scale ( @xmath89 ) , we find that in this scale , @xmath85 is far from others .",
    "one can find that in figure [ figl ] , which is plotted for large scale ( @xmath90 ) , @xmath87 , @xmath86 and @xmath88 are overlapped to each other and @xmath85 is separated .",
    "these figures show that for small values of distance @xmath85 is more compatible with uehling force , but for large values of @xmath58 , @xmath87 is more near to @xmath86 . as a result",
    "it is interesting to study the entropic force arising from the change of information .",
    "in this section we would like to generalize our discussion in the previous section to the case where electromagnetic force as well as the gravitational force are considered .",
    "we will study two approaches in dealing with the problem .      in the first approach we identify the total relativistic rest energy as @xmath91and thus the equipartition rule ( [ ec ] ) will be replaced with @xmath92inserting eqs .",

    "we see that the correction terms have the same form for both gravitation and electromagnetic forces .",
    "if one of the particle does not have charge , i.e. @xmath98 or @xmath99 , then eq . ( [ fm&q2 ] ) reduces to the quantum correction newton s law of gravitation @xcite .",
