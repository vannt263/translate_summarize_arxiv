    "in this paper we concentrate on a description of the deuteron using our collective hamiltonian .",

    "we shall also exhibit the dependence on the choice of parameters in the skyrme model , and shall argue that the result of manton and collaborators was accidental , and that the best one can hope for is an energy not too far from zero , maybe with an error of 30 mev or so .    after having analysed the deuteron in great detail",
    "we turn our attention to the triton and @xmath1he .",
    "a while ago , carlson @xcite has studied the application of the skyrme model to the system of three baryons ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite where the @xmath2 system is studied using the approximate yang - mills instanton - induced ( ymi - induced ) form for the skyrme fields ) . in these studies",
    "one starts from the minimum energy solution where the baryon density has tetrahedral symmetry ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bdens]a ) .",
    "one then makes the approximation that this minimum describes the triton .",
    "this approximation leads to a tremendous over - binding , which was attributed to the neglect of simple quantum effects , especially vibrational zero - point motion .",
    "it has also been mentioned @xcite that anharmonic modes might play a rle .    in this paper",
    "we show that the low - energy potential `` landscape '' has a lot of structure , which has both important qualitative and quantitative effects",
    ". the most salient features in this landscape , apart from the tetrahedral solutions , are two meta - stable states at slightly higher energy , the @xmath2 doughnut and the `` pretzel '' which has a planar symmetry similar to the doughnut but has two holes ( see figs .",

    "the approach taken is this work is based on the techniques discussed in great detail in ref .",

    "this is based on a mode - following approach , where we start from the harmonic fluctuations around a stable solution , and follow those into the anharmonic regime .",
    "one advantage of our approach is that such anharmonic modes always run through the extrema of the potential energy .",
    "the main limitation of the current work is the use of the instanton induced form of the skyrme fields , see also ref .",

    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the `` standard '' skyrme model is based on the non - linear sigma model , extended by a quartic interaction term and a pion mass term .",
    "the instanton - induced form @xcite of the skyrme fields can only be used in the ( chiral ) limit of zero pion mass , where the model is defined by the lagrange density @xmath5 [ u^{\\dagger}\\partial^{\\mu}u , u^{\\dagger}\\partial^{\\nu}u ] , \\label{eq : lagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a unitary two - by - two matrix - valued field satisfying the boundary condition @xmath7 at infinity . as has been discussed many times before ,",

    "it is convenient to parametrise @xmath19 for the jackiw - nohl - rebbi ( jnr ) instanton of charge @xmath20 we have @xcite @xmath21 and we should use @xmath22 , to obtain a field of positive baryon number @xmath20 .    in order to solve for the ymi - induced value of @xmath6 we convert the integral ( [ eq : holonomy ] ) to the solution of a differential equation .",

    "the field @xmath6 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : holonomy ] ) does not have an explicit time dependence .",
    "there is an implicit dependence , due to a possible variation of the instanton parameters as well as the unitary matrix @xmath18 ( parametrised by the three angles @xmath36 ) with time .",
    "let us denote the parameters @xmath37 collectively by @xmath38 .",

    "this also means that we have broken the lorentz invariance of the original equations , so that ( [ eq : leff ] ) can only be used to describe adiabatic ( small velocity ) motion .    in the ymi - induced ansatz",
    "we have thus replaced the general matrix @xmath43 , with an infinite number of parameters , by a form parametrised by @xmath44 parameters , @xmath45 .",
    ".different parameter sets as used in the skyrme model [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us first consider the paths connecting the different solutions .",
    "as we stated there is a path connecting the two independent tetrahedral configurations through a saddle point that looks like a doughnut .",
    "actually there are three such paths , corresponding to the three `` independent '' doughnuts with rotational symmetry around each of the three coordinate axes .",
    "such a path is very similar to the geodesic with twisted symmetry found in the scattering of three collinear monopoles by houghton and sutcliffe @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to motion where the skyrmion breaks apart into three @xmath3 hedgehogs in an attractive ( and therefore twisted ) configuration .",
    "the only thing is that in our case the skyrmion does not go into into this form , but rather breaks up into two @xmath46 `` bananas '' as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twist ] . since solutions with fractional baryon number do not exist in the skyrme model",
    "they have infinite energy  this leads to an infinite energy in the limit of infinite separation .",
    "it is plausible that the use of the jnr instanton , instead of the full ahdm data is responsible for this effect  it is hard to imagine how to describe the desired configuration in terms of the jnr data . for the motion _ in between _ the doughnut and hedgehog the jnr form appears to be reasonable .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : corel_dn ] we show how the local harmonic frequencies change as we move from the doughnut to the tetrahedron and beyond . as usual",
    "we have fixed the normalisation of the coordinate @xmath47 by requiring that the mass ( which we usually call @xmath48 ) equals one .",
    "there are no major exciting structures along the path , and one can see that the mode we followed ( denoted by the triangles ) interpolates smoothly between the tetrahedron and doughnut .",
    "furthermore we find that several modes are doubly degenerate for all @xmath47 due to the symmetry in the configurations along the path . in this case ignoring the weights in the jnr instanton",
    "is no limitation ; they are constant and all equal for all points along the path .",
    "the potential energy along the path is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_dn ] .",
    "once one has the doughnut , one can study its unstable modes .",
    "it has two ,",
    "the one discussed above , and one leading to the pretzel . this latter solution is described by a rhombic arrangement of the poles , so that for each doughnut we have two neighbouring pretzels , obtained by compressing any of the two diagonals of the square arrangements of poles describing the doughnut . in this case",
    "the weights in the jnr potential are also no longer equal , but this need not concern us here .",
    "the pretzel has one unstable mode , which connects to the tetrahedron , as we discovered through our mode following approach .",
    "a very important property of the path between the tetrahedron and the pretzel is that at all points the skyrme fields have a trivial reflection symmetry under coordinate reflections , namely @xmath49 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : corel_pr ] we show how the local harmonic frequencies change as we move from the pretzel to the tetrahedron .",
    "actually we find that at the tetrahedron the mode followed ( again denoted by squares ) connects to the lowest triplet of modes in the doughnut .",
    "since each of the modes of the triplet describes a circuit through two pretzels and another tetrahedron , as denoted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : lands ] .",
    "note that the lowest mode for the tetrahedron is the one connecting to the doughnut , which is the higher of the two saddle points .",
    "obviously this figure only sketches one out of three connections , the whole structure of the collective manifold being highly complex .",
    "as in the case of the @xmath4 system , the most straightforward way to get a `` quantum '' result for @xmath2 is to quantise in harmonic approximation . near the tetrahedron the collective hamiltonian leads to an expression for the energy of the following form @xmath50    the ground state has intrinsic quantum numbers @xmath51 . replacing the inner product of @xmath52 and @xmath53 with the square of the grand - spin operator @xmath54",
    ", we find the following energy balance : @xmath55 for our three sets of parameters this takes on the values @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 mev . here",
    "we once again see the effect of the over - estimate of quantum corrections .",
    "notice that without these corrections the value would be @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 mev , respectively .",
    "since we expect anharmonicities to play a large rle , we shall now study the effect of large amplitude fluctuations .",
    "as a fast and relatively simple way to study the modes one can assume that one can independently quantise the motion along the straight line and the ellipse , since these represent orthogonal modes at the tetrahedron .",
    "we first look at the paths through the doughnut . we have constructed a simple model , based on the vsepr model @xcite , as has been used in the chemistry of molecules .",
    "it is based on putting particles on a sphere , and letting them interact through a pairwise repulsive interaction , which is taken to be some power of the inverse of the separation of the particles .",
    "if we do that in our problem we should constrain the jnr poles on a sphere .",
    "the minimal energy configuration will be a tetrahedron , and there will be a saddle point at the a square configuration of poles , corresponding to the doughnut .",
    "the configuration space is an eight - dimensional manifold .",
    "three of those are the rotational zero modes . at the tetrahedron",
    "the remaining modes are a pair of degenerate modes describing the motion towards the squares and three further - non - zero modes .",
    "these last three are of no interest , but can be eliminated by imposing the additional constraint that the distance between two pairs of points is equal , and that the line connecting the two mid - points of each pair goes through the centre of the sphere .    with these constraints , using the coordinates specified in fig .",
    "[ fig : model1 ] , we obtain @xmath62 ( here @xmath63 is a rigid body - rotation corresponding to the three zero - modes ) . from this",
    "we can calculate the classical lagrangian , @xmath64 a lot of insight can be gained by plotting the potential as a function of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the kinetic energy is proportional to @xmath67 , which allows the interpretation of the configuration space as a sphere . in order to plot the potential on this sphere ,",
    "we have colour - coded the values of @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot1 ] one can see this potential .",
    "we have also indicated the tunnelling paths from one minimum to the next . here",
    "one can see why we have only two independent modes , and not three : one can not have three _ orthogonal _ paths in two dimensions .",
    "one has to be somewhat careful how to interpret this sphere .",
    "in essence there are only two independent orientations of the tetrahedron ( the minimum ) , which are related through an element of the octahedral group that is not in the tetrahedral group . a sketch of that is given if fig .",
    "[ fig : quasi_rot ] .",
    "as can be seen there , adjacent vertices have independent tetrahedra , whereas all next - to - nearest neighbours correspond to the same tetrahedron and a relabelling of the poles .",
    "this relabelling does nothing for the skyrme fields , and we are thus forced to identify these configurations as the same point .",
    "this tetrahedral invariance means that the quantum mechanics is actually restricted to a quarter of the sphere , with slightly complex boundary conditions .",
    "the potential energy has an even higher symmetry , however .",
    "its fundamental domain , 1/24th of the sphere , is mapped onto the whole sphere by the @xmath69 group .",
    "qualitatively one would expect that the lowest state has maximal symmetry .",
    "this is realized if we make a symmetric combination of individual wave functions located in each minimum , leading to a cubic arrangement of wave functions .",
    "note that this is not directly related to the pole positions ; each minimum corresponds to a different tetrahedron .",
    "they can be arranged in two groups of four . within each group",
    "the tetrahedra are related by a permutation of the poles ( or an element of the tetrahedral group ) .",
    "the two groups are related by a @xmath70 rotation , an element of the octahedral group .",
    "since the pion field transforms non - trivial under all these transformations , we end up with a configuration explicitly symmetrised with respect to the full octahedral group .",
    "the tunnelling to the pretzel is somewhat harder to describe in the same terms , but that may not be necessary .",
    "we find that there are three  periodic  paths that describe tunnelling possibilities from one tetrahedron to one that is related by a reflection in a plane through the centre of the tetrahedron and parallel to two of the edges ( an element of the octahedral and not of the tetrahedral group ) .",
    "since these have a saddle point at lower energy than the paths through the doughnuts , one expects that they are even more important than those solutions .",
    "in essence these paths can be visualised as the edges of a cube , where each closed path is equivalent to one edge .    if we label the different edges of the cube as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cube ] we can estimate the spectrum using a simple hckel model , where we only include the nearest - neighbour interaction diagonalising a simple 8-by-8 hamiltonian matrix @xmath71 where we assume all the eight configurations to be orthogonal .",
    "@xmath72 is an estimate for the binding energy within a single well , and @xmath73 is a mixing matrix element ( whose sign will be positive ) . since we have to identify even and odd tetrahedra , the only two eigenvectors of this matrix allowed are the symmetric and antisymmetric ones .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath74 , and @xmath75 has eigenvector @xmath76 .    since this concerns a lower barrier , it is of greatest relevance to the large amplitude motion .",
    "the major issue here is that the harmonic oscillator length parameter for each of the wells is comparable to the length of the circuit for any reasonable value of skyrme - model parameters . in this case",
    "the wave function in the circuit becomes approximately constant , and the energy is the average of the potential along the circuit . since the contribution of the rotational kinetic energy tends to flatten the potential even more , fig .",
    "[ fig : rot_pr ] , this only reinforces this behaviour . if we just naively solve the one - dimensional problem on the circle , we find an energy of @xmath77 , a considerable rise in energy .",
    "furthermore , since the pretzel is a lot bigger than the tetrahedron , we find an enhanced value for the r.m.s .",
    "radius ( by about @xmath78 ) .",
    "for the paths through the doughnut we can not readily make such an estimate .",
    "even though the harmonic oscillator length parameter is again close to the length of the path , which would imply a similar estimate as above , we can not ignore the two - dimensional nature of the problem here .",
    "if we return to our vsepr model , the simplest symmetric wave function , that has zeros at the infinities of the potential is @xmath79 ( it is easier to write the wave function in terms of cartesian tensors than as spherical harmonics ) . that wave function , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfs]a , carries non - zero kinetic energy , and a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath80 if we make the wave function more strongly centred along the tunnelling paths , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : wfs]b , the expectation value of @xmath54 increases ( to @xmath81 for this example ) .",
    "the best possible estimate for the contribution to the ground state energy from the two lowest modes is @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the radius of the sphere associated with a tunnelling path of length @xmath12 , @xmath84 .",
    "the integral is along one of the tunnelling paths .",
    "there are many objections one can make to this approximation ( the real collective surface is not exactly a sphere , we ignore the zero - point motion orthogonal to the path , etc . ) but we have been unable to come up with a reasonable alternative .",
    "we estimate that @xmath85 , and calculate the remaining quantities from our results .",
    "our final model is an independent quantisation of the five lowest non - zero modes , treating the remaining four in harmonic approximation .",
    "the potentials for the lowest five modes includes the _ difference _ of the local harmonic energy and the harmonic energy at the minimum , @xmath86 the rotational energy is treated in a similar way , i.e. , we subtract the result at the minimum . the final result for the ground state energy is @xmath87 here we exhibit that we independent quantise modes three to five , and have an explicit two dimension problem for the lowest two modes . the various quantities in this expression",
    "are found to be ( obtained in ways discussed above ) @xmath88 taking all this together , and subtracting three times the @xmath3 result , we find @xmath89 if we use our three parameter sets , we find values of @xmath90 for anw , @xmath91 for anw and @xmath92 for r. these values are still high above the threshold , but please note that we have overestimated the effect of the lowest five modes by treating them as independent .",
    "furthermore , some of the higher modes lead to a separated single hedgehog and a doughnut .",
    "our experience from the @xmath4 case suggests that in such cases the harmonic approximation may be relatively poor , and again leads to an overestimate .",
    "we have found a reduction of the energy , however , which is at least promising for a more mature approach to the problem .",
    "we have shown that our best treatment for the @xmath4 problem leads to a state close to threshold ( a few tens of mev above or below ) for a reasonable choice of parameters . at the moment",
    "this uses a enhanced version of the quantisation in the attractive manifold .",
    "what is really missing is the hamiltonian in the full manifold , which is not readily accessible , even though one might consider cross - linking the three channels discussed in our paper , ref .",
    "@xcite . using a different numerical approach to study the modes leading away from the @xmath4 hedgehog , as done by waindzoch and wambach @xcite , may be another useful tool to get more information .",
    "it is unlikely that any of these methods will be able to completely cover the whole collective surface , however .",
    "a more pressing problem is the issue whether we can really construct a decoupled 12-dimensional collective surface .",
    "our results about level crossings in the attractive channel seem to suggest that it may not be possible to do so  or maybe we can , but we need to introduce a monopole geometric phase in our collective hamiltonian , which should influence the dynamics and the rotational quantum numbers .",
    "this is an important issue in the quantisation of the @xmath4 system .",
    "the @xmath2 system apparently benefits a lot when the anharmonicities are taking seriously . in the present calculation",
    "we have not treated all of them .",
    "that is at least partly due to the fact that the jnr instantons are not the most general ones for this case .",
    "the fact that the lowest two modes separate in two bananas instead of three @xmath3 skyrmions as the monopole result from ref .",
    "@xcite seems to suggest should happen , is probably related to this deficiency .",
    "it is therefore necessary to see whether one can handle the ahdm instanton @xcite in calculations of the type performed above .",
    "this is not trivial , since the relation between skyrmion and ahdm data is rather indirect , and may just be too time consuming to implement .",
    "we are currently examining the feasibility of this approach .",
    "if we can we will be able to better address the anharmonicities for @xmath2 and probably also see whether large amplitude fluctuations play a rle for the @xmath93 system .",
    "i thank the institute for nuclear theory at the university of washington for its hospitality and the department of energy for partial support during the initial stages of this work .",
    "i also acknowledge partial support by the bundesministerium fr forschung und technologie .",
    "i benefited from discussions with n. manton and c.j .",
    "the instanton field is generated by four poles , arranged in an tetrahedron .",
    "all weights are equal .",
    "we choose @xmath94 where @xmath83 is a parameter determining the size of the tetrahedron .",
    "since all continuous symmetries are broken , we find 9 zero modes . in order of increasing frequency",
    "the non - zero modes can be interpreted as follows ( we concentrate on how the pole positions change .",
    "of course the weights change as well , but it is harder to classify modes that way . )",
    "since we discuss fluctuations here , they have a natural identification as the gradients of a wave function .",
    "we shall identify those with the standard molecular orbitals found e.g. , in refs .",
    "we shall also apply the standard group representation labels corresponding to these wave functions .",

    "+ the two eigenvectors can be chosen to be @xmath97 and",
    "@xmath98 they correspond to the gradient of the standard wave functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "the two modes , both invariant under a rotation around the x - axis , can be interpreted as follows .",
    "one mode corresponds to rotating the two lines ( 12 ) and ( 34 ) relative to one - another around the x - axis .",
    "the other correspond to stretching the lines ( 12 ) and ( 34 ) , at the same time moving the lines closer .",

    "+ one representative of this mode , the one invariant under a @xmath103 rotation about the 111 axis , has the form @xmath104 the wave function corresponding to the present mode is @xmath105 , which has led to the @xmath102 assignment .",
    "+ in this mode we always keep the three points 2,3,4 in a shrinking equilateral triangle , at the same time moving pole 1 further and further away .",
    "this should probably connect to a well separated system consisting of the @xmath4 doughnut and a single hedgehog .",
    "* @xmath106 , irrep=@xmath102 .",
    "+ one representative of this mode , the one with eigenvalue 1 for a @xmath103 rotation around the 111 axis , has the form @xmath107 the change in pole position is up to an overall translation in the @xmath108 direction the same as found above .",
    "the important difference is that the size of @xmath109 is much larger here ( 0.274 ) , whereas the value found for the previous modes ( .0383 ) is not incompatible with 0 .",
    "+ another interpretation is a rescaling of all poles , with a factor @xmath110 for poles 2,3,4 and @xmath111 for pole 1 .",
    "* @xmath112 , irrep=@xmath113 .",
    "+ this is the breathing mode , as can easily be seen from the mode - vector .",
    "* @xmath114 , irrep=@xmath115 .",
    "+ one representative of this mode , the one with eigenvalue 1 for a @xmath103 rotation around the 111 axis , has the form @xmath116 this is the only mode that mixes with iso - spin rotations .",
    "the change in the space components is consistent with the irrep @xmath115 and a wave function @xmath117 .",
    "after a study of the change in baryon number associated with this mode we conclude that it probably corresponds to a twist , where we turn the baryon density in the 234 triangle , keeping the edges fixed at the point 1 . at the same time a complicated grooming of the triangle relative to the pole 1 takes place ( time - components ) ."
