    "one of the promises of gravitational lenses is to measure the hubble constant @xmath0 ( refsdal 1964 ) from the observed time delays among the images of a variable background quasar source lensed by a foreground galaxy . given a model for the spatial distributions of the stars and dark matter in the lens galaxy , the time delay @xmath3 multiplied by the speed of light @xmath4 is simply proportional to the absolute distances to the lens and the source , hence @xmath5 scales with the size of the universe @xmath6 .",
    "while the time delays are now routinely measured for many systems ( see schechter 2000 ) , a reliable determination of @xmath0 has been hampered to some extent by the intrinsic degeneracy in models of the dark matter potential of the lens ( williams & saha 2000 ; saha 2000 ; zhao & pronk 2001 ) .",
    "the general trend is that a model with a dense dark matter halo gives a small @xmath0 with @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the critical density for the lens at redshift @xmath9 and the source at @xmath10 , and @xmath11 or @xmath12 is the typical surface density of luminous or dark matter at within the einstein ring @xmath13 ( falco , gorenstein , & shapiro 1985 ; kochanek 2002 ) .",
    "given that the value of @xmath0 is now well constrained by other independent methods , such as the hst key project ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is interesting to reverse the angle of the question , and use equation@xmath14([trend ] ) to put more stringent constraint on the dark matter potential of the lens . more specifically in this _ letter _",
    ", we would like to ask the question : how narrow is the allowed parameter space for the lens dark halo which is consistent with a given set of images , time delays , cosmology and @xmath0 ?",
    "in the interest of clarity , we will consider only analytical lens models with a simplified geometry for a hypothetical image and lens system .",
    "we believe our arguments should apply qualitatively to real galaxy lenses as well , and a more detailed application to the quadruple system pg1115 + 080 is given in a follow - up paper ( zhao & qin 2002 ) .",
    "for simplicity we assume the four images form a perfectly symmetric einstein cross with the time delay minima on the y - axis at @xmath15 ( radian ) from the lens center , and the saddle point images on the x - axis at @xmath16 ( radian ) .",
    "for generality we rescale the images , taking the radius @xmath13 as unity in a new @xmath17 coordinate system , so the four images are given by @xmath18_{\\rm minima } = [ 0,\\pm 1],~   [ x , y]_{\\rm saddle } = [ \\pm q,0].\\ ] ] this image configuration implies that a source @xmath19 , exactly behind a spherical lens plus a linear external shear symmetric to the x and y axes .",
    "all lensing properties can be derived from the time delay surfaces . for our model with spherical stellar lens @xmath20 plus halo @xmath21 and a linear shear of amplitude @xmath22 ,",
    "the time delay contours are determined by a dimensionless time delay @xmath23 given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cylindrical radius , and @xmath26 is a constant containing all the dependence on the cosmological density parameter @xmath27 and the lens and source redshifts @xmath28 ; crudely speaking @xmath29 for typical lens and source redshifts in the @xmath2cdm cosmology .    to illustrate the non - uniqueness , we need to find reasonable lens models with similar time delay surface",
    "let s consider the following example of lensing potential for the stars , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total stellar mass enclosed , @xmath32 is the half mass radius , and @xmath33 specifies the cuspiness of the stellar distribution . for the halo we use a nearly isothermal potential @xmath34\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is proportional to the terminal velocity of the halo rotation curve .",
    "note that the function @xmath36 is smoothly connected at the two sides of the radius @xmath37 , which is chosen such that it is just outside the images .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 is a dimensionless tunable parameter to adjust the halo contribution to the surface density at @xmath37 .",
    "the surface density can be computed as @xmath39 so the densities for the stars and the halo are given by @xmath40_{\\rm max}}.\\ ] ] note that the stars have an inner cusp @xmath33 , and the halo density @xmath41 is continuous across the break @xmath37 , and positive everywhere if @xmath42 .    by increasing @xmath38",
    "we can lower the mean densities at the images , hence creating the effect of a negative mass sheet .",
    "this will not affect the positions of the images , but can increase the time delay @xmath43 between the images . as we will see",
    ", this can result in a larger @xmath0 to be consistent with the currently favored high value of @xmath44 .",
    "the deflection strength @xmath45 is effectively the rotation curve squared .",
    "a flat rotation curve corresponds to a constant deflection strength . for our model ,",
    "the stellar and halo masses enclosed inside radius @xmath46 are given by @xmath47.\\ ] ] as we can see the stars converge to a finite mass @xmath31 at infinity and the halo dominates stars and approaches to a finite deflection ( terminal velocity @xmath48 ) .",
    "let s consider a typical lensing system in a standard @xmath2cdm cosmology with @xmath49 with the lens and source redshifts @xmath50 and a time delay @xmath3 @xmath51,~q = 0.5\\,\\ ] ] between the saddle point image at @xmath52 and the minima image at @xmath53 .",
    "the above cosmology specifies the distances to the lens and the source , hence the time delay normalization constant @xmath54    the observed time delay then set the following constraint on the lens model , @xmath55    we solve for the parameters of the lens and the shear to reproduce the four images at @xmath56 , @xmath57 exactly .",
    "the images form at the extreme points of the time delay surface , hence we have the additional constraints @xmath58    it turns out that the allowed models follow a three - parameter sequence , say @xmath59 .",
    "the parameters of a few representative models are listed in table 1 .",
    "the images appear rigourously at the same locations for all four models , which are the minima and saddle points of the arrival time surfaces ( cf .",
    "figure  [ ctt]a ) , and the relative time delay is identical as well for all four lens models ( cf . figure  [ ctt]b ) .",
    "but the mass distributions in the four models are far from similar ( cf . figure  [ vk]a and figure  [ vk]b ) : lensiii and lensiv correspond to systems with a finite stellar core with a very typical half - mass radius @xmath60 about half of the einstein radius @xmath13 ; lensiv is purely in stars , and has no halo .",
    "both lensi and lensii correspond to systems with a strong stellar cusp dominating the halo at small radii ; lensii has a bigger stellar component with a half - mass radius at one @xmath13 .",
    "the above degeneracy is a variation of the well - known mass - sheet degeneracy .",
    "the latter implies that we can increase @xmath0 by reducing the surface density @xmath61 at the einstein radius @xmath13 ( cf .",
    "equation@xmath14([trend ] ) ) , e.g. , by either scaling down the stellar mass @xmath31 or scaling down the isothermal dark halo mass @xmath62 .",
    "but if we reduce the stellar mass @xmath31 and increase the halo mass @xmath62 _ simultaneously _ such that we keep @xmath63 constant ( between 0.10 to 0.13 , cf .",
    "table 1 ) , then @xmath64 will not change , only the terminal velocity of the rotation curve @xmath35 is raised .",
    "the result is a rigorous degeneracy of the stellar vs. halo mass distribution , insensitive to @xmath0 and the observed time delay @xmath3 .",
    "the flux ratio of the saddle image and the minima image can in princinple differentiate some of the models , as shown by fig .  [ mag ] . but assuming a reasonable @xmath65 mag error with the magnitude , and a 10% error with the effective radius , most of the models are in fact degenerate",
    ". in particular , it will be difficult to constrain the mass of the stellar component @xmath31 .",
    "observations of a well - resolved stellar lens can fix the effective radius @xmath66 and perhaps the cuspiness @xmath33 .",
    "this reduces the available lens models drasticly .",
    "nonetheless , the degeneracy between lensiii and lensiv implies that it is still problematic to differentiate between models with dark halo and models without . to break the degeneracy one needs at least an accurate measurement of the external shear @xmath22 to 10% level ( cf .",
    "the parameters of lensiii and lensiv in table 1 ) , perhaps by a combination of strong lensing and weak lensing data .",
    "it is possible to construct many very different models with positive , smooth and monotonic surface densities to fit the image positions .",
    "there are also no extra images .",
    "these models fit the same images , time delay , @xmath0 and cosmology .",
    "some fit the same lens light profile and image flux ratio as well .",
    "hence the models are virtually _ indistinguishable _ from lensing data .",
    "there are severe degeneracies in inverting the data of a perfect einstein cross to the lens models , even if given the hubble constant and cosmology .",
    "these rigourous findings with analytical models are also consistent with earlier numerical models of saha & williams ( 2001 ) and semi - analytical models of zhao & pronk ( 2001 ) .    among the acceptable models the rotation curve can be keplerian or flat ( fig .",
    "[ vk]a ) , so lensing data plus @xmath0 can not uniquely specify the lens mass profile . among models in the literature , isothermal models and other simple smooth models of dark matter halos of gravitational lenses often predict a dimensionless time delay @xmath64 much too small ( e.g. , schechter et al . 1997 ) to be comfortable with the observed time delays @xmath3 and the widely accepted value of @xmath67 . naively speaking",
    "the high @xmath0 suggests a strangely small halo as compact as the stellar light distribution ( kochanek 2002 ) .",
    "but our analytical models suggest that there are still many other options .",
    "the high @xmath0 implies that @xmath68 is small @xmath69 at the images , but this does not necessarily imply a rapidly falling density .",
    "a high @xmath0 does not necessarily mean no dark halo , and models with a flat rotation curve does not always yield a small @xmath0 ( e.g. , compare lensiii and lensiv in figure  [ vk]b , both satisfy @xmath70 ) .",
    "we also comment that it will be difficult to determine the cosmology from strong lensing data alone because the non - uniqueness in the lens models implies that the combined parameter @xmath26 is poorly constrained by the lensing data , even if @xmath0 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given .",
    "we thank the referee p. saha for insightful comments on the cause of the degeneracy .",
