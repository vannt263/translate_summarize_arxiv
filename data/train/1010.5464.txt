    "a second order differential equation can be investigated in geometric terms by using the general path - space theory of kosambi - cartan - chern ( kcc - theory ) inspired by the geometry of a finsler space @xcite .",
    "the kcc theory is a differential geometric theory of the variational equations for the deviation of the whole trajectory to nearby ones . by associating a non - linear connection and a berwald type connection to the differential system",
    ", five geometrical invariants are obtained .",
    "the second invariant gives the jacobi stability of the system @xcite .",
    "the kcc theory has been applied for the study of different physical , biochemical or technical systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the jacobi stability of a dynamical system can be regarded as the _ robustness _ of the system to small perturbations of the whole trajectory @xcite .",
    "this is a very convenable way of regarding the resistance of limit cycles to small perturbation of trajectories . on the other hand",
    ", we may regard the jacobi stability for other types of dynamical systems ( like the ones in the present paper ) as the resistance of a whole trajectory to the onset of chaos due to small perturbations of the whole trajectory .",
    "this interpretation is based on the generally accepted definition of chaos , namely a compact manifold @xmath0 on which the geodesic trajectories deviate exponentially fast .",
    "this is obviously related to the curvature of the base manifold ( see section [ kcc ] ) . the jacobi ( in)stability is a natural generalization of the ( in)stability of the geodesic flow on a differentiable manifold endowed with a metric ( riemannian or finslerian ) to the non - metric setting . in other words",
    ", we may say that jacobi unstable trajectories of a dynamical system behave chaotically in the sense that after a finite interval of time it would be impossible to distinguish the trajectories that were very near each other at an initial moment .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to review the kcc theory , to analyze its relations with the linear lyapunov stability analysis of dynamical systems , and to present a comparative study of these methods in the fields of gravitation and astrophysics .",
    "the jacobi stability analysis has been extensively applied in different fields of science and technology , but presently its applications to the very important fields of gravitation , cosmology and astrophysics have been limited to the jacobi stability analysis of the lane - emden equation @xcite , and to the analysis of the stability of the vacuum in the brane world models @xcite . besides reviewing these examples , we will present in detail several new applications in gravitation and cosmology of the kcc theory , including the analysis of the general relativistic static fluid sphere , and of the interacting dark energy models . in all these cases",
    "we will also carefully consider the physical implications of our stability analysis .",

    "this obviously leads to difference in the meaning of linear stability and jacobi stability .",
    "we present a first example of a dynamical system that has a limit cycle behavior , but which is not jacobi stable in its entirety .",
    "in other words , the brusselator is not robust in its entirety .",
    "the brusselator is a simple biological system proposed by prigogine and lefever in 1968 @xcite ( the name brusselator came from brussels , the city where they lived ) .",

    "in the present paper we reviewed two basic stability analysis methods  ( lyapunov s ) linear stability analysis and the jacobi stability analysis , respectively .",
    "we considered the stability properties of several dynamical systems that play important roles in gravitation and cosmology  newtonian polytropes , described by the lane - emden equation , general relativistic fluid spheres , the vacuum gravitational field equations of brane world models , and dynamical dark energy models , respectively .",
    "for all cases we used both methods to investigate stability , ( lyapunov ) linear stability analysis and jacobi stability analysis , or the kcc theory .",
    "the study of stability has been done by analyzing the behavior of steady states of the respective dynamical system .",
    "linear stability analysis involves the linearization of the dynamical system via the jacobian matrix of a non - linear system , while the kcc theory addresses stability of a whole trajectory in a tubular region @xcite .    by using the kcc theory",
    "we have been able to derive some physically relevant results for each of the considered systems . in the case of the newtonian polytropes from the jacobi stability condition",
    "we obtain a restriction of the ratio of the internal energy of the star and of its gravitational energy in terms of ratio of the density and of the mean density of the star . in the case of the general relativistic fluid sphere",
    "the jacobi stability condition gives a physical range of the mass - radius ratio for general relativistic compact stellar type objects . in the case of the brane world models",
    "we have shown that the vacuum on the brane is jacobi unstable for most of the values of the parameter @xmath260 , with the stability region reduced to a very narrow range of @xmath260 .",
    "for all other values of @xmath260 , the vacuum on the brane is unstable , in the sense that the trajectories of the structure equations will disperse when approaching the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the jacobi stability analysis also imposes some strong restrictions on the parameter @xmath261 describing the properties of dark energy in the dynamic dark energy models .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the jacobi stability of a dynamical system can be regarded as the _ robustness _ of the system to small perturbations of the whole trajectory .",
    "thus , jacobi stability is a very conveyable way of regarding the resistance of limit cycles to small perturbation of trajectories . on the other hand",
    ", we may regard the jacobi stability for other types of dynamical systems ( like the ones considered in the present paper ) as the resistance of a whole trajectory to the onset of chaos due to small perturbations of the whole trajectory .",
    "this interpretation is based on the generally accepted definition of chaos , namely a compact manifold @xmath0 on which the geodesic trajectories deviate exponentially fast .",
    "this is obviously related to the curvature of the base manifold ( see section [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the jacobi ( in)stability is a natural generalization of the ( in)stability of the geodesic flow on a differentiable manifold endowed with a metric ( riemannian or finslerian ) to the non - metric setting .",
    "in other words , we may say that jacobi unstable trajectories of a dynamical system behave chaotically in the sense that after a finite interval of time it would be impossible to distinguish the trajectories that were very near each other at an initial moment .",
    "we have also found that for all the dynamical systems considered in the present paper there is a good correlation between the linear stability of the critical points , and the robustness of the corresponding trajectory to a small perturbation . indeed , in the case of the gravitational field equations of the vacuum on the brane , for small values of the parameter @xmath262 the saddle point is also jacobi unstable ( @xmath263 and @xmath264 ) , while the stable spiral obtained for @xmath265 is also robust to small perturbations of all trajectories .",
    "it is also interesting to remark for the same system that for the interval @xmath266 , the stable node is actually jacobi unstable . in other words , even though the system trajectories are attracted by the critical point @xmath267 one has to be aware of the fact that they are not stable to small perturbation of the whole trajectory .",
    "this means that one might witness chaotic behavior of the system trajectories before they enter a neighborhood of @xmath267 .",
    "we have here a sort of stability artefact that can not be found without using the powerful method of jacobi stability analysis . in the present review",
    "we have presented in detail the main theoretical tools necessary for an in depth analysis of the stability properties of dynamical systems that play a fundamental role in our understanding of nature .",
