    "nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath9 ) and three - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) potentials to be used in calculations of properties of few nucleon systems at low and intermediate energies are these days successfully modeled through meson exchanges .",
    "modern @xmath9 potentials based on this picture provide an impressive description ( with @xmath10/datum @xmath11 1 ) of the @xmath9 scattering data below the pion production threshold and of the deuteron properties @xcite .",
    "these potentials often employ the underlying meson - nucleon dynamics only in one - boson - exchange approximation .",
    "one reason for this is clearly the desire for a relatively simple formalism , but it was also supported by extensive studies of the bonn group @xcite which showed numerous cancellations between classes of diagrams with two and more exchanged mesons .",
    "the meson - exchange approach with heavy meson ( and nucleon ) resonances has been supplemented recently by a model - independent construction from a low - energy realization of qcd : chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "while some theoretical uncertainties in the formulation of this theory persist @xcite , the construction of the @xmath9 potential in this framework is already approaching maturity @xcite with the next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) potential also describing the @xmath9 data fairly well .",
    "moreover , a recent paper @xcite by the jlich - bochum group provides a detailed comparison of chpt with phenomenological potentials based on heavy meson exchange , and shows that the low - energy constants of chpt appearing in the two - nucleon sector of the chiral lagrangian agree reasonably well with those following from reducing the heavy meson operators to their contact form .",
    "therefore a mutual positive influence between the two approaches should be expected for the future : the phenomenological potentials should provide a hint on the values of the chiral low - energy constants ( which are not always easily obtained from the experiment ) and the chiral constraints should be imposed on the phenomenological models at low energies . in this spirit some studies of chpt @xmath0 force were performed @xcite , although more extensive numerical calculations are still needed . to describe the data one might have to consider the chiral @xmath0 force from the next order of the chiral expansion @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the role of some short - range heavy meson exchanges in the @xmath0 potential with respect to the binding energy of the @xmath0 system .",
    "in addition to the dominant @xmath6 component of the @xmath0 potential @xcite , we include the force following from @xmath12 exchange @xcite and the terms involving @xmath2 or @xmath4 exchanges from ref .",
    "the latter potentials were obtained both from diagrams with the roper resonance @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ f : short - longandlong - long]b ) and from the nucleon born terms ( often imprecisely called pair- or z - diagrams ) where an off - mass - shell nucleon propagates in the intermediate state ( fig .  [ f : short - longandlong - long]a ) .",
    "all contributions of the born diagrams are of relativistic order . the parts with negative energy propagation , being genuine `` z - diagram '' contributions , are included in the irreducible @xmath0 potential .",
    "also the part with off - shell nucleons propagating with positive energy can not be omitted .",
    "these terms differ in general from the iteration of the @xmath9 potential ( which is not to be included in the @xmath0 force and has to be subtracted from the total amplitude explicitly ) and thus also contribute to the @xmath0 potential .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the effects of the @xmath0 forces based on pion - pion and pion - heavy - meson exchanges .",
    "it is discussed how strongly they depend on experimental uncertainties in the determination of the phenomenological constants in terms of which these potentials are parameterized , and on the model dependence of the nucleon born contributions .",
    "these inherent uncertainties should provide  for such semi - phenomenological meson exchange models  theoretical error bars of the calculated bound state energy of the trinucleon system .",
    "the latest version of the phenomenological tucson - melbourne ( tm ) potential @xcite @xmath6 potential is parameterized in terms of three constants @xmath13 .",
    "these constants are determined from @xmath14 scattering data and we look at the variations of the triton binding energy within the range of their experimental uncertainty , complementing thereby the usually studied sensitivity to the variation of the form factor cut - off parameter .",
    "the pion - heavy - meson exchanges contributions contain also some not very well determined constants , in particular the coupling constants in vertices involving the roper resonance @xmath15 .",
    "but besides that the born terms also depend on the employed form of the @xmath5 couplings",
    ". it is often assumed that the pseudovector ( pv ) coupling is preferable : this is based on the experience with modeling relativistic ope @xmath9 potentials where the pseudoscalar ( ps ) @xmath5 coupling implies unrealistic enhancement of the intermediate negative energy states .",
    "it is also claimed that a pv coupling is preferred because it does not require the non - minimal contact terms to conform with chiral symmetry in processes like pion electroproduction on the nucleon .",
    "however , in constructing the @xmath14 scattering amplitude , or amplitudes of heavy meson production in pion absorption on the nucleon , one has to be more careful .",
    "in these cases one can not state that the use of pv coupling minimizes the contact lagrangians : while it is true for the isospin - even @xmath16 vertex , the isospin - odd contact weinberg - tomozawa interaction is actually close to zero in the representation with ps coupling . if one tries to include the heavy mesons the situation becomes even less clear : to include them one has to extend the symmetry in a model dependent way , e.g. to require the _ local _",
    "su(2 ) @xmath17 su(2 ) symmetry dynamically realized ( and broken ) either in the young - mills fashion or using the concept of hidden symmetry realization .",
    "the construction of these ( approximately ) chiral symmetric lagrangians including heavy mesons is thus model dependent .",
    "it does not allow to formulate the consistent chiral counting scheme and even at the tree level the dynamical content has not been sufficiently constrained by detailed analysis of wide range of hadronic processes , which they in principle should describe .    in this paper",
    "we therefore consider only the born amplitudes and the amplitudes with intermediate excitation of the roper @xmath15(1440 ) resonance , which have been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and have never been included in realistic calculations of trinucleon bound states . since we conclude from the reasoning above that there is no strong reason to prefer the born contributions obtained with pv @xmath18 coupling , we calculate also their ps version .",
    "in contrast with ref .",
    "@xcite we include all these potentials in @xmath0 faddeev calculations exactly , i.e. , without using perturbation theory .",
    "their contributions to the binding energy are given individually .",
    "finally , we relate some of these short - range @xmath0 potentials to the corresponding counterterms from the chiral lagrangian .",
    "we have deduced from the potentials with heavy meson exchange the effective contact low - energy four - nucleon  pion coupling constants and attempted to relate them with the constants of nlo interactions of chpt @xcite . when the heavy meson propagator is reduced to a point",
    ", it appears that the pion  heavy - meson @xmath0 potentials with ps @xmath5 coupling are closer to those obtained from the contact low - energy four - nucleon  pion nlo interactions of chpt @xcite than their pv @xmath5 versions . nevertheless , the comparison with chiral low energy constants is not straightforward , since some of the effective interactions we obtained by taking the point limit are not included in the nlo interactions of chpt , and can be transformed to that form only after certain approximation .",
    "this approximation however does not seem to be numerically supported by results of our model calculations .",
    "this paper is organized into four sections .",
    "section ii contains an overview on @xmath0 forces .",
    "section iii presents the long - long and the long - short @xmath0 forces and the numerical results .",
    "section iv determines the low - energy constants and section v gives a summary and conclusions .",
    "chiral symmetry has been recognized as an important guideline for the construction of nuclear forces , into which the @xmath14 amplitude enters as one of its building blocks , long before the advent of chpt .",
    "the process of incorporating constraints from chiral symmetry ( breaking ) into theoretical studies of the two - nucleon interaction was pioneered by g.  brown @xcite in the early 1970 s .",
    "later , the same ideas were applied to the @xmath0 force , for which two different approaches were developed in parallel :    \\(i ) one is based on the concept of partially conserved axial - vector current ( pcac ) and the current algebra ( ca ) formalism , built from equal - time commutation relations for vector and axial - vector currents .",
    "it underlies the well - known tucson - melbourne ( tm ) two - pion - exchange @xmath0 force @xcite represented in fig .",
    "[ f : short - longandlong - long]c .",
    "it goes beyond the static p - wave @xmath19 contribution to the @xmath14 amplitude , the only building block considered in its predecessor , the fujita - myazawa @xmath0 force .",
    "current algebra and pcac provide an elastic pion - nucleon scattering amplitude which includes the pion - nucleon @xmath20-term , a direct measure of chiral symmetry breaking , which can be extracted from experiment .",
    "\\(ii ) the other approach stems from the so - called `` effective chiral lagrangians '' for the @xmath14 system .",
    "the first example of this approach is the gell - mann and levy linear sigma model .",
    "another example is the chiral lagrangian with pseudo - vector @xmath14 coupling , which underlies the construction of the so - called brazilian @xmath0 force in ref .",
    "more recently , chpt , based on the weinberg lagrangian @xcite supplemented by multinucleon contact terms , became a systematic way to approach two and @xmath0 forces @xcite , and was applied to the description of low - energy hadronic physics .",
    "in particular , it was realized in ref .",
    "@xcite that although the construction of the tm two - pion exchange @xmath0 force employs chiral constraints for @xmath14 scattering through ca , it missed further constraints , which arise from embedding that amplitude in the @xmath0 system .",
    "the conclusion was that the tm form of the two - pion - exchange force contained a spurious term corresponding to contact terms between two nucleons and pions ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this spurious term can be generated also in chpt with the help of a pion field redefinition .",
    "but at the same time an additional two - nucleon contact term arises ( @xmath22 ) , which has not been taken into account by the tm group and which exactly cancels the first spurious contact ( @xmath21 ) contribution . as a net result",
    ", the so - called @xmath23 term of the tm force should be dropped and the so - called @xmath24 term is modified .",
    "we present here the effects of the chirally imposed changes to the tm force on the triton binding energy",
    ". a previous calculation of these effects @xcite used a less realistic @xmath9 interaction and a variational numerical method .",
    "the ca program was extended to describe also @xmath14-@xmath25 transitions , from which a @xmath12 exchange @xmath0 force can be constructed .",
    "it seems natural to include such a mechanism , given the important interplay between @xmath26 and @xmath27 exchange in two - nucleon potentials . to model the @xmath12 @xmath0 force",
    ", one can use vector - meson dominance to access the @xmath27-analogue of the off - mass - shell pion electroproduction .",
    "chiral symmetry is in this case supplemented by gauge invariance to constrain the ward identity amplitude .",
    "the interest in the short - range @xmath0 forces increased in mid 1990 s , when it was found that the lack of binding energy of the triton is not the only experimental signature of a @xmath0 force . according to @xcite a spin - orbit structure of the @xmath0 force , not present in the standard two - pion exchange based forces ,",
    "may solve systematic deviations between the theoretical and the experimental maximum of the nucleon vector analyzing power @xmath28 in elastic @xmath29 scattering below 30 mev .",
    "the tm or the brazilian @xmath0 force either produces no sizable effect or even worsens the disagreement with the data .",
    "but the study of hber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite indicated that the short - long range forces with a structure similar to that given by @xmath4 and @xmath2 exchanges with an intermediate roper resonance @xmath15 @xcite and suggested by the nlo chpt @xcite could potentially improve the description of @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , a purely phenomenological spin - orbit @xmath0 force yields a noticeable improvement of the description of this observable @xcite .",
    "more recently , meissner _ et al . _",
    "@xcite actually claimed that the @xmath30 puzzle can be resolved by a chiral @xmath9 force alone .",
    "however , the @xmath9 interaction employed does not match the high quality of contemporary descriptions of @xmath9 scattering data , in particular , for the crucial triplet p - waves @xcite .",
    "the nlo chiral potential gives a _ qualitative _ description of the phase shifts only for very small energies ( @xmath31mev ) , but for a truly quantitative fit one has to include nnlo corrections @xcite .",
    "entem and machleidt showed that no low-@xmath10 @xmath9 potential , neither one based on heavy - meson exchanges nor one constructed from chpt , can solve the @xmath30 puzzle , since a good fit to the @xmath9 phase shifts ( in particular in the @xmath32 channel ) does not allow the variation needed to fix this spin observable .",
    "in a recent paper of epelbaum _ et al . _",
    "@xcite it was found that nnlo @xmath9 and leading order @xmath0 chiral potentials still do not solve the @xmath30 problem completely . also the urbana @xmath0 force ( a fujita - myazawa force with a short - range regularization determined phenomenologically through a fit to the triton binding energy )",
    "does not provide a solution .",
    "an interesting alternative was suggested by canton _",
    "@xcite , who constructed an additional @xmath0 force by reducing @xmath33 equations below the pion threshold .",
    "their force is very similar in spin - isopsin structure to the @xmath4 and @xmath2 force with intermediate roper resonance discussed above , but it is multiplied by a part of an energy - dependent @xmath9 t - matrix .",
    "in addition to the mentioned @xmath29 scattering problem , a good description of neutron - rich light nuclei is only possible @xcite when a phenomenological @xmath0 interaction with three pion exchanges is added to the original urbana force @xcite . finally , let us mention that while realistic @xmath9 potentials alone predict an equilibrium density for symmetric nuclear matter that is too high , phenomenological @xmath0 forces can change it in the right direction @xcite .",
    "this overall picture indicates that the long - range @xmath26-@xmath26 @xmath0 force needs to be complemented by other physical mechanisms .",
    "the phenomenology of the @xmath9 interaction shows that the most important meson exchanges in every realistic obep are exchanges of the pion , of the vector @xmath27 and @xmath34 mesons , and of the ( fictitious ) scalar @xmath20 meson .",
    "therefore , one should also investigate the role of such exchanges in the modeling of a @xmath0 force .",
    "given the importance of the one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) in determining the long - range part of the @xmath9 interaction , it was natural that the first @xmath0 force considered was the two - pion exchange .",
    "the corresponding diagram is shown in fig .  [",
    "f : short - longandlong - long]c , where the blob represents all possible pion re - scattering processes .",
    "the iteration of the opep has to be subtracted from this feynman diagram , since it is generated automatically by iterating the @xmath9 potential in the faddeev equation .",
    "the @xmath14 amplitude @xmath35 entering the @xmath0 force involves virtual pions .",
    "this off - mass - shell continuation is constrained by the soft pion low - energy theorems . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the ( modified ) tm version of @xmath6 force , which has been constructed to explicitly conform with these requirements .",
    "the tm @xmath6 @xmath0 force @xcite was generated by applying the ward identities of ca to the amplitude of axial - vector current scattering on the nucleon .",
    "using pcac , the resulting @xmath14 amplitude , in the even and odd isospin channels , was written as an expansion in powers of the momentum transfer @xmath36 and the crossing - variable @xmath37 .",
    "then the `` reality test '' was applied with the successful result that ca predicts the first four coefficients of the expansion in good agreement with the empirical subthreshold expansion coefficients obtained from dispersion relations .",
    "therefore , it was possible to use accurate empirical @xmath14 data to construct the nearly model - independent tm force .",
    "the dispersion analysis has been updated over time with the inclusion of new data , therefore the coefficients of the tm force have also evolved .    in terms of physical mechanisms ,",
    "the non - born part of the tm @xmath14 amplitude contains terms that can be interpreted as @xmath36-channel @xmath20 and @xmath27 exchanges , as well as contributions from the @xmath19 resonance in the intermediate state .",
    "the contributions of the subtracted nucleon born diagrams were analyzed in detail in @xcite and it was later shown numerically that they are relatively small @xcite , at least as far as their contribution to the triton binding is concerned .    as argued in @xcite , the tm @xmath14 amplitude ,",
    "although constructed from ca and obeying the chiral constraints in the @xmath14 sector , should not be simply attached to two additional nucleon lines , since that would be inconsistent with the chiral counting for the @xmath0 potential .",
    "more precisely , the tm @xmath14 amplitude can be derived from the usual chiral lagrangian after the pion field re - definition @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the constant of the so - called tm @xmath23-term .",
    "the original chiral lagrangian in the `` natural '' representation acquires after such redefinition two additional terms ( relevant up to the order considered ) @xmath40    \\biglb\\ } \\ , .",
    "\\label{lpicont}\\ ] ] the tm amplitude includes the term corresponding to the first part of @xmath41 ( the @xmath23-term proportional to @xmath42 ) , but in the construction of the tm @xmath0 potential the second term ( which involves two nucleons ) was not considered . therefore , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the tm @xmath23-term should be dropped and its @xmath24-term should be replaced by @xmath43 . the tm @xmath6 force modified in this way was recently adopted in @xcite and labeled tm(99 ) .",
    "however , we would like to point out that it is not correct to transform away the whole @xmath23 term , because it includes the contribution from the born diagrams that contribution arises naturally also in chpt in its usual representation",
    ". nevertheless , since this residual @xmath23-term is rather small and the @xmath6 force is not the main subject of interest of this paper , we avoid introducing further redefinitions of the tm force and we adopt tm(99 ) for our numerical calculations .",

    "note that we distinguish between the mass of the charged pions , @xmath56 mev , and the isospin averaged pion mass @xmath57 mev .",
    "although their difference is small , it affects the 3n force parameters in a noticeable way .",
    "the vertex form factor @xmath58 depends on the cut - off parameter @xmath59 , which in the original tm force was taken to be @xmath60 @xmath61 in order to be consistent with a goldberger - treiman discrepancy of 3% determined at the time .",
    "based on more recent data , the goldberger - treiman discrepancy shrank to about 2% , which corresponds to @xmath59 close to 7.1 @xmath61 . on the other hand , @xmath59 is frequently tuned to reproduce the triton binding energy in calculations that include only the @xmath6 exchange part of the @xmath0 force .",
    "such calculations require much lower values , close to 4 @xmath61 . clearly ,",
    "the functional form of the form factor is not much constrained by the knowledge of the coupling constant @xmath62 at the two points @xmath63 and @xmath64 and thus does not allow a strict determination of a cut - off mass .",

    "in particular , we investigate the question whether the short - range forces are able to reduce the strong cut - off dependence , as one may expect from arguments of chpt .    adopting the values @xcite @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xmath68 , @xmath69 @xmath68 , @xmath70 @xmath68 , and @xmath71 @xmath61",

    "however , we would like to point out that the @xmath0 wave function contains also components which are _ symmetric _ in spin - isospin space ( and antisymmetric in their spatial part ) . for such components",

    "the components of the triton wave function with odd orbital angular momentum between nucleons 1 and 3 contribute about 5 per cent to the total norm . even though the weight of these states in the norm is not large , their effect can become significant in matrix elements of operators with the proper tensor structure .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 p - waves are known to very important for the description of @xmath30 in @xmath87 scattering .",
    "if we neglect for the moment the symmetric spin - isospin wave function components and interactions with nucleon field derivatives , then the effect of the @xmath88 terms is reduced to the calculation of the matrix element of ( [ antisym ] ) . in this approximation , the dimensionless constant @xmath89 of ref .",

    "in fact , the kr contribution dominates our value of @xmath89 , due to the factor 4 in the last term of ( [ cd ] ) .",
    "as in the comparisons above to ref .",
    "@xcite , we had to compare quite different effective lagrangians and the approximations made in establishing the correspondence between the effective constants appear to be too crude to allow drawing clear conclusions .",

    "the conclusions of this paper can be summarized in three points :    \\1 . when considering the effect of the tm @xmath6 exchange 3@xmath94 force on the triton binding energy , only the variation of the cut - off parameter , which is often adjusted to reproduce the experimental value ,",
    "is studied in the literature .",
    "however , the @xmath6 force contains the @xmath26n scattering amplitude as a building block , which at low pion momenta has a model independent form parameterized by three constants which have to be extracted from experiment .",
    "in contrast to the cut - off parameter , each of these three constants multiply different spin - isospin operators , and therefore act differently on the various channels of the wavefunction .",
    "we calculate the propagation of the experimental errors of the @xmath14 data , which are used to extract the off - shell tm @xmath14 scattering amplitude , into the @xmath0 force parameters . as a consequence ,",
    "the triton binding energy calculated with the tm @xmath6 potential has an uncertainty of about @xmath7 mev , which is almost entirely due to the experimental errors in the nucleon sigma term .",
    "the long - short range @xmath4 and @xmath2 exchange @xmath0 forces individually have large effects on the triton binding , but two kinds of cancellations determine their net effect .",
    "we find contributions of opposite sign and comparable or very close in magnitude from @xmath95-graph and @xmath15 excitation , respectively , in the @xmath4 and @xmath2 @xmath0 forces .",
    "also @xmath95-graph and @xmath15 potentials cancel in part for each of these long - short range forces separately .",
    "the extent of the cancellation is controlled decisively by the ratio between the @xmath96 and @xmath97 coupling constants .",
    "if this ratio is taken to be the same as for the @xmath98 and @xmath99 coupling constants , as suggested by the naive constituent quark model , the attraction of the @xmath34 exchange , originated by the born terms of relativistic order , dominates .",
    "the change in binding energy caused by these @xmath0 potentials can not be calculated perturbatively , since their inclusion in the hamiltonian changes the wavefunction significantly .",
    "for instance , we find that , although the net effect of @xmath4 and @xmath2 exchange @xmath0 forces on the binding energy is small , the resulting wavefunction yields rather different matrix elements of individual interactions from the ones calculated without those terms in the hamiltonian",
    ". therefore , it would be very interesting to study these variations in the wavefunction , for instance in electron scattering on the @xmath0 bound state .",
    "furthermore , these potentials may strongly influence low - energy @xmath87 scattering observables .    in the case of ps @xmath5 coupling ,",
    "both @xmath95-diagrams are attractive , resulting in a strong overbinding of the triton . in the future , these @xmath95-diagrams should be complemented by additional potentials derived from chiral contact @xmath100 and @xmath101 vertices .",
    "we extracted the lecs from the low - energy limit of the long - short range meson exchange potentials and compared with the chpt results of refs .",
    "the constants we obtain are of natural size .",
    "unfortunately , a direct comparison with the chpt results is not possible since we arrive at contact vertices of different structure . to translate them into the chpt form certain approximations are necessary , the validity of which we found to be unfounded in our numerical evaluation .",
    "it does not come as a surprise that our lecs do not agree with those of refs .",
