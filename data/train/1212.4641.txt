    "in this paper we continue a study initiated in @xcite concerning self - avoiding walk on the infinite percolation cluster obtained after performing supercritical percolation on @xmath2 .",
    "this problem has been studied extensively in the physics litterature , using non - rigorous methods ( see @xcite for the first paper on the subject , and @xcite for later contributions ) , but its understanding from a mathematical point view remains very weak , the main reason being that self - avoiding walk on @xmath2 is , in many respects already a big challenge for mathematician ( see @xcite for a review ) .    our starting point is to assume that some of the properties of the walk , such as the replica overlap ( i.e.  the mean proportion of edges shared by two independent trajectories ) and the end - to - end distance can be deduced from the asymptotic behavior of the partition function @xmath0 , which is simply the number of open self - avoiding path of length @xmath1 from the origin .",
    "this belief is somehow ascertained by both the physics literature ( e.g. see @xcite ) and analogies with rigorous results obtained for directed polymers in a random environment @xcite , but has not yet been brought on rigorous ground ( and we will not do it in this paper )",
    ". hence our main object of study will be the growth rate @xmath9 .",
    "in @xcite we have aproved the existence of a quenched connective constant for the percolation cluster , or in other words , that the upper growth - rate of @xmath0 is not a random variable .",
    "we also proved that in two dimension , this upper - growth rate is always strictly smaller than the growth rate of the expected value , underlining a localization phenomenon .",
    "our aim in this paper is to show that there is a phase where localization occur also in high dimension : that when @xmath6 is large and @xmath10 is close to the percolation threshold , @xmath0 does not grow as fast as its mean value .",
    "our result apparently contradicts some of the prediction made in the litterature .",
    "for instance in @xcite , @xcite and many pait is claimed that disorder never modifies the behavior of the trajectories above the percolation threshold .",
    "the reason for this contradiction might be that some author may have considered the `` annealed model '' ( where averaging with respect to the percolation cluster is performed ) which is mathematically trivial .    on the other - hand our result agrees with the predictions present in @xcite . furthermore according to le doussal and machta @xcite",
    ", this localization phenomenon does not occur for small dilution , i.e.  when @xmath10 is close to one .",
    "this means that there is a non - trivial transition in @xmath10 separating a phase where trajectories are delocalized from one where the are delocalized . on the mathematical level , this remains a challenging conjecture .",
    "we consider @xmath11 the set of self - avoiding path of length @xmath1 starting from the origin in @xmath2 which is equipped with its usual lattice structure .",

    "the self - avoiding walk of length @xmath1 on @xmath37 is the process defined on @xmath11 by the probability law    @xmath38    the general idea is that if @xmath0 behaves asymptotically like its expected value , it means that the environment is spatially averaging so that the self - avoiding walk in the inhomogeneous medium keeps the features of self - avoiding walk on @xmath2 ( see e.g.  @xcite for conjectures and mathematically proved results ) . on the other hand if @xmath39 $ ] , and _ a fortiori _ if the two quantities have a different behavior on the exponential scale ( _ i.e. _ if @xmath40 ) one should observe localization of the trajectories under @xmath41 ( see @xcite and references therein for the case directed polymers , and @xcite for physicists prediction ) .",
    "an important issue is then to decide whether a genuine phase transition occurs at @xmath42 _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath43 .",
    "in @xcite , we proved that in dimension @xmath44 , the inequality is always strict for all values of @xmath45 so that there is no phase transition ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "le doussal and machta @xcite believe that this is the case also for @xmath47 , and we agree with this conjecture although it should be difficult to prove with available tools ( see the introduction of @xcite for more discussions ) . on the contrary , when @xmath48 , the same authors conjectured that for small edge dilution , the disorder is irrelevant : in other words that for @xmath10 close to one @xmath49 or that @xmath50 .",
    "note that the conjectures in @xcite are not formulated for the connective constant but in terms of trajectorial properties .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the question : is @xmath7 in general ? we give a positive answer to this question in high dimension .",
    "the strategy we adopt to prove such a result presents some similarities with the one we used in @xcite to solve an analogous question for the problem of oriented percolation : we prove an asymptotic lower bound on @xmath42 which is larger than the asymptotic development in @xmath51 of @xmath23 .    the asymptotic development for the percolation threshold up to the third order has been computed by hara and slade @xcite using the lace expansion .",
    "they proved that @xmath52 see also @xcite for a related result and a bibliography on this topic .",
    "let us present now our main result    [ mainres ] given @xmath53 ,",
    "when @xmath6 is large enough and @xmath54 then @xmath55    as a consequence when @xmath6 is large enough , @xmath56      our method to obtain a lower bound on @xmath42 relies on three ideas : the first one is to consider the size biased measure where the probability of a given environment is proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "this gives us a nice characterization of the strong disorder regime @xmath58 : see lemma [ sizebi ] .",
    "the second idea is to use a special construction of the size biased measure sometimes referred to as the _ spine construction_. it says that the environment under the size - biased law can be obtained by opening a self avoiding path of length @xmath1 chosen uniformly at random ( the spine ) , and opening every other edges in @xmath2 independently with probability @xmath10 : see lemma [ spine ]    finally , and this is the most important step , we use this spine construction to show that additions of edges around the spines can generate a lot of open paths , showing that the size - biased measure and the original one are very different when @xmath10 is small ( proposition [ mainprop ] ) .",
    "all these three ideas were used in an earlier work concerning oriented percolation @xcite , and the way to proceed for the two first step is exactly identical . however ,",
    "here the final step is much more involved and requires some heavy - machinery for several reasons : the possibility of interaction between the walk and its past , the modification of the length when adding `` bridges on the walk '' etc ...    at first sight , after reading our proof , one could think that the asymptotic lower - bound we find for @xmath42 is larger than @xmath23 for accidental reasons and that it might not be satisfied for some other type of high dimensional lattice .",
    "this is however not the case : the fundamental reason for the difference between the two is that the contribution of `` square of open edges '' ( i.e.  of regions where four edges forming a square are open ) is more important under the size - biased measure than under the original one . in the high dimensional limit , the contribution of these open square gives the leading asymptotic term for @xmath59 .",
    "thus our result can be expected to be true for percolation models in the mean - field limit ( see for instance @xcite where the same result holds for directed percolation essentially for the same reasons ) .",
    "we believe that @xmath7 in all dimensions but we currently have no argument to justify it for finite @xmath6 .",
    "note finally that we did not try to explicit what @xmath6 large enough in theorem [ mainres ] means .",
    "the reason for that is that quantitative estimates would be quite hard to derive and in any case , very suboptimal .",
    "the size biazing technique consist in studying the process under a new measure , which gives a larger probability to environments @xmath60 for which the partition function @xmath0 is larger .",
    "we introduce @xmath61 the renormalized partition function    @xmath62    note that the inequality is strict if and only if @xmath61 decays exponentially fast .",
    "we define @xmath63 the size biased - law , which is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath16 and whose derivative is @xmath64    the exponential decay of @xmath65 under @xmath16 corresponds more or less to its exponential growth under @xmath63 .",
    "this the content of the following lemma .",
    "[ sizebi ] if there is a constant @xmath66 satisfying @xmath67{{\\;\\leqslant\\;}}e^{-cn},\\ ] ] then @xmath68 .",
    "the result and proof are similar to proposition 4.2 in @xcite , and we include the proof here just for the sake of completeness . the inequality @xmath68 is equivalent to the almost sure exponential decay of @xmath61 .",
    "assume that holds .",
    "then from the definition of @xmath63 we have @xmath69 = { \\widetilde}{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb e } } } \\left[(w_n)^{-1}{\\mathbf{1}}_{w_n\\in [ e^{-cn/2},e^{cn}]}\\right ] \\\\ { { \\;\\leqslant\\;}}e^{c/2n}{\\widetilde}{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb p } } } [ w_n{{\\;\\leqslant\\;}}e^{cn } ] { { \\;\\leqslant\\;}}e^{-cn/2}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the markov inequality implies that @xmath70{{\\;\\leqslant\\;}}e^{-cn}$ ] , and hence by the borel - cantelli lemma , we have @xmath71      the size biased measure can be obtained from the original one by opening all the edges along a randomly chosen self avoiding path .",
    "similar constructions have been used for quite a while for the study of branching structure ( see @xcite ) or directed polymers @xcite .    given a path @xmath72 and an environment",
    "@xmath60 we define the environment @xmath73 with spine @xmath74 by @xmath75    then set    @xmath76    [ spine ] the law of @xmath77 under @xmath63 , is the same as the law of @xmath78 under @xmath79 .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite lemma 1 .      the most important step , and whose proof will be the focus of all the rest of the paper is to show that as soon as @xmath80 , with large probability , a lot of paths are open .",
    "the idea is to use the spine as a backbone to construct a lot of open paths with large probability .",

    "we can associate a square of open edges in @xmath112 which is composed of @xmath44 , @xmath113 , or @xmath114 edges of the spine and the rest forms the bridge ( see figure [ threebridges ] ) .",
    "we call the vertices of that are at the end of two edges of the bridge the free sites ( there is one free site for an @xmath99-bridge and two for a @xmath109-bridge and none for a @xmath103-bridge ) .",

    "this is because if one selects a subset of the @xmath99-bridges and subsets of the @xmath103 and @xmath109-bridges of the same cardinality one can form an open path for @xmath112 that uses the edges of the selected bridges and the edges of the spine elsewhere else like on figure [ superpath ] ( we have to use the same number of @xmath103 and @xmath109 because these type of bridges modify the total length of the path and we want the length to be equal to @xmath1 ) . obviously different choices for the set of bridges give a different path .",
    "= 14 cm    thus our work will be focused on proving that with an overwhelmingly large probability we can construct a lot of bridges with squares that overlap only on spine sites .",
    "the typical value of the number of bridges of type @xmath99 , @xmath103 and @xmath109 at the first order is not difficult to derive at the heuristic level if we accept that in high dimension the spine behaves like a simple random walk : given @xmath121 ( and in large dimension the proportion of indices not in @xmath93 tend to one ) , the probability of a bridge of type @xmath99 being open is @xmath122 so that the typical number of bridges of type @xmath99 is @xmath123n$ ] . for bridges",
    "type @xmath103 we notice that the probability of making a @xmath124-turn for the self - avoiding walk should be roughly the same as for the simple random walk where it is asymptotically equivalent to @xmath125 when @xmath6 is large .",
