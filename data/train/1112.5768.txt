    "in 1957 , lee and yang showed that the thermodynamic functions for quantum - mechanical systems of particles obeying bose - einstein or fermi - dirac statistics can be expressed in terms of cluster functions for the same systems obeying boltzmann statistics @xcite .",
    "this method is based on a cumulant expansion of the grand partition function , and hence referred to as the lee - yang cluster expansion method .",
    "they subsequently applied this method to a dilute system of hard - sphere bosons and discussed the @xmath3-transition of liquid helium-4 @xcite .",
    "however , since a cluster expansion is equivalent to a virial expansion , it is more suitable for dilute quantum many - body systems than dense systems such as liquid helium-4 . unfortunately , back in those days there was no such dilute quantum many - body system .",
    "since then , the lee - yang cluster expansion method has been almost completely forgotten , with only a few exceptions @xcite .",
    "now , however , it seems that the method is best suited to describe ultracold dilute atomic gases . in the present paper",
    ", we extend the lee - yang cluster expansion method , which was originally developed to describe a system of hard - core bosons and fermions with small scattering lengths , to describe ultracold atomic gases of bosons and fermions with large scattering lengths .",
    "the lee - yang cluster expansion method is a cumulant expansion of the grand partition function in terms of fugacity @xmath4 , and enables us to treat a quantum many - body problem systematically , where @xmath5 is the chemical potential and @xmath6 is the inverse temperature with the boltzmann constant @xmath7 .",
    "although we usually apply the matsubara green s function method or the feynman graphs to tackle quantum many - body problems , the ranges of validity of these approximations are often not well controlled . on the other hand ,",
    "the lee - yang method allows us to make a perturbation expansion in terms of the number of the interacting atoms , and utilize the fugacity expansion of the grand potential density , which is equivalent to a virial expansion .",
    "moreover , the cluster expansion ( or virial expansion ) for the unitary fermi gas is currently of great interest @xcite , because the cluster integrals ( or virial coefficients ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 have recently been measured using a mixture of @xmath10li in the two lowest hyperfine states @xcite . here",
    ", the virial expansion is @xmath11 , with the pressure @xmath12 and the thermal de broglie length @xmath13 .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to identify the criteria of the off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) of the reduced density matrices in bose and fermi systems @xcite based on the lee - yang cluster expansion method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the quantum cluster expansion method is extended for the case of a two - component bose or fermi system of interacting particles .",
    "we represent the grand partition function and the one- and two - particle reduced density matrices in terms of cluster functions obeying bose - einstein or fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "our extension is formally applicable to a uniform system and a trapped system without local - density approximation .",
    "the derivation and mathematical justification of our method is given in appendix [ app : ce ] . in sec .",
    "iii , we review the rules by which quantum - statistical cluster functions can be computed from the knowledge of quantum cluster functions obeying boltzmann    classical- ( i.e. , boltzmann- ) statistical cluster functions . this formulation was first developed by lee and yang for the case of a one - component system @xcite and it was extended by pathria and kawatra for a multi - component system @xcite . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that the logarithm of the grand partition function as well as the one- and two - particle reduced density matrices can be expressed as a sum over a particular set of lee - yang graphs . for the case of a one - component uniform system ,",
    "the expressions of the grand partition function and the one - particle reduced density matrix were obtained by lee and yang @xcite , and the two - particle density matrix was obtained by de dominicis @xcite .",
    "we generalize these results to the case of multi - component uniform and trapped systems . in sec .",
    "v , we elucidate a physical meaning of lee - yang primary graphs , in particular , that of an infinite series of the ladder - type lee - yang primary graphs , the sum of which leads to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of tightly bound diatomic molecules below a critical temperature @xcite . in sec .",
