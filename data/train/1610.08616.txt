    "based on sensor data , multitarget detection and tracking is the problem of simultaneously detecting targets being present or not , and if present providing their trajectories . it is essential for many applications in the areas of defense , medical science , traffic control and navigation @xcite .",
    "traditional probabilistic algorithms @xcite-@xcite for target tracking address the point target , which assume that one target generates at most a single measurement per time step , and one measurement is originated from at most one target . in many practical scenarios , however ,",
    "typical multipath target tracking systems include the skywave over - the - horizon radar ( othr ) @xcite in which high - frequency signals from the same one target are scattered through different ionospheric layers , giving rise to multiple unsolved detections at each dwell , the passive coherent location ( pcl ) system @xcite with multistatic configurations where one target may generate multiple detections from different transmitters of opportunity , and where dense terrain can cause multiple delayed returns @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most applications of extended target tracking are in computer vision @xcite .",
    "in , if a tracking algorithm is able to properly extract all available information contained in the multiple measurements , the accuracy of estimation for targets can be improved and the number of false tracks can be reduced due to the increase of signal - to - noise ratio @xcite . however , because of the additional uncertainty of measurement - to - path association , its computational complexity increases significantly , as illustrated in the following two aspects .",
    "one is _ multipath tracking _ with the following challenges :    * data association : measurements yielded from need to be associated with one of the tracked targets ; * path association : the target - originated measurements need to be associated with one of the propagation paths ; * high - dimensional estimation :",
    "the tracker has to handle high - dimensional latent - state parameters including target detection , estimation , and multipath data association ; * combinatorial explosion : the multipath data association problem consisting of data association and path association is combinatorial ; * coupling : the problem of target detection and tracking is coupled with the multipath data association .",
    "the other is _ multipath detection _ : the number of targets to track is unknown and possibly time - varying . in the absence of prior information the sensing environment",
    ", targets may appear and disappear at any time in any place .",
    "moreover , both multipath target detection and tracking are challenging on their own .",
    "furthermore , they are tightly coupled .",
    "many of previous researches follow the popular tracking - by - detection paradigm concentrated on the multipath tracking problem , which can be summarized as three categories .",
    "methods in the first category reformulate the multipath target tracking as two sequential sub - problems : single - path target tracking @xcite and multipath track fusion @xcite .",
    "they are computationally effective and easy to in practice , but the fused tracks are not always reliable by the fact that multipath tracks are not accurate and even missed in the low detection probability case .",
    "another challenge for this category is to account for , which may arise due to common process noise for target dynamics , or if the same measurements are used to update two or more multipath track state estimates @xcite .",
    "the second category algorithms address the multipath data association by extending the classical single - path data association algorithm to the multipath case , such as multipath probabilistic data association ( mpda ) @xcite , multihypothesis viterbi data association @xcite , multi - detection joint probabilistic data association @xcite , multi - detection multiple hypothesis tracking @xcite , multi - detection probability hypothesis density @xcite , and multi - detection bernoulli @xcite .",
    "they exploit the available multipath measurements to improve tracking performance but suffer from greatly increased computational complexity .",
    "another drawback of this category is that they can not deal with the coupling of multipath data association and state estimation , which means an error ( e.g. , a track is by chance associated with clutter or / and choose a wrong path ) can not be corrected once it has been made @xcite .",
    "the key idea in the third category of algorithms is to perform the target state estimation and multipath data association jointly based on approximate bayesian inference .",
    "the stochastic approximate approaches such as markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) which sampling strategy in the joint state space of target states and data association variables @xcite , @xcite , are computationally demanding , limited to small - scale problems @xcite .",
    "the deterministic approximate approaches such as variational bayesian ( vb ) @xcite and expectation - maximization ( em ) @xcite which turn the inference problem into an optimization problem and obtain the analytical approximations to the posterior distribution of the latent variables , tends to be faster and easier to scale to large data @xcite .",
    "the existing em - based algorithms @xcite carry out the state estimation and multipath data association identification iteratively in e - step and m - step , which are theoretically attractive and desirable to deal with the coupling of identification risk and estimation errors @xcite .",
    "however , the em - based algorithms are limited to the scenarios when the number of targets is known , .",
    "the vb algorithm overcomes this drawback of the em by introducing _",
    "a prior _ information , and thus opens up the possibility of determining the optimal number of targets @xcite .",
    "moreover , vb is superior to em in the case of high - dimensional latent variables @xcite .",
    "most recently , the variational bayesian ( vb ) approaches have drawn attention in data association of point target tracking since they have advantages of closed - form analytical solution and convergence guarantee .",
    "vb was first applied to data association in @xcite , addressing the problem of distributed tracking using wireless sensor networks .",

    "lzaro - gredilla et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a mixture of gaussian processes to model every trajectory , and learn the hyperparameters of mixture gaussian based on the vb algorithm .",
    "turner et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a complete variational tracker based on vb framework to retain the framing constraints and model tracks that are dropped in @xcite .",
    "it can simultaneously perform inference for track management , data association , and state estimation with linear computation cost in batch window length as opposed to the exponential scaling of previous map - based approaches .",
    "lau et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a complete multitarget tracking algorithm based on structured mean field approach with existence - based model .",
    "inspired by the work of @xcite , we develop a vb - based method ( jdt - vb ) with polynomial computational complexity to solve the joint detection and tracking for multiple multipath targets in this paper . by constructing the conjugate",
    "_ prior _ distribution function , the posterior probability density or mass function of multipath data association , state estimation , and target detection are derived in the vb iterative loop .",
    "the _ forney style _ factor graph for modeling the data association assignment matrices is described in detail , and the loopy belief propagation ( lbp ) for approximating the expectation of the assignment matrices is proposed .",
    "the simulation of othr multipath multitarget tracking with the unknown number of targets is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the jdt - vb algorithm . in summary",
    ", we make the following contributions :    * we incorporate data association , path association , target detection and trajectory estimation in a unified bayesian framework for multipath multitarget joint detection and tracking with time - varying number of targets . *",
    "we derive the closed - form analytical expression for each posterior distribution of latent variables based on the variational bayesian iteration . *",
    "we employ a _ forney - style _ factor graph for modeling the multipath data association and apply the lbp algorithm for approximating the multipath assignment matrices . * we present a multipath measurement clustering method for initialization of jdt - vb .",
    "the computational complexity of jdt - vb is analysed to be polynomial ; * we extract the multipath information both at the level of detection and at the level of tracking to improve the performance of our proposed algorithm .    a preliminary version of the results presented here appeared in a conference paper @xcite .",
    "here , we present for the first time the entire formulation including important implementation details , the initialization , computational complexity analysis , and the additional simulation work .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
