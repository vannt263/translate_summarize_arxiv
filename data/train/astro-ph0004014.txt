    "polars , a subgroup of magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ) , contain a highly magnetized white dwarf with polar field strengths ranging from @xmath0 10 mg @xmath0 to 230 mg ( see beuermann 1998 and references therein ) , and which accretes from a late  type main sequence star .",
    "the magnetic field of the white dwarf is strong enough to phase  lock its rotation with the orbital period .",
    "these systems are strong x - ray emitters in both soft and hard x - ray bands ( see review by cropper 1990 ) .",
    "while hard x - rays and optical cyclotron radiation are emitted from a standing shock above the white dwarf surface , soft x - rays originate from hot photospheric regions heated either by irradiation from the post - shock plasma ( lamb & masters 1979 ) or by dense plasma blobs carrying their kinetic energy deep into the atmosphere ( kuipers & pringle 1982 ) .",
    "irradiation is important primarily for flow rates sufficiently low for the shock to stand high above the surface .",
    "however , a large fraction of the reprocessed radiation appears in the uv rather than at soft x - rays , as shown quantitatively in the prototypal system amher ( gnsicke et al .",
    "while the soft x  ray component is in general adequately fitted by a black  body spectrum with a temperature of a few tens of ev ( even if more sophisticated models are sometimes needed : see e.g. van teeseling et al .",
    "1994 ) , it has recently become clear that a simple thermal plasma model is no longer adequate in reproducing the hard x  ray emission of polars . reflection from the white dwarf surface , complex absorption and multi  temperature emission may contribute significantly to the spectrum above a few tenths of kev ( e.g. cropper et al . 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "polars are known to display long  term luminosity variations on several timescales ranging from tens of days to years .",
    "these variations are thought to be related to changes in the mass transfer rate from the secondary star .",
    "the best studied example is again the brightest polar amher ( cropper 1990 ; gnsicke et al .",
    "such changes come along with spectral variations in all energy bands , indicating changes not only in the spectral parameters of the primary radiation but also in the reprocessed emission .",
    "the relative proportion of hard and soft x - ray emissions is expected to be sensitive to the actual accretion luminosity .",
    "this long  term variability is scarcely monitored and important questions related to changes in accretion parameters and in accretion modes ( such as switching from one  pole to two  pole accretion ) , as well as to the processes of energy release , are still unanswered .    to properly address some of these issues , a long  term monitoring program of the prototype amher was set up with the bepposax satellite in order to investigate its long  term behaviour on a wide ( 0.1100 kev ) x - ray energy band simultaneously .",
    "these observations have been complemented with optical photometry for a more comprehensive study .",
    "bepposax ( boella et al . 1997 ) observed am her three times , with the source in very different states : a deep low state , an intermediate state , a high state .",

    "such a fast change in the accretion rate is not easy to accommodate with current scenarios of mass transfer from the secondary and it represents a serious challenge to theoretical models .",

    "both lecs and mecs detectors reveal the typical orbital modulation at @xmath8 . adopting the linear polarization ephemeris quoted in heise & verbunt ( 1988 ) , the folded light curves in different energy bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ interm_lc ] .",
    "these are single peaked with a broad maximum ( bright phase ) centered at @xmath9 and extending between @xmath10=0.40.8 and with count rates dropping to zero between @xmath11 ( faint phase ) .",
    "the general shape of the soft and hard x - ray light curves is typical for the intermediate / high state of amher , and the bepposax light curves resemble closely those obtained with asca in 1993 ( ishida et al .",
    "1997 ) during a prolonged high state ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the asca light curves are included in fig .  [ interm_lc ] for comparison .",
    "hence during this epoch amher was in its  normal \" accretion state , dominated by the primary pole , which is self - occulted during minimum .",
    "as in the asca or ginga observations , no significant emission from the secondary pole is observed .",
    "noteworthy is the similarity between the high energy ( @xmath13 0.6kev ) light curve shapes of bepposax and asca .",
    "an energy dependence of the light curves is also apparent ; the curves are more sinusoidal at higher energies ( above 4kev ) while more structured at lower energies . unlike the faint phase count rates , which behave similarly to those at higher energies ( i.e. reaching the zero level ) , the bright phase in the softest range ( 0.1 - 0.4kev ) increases between @xmath14 0.50.7 , possibly suggesting a secondary minimum , not covered by the data , at earlier phases .",
    "indeed , the shape of this low - energy lecs light curve departs from the soft x - ray asca light curve ( 0.40.6 kev ) which in turns compares well with the euve light curve of am her obtained during a high state , revealing revealing geometric absorption effects in the emission of the main pole ( paerels et al .",
    "1996 , sirk & howell 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , a tendency in the hardness ratios to soften at the rotational minimum is inferred , [ ( 4 - 10kev ) - ( 1 - 4kev)]/[(1 - 4kev ) ] + ( 4 - 10kev ) ] being -0.29 while it is -0.08 during the bright phase ( see also sect . 3.2 and 4 ) .",
    "also , during the bright phase a significant flickering activity of @xmath15 with respect to the average is observed in the mecs detector on timescales ranging between 2mins and 15mins , while the poor statistics in the lecs detector prevent any detection of rapid fluctuations .",

    "a soft x - ray flaring behaviour during high states is not uncommon for amher ( priedhorsky et al . , 1987 ; ramsay et al .",
    "1996 ) , but with much shorter time scales ( from @xmath0 30s to a few minutes ) .",
    "we note , however , that the statistics of lecs data does not allow us to exclude that the observed flares are constituted by train ( or series ) of shorter events .    in order to inspect the orbital modulation also in the softest channels ( @xmath52 0.4kev ) ,",

    "the bepposax high state light curves are different from any previous x  ray dataset . particularly remarkable",

    "the high count rate at orbital minimum and the modification of the rise and decay shapes of the maximum at high energies suggest a contribution from the secondary pole , which is expected to come into view between @xmath57 0.90.4 ( heise et al .",
    "the lack of a clear soft x - ray modulation indicates that amher was not in the so - called  reverse \" mode observed by exosat in 1983 ( heise et al .",
    "1985 ) , where the secondary pole was dominating the soft x - ray orbital modulation , but rather in an ",
    "atypical \" low soft x - ray mode , where the soft x - ray emission from the main pole is comparable to that from the secondary pole .",
    "an atypical , but not similar , behaviour was observed in amher during a high state in 1976 ( priedhorsky et al .",
    "1987 ) where no orbital modulation was detected in both soft and hard x - rays . at that epoch",
    "the source also showed a soft x - ray flaring activity .",
    "the soft x - ray flux was lower by a factor of three than that usually observed during high states .",
    "for this uncommon behaviour a shift of the primary pole accretion column and corresponding changes in the absorption pattern were claimed ( priedhorsky et al .",
    "this interpretation however can not work for the observed behaviour during the 1998 high state , since the lack of orbital modulation is detected only in the soft band .",
    "it is hence more likely that the main accreting pole dominates the hard x - ray emission while the secondary pole emission is essentially soft ( see also sect .",
    "a low soft x - ray emission at all phases could be produced by a decrease in the efficiency of blobby - accretion onto both primary and secondary poles ( see also sect . 5 ) .    at intermediate energies",
    "a dip is clearly present in the light curve .",
    "an inspection of hardness ratios in different bands reveals a clear hardening at the maximum ( @xmath54 0.55 ) , suggesting absorption effects in the accretion column over the main accreting pole .    from fig .",
    "[ high_unfold_lc ] , variations on time  scales shorter than the orbital period are apparent .",

    "peak features at 1.11mhz , 1.44mhz and 2.57mhz corresponding to 900s , 694s and 389s are also detected at @xmath59 level , and possibly related to flickering produced by inhomogeneities in the accretion flow .",
    "intermediate state white light photometry reveals weak ( @xmath0 0.18mag ) orbital modulation but strong ( @xmath60 0.4 - 0.5mag ) flaring - type cycle - to - cycle variability which , together with the short duration of the observations , only allows one to identify a maximum around @xmath61 .",
    "the flare durations range between a few mins to a few tens of minutes .",

    "1987 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the u and b band light curves are different , though the primary minimum around @xmath54 0.5 is still observed and the secondary minimum can be possibly recognized in the b filter despite of the presence of short - term variability ( see below ) .",
    "noteworthy is that in the u band the shape is sinusoidal - like with a maximum around @xmath62 .",
    "this is consistent with what observed in may in white light and during other intermediate states ( beardmore & osborne 1997 ) .",
    "however , there is a marked difference with respect to low state optical observations ( bonnet - bidaud et al .",

    "a detailed modeling of the v band orbital modulation with cyclotron emission is the subject of a forthcoming paper ( gnsicke et al . in preparation ) .",

    "as the blackbody temperature is constant , the increase of the soft emission is due to an increase of the emitting area .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the secondary pole is active .",
    "furthermore , the fact that a similar increase is not present in the hard component suggests that , at the secondary pole , accretion mainly occurs in the form of high density blobs , shocking deep in the photosphere .    a search for any phase  dependence of the partial absorption ( fig .",
    "[ abs ] ) has also been performed .",
    "the column density ( upper panel ) of the absorber has a maximum around @xmath87=0.40.7 , while the covering factor ( middle panel ) increases steadily up to around @xmath66=0.50.6 , and then decreases .",
    "this is not surprising , because at this phase the angle between the line of sight and the accretion column is minimum , and then the amount of cold matter along the line of sight is likely to be the largest .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ abs ] , the equivalent width ( ew ) of the iron k@xmath88 6.4 kev line is plotted .",
    "the @xmath10dependence of this parameter is what expected if the line is originated in the white dwarf photosphere illuminated by the hard x  ray radiation emitted by the post  shock region .",
    "in fact , because the photosphere is optically thick , the line ew has a well known angular behaviour ( matt et al .",
    "1991 ; george & fabian 1991 ; see also matt 1999 ) , decreasing with the viewing angle .",
    "* this is shown in the figure , where the expected line ew ( calculated following basko 1978 and assuming : a plane parallel geometry ; a 13.7 kev bremsstrahlung illuminating spectrum ; and an iron abundance of 0.89 times the solar value , see table  3 ) is also plotted ( solid curve ) , adopting the inclination and colatitude of the primary pole as given by cropper ( 1988 ) .",
    "*    finally , the spectrum during flares has been analysed , summing data from all flares .",
    "the spectrum is significantly softer than during quiescence , whatever the phase . for an assumed distance of 91pc ( gnsicke et al .",
    "1995 ) , the blackbody luminosity is in fact 12.4@xmath89@xmath90 erg s@xmath5 , while that of the hard emission is 2.29@xmath91@xmath90 erg s@xmath5 , the ratio being then @xmath05.4 .",
    "while the parameters of the hard emission are substantially the same , the blackbody temperature is somewhat higher , 30.4@xmath92 .",
    "similar values for the flare and `` quiescence '' temperatures were found from rosat data ( ramsay et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the bepposax data presented here have shed new light onto the temporal and spectral behaviour of amher .",
    "the observations carried out at different brightness levels indicate that the accretion mode can be substantially different . during intermediate states",
    ", accretion occurs mainly in the ",
    "normal \" mode , with the primary pole dominating both hard and soft x - ray emissions . a 20ev soft black body and a 14kev temperature for the thermal plasma are found , provided the inclusion of partial absorption , of a reflection component and of an iron @xmath93 6.4kev line with ew= 150ev .",
    "high states instead can be very different from epoch to epoch .",
    "differently from previous observations , our bepposax high state observation shows a markedly different variability in the soft and hard x - rays . a strong flaring activity characterized by an increase in flux by a factor of 510 with typical exponential rise and decay time - scales of the order of tens of minutes",
    "is observed below 0.4kev . in",
    "hard x - rays the variability is essentially related to the orbital modulation . differently from intermediate and previous high state observations , the presence of significant emission during the faint phase in both soft and hard x - rays provide evidence that the secondary pole is emitting .",
    "furthermore , the lack of an orbital variability in the soft x - ray `` quiescence '' emission contrasts with the strong modulation observed in hard x - rays .",
    "this suggests that soft x - ray emission from the primary pole ( whatever produced by blobs or by reprocessing of hard x - rays ) is highly inefficient .",
    "an atypical low soft x - ray emission period was indeed observed in the past in amher during a high state ( priedhorsky et al .",
    "1987 ) but accompanied by the lack of the x - ray minimum in both soft and hard bands .",
    "while this was interpreted by a shift in the accretion column with a corresponding change of the accretion pattern , the behaviour observed in august 1998 appears to be better explained by the onset of accretion onto the secondary pole whose emission is mainly soft together with a less active soft x - ray production from the primary pole .",
    "it is worth noting that the soft flaring activity appears to be related to both accreting poles .",
    "the observed flaring activity is not uncommon for amher but with much shorter time scales .",
    "furthermore similar variations are not observed in the ubv coordinated photometry indicating that the soft x - ray flares are unrelated to the optical cyclotron post - shock emission .",
    "moreover , spectral analysis of flares indicates a higher temperature of the soft black body ( @xmath0 30ev ) while the hard x - ray emission has not varied .",
    "the august high state bepposax data have also revealed for the first time a strong energy dependence of the orbital modulation which moves from a single - humped shape at high energies ( 430kev ) to a double - humped shape around 1kev .",
    "this effect can be explained in terms of absorption in the accretion column when pointing towards the observer .    for this high state",
    ", it has been possible to perform a phase ",
    "resolved spectral analysis , and to measure the parameters of both black body and optically thin thermal plasma emission along the orbital phase .",
    "the temperatures of both components are consistent with being constant , and compatible with those inferred for the may intermediate state .",
    "the plasma temperature ( 14 kev ) also agrees with the asca data , but not so the black body temperature , which is 25@xmath61 ev ( asca : 32@xmath61 ev ) .",
    "the latter is however in agreement with euve ( 24.5 ev ) ( ishida et al .",
    "the phase dependence of the partial absorber is indeed compatible with an increase of the amount of cold matter when the accretion column is along the line of sight .",
    "the dip observed at @xmath94 is consistent with such an increase , as both covering fraction and column density are higher .",
    "the phase dependence of the ew of the neutral iron line is consistent with an origin in the white dwarf surface illuminated by the hard x - rays from the post - shock regions .",
    "fixing the black body temperature of both intermediate and high states to 25ev and that of the optically thin thermal plasma to 14kev , the bolometric luminosities of these components at the maximum , and adopting @xmath95=91pc , are : @xmath96 and @xmath97 for the intermediate state ; whilst for the high state these are @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we note that while the hard x - ray luminosities are typical of intermediate and high states , that of the black body component during the high state is lower than previously measured .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ model_high ] , which can be compared with that reported by ishida et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the intermediate state in 1993 .",
    "the inferred soft - to - hard x - ray ratio is 1.2 and 1.6 during the intermediate and high state , respectively .",
    "it has been shown that in amher the bulk of reprocessed hard x - ray and cyclotron radiations emerges in the uv range rather than in the soft x - rays ( gnsicke et al .",
    "1995 ) , the latter being mainly produced by the blobby accretion mechanism . during",
    "the high state observed in august , both the inferred black body luminosity and the lack of a clear modulation in the soft x - ray band suggest that discrete accretion onto the primary pole is not as efficient as in other epochs .",
    "given the low level of soft x - ray flux during the faint phase it is not possible to infer the black body luminosity from the secondary pole . from the high state",
    "black body luminosity during the bright phase , information on the mass accretion rate can be estimated .",
    "a value of @xmath100 for a white dwarf mass of @xmath101 is derived . a fractional accreting area @xmath102 is obtained , which is a factor of @xmath0 3 - 10 larger than those derived by gnsicke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and ishida et al .",
    "( 1997 ) respectively during typical high states .",
    "the local mass accretion rate then results to be @xmath0 4gs@xmath5@xmath4 which is too low to make blobby accretion efficient .",
    "as far as flares are concerned , the changes are essentially related to an increase in the temperature of the soft component , as also observed during other flaring epochs ( ramsay et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the increase in black body luminosity and then in the mass accretion rate is a factor of 2 with respect to `` quiescence '' , and comparable to usual high state values .",
    "our estimates of the fractional area of the emitting black body during flares results to be similar to that during `` quiescence '' which gives a low local mass accretion rate of @xmath0 8gs@xmath5@xmath4 . however , since we can not exclude that accretion occurs onto a more localized area , we consider this value as a lower limit .",
    "furthermore , the optical orbital modulation observed in august is typical of amher during high states , where the v band is dominated by cyclotron beaming from the primary pole ( gnsicke et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the secondary pole instead appears to dominate at optical blue wavelengths .",
    "this is very different from low and other high states where the main accreting pole usually dominates the uv and the blue portion of the optical spectrum .    in summary ,",
    "the present observations reveal that amher has switched from a  normal \" accretion mode during the intermediate state of may 1998 into a  two - pole \" accretion mode during the high state of august 1998 , with a less efficient  blobby \" accretion onto the primary pole .",
