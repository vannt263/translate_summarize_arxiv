    "neutrinos have long been anticipated to help answering some fundamental questions in astrophysics like the mystery of the source of the cosmic rays ( for a general discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "for neutrinos in the tev range , prime source candidates are galactic supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "neutrinos in the pev range and above are suspected to be produced by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) with many agn models predicting a significant neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "recently , the icecube collaboration has reported the very first observation of a cosmic diffuse neutrino flux which lies in the 100 tev to pev range  @xcite .",
    "individual sources , however , could not be identified up to now .",
    "while many astrophysical sources of origin have been suggested @xcite , there is yet not enough information to narrow down the possibilities to any particular source .    due to the low interaction probability of neutrinos",
    ", a large amount of matter is needed in order to detect them .",
    "one of the detection techniques is based on the observation of inclined extensive air showers ( eas ) induced by taus from tau neutrino interactions deep in the atmosphere . as these showers are initiated close to the surface of the earth , they are still very young when reaching the detector and hence have a significant electromagnetic component leading to a broad time structure of the detected signal .",
    "in contrast , showers from cosmic - ray nuclei are induced in the upper atmosphere and therefore have a strongly reduced electromagnetic component when reaching the detector . however , because of its low density , neutrino interactions are not very likely to happen inside the atmosphere .",
    "a solution to this problem is to look for so - called earth skimming ( up - going ) tau neutrinos @xcite which interact within the earth or a mountain and produce a tau .",
    "for neutrino energies of about a eev , the charged leptons have a range of a few kilometers and hence may emerge from the earth or mountain , decay shortly above the ground and produce eas detectable by a surface detector . in some cases , two consecutive eass might be observable , one coming from a tau neutrino interaction close to the surface and one from the decay of the resulting tau lepton .",
    "these two showers , coming from the same direction in a time interval corresponding to the tau decay time , can generate a unique signature in the detector called a double - bang event  @xcite .",
    "the detection of such a double - bang event would be very important both from the astrophysical and the particle physics point of view , as it would be an unambiguous sign for an ultra - high energy ( uhe ) tau - neutrino .",
    "up to now , there has been no clear identification of tau neutrinos at high energies .",
    "the detection of pev tau neutrinos through optical signals also seems possible .",
    "a combination of fluorescence and cherenkov light detectors in the shadow of steep cliffs could achieve this goal *  @xcite*. recently , it has also been shown by the all - sky survey high resolution air - shower detector ( ashra ) experiment , that such kind of experiments could be sensitive to tau neutrinos from fast transient objects such as nearby grbs  @xcite.we note , that the recent icecube results do not show any neutrino events at or above the glashow resonance at 6.3 pev  @xcite .",
    "this likely means that there is either a cutoff in the astrophysical neutrino flux below @xmath0 pev or the neutrino spectrum is steeper than the usually assumed @xmath1 spectrum .    in principle also existing imaging air cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) such as magic  @xcite , veritas  @xcite and h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite have the capability to detect pev tau neutrinos by searching for very inclined showers  @xcite . in order to do that , the cherenkov telescopes need to be pointed in the direction of the taus escaping from the earth crust , i.e.  at or a few degree below the horizon .",
    "this is because the trajectory of the tau lepton has to be parallel to the pointing direction of the telescope within a few degrees as the cherenkov light is very much beamed in the forward direction .",
    "for example , the magic telescope is placed on top of a mountain on la palma at an altitude of about 2200 m a.s.l .",
    "thus , it can look down to the sea and monitor a large volume within its field of view ( fov ) . in @xcite , the effective area for up - going tau",
    "neutrino observations with the magic telescope was calculated analytically with the maximum sensitivity in the range from 100tev to @xmath2  1eev . however , the calculated sensitivity for diffuse neutrinos was very low because of the limited fov , the short observation time and the low expected neutrino flux .",
    "on the other hand , if flaring or disrupting point sources such as grbs are observed , one can expect an observable number of events even from a single grb if close by . in the case of magic , however , the topographic conditions allow only for a small window of about 1 degree width in zenith and azimuth to point the telescope downhill . in case of other iact sites with different topographic conditions , the acceptance for up - going tau neutrinos",
    "will be increased by the presence of mountains .",
    "mountains can work as an additional target and will lead to an enhancement in the flux of emerging tau leptons .",
    "a target mountain can also shield against cosmic rays and star light .    for cherenkov telescope sites , very often nights with high clouds",
    "prevent the observation of gamma - ray sources . in such conditions , pointing the telescopes to the horizon could significantly increase the observation time and the acceptance for up - going tau neutrinos .",
    "next - generation cherenkov telescopes , i.e.  the cherenkov telescope array ( cta )  @xcite , can in addition exploit their much larger fov ( in extended observation mode ) , a higher effective area and a lower energy threshold .    in this work ,",
    "we present an update of the work in  @xcite , where a detailed monte carlo simulation of event rates induced by earth skimming tau neutrinos was performed for an ideal cherenkov detector .",
    "neutrino and lepton propagation was simulated taking into account the local topographic conditions at the magic site and at four possible locations of cherenkov instruments : two in argentina ( san antonio , el leoncito ) , one in namibia ( kuibis ) and one on the canary islands ( tenerife ) . in this work",
    ", similar simulations have been performed for the location of the veritas telescopes and for two sites located close to veritas : meteor crater and yavapai ranch .",
    "these two sites were recently also considered as possible locations for cta .",
    "results are shown for a few representative neutrino fluxes expected from giant agn flares .",
    "we would like to stress that in this work we are exploring the effect of different topographic conditions rather than providing a comprehensive survey of potential sites .",
    "the propagation of a given neutrino flux through the earth and the atmosphere is simulated using an extended version of the anis code  @xcite . for fixed neutrino energies ,",
    "@xmath3 events are generated on top of the atmosphere with zenith angles ( @xmath4 ) in the range @xmath5@xmath6 ( up - going showers ) and with azimuth angles in the range @xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "neutrinos are propagated along their trajectories of length @xmath9 from the generation point on top of the atmosphere to the interaction volume , defined as the volume which can contribute to the expected event rate , in steps of @xmath10/1000 ( @xmath11 km ) . at each step of propagation",
    ", the @xmath12nucleon interaction probability is calculated according to parametrization of its cross section based on the chosen parton distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "in particular , the propagation of tau leptons through the earth is simulated .",
    "all computations are done using digital elevation maps ( dem )  @xcite to model the surrounding mass distribution of each site under consideration .",
    "the flux of the leptons emerging from the ground as well as their energy and the decay vertex positions are calculated inside an interaction volume , modeled by a cylinder with radius of 35 km and height 10 km . the detector acceptance for an initial neutrino energy @xmath13 is given by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of generated neutrino events .",
    "@xmath16 is the number of @xmath17 leptons with energies @xmath18 larger than the threshold energy @xmath19pev and a decay vertex position inside the interaction volume .",
    "@xmath20 is the probability that a neutrino with energy @xmath13 and zenith angle @xmath4 produces a lepton with energy @xmath18 ( this probability was used as `` weight '' of the event ) .",
    "@xmath21 is the physical cross - section of the interaction volume seen by the neutrino and @xmath22 is the solid angle .",
    "@xmath23 is the trigger efficiency for tau - lepton induced showers with the decay vertex position at ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and height @xmath26 above the ground .",
    "the trigger efficiency depends on the response of a given detector and is usually estimated based on monte - carlo simulations . in this work",
    ", we used an average trigger efficiency extracted from  @xcite , namely @xmath27% , which is comparable to what was calculated for up - going tau neutrino showers studied in  @xcite .",
    "this is a qualitative estimation and as such it is the major source of uncertainty on the results presented hereafter .     a sample of representative neutrino fluxes from photo - hadronic interactions in agns .",
    "see text for more details .",
    "flux-1 and flux-2 are calculations for @xmath28-ray flare of 3c 279  @xcite . flux-3 and flux-4 represent predictions for pks  2155 - 304  @xcite .",
    "flux-5 corresponds to a prediction for 3c  279 calculated in  @xcite . ]",
    "equation  ( [ aperture ] ) gives the acceptance for diffuse neutrinos .",
    "the acceptance for a point source can be estimated as the ratio between the diffuse acceptance , defined in eq .",
    "( [ aperture ] ) , and the solid angle covered by the diffuse analysis , multiplied by the fraction of time the source is visible @xmath29 .",
    "this fraction depends on the source declination ( @xmath30 ) and the latitude of the observation site ( @xmath31 ) . in this work",
    ", the point source acceptance is calculated as @xmath32 . for energies above 1pev , neutrinos no longer efficiently penetrate the earth and are preferentially observed near the horizon where they traverse a reduced chord of the earth . thus the main contribution to the acceptance comes from a few degrees below horizon . in this work , we simulated propagation of tau neutrinos with zenith angles in the range @xmath33 corresponding to @xmath34sr .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     definitive conclusions on the capability of cherenkov telescopes for detecting tau neutrinos , however , require accurate neutrino - trigger and background simulations which go beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the acceptance / sensitivity to point sources also depends on the source declination ( @xmath35 ) , which defines the fraction of a day for which a source is visible in the sky at zenith angles between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ fig::visibility ] shows this fraction as a function of source declination for the different detector locations . as an example , 3c 279 ( @xmath38 ) and pks 2155 - 305 ( @xmath39 ) are observed for @xmath40% of a sidereal day ( for about 2.4 hours per day ) , while for point sources with declination @xmath41 the observation time is at least two times longer .",
    "the plot also shows that for the different detector locations the visibility has a quite similar behavior . in conclusion , even though the sensitivity window of the earth - skimming analysis in zenith angle is small ( @xmath42 ) , it permits a point source survey in a broad range in declination angles spanning more than @xmath43 in the sky .",
    "fraction of a sidereal day in percent having a point - like source at declination @xmath44 detectable with zenith angle @xmath45 i.e. for the simulated zenith range of earth - skimming ( up - going ) neutrinos .",
    "the fraction of time is plotted as a function of source declination for a few selected sites . ]",
    "in this paper , detailed monte carlo simulations have been employed to evaluate the sensitivity of air cherenkov telescopes to high - energy cosmic tau neutrinos in the pev to eev energy range coming from the horizon .",
    "the simulations use recent predictions for neutrino fluxes in agn flares to calculate expected event rates at the veritas site and two future locations of cherenkov instruments : meteor crater and yavapai ranch , taking into account the local topographic conditions .",
    "the calculated neutrino rates are comparable to what has been estimated for the icecube neutrino telescope assuming realistic observation times for cherenkov telescopes of a few hours . for models with significant neutrino fluxes at energies above @xmath46ev , the sensitivity of cherenkov telescopes actually surpasses that of icecube . for the sites considered , the expected event rates are up to factor three higher compared to what is expected for the la palma site ( magic ) .    201 t.k gaisser and t.stanev , astropart .",
