    "the spectroscopy of plasma evolution from astrophysical radiation instruments ( hereafter _ spear _ , also known as the far - ultraviolet imaging spectrograph or _ fims _ ) have provided the first large - area spectral sky survey of cosmic far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation . the fuv band ( @xmath0 900 - 1750 ) includes important astrophysical diagnostics such as strong atomic cooling lines from hot ( t=10@xmath1 k  10@xmath2 k ) and photoionized plasmas as well as radiation from molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath3 ) fluorescent emission and dust scattered starlight .",
    "we describe the _ spear _ mission and its science motivation , introduce the data by presenting the spatial distribution of the fuv ( @xmath0 1360 -1710 ) sky brightness and the spectra of the entire observed sky , and provide a brief introduction to other @xmath4 science results described in the accompanying papers in this volume .",

    "each instrument uses a collecting mirror , a diffraction grating and an open faced , photon counting micro - channel plate detector .",

    "the activity powered by the energetic plasma shapes the structure of the galaxy , effecting the distribution of metals and driving evolutionary phenomena such as star formation that depend on global morphology . on smaller scales , hot gas can power a variety of radiative , mechanical and chemical phenomena by forming turbulent and evaporative structures , altering chemical abundance via dust ablation or vaporizing dust condensates , and by radiatively influencing the gas ionization balance .",
    "candidate mechanisms ( see @xcite for an overview ) by which interstellar plasmas cool include ( 1 ) energy exchange with surrounding media such as evaporation and conduction , ( 2 ) mechanical cooling such as adiabatic expansion , ( 3 ) direct emissive radiation , and ( 4 ) indirect radiation by way of heated dust - grain emission .",
    "our understanding of shock - ism interactions and the global structure of ionized gas in our galaxy are far from complete .",
    "several models for the origin of this hot ionized gas have been proposed @xcite that make distinctive , verifiable predictions , yet none can be ruled out with current observations .",
    "very hot interstellar diffuse gas ( t ` > ` = 10@xmath2 k ) was first mapped by _ rosat _ soft x - ray ( sxr ) background observations @xcite which show pervasive regions of sxr gas at high latitudes , conceivably caused by hot gas injected into the galactic halo , although uncertainty remains regarding the state of this gas",

    "fuv absorption measurements , limited to sight lines with suitable background sources , can not alone yield the physical state parameters of the hot plasma ( e.g. n@xmath16 , t , pressure , filling factor ) and are not suited to the detection of lines from gas with a large velocity dispersion because placement of the adjacent stellar continuum is problematic .",
    "detection of fuv interstellar _ emission _ lines from the ism has proven to be difficult .",
    "measurements with sounding rocket experiments , short - lived orbital missions and small instruments on interplanetary missions have suffered from inadequate spectral or spatial resolution ; an inability to carefully correct for noise sources such as intense geocoronal emission , bright stars and dust - scattered stellar continuum ; or from integration periods insufficient to obtain sensitive results .",
    "( see @xcite for a review of earlier work . )",
    "space observatories with fuv measurement capability ( e.g. , _ copernicus , iue , hut , orfeus , ghrs , stis , fuse _ ) have been optimized for point source observations and not for measuring faint diffuse spectra over the large angular scales needed to characterize the galactic plasma .",
    "although the _ galex _ mission @xcite was designed to observe large areas of the sky , it has a limited capacity for mapping galactic diffuse emission and must exclude observations of regions including bright stars .",
    "_ galex _ records either a broad - band image including no spectral information , or an objective - dispersion image that obtains low resolution spectra of localized sources but can confuse diffuse sources with angular extent .",

    "about 10 daily orbits are scheduled for astronomy observations .",
    "one or two orbits per day are used for down - looking observations of the northern night - side aurora .",
    "the 3-axis controlled spacecraft platform can use a star tracker to achieve 5@xmath8 pointing knowledge , pointed accuracy of @xmath56@xmath8 , and a stability of @xmath512@xmath8 .",
    "various pointing modes are used for survey , target and calibration observations .",
    "sky survey observations are performed by rotating a spacecraft axis such that the _ spear _ field of view is swept , in a `` push broom '' fashion , perpendicular to its long field of view and in a 180@xmath7 great circle from the north to south ecliptic pole via the anti - sun direction . following the anti - sun progression in this way over one year",
    "would cause a full viewing of the sky with a maximum of overlapped exposure at the ecliptic poles and a minimum of exposure at the ecliptic plane .",
    "calibration observations of stars or small ( @xmath2110@xmath7 ) fields are performed by a `` back and forth '' spacecraft rotation that sweeps the field of view over a limited angle .",
    "the calibration pointing mode , together with reports of the spacecraft roll rate and the view - field s ground - measured width , provide the most accurate positional data and exposure times for the observation of point sources . fixed inertial",
    "pointing toward specific targets can also be performed .",
    "pointings avoid the sun by 45@xmath7 , the spacecraft velocity vector by 60@xmath7 and are limited to zenith angles of @xmath22110@xmath7 .    the satrec mission operations center , daejeon , korea is used to control the mission and receive data .",
    "data are decommutated into spacecraft - time marked attitude and _ spear_-time marked science and engineering information .",
    "the information is passed through a photon reduction processing pipeline ( edelstein et al .",
    "_ ibid _ ) that performs ( 1 ) engineering selection of valid photon events , ( 2 ) correction of detector electronic drift , ( 3 ) transformation from detector to physical  coordinates , ( 4 ) correction of detector distortions , and ( 5 ) marking of photons with universal time .",
    "a mission data processing pipeline creates ( 1 ) a time history of attitude knowledge , ( 2 ) a _ spear _ to spacecraft time association history , ( 3 ) a time - associated sky exposure history and ( 4 ) photon lists with time - associated attitude information .",
    "the mission data products , in concordance with the photon data products , can then be combined to produce fluxed spectra and spectral sky maps .",
    "each photon event is mapped to the sky by using a combination of the spacecraft attitude information , the instrument s bore - sight offset from the spacecraft axis , and the angular position of the event on the detector .",
    "absolute bore - sight is determined by correlating reconstructed sky images with a field of known bright stars .",
    "the spacecraft attitude knowledge , scheduled for report at 1 - 2 s intervals , is determined by a star - tracker and a gyroscope ( gyro ) .",
    "the tracker updates are designed to set the gyro knowledge to @xmath52@xmath8 accuracy every 5 s. the gyro knowledge drifts at 0.2@xmath8 s@xmath17 .",
    "the knowledge error , derived from the drift rate and tracker update history , is assigned by the pipe - line processing for each photon .",
    "the sky location at times in - between spacecraft attitude reports is computed using a spherical coordinate interpolation .",
    "sky exposure is derived according to valid exposure intervals ( typically 60 s ) that are determined by examining operational and telemetry - interruption markers rks interleaved with the photon data .",
    "time - marked exposure records are produced every 1.0 s within valid intervals for each 5 increment within the spectrometers field - viewing angles .",
    "each exposure event can then be mapped to a sky position in a similar fashion as for photons .",
    "exposure events include a weighting factor to account for fractional - second intervals that may occur at the end of valid periods , for partial coverage of a sky pixel , or for other effects such as processing dead - time or angular vignetting ( see edelstein _ ibid _ ) .",
    "time synchronization between the instrument and the spacecraft is based upon an interpolation between spacecraft time reports and a correction that uses precise , synchronized 1.0 hz and 10 hz timing marks which have been interleaved with the instrument data stream .",
    "the timing correction requires careful handling of clock interruptions or erroneous telemetry .",
    "photon events are marked to a precision of 0.1 hz with an estimated timing accuracy of 0.25 s. events with indeterminate time synchronization or shutter position , usually due to corrupted and missing telemetry , are eliminated and correspond to a @xmath52% of the data .",
    "_ spear s _ observational performance depends on sky coverage , sky exposure and mapping accuracy .",
    "we report on the first year s ( 2003 november ",
    "2004 november ) observations . the s-1 mission was designed for a 2-year mission , however spacecraft engineering problems may preclude further science observations . during the first year , 2450 orbits of observations were recorded .",
    "the s-1 attitude control system behavior limits the quality of attitude knowledge reconstruction .",
    "we find that the bore - sight offset is not constant on a per orbit basis due to a variation in the reporting of attitude .",
    "furthermore , the star tracker updates are sometimes lost , resulting in an attitude error caused by gyro drift .",
    "finally , especially toward the end of the year , star tracker updates or attitude knowledge reports are less frequently available . about 40% of our data suffer from some form of these problems .",
    "the precision of attitude reconstruction from multiple , overlapping sky viewings is affected by the attitude system s stability .",
    "we have developed a systematic approach that uses _ spear _ itself as a star tracker to correct for bore - sight variability in survey and calibration sweeps .",
    "this method has been applied to the observation of individual targets and to @xmath5850 survey sweep orbits . for observations that cycle sweeps over one field , the attitude timing delay is varied until l - band stellar images converge .",
    "absolute bore - sight is then determined by using a 2-d correlation of the image to bright stars listed in the td-1 catalog @xcite . for survey or other single sweep observations , a similar correlation is used between td-1 catalog objects and the l - band sweep image , recomputed for variable timing delays .",
    "a single star s image can be reconstructed from multiple viewings to an effective resolution of 10@xmath8 fwhm with a 10@xmath8 positional accuracy .",
    "survey sweep positional corrections in the sweep track direction are found to be @xmath2330@xmath8 ( 2-@xmath24 ) and @xmath238@xmath8 ( 3-@xmath24 ) in the cross track direction . because the s-1 attitude follows a time sequenced command program , _ spear _ can produce an image of a sweep - observed region even when attitude knowledge is compromised or absent .",
    "we anticipate that the attitude correction for a large fraction of the data with yet - uncorrected attitude problems can be improved .",
    "we derive a spectral sky - map of diffuse emission from these data , from which we introduce the appearance of the fuv sky and its total spectrum .",
    "spectral sky maps were created by binning photon and exposure events using the healpix tessellation scheme @xcite with @xmath515 pixels and @xmath0 bins for the l and s bands of 1.0 and 1.5 , respectively .",
    "the accumulations , made only for times when the derived attitude error is @xmath25 30@xmath8 , contains 1.2@xmath2610@xmath27 and 1.4@xmath2610@xmath27 photons for the l and s bands , respectively .",
    "the corresponding sky exposure map for the l - band , shown in figure 1 , covers @xmath580% of the sky and includes features such as deep exposures ( @xmath2810 ksec ) toward calibration and pointed study fields , and exposures of @xmath28500 s degree@xmath29 near the north ecliptic pole where many survey sweeps overlap .",
    "apparent are regions where no coverage exists due to the aforementioned attitude problems , to operational interruptions , and to detector - protective shutdowns while observing fuv intense regions such as the galactic plane .",
    "the integrated exposure for the instantaneous field of view is 987 ks , with an average of 65 s degree@xmath29 for observed sky regions .",
    "about 15% of these observations were taken using the 10% shutter aperture .",
    "the s - band exposure map is similar to the l - band map , although coverage is reduced due to the smaller field of view .    in order to obtain true images of the cosmic fuv sky , these data were subject to further reduction to account for artifacts , evident when simply dividing the photon map by the exposure map , and to account for detector background noise contribution . we proceed with artifact removal and analysis of the _ spear _ l - band map , for 100% shutter - position observations , because of their superior coverage and sensitivity in comparison to the s - band data .",
    "the artifacts , e.g. streaking in the direction of survey sweeps and localized over - intense regions , are due to systematic errors in exposure determination and to the recording of data during times of high airglow or radiation background contamination . over",
    "- intense regions due to erroneous mapping were eliminated by only including orbits that contain exposure records and photons that map to @xmath2895% of the identical sky pixels .",
    "orbits having excessive airglow or particle induced detector noise were identified by using the h lyman-@xmath30 @xmath0 1027 and o i @xmath0 1356 count rates as airglow monitors .",
    "entire orbits with an average lyman-@xmath30 rate exceeding 5 s@xmath17 were eliminated . for certain regions showing residual ecliptic streaking that have been observed repeatedly using successive sweeps , entire orbits were rejected when their average monitor rate exceeded twice the dispersion of all the orbital rates about their median .",
    "the l - band spectral map , after artifact removal , contains 7.2@xmath2610@xmath2 photons and 810 ks of full - field exposure .    to obtain the _ diffuse _ cosmic background , we attempt to remove bright concentrated sources , e.g. resolved stars , from the map . because the fuv diffuse intensity varies by orders of magnitude across the sky , stars must be identified as _ locally _ intense pixels . an l - band total intensity map , integrated over @xmath9 1360  1710 , was adaptively binned by sky area to attain a statistical signal to noise ( s / n ) @xmath3145 , value for each bin .",
    "in this scheme , the sky - bin size is increased along healpix pixel boundaries , i.e. for contiguous pixel groupings of size 4@xmath32 , until sufficient counts exist within the bin . in this way ,",
    "bright objects retain small angular dimensions while faint regions are averaged to larger angular dimensions with values of improved significance .",
    "bright sources were identified in @xmath53% of the pixels as having an intensity that exceeds 2.5 times the median value of the enveloping 4@xmath334@xmath7 region ( 256 healpix bins ) .",
    "( we did not attempt to identify stars using point - spread function detection schemes in this preliminary work because , at each point in the sky , the mapped point - spread function is a composite of the elliptical instrumental spread - function whose orientation differs for each sweep direction . )    the first galactic map of total diffuse @xmath34 l - band fuv flux , shown in figure 2 , is obtained as an end product of the data reduction by eliminating the locally intense pixels from the starting continuum map , followed by adaptively binning the pixels to s / n @xmath3110 .",
    "the diffuse fuv l - band sky map ( figure 2 ) shows the largest intensity toward the galactic plane and other regions where bright early type stars co - exist with significant columns of interstellar dust , such as the obvious features of the sco - cen association and the magellanic clouds .",
    "thus , the cosmic fuv flux distribution is consistent with what is is generally believed to be its dominant component , starlight scattered by interstellar dust @xcite , and is therefore similar to maps of reddening , n(hi ) and h-@xmath35 @xcite because both of these maps trace in some way either interstellar dust or the strong ( local ) fuv radiation fields that are required to produce the dust - scattered fuv continuum .",
    "far uv spectra of the sky are obtained by spatially binning the _ spear _ l - band spectral sky - map .",
    "the integrated _ faint - sky _ ( bright - star subtracted ) and _ bright - sky _ ( star - only ) fuv spectra are shown in figure 3 , together with example spectra for the type of stars expected to dominate the direct and scattered stellar fuv background @xcite .",
    "the _ bright - sky _ spectrum has a @xmath9 1360 - 1710 median intensity of @xmath530k cu .",
    "the _ faint - sky _ diffuse spectrum has a band median intensity of 2.3k cu that includes contributions from a true cosmic signal , a combination of direct unresolved and interstellar dust - scattered starlight , and residual instrumental background .    the spectral fitting model of korpela et al .",
    "( _ ibid _ ) is used to identify and estimate the strength of both the astronomical and instrumental components within the _ faint - sky _ signal .",
    "we find a median detector dark - noise contribution of 460 cu , the geo - coronal emission line , oi @xmath0 1356 , and a number of prominent spectral features which we identify as diffuse astrophysical emission lines from the ism .",
    "strong emission lines from abundant interstellar species in this bandpass can typically be identified with confidence because they are usually well separated from each other and from night - time geocoronal lines , although features from unresolved stars or scattered starlight and from interstellar h@xmath3 do add some confusion to the spectrum .",
    "line identifications and intensities of prominent features are shown in table 1 , along with the intensities statistical error ( 10 - 20 % ) and line - fit modeling error .",
    "lines found that are likely to originate from the warm / hot ism include the pronounced civ@xmath9 1549 feature and the oiv]/ siiv@xmath9 1400/1403 blend , previously detected and tentatively identified , respectively , by @xcite at similar intensities .",

    "we identify the feature at 1639.1  as heii @xmath0 1640 diffuse emission , although the fit line width , 50% larger than other identified features , indicates spectral contamination from h@xmath3 or from oi airglow , although the night - time only observations mitigates potential oi contamination .",
    "some spectral features appear in both the _ bright - sky _ and the _ faint - sky _ spectra , such as those at @xmath0 1485 and @xmath0 1520 , which we tentatively attribute to residual stellar features and some possible contribution from the h@xmath3 fluorescence bands .",
    "the total intensity estimated for all of the prominent interstellar atomic spectral lines is @xmath510k lu , and for the distinct h@xmath3 fluorescence bands is @xmath59k lu .",
    "these fuv continuum and emission line data contain much astrophysical information .",
    "the continuum distribution depends upon the interstellar dust and radiation field , the fluorescence reveals the molecular distribution and destruction rate , and the fuv emission lines indicate the ionization equilibrium state and energetics of the ism .",

    "<S> the spectroscopy of plasma evolution from astrophysical radiation ( or the far - ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) instruments , flown aboard the stsat-1 satellite mission , have provided the first large - area spectral mapping of the cosmic far ultraviolet ( fuv , @xmath0 900 - 1750 ) background . </S>",
    "<S> we observe diffuse radiation from hot ( 10@xmath1  10@xmath2 k ) and ionized plasmas , molecular hydrogen , and dust scattered starlight . </S>",
    "<S> these data provide for the unprecedented detection and discovery of spectral emission from a variety of interstellar environments , including the general medium , molecular clouds , supernova remnants , and super - bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the mission and its data , present an overview of the diffuse fuv sky s appearance and spectrum , and introduce the scientific findings detailed later in this volume . </S>"
