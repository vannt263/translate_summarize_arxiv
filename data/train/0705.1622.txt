    "three - dimensional models for flat galaxies were obtained by miyamoto and nagai @xcite and satoh @xcite ; de zeeuw and pfenniger @xcite presented a sequence of infinite triaxial potential - density pairs relevant for galaxies with massive haloes of different shapes . long and murali @xcite derived simple potential - density pairs for a prolate and a triaxial bar by softening a thin needle with a spherical potential and a miyamoto and nagai potential , respectively . see @xcite for a discussion on other galactic models .",
    "there also exist several general relativistic models of disks , e.  g. , @xcite@xcite .",
    "a general relativistic version of the miyamoto and nagai models was studied by vogt and letelier @xcite .",
    "although axial symmetry is a common approximation to many disk galactic models , recent statistics of bulges of disk galaxies ( s0sd ) have revealed that nearly half of them are box- and peanut- shaped @xcite .",
    "about 4% of all galaxies with box- and peanut- shaped bulges have so called `` thick boxy bulges '' : they are box shaped and are large with respect to the diameters of their galaxies @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider two simple triaxial potential - density pairs whose mass density distributions are box - shaped along one axis .",
    "the first is constructed by applying on each cartesian coordinate a transformation similar to that used by miyamoto and nagai ; this is done in subsection [ sub_sec1 ] .",
    "the second pair is a triaxial generalization of one studied by satoh , and is presented in subsection [ sub_sec2 ] . in section [ sec_2 ] some orbits for the miyamoto and nagai - like triaxial potential are exhibited .",
