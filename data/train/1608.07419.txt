    "understanding the nonlinear response of dense colloidal systems to shear or other mechanical driving forces on a microscopic ( i.e. , particle - resolved ) level has become a focus of growing interest .",
    "recent examples include density excitations ( determining frictional properties ) in driven colloidal monolayers @xcite , the stick - slip motion involved in the transmission of torque in driven colloidal clutches @xcite , as well as heterogeneities @xcite , and diverging stress- and strain correlations @xcite in sheared colloidal glasses .",
    "related complex microscopic behavior occurs in sheared granular matter @xcite .",
    "developing a microscopic understanding of such shear - induced behavior is interesting not only in the general context of nonequilibrium behavior of soft - matter systems , but also is crucial for applications in nanotribology , the design of novel materials and of efficient nanomachines .    in the present paper we are concerned with the shear - induced microscopic response of thin films of spherical colloidal particles between two planar walls ( slit - pore geometry ) .",
    "by using brownian dynamics ( bd ) computer simulations and an analytical approach , we aim at understanding transport mechanisms under shear for both , mono- and bidisperse systems .    the structural behavior of colloidal suspensions in presence of spatial confinement is nontrivial already in equilibrium ; in particular , it is well established that the particles spontaneously form layers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) which , moreover , become crystal - like ( `` capillary freezing '' ) in lateral directions at sufficiently high densities @xcite .",
    "exposing such highly correlated systems to shear flow ( along a direction within the plane of the walls ) leads to a breakdown of crystalline in - plane ordering after overcoming a `` critical '' shear rate , and a subsequent recrystallization at higher shear rates , as both computer simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite reveal . in two earlier publications @xcite",
    "we have analyzed this behavior in detail , for the exemplary case of a colloidal bilayer ( of monodisperse particles ) under constant shear rate @xcite or constant stress @xcite ( both of these external control strategies can be experimentally realized ) .",
    "one main conclusion was that the breakdown of crystalline order is related to `` depinning '' transitions in terms of the layer velocity from a locked into a running ( sliding ) state @xcite . in this sense , the dynamical behavior of confined colloidal layers under shear bears strong similarities to the well - studied case of one - dimensional ( 1d ) particle chains or two - dimensional ( 2d ) particle monolayers driven over a periodic substrate @xcite .",
    "inspired by this similarity , we here propose an analytical model which allows to predict the shear - induced depinning on the basis of the structure in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the model is essentially a variant of the well - known frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model @xcite , which has been extensively used to model friction between solid ( atomic or colloidal ) surfaces and has also proven to be crucial for understanding driven monolayers @xcite",
    ". it should be stressed , however , that despite all similarities , there is one crucial difference between our system and the case of driven monolayers : in the latter case , the periodic substrate represents a fixed _ external field _ , whereas in our case , the `` substrate '' rather corresponds to a neighboring layer which can respond to the shear flow itself by in- and out - of - plane deformations .",
    "indeed , one main goal of the present study is to elucidate the implications of this difference .",
    "a further major goal is to explore the impact of incommensurability , that is , a mismatch of structural length scales , in our sheared system . to this end",
    "we consider an asymmetric system where a layer of small colloids is sheared with respect to ( crystalline ) layers of larger particles .",
    "as expected from the fk model as well as from previous , experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of driven monolayers , we observe moving defect structures with locally enhanced density ( `` kinks '' ) or locally reduced density ( `` antikinks '' ) . these kinks and antikinks",
    "correspond to soliton solutions of the continuum version of the fk model ( i.e. , the sine - gordon equation ) .",
    "contrary to the theoretically predicted scenario , however , in our system only the kinks participate in the particle transport , whereas the antikinks remain essentially `` locked '' within the moving layer .",

    "[ fig : voronoi configuration ] , we find that the true structure in the top layer is characterized by a substantial amount of defects . specifically , one observes both , cells with enhanced area relative to the ideal case ( corresponding to a smaller - than - average local density ) and cells with reduced area ( corresponding to a locally increased density ) . in analogy to the 1d fk model we call these defects `` antikinks '' ( @xmath143 ) and `` kink '' ( @xmath144 ) @xcite , respectively . in the original fk model , the kinks ( antikinks )",
    "imply that there is more than ( less than ) one particle per lattice side @xcite . here",

    "inspecting now the top layer distribution we observe , at @xmath68 , that @xmath151 still has a maximum at @xmath152 .",
    "however , there are also pronounced , asymmetric flanks , corresponding to particles in kinks ( @xmath144 ) and antikinks ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "we note that the left - hand flank is bounded by the tightest possible packing of small colloids .",
    "this explains the rapid decrease of the number of particles with @xmath153 . such a limitation does not exist for the number of antikinks , which explains the much broader shape of @xmath151 at the right side .",
    "considering now the impact of shear , we observe , first , a progressive decrease and finally , a disappearance , of the maximum of @xmath151 at @xmath149 .",
    "this reflects the decrease of the number of particles with local quadratic order . at the same time , the number of particles involved in kinks and antikinks increases .",

    "the number of kinks with similar values of the local density increases with @xmath39 .",
    "this is in contrast to the antikinks , whose area distribution increases mainly in width , corresponding to an increasing size of defect structures with multiple missing particles . finally ,",
    "for shear rates beyond the critical shear rate ( @xmath154 ) of the idealized ( crystalline ) top layer ( given by eq .",

    "in other words , the waiting time @xmath155 ( defined according to the `` minimum - based '' definition in @xcite ) is larger than the brownian timescale @xmath156 characterizing the diffusion of the free small particle over the distance @xmath157 . on increasing @xmath39 , the jumps become more frequent , as expected due to the stronger drive which helps to overcome the `` barriers '' generated by the bottom layers .",
    "this is also reflected by the distribution of the waiting times [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : single particle trajectories]b ) ] , whose maximum shifts to shorter times for increasing shear rates . at this point",
    "we recall the increase of the number of kinks with @xmath39 discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : structural properties ] . having this in mind ,",
    "the enhancement of the jump frequency ( i.e. , @xmath158 ) may be taken as an indication that the jumping particle is part of a kink .",
    "we also note that , in contrast to the fk model , the particles in the present system can jump multiple lattice sides at once .",
    "clearly ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : single particle trajectories ] ) this becomes more likely for large shear rates ( e.g. @xmath159 ) .    ) . ]    in addition to tracking single particles , we have also investigated the motion of defect structures ( kinks and antikinks ) involving several particles .",
    "an example of this analysis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : voronoi configuration dynamics ] , where a section of the top layer is plotted at four different times .",
    "the series clearly reveals the motion of a kink in @xmath12-direction .",
    "this kink is tracked via a modified hoshen - kopelman algorithm , which identifies clusters with enhanced local density ( i.e. , @xmath144 ) on the underlying triangular lattice given by the delaunay triangulation .",
    "for antikinks , the same approach is used to track clusters with reduced local density ( i.e. , @xmath143 ) .",
    "the tracking of the positions of the kinks and antikinks furthermore allows us to calculate their average velocity relative to the bottom layers in @xmath12-direction .",

    ", we have included the average relative velocity of the top layer . in equilibrium ( i.e. , @xmath68 )",
    ", the kinks display no net motion just like the top layer .",

    "this holds for all shear rates considered , however , the difference ( more specifically , the ratio @xmath161 ) is largest in the range @xmath162 . here",
    "the velocity of the kinks is nearly one order of magnitude larger than the velocity of the top layer .",
    "this observation is in accordance with a prediction from the fk model , where the monolayer is displaced exactly one lattice side when a single kink travels through the layer @xcite , i.e. , @xmath163 with @xmath164 the number of kinks and @xmath70 the number of particles in the monolayer . therefore ,",
    "if there is only a small number of kinks , the velocity of the layer is expected to be much slower than the velocity of the kinks .",
    "we will come back to this point in the subsequent section [ sec : estimate average motion via local dynamics ] . increasing the shear rate leads to a corresponding increase of the number of kinks",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : voronoi cell area histogram ] ) . as a consequence",
    "the difference between the velocities decreases .",
    "in contrast to the kinks , the antikinks seem to be `` locked '' within the top layer as revealed both by the direct visualization in fig .",
    "[ fig : voronoi configuration dynamics ] and by the fact that their average velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : relative velocity density excitations ] ) is nearly identical to that of the top layer .",
    "this `` locking '' behavior of the antikinks is in contrast to the ( original ) fk model , where the antikinks move with a velocity which is the same in magnitude , but opposite in direction to that of the kinks .",
    "the reason for the antikink motion in the fk model is the attractive harmonic interaction potential linking the particles @xcite . in driven monolayers with purely repulsive interactions ,",
    "the magnitude of the velocity of the antikinks is expected to be smaller than that of the kinks @xcite but still different from the average motion of the layer .    in our system",
    ", the antikinks apparently move _ along _ the direction of the driving force , which can not be explained by the absence of attractive interactions alone .",
    "instead , we interpret this phenomena as a result of the the fact that , in our system , the `` substrate '' acts not as an _ external _ potential , but as a part of the layered system which responds to the behavior of the top layer . indeed , we find that the large particles of the bottom layer shift to higher @xmath14-positions in the vicinity of the antikinks .",
    "in other words , the reduced local density in the top layer leads to a bump formed by the bottom particles .",

    "motivated by the corresponding formula in the fk model [ see eq .",

    ", we observe significant deviations . here , the top layer is completely melted and the system displays collective motion of the particles in large density waves .",
    "this is obviously strongly different from the transport mechanism of kinks .",
    "finally , in comparison to the fk model , we find that the factor of proportionality ( @xmath171 ) is weakly shear - rate dependent , corresponding to a small thermal drift of the top layer .",
    "however , especially for small shear rates , this drift can be neglected , reflecting that kinks are indeed the dominant transport mechanism .",
    "using bd simulations and an analytical approach we have studied the dynamical behavior of three types of colloidal films under planar shear flow . focusing on high densities and strong confinement , where the colloids arrange in two or three layers with ( squarelike ) crystalline order ,",
    "the shear - induced dynamical behavior is similar to that of colloidal monolayers driven over a periodic substrate potential @xcite . in particular",
    ", the symmetric ( one - component ) bilayer system displays a depinning transition , where the layers are `` pinned '' to each other up to a critical shear rate @xcite .",
    "a similar depinning transition is also observed for the symmetric ( one - component ) trilayer system .",
    "interestingly , this does not hold for the asymmetric ( two - component ) trilayer system , which is characterized by a mismatch of the effective lattice constants in the top and the two bottom layers . in this system ,",
    "the top layer is never fully pinned , rather we observe the formation of kinklike defects reminiscent of the fk model @xcite .    from a conceptual point of view ,",
    "one key result of our study is that the dynamics of the symmetric systems can be mapped to the motion of a single particle driven over an effective periodic substrate potential .",
    "the resulting effective model can be solved analytically and yields a prediction of the critical shear rate for the depinning transition . for the bilayer system ,",
    "both the resulting average velocity of the layers and the shear stress are in good qualitative agreement with the bd simulation results .",
    "further , the mapping procedure reveals the relation between the critical shear rate and important system parameters such as the strength of the pair interactions and the width of the confinement . for the symmetric trilayer system ,",
    "the critical shear rate is overestimated in the sense that the effective model can not describe the laned state which occurs in the real system between the crystalline and the melted state .",
    "still , the model predicts nearly correctly the onset of melting .",
    "another main result of our study is the observation of local transport via kinklike density excitations in the asymmetric trilayer system . for small shear rates ,",
    "the kinks provide the main mechanism for particle transport in the top layer .",
    "the average velocity of the layer is then proportional to their average velocity times the number of kinks .",
    "the factor of proportionality is weakly shear rate dependent , which we interpret as a small thermal drift due to the noise .",
    "interestingly , the antikink - like defects do not contribute to the particle transport , rather they are stationary relative to the top layer .",
    "this is in contrast to the fk model and can be explained by deformations of the bottom layers in response to the locally reduced density in the top layer .",
    "similar to previous studies @xcite , we here employed a set of system parameters pertaining to a realistic system of charged silica particles @xcite .",
    "thus , our predictions can , in principle , be tested by experiments . in this context",
    "we note that the presence of a solvent can induce hydrodynamic interactions between the colloidal particles , which are neglected in our model .",
    "considering experimental studies confirming the solidlike response of strongly confined fluids @xcite and local transport via kinklike defect structures @xcite , we expect these interactions to affect the timescales , but not the overall behavior of the system .",
    "in addition to a direct comparison to experiments , it would be very interesting to investigate the shear - induced dynamics of confined films for wall distances corresponding to a hexagonal or disordered equilibrium configuration as well as the dynamics of thicker binary crystalline films @xcite .",
