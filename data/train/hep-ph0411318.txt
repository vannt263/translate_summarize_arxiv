    "<S> we calculate cross sections and asymmetries for slepton pair production through neutral and charged electroweak currents in polarized hadron collisions for general slepton masses and including mixing of the left- and right - handed interaction eigenstates relevant for third generation sleptons . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical results confirm and extend a previous calculation . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , we show that measurements of the longitudinal single - spin asymmetry at the existing polarized @xmath0 collider rhic and at possible polarization upgrades of the tevatron or the lhc would allow for a determination of the tau slepton mixing angle and/or the associated supersymmetry breaking parameters @xmath1 for gauge mediation and @xmath2 for minimal supergravity . furthermore , the standard model background from tau pair production can be clearly distinguished due to the opposite sign of the associated asymmetry .    </S>",
