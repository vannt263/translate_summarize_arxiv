    "a random graph is a set of nodes that are randomly joined by links . when there are sufficiently many links , a connected component containing a finite fraction of all nodes , the so - called giant component , emerges .",

    "a random graph is also the most natural mean - field model of percolation @xcite . in computer science , satisfiability , in its simplest form , maps onto a random graph @xcite .",
    "additionally , random graphs are used to model social networks @xcite .",
    "random graphs have been analyzed largely using combinatorial and probabilistic methods @xcite .",
    "an alternative statistical physics methodology is kinetic theory , or equivalently , the rate equation approach .",
    "the formation of connected components from disconnected nodes can be treated as a dynamic aggregation process @xcite .",
    "this kinetic approach was used to derive primarily the size distribution of components @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that structural characteristics of random graphs can be analyzed using the rate equation approach @xcite . in this study , we present a comprehensive treatment of paths and cycles in evolving random graphs .",
    "the rate equation approach is formulated by treating linking as a dynamic aggregation process .",
    "this approach allows an analytic calculation of the path length distribution .",
    "since a cycle is formed when two connected nodes are linked , the path length distribution yields the cycle length distribution .",
    "more subtle statistical properties of cycles in random graphs can be calculated as well .",
    "in particular , the probability that the system contains no cycles and the size distribution of the first , second , etc .",
    "cycles are obtained analytically .",
    "we focus on the behavior near and at the phase transition point , namely , when the gel forms .",
    "we show that the path and the cycle length distribution approach self - similar distributions near the gelation transition . at the gelation point , these distributions develop algebraic tails .",
    "the exact results obtained for an infinite system allow us to deduce scaling laws for finite systems . using heuristic and extreme statistics arguments , the size of the giant component at the gelation point is obtained .",
    "this size scale characterizes the size distribution of components and it leads to a number of scaling laws for the typical path size and cycle size .",
    "extensive numerical simulations validate these scaling laws for finite systems .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , the evolving random graph process is introduced ( sec .",
    "ii ) , and then the size distribution of all components is analyzed in sec .",
    "statistical properties of paths are derived in sec .",
    "iv and then used to obtain statistical properties of all cycles ( sec .",

    "a graph is a collection of nodes joined by links . in a random graph ,",
    "links are placed randomly .",
    "random graphs may be realized in a number of ways .",
    "the links may be generated instantaneously ( static graph ) or sequentially ( evolving graph ) ; additionally a given pair of nodes may be connected by at most a single link ( simple graph ) or by multiple links ( multi - graph ) .",
    "we consider the following version of the random graph model .",
    "initially , there are @xmath3 disconnected nodes",
    ". then , a pair of nodes is selected at random and a link is placed between them ( fig .",
    "[ fig - rg ] ) .",
    "this linking process continues ad infinitum and it creates an evolving random graph . the process is realized dynamically .",
    "links are generated with a constant rate in time , set equal to @xmath4 without loss of generality .",
    "there are no restrictions associated with the identity of the two nodes .",
    "a pair of nodes may be selected multiple times , i.e. , a multi - graph is created .",
    "additionally , the two nodes need not be different , so self - connections are allowed .    at time @xmath5",
    ", the total number of links is on average @xmath6 , the average number of links per node ( the degree ) is @xmath5 , and the average number of self - connections per node is @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , whether or not self - connections are allowed is a secondary issue .",
    "since the linking process is completely random , the degree distribution is poissonian with a mean equal to @xmath5 .",
    "the evolving random graph model has several virtues that simplify the analysis .",
    "first , the linking process is completely random as there is no memory of previous links .",
    "second , having at hand a continuous variable ( time ) allows us to use continuum methods , particularly the rate equation approach .",
    "this is best demonstrated by determination of the size distribution of connected components .    as linking proceeds , connected components form .",
    "when a link is placed between two distinct components , the two components join .",
    "for example , the latest link in fig .",
    "[ fig - rg ] joins two components of size @xmath8 and @xmath9 into a component of size @xmath10 . generally , there are @xmath11 ways to join disconnected components .",
    "hence , components undergo the following aggregation process @xmath12 two components aggregate with a rate proportional to the product of their sizes .",
    "let @xmath13 be the density of components containing @xmath1 nodes at time @xmath5 . in terms of @xmath14 , the total number of components with @xmath1 nodes , then @xmath15 . for finite random graphs ,",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath13 are random variables , but in the @xmath16 limit the density @xmath13 becomes a deterministic quantity .",
    "it evolves according to the _ nonlinear _ rate equation ( the explicit time dependence is dropped for simplicity ) @xmath17 the initial condition is @xmath18 .",
    "the gain term accounts for components generated by joining two smaller components whose sizes sum up to @xmath1 .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ck - eq ] ) represents loss due to linking of components of size @xmath1 to other components . the corresponding gain and",
    "loss rates follow from the aggregation rule ( [ agg ] ) .",
    "the rate equations can be solved using a number of techniques . throughout this investigation",
    ", we use a convenient method in which the time dependence is eliminated first . solving the rate equations",
    "recursively yields @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , etc .",
    "these explicit results suggest that @xmath22 . substituting this form into ( [ ck - eq ] ) , we find that the coefficients @xmath23 satisfy the recursion relation @xmath24 subject to @xmath25 .",
    "this recursion is solved using the generating function approach .",
    "the form of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ck - eq ] ) suggests to utilize the generating function of the sequence @xmath26 rather than @xmath23 , i.e. , .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ ck - eq ] ) by @xmath27 and summing over all @xmath1 , we find that the generating function satisfies the nonlinear ordinary differential equation @xmath28 integrating this equation , @xmath29 and using the asymptotics @xmath30 as @xmath31 fixes the constant @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we arrive at an implicit solution for the generating function @xmath33 the coefficients @xmath23 can be extracted from ( [ gz ] ) via the lagrange inversion formula , or using contour integration as detailed in appendix a. substituting @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ ak ] ) yields @xmath35 reproducing the well - known result for the size distribution @xcite @xmath36    in the following , we shall often use the generating function for the size distribution @xmath37 .",
    "this generating function is readily expressed via the auxiliary generating function @xmath38 : @xmath39    let us consider the fraction of nodes in finite components , @xmath40 .",
    "this quantity is merely the first moment of the size distribution ( hence the notation ) .",
    "equivalently @xmath41 . from ( [ czt ] )",
    "we find @xmath42 with @xmath43 . using ( [ gz ] ) , we express @xmath44 through @xmath5 : @xmath45 for @xmath46 , there is a single root @xmath47 , and all nodes reside in finite components , @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath49 the physical root satisfies @xmath50 and only a fraction of the nodes resides in finite components , @xmath51 .",
    "thus , at time @xmath52 , the system undergoes a gelation transition with a finite fraction of the nodes contained in infinite components .",
    "we term this time the gelation time , @xmath53 . in the late stages of the evolution @xmath54",
    ", one has @xmath55 and @xmath56 , so the system consists of a single giant component and a small number of isolated nodes .",
    "the behavior at and near the transition point are of special interest .",
    "the critical behavior of the component size distribution is echoed by other quantities as will be shown below .",
    "size distributions become algebraic near the critical point .",
    "moreover , there is a self - similar behavior as a function of time ( dynamical scaling ) and as a function of the system size ( finite - size scaling ) .",

    "[ throughout this paper , bold letters are used for critical distributions , so @xmath59 . ] in the vicinity of the gelation time , the size distribution is self - similar , @xmath60 with the scaling function @xmath61 thus , the characteristic component size diverges near the gelation point , @xmath62 .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we applied kinetic theory to an infinite system .",
    "this approach can be extended to finite systems .",
    "unfortunately , such treatments are very cumbersome @xcite . since the number of components is finite , the fluctuations are no longer negligible , and instead of a deterministic rate equation approach , a stochastic approach is needed . here we follow an alternative path , employing the exact infinite system results in conjunction with scaling and extreme statistics arguments .",
    "the characteristic size of components at the gelation point exhibits nontrivial dependence on the system size .",
    "this is conveniently seen via the cumulative size distribution .",
    "the size of the largest component in the system , @xmath63 , is estimated from the extreme statistics criterion , @xmath64 , to be @xmath65 the largest component in the system grows sub - linearly with the system size @xcite .",
    "the time by which this component emerges approaches unity for large enough systems as follows from the diverging characteristic size scale @xmath66 , @xmath67    the maximal component size ( [ kg ] ) underlies the entire size distribution .",
    "let @xmath68 be the size distribution in a system of size @xmath3 at time @xmath5 .",
    "at the gelation point , the size distribution @xmath69 obeys the finite - size scaling form ( figs .",
    "[ fig - ckn ] and [ fig - fss ] ) @xmath70 the scaling function has the following extremal behaviors @xmath71    the small-@xmath72 behavior corresponds to sizes well below the characteristic size and thus reflects the infinite system behavior ( [ ckg ] ) .",
    "the large-@xmath72 behavior was obtained numerically with @xmath73 . to appreciate the large-@xmath72 asymptotic ,",
    "let us estimate the probability that the system managed to generate the largest possible component of size @xmath74 at time @xmath52 .",
    "the lower bound for this probability can be established via a `` greedy '' evolution which assumes that after @xmath1 linking events the graph is composed of a tree of size @xmath75 and @xmath76 disconnected nodes .",
    "such evolution occurs with probability @xmath77 that scales as @xmath78 .",
    "while this lower bound is not necessarily optimal , it suggests that the actual probability is exponentially small .",
    "the scaling variable @xmath79 becomes @xmath80 for @xmath81 , so @xmath82 matches the probability @xmath83 when @xmath84 .",
    "versus @xmath1 for various @xmath3 .",

    "@xmath74 links are placed randomly and sequentially among the @xmath3 nodes as follows .",
    "a node is drawn randomly , and then another node is drawn randomly .",
    "last , these two nodes are linked .",
    "self - connections are therefore allowed .",
    "the simulations differ slightly from the above random graph model in that the number of links is not a stochastic variable . for large @xmath3 , this simulation is faithful to the evolving random graph model because the number of links is self - averaging .",
    "the simulation results are consistent with the postulated finite - size scaling form ( [ ckn ] ) .",
    "we note that the scaling function @xmath86 converges slowly as a function of @xmath3 .",

    "a very similar shoulder has been observed for the degree distribution of finite random networks generated by preferential attachment @xcite .",
    "structural characteristics of components can be investigated in a similar fashion . by definition ,",
    "every two nodes in a component are connected . in other words , there is a _ path _ consisting of adjacent links between two such nodes .",
    "we investigate statistical properties of paths in components .",
    "characterization of paths yields useful information regarding the connectivity of components as well as internal structures such as cycles .    for every node in the graph , there are ( generally ) multiple paths that connect it with all other nodes in the respective component . with new links , new paths are formed . for every pair of paths of lengths @xmath89 and @xmath90 originating at two separate nodes , a new path is formed as follows @xmath91 in fig .",
    "[ fig - rg ] , linking two paths of respective lengths @xmath92 and @xmath93 generates a path of length @xmath94 .",
    "thus , paths also undergo an aggregation process . however , this aggregation process is simpler than ( [ agg ] ) because the aggregation rate is independent of the path length .",

    "the initial condition is @xmath99 .",
    "this rate equation reflects the uniform aggregation rate .",
    "another notable feature is the lack of a loss term  once a path is created , it remains forever .",

    "the path length density is @xmath102 indeed , this expression satisfies both the rate equation and the initial condition . the first quantity @xmath100 is consistent with the facts that the link density is equal to @xmath103 and that every link corresponds to two distinct paths of length one .",
    "the above path density represents an aggregate over all nodes and all components .",
    "characterization of path statistics in a component of a given size is achieved via @xmath104 , the density of paths of length @xmath0 in components of size @xmath1 .",
    "note the obvious length bounds @xmath105 and the sum rule @xmath106 reflecting that there are @xmath107 distinct paths in a component of size @xmath1 ( every pair of nodes is connected ) .",
    "the density of the linkless paths is @xmath108 , because @xmath109 is the probability that a node belongs to a component of size @xmath1 .",
    "we have seen that components and paths form via the aggregation processes ( [ agg ] ) and ( [ path ] ) , respectively .",
    "the joint distribution @xmath104 therefore undergoes a bi - aggregation process @xcite . in the present case , @xmath110 where the first index corresponds to the path length and the second to the component size .",

    "for example , substituting the gelation time @xmath150 into the total number of paths @xmath151 yields @xmath152 .",
    "each component has a certain number of nodes and links .",
    "the complexity of a component is defined as the number of links minus the number of nodes . components with complexity @xmath153 are trees ; components with complexity @xmath154 and @xmath155 are termed unicyclic and bicyclic correspondingly .",
    "finite components are predominantly trees .",
    "we have seen that the overall number of links is proportional to @xmath3 and that the overall the number of self - links is of the order unity .",
    "the overall numbers of trees and of unicyclic components mirror this behavior . generally , the number of components of complexity @xmath156 is proportional to @xmath157 ( this result is well - known , see e.g. @xcite and especially @xcite ) .",

    "each unicyclic component contains a single cycle .",
    "cycles are an important characteristic of a graph @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we analyze cycles and unicyclic components using the rate equation approach .",
    "we first note that cycles in random graphs were also studied using various other approaches : janson @xcite employs probabilistic and combinatorial techniques ; marinari and monasson @xcite assign an ising spin to each node and deduce certain properties of loops from the partition function of the ising model ; burda _ et al _ @xcite modify a random graph model to favor the creation of short cycles , and examine the model using a diagrammatic technique .",
