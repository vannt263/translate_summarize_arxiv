    "thurston introduced the * skinning map * as a tool for locating hyperbolic structures on certain closed 3-manifolds , an integral part of his celebrated proof of the hyperbolization theorem for haken manifolds  @xcite .",
    "apart from a class of simple cases , explicit examples of skinning maps remain unexplored .",
    "one reason for this is that the skinning map uses the deformation theory of ahlfors and bers to pass back and forth from a conformal structure on the boundary of a 3-manifold to a hyperbolic structure on its interior . like the uniformization theorem of riemann surfaces , an explicit formula for",
    "the resulting map is typically out of reach .",
    "let @xmath0 be an orientable compact 3-manifold with nonempty incompressible boundary @xmath3 , such that the interior of @xmath0 admits a geometrically finite hyperbolic structure .",
    "given a point @xmath4 in the teichmller space of @xmath5 , the 3-manifold @xmath0 has a quasi - fuchsian cover with @xmath6 on one side and @xmath7 on the other , where @xmath8 indicates a reversal of orientation .",
    "the skinning map of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , is given by @xmath10 .",
    "thurston s key result about skinning maps is the bounded image theorem : if @xmath0 is acylindrical , then @xmath11 is contained in a compact set .",
    "thurston described how to locate hyperbolic structures on a class of closed haken 3-manifolds by iteration of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ` gluing map ' , an isometry from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "there are further questions , and results , about ` how effectively ' iteration of @xmath12 locates fixed points .",
    "@xcite shows that the diameter of the image of @xmath9 is controlled by constants depending only on the volume of @xmath0 and the topology of @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath0 is without rank-1 cusps  @xcite shows that @xmath9 is non - constant .",
    "this result has an improvement in  @xcite , which shows that @xmath9 is open and finite - to - one .",
    "the only example for which there is an explicit formula for @xmath9 is when @xmath0 is an interval bundle over a surface , in which case @xmath9 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "thus it is consistent with the current literature to ask :    * are skinning maps necessarily diffeomorphisms onto their images ?",
    "* are they necessarily immersions ?    in this paper , we present a negative answer to these questions .",
    "the reader should note that we work in the category of pared 3-manifolds and hyperbolic structures with rank-1 cusps .",
    "this allows low - dimensional calculations , in which @xmath9 is ` simply ' a holomorphic map @xmath16 .",
    "there exists a pared 3-manifold @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a genus-2 handlebody and @xmath19 consists of two rank-1 cusps , whose skinning map @xmath9 is not one - to - one and has a critical point .",
    "[ thm ]    briefly , the proof of theorem [ thm ] uses an orientation - reversing isometry of @xmath0 to conclude that the skinning map sends a certain real 1-dimensional submanifold of @xmath15 to itself .",
    "a parametrization of this line by extremal length shows that this restricted map is not one - to - one , and hence the skinning map has a critical point .",
    "that is , this proof produces a ( real ) 1-parameter path of quasi - fuchsian groups @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are both contained in a line in @xmath15 , such that @xmath23 is injective and @xmath24 is not .    by passing to finite covers of the manifold from theorem [ thm ] , this example implies a family of examples of skinning maps with critical points , on teichmller spaces of arbitrarily high dimension .",

    "[ cor ]    this work owes a debt of inspiration to numerical experiments developed by dumas - kent  @xcite which suggest the presence of a critical point of the skinning map associated to the manifold in theorem [ thm ] .",
    "their work also examines some other closely related manifolds and skinning maps , at least one of which appears to be a diffeomorphism onto its image .",
    "it would be interesting to have a unified understanding of these different behaviours .",
    "the reader may note that the proof of theorem [ thm ] is only one of existence . it does not identify a critical point ,",
    "determine the number of critical points , or determine any local degrees of @xmath9 near critical points .",
    "however , for this skinning map there is some evidence of a unique simple critical point in the experiments of dumas - kent .",
    "numerical tools developed by the author support this observation , and , curiously , suggest that the critical point occurs where @xmath0 has hexagonal convex core boundary ( that is , as a point in moduli space the convex core boundary is isomorphic to the poincar metric on @xmath34 ) .",
    "this would seem to imply some geometrical significance to the critical point , which remains elusive .    in  [ background ] , we introduce background and notation .",
    "the proof that critical points of skinning maps persist under certain finite covers is found in  [ finite covers ] . in ",
