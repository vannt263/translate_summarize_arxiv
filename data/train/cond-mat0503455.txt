    "the presence of multiple time and length scales constitutes one of the major problems in computer simulations of matter . in simulations that faithfully capture the dynamic evolution of a system , the fastest particles in the system",
    "dictate the required time resolution .",
    "if different types of particles with widely varying diffusion rates are present , then the slower particles may be unable to explore the entire configuration space during the course of the simulation , leading to ergodicity problems .    in the computational study of complex fluids , such as colloidal suspensions ,",
    "this problem frequently occurs , since such systems typically contain particles of different sizes .",
    "a concrete example is the ` nanoparticle haloing ' phenomenon discovered by lewis and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "this experimental work deals with a new approach to the stabilization of suspensions of micron - sized spherical particles , which tend to aggregate under the influence of their mutual van der waals attraction . conventional approaches to prevent this gelation , such as charge stabilization ( variation of the ph to alter the surface charge of the particles ) , lead to complications in certain applications , e.g. , in the formation of colloidal crystals , where the electrostatic repulsion prevents the close packing of the particles .",
    "it was found that these complications can be avoided by generating an effective colloidal repulsion through the addition of highly - charged nanometer - sized particles to the suspension of the ( near - neutral ) colloids . a concrete explanation for the underlying mechanism leading to the effective repulsions is currently lacking .",
    "evidently , a computational approach to this problem must involve both the microspheres and the nanoparticles , which typically differ by a factor  100 in diameter .",
    "traditionally , the effective pair interaction between colloids ( potential of mean force ) is then calculated by `` integrating out '' the smaller species , e.g. , by simulating a system containing two spheres at fixed separation embedded in a sea of smaller particles  @xcite . here",
    ", we discuss a new simulation algorithm  @xcite that is capable of explicitly incorporating both species and computing equilibrium properties of the suspension , without suffering from the disparity in time scales .",
    "this algorithm can be viewed as a continuum version of the widely - used cluster algorithms for lattice spin models  @xcite .",
    "equilibrium monte carlo methods are aimed at obtaining static thermodynamic and structural properties by generating system configurations according to the boltzmann distribution .",
    "nonphysical moves may be employed in the underlying markov process , which  in principle  offers an exquisite way to overcome the presence of multiple time scales .",
    "thus , monte carlo algorithms are the method of choice for , e.g. , simulations of critical phenomena and phase transitions . in the context of size - asymmetric fluids ,",
    "collective moves have been devised in which groups of particles are moved simultaneously .",
    "unless these groups are identified in a careful way , which typically involves knowledge about the physical properties of the system , the monte carlo step will entail a large energy change and consequently have only a very small acceptance rate .",
    "thus , while this approach has been used quite successfully in specific situations  @xcite , it typically involves a tunable parameter and can not be generalized in a straightforward fashion .",
    "the situation is rather different for spin models , for which swendsen and wang ( sw )  @xcite introduced a _ cluster algorithm _ in which groups of parallel spins are identified in a probabilistic manner , based upon the fortuin ",
    "kasteleyn mapping of the potts model onto the random - cluster model  @xcite .",
    "these groups can subsequently be flipped independently .",
    "this rejection - free algorithm ( every completed cluster can be flipped without an additional evaluation of the resulting energy difference ) suppresses critical slowing down .",
    "accordingly , its generalization to off - lattice fluids has been a widely - pursued goal . however , the sw algorithm  as well as the even more efficient single - cluster variant introduced by wolff  @xcite  relies on invariance of the hamiltonian under a spin - inversion operation . for a fluid",
    ", this translates into particle ",
    "hole symmetry , which is only obeyed for lattice gases .",
    "consequently , efficient off - lattice cluster algorithms have only been designed for a small number of specific fluid models  @xcite , and it is not clear how these methods can be generalized .",
    "hard - sphere fluids constitute another special case . here every configuration without particle overlaps has the same energy .",
    "dress and krauth  @xcite devised a strategy to create such configurations by means of geometric transformations .",
    "their approach is particularly advantageous in size - asymmetric mixtures , but can not be applied to systems with other interactions without supplementing it with a costly acceptance criterion .",
    "nevertheless , a remarkable feature of this geometric cluster algorithm is that it relies on the invariance of the hamiltonian under geometric operations . here",
    ", we exploit this property to formulate a cluster monte carlo algorithm that is applicable to arbitrary pair potentials without the imposition of an acceptance criterion .",
    "the geometric cluster algorithm as formulated by dress and krauth starts from a configuration of particles , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this configuration is rotated around an arbitrarily chosen pivot .",
    "groups of particles that overlap between the original and the rotated configuration are exchanged between these configurations . in practice , it is more convenient to construct only a single cluster and to carry out a point reflection on the fly  @xcite . for each cluster",
    "a new pivot is chosen .",
    "this constitutes the counterpart of the wolff algorithm for spin models  @xcite . in the presence of a general , isotropic pair potential",
    "@xmath0 the cluster construction proceeds as follows ( cf .",
    "[ fig : geomc ] ) :    1 .",
    "choose a random pivot point .",
    "2 .   choose the first particle  @xmath1 at random and move it from its original position  @xmath2 to its new position  @xmath3 , via a point reflection with respect to the pivot .",
    "3 .   identify all particles that interact with  @xmath1 in its original position or in its new position .",
    "these particles  @xmath4 are considered for a point reflection with respect to the pivot .",
    "this reflection is carried out with a probability @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath8 solely depends on the interaction strength between @xmath1 and  @xmath4 .",
    "4 .   repeat step  3 in an iterative fashion for each particle  @xmath4 that is added to the cluster .",
    "if @xmath4 is moved with respect to the pivot , then all its interacting neighbors that have not yet been added to the cluster are considered for inclusion as well .",
    "the cluster construction is completed once all interacting neighbors have been considered .",
    "it is instructive to compare this prescription to the wolff cluster algorithm , in which a cluster of parallel spins is grown from a randomly chosen initial spin .",
    "parallel spins with a ferromagnetic coupling constant  @xmath9 are added to the cluster with a probability @xmath10 .",
    "the energy difference between the parallel and the antiparallel configuration indeed equals  @xmath11 .",
    "an antiparallel spin is never added to the cluster , in accordance with the fact that such a pair will be in a state of lower energy if only the first spin is flipped .",
    "this algorithm is ergodic , since each particle can be moved over an arbitrarily small distance .",
    "namely , there is a non - vanishing probability that a cluster consists of only a single particle and the pivot can be located arbitrarily close to the center of this particle .",
    "detailed balance is proven by considering a configuration  @xmath12 which is transformed into a new configuration  @xmath13 by means of a cluster move .",
    "the energy change @xmath14 results from every particle that is _ not _ included in the cluster but interacts with one or more particles that are part of the cluster .",
    "each `` broken bond '' has a probability  @xmath15 , so that the total probability of forming a cluster is given by @xmath16 the prefactor @xmath17 accounts for the probability of choosing a specific pivot and for the probability of creating a specific arrangement of bonds inside the cluster .",
    "the total set @xmath18 of broken bonds can be divided into two subsets .",
    "the broken bonds  @xmath19 that lead to an increase @xmath20 in pair energy have a probability @xmath21 , whereas the broken bonds @xmath22 that lead to a decrease in pair energy have a probability equal to unity .",
    "accordingly , the transition probability can be written as @xmath23 \\;.\\ ] ] the reverse move , in which the configuration @xmath13 is transformed into the configuration @xmath12 by moving a cluster that is constructed in the same way , has a probability @xmath24 where the sum runs over the same set @xmath18 of broken bonds as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xy ] ) , but the sign of all energy differences @xmath25 has been reversed ( indicated by @xmath26 ) . accordingly , the sum over @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xy - exp ] ) is replaced by the negative sum over the complementary set @xmath27 , @xmath28 \\;.\\ ] ] the point reflection is a self - inverse operation , so that detailed balance is obeyed without the need to impose an acceptance criterion : @xmath29 =   \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta e_{y})}{\\exp(-\\beta e_{x } ) }   \\;.\\ ] ] since energy differences are taken into account on a pair - wise basis during the construction of the cluster , rather than as a total energy difference after the cluster has been completed , the cluster is constructed in such a way that large energy differences are avoided .",
    "the clusters are representative of the actual structure of the system .      in order to demonstrate that the generalized geometric cluster algorithm ( gca ) indeed constitutes the off - lattice counterpart of the sw and wolff cluster algorithms , it is instructive to formulate a multiple - cluster variant .",
    "this formulation yields a full decomposition of an off - lattice fluid configuration into _ stochastically independent clusters_. in the following , we demonstrate how it can be phrased as a natural extension of the single - cluster version .",
    "first , a cluster is constructed according to the wolff version of the gca , with the exception that the cluster is only _ identified _ ; particles belonging to the cluster are marked but not actually moved .",
    "the chosen pivot will also be used for the construction of all subsequent clusters in this decomposition .",
    "these subsequent clusters are built just like the first cluster , except that particles that are already part of an earlier cluster will never be considered for a new cluster .",
    "once each particle is part of a cluster the decomposition is completed and each cluster is moved with a probability  @xmath30 .",
    "although all clusters except the first are built in a _ restricted _ fashion , every individual cluster is constructed according to the rules of the wolff formulation of the gca .",
    "the exclusion of particles that are already part of another cluster simply reflects the fact that every bond should be considered only once . if a bond is broken during the construction of an earlier cluster it must not be re - established during the construction of a subsequent cluster .    in order to establish that this prescription is a true equivalent of the sw algorithm",
    ", we prove that each cluster can be moved ( reflected ) independently while preserving detailed balance .",
    "if only a single cluster is actually moved , this essentially corresponds to the wolff version of the gca , since each cluster is built according to the gca prescription .",
    "the same holds true if several clusters are moved and no interactions are present between particles that belong to different clusters ( the hard - sphere algorithm is a particular realization of this situation ) . if two or more clusters are moved and broken bonds exist between these clusters , i.e. , a non - vanishing interaction exists between particles that belong to disparate ( moving ) clusters , then the shared broken bonds are actually preserved and the proof of detailed balance provided in the previous section no longer applies in its original form .",
    "however , since these bonds are identical in the forward and reverse move , the corresponding factors cancel out .",
    "this is illustrated for the situation of two clusters whose construction involves , respectively , two sets of broken bonds @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "each set comprises bonds @xmath19 that lead to an _ increase _ in pair energy and bonds @xmath22 that lead to a _ decrease _ in pair energy .",
    "we further subdivide these sets into _ external _ bonds that connect cluster 1 or  2 with the remainder of the system and _ joint _ bonds that connect cluster 1 and  2 .",
    "accordingly , the probability of creating cluster  1 is given by @xmath33 upon construction of the first cluster , the creation of the second cluster has a probability @xmath34 since all joint bonds in @xmath35 already have been broken . the factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 account for the probability of realizing a particular arrangement of internal bonds in clusters 1 and  2 , respectively .",
    "hence , the total transition probability for moving both clusters ( upon fixing the pivot ) is given by @xmath38 \\;.\\ ] ] in the reverse move , the energy differences for all external broken bonds have changed sign , but the energy differences for the joint bonds connecting cluster 1 and  2 are the same as in the forward move .",
    "thus , cluster  1 is created with probability @xmath39        \\prod_{j \\in \\left\\{l_1^{\\rm joint}\\right\\ } } \\exp[-\\beta { { \\mbox{{{\\usefont{u}{psy}{m}{n}d}}}}}_j ] \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath40 reflects the sign change compared to the forward move and the product over the external bonds involves the complement of the set @xmath41 .",
    "the creation probability for the second cluster is @xmath42\\ ] ] and the total transition probability for the reverse move is @xmath43 \\;.\\ ] ] accordingly , detailed balance is still fulfilled , @xmath44 =    \\exp\\left [ - \\beta ( e_y - e_x ) \\right ]   \\;,\\ ] ] in which @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 refer to the total internal energy before and after the move , respectively .",
    "this treatment applies to any simultaneous move of clusters , so that each cluster in the decomposition indeed can be moved independently without violating detailed balance .",
    "it is noteworthy that the probabilities for breaking joint bonds in the forward and reverse moves cancel only because the probability in the cluster construction factorizes into pairwise probabilities , as opposed to the probability for a multiple - particle move in a metropolis - type algorithm .",
    "small ( diameter @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 large particles ( diameter @xmath51 ) at a total packing fraction @xmath52 . @xmath53 and @xmath54 represent the large  large and large  small correlation functions , respectively . ]    as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wolff - sw ] for a binary mixture , the results obtained by means of the multiple - cluster geometric algorithm agree perfectly with those obtained using the single - cluster version .",
    "the most striking feature of the generalized geometric cluster algorithm , apart from the fact that it creates clusters that can be moved in a rejection - free manner , is the speed at which it relaxes size - asymmetric mixtures .",
    "we illustrate this here for a binary fluid mixture consisting of @xmath55 small and @xmath56 large spherical particles with size ratio @xmath57 . the particles are contained in a fixed volume , at equal packing fractions @xmath58 .",
    "while @xmath59 is kept fixed , @xmath55 increases from @xmath60 to @xmath61 as @xmath62 is varied from @xmath63 to  @xmath64 .",
    "pairs of small particles and pairs involving a large and a small particle act like hard spheres .",
    "however , in order to prevent depletion - driven aggregation of the large particles , they have a yukawa repulsion , @xmath65/(r/ \\sigma_{\\rm l } )     & \\quad r >",

    ", @xmath69 rapidly increases with increasing  @xmath62 , because the large particles tend to get trapped by the small particles .",
    "accordingly , an accurate estimate for @xmath69 could only be obtained for @xmath71 . by contrast , the generalized gca has an autocorrelation time that only weakly depends on the size ratio , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : efficiency ] . at @xmath72",
    "the resulting efficiency gain already amounts to more than three orders of magnitude .    .",

    "identical symbols compare to identical temperatures in both panels .",
    "all temperatures are indicated in terms of @xmath76 .",
    "see text for discussion.,title=\"fig : \" ] + ( b )    a crucial limitation of the generalized gca is that each cluster must only occupy a fraction of the entire system .",
    "as observed by dress and krauth  @xcite , the entire system typically will be occupied by a single cluster once the percolation threshold is reached in the combined system containing a configuration and its point - reflected counterpart . for the original system this leads , in three dimensions , to a practical upper limit in the packing fraction around  @xmath77@xmath78 .",
    "this number will vary as a function of size asymmetry and , if additional pair interactions are present , temperature .",
    "it is therefore instructive to study the cluster - size distribution as a function of reduced density  @xmath79 and temperature  @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ fig : density ] illustrates the cluster - size distributions as obtained by means of the multiple - cluster gca for a regular ( one - component ) lennard - jones fluid . in the top panel , @xmath81 .",
    "already at temperatures that are far above the critical temperature  @xmath82 , the cluster - size distribution starts to tend toward a bimodal form , indicative of the formation of large clusters . in the vicinity of the critical temperature",
    ", the average cluster size has become very large . for comparison",
    ", the bottom panel displays the cluster - size distributions at a twice smaller density , @xmath75 . in this case the bimodal shape does not appear until close to  @xmath83 .",
    "the properties suggest that the generalized gca , at least for the one - component lennard - jones fluid , will not suppress critical slowing  the primary advantage of lattice cluster algorithms . for the off - lattice gca ,",
    "this property is less essential , because of the speed - up it delivers for the simulation of size - asymmetric fluids over a wide range of temperatures and packing fractions .",
    "nevertheless , we have investigated the integrated autocorrelation time for the energy at the critical point , as a function of linear system size . in fig .",
    "[ fig : critdyn ] these times are collected for three algorithms .",

    "wang type cluster decompositions .",
    "however , all variants of the gca exhibit the same power - law behavior , which outperforms the metropolis algorithm by a factor @xmath86 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this acceleration may be due to the suppression of the hydrodynamic slowing down  @xcite     as a function of linear system size for a critical lennard - jones fluid , in units of particle sweeps , for three different monte carlo algorithms : local moves ( `` metropolis mc '' ) ; gca with swendsen ",
