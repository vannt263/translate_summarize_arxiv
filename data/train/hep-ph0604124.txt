    "for over two decades , inflation has been a very successful idea . in its earliest days , this success was attributed to the ability for this idea to unite particle physics and cosmology . in the past decade , the success of the inflation idea has been driven by its consistency to observation based on data in particular from precision cmb satellite experiments .",
    "the growing success over the years of the inflation idea has also led to an increasing understanding of the underlying dynamics of inflation . by",
    "now it is known that there are two dynamical realizations of inflation .",
    "one is the original or standard picture , also referred to as isentropic or cold inflation @xcite . in this picture inflationary expansion",
    "occurs with the universe in a supercooled phase which subsequently ends with a reheating period that introduces radiation into the universe .",
    "the fluctuations created during inflation are effectively zero - point ground state fluctuations and the evolution of the inflaton field is governed by a ground state evolution equation . in an alternative class of cold inflation models , inflation has a geometrical origin @xcite with adiabatic density perturbations @xcite .",
    "the other picture of inflation dynamics is nonisentropic or warm inflation @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "inflationary expansion and radiation production occur concurrently .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations created during inflation emerge from some excited statistical state and the evolution of the inflaton has dissipative terms arising from the interaction of the inflaton with other fields .",
    "the dividing point between warm and cold inflation is roughly at @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the radiation energy density present during inflation and @xmath2 is the hubble parameter .",
    "thus @xmath3 is the warm inflation regime and @xmath4 is the cold inflation regime .",
    "this criteria is independent of thermalization , but if such were to occur , one sees this criteria basically amounts to the warm inflation regime corresponding to when @xmath5 .",
    "this is easy to understand since the typical inflaton mass during inflation is @xmath6 and so when @xmath7 , thermal fluctuations of the inflaton field will become important .",
    "this criteria for entering the warm inflation regime turns out to require the dissipation of a very tiny fraction of the inflaton vacuum energy during inflation .",
    "for example , for inflation with vacuum ( _ i.e. _ potential ) energy at the gut scale @xmath8 , in order to produce radiation at the scale of the hubble parameter , which is @xmath9 , it just requires dissipating one part in @xmath10 of this vacuum energy density into radiation .",
    "thus energetically not a very significant amount of radiation production is required to move into the warm inflation regime .",
    "in fact the levels are so small , and their eventual effects on density perturbations and inflaton evolution are so significant , that care must be taken to account for these effects in the analysis of any inflation models .    in this paper",

    "a calculation of inflation for a momomial potential is done , and it is shown that in contrast to cold inflation , in the warm inflation case the mass of the inflaton is bigger than the hubble parameter and the field amplitude is below the planck scale .",

    "the conventional approach @xcite expects the inflaton to start oscillating , which is the precursor to entering various stages of pre / re - heating .",
    "however with account for dissipative effects , this never happens for our example in fig .",
    "[ plot0 ] , since the inflaton remains overdamped till the end when it settles at its minima at @xmath176 .",
    "moreover , throughout inflation , and not just near the end , the inflaton dissipates energy , which yields a radiation component of magnitude @xmath177",
    "the difference between the cold and warm inflationary dynamics implies that the inflaton density perturbations in the two cases also have basic differences . in particular in the warm inflation regime ,",
    "since a thermalized radiation component is present with @xmath178 , inflaton fluctuations are dominantly thermal rather than quantum .",
    "there are two distinct regimes of warm inflation to note .",
    "one is the weak dissipative regime @xcite , @xmath179 and the other is the strong dissipative regime @xcite , @xmath180 for comparison , for cold inflation , where inflaton fluctuations are exclusively quantum @xcite , @xmath181 for both cold and warm inflation , density perturbations are obtained by the same expression , @xmath182 .",
    "the inherent difference in density perturbations in cold versus warm inflation provides a possible direction for distinguishing between these two inflation dynamics using observation . in @xcite",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of density perturbations during warm inflation was computed by matching the thermally produced fluctuations to gauge invariant parameters when the fluctuations cross the horizon ( for other phenomenological treatments of warm inflation see @xcite ) .",
    "this work provided a clear statement of the consistency condition .",
    "cold inflation has three parameters , related to the potential energy magnitude @xmath183 , slope @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ epsh ] ) and @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ etah ] ) , whereas there are four observable constraints ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 ) .",
    "this implies a redundancy in the observations and allows for a consistency relation @xcite .",
    "this is usually expressed as a relationship between the tensor - to - scalar ratio and the slope of the tensor spectrum .",
    "warm inflation has an extra parameter , the dissipation factor , which implies four constraints for four parameters .",
    "hence we do not expect the consistency relation of standard inflation to hold in warm inflation @xcite . thus discriminating between warm and standard",
    "inflation requires measuring all four observables .",
    "the wmap and upcoming planck satellite missions should provide strong constraints on the scalar spectrum and having polarization detectors , it is hoped the tensor spectrum also will be measured .",
    "at the same level of approximation , nongaussian effects from warm inflation models were computed and found to be of the same order of magnitude as in the cold inflation case , and thus too small to be measured @xcite .",
    "one interesting feauture about warm inflation dynamics is that it offers a solution to the @xmath188-problem @xcite . in standard inflation models",
    "@xcite , where inflaton evolution is damped by the term @xmath189 , the slow - roll condition amounts to @xmath190 , which equivalently means the potential can not have mass terms bigger than @xmath191 .    since supersymmetry suppresses quantum corrections ,",
    "thus can preserve the tree level potential , it has been a central idea in realizing such flat inflationary potentials .",
    "of course , since inflation requires a nonzero vacuum energy density , inevitably susy must be broken during the inflation period , thus possibly ruining the desired degree of flatness in the potential . in particular , once supergravity effects are included , it becomes very difficult for this symmetry to preserve flatness at the leevl of @xmath192 . for f - term inflation , where the nonzero vacuum energy density arises from terms in the superpotential",
    ", no symmetry prohibits the appearance of the planck mass suppressed higher dimensional operators @xmath193 @xcite for the large class of chaotic inflation type models @xcite , where inflation occurs with the inflaton field amplitude above @xmath194 , to control these higher dimensional operators would require the fine - tuning of a infinite number of parameters or choosing only certain types of sugra corrections , such as the mininal kahler potential . even for models where inflation occurs for field amplitudes below the planck scale , dimension six operator terms of the form @xmath195 can emerge and ruin the desired flatness .",
    "both minimal and nonminimal kahler potentials can lead to such terms @xcite .",
    "one possible solution to the @xmath188-problem might be d - term inflation . in such models ,",
    "the nonzero vacuum energy arises from the supersymmetrization of the gauge kinetic energy .",
    "however a closer examination @xcite reveals that attaining the required degree of flatness makes such models very restrictive .    up to now ,",
    "attempts to solve the eta - problem have sought symmetries that can maintain this desired degree of flatness .",
    "one of the few that has proven successful is called the heisenberg symmetry @xcite , although it is very restrictive .",
    "another proposal has been a certain shift symmetry @xcite , which is particularly interesting as it does not require susy . in common , all attempts so far have one foregone conclusion , that inflaton dynamics is only viable for @xmath192 . however , if the inflaton evolution happened to have a damping term larger than @xmath196 , then clearly slow - roll can be satisfied for @xmath197 .",
    "such a possibility is precisely what occurs in warm inflationary dynamics .    to see this",
    "let us examine the warm inflation solution for the simple potential @xmath198 in the cold inflation case , such a model requires an initial inflaton amplitude @xmath199 . moreover , susy models that realize a potential like this inevitably lead to an eta - problem based on the reasons discussed above .",
    "let us now treat this model in the warm inflation case . to focus on the essential points , our calculations here will be purely phenomenological , although they can be readily derived from a first principles quantum field theory calculation as done in sect .",

    "being consistent with the observed baryon asymmetry and the atmospheric neutrino oscillations does not directly constraint the value of @xmath241 but the value of @xmath283 gev . in the warm inflationary regime",
    "the value of the scale @xmath258 required for successful inflation reduces as we moved into the strong dissipative regime , @xmath284 is of the order of @xmath285 gev for @xmath286 , and the gravitino constraint gives now @xmath287 gev .",
    "therefore , a model of @xmath288 inflation and leptogenesis without the need of small couplings would be viable and compatible with observations , in the strong dissipative regime .",
    "in this talk we have reviewed the basic ideas of warm inflation and compared them to the standard or cold inflation picture .",
    "an important point that has been attempted to be converyed is that interactions in a inflation model lagrangian can have significant effects during the inflation period .",
    "this point has led to the key result that many typical models of inflation , which had been assumed to yield just cold inflation dynamics , in fact have regimes of warm inflation .",
    "the realization of this fact leads to many interesting and new questions . from the one direction is model building . in the warm inflation case , there are some new features that do not exist for cold inflation . for one",
    "the @xmath188-problem can be elminated simply by the dissipative dynamics and does not require any further constaints on the particle phyiscs model , in particular the kahler potential .",
    "this means greater flexibility to the high energy properties of the models .",
    "another new feature is that for monomial potentials , observationally consistent warm inflation occurs for field amplitudes below the planck scale , in constrast to cold inflation , where it is well known chaotic inflation requires @xmath289 .",
    "this difference implies from the perspective of effective theories , monomial potentials are accpetable in the strong dissipative warm inflation regime .",
    "another interesting direction is determining tests that could discrimnate warm versus cold inflation from observational data .",
    "the nature of the density perturbations in the two dynamics is different , so one should expect to find different observational signatures in the two cases . for one",
    "the tensor - to - scalar rations differ for the two cases . also , although we have not explored this direction in great detail in this talk , more careful analysis of density perturbations done by evolving the complete set of cosmological perturbation equations was done in @xcite .",
    "this analysis showed that dissipative effects can produce a rich variety of scalar spectra ranging between red and blue and can also cause oscillations in the scalar power spectrum .",
    "further understanding of all these possibilities is needed before firm criteria can be set of for discriminating between warm and cold inflation behavior in the cmb data .",
