    "hence @xmath5 in @xmath6 that is , @xmath7 in @xmath8 by the sub and super - solution method we deduce that there exists @xmath9 a solution of problem such that @xmath10    now we proceed to get our contradiction . integrating in and taking into account the fact that @xmath11 is negative , we deduce @xmath12 using monotonicity of @xmath13 and the fact that @xmath14 in @xmath6 the above inequality yields @xmath15 since @xmath16 on @xmath17 the above relation implies @xmath18 where @xmath19 now , relations and imply @xmath20 therefore , for any compact subset @xmath21 we have @xmath22 passing to the limit as @xmath23 in the above inequality , it follows that @xmath24 this yields @xmath25 on the other hand , the hypothesis @xmath26 combined with implies @xmath27 in @xmath6 for some @xmath28 the last inequality together with and produces @xmath29 where @xmath30 but , by a result of lazer and mckenna ( see @xcite ) , @xmath31 if and only if @xmath32 this contradiction shows that problem has no classical solutions and the proof is now complete .",

    "<S> we also establish the asymptotic behaviour of the solution around the bifurcation point . </S>",
