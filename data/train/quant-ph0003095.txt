    "in the previous papers @xcite , we have presented a diagrammatic proof of reparametrization invariance of perturbatively defined quantum - mechanical path integrals .",

    "@xcite the perturbative calculations were performed in momentum space , where feynman integrals in a continuous number of dimensions @xmath1 are known from the prescriptions of t  hooft and m.  veltman@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have found the same results directly from the feynman integrals in the @xmath3-dimensional time space with the help of the bessel representation of green functions .",
    "the coordinate space calculation is interesting for many applications , for instance , if one wants to obtain the effective action of a field system in curvilinear coordinates , where the kinetic term depends on the dynamic variable",
    ". then one needs rules for performing temporal integrals over wick contractions of local fields .",
    "in this note we want to show that the reparametrization invariance of perturbatively defined quantum - mechanical path integrals can be obtained in the coordinate space with the help of a simple but quite general arguments based on the inhomogeneous field equation for the green function , and rules of the partial integration .",
    "the prove does not require the calculation of the feynman integrals separately and remains valid for the functional integrals in an arbitrary space - time dimension @xmath1 .",

    "the kinetic term @xmath9 goes over into @xmath10 .",
    "if the path integral over @xmath11 is performed perturbatively , the expansion terms contains temporal integrals over wick contractions which , after suitable partial integrations , are products of the following basic correlation functions @xmath12 the right - hand sides define the line symbols to be used in feynman diagrams for the interaction terms .",

    "the third correlation function ( [ @d3 ] ) contains a @xmath17-function : @xmath18 the temporal integrals in @xmath19-space over products of such distributions are undefined .",
    "in our previous papers @xcite we have shown that a unique perturbation expansions leading to a reparametrization invariant theory is obtained by extending the path integral to a @xmath1-dimensional functional integral , and by performing the perturbation expansion in @xmath1-dimensional space , with a limit @xmath20 taken at the end .    in this note",

    "the diagrams are composed of the three types of lines in ( [ @d1])([@d3 ] ) , and new interaction vertices for each power of @xmath27 .",
    "the diagrams coming from the jacobian action ( [ pix@m8 ] ) are easily recognized by an accompanying power of @xmath42 .        in our previous papers@xcite",
    ", all integrals were calculated individually in @xmath54 dimensions , taking the limit @xmath55 at the end . here",
    "we set up simple rules for finding the same results , which make the sum of all feynman diagrams contributing to each order @xmath38 vanish .",
    "the path integral ( [ m3 ] ) is extended to an associated functional integral in a @xmath1-dimensional coordinate space @xmath56 , with coordinates @xmath57 , by replacing @xmath58 in the kinetic term by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 . the jacobian action term ( [ m6 ] )",
