    "since the early days of analytical stellar spectroscopy , it has been known that equivalent widths have numerous advantages over the use of profiles .",
    "it is easily demonstrated that equivalent widths are unaffected by various and often uncertain broadening mechanisms , both stellar and instrumental ( see below ) .",
    "nevertheless , modern methods have made it possible to synthesize large regions of the spectra of many stars .",
    "following the pioneering paper by @xcite , _ spectroscopy made easy _ , considerable work has been based on automated methods , some based on equivalent widths , but many stressing spectral synthesis ( cf . , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "while these methods have been demonstrated to work quite well , they could be strengthened _ by incorporating knowledge of wavelengths sensitive to the stellar properties sought_.    we emphasize abundances here . in practice other factors ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , microturbulence ) must be known , and generally must be sought simultaneously with abundances .",
    "this is a strength of some of the automated methods .",
    "the basic technique we advocate could be adapted for these other parameters , but that is not done here .",
    "for the most part , automated methods are used with cooler stars , where the abundance patterns are of limited scope , e.g. [ fe / h ] or [ @xmath3/fe ] variations .",
    "the situation is more subtle with chemically peculiar stars ( cp ) of the upper main sequence , or peculiar red giants , where element - to - element variations can be large .",
    "the analysis of young stars are also problematical , where standard , lte models are of questionable validity , especially in the region where the cores of strong lines are formed .    our goal is to show that knowledge of abundance - sensitive regions of line profiles make it possible to improve accuracy .",
    "we illustrate how inaccuracies can arise from the use of regions of line profiles less sensitive to abundance than other factors such as turbulence , or damping .",
    "it is convenient to consider changes in line profiles resulting from abundance variations one element at a time . in the present examples",
    "the element will be iron .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath4 for abundances on the usual logarithmic scale , where for hydrogen @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the number of iron atoms and ions to the sum for all elements including iron .",
    "the illustrations are all simulations where the input parameters are precisely known .",
    "we vary abundance , microturbulence ( @xmath7 ) , rotation ( @xmath8 ) , and the macroturbulence ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the latter is taken to be a gaussian , and assumed here to include instrumental broadening . in most stellar work ,",
    "the macroturbulence is assumed to be isotropic with a gaussian profile .",
    "gaussians are also typically assumed for instrumental profiles .",
    "let the parameter defining the profile of an absorption line be the line depth , @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the flux at the wavelength @xmath13 in the line profile and continuum , respectively .",
    "following @xcite the sensitivity of each profile point to the @xmath14-variations may be calculated by the ratio    @xmath15    the spectra are calculated with an assumed abundance @xmath14 and again with @xmath14 varied by @xmath16 .",
    "we adopted @xmath17 dex to avoid large changes in the line profiles .",
    "essentially the same information is obtained with other small values of @xmath18 . in this way",
    "we can calculate the sensitivity of each point of line profile to abundance without involving the more complex response functions which involve partial derivatives of the emergent flux with respect to the free parameters .     calculated with assumed iron abundance @xmath19 ( black ) , @xmath20 ( green ) , @xmath21 ( red ) .",
    "the sensitivity function @xmath22 is shown in the subfigure , with the most sensitive points indicated .",
    "only the iron abundance has been changed . here , and",
    "in the following figures , colors refer to the online version .",
    ", width=321 ]    calculations are based on the synthesis code spansat @xcite , and a marcs model atmosphere with @xmath23  k , @xmath24 , and the chemical composition of the sun . local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte )",
    "is assumed throughout .",
    "the marcs model is available online at http://marcs.astro.uu.se .",
    "we use a depth - independent microturbulence @xmath25  , corresponding to that used in the marcs model and an isotropic macroturbulence of 2.4  .",
    "the rotational velocity ( @xmath26  @xcite ) was simulated by direct averaging over the disk .",
    "the synthesis of spectral regions includes the full list of lines available in the vald database , with line parameters : wavelengths , excitation potentials , oscillator strengths , and damping parameters .",
    "a few features that are in the real solar spectrum are not in our calculation .",
    "these include molecular lines , not in our version of vald , as well as unidentified or unclassified atomic lines .",
    "but with relatively high rotation velocity @xmath27  .",
    "symbols ` s ' and ` i ' mark regions sensitive and insensitive to the iron abundance . ,",
    "width=321 ]      the eye is drawn most naturally to the cores of the stronger lines , where the separation for the different abundances is most evident .",
    "the calculated sensitivity function shows how deceptive this visual impression can be .",
    "the cores of the stronger features are generally the _ least _ sensitive parts of the profile to abundance .",
    "the most sensitive feature in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] is the weak absorption at 424.395 ( w ) , which shows the advantage of using weak lines for abundances .",
    "the two stronger lines , s@xmath28 and s@xmath29 are sensitive only in their wings . the moderately strength lines , m@xmath28 and m@xmath29 show intermediate cases . while the wings of moderate and strong lines can also be quite sensitive to abundances , these regions are also sensitive to other , sometimes quite complicating factors . beyond the doppler core , the wing strength depends on the product of the abundance , the line strength , and the damping constant .",
    "hyperfine structure , and zeeman broadening could be relevant .",
    "in addition , the instrumental profile must be accurately known as well as broadening due to stellar turbulence ( micro and macro ) , before accurate abundances can be determined from line wings .",
    "these factors have virtually precluded the practical use of line wings in most abundance studies .",
    "there is , however , new work in which advantage could be taken of the sensitivity of line wings .",
    "we refer specifically to the new differential work on abundances of solar - type stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . thus far",
    ", this work has been based on equivalent widths .",
    "however , in comparing two closely similar stars , with spectra obtained by identical instruments , and reduced with the same procedures , the unknown broadening mechanisms should cancel .",
    "there is thus good reason to hope that these differential methods can be strengthened through the use of line wings .      a great deal of important work deals with convoluted spectra , where it may not be possible to analyze weak , isolated features .",
    "this convolution may arise from the use of low instrumental resolution or in studies of integrated spectra of stellar systems .",
    "sensitivity functions should be comparably useful in all of these cases .",
    "the spectra of single stars are often convoluted by rotation , which we discuss here .",
    "the region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] is the same as in  [ fig : fig1 ] but the profiles were broadened by an assumed rotation .",
    "the appearance of the spectra and the sensitivity functions themselves are markedly changed .",
    "wider regions of the spectrum are now sensitive , though the sensitivities themselves are lowered  in the case of the maxima , by some 21 per cent",
    ". it would surely be useful for an abundance worker to see that the region from 424.41 to 424.45 nm was relatively sensitive ( s ) to the iron abundance while that from 424.51 to 424.55 was not ( i ) .",
    "traditional plots showing observed and calculated spectra obscure the sensitivity of weak features that is shown by the sensitivity functions .",
    "a 20 % change of a feature that is only 10 % deep makes a change in the depth of only 0.02 in the depth .",
    "this difference is hardly noticable on a standard plot .",
    "by contrast , a change of only 5% on a line of depth 0.9 makes a change of 0.045 , more than double the much larger _ percentage _ change of the weaker feature",
    ".    it might be helpful for abundance workers to use plots in which the logarithms of line depths are plotted rather than linear , relative fluxes .",
    "an example is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : pl3log ] , it conveys much the same information as the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the logarithmic plot compresses the larger line depths ; the ( online color ) separation in the sensitive regions are more obvious while that for the stronger cores are suppressed . a logarithmic plot similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : pl3log ] , but showing observed and calculated spectra would help to focus attention on the weaker , more abundance - sensitive parts of the spectra .",
    "unlike the sensitivity functions , such plots do not have the ability to display sensitivity to specific elements .",
    "in this section a number of calculations are presented , based on the fe i line at 6151.62   . its ( lower ) excitation potential is 2.18 ev .",
    "the @xmath30 given by @xcite is @xmath313.29 .",
    "however , this value is varied for purposes of illustration . all profiles described in this section",
    "were calculated with the wavelength step of 5  m  and marcs solar model .",
    "the independence of equivalent widths of weak lines is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eqwth ] , where very different profiles yield the same abundances .",
    "this of course is a well known result .",
    "we use it here to emphasize that in this case , all of the relevant points are sensitive in the sense used in this paper .",
    "the sensitive function of each profile is high although it varies slightly with line depth .",
    "the parameters used in fig .  [ fig : eqwth ] are given in table  [ tab : weaklins ] .",
    ".parameters used for the four profiles of fig .",

    "the listing is from the narrowest to broadest profile . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,>,^ \" , ]     , pro .  1 ) .",
    "]    to demonstrate the degeneracy of abundance and damping , we set the damping constant ( @xmath32 ) increased by a factor @xmath33 and tried to compensate that by changing abundance . to get the best fit for this new line profile ,",

    "to which these factors could be important depends on how closely the differenced stars resemble one another .",

    "]    the sensitive region contains 313 points .",
    "the best fit to the sensitive points gives the original @xmath19 and a small @xmath36 of 3.2@xmath37 .",
    "if the central region of the profile is included , there are 799 points , and the fit is obviously less good ; @xmath38 .    in this section we have demonstrated that a fit to a strong line  including sensitive points  does not necessarily mean that a correct abundance will be obtained . on the other hand we show that even if the core of a strong line is poorly fit , an accurate abundance can be obtained when the broadening is accurately known .",
    "not all portions of a stellar spectrum are equally sensitive to abundances . in this paper",
    "we showed that a good abundance not only depends on the choice of accurate atomic parameters , but the selection of features that are sensitive to abundances .",
    "we proposed a scheme to find abundance - sensitive regions . by far ,",
    "the most useful features for abundances are weak lines with reliable @xmath39-values .",
    "the use of weak features requires accurate continuum adjustment , which is rarely as accurate as 0.5 per cent .",
    "unidentified blends or blends with inaccurate atomic parameters in the line wings do not allow the use of most profiles in the abundance analysis .",
    "however , we can select sensitive points in the profile parts are free from the blends or omit some points near the continuum where these effects are significant .",
    "we show that moderately strong lines , in spite of having sensitive regions , are usually less good for abundance work due to their high sensitivity to turbulence .",
    "today , the application of 1d atmosphere models and classical concepts of micro and macroturbulence are widely used and the problem of uncertainty of the synthetic profiles due to the micro and macroturbulence remains for sensitive profile points . while the line profile results obtained with 3d hydrodynamical ( hd ) stellar atmosphere models without any need for micro or macroturbulence are not without problems .",
    "theoretical profiles of the moderate lines computed in 3d hd systematically underestimate the line width and that some additional work on improving the atmospheric velocity field is still required @xcite .",
    "strong lines can be useful , especially in differential abundance work . the wings of very strong lines are insensitive to turbulence parameters and the nlte - effects . they can be used for profile fits when the damping constants are well known .                    c.  r. , 1995 , in sauval a.  j. , blomme r. , grevesse n. , eds , laboratory and astronomical high resolution spectra vol .",
