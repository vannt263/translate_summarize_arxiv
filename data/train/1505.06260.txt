    "the idea that newton s theory of gravitation , can be formulated in curved space has been recently analyzed by abramowicz and collaborators @xcite@xmath0 .",
    "in addition to considering newtonian gravitation in curved space , an equation linking the geometry of the 3-space with the matter sector was put forward @xcite@xmath0 .",
    "this is called an enhanced newtonian gravitation . in particular , this modification to newton s theory allows the construction of a wormhole space @xcite@xmath0 .",
    "wormholes in general relativity have been studied in several works see @xcite for example . in this paper , we report on the construction of a spherically symmetric wormhole @xcite in this enhanced newtonian gravitation .",
    "we further analyze the tidal effects that emerge from the gravitational forces and the curvature of space in this spherically symmetric newtonian wormhole space .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ fund ] we start by writing the equations that define the enhanced newtonian theory of gravitation . in sec .  [ newtonworm ] we construct a static spherically symmetric newtonian wormhole , we find the gravitational field , the gravitational potential and the pressure of the fluid that supports the wormhole .",
    "then , we study test particle s motion in the wormhole geometry and gravitational field .",
    "finally we analyze the tidal forces exerted by the gravitational field and the curvature of space in two nearby particles . in sec .",
    "[ conc ] , we conclude and speculate on the possible existence of truly newtonian black holes in this enhanced newtonian theory of gravitation .",
    "the classical formulation of newton s theory of gravitation was constructed for an absolute 3-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "we see , however , that the set of equations that comprise newton s theory of gravitation are also well defined for curved space . indeed , abramowicz et al .",
    "@xcite recently proposed a formulation of newton s theory of gravitation in curved space .",
    "poisson s equation in curved space is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the curved space metric , @xmath3 is the covariant derivative induced by the metric , the indices @xmath4 run as @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the density of the matter . for static systems the continuity equation is trivially verified and the euler equation is simplified to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fluid s pressure .",
    "now , a possible enhancement to newton s theory of gravitation was proposed in @xcite where a relation between the geometry of space and the matter was introduced and given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ricci scalar and @xmath11 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the equations of motion of a test particle with mass @xmath12 subjected to a gravitational potential @xmath13 are given by newton s second law , @xmath14 where it was assumed that the inertial and gravitational mass of the test particle are equal .",
    "- define an enhanced newtonian gravitation .",
    "our purpose is to make use of eqs .  - to construct a static , spherical symmetric wormhole space .",
    "let us then generically write the metric of the space as @xmath15 such that the ricci scalar @xmath10 is @xmath16}{r^{2}a\\left(r\\right){}^{2}}\\,.\\label{eq:5}\\ ] ] now , to proceed we consider the expression for the mass density to be @xmath17 where @xmath18 has dimensions of mass density and @xmath19 of distance . substituting eqs .   and in eq .",
    "we find the general form of the metric , for the imposed mass density , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an integration constant and @xmath22      having found the generic form of the metric , we have now to restrict the values of the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath18 and @xmath11 to have a wormhole geometry . for such , we will follow  @xcite and use an embedding diagram .",
    "so , in the euclidean embedding space the axially symmetric embedded surface can be , using cylindrical coordinates @xmath24 , uniquely described by a function @xmath25 . identifying the coordinates @xmath26 of the embedding euclidean space with the coordinates @xmath27 of the wormhole space , we find the following relation @xmath28 which can be used to study the properties of the space . from eq .   and imposing the throat condition we find that the integration constant @xmath21 is given by @xmath29 and the range of values of the parameter @xmath30 is constrained to be @xmath31 .",
    "the same restriction to the parameter @xmath23 is found from the flare - out condition .",
    "substituting eq .   in eq .",
    "we find @xmath32 where @xmath33 another restriction to have a wormhole geometry is that although near the wormhole s throat , @xmath34 , the radial coordinate @xmath35 is ill behaved , the proper radial distance must be finite .",
    "this condition implies a new restriction to @xmath23 @xmath36 where the critical value of @xmath23 is given by @xmath37 $ ] , and @xmath38 represents the infimum of the function in the specified range .",
    "this gives @xmath39 up to the third decimal place .",
    "comparing eq .   with the restriction found from the throat condition , @xmath40 , we conclude that the product @xmath41 is then restricted by eqs .   and .    due to the range of values that the parameter @xmath23 might take ,",
    "various distinct cases could be considered . here",
    "we shall be interested in the class of wormholes whose parameters @xmath18 , @xmath11 and * * @xmath19 obey @xmath42 together with @xmath43 , and so @xmath44 .      now that we have found the metric of the newtonian wormhole we have to remove the coordinate singularity at @xmath34 . considering a new coordinate @xmath45 , defined as @xmath46 , such that @xmath47 , one finds that the metric of the space can be rewritten as @xmath48 it will also be useful to write the mass density in the new coordinates .",
    "it is given by the expression @xmath49      having defined the geometry of the space we can now study the gravitational potential of the newtonian wormhole by solving eq .  .",
    "it is , however , considering the symmetries of the system , straightforward to solve eq .   by using gauss s law for gravity and integrating this equation over a volume",
    "whose boundary are the surfaces of constant gravitational potential . defining the gravitational force field as @xmath50 with a comma denoting a partial derivative",
    ", we find @xmath51 where the mass within radius @xmath45 is given by @xmath52 defining the magnitude of the gravitational field as @xmath53 we give in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] its behavior as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath45 for various values of the parameter @xmath23 .",

    "]    using the expression for the gravitational field , eq .   together with eq .  , the gravitational potential @xmath13 can be computed at a given point using numerical methods , provided the wormhole parameters are given .",
    "moreover , these equations can also be used to find the pressure of the fluid that covers the wormhole space . numerically solving eqs .",
    "and we find that the pressure is positive throughout the space showing that the wormhole is hold against gravitational collapse by pressure @xcite@xmath0 . from eq .",
    "( [ gravforce ] ) one sees that the gradient of the potential @xmath13 is the gravitational force field @xmath58 , and from eq .",
    "( [ eulereq ] ) the gradient of the pressure @xmath8 goes with minus the gradient of the gravitational potential @xmath13 .",
    "thus one can infer from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , and the help of eqs .",
    "( [ eulereq ] ) , ( [ gravforce ] ) , and ( [ mag2 ] ) , that at the wormhole s center @xmath59 ,",
    "i.e. , at the throat , the pressure is maximal , as one would expect .    in the limiting case",
    "that the wormhole has @xmath60 a newtonian event horizon develops at some radial coordinate @xmath61 , in the sense that any particle inside the sphere defined by @xmath61 can only affect an outside observer if it has infinite acceleration , and thus infinite velocity .",
    "thus , since no particles can come out of this inner region one is in the presence of a newtonian black hole .",
    "however , for @xmath60 the pressure support at the throat goes to infinity , and so , in this limit , the wormhole eventually collapses .",
    "now we use eq .   to study the motion of a test particle in the gravitational field of the wormhole space . consider that a particle s path is described by a curve @xmath62 , whose components @xmath63 are given by @xmath64 such that the particle s velocity is @xmath65 , where a dot means a derivative with respect to time @xmath66 .",

    "it is possible to show that one can treat the problem of the motion of a test particle by considering pure equatorial orbits , i.e. , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "let us consider the simpler problem of a test particle describing pure circular motion in the newtonian wormhole space . in this case",
    "the coordinate @xmath45 is a constant , @xmath74 , say , so @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "from this , eq .",
    "can be solved for @xmath77 and obtain @xmath78 eq",
    ".   relates the radial position @xmath74 and the angular velocity @xmath77 for a particle to describe a circular orbit in the wormhole space .",
    "now , except the case of pure circular motion , to solve the equations of motion - for a more generic motion , numerical methods must be used , provided the initial position and velocity of the test particle and the wormhole parameters * @xmath19 * and @xmath18 are given .",
    "we now analyze the relative separation of two test particles in the gravitational field of the spherical newtonian wormhole space .",
    "the two test particles are initially considered to be infinitesimally close , subjected only to the gravitational field of the newtonian wormhole , such that the acceleration of a test particle at a certain point is given by eq .   and eqs .  - . this relative separation ,",
    "i.e. , the tidal deviation equation , is in part given by the variation of the gravitational force field acted on each particle and another part given by the geodesic deviation due to the spatial curvature through the equation , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the separation vector between two infinitesimally close particles , @xmath58 is the gravitational force field generated by the wormhole mass , given by eq .",

    "hence , in eq .  , we might take all the terms in @xmath84 to zero .",
    "notice , however , that this does not mean that , in general , the acceleration of the component @xmath85 of the separation vector is zero since the motion of the second particle may not be along the equator . now , considering the metric of the spherical newtonian wormhole space , eq .  , and assuming @xmath83 and @xmath86 , we find from eq .   that the deviation equations for two infinitesimally close test particles in the spherically symmetric newtonian wormhole space are @xmath87\\,,\\label{dev_theta}\\\\ \\frac{d^{2}n^{\\varphi}}{dt^{2}}= & -\\gamma_{\\varphi l}^{\\varphi}\\mathcal{g}^{l}n^{\\varphi}+r_{ll\\varphi}^{\\varphi}v^{l}\\left[n^{\\varphi}v^{l}-n^{l}v^{\\varphi}\\right]\\,.\\label{eq : dev_phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the christoffel symbols that appear in eqs",

    "now , looking at eqs .",
    "- , in general , it is not possible to find analytical solutions since the fiducial test particle s velocity must also be taken into account .",
    "so , to solve this system of differential equations , we must first solve the equations of motion , eqs .  - , and",
    "in general there is no analytical solution .",
    "we can however work out some features of the tidal effects in the case of pure radial motion of two test particles such that throughout the motion the line that connects the two particles is purely radial , i.e. , the case where @xmath85 , @xmath96 , @xmath84 , and @xmath97 are zero throughout the particles motion .",
    "in this case eq .   simplifies to @xmath98 and eqs .   and yield @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",

    "as @xmath102 we present in fig .  [ fig:2 ] its behavior .",
    "we see that the sign of the function @xmath103 changes at some value of the coordinate @xmath45 , @xmath104 , say .",
    "now , when @xmath105 the function @xmath106 is positive , @xmath107 , which implies that the separation vector has positive acceleration .",
    "so , suppose two test particles describing pure radial motion , such that the line that connects them is purely radial .",
    "one particle has radial coordinate @xmath108 , the other @xmath109 , and let us assume , @xmath110 and @xmath111 with @xmath112 for simplicity . in this case , since @xmath107 , the particle with coordinate @xmath108 is accelerating more than the particle with coordinate @xmath109 , and they fly apart . on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath113 the function @xmath106 is negative , @xmath114 , so the separation vector has negative acceleration .",
    "assuming now @xmath115 , and still @xmath110 , this means that the particle with coordinate @xmath108 is accelerating less , but still towards the wormhole s throat , than the particle with coordinate @xmath109 . numerically solving eq .   for two initially close test particles in the regions @xmath105 and @xmath113 , indeed , we verify this conclusions .",
    "notice that as we consider particles further away from the wormhole s throat we recover the tidal behavior expected from newtonian gravitation since the space is asymptotically flat .",
