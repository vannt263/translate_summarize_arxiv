    "in the lep-1 period of data collection , from 1989 to 1995 , about 170  pb@xmath2 of data were collected by each lep experiment at energies near the mass of the z@xmath3 boson , yielding approximately @xmath4 hadronic annihilation events per experiment .",
    "so far at lep-2 , which began in 1996 and is scheduled to run through 2000 , a total of 270  pb@xmath2 of data has been collected at center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energies , e@xmath1 , of 161 , 172 , 183 and 189  gev . although the luminosity at lep-2 is large , the event rate is small : the corresponding numbers of qcd events are only about 400 , 240 , 1300 and 3000 per experiment . by `` qcd event , ''",
    "it is meant a hadronic annihilation event produced through the s - channel decay of a virtual z@xmath5 to a quark - antiquark pair , in which there is minimal initial - state photon radiation so that the hadronic system carries near to the full c.m . energy value . besides the lep-1 and lep-2 data , lep ran at an energy of about 133  gev in 1995 and 1997 : thus well above the z@xmath3 mass but below the threshold for w@xmath6w@xmath7 production .",
    "this data is sometimes referred to as lep-1.5 .",
    "about 10  pb@xmath2 of data were collected at lep-1.5 , yielding about 700 qcd events .",
    "the lep-2 data provide the possibility to study qcd at the highest available e@xmath6e@xmath7 energies , where uncertainties from hadronization and unknown higher order terms in perturbative expressions for experimental observables are relatively small .",
    "the large statistics of the lep-1 data allow tests and measurements not possible with other data samples .",
    "the lep data together allow the energy evolution of qcd quantities to be studied . in the following , we present a summary of some recent work in qcd performed using the lep data .",
    "we first present preliminary results from the recently completed run at 189  gev . following this",
    ", we discuss some unique and precise tests of qcd made using lep-1 data .",
    "last , we present results using the combined lep data samples to test qcd predictions for the energy scaling of several quantities .",
    "lep ran at 189  gev during 1998 .",
    "each lep experiment collected a data sample of about 190  pb@xmath2 , more than the integrated luminosity collected during the entire lep-1 period .",
    "the most basic qcd test which can be performed using these data is to examine variables which measure the distribution of particle energy and momenta and to compare them to the predictions of qcd monte carlo event generators .",
    "standard `` event shape '' variables used for this purpose are  @xcite , heavy jet mass m@xmath8  @xcite , jet broadening variables b@xmath9 and b@xmath10  @xcite , and y@xmath11 ( sometimes referred to as y@xmath12 or d@xmath13 ) .",
    "thrust is defined as @xmath14 where the thrust axis @xmath15 is the unit vector which maximizes t , as indicted .",
    "the sum is over the particles in the event , with @xmath16 the particle momentum .",
    "the quantities m@xmath8 , b@xmath9 and b@xmath10 are defined by dividing events into hemispheres using the plane perpendicular to @xmath15 : m@xmath8 is the larger of the two hemisphere invariant mass values , while b@xmath9 and b@xmath10 are defined by b@xmath9=max(b@xmath17,b@xmath18 ) and b@xmath10=b@xmath17+b@xmath18 with @xmath19 with the index j=1,2 referring to the hemisphere and where the sum in the numerator is over the particles in hemisphere  @xmath20 .",
    "last , y@xmath11 is the resolution value at which an event changes from being classified as a two - jet event to being classified as a three - jet event using the @xmath21 ( `` durham '' ) recombination jet algorithm  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig - alephes ] ( left ) , aleph measurements of 1-t , ( m@xmath8/e@xmath1)@xmath22 and b@xmath9 at 189  gev are shown in comparison to the predictions of the pythia  @xcite , herwig  @xcite and ariadne  @xcite monte carlo multihadronic parton shower event generators .",
    "the parameters of the event generators were tuned using z@xmath3 data .",
    "the event generators are seen to describe the 189  gev data well , demonstrating that the energy evolution of the variables is as expected from qcd .",
    "opal at 189  gev .",
    "shown in comparison to the data are the predictions of the principle qcd monte carlo programs , tuned to provide an approximately equivalent description of global event properties at the z@xmath3 .",
    "pythia , herwig and ariadne , all based on parton showers with coherence ( soft gluon interference ) , are seen to describe the energy evolution of the mean multiplicity well .",
    "cojets  @xcite , based on a parton shower without coherence , describes the high energy data poorly and thus does not exhibit the correct energy scaling behavior .",
    "a similar result is obtained by aleph using a variant of pythia without coherence  @xcite .",
    "these results are highly suggestive of the need to include coherence effects in qcd predictions to obtain an accurate description of multiplicity in e@xmath6e@xmath7 data .",
