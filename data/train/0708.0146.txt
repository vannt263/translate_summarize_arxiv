    "the _ mariner 10 _ spacecraft made detailed observations of surface topography ( @xmath5 km resolution over a significant area but often at high sun angle ) , and inferred magnetic field properties during its mostly successful flybys .",
    "because of the 3:2 spin - orbit resonance of mercury , the same hemisphere was illuminated during all three encounters .    over the past 30 yr",
    ", the other `` mystery hemisphere '' has been the target of optical and especially radar imaging to learn if large - scale morphological structures such as impact basins and their antipodal effects that were discovered by _ mariner _ have counterparts elsewhere .",
    "radar imagery has covered more than @xmath6 of this hemisphere and has reached @xmath7 km resolution @xcite ; sensitive to surface roughness , tilt , and dielectric constant , radar response does not depend on crater diameter .",
    "a preliminary stratigraphy of mercury was developed from the overlap of features in the _ mariner _ images and is keyed to major basin forming events modified by volcanism .",
    "additional major events recorded on the side not imaged by _ mariner",
    "_ could alter this sequence substantially .",
    "mercury is a bright object , so exposures on even modest aperture telescopes can be brief to `` freeze '' turbulent astronomical seeing . despite the large zenith distance and bright sky , selection of the sharpest `` lucky images '' from many",
    "@xcite can permit use of an aperture large enough to map surface topography .",
    "notable studies of mercury using this technique mapped longitudes @xmath8 @xcite in the morning sky and @xmath9 @xcite ( subsequently expanded and summarized in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the evening .",
    "albedo features on mercury has also been so imaged by webcam equipped amateur astronomers , with impressive results from modest equipment ( f.  melillo , private comm . )    to map the lesser explored quadrant @xmath10 in morning illumination ( i.e. , the complementary phase to that of @xcite ) , in late 2007 march we used a modern high - performance telescope at an excellent observing site , the 4.1 m soar telescope atop cerro pachon , chile . in ",
    "2 we describe image acquisition and processing . in ",
    "3 we present our map of this quadrant , and compare to previous optical and radar results . in   4 we discuss the implications of our findings on the surface properties of mercury .",
    "we summarize in   5 .",
    "ground - level turbulence can be small at dawn after a night of surface cooling .",
    "our observations were therefore made during a morning elongation of mercury that was favorable from chile and that presented to us the hemisphere not mapped by _",
    "mariner_. mercury rotates slowly so most longitude coverage during an elongation arises from changes in phase angle . during the second half of the 2007 march - april elongation mercury",
    "spanned @xmath11 as its phase increased from 55 to @xmath12 and sub - earth longitude increased from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , while the sub - earth latitude was @xmath15 .",
    "we intended to observe on 4 mornings every 3 days starting at maximum elongation , during pre - scheduled university of north carolina ( unc ) and engineering time .",
    "unfortunately , weather delivered a sequence of excessive humidity , clouds , and bad seeing , so we obtained data only on the mornings of 2007 march 23 and april 1 . to calibrate , we also observed stars , jupiter , and saturn .",
    "the soar telescope is often operated remotely from partner institutions over the abeline ( internet2 ) network @xcite , sharing with other cerro - tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) telescopes up to 35 mbit  s@xmath16 bandwidth .",
    "multiple instruments are installed for the long - term at various soar foci .",
    "our telepresence during dawn and sunrise had minimal impact on other programs . because our observations ended after sunrise , certain detector calibrations that would ideally be done with dawn illumination were instead made either during evenings or within the light - tight dome .",
    "most modern telescopes mount instruments at nasmyth foci where it is particularly challenging to baffle light scatter .",
    "thus , we did not expect to observe beyond sunrise over the andes east of cerro pachon .",
    "also , the tertiary and primary telescope mirrors look upward so are easily contaminated with light scattering dust .",
    "luckily , the soar optics had been washed thoroughly @xmath17 days before our observations began .    to obtain sharp images from a stack of tens of thousands of exposures in seeing characterized by spatial scale @xmath18",
    ", one must reduce the telescope aperture @xmath19 until @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 degrades with zenith angle @xmath21 and wavelength as @xmath22 for our study of mercury .",
    "we fabricated and installed across the top ring of the telescope near the entrance pupil an opaque , black cloth mask .",
    "the mask required an hour to install beginning at the start of astronomical twilight . hoping for better than average seeing at a challenging @xmath23 elevation",
    ", we had our tailor cut an elliptical hole of minor diameter 1.35 m. this projected a circular pupil , unobstructed by telescope secondary mirror `` spider '' supports .",
    "the mask blocked the facility shack - hartmann array from sampling the full set of stellar wavefront tilts to set telescope active optics , normally done after large - angle motions .",
    "the software could not handle an off - axis sub - aperture .",
    "we therefore used only pre - calibrated lookup tables , indexed exclusively by temperature sensors and the telescope elevation angle .",
    "we set up on a star at @xmath24 elevation to confirm focus and pointing , and to make a movie to understand the current speckle structure . on the first morning , 2007 march 23 ,",
    "long exposure seeing scaled to the zenith was @xmath25 , and through our aperture we saw what we had hoped to see : a small number of gyrating speckles of comparable brightness that occasionally merged to produce a very sharp image .",
    "a larger aperture would have passed more speckles , yielding far fewer coincidences hence sharp images .",
    "we could see clear astigmatism on either side of nominal focus , indicating incomplete setting of the telescope active optics .",
    "however , because our target was centered and only a few arc - seconds across , astigmatism was useful to maintain accurate focus so we did not null it .",
    "the 2007 april 1 seeing was worse and we obtained fewer but still excellent images on occasion , probably because the higher sun angle on the disk enhanced the contrast of mercury s subtle shadings .",
    "we acquired mercury at @xmath26 elevation , soar s limit .",
    "these images were horrible , of course , but improved steadily as sunrise approached .",
    "we recorded occasional crisp detail between @xmath27 and @xmath28 elevation before scattered light overwhelmed the signal as the sun crested the andes .",
    "we used an andor corporation luca model camera , a thermoelectrically cooled ( stabilized to @xmath29c ) , non - evacuated housing of a texas instruments frame - transfer ( electronic shutter ) @xmath30 array of 10 micron square pixels and @xmath31 qe at @xmath1 nm . the camera records 30 full - frames s@xmath16 with nominal 25 electrons rms readout noise . with a typical acquisition window of @xmath32 @xmath33 binned pixels ( each @xmath34 on the sky ) , we acquired 140 frames s@xmath16 .",
    "the camera was connected without reduction optics directly to a telescope nasymth focus and to a pc that used andor s solis program to acquire data to a sata drive ( 49 mbyte  s@xmath16 transfer speed ) .",
    "a feature of this camera is its electron multiplying gain , adjustable by software to set the amplification of a separate `` gain register '' prior to readout . with minimal amplification",
    ", exposures of @xmath35 ms produced peak counts @xmath36 of the camera s 14-bit digitization range and had negligible readout noise .",
    "we used this setting for all observations and calibrations because we hoped to work as late as feasible into daylight without saturating the detector on the brightening sky . to reduce atmospheric dispersion below one resolution element",
    ", we used a @xmath37 nm wide interference filter from ctio s collection , centered at @xmath1 nm , and operating in the effective f/38 beam .",
    "we took multiple strings of 10,000 exposures stored as @xmath38 mbyte fits format datacubes . a vnc connection from our remote observing room in chapel hill to the computer desktop in chile allowed us to control data acquisition and to review representative frames with ds9 .",
    "we used the simple _ bbcp _ program to deliver data expeditiously to unc at 3 mbyte  s@xmath16 ( while maintaining the vnc connection , an audio / video link to the telescope operator , and telescope / site telemetry ) . during each dawn we recorded and transferred @xmath7 gbyte of data into unc s soar archive .",
    "we also recorded stacks of 10,000 dark frames of the same duration as the data , exposures so short that they showed only fixed pattern noise near the readout , a 6 dn top - to - bottom gradient in the electronic bias level , and several tens of `` hot pixels '' .",
    "we subtracted the average dark from each exposure of the datacube .    although we recorded evening sky flats and morning dome flats , these unfortunately failed to remove spots in data frames , especially the march 23 data",
    ". spots seem to arise from contamination on the ccd surface , not on its dewar window , so are sensitive to details of their specific illumination .",
    "they are noticeable when successive exposures are viewed as a movie ; the dancing planet image is seemingly being viewed through a somewhat dirty window .",
    "their effect is smeared across the final stacked image by planet motions between its constituent exposures , but image contrast on march 23 would have been higher , and confidence in the reality of subtle albedo variations and shadowing near the terminator increased , without it .",
    "it was also unclear if the nominal flats calibrated pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations . to better match illumination to reduce problems in the flat fields associated with scattered light from bright dome or sky",
    ", we resorted to using the disks of jupiter and saturn .",
    "we obtained 1,000 to 10,000 exposure datacubes of these planets through the filter .",
    "the 200 ms jupiter exposures showed often exquisite detail in the cloud belts around , for example , the little red spot , unsurprising given that this planet was imaged near the zenith in reasonably good seeing .",
    "we coadded the _",
    "@xmath39 of the images that were further blurred by motion between frames , and then used the iraf task to produce spline3 fits row by row and column by column .",
    "we combined row and column fits and ratioed the result into the original image to obtain a flat field .",
    "we scaled the flat to obtain best results and divided it into each exposure of the datacube .",
    "we retained for further processing the @xmath40 highest elevation images from the first morning and @xmath41 from the last .",
    "key to lucky imaging is how one finds the needle in the haystack . after exploring and rejecting contrast and wavelet based algorithms ,",
    "we simply selected by eye the best image of @xmath42 from the highest - elevation string , and then automatically cross - correlated this with the other tens of thousands to produce an output sequence sorted from narrowest @xmath43 waist of the two - dimensional correlation peak to fuzziest .",
    "ranking excluded all double exposures caused by paired clumps of speckles , and most of the images with fuzzy limbs or gross distortions .",
    "some images deemed acceptable were in fact distorted ( `` looming '' ) , rotated , or blurred over part of their area .",
    "these were rejected in the next step after we had loaded the nominally best 500 from the combined stack of all strings into the _ registax _ program ( widely used by amateur astronomers to stack webcam images ) to refine the cross - correlation , and hence rerank , images within a @xmath44 pixel box that spanned the planet .",
    "we selected the final set of images in this sorted sequence of @xmath45 by eye , drizzle stacking the best 20 and 13 frames from the first and second mornings , respectively , to form high signal - to - noise ratio final images with @xmath46 pixels ( fig .",
    "[ fig : soar - images - of ] , _ left images _ ) . after setting the scale of wavelet number 1 to encompass noise",
    ", we attenuated its amplitude while boosting wavelet scales @xmath47 . the result",
    "( fig . 1 , _ middle images _ ) equaled our expectations from a blurred , @xmath48 fwhm version of a _ mariner _ full disk image .",
    "as an alternative to wavelets , we used the smart sharpening filter in photoshop cs3 followed by @xmath49 iterations of richardson - lucy deconvolution ( fig .  1 , _",
    "right images _ , @xcite ) to further sharpen bright features but now non - uniquely and with some added noise .",
    "we did not dig out features along the terminator beyond those immediately apparent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : soar - images - of ] , _ arrows _ ) because this would have required a much larger final image stack to attain resolution above the rayleigh limit @xcite , and because topography within @xmath26 of the march 23 terminator had been mapped by _",
    "we drew a circle around the planet image of the correct radial scale and found its center to @xmath50 pixel . to reduce the phase - dependent planetary illumination to map albedo variations , we weighted image intensities by multiplicative factor @xmath51^{k}$ ] with @xmath52 the latitude and @xmath53 the longitude difference from the terminator to the location on the planet and @xmath54 selected unphysically simply to improve appearances .",
    "projecting the two enhanced final images made figure [ fig : radar - topographic - and]@xmath55 , a cylindrical - equidistant map . between longitudes @xmath56 , we locate features to better than @xmath57 near the planetary equator and to within @xmath58 near the top of the map , these uncertainties arising from inexact centers of the half or gibbous shapes of the planet .",
    "our albedo map agrees with the fuzzier but color - calibrated one of @xcite from the 0.5 m swedish vacuum telescope used during daylight closer to the zenith .",
    "figure [ fig : montage - of - most ] places our map in the context of a mosaic of published arecibo radar images @xcite , and we highlight some agreements below .",
    "correlating images at these two frequencies is not trivial .",
    "as @xcite noted , radar images whose polarization is opposite to the transmitted beam are sensitive to sharp surface relief , not shallow gradients , while same - polarization images respond mostly to wavelength - scale surface roughness and somewhat to variations of surface dielectric properties .",
    "both image types are ambiguous across the doppler equator , but the spurious feature can be rejected by comparing to other radar scans at different sub - earth latitude or , as we show below , to our images .",
    "we tried to compare our map to the crescent image analyzed by @xcite , which overlaps somewhat with our images but has opposite illumination and foreshortening .",
    "what they saw on the bright limb would be evident in the middle of our april 1 image .",
    "the brightest feature in their image , at @xmath59 , is undetected in ours .",
    "their bright feature at @xmath60 may be associated with ours at @xmath61 .",
    "their crater at @xmath62 is our feature `` l '' .",
    "unfortunately , further comparison is unfeasible given the rapid change in brightness of topographic features as sun angles vary , and the amplification of the ccd contamination in our march 23 image that would result from the extensive image processing required to super - resolve details beyond the telescope - aperture rayleigh limit .    figures 2 and 3 reveal albedo variations tied to radar rayed craters and large dark areas .",
    "for example , dark region `` j '' in figure [ fig : montage - of - most]@xmath63 centered at @xmath64 is the huge `` basin s '' posited by @xcite .",
    "to its south and east lie bright radar craters .",
    "feature `` c '' in panel figure [ fig : radar - topographic - and]@xmath55 is a 125 km diameter crater that @xcite note as asymmetrically brightened to the north ; instead , we see an east - west extension of its bright material .",
    "bright features `` a '' in figure [ fig : montage - of - most ] form a broken ring of what radar image figure [ fig : radar - topographic - and]@xmath55 shows are rayed craters hence must be fresher than an ancient basin s. these are clearly not the encircling basin ramparts that @xcite saw shadowed at lower sun angle .",
    "indeed , @xcite found radar highlighting only on the western side of the basin , beyond the limb to us .",
    "bright regions are evident along the rest of basin s in the @xcite plus @xcite composite mount wilson image in the middle of figure [ fig : montage - of - most ] .",
    "eastward at longitudes @xmath65 , prominent bright clumps at latitudes @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are all radar craters . in our sharpest images ( and fig .",
    "[ fig : soar - images - of ] _ right images _ ) , each is a bright core surrounded by a slightly fainter splotch . in extent , they all are comparable to the largest crater ray systems imaged at high sun angle by _ mariner _ on the opposite hemisphere ( fig .  [",
    "fig : montage - of - most]@xmath63 _ left _ ) .        feature `` g '' in figure [ fig : radar - topographic - and]@xmath55 is 200 km across and seems to have radial striations , with figure [ fig : radar - topographic - and]@xmath68 showing a crisp radar crater of diameter 85 km with central peak and a muted crater more than twice as wide immediately to the south .",
    "further south still in our images in figures 2@xmath55 and 3@xmath63 is dark region  f \" centered at @xmath69 , solitudo persephones in the @xcite iau albedo map .",
    "comparable in size to the caloris basin , `` f '' is not surrounded by radar or optical bright features , so is perhaps a plain not a large impact basin with substantial ramparts .",
    "is it connected physically to `` g '' ?",
    "the right ( eastern ) side of our map spans the _ mariner _ unimaged western boundary of the caloris basin , `` b '' in figure [ fig : montage - of - most ] .",
    "its floor seems to be composed of multiple dark regions .",
    "but , intriguingly , an only slightly brighter but still dark area extends far beyond caloris , poleward in a diagonal swath from @xmath70 to @xmath71 ; this is the classical hermean albedo feature solitudo phoenicis in the iau map @xcite . in fact , despite the lack of photometric calibration , the _ mariner _ mosaic figure 4 _ ( right ) _ shows that this high - latitude darkening continues eastward to longitude @xmath72 .    comparing figure [ fig : radar - topographic - and]@xmath55 and @xmath68",
    ", we see that the dark area sometimes coincides with a change in radar surface texture and has a sharp radar boundary between @xmath73 .",
    "the dark region seems to be devoid of prominent rayed craters , implying relatively recent origin , with a striking exception : bright `` island d '' in figure [ fig : montage - of - most ] spans @xmath74 ( 350 km ) at the end of slightly dimmer iau hermean region liguria @xcite .",
    "the closest radar feature in figure 2@xmath75 is a fresh crater at @xmath76 , which is , however , several degrees east of our eastern feature .",
    "the optically much brighter western feature at @xmath77 is an inconspicuous 20 km diameter radar crater that seems to sit on a larger degraded crater ( fig .",
    "2d ) ; its lack of correlation with a prominent radar crater is similar to the situation for the brightest feature in the mount wilson images ( fig .  3 , _ middle _ ) .",
    "on april 1  d \" lay only @xmath78 from the terminator , yet was still so bright that it appears in figure [ fig : soar - images - of ] to protrude into the shadowed area ( arrow `` c '' ) .",
    "we propose the name `` mistral '' for the sharp , optically bright 20 km diameter crater at @xmath77 .    in our march",
    "23 image , another dark region , solitudo atlantis @xcite , is evident to the south and east , and is bounded to the west by isolated rayed craters near @xmath79 .",
    "this region is mottled , indicating its incipient resolution into partially shadowed craters .",
    "indeed , the illuminated western ramparts of the large crater mozart are just detectable ( arrow `` b '' ) in figure [ fig : soar - images - of ] . finally , dark patch ",
    "a \" @xmath80 near the terminator in figure 2 is a region without published radar data .",
    "@xcite discovered and argued for this huge ( `` skinakas '' ) basin , centering it at @xmath81 , @xmath82 south of our estimate ( which , being at the limb , is less accurate ) .",
    "both halves appear near the terminator in the images of @xcite and @xcite , respectively , and make it comparable in size to caloris",
    ". it may be bigger : @xcite showed that the intensity cut across the middle of this structure is consistent with two concentric rings of ramparts that extend into the quadrant that we observed on april 1 .",
    "exceeding in extent the lunar south pole - aitken feature , if a true impact structure it would be one of the largest basins in the solar system .",
    "the formation of caloris was the culminating event in the _ mariner _ derived stratigraphy of mercury . @xcite",
    "assert that basin s has a degraded appearance , implying that it is older than caloris .",
    "the ejecta deposits of basin s would probably not extend far enough to over / underlap those from caloris ( permitting direct relative dating from _ messenger _ spacecraft imagery during its 2008 gravity - assist flybys of mercury ) .",
    "in our april 1 image , basin s is centered near the bright limb . within it ,",
    "radar shows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : montage - of - most]@xmath55 ) a few intermediate size craters and indeed we see a bright one , `` k '' , that may be what @xcite attributed as its central peak ( which would be an impact signature ) .",
    "but the northern half of basin s is certainly dark even at high sun angle , and is surrounded on its visible south and east sides by bright craters , for example , `` a '' .",
    "in fact , radar craters account for all the optical bright spots ; there are no signs of boundary ramparts on the e side visible to us .",
    "to the west beyond our limb , @xcite find radar highlights and speculate that these may be the inner western rim of basin s. there is no sign in the _ mariner _ imagery of hilly `` weird terrain '' at the putative basin s antipode as is the case for caloris .      as mentioned in   3 ,",
    "a dark swath in the 2007 march 23 image extends westward at reduced prominence in the april 1 image and eastward in the _ mariner _ mosaic ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the boundary between lower and higher albedo regions is sharp , as is the boundary of the `` island '' of bright features `` d '' .",
    "the radar image figure [ fig : radar - topographic - and]@xmath68 also shows a sharp boundary , but only between @xmath73 does it coincide with the albedo change .",
    "the darker `` cap '' is a striking asymmetry across mercury ; there are indications of a counterpart darkening at high southern latitudes in figure [ fig : montage - of - most]@xmath63 .",
    "is it superficial , a result of space weathering that darkens and/or reddens an exposed surface ?",
    "we have only monochrome red images , so can not map colors .",
    "one way to darken the surface is an enhanced influx of charged particles near the magnetic poles @xcite , although mercury s field is supposed to be strong enough to keep the solar wind from reaching the surface most of the time @xcite .",
    "alternatively , equatorial and lower latitude regions could be reddened ( hence brightened in our filter ) relative to the poles by weathering from enhanced solar irradiation @xcite .",
    "if the darkening is instead due to a fundamental change in surface properties ( as suggested by the change in radar texture ) , this asymmetry would cause mercury to resemble the other terrestrial planets .",
    "how volcanism may have shaped the planet s surface is controversial .",
    "no definitive volcanic feature was identified even in _ mariner 10 _ close - ups .",
    "a non - lunar aspect is the extensive distribution of inter - crater plains , attributed to either volcanism or obscuring basin ejecta .",
    "@xcite attempted to calibrate the compromised _ mariner 10 _ two - filter photometry , and have compared the resulting color variations to lunar measurements . in their view , changes in surface color are due both to space weathering and to intrinsic compositional variations consistent with volcanic fire fountains .",
    "long - term volcanism is a possibility following the radar measurements by @xcite of variations in the planet s forced longitudinal libration that are consistent with mantle slippage inertia over a partially molten core .",
    "such a core structure also explains the weak magnetic field discovered by _",
    "mariner_. ( alternatively , @xcite noted that _ mariner 10 _ passed over basin s , and posit that the measured field is a relic of this putative impact . ) the absence of global tectonics other than the overall contraction inferred from planet - wide scarps @xcite may permit substantial volcanic structures to accumulate slowly over time , not just as fire fountains in the distant past .",
    "shield volcanoes could be flat enough to be subtle in existing radar images that are sensitive only to short - wavelength tilts ; radar altimetry @xcite has not spanned large areas of the planet .",
    "nevertheless , all bright features in our map can be attributed to rays or ramparts of radar craters .",
    "our  lucky image \" stacks bettered @xmath83 resolution and have mapped prominent rayed craters and other features across part of the hemisphere unseen by _ mariner 10 _ but subsequently imaged by radar .",
    "the region complements that studied by @xcite also using short exposure stacks .",
    "they and @xcite have posited a large dark feature ( `` basin s '' or `` skinakas basin '' ) near @xmath84 .",
    "although we observed it near the limb , we do see its darker floor even at the high sun angle that brightens some adjacent craters . however , we find only bright radar craters around it , and no features that could be attributed to basin ramparts on its eastern boundary .",
    "several topographic features are observed at the terminator , including ramparts of the large crater mozart . a very bright spot that is a sharp radar crater lies within a dark swath that extends across at least @xmath4 longitude at latitudes reaching northward of @xmath85 at @xmath86 longitude to northward of @xmath87 latitude at @xmath88 .",
    "no other prominent rayed craters , even at higher sun angles , lie within this region . starting in 2011 , _",
