    "the recent discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite confirms that the higgs mechanism is responsible for spontaneously breaking electroweak symmetry in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , the question of whether the higgs sector is natural or not remains to be answered .",
    "the two most appealing solutions for stabilising the weak scale are supersymmetry ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) and compositeness @xcite .",
    "both are now constrained by measurements of the higgs mass and its couplings , which have led to consequences for the spectrum of exotic states predicted in these two scenarios . in supersymmetric models",
    "the radiative corrections from coloured states , such as the stop and gluino , have been extensively studied in the literature and shown to have an important effect on tuning in the higgs sector .",
    "combined with the lower limits on sparticle masses from the lhc , the conclusion is that supersymmetric models are now tuned to below the 5@xmath0 level @xcite .",
    "exotic coloured states also exist in composite higgs models and can similarly play an important role in determining the higgs mass . in many of these models",
    "the sm higgs doublet is identified with nambu - goldstone modes , arising from the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry group @xmath1 to a subgroup @xmath2 due to some strong dynamics .",
    "however , the original global symmetry is also explicitly broken via mixing between operators in the strongly coupled sector and elementary fields in the sm sector , as the latter need not come in complete representations of @xmath1 .",
    "hence a coleman - weinberg type potential is generated , leading to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and a mass for the higgs boson @xcite .",
    "a key component in such models is the existence of composite , fermionic top partner resonances in the low energy spectrum .",
    "they are required to facilitate a strong coupling between the top quark and the composite higgs ( through substantial mixing between composite and elementary states in the top sector ) and , often , to break electroweak symmetry in the first place .",
    "the scale of the higgs mass is typically set by these top partner masses so , to provide a higgs mass of around 126 gev @xcite , the top partners can not be too heavy . including such coloured fermionic resonances",
    "generically implies that there will also be coloured vector meson resonances in the low energy spectrum .",
    "this follows because , even though a complete description of the underlying dynamics of the strong sector remains unknown , the constituents of the strong sector must be coloured in order to produce top partner bound states charged under @xmath3 colour .",
    "consequently , the strong sector is also expected to produce coloured vector mesons that necessarily couple to any top partner bound state .",
    "we will refer to these states as gluon partners .",
    "indeed , if the strong sector contains a fermionic operator @xmath4 , in the fundamental representation of @xmath3 so as to produce top partners , one can always write down a vector operator @xmath5 in the adjoint representation of @xmath3 .",
    "equivalently , in the five - dimensional ( 5d ) version of these composite higgs models @xcite the gluon partners are simply the kaluza - klein gluons , which are required by 5d gauge invariance if the sm fermions are located in the bulk .    thus far the contribution of gluon partners to the higgs mass has been neglected .",
    "since they only couple to the higgs through the top partners , the size of the correction to the higgs mass will be proportional to the gluon partner - top partner coupling , @xmath6 .",
    "this coupling can be estimated either through direct calculations in the 5d theory @xcite or via holographic techniques @xcite . in both instances",
    "the coupling is large , hence the contribution to the higgs mass is expected to be sizeable .    in this paper",
    "we explicitly compute the leading order correction and do indeed find it to be important . specifically",
    ", we calculate the one - loop correction to the two - point function of ( dirac ) top partners coming from a massive gluon partner .",
    "this first result is model independent but , to quantify the effect on the higgs mass , we apply it to the specific example of the mchm@xmath7 .",
    "interestingly , we find that the higgs mass is decreased in this particular model , thereby easing some of the tension between the tuning in composite higgs models and the non - observation of coloured top partners . for a gluon partner of mass 3",
    "tev , a spontaneous global symmetry breaking scale of about 750 gev and with the higgs mass fixed at 126 gev , the top partners are about 10% heavier than in the uncorrected model .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider gluon partners in a general composite higgs model .",
    "the one - loop radiative correction from a gluon partner to the two - point function is first estimated in the large @xmath8 limit and then the exact calculation is performed with the final result expressed in integral form .",
    "the exact result is used in section 3 to compute the contribution to the composite higgs mass in the mchm@xmath7 .",
    "the concluding remarks are presented in section 4 . in appendix",
    "a we use the holographic basis to estimate the size of the radiative correction , and in appendix b we list the passarino - veltman integral expressions utilised earlier in the paper .",
    "many composite higgs models consists of a strong sector that is responsible for producing a set of nambu - goldstone bosons , a combination of which is identified with the higgs boson , @xmath9 .",
    "the strong sector is joined by an elementary sector containing the sm fermions and gauge bosons , and the two sectors are assumed to mix only through bilinear couplings [ eq : lmix ] _",
    "mix=|q_l_r+|t_r_l+a_g^_+  where the elementary fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the left handed top quark doublet , right handed top and gluon respectively . we have only included the fermionic operators @xmath12 and the strong sector @xmath3 colour current @xmath13 ; the dots represent other bilinear couplings which will not be considered here , such as those for the light fermions .    integrating out the strong sector results in an effective lagrangian for the top - higgs sector @xcite",

    "the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are determined by two - point functions of the fermionic operators @xmath18 up to a factor of @xmath19 in @xmath20 coming from the usual sm kinetic term ( i.e.  @xmath21 ) . assuming the strong sector is a large @xmath8 gauge theory and working to leading order in @xmath22 , one can write these two - point functions as a sum over narrow , top partner resonances , @xmath23 , to find @xmath24 for masses @xmath25 , constant form factors @xmath26 and where the coefficients @xmath27 are derived from the group structure of any particular model . their precise form and that of their prefactors , the functions @xmath28 of the higgs fields , are determined by the details of the global symmetry breaking pattern and the representations into which the top quarks are embedded",
    ". however , they can always be split into those components that are sensitive to the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and those that are not , hence @xmath29 .",
    "since the top quarks do not make up full representations of the global symmetry group in the strong sector , the symmetry is explicitly broken and a potential can be generated for the erstwhile nambu - goldstone bosons . at one loop",
    "the potential from the top sector is given by @xmath30}{\\left[\\pi^0_r(p_e^2)+{\\cal      y}_r(h / f)\\pi_r^h(p_e^2)\\right]}\\right .",

    "expanding the logarithm and discarding the constant term gives an approximate form for the potential @xmath33,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be considered an expansion in @xmath28 ( corresponding to a small higgs vev ) or an expansion in @xmath34 and @xmath17 ( corresponding to weak mixing between elementary and composite degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the strong sector , which are required to mix with the top quark , guarantee the existence of top partners in this framework .",
    "however , as argued in the introduction , they are typically accompanied by massive , coloured vector meson resonances , or gluon partners .",
    "these are associated with the strong sector current operator @xmath13 as , at leading order in @xmath22 , the two - point function @xmath37 can be written as a sum over narrow gluon resonances , @xmath38 , much like the two - point functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "because the higgs is colour neutral , any correction to its mass from gluon partners must enter , at two - loop order , through the two - point functions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "three - point function ( which already comes with an extra @xmath39 suppression ) must vanish and the vertex correction is suppressed by several additional composite - elementary mixing factors .",
    "] this means the effect can be accounted for by calculating the gluon partner corrections to the functions @xmath17 and @xmath16 , defined in eq .   in the large @xmath8 limit .",
    "a naive large @xmath8 analysis suggests that the correction is not important because it depends on a @xmath40 coupling in the strong sector , which scales like @xmath39 .",
    "however , this is only a scaling dependence and ignores the prefactor for the coupling , which we will now show is large . to estimate the importance of the correction",
    "more accurately we will use the ads / cft correspondence to estimate the strength of couplings in the strong sector , then use large @xmath8 results to estimate the amplitudes of the relevant diagrams .    in theories of warped extra dimensions",
    "one can relate the @xmath8 appearing in the large @xmath8 cft expansion with the 5d gauge couplings using @xcite [ eq : ngauge ] = =( ) , where @xmath41 is the curvature scale of the 5d warped ads space , @xmath42 a bulk gauge coupling , @xmath43 a four - dimensional ( 4d ) gauge coupling and @xmath44 a numerical factor distinguishing between different gauge groups .",
    "we have also made use of the relation between 5d and 4d gauge couplings @xmath45 , which includes the logarithmic running between the uv and the ir scales .",
    "the expression can be used to provide quantitative information about the strength of the couplings between resonances in the strong sector .    to estimate the coupling between the top partner and the gluon partner , we first use the @xmath3 gauge coupling to obtain the value for @xmath46 .",
    "using one finds [ eq : gn ] = ( ) , where @xmath47 is the qcd gauge coupling strength and @xmath48 .",
    "thus the coupling between the fermionic and gluon resonances can be estimated as [ eq : alphag ] _ g3 .",
    "this compares well with the exact 5d calculation @xcite , where the overlap integral between the first kaluza - klein gluon and the first kaluza - klein top gives @xmath49 . , which implies @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the strong coupling evaluated at the scale @xmath15 .",
    "in this region of parameter space one recovers the usual kaluza - klein fermion spectrum for unmixed boundary conditions . ]",
    "note that in the estimate we have neglected sm loop and brane kinetic term contributions to the 4d coupling .",
    "these contributions are model dependent and can increase or decrease the coupling @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "for example , if the sm loop contributions are not cancelled by uv brane kinetic terms then the value of the coupling @xmath6 is reduced by approximately 1/4 . to avoid model dependency",
    "we will assume the value for concreteness in the rest of this paper .",
    "limit.[fig : selfenergy],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] +    limit.[fig : selfenergy],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    now the coupling can be used to estimate the size of the one - loop gluon partner contribution to the two - point functions relative to that of the tree - level contribution : [ eq : ratio ] = . the expression on the left hand side",
    "is obtained using the large @xmath8 result @xmath52 for the tree - level contribution in the denominator ( the top diagram in figure [ fig : selfenergy ] ) .",
    "for the one - loop gluon partner contribution in the numerator ( the bottom diagram in figure [ fig : selfenergy ] ) there are two vertices coupling top partners to a gluon partner , each contributing a factor of @xmath53 , an additional loop factor @xmath54 , as well as the quadratic casimir @xmath55 ( coming from @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are the generators of @xmath3 in the fundamental representation ) .",
    "finally , we substitute in the estimated value for @xmath58 from eq .   to get a numerical value .    despite being a higher order effect",
    ", we find that the contribution due to the gluon partners could be of order @xmath59 . an alternative derivation , based on the mixing between the holographic and mass bases and yielding the same result , is presented in the appendix .",
    "note that these estimates neglect a momentum dependent loop function , which will be explicitly computed in the next section .       from a gluon partner @xmath1.[fig : selfenergyc],scaledwidth=27.0% ]    to fully quantify the effect of gluon partners on the higgs mass we must calculate the contribution from figure [ fig : selfenergyc ] explicitly .",
    "this assumes that the gluon partners associated with the current @xmath13 can be modelled as narrow resonances , like their fermionic brethren .",
    "each top partner propagator is renormalised to [ eq : sr ] s^-1(p)=s^-1_0(p)+i_1(p ) , at one - loop order , where @xmath60 is the unrenormalised propagator and @xmath61 is the one - loop renormalised self energy .",
    "including appropriate counterterms for the wave function and mass renormalisation , this self energy is given by [ eq : sigmar ] _",
    "1(p)=(p)-(-m_q)z_2-m_q , where [ eq : sigmal ] i(p)=_g^^ , is the integral expression obtained from the diagram in figure [ fig : selfenergyc ] .",
    "renormalising the propagator in the on - shell scheme gives the two renormalisation conditions @xmath62 which are used to determine the two counter terms @xmath63 and @xmath64 . by writing ( p)=m_qa(p^2)+b(p^2 ) , then solving the above equations and substituting into eqs .   and , we find the one - loop expression [ eq : prop ] is^-1(p)=(1-(p^2)+.m_q|_=m_q)(-m_q ) , where we have further defined @xmath65 the first factor in is absorbed into an overall rescaling of the top partner fields and is not important for our purposes . the second term can be expressed in the propagator as an effective correction to the top partner mass m_q(p^2)=m_q .",
    "we now need to evaluate eq .",
    "to determine the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the answer is succinctly expressed in terms of passarino - veltman integrals @xcite ( see the appendix ) @xmath68[(k - p)^2-m_g^2 ] } \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{2i\\alpha_g}{3\\pi}{\\left[2m_qb_0(p^2,m_q^2,m_g^2)+\\slashed{p}b_1(p^2,m_q^2,m_g^2)\\right]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and therefore @xmath69 } , \\\\",

    "this one - loop result can be easily generalised to include contributions from multiple gluon partners by replacing the above expression with a sum of identical terms , each using different values for @xmath6 and @xmath70 .",
    "however , we expect that the lightest gluon partner will always dominate because the loop integral can be seen to decrease as the gluon partner mass is increased , and the coupling is expected to behave similarly ( this latter effect can be seen explicitly in the 5d calculation ) .",
    "in addition to the coloured contribution we can estimate the equivalent non - coloured contribution arising from the electroweak resonances . using the relation we obtain [ eq : gnw ] = ( ) , where @xmath71 is the electroweak coupling strength and , for simplicity , we have set @xmath72 , corresponding to a redefinition of @xmath8 .",
    "this enables us to estimate the coupling @xmath73 of the top partner fermions with the electroweak vector mesons . using eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath74 .",
    "this is a factor of three smaller than the gluon coupling .",
    "the ratio of the electroweak resonance correction relative to that of the gluon partner correction is then @xmath75/[\\alpha_gc_2(3 ) ] \\simeq 3/16 $ ] , where we have further used the @xmath76 quadratic casimir @xmath77 .",
    "thus the correction coming from electroweak vector mesons is much less important than the gluon partner correction , and will henceforth be neglected .",
    ", for example , the mass limit on the electroweak resonances is not that stringent @xcite so there is no real limit on the gluon partner masses coming from this observation . ]",
    "having gone beyond leading order in @xmath22 one may anticipate that other corrections to the higgs potential , beyond the simple mass shift of eq .",
    ", should be considered . while such corrections do exist , and are at the same order in @xmath22 , they will always be subdominant .",
    "the reason is that the correction calculated above is the only one proportional to the top partner - gluon partner coupling @xmath6 , in contrast to other corrections which go like @xmath78 or just @xmath79 .",
    "the couplings in the coloured sector satisfy @xmath80 , as shown in the previous subsection , hence any other corrections coming from this sector can be neglected .",
    "the situation is even more acute in the non - coloured sector , as these corrections suffer a similar suppression from the reduced coupling strength , and do not even benefit from qcd multiplicity factors when evaluating loops .",
    "another correction one might consider beyond leading order in @xmath22 is a wave function renormalisation of the higgs .",
    "however , in this framework the higgs always appears in the ratio @xmath81 , meaning that any wave function renormalisation is simply absorbed in a rescaling of the symmetry breaking scale .    while the above arguments are robust in the models we are considering here , where the strong sector only communicates with elementary fields through bilinear couplings like those in eq .",
    ", they do not immediately apply in more general models . then",
    ", there may be other corrections to the higgs mass of similar importance .",
    "however , it should be noted that the effective lagrangian will no longer apply either .",

    "one then uses the renormalised functions @xmath87 to calculate the higgs potential in eq .  .",
    "leaving these functions as they are , i.e.  not expanding in @xmath6 again , ensures that the approximation remains good at high momentum , and corresponds to consistently resumming all contributions generated by the 1pi diagram in figure [ fig : selfenergyc ] .",
    "this is easily seen to be the leading order effect .",
    "note also that , since the correction shows up as a mass shift only , all of the group structure is preserved and we can simply apply existing results to calculate the higgs mass with no need to worry about the theory becoming non - renormalisable .",
    "this may not have been the case if the renormalisation procedure had introduced momentum dependence into the @xmath88 s .",
    "to get an idea how the form factors are changed , we evaluate eq .   with a single top partner , a single gluon partner , and with all unknown constants fixed using a normalisation respecting eq .",
    "this results in form factors behaving as in figure [ fig : mplot ] . the corrected form factor @xmath89 ( that provides the top quark yukawa ) is seen to decrease relative to the uncorrected form factor at low momentum , but it then crosses zero and continues to decrease to a magnitude bigger than the uncorrected function .",
    "this does not imply that the one - loop result has become unreliable , as the expansion parameter when renormalising the propagator goes like @xmath90 , which is still much less than one at large momentum .",
    "meanwhile the corrected form factor @xmath91 displays the opposite behaviour ; it is seen to increase relative to the uncorrected form factor at low momentum , but it decays more quickly so ends up smaller than the uncorrected function at high momentum .    the way that these form factors appear in the higgs potential is model dependent so we can not make a universal statement about how the gluon partner correction changes the higgs mass . even for a specific model",
    "it is not obvious what will happen .",
    "only the magnitude of @xmath89 appears in eq .  , so there is always some cancellation when performing the momentum integral and it is not immediately apparent whether the higgs mass will be increased or decreased .",
    "a similar cancellation occurs when integrating @xmath91 , and the situation is further complicated by including more top parters , whereupon there can be cancellations in the expressions even before integrating over momentum .",
    "nonetheless , eqs .   and are all that is needed to calculate the leading order gluon partner correction to the higgs mass in any model of this form .    as a specific example we now consider the minimal composite higgs model ( mchm ) .",

    "the gluon partners are expected to couple strongly to the top partners , and this expectation is quantitatively confirmed by arguments based on holography .",
    "they can therefore provide a significant correction to the composite higgs mass .",
    "the leading order correction is parameterised by a momentum dependent top partner mass shift in the two - point functions of the strong sector , which we have explicitly calculated in this paper . the final effect on the higgs mass is model",
    "dependent , but we find a decrease in the higgs mass in the mchm@xmath94 .",
    "this means that the mass of the top partners required to yield a 126 gev higgs is increased by about 10% ( for a 3 tev gluon partner and a spontaneous global symmetry breaking scale of about 750 gev ) easing constraints from direct collider searches for top partners .",

    "let us assume that the strong sector only produces one gluon partner , @xmath117 , that mixes with the elementary gluon , @xmath118 , so that the mass eigenstates can be written as @xmath119 where @xmath11 is the ( massless ) physical gluon and @xmath1 is the massive gluon .",
