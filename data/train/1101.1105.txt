    "phase transitions to a single absorbing configuration , a state in which the system can not scape from , are nowadays a topic in the frontier of nonequilibrium statistical physics @xcite . concomitantly with the increasing interest on absorbing / active phase transitions in complex topologies @xcite , there are still a lot of open problems being intensively investigated on regular lattices such as the effects of quenched disorder @xcite , diffusion @xcite , as well the modeling of predator - prey systems @xcite , and clonal replication @xcite .    under the renormalization group point of view , it is expected @xcite that the absorbing phase transitions in models with a positive one - component order parameter , short - range interactions and without additional symmetries or quenched disorder belong generally to the universality class of directed percolation ( dp ) .",
    "this conjecture is known as janssen - grassberger criterion @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention , the interest on this kind of phase transitions was raised by the recent experimental observation of the dp class in absorbing - state phase transitions @xcite . on the other hand , while dp is considered the most robust universality class of the absorbing - state phase transitions , the precise numerical determination of the critical exponents of a specific model can be masked by factors like diffusion@xcite and weak quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "the contact process ( cp ) , the standard example of the dp universality class , is a toy model of epidemics @xcite .. more recently , a novel variation of the cp was introduced for the modeling of clonal ( copies of themselves ) replication , the contact replication process ( crp ) @xcite .",
    "since neither additional symmetries nor long - range interactions were included , the crp fulfils the requirements of the janssen - gassberger criterion . however , the first dynamic spreading analysis of crp in @xmath1 dimensions , reported in @xcite intriguingly classified the model in the dp universality class in one and two , but not in three dimensions . surprisingly , in @xmath0 the reported spreading exponents were those predicted by the mean - field approach @xcite .    in the present work we applied spreading analysis and the method of quasi - stationary simulations @xcite in three - dimensional models that fulfill the janssen - grassberger criterion . particularly , we turned back to the crp model and showed that the mean - field behaviour observed previously in @xmath0 @xcite is a transient associated to the closeness between critical creation and annihilation events .",
    "additionally , we have analysed several moment ratios in @xmath0 and have determined the universal values for dp class based on the results obtained from cp and sis models .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in section [ model ] , the models and simulation procedures are described .",
    "simulation results are presented and discussed in section [ result ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the _ contact process _ ( cp ) is defined in a hypercubic lattice @xmath2 in which the sites represent individuals in two states : healthy ( @xmath3 ) or infected ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "infected sites become healthy ( empty ) at unitary rate @xmath5 while healthy sites are infected at a rate @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the lattice coordination number and @xmath8 the number of infected sites surrounding ( first - neighbours in the distance ) the healthy site @xmath9 .",
    "these rules implies , for values of infection rate above a certain @xmath10 , an infection flowing equally distributed among all nearest neighbours ( nn ) of infected sites .",
    "the _ susceptible - infected - susceptible _ model is a variation of the cp dynamics in which any empty site with one or more infected nearest - neighbours becomes infected at rate @xmath11 .",
    "again , a unitary cure rate is assumed . in the literature ,",
    "the sis model is also known as the a model @xcite .",
    "_ contact replication process _",
    "rules are are very similar to those of cp . instead of individuals ,",
    "the sites represent places where cells lie .",
    "analogously to the spontaneous cure in cp , cells die at unitary rate .",
    "however , a cell replicates at a rate @xmath11 and the offspring occupies one of its empty nn chosen at random .",
    "so , an empty site @xmath9 is occupied at rate @xmath12 .",
    "the sum is done over all neighbours of the site @xmath9 and @xmath13 is defined as before .",
    "notice that the creation process is facilitated in the crp in relation to cp since the occupation flows uniformly among only empty neighbours implying lower critical rates .",
    "indeed , estimates reported for crp were @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for @xmath16 and 3 @xcite , in comparison with those for the cp @xmath17 and 1.31686(1 ) @xcite , respectively .",
    "notice that the three models share the same symmetries and , consequently , they are expected to belong to the same universality class .",
    "for all these models , monte carlo simulations were performed using the usual procedure @xcite : an event , creation or annihilation , is selected with probabilities @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , and an occupied site @xmath9 is chosen at random . in the annihilation process ,",
    "the occupied site become empty in all models while the creation depends on model . in cp",
    ", one nearest - neighbour ( nn ) of @xmath9 is chosen at random and infected if empty , otherwise nothing occurs . in sis",
    ", all empty sites neighbouring the site @xmath9 are occupied .",
    "finally , in crp one of empty neighbours , if there are anyone , is chosen at random and occupied . in all cases , the time is incremented by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is total number of infected sites .",
    "stationary analysis of systems with transitions to absorbing configurations in the proximity of the critical point are ruled by strong finite size effects .",
    "indeed , the unique actual stationary state of finite systems is the absorbing one . a common alternative to avoid",
    "this difficulty is to restrict the averages to the survival samples and apply a finite size analysis .",
    "however , such procedure is not free of ambiguities or misinterpretations @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is the quasi - stationary qs simulation method @xcite .",
    "this method consists of storing a list with @xmath22 configurations visited in the history of the system and periodically replacing one of them by the current state .",
    "whenever the system try to visit the absorbing state , the configuration is replaced by an active one selected at random from the list containing the sample of configurations and the simulation continues as usually .",
    "the qs simulations were performed as follows .",
    "firstly , the list of configurations is incremented whenever the time increases by a unity up to a list with @xmath22 configurations is achieved .",
    "secondly , a configuration of the list randomly chosen is replaced by the current one with a given probability @xmath23 .",
    "we used a large value of @xmath24 for a initial relaxation period , more precisely for @xmath25 aiming to speed up the erasing of the memory of the initial conditions . in turn",
    ", @xmath26 was adopted for the remaining of the simulation",
    ". runs with @xmath27 steps and averages after a relaxation time @xmath28 were used .",
    "finally , the averages and uncertainties were obtained with at least @xmath29 ( to the largest system ) independent runs with a full lattice as initial condition .",
    "periodic boundary condition were always used .",
    "the critical point @xmath10 can be efficiently determined by the spreading analysis , which consists of evolving the system from a perturbation to the absorbing state ( a single occupied site at the origin of the lattice ) and computing the survival probability @xmath30 and mean number of occupied sites @xmath21 as time functions . in this analysis ,",
    "the averages are done over all samples , surviving or not .",
    "asymptotic power law dependencies , @xmath31 are expected at criticality .",
    "since @xmath32 at upper - critical and exponentially decays in the sub - critical regimes , deviations from power laws are expected around the critical point and a null curvature criterion of the double - logarithm plots of @xmath21 against @xmath33 can be used to determine the critical point @xcite .",
    "analogous analysis can be done with the survival probability .",
    "the spreading is defined by @xmath34 in which @xmath35 is the distance from the original seed where the perturbation was introduced . at criticality",
    ", it is expected an asymptotic power law @xmath36 the spreading exponents obey a hyperscaling relation @xmath37 @xcite .    in order to illustrate the method , we present results from quasi - stationary simulations of the two - dimensional crp model .",
    "the qs density vanishes as usual at @xmath38 when @xmath39 ( the critical rate were determined using the spreading analysis ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the critical densities and lifetimes of the qs state versus system size .",
    "lifetime was calculated as @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the probability of attempting the absorbing configuration in qs simulations .",
    "the power laws @xmath42 and @xmath43 were verified and the slopes for @xmath44 provide @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "as expected , these exponents are in very good accordance with those reported for the dp universality class @xcite ( table [ exponents ] ) .",
    "also , the critical variance of the order parameter , defined by @xmath47 @xcite , scales as @xmath48 with an exponent @xmath49 , again agreing with the dp value .",
    "the ratio between moments of the order parameter is widespread as an useful tool for the determination of the critical point of equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "this concept has been extended to non - equilibrium systems , particularly to models belonging to the dp universality class for which the moment and cumulant ratios have proven to be universal quantities @xcite .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig1](b ) shows the ratio @xmath50 for the two - dimensional crp model at criticality for varying system sizes .",
    "it was shown that this ratio assumes the critical value @xmath51 for cp in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "using data for @xmath52 we found @xmath53 for two - dimensional crp , again in accordance with dp universality class . additionally , we also verified the agreement of higher moment ratios with the predictions for dp classes for @xmath54 and 2 .",

    "notice that all of them are consistent with dp class , although data are deviated from pure power laws for small sizes .",
    "this effect can be taken in to account with a suitable correction to the amplitude of the scale law for lifetime given by @xcite @xmath71 and so on for the others qs quantities .",
    "actually , our results are not significantly affected by the particular choice of the correction .",
    "the value @xmath72 was established for cp in @xmath54 @xcite and also adopted here for @xmath0 . using this correction , the exponents are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for contact process representing a significant reduction of the error estimates and an improvement of the closeness with dp class .",
    "for the sis model , the correction to the scaling provides @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , an even better improvement of the estimates as well as their proximities with dp class . in left panel of figure [ fig : qscp_a ] , the rescalings by pure power laws , @xmath79 and so on , are compared with those given by ( [ eq : correction ] ) .",

    "firstly , we recalculated the critical point determination using spreading analysis and found a value approximately 0.3% larger than the originally reported @xcite . using the criterion of downward and upward curvatures of the plots @xmath82 ,",
    "our best estimate is @xmath83 .",
    "this small discrepancy is central since this certainly excludes the equality between creation and annihilation critical rates .",
    "the curves @xmath84 and @xmath85 have transients consistent with the dp mean - field exponents ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) , in agreement with the previously reported crp simulations @xcite .",
    "even though a large power interval was not obtained for the largest time simulated , the exponents fitted in the interval @xmath86 , namely , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , do not exclude the dp class ( table [ exponents ] ) .",
    "additionally , the critical density for a fully occupied initial configuration decays as @xmath90 for @xmath91 , in excellent agreement with dp class ( inset of figure [ fig : fig2 ] )",
    ".     +    results of qs simulations for the crp model at the critical point are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the qs exponents obtained from fits in the range @xmath44 are @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 which are not concluding about the agreement with the dp universality class . however , with exception of the lifetime , the exponents seem converging to the dp value . applying a correction to the scaling ( [ eq : correction ] ) , the corrected exponents for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , are closer to dp class .",
    "the lifetime analysis deserves some comments .",
    "the qs method used in present work , involves the transition to the absorbing configuration passing by the state with a single occupied site . in the critical crp",
    ", the creation event occurs with a frequency slightly larger than the annihilation , which can be easily verified from the model critical rate together with its rules .",
    "consequently , large clusters of occupied sites are much more seldom in crp than in cp and , mainly , in sis models implying in a too small frequency of visiting the pre - absorbing state ( figure [ fig : a_cp_crp ] )",
    ". moreover , the average time that a sample is kept in the list containing the system history , given by @xmath99 , must be much larger than the sample lifetime , @xmath100 , to avoid a same run anomalously contributing many times to the list of configurations @xcite . obviously , this effect is enhanced as the system size increases .",
    "thus , a computationally prohibitive small @xmath23 and/or large @xmath22 together with too large relaxation and averaging times are demanded . instead of lifetime",
    ", we can determine the characteristic time @xmath101 to the density reaches the qs state in conventional qs simulations @xcite .",

    "critical quantities normalized by the sis model .",
    "top : lifetimes as functions of the system sizes .",
    "bottom : squared spreading radius versus time .",
    "as one can see , diffusion and lifetimes are enhanced in crp model.,width=340 ]    moments and cumulants for dp class in @xmath104 with a homogeneous constant external source were recently reported by janssen _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "so , let us introduce the notation @xmath105 and @xmath106 to the @xmath107th moment and cumulant of the order parameter , respectively .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath108 and @xmath109 dickman and da silva @xcite showed that the ratios @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 assume universal values for dp class in @xmath54 and @xmath55 dimensions .",
    "it is important to notice that both even and odd moments can be studied , since the order parameter is non - negative .",
    "several moment and/or cumulant ratios as functions of the system size for @xmath115 models are shown in figure [ fig : moments ] .",
    "the moment ratios for sis and cp models exhibit finite size effects , but seem to monotonically converge to a constant value when @xmath39 . assuming a correction given by @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are fit parameters , the asymptotic moment ratios can be estimated .",
    "since some data for fourth moment were ruled by very large error bars , these data were excluded from the fits . extrapolated moment ratios for cp and sis",
    "are listed in table [ moments ] and are consistent with the hypothesis of universality .",
    "it is worth to stress that ratios shown in table [ moments ] differ from those reported by janssen _",
    "et al_. @xcite since , in our studies , there is no external source .",
    "the same occurs in @xmath54 and @xmath119 when the results of janssen _",
    "et al_. @xcite are compared with those from reference @xcite .",
    "crp seems to be different from cp and sis .",
    "indeed , instead of the monotonic convergence to a constant value , the moment ratios decreases after a maximum .",
    "this difference can be again associated to the proximity between critical creation and annihilation events and the resultant high diffusivity .",
    "actually , the ratio @xmath120 first grows towards the value 1.550 .",
    "this value is nearby the established value of 1.660 for cp on a complete graph @xcite .",

    "we performed large - scale simulations of the contact process , the susceptible - infected - susceptible and the contact replication process in three dimensions . applying the quasi - stationary simulation method",

    "however , the moment ratios for crp agree with the universal dp values in @xmath54 and 2 dimensions but do not in @xmath0 .",
