    "the distinguishability of quantum theory from classical theory is formulated by heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xcite , which bounds the uncertainties about the measurement outcomes of two incompatible observables of a quantum particle .",
    "nowadays , this principle has been recast , in an information - theoretical framework , with the uncertainty quantified by entropic measures @xcite . in particular , it states @xcite that for any observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 h(q)+h(r)_2 [ eur1 ] where @xmath2 denotes the shannon entropy for the probability distribution of the measurement outcomes , @xmath3 represents the overlap between observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 the corresponding eigenvectors , respectively .",
    "since @xmath6 does not depend on specific states to be measured , the right - hand side ( rhs ) of inequality ( [ eur1 ] ) provides a fixed lower bound and more general framework of quantifying uncertainty than the standard deviations .",
    "however , using previously determined quantum information about the measured system , the above uncertainty bound could be violated .",
    "this dramatically gives a stronger entropic uncertainty relation ( eur ) which has been proved recently @xcite , followed by several experimentally confirmation @xcite .",
    "the new relation can be illustrated by the uncertainty game between two players alice and bob , where bob prepares a particle in a quantum state of his choosing and sends it to alice , who then carries out one of the two measurements and announces her choice to bob .",
    "if the particle of interest ( @xmath7 ) initially entangles with another particle , acting as a quantum memory ( @xmath8 ) carried by the observer , the new eur is expressed as s(q|b)+s(r|b)_2+s(a|b ) [ eur2 ] where @xmath9 is the conditional von neumann entropy .",
    "after the quantum system @xmath7 is measured by @xmath10 with @xmath11 , the post measurement state is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the eigenstates of the observable @xmath10 . in the extreme case , when @xmath7 and @xmath8 are maximally entangled , it is able to predict the outcomes precisely . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not entangled , the bound in ( [ eur1 ] ) is recovered .",
    "the generalization of the quantum - memory - assisted eur ( [ eur2 ] ) to rnyi entropy has also been given @xcite .",
    "other studies from various views can be found in @xcite .    in a realistic regime ,",
    "quantum systems inevitably suffer a decoherence or dissipation resulting from the interaction between the systems and the environment .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the influence of environment decoherence on quantum - memory - assisted eur , which establish nontrivial dependence on noisy channel @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we explore the eur ( [ eur2 ] ) under the decoherence rooting in the relativistic motion of quantum systems .",
    "besides the measurement the observer performed , we find the uncertainty bound in ( [ eur2 ] ) _ does _ depend on the motion state of the system . in the first scenario",
    ", we consider the bipartite system in which bob is under an uniformly acceleration relative to his inertial partner alice . since they differ in their description of a given quantum state due to the celebrated unruh effect , the concept of entropy should be observer - dependent in this situation @xcite , consequently , implying a nontrivial relativistic modification to the conditional entropy in eur ( [ eur2 ] ) . in our uncertainty game ,",
    "bob send a qubit @xmath7 , constructed from the free fermionic mode , to alice .",
    "we show that the quantum information stored initially in @xmath8 would be degraded , therefore resulting an inevitably increase of the uncertainty on the outcome of measurements carried by alice . in the limit of infinite acceleration ,",
    "the uncertainty reach a finite maximal value .",
    "this phenomenon is essentially different from that reported in @xcite where entanglement transfers between the quantum system and its environment . in our scenario ,",
    "all field modes beyond bob s acceleration horizon have to be abandoned , therefore the quantum information is completely damaged @xcite .    by utilizing the localized modes in cavity , the unruh decoherence could be prevented in either minkowskian or curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the entanglement between the cavity modes could still be generated by the nonuniform motion of the single cavity @xcite . in our second scenario , we perform the uncertainty game between alice and bob , with the particle ( qubit ) @xmath7 and quantum memory @xmath8 , each restricted in a rigid cavity , maximally entangled initially . once bob s cavity moves along a trajectory consisted of inertial and then uniformly accelerated segments , we show that the uncertainty would evolve periodically with respect to the duration of acceleration segment . with properly chosen cavity parameters , the uncertainty bound could be protected .",
    "we show explicitly how the uncertainty bound of ( [ eur2 ] ) depends on the dynamics of the cavity .",
    "moreover , our analysis admits a low - acceleration approximation , which means the results in the letter are comparable with possible real experiments .",
    "we first recall some backgrounds on unruh effect from the quantum information view @xcite . in minkowski space ,",
    "the field modes in the view of an observer with the acceleration @xmath15 should be described by rindler coordinates , dividing the whole spacetime into left and right rindler wedges by acceleration horizon .",
    "since the field modes restricted in different wedges can not be causally connected , the information loss for the accelerated observer results a thermal bath .",
    "in particular , considering fermionic field with few degrees for simplicity , the vacuum state @xmath16 and its excitation @xmath17 in minkowskian coordinates can be expressed as |0_k&=&|0_k_|0_k_+|1_k_|1_k _",
    "+    i and ii , where @xmath18 . it should be noted that @xcite , the so - called single - mode approximation ( sma ) has be imposed , which however is not correct for general states .",
    "indeed , the bogoliubov transformation ( [ bog1 ] ) corresponds a particular choice of so - called unruh mode , which are symmetric over both left and right rindler wedges .",
    "nevertheless , this approximation could work when only the main contributing mode of a well - chosen wave packet is considered @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , in the uncertainty game , bob sends alice a qubit @xmath7 , initially entangled with another his quantum memory @xmath8 . after alice measuring either @xmath0 or @xmath1 and broadcasting her measurement choice ,",
    "bob needs to minimize his uncertainty about alice s measurement outcome .    to investigate the influence of unruh effect on this game , we consider the bipartite system of alice and bob , initially being static and sharing a bell - diagonal state _",
    "^ 3c_i_i^a_i^b ) [ bell ] where @xmath19 are pauli matrix and the coefficients @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , this state reduces to maximally entangled states ( bell - basis ) if @xmath21 . following @xcite , we assume all states of alice are constructed by the field mode @xmath22 which only her detector can detect , while bob s states can be truncated from @xmath23 field modes to which his detector is sensitive .",
    "with this convention in mind , the superscripts @xmath7 and @xmath8 would have double meaning as particular observer and the field modes he / she sensitive .",
    "after their coincidence , we assume one observer move with an uniform acceleration while another one maintain static . since the accelerating observer can not access the modes beyond his / her horizon , the lost information reduces the entanglement between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , therefore change the uncertainty in ( [ eur2 ] ) . in following ,",
    "we discuss the scheme with bob ( or alice ) being under an acceleration , respectively .    in our uncertainty game , after sending alice the qubit @xmath7 maximally entangled with quantum memory @xmath8 , bob begins to move with an acceleration @xmath15 .",

    "however , the conditional von neumann entropy in ( [ eur2 ] ) would be changed , since ( [ bacc ] ) gives new post measurement states @xmath27 , restricted in region i. employing the eigenstates of pauli operators @xmath19 , we have the post measurement states _",

    "this means that the state preparation and measurement choice ( spmc ) condition for inertial system , @xmath49 @xcite , will no longer be satisfactory but should be replaced by the involved acceleration - dependent condition @xmath50 from ( [ lhs1 ] ) and ( [ rhs1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss an alternative game , in which alice accelerates after sharing ( [ bell ] ) with inertial bob . since alice would suffer the unruh effect , the local measurements on @xmath10 should be made in region i , which means a restricted projector @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the eigenstates of the observable @xmath10 in region i. the symmetric character of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in bell - diagonal state guarantees the same post measurement states as ( [ bpm1])-([bpm3 ] ) with exchange the superscripts .",

    "therefore , all results given before are still correct .",
    "we now discuss an alternative scenario in which both alice and bob are localized in rigid cavity .",

    "firstly , it is well known that the uncertainty game with unruh effect is equivalent to a similar process under hawking radiation from a black hole , since the near - horizon geometry of schwarzschild is described by same rindler coordinates .",
    "therefore our results could shed new light on the quantum physics near in a black hole background @xcite . secondly , while the uncertainty in two - cavity scenario always increases , nevertheless , by a similar analysis , uncertainty for the game localized in a single cavity could be reduced , since the entanglement between different field modes is generated periodically @xcite . for a bipartite system without entanglement initially , the eur ( [ eur1 ] ) satisfied initially should be replaced by quantum - memory - assisted eur ( [ eur2 ] ) in the final inertial segment iii. this scenario with single rigid cavity could be very instructive , according to equivalence principle , especially for the weakly gravitational background @xcite .",
    "since the entanglement between different spacetime positions can be extracted @xcite , our analysis on the accelerated systems in minkowski spacetime could be easily extended to curved background @xcite , where the quantum - memory - assisted eur is believed playing a fundamental role .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate the implication of our results in quantum gravity theory @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the nonlocality , along with uncertainty , characterizing the difference between classical and quantum physics .",
    "as the strength of quantum correlations might be radically altered in relativistic framework , it was shown that @xcite the nonlocality of system in terms of the violation of the chsh inequality should also inherit the observer - dependence feature , while the rigidity of the tsirelson bound is guaranteed by the so - called information causality @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the nonlocality is inextricably and quantitatively linked to uncertainty @xcite and can be determined uniquely by it .",
    "consequently , the entropic uncertainty bound derived in ( [ lhs1 ] ) ( [ cavityu ] ) could determine the nonlocality of the system @xcite .",
    "generalized to a dynamic spacetime ( e.g. robertson - walker space ) , this link between nonlocality and entropic uncertainty should be particularly powerful in understanding the emergence of classical behavior in quantum system .",
