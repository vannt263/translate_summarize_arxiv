    "usually , resources available for the experiment allow us to perform at most @xmath3 trials , where @xmath3 is a number known in advance .",
    "suppose that all relevant properties of an experimental design depend only on the numbers @xmath4 of trials performed in individual design points @xmath5 .",
    "then , we can represent the experimental design by an @xmath6-dimensional vector @xmath7 of `` design weights '' , with components @xmath8 , @xmath5 . using this notation , the restriction on the experimental size",
    "can be written in the form @xmath9    suppose also that each trial is associated with a known cost @xmath10 depending on the corresponding design point @xmath5 , and the total cost of the experiment can not exceed a given limit @xmath11 . for each @xmath5 , let @xmath12 be the normalized cost .",
    "then , the total cost constraint can be written in the form @xmath13    if the values @xmath14 are the same for all @xmath5 then the design has , effectively , only a single constraint . however , and may be both relevant if the costs of trials are unequal , which often occurs in practice .",
    "for instance , in an application described in @xcite , the design space @xmath1 represents time , and the cost of conducting a trial is a non - constant function of the time when the observation is sampled . in @xcite ,",
    "the design space is the set of all combinations of factor levels , some of which are significantly more expensive than others .    in some situations ,",
    "the interpretation of the coefficients @xmath14 may be different from direct financial costs .",
    "for example , assume that each trial in @xmath5 consumes @xmath14 volume units of a specific substrate , as in @xcite .",
    "then , the restriction on the total available volume of the substrate can be captured by an inequality of the form .",
    "yet another example of constraints of the type can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where the design space corresponds to treatment doses and the costs represent penalties for doses with low efficacy and high toxicity .",
    "see @xcite for further applications of experimental design under constraints .    in this paper , we will follow an approximate design theory , that is , we will assume that the weights @xmath15 , @xmath5 , are not restricted to the discrete set @xmath16 , but can achieve general real values in the interval @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "this `` relaxation '' of weights leads to a convex problem of optimal experimental design ( the so - called approximate design problem ) , which is significantly simpler than its discrete version ( the so - called exact design problem ) . for details , see the monographs @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to propose a method of constructing a @xmath18-optimal design @xmath19 in the set of all approximate designs that satisfy both the size and the cost constraints and , that is , @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the componentwise comparison and @xmath22 is the @xmath6-dimensional zero vector . in , the function @xmath23 is the criterion of @xmath18-optimality defined by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the standardized information matrix of the size @xmath26 . for simplicity",

    "it is possible to show that the criterion of @xmath18-optimality is continuous , concave , and homogeneous on @xmath31 , see , e.g. , chapter 5 and section 6.2 in @xcite . in particular",
    ", the homogeneity of @xmath32 means that @xmath33 for any @xmath34 and any @xmath35 . due to the homogeneity of @xmath32 , a statistically natural definition of efficiency of a design @xmath36 relative to a design @xmath37 with @xmath38",
    "is given by @xmath39 , cf .",
    "section 5.15 .  in @xcite .",
    "moreover , criterion of @xmath18-optimality is monotonic in the sense @xmath40 for any pair @xmath36 , @xmath37 of designs satisfying @xmath41 .",
    "note that for problem the set of feasible designs is non - empty and compact , therefore the continuity of @xmath32 implies that has at least one optimal solution @xmath19 .",
    "the assumption @xmath42 entails that @xmath43 is non - singular , that is , @xmath44 .",
    "however , for some models the optimal solution of is not unique .",
    "the assumptions of regularity and properties of @xmath32 imply that @xmath45 thus , computing a @xmath18-optimal design under is equivalent to computing a standard @xmath18-optimal design , for which there exist many efficient methods ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for some recent results ) .",
    "similarly , since @xmath46 for all @xmath5 , we have @xmath47 which is a problem that can be transformed to using a suitable change of regressors @xmath30 , @xmath5 ; see , e.g. , section 6 in @xcite or the end of section 10.11 in @xcite .",
    "however , constructing an approximate optimal design under simultaneous size and cost constraints is more complicated , as we discuss next .",

    "however , @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63 is feasible for . at the same time , @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath63 is a convex combination of @xmath19 and @xmath48 , the concavity of @xmath32 guarantees that @xmath65 .",
    "but @xmath63 is feasible for and @xmath19 is optimal for .",
    "consequently , @xmath63 is also optimal for .    using the same reasoning",
    "we can prove that if @xmath53 , then there also exists a @xmath18-optimal design @xmath63 satisfying equalities @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , it is enough to consider the set @xmath66 of designs @xmath34 simultaneously satisfying equalities @xmath67 in other words , once we will be able to find a solution of the `` equality '' size - and - cost constrained problem @xmath68 we will have an exhaustive method of solving the practically usually more meaningful `` inequality '' size - and - cost constrained problem .",
    "if the set @xmath66 of feasible solutions of is not empty , it is a convex and compact polyhedron . at the beginning of section [ sec : theory ] , we add some natural assumptions on the normalized costs @xmath14 , @xmath5 , that guarantee @xmath69 .",
    "then , it is possible to prove a simple `` equivalence theorem '' for the @xmath18-optimal size - and - cost constrained design solving , as well as some other theoretical properties , cf .  section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "analytic solutions of are possible only in the simplest cases ( such as in example [ ex : simple ] at the end of this section ) .",
    "however , there are several general methods of constrained numerical optimization that can be used to develop an efficient algorithm specialized to solve .",
    "first , there is a frank - wolfe - type `` vertex - direction '' algorithm described in section 2.2 of @xcite .",
    "this algorithm assumes that at each step , a separate mathematical programming problem is solved . under and ,",
    "the mathematical programming problem is not difficult , which means that the use of the algorithm would be feasible .",
    "however , it can be expected to be even slower than the vertex - direction algorithms for the standard approximate @xmath18-optimality .",
    "another method , which is proposed in @xcite and generalized in @xcite , is motivated by the analytic technique of lagrange multipliers ( cf .  also @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it can be applied to computing designs under a non - linear constraint . for our specific linearly constraint problem ,",
    "this method is too complicated and rather inefficient , without a proof of convergence .",
    "next , an interesting possibility is to use an algorithm based on the so - called simplicial decomposition , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this algorithm is based on alternately solving a linear programming sub - problem and a non - linear restricted master problem which finds the maximum of the objective function over the convex hull of a usually small set of feasible points . in @xcite ,",
    "the simplicial decomposition algorithm has been used to compute approximate @xmath18-optimal designs under box constraints on weights , where , at each step , the master problem is solved by a generalized unconstrained multiplicative algorithm ( see @xcite , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in a similar way",
    ", the simplicial decomposition could be adapted to solving the size - and - cost constrained problem .",
    "approximate @xmath18-optimal designs under linear constraints can also be computed by modern mathematical programming algorithms , namely maxdet programming ( @xcite ) and semidefinite programming ( sdp ; cf .",
    "these algorithms are very versatile , but their time and memory requirements grow steeply with increasing @xmath6 . using an sdp solver sdpt3 ( @xcite ) for matlab , we were able to solve problems and only for dimensions smaller than @xmath70 ( see section [ sec : examples ] for the specifications of the hardware used ) .    finally , for solving @xmath18-optimal design problems under linear constraints on weights , a promising emerging alternative is a second - order cone programming ( socp ) method developed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the socp methods require very specific software solvers and their actual application for computing optimal designs is technically challenging .",
    "moreover , for the socp methods , the degradation of the performance with increasing @xmath6 is similar to sdp .",
    "therefore , for computing solutions of problem , we decided to construct a specification of the barycentric multiplicative algorithm introduced in @xcite .",
    "the proposed algorithm has favourable properties similar to standard multiplicative algorithms ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for some recent advances in multiplicative methods ) .",
    "more precisely , the barycentric algorithm is very easy to implement and , under mild technical conditions , it has guaranteed monotonic convergence to the optimum .",
    "moreover , the algorithm can be seamlessly combined with stopping rules based on statistical efficiency , as well as with rules for the removal of redundant design points , which yields much more efficient computation .",
    "compared to the vertex direction and the simplicial decomposition methods , the barycentric algorithm does not need to solve a separate optimization problem at each iteration .",
    "in contrast to sdp and socp , the proposed algorithm has very small memory requirements and can be applied to a large dimension @xmath6 of the vector of weights .",
    "naturally , from the point of view of applications , the most important is to find an _ exact _ experimental design with weights restricted to the set @xmath16 , i.e. , such that the numbers @xmath71 are integer .",
    "an efficient solution of the exact @xmath18-optimal design problem under and can often be obtained using the corresponding approximate @xmath18-optimal design , especially if @xmath3 is large .",
    "the simplest method is to `` round down '' an approximate @xmath18-optimal design @xmath19 by replacing the values @xmath72 with @xmath73 for all @xmath5 , where @xmath74 is the floor function .",
    "a more efficient solution can be obtained by using an excursion heuristic such as the one proposed in @xcite , with the result of the simple rounding taken as an initial feasible solution .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to use the heuristic method from @xcite based on integer quadratic programming , which utilizes the information matrix of the approximate @xmath18-optimal design . another possibility is to use the solution of the approximate problem to identify a small subset of @xmath1 that is likely to support the exact @xmath18-optimal constrained design , and then apply the mixed integer socp method described in @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "theory ] , we provide selected theoretical results about the optimization problem , including the so - called equivalence theorem and the rules for the removal of redundant design points .",
    "section [ sec : algorithm ] describes the multiplicative barycentric algorithm for computing solutions of .",
    "section [ sec : examples ] gives a more complex example of a @xmath18-optimal size - and - cost constrained design and provides a small numerical study exploring the behaviour of the proposed barycentric algorithm . in section [ sec : notes ] , we provide miscellaneous short remarks related to the constrained optimal design problems and .",
    "we deferred technical proofs into section [ sec : appendix ] .    before proceeding",
    ", we give a small example to illustrate some aspects of problems and , in particular the fact that for the equality - constrained @xmath18-optimal design problem the values @xmath75 play special roles .",
    "[ ex : simple ] assume that @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "in this elementary model , it is simple to verify that for a design @xmath79 the criterion of @xmath18-optimality is proportional to @xmath80 , and the solutions of both and can be calculated analytically : the solution of is @xmath81 and the solution of is @xmath82    0.4   corresponding to the @xmath18-optimal designs with @xmath76 design points , regressors @xmath77 , @xmath78 and the costs @xmath83 varying in @xmath84.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.4   corresponding to the @xmath18-optimal designs with @xmath76 design points , regressors @xmath77 , @xmath78 and the costs @xmath83 varying in @xmath84.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure [ fig : c1c2 ] , we plotted the values of the @xmath18-criterion in the constrained @xmath18-optimal designs , as they depend on the costs @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for the inequality - constrained problem illustrated in figure [ fig : ineq ] ,",
    "the optimal criterial values are continuous and non - decreasing for decreasing costs , as expected .",
    "however , the optimal criterial values of the equality - constrained problem behave differently .",
    "first , in figure [ fig : eq ] , the domain of the function is restricted to @xmath87 because for couples @xmath88 there is no feasible solution of or the optimal information matrix is singular .",
    "moreover , observe that it is not possible to continuously extend the function in figure [ fig : eq ] to the point @xmath89 , although for @xmath90 the optimization problem is meaningful with a unique solution .",
    "this phenomenon suggests that the points @xmath5 such that @xmath75 play a special role .",
    "furthermore , note that in figure [ fig : eq ] the optimal criterial value can strictly decrease with decreasing costs .",
    "if @xmath91 for all @xmath5 , i.e. , if the costs of all trials are `` low '' , then every design satisfying the size constraint satisfies also the cost constraint , that is , an optimal solution of can be found as a solution of .",
    "analogously , if @xmath92 for all @xmath5 , that is , if the costs of all trials are `` high '' , then every design satisfying the cost constraint satisfies also the size constraint , that is , an optimal solution of can be found as a solution of .",

    "let @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and let @xmath100 be the sizes of these sets .",
    "clearly , our assumptions mean that @xmath101 as well as @xmath102 . for simplicity , in sections [ sec : theory ] and [ sec : algorithm ] we will assume that @xmath103 ; all results can be modified in a straightforward way for @xmath104 .",
