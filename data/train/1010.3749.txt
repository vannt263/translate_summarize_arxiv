    "data of interest for us obtained in pb - pb collisions by na49 collaboration at sps and in au - au collisions by star collaboration at rhic are summarized in table [ tab : table1 ] . using these results we obtained the generalized ratios of @xmath15 ( see eq.([eq:1 ] ) ) , @xmath16 ( see eq.([eq:5 ] ) ) and @xmath17 ( see eq.([eq:8 ] ) ) shown in figure  [ fig : ratios ] .",
    "we note that the ratio of @xmath15 is practically constant for all systems studied with center of mass energies varying from @xmath18 to @xmath1 gev and number of participants ranging from @xmath19 ( most peripheral collisions ) to @xmath20 ( most central ) .",
    "we are in particular interested in recent data from rhic obtained as a function of centrality at @xmath21 gev .",
    "we performed a centrality dependence study shown in figure  [ fig : fit ] .",
    "for every particle species the yield can be interpolated by the following form @xmath22 this function is a good empirical approximation of the individual particle yields . from the functional form of eq.([eq:3 ] ) seen in figure  [ fig : fit ] , one can see that the individual @xmath2 and @xmath4 yields change by a factor of ten for au - au collisions at 62 gev studied in the star experiment . when we look at the higher energy at star and the lower energies at na49 , these individual yields vary even more .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath15 ( as defined by eq.([eq:1 ] ) ) remains within the small range of @xmath23 .",
    "within the shm approach particle yields are obtained by evaluating the accessible phase space .",
    "the particle density can be written as , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the chemical freeze - out temperature , @xmath26 is the spin degeneracy factor , @xmath27 is the phase space occupancy , @xmath28 is the fugacity factor based on the quark content of the given hadron species , and @xmath29 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "there are several popular models of statistical hadronization .",
    "they differ by the assumption made about how the quark content of the qgp phase is imaged into the valence quark content of the final hadron state .",
    "to begin , one ( tacitly ) assumes chemical equilibrium of quarks in the quark ",
    "gluon plasma phase .",
    "this equilibrium condition does not have to ( and in fact it is argued in the following that it can not ) become chemical equilibrium of the emerging hadron gas .    to allow for varying degree of chemical equilibration among final state hadrons",
    "one introduces the phase space occupancies @xmath30 and @xmath31 which control the overall number of quark anti - quark pairs of the light and strange quarks respectively .",
    "the fugacity factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 control the relative chemical equilibrium ( i.e. , the relative yields of @xmath34 quarks and their respective anti - quarks ) .",
    "+ ( i ) : in chemical _ equilibrium _ , slow hadronization is assumed . during this phase transition ,",
    "all the flavors of quarks have enough time to re - equilibrate into their respective hadron gas equilibrium @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "( ii ) : _ semi - equilibrium _ model takes into account that lighter quarks could equilibrate faster in hadronization process than strange ones and thus only @xmath38 , while is fixed to @xmath35 .",
    "+ ( iii ) : chemical _ non - equilibrium _ assumes a rapid hadronization so that not even light quarks have enough time to re - equilibrate .",
    "both strange and light quark phase space occupancies are allowed to adopt values different from unity as appropriate to describe the observed particle yields .",
    "note that when using this most general approach , it is possible to deduce the two earlier models as result of data analysis .      to be specific , the directly produced yield of @xmath4 can be expressed as @xmath39    it is important to see how fast this series converges .",
    "it depends not only on the mass to temperature ratio , but also on the phase space occupancies and fugacities as they may be greater than unity and appear in increasing powers in the series . to get a sense for",
    "how fast this sum converges , let us examine the following case ( table  [ tab : table2 ] ) .",
    ".[tab : table2 ] example of parameters used to study particle densities .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     when we calculate the partial contributions to the particle yields of interest , we find as shown in table [ tab : table3 ] , that the heavier the particle is , the faster the sum converges .",
    "we have to be careful with less massive particles , such as pions , and even kaons .",
    "considering the first seven terms for pions gives us only 96% of their yield .",
    "for kaons , we have to take the first two terms to get 99.8% of their yield . however , for particles whose mass @xmath40 , it is sufficient to take the boltzmann approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ , just the first term @xmath41 in eq.([eq:11 ] ) : @xmath42 one has to be even more careful when using expansion of the bessel function in @xmath43 which converges much slower .",

    "therefore , we include in our calculations directly produced @xmath2 s and @xmath4 s and the contributions from decays of heavier resonances .",
    "the most significant contribution comes from @xmath57 with spin degeneracy @xmath58 .",
    "we use the decay tables as implemented in the share program  @xcite .",
    "particle yield ratios are very sensitive to the valence quark content and we can take advantage of this by considering specific ratios .",
    "one uses ratios since when one takes the same number of hadrons in the numerator as in the denominator , the overall normalization is canceled .",
    "we also consider the product of a particle and its antiparticle in order to eliminate the chemical potentials , which are opposite , and therefore the fugacity factors also cancel . finally , by the choice of hadrons involved ,",
    "one can change how the ratio depends on the phase space occupancies .",
    "for these reasons , we look first at the generalized ratio of @xmath2 to @xmath4 , defined as : @xmath59 the ratio of @xmath15 is proportional to the light quark phase space occupancy @xmath30 and a function @xmath60 of temperature @xmath25 , @xmath61 which in the boltzmann approximation is determined by degeneracies @xmath62 and masses of the hadrons contributing to the yields and over which we sum using the boltzmann approximation . as evident from eq.([eq:11 ] ) , the effect of quantum statistics is decreasing with the hadron mass @xmath63 when compared to the freeze - out temperature @xmath25 .",
    "we calculated the magnitude of this effect to be @xmath64 for the @xmath15 ratio and is therefore negligible .",
    "one has to remember that the formula for the residual function eq.([eq:13 ] ) does not account for strong decays in which flavor content is redistributed , nor does reflect any possible weak decays influencing the yields in question .",
    "global fits  @xcite of the systems under consideration show that all these systems hadronize at the same temperature @xmath25 in the non - equilibrium model .",
    "this , together with the observed constant ratio of @xmath15 , implies common hadronization conditions for all the systems studied .",
    "another immediate implication is that the light quark phase space occupancy @xmath30 is constant and has the same value for all the energies , centralities and systems studied .    to obtain the results presented here we actually use the share program @xcite .",
    "we consider several values of the @xmath15 ratio and plot the results in the @xmath30@xmath25 plane in figure [ fig:1 ] . in combination with the global fit results ,",
    "there are two possible regions to look for possible hadronization conditions .",
    "the first region corresponds to light quarks being in chemical equilibrium .",
    "this is represented by @xmath35 , and from figure  [ fig:1 ] , we see temperature @xmath65 mev . to locate the second region ,",
    "we allow for fast hadronization and relax light quark phase space occupancy @xmath66 . when varying the magnitude of @xmath30 , one has to remember that there is a critical value of this parameter for which pions begin to form a bose ",
    "einstein condensate .",
    "this critical value is given by the mass of the lightest , non  strange meson ( @xmath67 ) by : @xmath68 this is shown as an upper limit in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "in conclusion of this analysis , we observe that it is possible for different reaction systems to occupy different values of @xmath25 and @xmath30 along the solid black line in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "however , much more plausible interpretation is that all reaction systems considered hadronize at the same set of @xmath69 .",
    "this result is strongly supported by the global fit of all hadron yields we performed and in which near critical value of @xmath70 is favored .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] then implies temperature @xmath71 mev .      in the previous subsection , we found that the ratio @xmath15 is proportional to light quark phase space occupancy @xmath30 . to study strangeness occupancy @xmath31 we have to identify a ratio proportional to @xmath31 . by the same reasoning as before ,",
    "we are motivated to examine the ratio of @xmath2 to k defined as : @xmath72    it is evident from both table  [ tab : table1 ] and figure  [ fig : ratios ] that @xmath2/k is not constant .",
    "the au - au , @xmath21 gev , rhic data which inspired this study show a systematic variation with a factor of 1.5 difference between central and peripheral collisions .",
    "when we consider the other systems and energies studied , the factor increases to more than two .",
    "we believe this is due entirely to variation in @xmath31 since as we argued that @xmath73 const .",
    "when @xmath31 is allowed to vary , we have to remember , especially in the view of the expected conditions at lhc where @xmath31 could turn out to be large , that there is also a critical value of @xmath31 .",
    "it turns out that it is the @xmath74 meson ( @xmath75 ) which is the first to condensate when @xmath31 increases .",
    "the critical value for @xmath31 is a function of temperature and can be obtained from the condition : @xmath76 the critical value of @xmath31 is not as sensitive to @xmath30 as it is to temperature .",
    "for the two scenarios discussed , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we get the critical value of @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "we have argued in the last section , that the temperature is constant for all the systems , and we have attributed the change in relative yield of @xmath2 and k to the change in @xmath31 .",
    "this implies that the strangeness initially present in the fireball of qgp does not have enough time to re - equilibrate during the hadronization , and the strange phase space in the hadron gas phase can be under- or over - populated . as a consequence ,",
    "we conclude that chemical equilibrium model ( i ) in subsection [ sec : models ] , which assumed both light and strange quarks to be in chemical equilibrium after hadronization , is no longer a viable description of particle yields in heavy - ion collisions .    with the range of @xmath81 and @xmath25 established by measuring @xmath15 and @xmath82",
    ", we can now predict the ratios of particles which are harder to observe experimentally . according to the quark content of the particles in question ,",
    "we establish how their ratio depends on phase space occupancies and with that predict the behavior and possible values of their ratio .    both the ratios @xmath83 and @xmath84 are proportional to @xmath31 . in the top section of figure  [ fig:3 ]",
    "we show fixed values of @xmath83 and the band of experimental data for this ratio in the @xmath85 plane . in the bottom frame of figure  [ fig:3 ]",
    "we show the corresponding @xmath84 ratio and find a narrow range : @xmath86    similarly , with temperature @xmath25 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 constrained to a small range of values , we can predict other ratios of particles , such as @xmath87 or @xmath17 ( see figure [ fig : ratios ] ) defined by @xmath88 which are both very sensitive to the amount of strangeness in the emerging hadron gas due to their dependence on @xmath89 .",
    "one very simple and solid prediction we can make based on the universality of the results for @xmath15 is that @xmath90% at lhc too .",
    "this universal hadronization condition for @xmath69 has been observed so far in both sps and rhic results .",
    "we strongly believe that this yield will be observed in heavy ion reactions at lhc .",
    "we also expect considerably greater absolute yield of @xmath4 at lhc , since one can anticipate that there is a greater strange quark pair density production because of more extreme initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "we found in a kinetic exploration of strangeness production that the strangeness over entropy ratio at lhc is at least @xmath91 .",
    "this implies , as shown in  @xcite , that the ratio of @xmath92 .",
    "we use this value in our further lhc predictions . here",
    "we note that since the size of reaction volume changes , as does baryon and strangeness content , several shm parameters such as @xmath93 are expected to change .",
    "thus the hadronization universality only refers to @xmath69 .",
    "we show the required value of @xmath31 as a function of the measured value of @xmath94 in figure  [ fig:4 ] for both chemical semi- , and non - equilibrium .",
    "also we show ( colored ) bands of data from different experiments and also a prediction for lhc results .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the temperature does not have a great effect on this ratio when we fix @xmath95 , a very fortuitous result  the increase of @xmath4-yield with @xmath25 is nearly compensated by increase in @xmath96-yield .",
    "thus , if at lhc @xmath97 we can be sure that irrespective of the model of hadronization the value of @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath98 can not be build up from a small initial value in hadron based strangeness production since chemical equilibrium is reached at @xmath36 . on the other hand , when the source of hadrons is a strangeness rich initial phase , such as chemically equilibrated quark  gluon plasma , hadronization can lead to phase space overpopulation in final state .",
    "this is true in particular for a fast hadronization process , in which strangeness content does not have time to re - annihilate .",
    "the experimental results from sps and rhic provided an important observation , that the ratio @xmath15 is nearly constant for wide range of energies , centralities and even across different systems , while the individual yields change by more than an order of magnitude . as this ratio is governed by light quark phase space occupancy @xmath30 , and hadronization temperature @xmath25 , than these conditions are very likely universal for all the experiments .",
    "this universality in regard to @xmath69 is strongly supported by global data fits  @xcite .    a different ratio , @xmath83 , which is proportional to strange phase space occupancy @xmath31 , changes by a factor of 2 , which implies that @xmath31 changes significantly between different experiments and centralities .",
    "thus , we learn that the full chemical equilibrium hadronization is not a viable model .",
    "we further find that some experimentally observed yields of multistrange hadrons , such as @xmath4 , are only compatible with @xmath98 .",
    "for this to happen , we require strangeness rich initial phase ( quark  gluon plasma ) and fast hadronization , so that strangeness abundance does not have enough time to re - equilibrate during hadronization .",
    "our study allowed us to predict certain particle ratios for which precise data is not available at present experiments and for the upcoming lhc .",
    "for example , we expect @xmath99 at rhic 62 gev .",
    "we expect the ratio @xmath15 to remain in the same range of values at lhc as it has been measured at sps and rhic , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
