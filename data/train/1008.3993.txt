    "a random laser has two elements : an active material that spontaneously emits light and amplifies it via stimulated emission , and a disordered medium that partially traps light by multiple scattering .",
    "lasing occurs when the loss due to absorption and leakage of light through open boundaries is compensated by light emission and amplification inside the medium .",
    "stronger scattering increases the trap time of light and lowers the leakage loss .",
    "letokhov discussed the diffusion process with gain that can lead to lasing with non - resonant feedback in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "early experiments , e.g. , on dye solutions containing microparticles @xcite , showed a dramatic narrowing of the emission spectrum and a rapid increase of emission intensity at the frequencies around the maximal gain where the threshold condition is met .",
    "in contrast to the smooth and relatively broad lasing spectra , later experiments illustrated multiple sharp peaks of laser emission from semiconductor powder and disordered polymers @xcite .",
    "those spectral peaks result from interference of scattered light in the random media .",
    "although interference is not required for lasing action , it reduces light leakage at certain frequencies @xcite and facilitates lasing by lowering the threshold ( gain = loss ) .",
    "thus lasing occurs at those frequencies , producing emission with high first - order coherence ( narrow spectral width ) and second - order coherence ( suppression of photon number fluctuations in single modes ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the reproducible lasing peaks , stochastic spikes were observed in single - shot emission spectra with pulsed excitation @xcite .",
    "these spikes are completely different in frequency from shot to shot , and are attributed to strong amplification of spontaneously emitted photons along long paths .",
    "the rich phenomena of random lasers have not been well understood so far .",
    "the diffusion model including gain can describe the narrowing of broad emission spectra @xcite , but not the appearance of discrete lasing peaks since it neglects the interference effects .",
    "semiclassical laser theory , based on the maxwell s equations , can predict the lasing peaks @xcite but not the stochastic emission spikes because it does not take into account the spontaneous emission . the spectral width of lasing modes can not be calculated either without spontaneous emission .",
    "we do not know how the laser linewidth compares to the frequency spacing of lasing modes .",
    "if the former is larger than the latter , the lasing peaks are indistinguishable no matter how fine the spectral resolution is .",
    "a diffusive or ballistic system , especially with higher dimensionality , contains a huge number of resonances that overlap spatially and spectrally .",
    "although these resonances have similar lasing thresholds , they can not all lase simultaneously because of gain depletion @xcite . a large fluctuation of lasing spectra have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the lasing modes are sensitive to small perturbations and noise , e.g. , fluctuation of pump pulse energy , spatial variation of pump intensity , etc . @xcite .",
    "in addition to the extrinsic noise , the number of spontaneously emitted photons participating in the buildup of laser emission in any mode may fluctuate from shot to shot , leading to variations of lasing peak height @xcite .",
    "such intrinsic fluctuations are missed by semiclassical laser theory . since random laser thresholds are usually higher than conventional laser thresholds due to weaker optical confinement , stronger pumping is required , making the amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) stronger .",
    "semiclassical laser theory , which neglects ase , can not capture the transition from the amplification of spontaneous emission to lasing oscillation that has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "note that spontaneous emission only contributes to part of the intrinsic noise , which also includes the fluctuations induced by atomic dephasing , pumping , optical leakage , etc .",
    "since intrinsic noise plays an essential role in random lasing behavior , it must be treated properly .",
    "there have been significant advances in theoretical studies on photon statistics of random lasers and amplifiers @xcite .",
    "most of them are based on full quantum treatments of noise in the modal description . for a random system ,",
    "the mode structures are complex and unknown _ a priori_. thus it is desirable to introduce noise without prior knowledge of modes .",
    "some previous studies based on light diffusion and random walks @xcite do not need mode information , but they ignore light interference that is essential to the formation of resonant lasing modes .    in this paper",
    "we incorporate intrinsic noise into the numerical simulation of random lasers .",
    "the numerical method is based on the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) formulation we recently developed to study the effects of noise on light - atom interaction in complex systems without prior knowledge of resonances @xcite .",
    "the interference effects and the openness of the system are fully accounted for with maxwell s equations and absorbing boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of the bloch equations for the density of states of atoms simulate the dynamics of atoms and their interaction with light @xcite . in the many - atom and many - photon limit the quantum fluctuations",
    "can be simulated by classical noise terms @xcite .",
    "based on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , we consider noise associated with three dissipation mechanisms for atoms ( described in detail in @xcite ) ( i ) dephasing events , ( ii ) excited state decay , ( iii ) incoherent pumping ( from ground state to excited state ) .",
    "noise related to field decay is negligible because the photon energy at visible frequencies is much larger than the thermal energy at room temperature . at higher temperatures or longer wavelengths , where this noise becomes significant ,",
    "it can be incorporated into the fdtd algorithm following the approach we developed in @xcite .    here",
    "we study the effects of intrinsic noise on the steady - state properties of random lasers in one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "results from systems of different scattering strengths are presented which probe varying degrees of light leakiness and spectral mode overlap .",
    "for the first time , we are able to simulate the transition from ase to lasing using the stochastic maxwell - bloch equations .",
    "stochastic emission spikes are reproduced with similar statistics to the experimental data reported previously @xcite .",
    "the spectral width of the broad ase peak is calculated as a function of pumping rate .",
    "it displays a dramatic decrease with increasing pump level as seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "the linewidths of individual lasing modes are also computed and compared to the schawlow - townes linewidth of single mode lasers .",
    "a comparison of the results of simulations with noise to the simulations of the same active system without noise illustrates that noise effects are strongest in the transition regime from ase to lasing .",
