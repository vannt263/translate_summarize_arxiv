    "the current model ( see reviews of cheng & lu 2001 and 2002 ) of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows is that a sideways expanding jet ( rhoads 1999 ) drives a blast wave propagating into the circum - burst medium , and the shock - accelerated electrons give rise to the afterglow emission .",
    "the main radiation process is believe to be synchrotron emission by electrons ( e.g. , & rees 1997 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) , which is consistent with the afterglow spectra ( e.g. , galama 1998 ) .",
    "the polarization detections in afterglows have also implicated the synchrotron mechanism ( e.g. , covino 1999 ; wijers 1999 ) .",
    "the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission is also important if the energy density of radiated synchrotron photons exceeds that of the magnetic field in the shock",
    ". this may be always the case since the ratio between the post - shock energies in electrons and in the magnetic field is commonly larger than @xmath0 , and a significant fraction of the shock - heated electron energy is radiated away .",
    "the ssc emission has been studied by previous works based on the spherical afterglow model ( panaitescu & 1998 ; wei & lu 1998 ; totani 1998 ; chiang & dermer 1999 ; dermer , chiang & mitman 2000 ; dermer , bttcher & chiang 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ; sari & esin 2001 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ) .",
    "two cases of x - ray excess in the afterglow spectra have been explained to be the inverse - compton components ( harrison 2001 ; yost 2002 ) .",
    "the observed x - ray emission from grb afterglows usually comes from synchrotron by fast cooling electrons , those electrons with energy - lose times less than the dynamical time of the system .",
    "if these electrons lose energy mainly by ssc rather than synchrotron , more shock - heated electrons would cool rapidly , thus the distribution of electrons and hence the x - ray light curve index would be different from the synchrotron - dominated case ( panaitescue & kumar 2001 ; li , dai & lu 2002 ) . furthermore , the ssc component is possible to be directly detected in the x - rays in some cases .",
    "thus the ssc effects should be taken into account when modelling the afterglow observational data .",
    "panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) had incorporated numerically the ssc mechanism in the modelling of many grb afterglows , in order to give out the physical condition of relativistic jets in grb afterglows .",
    "however , most people still tend to use the simple asymptotic relation of light curve , rather than the numerical modelling , to fit the observational data .",
    "in many cases , though the afterglows are in the ssc - dominated regime , the asymptotic relation in synchrotron - dominated regime are still used in the fitting . therefore it is necessary to derive the parameter range in which the afterglow are ssc - dominated , and then the analytical asymptotic relation of afterglow light curve in this regime .    in this paper , we make more detailed study on the inverse - compton processes in grb afterglows , especially the x - ray afterglow emission from jets in ssc - dominated regimes .",
    "we first introduce in section 2 the whole dynamical evolution of a beaming afterglow . in section 3",
    "we calculate the light curve of synchrotron emission and the model parameter constraint on the ssc - dominated case .",
    "we then discuss in section 4 the case when ssc emission emerges directly in x - rays .",
    "section 5 is a brief summary and discussion .",
    "consider a beaming outflow from the grb source , so called a jet , which decelerates as sweeping up the ambient medium and sideways expanding in the local sound speed .",
    "if the radiation energy is negligible compared to the jet kinetic energy , the jet can be regarded as adiabatic when considering its dynamic evolution .",
    "this is always the case provided the energy fraction that goes into shocked elections is @xmath1 , which is the common value from model fit to observational data . for a higher @xmath2 , the jet will undergo first an early radiative stage , in which the afterglow light curve index is relevant to @xmath2 ( bttcher & dermer 2000 ; li , dai & lu 2002 ) .",
    "we consider only adiabatic dynamics here .",
    "a jet , with equivalent isotropic energy @xmath3 , coasts first with initial lorentz factor @xmath4 until it sweeps up enough material at a deceleration time @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the ambient medium density .",
    "after @xmath7 the jet begins to decelerate .",
    "the deceleration of the jet includes three stages : first , when the sideways expansion is not significant compared to the initial jet open angle @xmath8 , the jet undergoes a spherical - like phase where the jet lorentz factor decreases as @xmath9 ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) , with @xmath10 the observer s time , and the jet open angle is @xmath11 . secondly , when the sideways expansion begins to dominate the dynamical evolution at @xmath12 , we have @xmath13 , and the jet turns into a spreading phase where @xmath14 ( rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "here we have assumed that the sound speed in the relativistic stage is comparable to light speed , @xmath15 .",
    "finally , the jet becomes non - relativistic , @xmath16 , at @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the non - relativistic phase",
    "the sideways expansion is not important to affect the dynamical evolution , and the shock s velocity @xmath19 , its radius @xmath20 .",
    "the three special times are calculated in the following : t_0=90(e_52/n)^1/3_0,2 ^ -8/3 , t_j=4.210 ^ 4(e_52/n)^1/3_0,-1 ^ 8/3 , [ eq : tj ] t_n=4.210 ^ 6(e_52/n)^1/3_0,-1 ^ 2/3 , [ eq : tn ] where we have used the convention @xmath21 and c.g.s units .",
    "hereafter , by  sphere \" we mean the @xmath22 phase , by  jet \" the @xmath23 phase and by  nr \" the @xmath24 phase .",
    "the shock accelerates the ambient electrons to high energies , with electron lorentz factors described by a power - law distribution : @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the typical lorentz factor of electrons is proportional to the internal energy density of the shock as @xmath27 . at the beginning",
    "it is approximated as @xmath28 at @xmath7 , and evolves as @xmath29 in the relativistic regime since @xmath30 , while in the nr phase it becomes @xmath31 since @xmath32 for nr .",
    "the magnetic field is also created by the shock , commonly assumed to carry a fraction @xmath33 of the total internal energy behind the shock front .",
    "thus the energy density of magnetic field , @xmath34 , is also proportional to @xmath35 . at the deceleration time",
    "@xmath7 , the magnetic field is @xmath36 , later on it evolves as @xmath37 in the relativistic regime [ @xmath38 ( sphere ) and @xmath39 ( jet ) ] , while @xmath40 in nr phase .    under these conditions",
    "the synchrotron radiation is produced , with the instantaneous spectrum described as power - law segments ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "the typical frequency of synchrotron photons is relevant to the typical electron energy , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is defined by wijers & galama ( 1999 ) and of order of unity .",
    "the electrons lose energy through both synchrotron and ssc , and the compton parameter @xmath43 , i.e. , the ratio between the inverse - compton to synchrotron luminosity , is calculated as ( sari & esin 2001 ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fraction of electron energy that is radiated away ( by both synchrotron and ssc ) .",
    "the synchrotron cooling frequency , i.e. the frequency of the synchrotron photons radiated by those electrons which cool on the dynamical time of the shock , is given by @xmath46 since the electrons responsible to synchrotron frequencies above @xmath47 lose energy quickly , the radiated fraction of electron energy is therefore @xmath48 the equations ( [ eq : y])-([eq : eta ] ) show that @xmath43 and @xmath47 are correlated , and these three equations should be combined to solve the time evolutions of both @xmath43 and @xmath47 , especially for the ic - dominated case , @xmath49 , which we focus on in this paper .",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath47 should be solved by numerical calculation , while for extreme case @xmath50 we can reach an analytical result ( see also li , dai & lu 2002 ) , @xmath51 }      &    { \\rm nr.}\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    the flux peaks at the lower one of the two frequencies @xmath52 and @xmath47 .",
    "the swept - up electron number is approximated by @xmath53 , and the power per unit time per unit frequency emitted by single electron is ( in the comoving frame ) @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is calculated by wijers & galama ( 1999 ) and is of order of unity .",
    "furthermore , the energy emitted by total electrons is distributed over an area of @xmath56 at a luminosity distance @xmath57 from the source , the observed peak flux density is therefore @xmath58    except for the very early times ( see equation [ eq : tcm ] ) , the afterglow is generally in slow cooling regime with @xmath59 .",
    "we focus on the highest radiation energy range of afterglows , i.e. the x - ray band , which usually corresponds to the @xmath60 flux , @xmath61 }      &    { \\rm      nr.}\\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this above equation expresses the light curve of synchrotron emission in the ic - dominated case ( @xmath49 ) and in the jet spreading phase , but that equation has a mistake in the @xmath49 case . ] .",
    "we summarize the results together with previous works for synchrotron - dominated case ( @xmath62 ) in table [ table ] .",
    "since the synchrotron emission in the @xmath63 range , @xmath64 , is irrelevant to the evolution of @xmath47 , the light curve index in this frequency range is the same as the synchrotron - dominated case .",
    "the scaling relations for synchrotron - dominated case have not been included in table [ table ] and can be found in sari , piran & halpern ( 1999 ) and dai & lu ( 1999 , 2000 ) .      with different values of physical parameters , e.g. , @xmath2 and @xmath33 , the system may correspond to different cases of whether synchrotron- or ic - dominated , therefore we discuss the parameter range now .",
    "in general , the afterglow is initially in the fast cooling regime , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and then the compton parameter is a constant , @xmath67 , provided commonly @xmath68 .",
    "it is not until a time , @xmath69 that the afterglow becomes slow cooling and the compton parameter decreases as @xmath70}$ ] .",
    "for the cooling of electrons to be still dominated by ssc process , the compton parameter at the point of jet break should be larger than unity : @xmath71 .",
    "this , with help of equation ( [ eq : tj ] ) , leads to @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "thus , with the commonly taken parameters , such as @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the afterglow is still compton - dominated when the jet break in the light curve appears .",
    "after the jet break point , the compton parameter turns to drop faster as @xmath78 .",
    "if we require that the @xmath43 value is still larger than unity when the jet goes into nr phase , i.e. , @xmath79 , the condition is @xmath80 for @xmath73 and @xmath81 for @xmath75 .",
    "therefore the compton cooling may dominate synchrotron cooling even in the nr phase for the common parameter values .",
    "so in the whole period of x - ray observation , compton cooling is strong .",
    "these above inequations are insensitive to the initial condition of afterglows , like the total ( isotropic ) energy @xmath3 , the ambient density @xmath6 and the jet open angle @xmath8 , but sensitive to shock physics .",
    "we show the parameter ranges in figure [ fig : range ] .",
    "the ssc component dominates the synchrotron one in high enough energy range , and its spectral shape can also be approximated by broken power laws as synchrotron one ( panaitescu & kumar 2000 ; sari & esin 2001 ) : @xmath82 for @xmath83 ; @xmath84 for @xmath85 ( or @xmath86 for @xmath87 ) ; and @xmath88 for @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 , with @xmath92 being the electron lorentz factor corresponding to synchrotron frequency @xmath93 .    after a time @xmath94 the system becomes slow cooling , with @xmath95 for synchrotron component and @xmath96 for ssc component . if taken @xmath76 and @xmath77 typically , the system is in the ssc - dominated regime .",
    "therefore we here limit our discussion to the ssc - dominated ( @xmath49 ) and slow cooling ( @xmath97 ) case , during which for typical parameters the crossing point between the synchrotron and the ssc spectral components , @xmath98 , generally lies above the synchrotron cooling frequency @xmath47 and below ssc cooling frequency @xmath99 . for the ssc emission to be detected directly in x - rays ,",
    "we need @xmath100  hz . this condition places a lower limit on the ambient density ( sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "we numerically calculate the emission by both synchrotron and ssc and then the evolution of the crossing frequency @xmath98 with time for different ambient densities , as show in figure [ fig : nuic ] . in general , the lower limit is @xmath101  @xmath102 .    in general , the @xmath103 moves into the x - ray band in the jet spreading phase ( @xmath23 ) . for fixed x - ray frequency @xmath104",
    "hz , the crossing time is @xmath105  s. note that we have assumed the slow cooling case which requires @xmath106 . around @xmath107",
    "the observed flux evolves as @xmath108 the spectral slope changes gradually from 1/3 to @xmath109 , which is different from the @xmath110 slope in the high energy tail of synchrotron component , and in the same time the light curve index changes from zero to a steep decline .",
    "the relation between the steep light curve index @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) and the spectral index @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) in the rapid decline is : @xmath115 we emphasize that a steep light curve together with a shallow spectral slope in x - ray band ( e.g. @xmath116 for @xmath75 ) may imply the direct detection of ssc - dominated emission component .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] has shown a case when ssc dominates the x - ray emission in jetted afterglows .",
    "we have discussed in this paper the effect of ssc process on the x - ray afterglow . for a wide range of parameter values ( see figure [ fig : range ] ) , including the commonly taken ones @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the electron cooling is dominated by ic cooling rather than synchrotron one .",
    "this leads to a different evolution of cooling frequency @xmath47 in the synchrotron emission component , and hence a different ( flatter ) synchrotron light curve slope above @xmath47 , say , the x - ray range . the light curve index of jet - spreading phase in ssc - dominated ( @xmath49 ) case is flatter by a factor of @xmath119 than synchrotron - dominated case .",
    "this ssc effect should be taken into account when modelling in detail the x - ray observational data .",
    "it should be noticed that in many case we should use the ssc - dominated @xmath120 relations ( in table [ table ] ) rather than the synchrotron - dominated ones to fit the observation .    for somewhat higher ambient density , @xmath121  @xmath102",
    ", the ssc emission dominates the synchrotron in x - ray range and can be detected directly ( see also sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "the ssc light curve shows a slope of @xmath122 for @xmath123 , quite steeper than the synchrotron one .",
    "when the ssc component emerges , the x - ray spectral slope varies , which may be detected by observation .",
    "the upcoming swift satellite is due to launch at the end of 2003 , which is expected to catch more than 200 afterglows per year . owing to its rapid response",
    ", many afterglows may be rapidly observed in o / uv and x - rays within one minute .",
    "the current operating x - ray satellites , chandra and xmm - newton , have high sensitive and spectral resolution .",
    "so many more detailed x - ray observations of grb afterglows are expected .",
    "we emphasize that the x - ray observation of afterglows may help to follow the cooling of electrons and help to investigate the ssc characteristics of afterglows .",
