    "reconciling the cold dark matter ( cdm ) predictions of supersymmetric models with the stringent constraints from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) has been one of the challenges within the particle physics community in recent years .",
    "the amount of cdm deduced from the wmap data is given by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hubble parameter in units of 100km / s / mpc and @xmath6 the ratio of the matter density of cold dark matter , @xmath7 , over the critical density , @xmath8 , that leads to a flat universe .",
    "this puts severe constraints on the type and parameter space of unified theories with dark matter candidates .",
    "one of the most promising frameworks in this respect is provided by supergravity models that conserve r - parity  @xcite , and thus predict a stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "this particle has to be neutral , and an obvious candidate is the neutralino  @xcite , although gravitinos are also well - motivated @xcite .",
    "if one imposes yukawa unification , as expected from grand unified theories ( guts ) , the solutions become more predictive and additional constraints are imposed on the model parameters @xcite . the same holds for bounds from flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes , which have to be included in the analysis and strongly constrain the allowed supersymmetric parameter space @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above , the neutrino data of the past years provided evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillations and masses , pointing for the first time to physics beyond the standard model @xcite . by",
    "now , it has been established that the atmospheric and solar mixing angles @xmath9 and @xmath10 are large and that the squared mass differences are @xmath11 ev@xmath12 and @xmath13 ev@xmath12 respectively @xcite .",
    "as expected , however , the additional interactions required to generate neutrino masses also affect the energy dependence of the couplings of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and thus modify the yukawa unification predictions .",
    "in fact , a first observation had been that the additional interactions of neutrinos to the tau would spoil bottom - tau unification for small values of @xmath0 @xcite , where we are away from any fixed - point structure while the corrections to the bottom quark mass are small .",
    "subsequently , however , it has been realized that the large lepton mixing could naturally restore unification , and even enable unification for intermediate values of @xmath0 that were previously disfavoured @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the cosmologically favoured area , it is also possible to observe tau flavour violation at the lhc , in the framework of non - minimal supersymmetric grand unification @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we revisit the issues of dark matter and yukawa unification taking into account the effects of massive neutrinos , and large lepton mixing , as indicated by the data . as a first step , we extend previous results to large @xmath0 , finding significant effects on the allowed parameter space and on @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , it turns out that yukawa unification in the presence of neutrinos is also compatible with a positive @xmath1 and large @xmath0 , unlike what happens if the effects of neutrinos are ignored @xcite .",
    "passing to the relic density of neutralinos , we studied the consequences of the above , particularly for the @xmath15 coannihilation region and for resonances in the @xmath16 annihilation channel , finding once more sizeable effects , which are further amplified when large lepton mixing is combined with quantum corrections above the gut scale .",
    "the most straightforward extension of the standard model that can accommodate neutrino masses is to include three very heavy right - handed neutrino states and assume that the smallness of masses arises from the see - saw mechanism @xcite . in this case",
    ", the predictions for @xmath14 and unification clearly get modified .",
    "in particular , radiative corrections from the neutrino yukawa couplings have to be included for renormalization group runs from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ( scale of the heavy right - handed neutrinos ) @xcite .",
    "below @xmath19 , right - handed neutrinos decouple from the spectrum and an effective see - saw mechanism is operative ( with the neutrino mass operator running down to low energies ) .",
    "the relevant equations are given in @xcite and are summarized in the appendix .",
    "in addition , if the gut scale lies significantly below a scale @xmath20 , at which gravitational effects can no longer be neglected , the renormalization of couplings at scales between @xmath20 and @xmath17 may induce additional effects to the running .",
    "the simplest such example is provided within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric su(5 ) gut , and the renormalization group equations ( rges ) in this case are given in @xcite and are also summarized in the appendix .",
    "these runs affect yukawa unification via the supersymmetric corrections to the bottom quark mass ; however , since in the leading - logarithmic approximation the induced modifications to soft masses are proportional to the @xmath21 mixing @xcite , they are significantly suppressed .",
    "nevertheless , it has been realized that the influence of the runs above the gut scale on the dark matter abundance can be very sizeable @xcite , due to changes in the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which is crucial in the coannihilation area . in dark matter calculations",
    ", therefore , the possibility of such effects has to be also analyzed , and compared to the more standard scenarios .",
    "our starting point will be the @xmath24 superpotential at @xmath20 which ( omitting generation indices ) is given by @xmath25 here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the * 10 , 5@xmath28 * and * 1 * @xmath24 superfields , respectively , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the * 5 * and * 5@xmath31 * higgs superfields .",
    "the couplings @xmath32 stand for the up - type quark , down - type quarks / charged lepton and dirac neutrino yukawa matrices .",
    "the symbol @xmath33 stands for _ diagonal _ ( the up- and down - type quark yukawa matrices can not be diagonalized simultaneously ) .",
    "finally , @xmath19 is the right - handed neutrino mass matrix .",
    "in addition , we work with the soft susy - breaking lagrangian @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the * 10 , 5@xmath28 * and * 1 * @xmath24 superfields masses , respectively , and @xmath36 are the * 5 * and * 5@xmath31 * higgs superfields masses .",
    "@xmath37 are the up - type quark , down - type quark / charged lepton and dirac neutrino trilinear terms .",
    "finally , @xmath38 is the @xmath24 gaugino and @xmath39 its soft majorana mass . in the msugra scenario ,",
    "universal boundary conditions are assumed at the gravitational scale @xmath40 @xmath41    the physical values of the masses will then be obtained by integrating the renormalization group equations from @xmath20 down to low energies . in the first part of the runs we work with the rges of su(5 ) from the high energy scale @xmath20 down to @xmath17 .",
    "subsequently , we run the mssm rges , supplemented with right - handed neutrinos , from @xmath17 to the right - handed neutrino scale , @xmath19 . at this scale ,",
    "right - handed neutrinos decouple from the spectrum , leaving us with the mssm rges and the see - saw operator ( which is also renormalized down to the low energy scale ) .",
    "the effects of neutrinos on yukawa unification crucially depend on the magnitude of the dominant neutrino dirac yukawa coupling , @xmath42 , and consequently the magnitude of @xmath19 ( which determines @xmath42 through the see - saw conditions ) .",
    "obviously , for low @xmath19 and @xmath43 , the effects are less significant .",
    "large neutrino yukawa couplings affect unification by increasing the predicted value of @xmath44 .",
    "this can be understood for small @xmath0 by simple , semi - analytic expressions @xcite since only the top and the dirac - type neutrino yukawa couplings ( @xmath45 and @xmath42 ) may be large at the gut scale . in this case , the rges take simple form 16 ^ 2 _ t= ( 6 _ t^2 + _ n^2 - g_u ) _",

    "denoting by @xmath51 the @xmath52 and @xmath53 couplings at the unification scale , it is found that @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 depend only on gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "let us then assume successful @xmath57 unification at @xmath17 , with @xmath58 . in the absence of right - handed neutrinos @xmath59 , thus @xmath60 . in the presence of them , however , @xmath61 at the gut scale implies that @xmath62 ( since @xmath63 ) .",
    "to restore @xmath64 to unity , a deviation from @xmath57 unification would seem to be required . however , large lepton mixing is reconciled with yukawa unification , by making the simple observation that the @xmath57 equality at the gut scale refers to the @xmath65 entries of the charged lepton and down quark mass matrices .",
    "it is then possible to assume mass textures , such that , after the diagonalization at the gut scale , the @xmath66 and @xmath67 entries are no - longer equal @xcite .",
    "the simplest example the one with symmetric mass matrices : @xmath68 here , @xmath69 may be identified with @xmath70 .",
    "while the textures ensure equality of the ( 3,3 ) elements of the down and charged lepton mass matrices , the eigenvalue of the charged lepton mass matrix is not 1 , but @xmath71 , thus implying that @xmath72 after diagonalization . within this framework ,",
    "the issue of yukawa unification in the presence of large lepton mixing has been analyzed in @xcite for small and moderate values of @xmath0 .    in our current work ,",
    "we extend these results to all values of @xmath0 and both signs of @xmath1 , taking appropriately into account the large supersymmetric corrections to @xmath14 @xcite , and using up - to - date experimental bounds .",
    "potentially large lepton mixing effects will be taken into account by imposing the gut condition @xmath73 where @xmath33 is determined by requiring that @xmath44 is in the allowed experimental range .",
    "the third generation dirac neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath42 is determined through the see - saw mechanism by assuming @xmath74  ev and a heavy majorana neutrino scale @xmath75  gev ( a value that ensures that @xmath43 stays within the perturbative regime ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the behaviour associated with the absence of a dirac neutrino coupling should be recovered by appropriately lowering @xmath19 and thus @xmath43 .",
    "the resulting effects to the allowed parameter space for unification are significant , and give interesting information on the magnitude and origin of lepton mixing .",
    "we then proceed to discuss in detail the cosmological implications in the framework of the wmap data .",
    "while gauge unification is considered as one of the most attractive features of supersymmetry , the relations among yukawa couplings derived by embedding @xmath76 in a larger gauge group are less clear .",
    "the charged fermion mass hierarchies indicate that any mass correlations induced by a unified gauge symmetry will be more explicitly manifest in the relation between the yukawa couplings of the third generation , @xmath45 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "how this works depends on the theoretical framework that defines the initial conditions . in @xmath79 , for instance , all fermions are in the same representation , thus , in the simplest realizations , neutrino couplings will be unified with the rest . in @xmath24 ,",
    "the field structure is @xmath80 of @xmath24 and @xmath81 , only implying @xmath57 unification ; neutrinos are singlets and thus there is a freedom of choice ( although the fact that they couple to the same higgs as the up - type quarks could be a motivation for some link with the top coupling ) .",
    "clearly , the more restrictive the unification schemes , the stronger the correlations between quarks and leptons .    in supersymmetric models , unification turns out to be very sensitive to the model parameters . among others",
    ", the compatibility of @xmath57 unification with the observed @xmath52 and @xmath53 masses has a sensitive dependence on the sign of the higgs mixing parameter , @xmath1 , and on the details of the superparticle spectrum  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the universality condition on the soft terms can be removed as in @xcite , resulting in an enhancement of the allowed parameter space .",
    "in fact , it turns out that full third generation yukawa unification @xmath82 in the cmssm fails to accurately predict the experimental values of the third generation fermion masses , unless one goes to a large @xmath0 regime with a heavy spectrum and a dark matter abundance that would tend to overclose the universe .    to correctly obtain pole masses within this framework , the standard model and supersymmetric threshold corrections have to be included",
    "; for the bottom quark , these corrections result to a @xmath83 that can be very large , particularly for large values of @xmath0 . in msugra , in the absence of phases , @xmath83 has the sign of @xmath1 @xcite , which is required in order to obtain a @xmath52-quark mass in the allowed range in models with @xmath57 unification",
    ". however , this also results to a positive supersymmetric contribution to br(@xmath84 ) , which can be compatible with the bounds only for a heavy sparticle spectrum .",
    "the allowed parameter space is nevertheless extremely constrained from the bounds on flavour changing neutral currents , and the new bounds on @xmath85 @xcite are crucial for the whole discussion and comparisons with the sm prediction @xcite . the @xmath86 constraints from brookhaven national laboratory ( bbnl )",
    "@xcite are also relevant since the supersymmetric contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment takes the sign of @xmath1 in msugra  @xcite .",
    "there are also some uncertainties @xmath87(@xmath88 ) in the standard model prediction , due to the hadronic vacuum polarization correction  @xcite . for a heavy sparticle spectrum",
    "the susy contribution to @xmath89 is small with respect to the standard model one .",
    "however , we do not take into account that constraint derived from @xmath90 , since there is no significant deviation from the sm predictions if the hadronic contribution is calculated using @xmath53-decay data ( the current experimental value deviates by 3.4 @xmath91 from the sm prediction if the hadronic vacuum polarization is determined using @xmath92 annihilation data ) .",
    "let us also summarize a few facts on the possible range of the mass of the bottom quark : the 2-@xmath91 range for the @xmath93 bottom running mass , @xmath94 , is from 4.1 - 4.4 gev ( with corresponding pole masses from 4.7 to 5 gev ) .",

    "we study this set for both @xmath106 and @xmath107 , setting @xmath108 .",
    "we also include a reference line without the susy corrections to the bottom mass ( double - dot - dash line , for @xmath109 ) .",
    "the figure exhibits the known fact that in the absence of phases or large trilinear terms , @xmath83 is positive for @xmath1 positive , and therefore the theoretical prediction for the @xmath52 quark pole mass is too high to be reconciled with @xmath57 unification . on the other hand , for @xmath107 , @xmath83 is negative and the theoretical prediction for the @xmath52-quark mass can lie within the experimental range for values of @xmath0 between roughly 30 and 40 ; clearly , for a large @xmath0 it is mandatory to take into account the large supersymmetric corrections to @xmath14  @xcite .",
