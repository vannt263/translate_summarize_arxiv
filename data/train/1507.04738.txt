    "ever since their inception in the 1950s,@xcite frustrated spin systems have been a source of new ideas for a wide variety of problems ; unconventional superconductivity,@xcite order - by - disorder phenomena , @xcite and correlated spin - liquid states,@xcite are among them . in the core of this fertility",
    "is the near degeneracy between a vast number of spin configurations , originating from competing interactions that are favoring mutually exclusive ground states . in frustrated magnetic materials and their models",
    "this massive degeneracy is responsible for an extreme sensitivity to subtle symmetry breaking effects,@xcite strongly amplified role of subleading coupling terms,@xcite hierarchy of emergent energy scales,@xcite and order - by - disorder effects by thermal,@xcite and quantum fluctuations.@xcite    concomitant of the ground - state degeneracy is another hallmark feature of the frustrated spin systems : flat excitation branches at low energies.@xcite they owe their origin to both the topological structure of the underlying lattices that facilitate frustration and the insufficient constraint on the manifold of spin configurations .",
    "a subclass of frustrated magnets that exhibits flat modes prominently is the kagome - lattice antiferromagnets .",

    "[ fig : dm](a ) .",
    "such a pattern is also emblematic of the geometric frustration , manifesting a compromise reached by spins locally to partially satisfy their antiferromagnetic trends .",
    "the following aspect of this picture is crucial .",
    "the non - collinearity of the ordered spin pattern implies strong nonlinear , anharmonic effects.@xcite the role of such effects in the ground - state selection of frustrated systems has been recognized since the early days of the field@xcite and , recently , an accurate , systematic treatments of the quantum order - by - disorder effect due to them has received significant attention.@xcite    -0.5 cm   type of spin ordering on the kagome lattice .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    on the other hand , their role in the excitation spectra of the kagome - lattice antiferromagnets has been hardly touched upon . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate that the nonlinear terms can be particularly important in the spectral properties of the flat - band frustrated magnets , leading to spectacularly strong quantum effects even in the systems that are assumed almost classical .",
    "the resultant spectral features bear a remarkable similarity to the quasiparticle breakdown signatures in quantum spin- and bose - liquids , such as superfluid @xmath5he,@xcite which exhibit characteristic termination points and ranges of energies where single - particle excitations are not well - defined and are dominated instead by broad continua .",
    "it is usually assumed that such drastic effects can only occur in the systems that are inherently quantum in nature.@xcite in our case , their origin is in the near resonance decay of the `` normal '' , i.e. dispersive , modes into pairs of the flat - mode excitations facilitated by the nonlinear couplings . as such",
    ", the effect is strongly amplified by the density of states of the flat modes and is very significant even for large - spin systems that can otherwise appear as purely classical , resulting in the damping effect @xmath6 .",
    "while in the following we give a detailed account of the spectral properties of a specific kagome - lattice antiferromagnet , @xmath1 fe - jarosite , encouraging its further investigation by inelastic neutron scattering , the outlined scenario should be applicable to a wide variety of other flat - band frustrated spin systems.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : h ] we provide a general argument for the resonant - like decay to exist in the frustrated flat - band systems and lay out a qualitative expectation , which highlights an unusual phenomenon : decays remain significant even in the @xmath7 limit . in section",
    "[ sec : fej ] we provide our results for the decay - dominated spectral features in fe - jarosite .",
    "section  [ sec : summ ] gives a brief summary .",
    "technical details are delegated to appendix  [ app0 ] .",
    "because of the noncollinear structure of the ground - state spin configuration , the interacting spin excitations in the kagome - lattice antiferromagnets are described by @xmath8 where the first term accounts for the spin - wave energies while the second is an outcome of the anharmonic coupling of spins that results in the mutual transitions between excitation branches , see appendix  [ app0 ] for details .",
    "specifically , it couples dispersive excitations with the flat modes , allowing for the resonance - like decay of the former into the pairs of the latter . we note that this general form of bosonic hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) occurs in a variety of contexts , including other frustrated antiferromagnets with noncollinear order,@xcite as well as spin - liquids,@xcite valence - bond solids,@xcite and bose - liquids.@xcite    the full extend of the the @xmath9-expansion also involves quartic and source cubic terms ,",
    "see refs .  .",
    "then , the magnon green s function for the branch @xmath10 is @xmath11 in which the self - energy @xmath12 includes all such terms .",
    "however , it is only decay terms in ( [ heff ] ) that are responsible for the resonance - like decay phenomenon discussed in this work . given the off - resonance character of the source term , the hartree - fock nature of the quartic terms , and the large-@xmath13 limit of the problem , one can safely approximate the self - energy by its on - shell imaginary part , i.e. by @xmath14 .",
    "the decay rate @xmath15 in the lowest - order approximation is given by @xmath16 where sum is over the branches of the decay products and an explicit form of the vertex @xmath17 is given in appendix  [ app0 ] .",
    "with that , evaluation of the spectral function @xmath18 is also straightforward .",
    "the anharmonic cubic terms appear in the hamiltonians of the noncollinear magnets via bosonization of the terms that have a form @xmath19 in the local reference frame of the ordered moments.@xcite because of that , cubic vertices in ( [ gamma ] ) necessarily scale with the spin value as @xmath20 .",
    "since the energies of the decay products scale as @xmath21 , it follows that @xmath15 in ( [ gamma ] ) must be spin - independent .",
    "contributions to the decay rate from the higher - order terms should then follow a natural @xmath9 expansion with the exception of some special contours in @xmath22-space where a @xmath23 enhancement in ( [ gamma ] ) is produced due to van hove singularities of the two - magnon continuum.@xcite therefore , one can conclude that for magnets with @xmath24 , damping of higher - energy magnetic excitations due to decays into lower - energy ones must be small compared to the excitation energy .",
    "in other words , generally , @xmath25 and thus one expects that effects of decays can be significant only for low-@xmath13 , quantum magnets.@xcite    here we offer a general scenario in which this seemingly invincible logic fails dramatically . if both decay products belong to the flat modes with constant energy @xmath26 , a remarkably stronger effect must be taking place .",
    "namely , in this case the self - energy of the dispersive modes exhibits an essential singularity at the energy @xmath27 , and , formally , the linewidth @xmath15 in ( [ gamma ] ) is infinite at this energy , the effect we refer to as the resonance - like decay .",
    "in reality , quantum fluctuations of the same origin , i.e. coming from the anharmonic cubic terms , also generate effective further - neighbor @xmath28 spin couplings , @xcite which necessarily warp the flat mode and thus provide natural means of regularizing this essential singularity . however , the resultant fluctuation - induced bandwidth of the flat mode is now @xmath13-independent , @xmath29 , so that the regularized resonance - like broadening in the vicinity of @xmath27 must scale together with the excitation energy : @xmath30 .",
    "this qualitative consideration implies a spectacular quantum effect : a very strong damping , eliminating spectral weight from the respective energy range even in large-@xmath13 magnets .",
    "thus , frustration provides necessary and sufficient ingredients for the proliferation of intrinsically quantum phenomenon of decays into inherently classical spin systems .",
    "altogether , we predict that anomalous broadening and a wipe - out of the spectral weight , associated with the resonant - like decays , should be common in the spectra of the flat - band frustrated systems . in practice",
    ", we argue that the quasiparticle breakdown with characteristic termination points and ranges of energies dominated by broad continua must be present in @xmath31 kagome - lattice fe - jarosite .",
    "in realistic kagome - lattice antiferromagnets , the degeneracy within the manifold of classical @xmath2 states is , most commonly , lifted by the symmetry - breaking dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) terms , @xcite yielding the hamiltonian that closely describes fe - jarosite @xcite and other systems @xcite @xmath32 where summation is over the nearest - neighbor bonds and @xmath33 on the up / down triangles with the order of the site indices in ( [ hdm ] ) shown in fig .",

    "the out - of - plane dm interaction lifts the degeneracy and selects the @xmath34 ground state , i.e. a `` ferro''-120@xmath35 pattern , fig .  [ fig : dm](a ) .",
    "a small in - plane dm term@xcite is neglected for simplicity .",
    "given the large spin value , @xmath31 , we estimate that the ordered moment should be nearly 90% of its classical value.@xcite similarly , the results of the earlier neutron scattering in fe - jarosite@xcite have been interpreted as fully describable by the linear spin - wave theory,@xcite a construction whose validity we question next .    our fig .",
    "[ fig : wk_j2](a ) shows the linear spin - wave theory fits of the neutron - scattering data @xcite using model ( [ hdm ] ) where three distinct excitations branches are easy to identify .",
    "the dm anisotropy shifts the flat mode from zero energy to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , see appendix  [ app0 ] .",
    "the flat mode is also not entirely flat .",
    "this was interpreted @xcite as a sign of a phenomenological next - nearest - neighbor superexchange @xmath28 , ignoring its possible quantum origin .",
    "@xcite since in the following we do not attempt a fully self - consistent calculation , the same interpretation suffices , with an explicit expression for the dispersive flat mode given in appendix  [ app0 ] .",
    "aside from this slight dichotomy with the origin of the flat - mode dispersion , the linear spin - wave theory seems to provide a spectacular account of the data without the need of any quantum effects .    however , we point out that the spectral weight is conspicuously missing from experimental data in the range of energies @xmath38mev in fig .  [",
    "fig : wk_j2](a ) , i.e. no signal has been detected there . while this feature has not been emphasized in ref .   and",
    "one may argue that the collected experimental data points were simply too sparse , the missing band is strongly implied by our discussion , as it is exactly in the range of twice the energy of the flat mode , @xmath39 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : wk_j2](a ) .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : wk_j2](b ) we present the results of the on - shell calculation of @xmath40 for the gapless dispersive mode using ( [ gamma ] ) with the flat - mode dispersion induced by @xmath28 for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : wk_j2](a ) , see appendix  [ app0 ] for details .",
    "as we discuss later , the dynamical structure factor allows to view modes selectively in different parts of the @xmath22-space and in different polarizations.@xcite the results for the damping are combined with the energy @xmath41 of the mode with the shaded area representing half - width boundaries of a lorentzian peak , @xmath42 .",
    "we have also verified @xcite that the effect of renormalization on the real part of the spectrum is minor , in agreement with approximation in ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "our fig .",
    "[ fig : wk_j2](b ) demonstrates that the spin - wave excitation is well - defined until a sharp threshold at about @xmath43 . above that energy ,",
    "the broadening reaches about one third of the bandwidth signifying an overdamped spectrum , consistent with the missing spectral weight in the experimental data .",
    "the sharp transition implies a threshold singularity and other spectral features that are characteristic to the quasiparticle breakdown phenomenon in quantum bose liquids and @xmath44 spin - liquids .",
    "@xcite there is a partial reconstruction of the spectrum at the energies above @xmath45 where decays are no more resonant - like as indicated in the figure , i.e. , occurring due to other , non - resonant channels , but still providing a sizable broadening to the spectrum",
    ".    the non - resonant decays result in a typical broadening @xmath46 , in accord with similar results for the triangular - lattice @xcite and other frustrated spin systems .",
    "@xcite by contrast , the broadening in the resonant - decay region in fig .",
    "[ fig : wk_j2](b ) reaches @xmath47 , an effect larger by a factor exceeding @xmath48 for the considered @xmath31 model of fe - jarosite .",
    "this is in a remarkable agreement with our qualitative discussion on the scaling of the resonance - like decay rate with @xmath13 , provided after eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) above .",
    "we note that the broadening on the top of the band in the non - resonant region translates to less than 1mev , below the experimental resolution of ref .",
    "in which all the data were described as resolution - limited .",
    "the current resolution of the neutron - scattering experiments is easily an order of magnitude higher .",
    "we also point out that our consideration is aimed at the strong qualitative features of the spectrum of a representative flat - band frustrated spin system , not on the minor quantitative details .",
    "as such , small discrepancies with some of the data may occur due to , e.g. , neglect of the in - plane dm terms , but should be considered as secondary .      to demonstrate the effect of decays , we performed a calculation of the magnon spectral functions , @xmath49 , quantities directly related to the spin - spin dynamical correlation function via @xmath50 here , the kinematic formfactors @xmath51 allow to `` filter out '' spectral contributions of some of the modes to the in - plane and the out - of plane components of @xmath52 in the portions of the @xmath53-space while highlighting the other ones : a phenomenon akin to the extinction of the bragg peaks in the non - bravias lattices .",
    "@xcite using this feature , we concentrate only on one of the dispersive modes .    a dramatic view on the drastic transformations of the spectrum can be observed in constant - energy cuts of the dynamical structure factor in the range of energies affected by the resonance - like decays . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dos ] , we present intensity maps of such constant - energy cuts for @xmath54 , a close proxy of the dynamical structure factor @xmath52 , for the dispersive magnon mode for the energies ranging from 11.7mev to 20mev .",
    "the upper cut - off of the spectral function is chosen to correspond to the maximal height of the peaks in the non - resonant decay region in fig .",
    "[ fig : wk_j2](b ) and translates into the broadening @xmath55mev for the fe - jarosite values of @xmath13 and @xmath56 , which should be resolvable by the modern neutron - scattering measurements .",
    "the first of the cuts is below the threshold energy @xmath43 and shows a very close accord of the sharp - intensity peaks in @xmath54 with the expectations from the linear , non - interacting spin - wave theory , shown by the dashed lines .",
    "the three subsequent cuts , fig .",
    "[ fig:2dos](c)-(e ) , are from within the resonant - decay band , @xmath57 , where one can observe strong deviation from such expectations , massive redistribution of the spectral weight into different regions of the @xmath53-space , and a multitude of intriguing `` shadow '' features , reflecting van hove singularities in the two - particle density of states of the decay products .",
    "@xcite the last cut , fig .",
    "[ fig:2dos](f ) , is , nominally , above the top of the magnon band and should be expected to show zero intensity everywhere . instead , it is also affected by the spectral weight redistribution and retains some of the features of the other cuts .",
    "altogether , fig .",
    "[ fig : wk_j2](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig:2dos ] offer a comprehensive theoretical insight into the non - trivial features of the dynamical structure factor of a flat - band kagome - lattice antiferromagnet , which originate from the decays of magnetic excitations facilitated by the nonlinear couplings .",
    "to summarize , we have outlined a general scenario for drastic transformations in the spectra of frustrated magnets that feature flat modes and have substantiated it by a consideration of the spin - spin structure factor of the large-@xmath13 kagome - lattice system fe - jarosite .",
    "our study calls for further studies in these systems .",
    "we would also like to comment that recently , the broad features in the spectra of magnetic systems have become a direct sign of fractionalized excitations of prospective spin - liquid phases .",
    "@xcite in this work , we have provided a case study of an excitation spectrum of a strongly frustrated but almost classical and well - ordered kagome - lattice antiferromagnet , for which we have demonstrated extremely strong broadening and even a complete and spectacular wipe - out of a part of its spectrum . here , the broad features are due to flat or weakly dispersive modes , a hallmark feature of a variety of frustrated spin systems , and due to a non - collinearity of spins in the ground state , again an outcome of competing interactions .",
    "thus , this is also a cautionary tale , because the same reasons that may lead to the spin - liquid behavior may also favor strong coupling and decays among quasiparticles .",
