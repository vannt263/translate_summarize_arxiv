    "since the discovery of a ferromagnetic superconductor uge@xmath6 , a family of ferromagnetic systems , urhge and ucoge , has also been found to exhibit superconductivity and they have been extensively studied with special focus on relationship between ferromagnetism and superconductivity  @xcite . in these compounds , 5@xmath7-electrons are responsible both for the magnetism and the superconductivity , in sharp contrast to the previously found ferromagnetic superconductors such as errh@xmath8b@xmath8 and homo@xmath9s@xmath10 where the magnetism and superconductivity have distinct origins  @xcite .    among these uranium compounds , ucoge has the lowest curie temperature @xmath11k and the superconducting transition temperature @xmath12k at ambient pressure  @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetism is suppressed by applying pressure and @xmath13 seems to approach zero at a critical pressure @xmath14gpa . below this critical pressure @xmath15 ,",
    "ferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist in a microspic way  @xcite , while the superconductivity alone survives up to @xmath16 .",
    "the experimental pressure - temperature phase diagram of ucoge could be understood from theoretical model calculations where ising spin fluctuations mediate superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "indeed , as revealed by the nmr experiments , spin fluctuations in ucoge have strong ising anisotropy and the superconductivity is closely correlated with them especially under magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the experiments show that the @xmath17-axis upper critical field is huge @xmath18 t in spite of the low transition temperature @xmath19k while @xmath4 for @xmath20-axis is merely less than 1 t , which leads to cusp - like field angle dependence of @xmath4 in the @xmath21-plane . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the anomalous behaviors of the observed @xmath21-plane upper critical fields of the superconductivity can be well understood by taking into account the experimental fact that the ising spin fluctuations are tuned by a @xmath20-axis component of the magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the successful agreement between the experiments and theories provides strong evidence for a scenario that the pseudo - spin triplet superconductivity is indeed mediated by the ising ferromagnetic spin fluctuations in ucoge .    on the other hand ,",
    "different characteristic behaviors have been experimentally observed for @xmath3-axis magnetic fields in ucoge  @xcite . in the normal ( non - superconducting ) states ,",
    "the curie temperature @xmath13 is suppressed by @xmath22-axis and it seems to become zero around @xmath23 t , although it is unchanged for @xmath24-axis in the same experiments .",
    "the reduction of @xmath13 by @xmath22-axis is accompanied by an enhancement of the spin fluctuations .",
    "accordingly , at low temperatures , @xmath4 is _ enhanced _ by the @xmath3-axis magnetic field especially around @xmath25 , resulting in `` s - shaped '' @xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , similar behaviors have also been found in the isomorphic compound urhge , where superconductivity vanishes at a critical @xmath22-axis but it reappears at a high field around which ferromagnetism is suppressed with a tricritical point  @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , based on a scenario of the spin fluctuations - mediated superconductivity , it is rather natural to expect s - shaped @xmath4 or even reentrant superconductivity , once one simply takes into account enhancement of the spin fluctuations by the reduction of @xmath13 .",
    "however , within this theoretical approach which strongly relies on the experimental observations of anisotropic behavior with the application of in - plane magnetic fields , it is unclear why @xmath13 is unchanged and therefore @xmath4 is not enhanced for @xmath17-axis magnetic fields . in order to understand the dependence of @xmath4 on the direction of magnetic field",
    ", we should clarify the origin of in - plane magnetic anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , even if one just admits magnetic anisotropy as an experimental fact , nature of the resulting superconducting state under strong @xmath3-axis magnetic field is far from trivial . for small magnetic fields ,",
    "the superconductivity will coexist with the ferromagnetism as in the zero - field case , and it is robust against the pauli depairing effect under in - plane magnetic fields due to exchange splitting of the fermi surface as pointed out by mineev  @xcite . on the other hand , for larger magnetic fields @xmath26 where the superconductivity survives experimentally , the exchange splitting is small or even vanishing , and therefore the mineev s mechanism protecting the superconductivity from the pauli depairing effect does not work .",
    "the limitation of the mineev s mechanism on the pauli depairing effect should also be recognized for understanding @xmath4 under high pressure where ferromagnetism is suppressed . even in paramagnetic states where",
    "the pauli depairing effects are expected to be important , experiments obtain large in - plane @xmath27 t , which is well above the pauli limiting field estimated from @xmath28k  @xcite .",
    "these values of @xmath4 were obtained without fine - tuning of the magnetic field directions and @xmath4 would be further increased by careful tuning of the field directions , since it sensitively depends on a @xmath20-axis component of the magnetic fields in ucoge  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it is expected that the spin fluctuations are large especially around @xmath29 leading to strong coupling superconductivity and the orbital depairing effect would be less relevant there , while the pauli depairing effect is not suppressed and eventually will break the superconductivity .    in this study , we investigate anisotropy for in - plane critical magnetic fields of paramagnetic transition and superconducting @xmath4 in ucoge .",
    "firstly , we make an analysis focusing on zigzag chain crystal structure which is characteristic in ucoge . within a minimal spin model including effects of the zigzag chain structure , we show that the dyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction arising from the zigzag structure leads to the in - plane anisotropy for critical magnetic fields of paramagnetic transitions , which shows a qualitative agreement with the experiments .",
    "we then examine resulting superconducting @xmath4 phenomenologically considering the suppression of ferromagnetism by application of external fields along @xmath3-axis .",
    "it is shown that superconductivity can survive above @xmath30 where there is no exchange splitting of the fermi surface .",
    "we find that this robustness of superconductivity stems from the @xmath5-vector rotation to reduce magnetic energy cost as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "we also touch on the experimental observations based on our calculations .",
    "in this section , we study the origin of strong dependence of critical magnetic field @xmath30 on the field direction in the @xmath0-plane . as mentioned in the previous section , the curie temperature is decreased by magnetic field along the @xmath3-axis , while it is unchanged by magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath17-axis within the experimental range @xcite .",
    "if the magnetic fields are further increased , @xmath13 will be suppressed for @xmath17-axis magnetic fields as well .",

    "@xmath13 decreases rapidly by applying magnetic field along the @xmath3-axis and eventually becomes zero at a critical field @xmath33 at zero temperature , while it is robust against @xmath17-axis field and the corresponding critical field @xmath32 is much larger than @xmath33 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to understand qualitatively what causes this anisotropy in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "magnetic anisotropy generally arises from spin - orbit interactions , and its details depend on strength of the spin - orbit interactions and crystal structures . in @xmath7-electron compounds",
    ", basic magnetic properties could be well understood once the local electronic configuration has been fixed by e.g. neutron scattering experiments .",
    "for ucoge , the experimentally observed ising magnetic properties may be due to a large weight of @xmath34 states in the single electron state at the u - sites .",
    "although precise determination of a level scheme in 5@xmath7-electron systems with low crystal symmetry such as uge@xmath6 and uco(rh)ge is very difficult , the resistivity in ucoge shows rather conventional heavy fermion behaviors with weak anisotropy in effective mass .",
    "this implies that ucoge is well described by effective pseudo - spin 1/2 quasi - particles corresponding to the observed ising - like magnetism .    here , instead of using local electronic structures ,",
    "we investigate the magnetic anisotropy in ucoge by focusing on its characteristic crystal structure . as seen in fig .",

    "the point group of ucoge is @xmath35 and the zigzag chains do not have local inversion symmetry , although they keep global inversion symmetry .",

    "we have neglected spin - spin interactions of in - plane spin components , since the magnetism of ucoge has strong ising nature as verified by the experiments  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we use a unit where @xmath46 .",
    "this spin model should be considered as a variant of the phenomenological ginzburg - landau theory developed by mineev , where the free energy is written in terms of magnetic degrees of freedom only  @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "we use the above spin model as an effective phenomenological description to capture essential physics behind the complicated experimental results with a special focus on the dm interaction .",
    "although the spin model is oversimplified for discussing quantitative properties of ucoge , it is useful for qualitative discussions as a minimal model . indeed , as will be discussed in the following , the physical mechanism leading to magnetic anisotropy under in - plane magnetic fields revealed within the spin model analysis is applicable also for more realistic models of ucoge .",
    "we also note that , since the land @xmath47-factors have not been determined in ucoge , the parameters @xmath48 should be regarded as a renormalized magnetic fields which include @xmath47-factors .",
    "anisotropy of diagonal components of the @xmath47-factors in @xmath49-directions is expected to be small , @xmath50 , since @xmath51-@xmath31 curves show weak anisotropy between @xmath52 and @xmath53 for small magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "although there may be off - diagonal components of the @xmath47-factor we simply neglected them . if @xmath54 or @xmath55 is large , the ferromagnetic phase transitions are smeared out and become crossover under in - plane magnetic fields . in the present model without such off - diagonal components , there is @xmath56 symmetry for general @xmath57 with the operation @xmath58 $ ] which transforms spins as @xmath59 this symmetry is spontaneously broken in the ferromagnetic phase .    in order to understand the anisotropy of the critical fields @xmath30",

    "we find that the calculated ground state preserves the translational symmetry and the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a uniform ferromagnetic state with @xmath61 to a disordered state with @xmath62 as @xmath63 is increased .",
    "we have confirmed absence of a non - uniform magnetic structure by increasing sizes of assumed sub - lattice structures in the numerical calculations .",
    "this is essentially due to strong ising anisotropy which favor the colinear ferromagnetic structure , and coplanar magnetic states might be stabilized if one appropriately includes inter - chain coupling and the dm interaction is sufficiently large .",

    "all the spins are aligned so that they become parallel to the applied fields .",
    "interestingly , the magnetization is not changed by the dm interaction for @xmath17-axis magnetic fields even at @xmath67 , while it is rapidly suppressed by @xmath3-axis magnetic fields as the dm interaction is increased .",
    "this anisotropic behavior can be understood as a result of a competition between the dm interaction and the applied fields ; the dm interaction can be rewritten as  @xcite @xmath68-(j:{\\rm even}),\\\\ \\tilde{s}^{\\pm}_j&=e^{\\pm i\\pi j/4}(s^c_j\\pm is^a_j).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dm interaction alone describes decoupled two copies of `` xy - chains '' in the @xmath69-basis and it increases quantum fluctuations of spins in the @xmath21-plane .",
    "classically , the dm interaction tends to rotate the spins and it frustrates with the ising interaction .",
    "however , once strong @xmath17-axis magnetic fields are applied , this @xmath21-plane quantum fluctuations are pinned and effects of the dm interactions get suppressed .",
    "therefore , the calculated magnetization is almost independent of the dm interaction , and in particular , the transition point almost does not change . on the other hand , for @xmath3-axis magnetic fields @xmath70 , the dm interaction is not suppressed and the ferromagnetic state is destabilized by the quantum fluctuations , resulting in smaller critical fields @xmath71 .",

    "it is noted that the system is dominated by the dm interaction for large values of @xmath72 . around @xmath77 , there is a first order phase transition between the ising ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase at @xmath65 .",

    "@xmath79-axis , the critical field @xmath71 is suppressed by @xmath72 .",
    "if the dm interaction is sufficiently strong , the ferromagnetism is more fragile against @xmath70 than @xmath78 at zero temperature .",
    "this suggests that , at finite temperature , the curie temperature is quickly suppressed by @xmath70 compared with @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian qualitatively explains the expected phase diagram fig .",

    "indeed , ucoge is an itinerant ferromagnet with strong ising anisotropy as verified in experiments  @xcite . in order to understand the quantitative features of the magnetic anisotropy in ucoge",

    "this issue is left for a future study .",

    ", the aso interaction term tends to fix directions of @xmath5-vectors for spin - triplet superconductivity  @xcite . in ucoge , however , cooper pairing between the nearest neighbor uranium sites along the zigzag chain is expected to be stronger than that between the second nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the former is inter - sublattice pairing , while the latter is intra - sublattice pairing .",
    "this suggests that the aso interaction between the intra - sublattices will affect the sub - dominant gap functions only , while its effects on the dominant inter - sublattice gap functions would be negligible in ucoge .",
    "therefore , we neglect the aso interaction and do not explicitly take the sublattice structure into account in the following calculations , which allows us to replace @xmath91 with a single operator @xmath92",

    "it should be stressed that the aso is less important for determining directions of @xmath5-vector of the pseudo - spin triplet pairing between the nearest neighbor sites , but still relevant to understand the magnetic anisotropy .",

    "<S> it is shown that , by taking into account the dyaloshinskii - moriya interaction arising from the zigzag chain crystal structure of ucoge , we can qualitatively explain the experimentally observed in - plane anisotropy for critical magnetic fields of the paramagnetic transition . because of this strong dependence on the magnetic field direction , upper critical fields of superconductivity , which is mediated by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , also become strongly anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observation of `` s - shaped '' @xmath2-axis is qualitatively explained as a result of enhancement of the spin fluctuations due to decreased curie temperature by the @xmath3-axis magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the s - shaped @xmath4 is accompanied by a rotation of the @xmath5-vector , which would be a key to understand the experiments not only at ambient pressure but also under pressure . </S>"
