    "the near - infrared continuum emission of type 1 agns is considered to be dominated by thermal emission from hot dust surrounding the central engine @xcite .",
    "however , the contribution of the accretion disk to the near - infrared continuum emission is suggested by the standard accretion disk model with large outer radius that predicts the power - law continuum emission of @xmath7 at long wavelengths @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , part of the near - infrared emission would originate in the outer accretion disk , although it is difficult to separate the accretion disk component from the dominant thermal dust component by the simple method of spectral decomposition . in order to clearly separate the accretion disk component ,",
    "techniques using variability @xcite and polarization @xcite were recently proposed and applied to some agns .",
    "ngc4395 is a unique object known as the least luminous seyfert 1 galaxy @xcite , having a bolometric luminosity of only @xmath8 ergs s@xmath9 with broad emission lines in the uv and optical spectra @xcite .",
    "its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from the x - ray to radio wavelengths resembles those of normal type 1 agns rather than those of low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) @xcite .",
    "although a compact radio source is detected , it is a radio - quiet agn @xcite .",
    "the mass of the central black hole measured by reverberation - mapping observation of the c iv emission line is as small as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ngc4395 nucleus shows extreme variability at many wavelengths , probably because of its low luminosity and small black hole mass .",
    "fast and large - amplitude variations were observed in the x - ray @xcite , and intraday variations were observed in the uv and optical @xcite . in the near - infrared , while @xcite reported a 15% flux variation in the @xmath3 band at an interval of three weeks , no detailed intraday monitoring observation has been carried out yet .    in this paper , we report the results of the optical and near - infrared intraday monitoring observation of the seyfert 1 nucleus in ngc4395 .",
    "as observed in the x - ray , uv and optical , we found the intraday variation in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands almost synchronized with the optical intraday variation .",
    "we conclude that the emission of the intraday - variable component in the optical and near - infrared originates in the central accretion disk . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt 4.0 mpc for the distance of ngc4395 @xcite .",
    "a one - night monitoring observation was carried out on 2004/05/01 ( utc ) , while our regular program of long - term monitoring observation started from 2004/02/12 ( utc ) , using the multicolor imaging photometer ( mip ) mounted on the 2 m telescope of the multicolor active galactic nuclei monitoring ( magnum ) project at the haleakala observatories in hawaii @xcite . here",
    ", we describe the procedures of observation and data reduction only briefly , because most of them have been described in @xcite .",
    "our one - night monitoring observation started at 06:31 and ended at 12:35 on 2004/05/01 ( utc ) . using the mip s simultaneous optical and near - infrared imaging capability ,",
    "a sequence of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 imagings was repeated cyclically during the observation , and 59 data points for @xmath0 and 20 data points for each of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 were obtained .",
    "the average monitoring interval was six minutes for @xmath0 and 18 minutes for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , the long - term monitoring observation started from 2004/02/12 ( utc ) and 11 data points were obtained until 2005/01/22 ( utc ) .",
    "after 2004/04/29 ( utc ) , the observation each night was carried out quasi - simultaneously ( within 10 minutes ) in the @xmath14 , @xmath0 , @xmath15 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 bands .    the nuclear flux was measured relative to a nearby reference star ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( j2000 ) ) , which was observed along with the target , within the field of view of the mip .",
    "the optical fluxes of the star were calibrated with respect to a photometric standard star in @xcite , and the near - infrared fluxes were taken from the 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources @xcite .",
    "the diameter of photometric aperture was 2.8 arcsec for the optical , and 2.4 arcsec for the near - infrared .",
    "the flux of the host galaxy within the aperture was not subtracted .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the optical and near - infrared light curves of the ngc4395 nucleus on 2004/05/01 ( utc ) .",
    "galactic extinction was corrected for according to @xcite .",
    "clear flux variations in the @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 bands are found during the monitoring period of six hours , and this is the first detection of intraday variation in the near - infrared for normal seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the amplitude of variations was @xmath18 mag , however , the real amplitude for the ngc4395 nucleus must be larger , because non - variable fluxes such as the host galaxy flux and the narrow - line flux were not subtracted from the data .",
    "on the other hand , intraday variation is not clearly seen in the @xmath4 band .",
    "apparently , the intraday variations in the @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 bands are almost synchronized . in order to estimate a possible lag between the optical and near - infrared intraday variations , we applied a cross - correlation analysis .",
    "first , in order to increase the number of data points , the @xmath2-band and the @xmath3-band light curves were combined according to the linear regressions of the @xmath2- and @xmath3-band fluxes to the @xmath0-band flux obtained simultaneously during the one - night monitoring observation",
    ". then a cross - correlation function ( ccf ) was computed based on the linear interpolation method @xcite .",
    "since the number of @xmath0-band data points is larger and their photometric accuracy is better , the @xmath0-band light curve was interpolated .",
    "the lag of the ccf centroid @xmath19 was adopted to represent the lag between two light curves .",
    "the error of @xmath19 was estimated by a model - independent monte carlo simulation called the `` flux randomization / random subset selection '' ( fr / rss ) method @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlation centroid distribution ( cccd ) was made based on the simulation of 10000 realizations .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the ccf and the cccd between the @xmath0-band and the combined near - infrared light curves on 2004/05/01 ( utc ) .",
    "the near - infrared lag time behind @xmath0 is estimated from the cccd as @xmath20 days , or @xmath21 minutes .",
    "the intraday variations in the near - infrared ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) are almost synchronized with that in the optical within an accuracy of @xmath22 minutes .",
    "the short time scale of variation ( a few hours ) and the synchronization to the optical variation ( @xmath22 minutes ) suggest that the intraday - variable component of flux in the near - infrared originates in the central accretion disk .",
    "that is , it is an extension of optical power - law continuum emission to near - infrared wavelength .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the optical and near - infrared light curves of the long - term monitoring observation of the ngc4395 nucleus .",
    "the optical and near - infrared fluxes are clearly variable on time scales of days to months , and the apparent amplitude of variation during the monitoring period reaches about a few tenths to one magnitude .",
    "the optical flux variations in the @xmath14 , @xmath0 , and @xmath15 bands are synchronized with each other , while the near - infrared flux variations , especially in the @xmath4 band , are not completely synchronized with those in the optical .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the flux - flux diagrams from the long - term monitoring observation .",
    "the variations in the @xmath14 or @xmath15 bands relative to the @xmath0 band are almost on straight lines , which suggests that the spectral shape of variable components in the optical region stays constant as reported for seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "the slope of these lines , or the flux variation gradient ( fvg ) , corresponds to the power - law index of variable component . from the regression analysis using the @xmath14 , @xmath0 , and @xmath15 data points of the quasi - simultaneous observation",
    ", we obtain @xmath23 for @xmath14 to @xmath0 , and @xmath24 for @xmath0 to @xmath15 , which are similar to those of more luminous seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the near - infrared @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 variations largely deviate from straight lines , and the deviation is larger for longer wavelengths , which suggests that another variable component exists in the near - infrared .",
    "we extracted the sed of this component by evaluating the near - infrared flux difference at two epochs for which the optical fluxes were almost the same .",
    "the flux difference between 2004/04/29 and 2004/07/21 is @xmath25 ( mjy ) @xmath26 @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 , @xmath32 @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xmath35 , and @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "the color temperature assuming the black body radiation is estimated as @xmath38 k from @xmath39 , and @xmath40 k from @xmath41 .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the near - infrared seds of qsos originating in the hot dust tori @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared intraday variation of the ngc4395 nucleus and its synchronization to the optical suggest that there exists a near - infrared emitting region in the accretion disk , so that the lag between the optical and the near - infrared intraday variations would be a direct measure of the extent of the accretion disk , if the reprocessing of incident flux variation to the near - infrared can be applied .",
    "accordingly , a wavelength - dependent lag in variations of power - law continuum emission is expected , interpreted in terms of light - travel time from the central energy source to each radius of the accretion disk @xcite .    therefore , the outer radius of the accretion disk indicated by the possible lag between the @xmath0-band and the near - infrared intraday variations is worthwhile comparing with the size of the broad emission - line region ( blr ) .",
    "our measurement of near - infrared lag time behind @xmath0 is @xmath42 days ( 2004/05/01 ) .",
    "@xcite reported from the reverberation mapping program for the c iv emission line of the ngc4395 nucleus that the c iv lag time behind uv continuum @xmath43 @xmath44 is @xmath45 days ( 2004/04/10 ) and @xmath46 days ( 2004/07/03 ) .",
    "apparently , @xmath47 is smaller than @xmath48 . if we adopt the wavelength - dependent relation @xmath49 given by @xcite , the near - infrared lag behind the uv continuum would be @xmath50 times larger than that behind @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the inner region of the blr of the ngc4395 nucleus would be a few times smaller than the c iv emitting region because the blr of seyfert galaxies is stratified @xcite .",
    "these considerations suggest that the outer radius of the accretion disk might be comparable to the inner radius of the blr in the ngc4395 nucleus .",
    "next , we discuss the contribution of the power - law continuum component in the @xmath4 band . as described in the previous section , thermal emission from the dust torus largely contributes to the @xmath4-band flux of the ngc4395 nucleus .",
    "since the dust torus is expected to be extended , the short time scale variation of incident flux is smeared out and the thermal flux would not be variable on such a time scale .",
    "then , even if there was an intraday flux variation of the power - law continuum component in the @xmath4 band , it would be veiled by the large amount of thermal flux from the dust torus .",
    "we estimated an average of @xmath4-band fluxes at peaks ( five data points ) and at valleys ( six data points ) of the @xmath0-band intraday variation , and derived their difference .",
    "the @xmath51 upper limit of the flux difference of @xmath52 mjy represents an amount of intraday variation in the @xmath4 band . on the other hand ,",
    "such a difference in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands is about 0.03 mjy .",
    "therefore , it is possible to consider that an intraday flux variation in the @xmath4 band is comparable to those in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands .    finally , we estimate the inner radius of the dust torus according to the correlation between the @xmath0-band absolute magnitude and the lag time of @xmath4-band flux variation reported by @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy flux within the aperture is estimated as @xmath53 mjy from the @xmath15-band magnitude of the central star cluster in ngc4395 @xcite and by assuming typical @xmath54 color of scd galaxies @xcite .",
    "the flux of the [ o iii ] narrow line was taken from @xcite , and its contamination of the @xmath0-band flux is estimated as @xmath55 mjy . after subtracting these fluxes , the @xmath0-band absolute magnitude of the ngc4395 nucleus",
    "is estimated as @xmath56 mag , which leads to a lag time of @xmath57 day .",
    "the thermal flux from such a dust torus , whose inner radius is @xmath58 light - day , would not be variable on a time scale of hours , veiling the possible intraday variation of the power - law continuum component in the @xmath4 band .",
    "the present paper indicates that more intense multi - wavelength monitoring observation of the ngc4395 nucleus every 10 minutes a night will definitely extract the synchronized intraday variation of power - law continuum component up to the near - infrared @xmath4 band , and a wavelength - dependent lag behind x - ray or uv is able to probe the radial structure of central accretion disk . this intense multi - wavelength monitoring observation over a month",
    "will alternatively extract the near - infrared @xmath4 variation of thermal dust component , and its lag behind uv or optical gives an accurate measure of the inner radius of minimum dust torus in the least luminous nucleus among seyfert 1 agns .",
    "these lag measurements of greater accuracy , together with the c iv lag @xcite , will finally uncover a full range of radial structure consisting of the accretion disk , the blr , and the dust torus in the ngc4395 nucleus .    we thank staff at the haleakala observatories for their help with facility maintenance . this research has been supported partly by the grant - in - aid of scientific research ( 10041110 , 10304014 , 11740120 , 12640233 , 14047206 , 14253001 , 14540223 , 16740106 ) and coe research ( 07ce2002 ) of the ministry of education , science , culture and sports of japan .",
