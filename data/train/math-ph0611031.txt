    "we will consider the construction of the absorbing boundary conditions for the schrdinger type equations ( subscripts are used for the derivative with respect to the corresponding variable ) @xmath0 which arise in numerous quantum - mechanical problems and as approximate models for the wave propagation in the parabolic equation method and its generalizations @xcite . for calculating solutions of this equation in unbounded domains",
    "it is essential to introduce boundary conditions at the boundaries of the computational domain which model the free transmission of the waves through these boundaries .",
    "as these boundary conditions must minimize the amplitudes of waves reflected from boundaries , they are called absorbing boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "there is a significant number of works where the problem of constructing of such boundary conditions was considered .",
    "the main approaches in these works consist either in factorization of the differential operator of the equation under consideration into pseudodifferential factors , each of which describes the unidirectional wave propagation @xcite and use the differential approximations of these factors for the formulation of the boundary conditions , or in formulation of the absorbing boundary conditions as the matching condition with the free space solution outside of the computational domain ( for the eq .",

    "as is known , the approximate description of the unidirectional propagation of the waves can be obtained by the generalized multiple - scale method @xcite , which in particular cases gives the same results as the wkb or ray method . in this approach",
    "the algebraic factorization of the hamilton - jacobi equation replaces the factorization of the differential operator . in the simplest case",
    "this approach was reported in @xcite .",

    "this initial condition appears as a result of the representation of initial data @xmath37 in the rapidly oscillating form @xmath38 such a representation is not unique and depends on auxiliary information that is used for recognizing the small parameter @xmath4 , splitting the initial condition into the amplitude and rapidly oscillating parts and determining the way of extrapolation of @xmath39 to all values of @xmath36 and @xmath40 outside the strip ( this is needed to set the cauchy problem for eq .

    "note that if the potential @xmath40 is vanished at the boundaries , the boundary conditions ( [ t8 ] ) degenerate to the dirichlet conditions .    because of that in shibata s paper @xcite was used another linear approximation of the square root , namely the linear interpolation between two points chosen without sufficient physical justification .",
