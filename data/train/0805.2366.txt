    "major advances in our understanding of the universe have historically arisen from dramatic improvements in our ability to  see \" . we have developed progressively larger telescopes over the past century , allowing us to peer further into space , and further back in time . with the development of advanced instrumentation  imaging , spectroscopic , and polarimetric",
    " we have been able to parse radiation detected from distant sources over the full electromagnetic spectrum in increasingly subtle ways .",
    "these data have provided the detailed information needed to construct physical models of planets , stars , galaxies , quasars , and larger structures .    until recently ,",
    "most astronomical investigations have focused on small samples of cosmic sources or individual objects .",
    "this is because our largest telescope facilities typically had rather small fields of view , and those with large fields of view could not detect very faint sources . with all of our existing telescope facilities , we have still surveyed only a minute volume of the observable universe .    over the past two decades , however , advances in technology have made it possible to move beyond the traditional observational paradigm and to undertake large - scale sky surveys . as vividly demonstrated by surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey",

    "2000 ) , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ; martin et al .",
    "2006 ) , to name but a few , sensitive and accurate multi - color surveys over a large fraction of the sky enable an extremely broad range of new scientific investigations .",
    "these projects , based on a synergy of advances in telescope construction , detectors , and above all , information technology , have dramatically impacted nearly all fields of astronomy  and many areas of fundamental physics .",
    "in addition , the recent world - wide attention received by google sky ( scranton et al .",
    "2007 ) demonstrates that the impact of sky surveys extends far beyond fundamental science progress and reaches all of society .    motivated by the evident scientific progress enabled by large sky surveys , three nationally - endorsed reports by the u.s .",
    "national academy of sciences concluded that a dedicated ground - based wide - field imaging telescope with an effective aperture of 68 meters is a high priority for planetary science , astronomy , and physics over the next decade .",
    "the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) described here is such a system .",
    "the lsst will be a large , wide - field ground - based telescope designed to obtain multi - band images over a substantial fraction of the sky every few nights .",
    "the survey will yield contiguous overlapping imaging of over half the sky in six optical bands , with each sky location visited about 1000 times over 10 years .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an overall summary of the main lsst science drivers and how they led to the current system design parameters (   [ sec : refdesign ] ) , to describe anticipated data products (   [ sec : dataprod ] ) , and to provide a few examples of the science programs that lsst will enable (   [ sec : science ] ) .",
    "the community involvement is discussed in   [ sec : community ] , and broad educational and societal impacts in ",
    "[ sec : impact ] .",
    "the concluding remarks are presented in   [ sec : conclusions ] . this publication will be maintained at the arxiv.org site , and will also be available from the lsst website ( www.lsst.org ) .",
    "the latest version should be consulted for the most up - to - date information about the lsst system .",
    "the most important characteristic that determines the speed at which a system can survey a given sky area to a given depth ( faint flux limit ) is its tendue ( or grasp ) , the product of its primary mirror area and the field - of - view area ( assuming that observing conditions such as seeing , sky brightness , etc . , are fixed ) .",
    "the effective tendue for lsst will be greater than 300 m@xmath0 deg@xmath0 , which is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of any existing facility .",
    "for example , the sdss , with its 2.5-m telescope ( gunn et al .",
    "2006 ) and a camera with 30 imaging ccds ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) , has an effective tendue of only 5.9 m@xmath0 deg@xmath0 .",
    "the range of scientific investigations which will be enabled by such a dramatic improvement in survey capability is extremely broad .",
    "guided by the community - wide input assembled in the report of the science working group of the lsst , the lsst is designed to achieve goals set by four main science themes :    1 .",
    "probing dark energy and dark matter 2 .   taking an inventory of the solar system 3 .   exploring the transient optical sky 4 .   mapping the milky way    each of these four themes itself encompasses a variety of analyses , with varying sensitivity to instrumental and system parameters .",
    "these themes fully exercise the technical capabilities of the system , such as photometric and astrometric accuracy and image quality .",
    "about 90% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep - wide - fast ( main ) survey mode .",
    "the working paradigm is that all scientific investigations will utilize a common database constructed from an optimized observing program ( the main survey mode ) , such as that discussed in section 3 .",
    "here we briefly describe the science goals and the most challenging requirements for the telescope and instrument that are derived from those goals , which will inform the overall system design decisions discussed below . for a more detailed discussion ,",
    "we refer the reader to the lsst science requirements document , as well as to the numerous lsst poster presentations at the recent meetings of the aas .",
    "the main science drivers are used to optimize various system parameters .",
    "ultimately , in this high - dimensional parameter space , there is a manifold defined by the total project cost .",
    "the science drivers must both justify this cost , as well as provide guidance on how to optimize various parameters while staying on the cost manifold .    here",
    "we summarize the dozen most important interlocking constraints on data properties placed by the four main science themes :    1 .",
    "the depth of a single visit ( an observation consisting of two back - to - back exposures of the same region of sky ) 2 .",
    "image quality 3 .",
    "photometric accuracy 4 .",
    "astrometric accuracy 5 .",
    "optimal exposure time 6 .   the filter complement 7 .   the distribution of revisit times ( i.e. , the cadence of observations ) , including the survey lifetime 8",
    ".   the total number of visits to a given area of sky 9 .   the coadded survey depth 10 .",
    "the distribution of visits on the sky , and the total sky coverage 11 .",
    "the distribution of visits per filter 12 .",
    "data processing and data access ( e.g. , time delay for reporting transient sources and the software contribution to measurement errors )    we present a detailed discussion of how these science - driven data properties are transformed to system parameters below .",
    "current models of cosmology require the existence of both dark matter and dark energy to match observational constraints ( spergel et al . 2007 ; riess et al . 2007 ;",
    "tegmark et al .",
    "2006 ; and references therein ) .",
    "dark energy affects the cosmic history of both the hubble expansion and mass clustering .",
    "if combined , different types of probes of the expansion history and structure history can lead to tight constraints ( a percent level precision ) on the dark energy equation of state and other cosmological parameters .",
    "these tight constraints arise because each technique depends on the cosmological parameters or errors in different ways .",
    "the most powerful probes include weak gravitational lens cosmic shear ( wl ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , supernovae ( sn ) , and cluster counting  all as functions of redshift . using the cosmic microwave background as normalization",
    ", the combination of these probes can yield the needed precision to distinguish among models of dark energy ( zhan 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , time - resolved strong galaxy and cluster lensing probes the physics of dark matter .",
    "this is because the positions and profiles of multiple images of a source galaxy depend sensitively on the total mass distribution , including the dark matter , in the lensing object .",
    "three major programs from this science theme provide unique and independent constraints on the system design :    * weak lensing of galaxies , * baryon acoustic oscillations * type ia supernovae .",
    "weak lensing ( wl ) techniques can be used to map the distribution of mass as a function of redshift and thereby trace the history of both the expansion of the universe and the growth of structure ( e.g. , hu & tegmark 1999 ; wittman et al .",
    "2000 ; for a review see bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) .",
    "weak lensing of galaxies as a function of redshift probes both the evolution of structure over cosmic time and determines dimensionless ratios of distances versus cosmic time , giving multiple independent constraints on the nature of dark energy .",
    "these investigations require deep wide - area multi - color imaging with stringent requirements on shear systematics in at least two bands , and excellent photometry in all bands ( a requirement shared with bao . )",
    "the strongest constraints on the lsst image quality come from this science program . in order to control systematic errors in shear measurement , it is mandatory to obtain the desired depth with many short exposures ( which enables reconstruction of galaxy shapes with minimum systematic error ) .",
    "detailed simulations of weak lensing techniques show that , in order to obtain a sample of @xmath63 billion lensing galaxies , the coadded map must cover @xmath620,000 deg@xmath0 , and reach a depth of @xmath5 ( 5@xmath1 for point sources ) , with several hundred exposures per field and sufficient signal - to - noise in at least five other bands to obtain accurate photometric redshifts .",
    "this depth optimizes the number of measured galaxies in ground - based seeing , and allows their detection in significant numbers to beyond a redshift of two .",
    "it is anticipated that optimal science analysis of weak lensing will place strong constraints on data processing software , such as simultaneous analysis of all the available images rather than analyzing a deep coadded image ( tyson et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "type ia supernovae ( sn ) provided the first evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) . to fully exploit the supernovae science potential , light curves sampled in multiple bands every few days over the course of a few months are required .",
    "this is essential to search for systematic differences in supernova populations ( e.g. , due to progenitor channels ) which may masquerade as cosmological effects , as well as to determine photometric redshifts from the supernovae themselves . unlike other cosmological probes",
    ", even a single object can provide useful constraints and , therefore , a large number of sn across the sky can enable a high angular resolution search for any dependence of dark energy properties on direction , which would be an indicator of new physics . given the expected sn flux distribution , the single visit depth should be at least @xmath7 .",
    "good image quality is required to separate sn photometrically from their host galaxies .",
    "observations in at least five photometric bands are necessary to ensure that , for any given supernova , light curves in several bands will be obtained ( due to the spread in redshift ) .",
    "the importance of k - corrections to supernova cosmology implies that the calibration of the relative offsets in photometric zero points between filters and the knowledge of the system response functions , especially near the edges of bandpasses , must be accurate to about 1% ( wood - vasey et al .",
    "similar photometric accuracy is required for photometric redshifts of galaxies .",
    "deeper data ( @xmath8 ) for small areas of the sky can extend the discovery of sn to a mean redshift of 0.7 ( from @xmath9 for the main survey ) , with some objects beyond @xmath101 ( garnavich et al . 2005 ; pinto et al .",
    "2005 ) . the added statistical leverage on the `` pre - acceleration '' era would improve constraints on the properties of dark energy as a function of redshift .",
    "the small - body populations in the solar system , such as asteroids , trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) and comets , are remnants of its early assembly .",
    "the history of accretion , collisional grinding , and perturbation by existing and vanished giant planets is preserved in the orbital elements and size distributions of those objects .",
    "collisions in the main asteroid belt between mars and jupiter still occur , and occasionally objects are ejected on orbits that may take them on a collision course with earth .    as a result , the earth orbits within a swarm of asteroids ; some number of these objects will ultimately strike the earth s surface . in december 2005 , the u.s .",
    "congress directed nasa to implement a near - earth object ( neo ) survey that would catalog 90% of neos",
    "larger than 140 meters by 2020 .",
    "about 20% of neos , the potentially hazardous asteroids or phas , are in orbits that pass sufficiently close to earth s orbit , to within 0.05 au , that perturbations with time scales of a century can lead to intersections and the possibility of collision . in order to fulfill the congressional mandate using a ground - based facility , a 10-meter class telescope equipped with a multi - gigapixel camera , and a sophisticated and robust data processing system",
    "are required ( ivezi et al .",
    "the search for neos also places strong constraints on the cadence of observations , requiring closely spaced pairs of observations ( two or preferably three times per lunation ) in order to link observations unambiguously and derive orbits .",
    "individual exposures should be shorter than about 30 seconds each to minimize the effects of trailing for the majority of moving objects .",
    "the images must be well sampled to enable accurate astrometry , with absolute accuracy of at least 0.1 arcsec .",
    "the images should reach a depth of at least @xmath624.5 ( 5@xmath1 for point sources ) in the @xmath11 band in order to probe the @xmath12 km size range at main - belt distances , and to fulfill the congressional neo mandate .",
    "the photometry should be better than 1 - 2% to enable color - based taxonomy .",
    "recent surveys have shown the power of measuring variability for studying gravitational lensing , searching for supernovae , determining the physical properties of gamma - ray burst sources , probing the structure of active galactic nuclei , and many other subjects at the forefront of astrophysics ( tyson 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "a wide - area dense temporal coverage to deep limiting magnitudes would enable the discovery and analysis of rare and exotic objects such as neutron star and black hole binaries , novae and stellar flares , gamma - ray bursts and x - ray flashes , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , stellar disruptions by black holes , and possibly new classes of transients , such as binary mergers of black holes ( shields & bonning 2008 ) . such a survey likely would detect numerous microlensing events in the local group and perhaps beyond , and open the possibility of discovering planets ( e.g. , beaulieu et al .",
    "2006 ) , as well as obtaining spectra of lensed stars in distant galaxies .",
    "time - domain science requires large area coverage to enhance the probability of detecting rare events ; good time sampling , because light curves are necessary to distinguish certain types of variables and in some cases to infer their properties ( e.g. , determining the intrinsic luminosity of type ia supernovae depends on measurements of their rate of decline ) ; accurate color information to assist with the classification of variable objects ; good image quality to enable differencing of images , especially in crowded fields ; and rapid data reduction , classification and reporting to the community in order to flag interesting objects for spectroscopic and other investigations with separate facilities .",
    "time scales ranging from 1 min , to constrain the properties of fast faint transients ( such as optical flashes associated with gamma - ray bursts ; bloom et al . 2008 ) and transients recently discovered by the deep lens survey ( becker et al .",
    "2004 ) , to 10 years to study long - period variables and quasars ( kaspi et al .",
    "2007 ) should be probed over a significant fraction of the sky .",
    "it should be possible to measure colors of fast transients , and to reach faint magnitude limits in individual visits ( at least the deep lens survey limit of @xmath2 ) .    0.5 in      a major objective of modern astrophysics is to understand when and how galaxies formed and evolved .",
    "arguably the biggest challenge to extragalactic cosmology today concerns the formation of structure on sub - galactic scales , where baryon physics becomes important , and where the nature of dark matter may manifest itself in observable ways . the milky way and its environment",
    "provide a unique data set for understanding the detailed processes that shape galaxy formation and for testing the small - scale predictions of our standard cosmology .",
    "however , we still lack robust answers to two basic questions about our galaxy :    * what is the detailed structure and accretion history of the milky way ? * what are the fundamental properties of all the stars within 300 pc of the sun ?    key requirements for mapping the galaxy are large area coverage , excellent image quality to maximize the photometric and astrometric accuracy , especially in crowded fields ; photometric precision of at least 1% to separate main sequence and giant stars ( e.g. , helmi et al , 2003 ) ; and astrometric precision of about 10 mas per observation to enable parallax and proper motion measurements . in order to probe the halo out to its presumed edge at @xmath6100 kpc ( ivezi et al .",
    "2003 ) using numerous main - sequence stars , the total coadded depth must reach @xmath13 , with a similar depth in the @xmath14 band . to study the metallicity distribution of stars in the sgr tidal stream ( e.g. , see majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) and other halo substructures at distances beyond the presumed boundary between inner and outer halo ( @xmath630 kpc , carollo et al . 2007 ) , the coadded depth in the @xmath15 band must reach @xmath16 .",
    "to detect rr lyrae stars beyond the galaxy s tidal radius at @xmath6300 kpc , the single - visit depth must be @xmath2 . in order to measure the tangential velocity of stars at a distance of 10 kpc , where the halo dominates over the disk , to within 10 km / s needed to be competitive with large - scale radial velocity surveys , the required proper motion accuracy is at least 0.2 mas / yr . the same accuracy follows from the requirement to obtain the same proper motion accuracy as gaia ( perryman et al .",
    "2001 ) at its faint limit ( @xmath17 ) . in order to produce a complete sample of solar neighborhood stars out to a distance of 300 pc ( the thin disk scale height ) , with 3@xmath1 or better geometric distances ,",
    "trigonometric parallax measurements accurate to 1 mas are required . to achieve the required proper motion and parallax accuracy with an assumed astrometric accuracy of 10 mas per observation per coordinate , approximately 1,000 observations are required .",
    "this requirement on the number of observations is in good agreement with the independent constraint implied by the difference between the total depth and the single - visit depth .",
    "= 500 nm , and corrected using an outer scale parameter of 30 m over an 8.4 m aperture . for details about the outer scale correction see tokovinin ( 2002 ) .",
    "the observed distribution is well described by a log - normal distribution , using the parameters shown in the figure . ]",
    "the goals of all the science programs discussed above ( and many more , of course ) can be accomplished by satisfying the following minimal constraints    1 .   _ the single visit depth _ should reach @xmath2 .",
    "this limit is primarily driven by the neo survey and variable sources ( e.g. , sn , rr lyrae stars ) , and by proper motion and trigonometric parallax measurements for stars .",
    "indirectly , it is also driven by the requirements on the coadded survey depth and the minimum number of exposures placed by wl science .",
    "image quality _ should maintain the limit set by the atmosphere ( the median free - air seeing is 0.7 arcsec in the @xmath11 band at the chosen site , see fig .",
    "[ fig : seeing ] ) , and not be degraded appreciably by the hardware .",
    "in addition to stringent constraints from weak lensing , good image quality is driven by the required survey depth for point sources and by image differencing techniques .",
    "3 .   _ photometric repeatability _ should achieve 5 mmag precision at the bright end , with zeropoint stability across the sky of 10 mmag and band - to - band calibration errors not larger than 5 mmag .",
    "these requirements are driven by the photometric redshift accuracy , the separation of stellar populations , detection of low - amplitude variable objects ( such as eclipsing planetary systems ) , and the search for systematic effects in type ia supernova light curves .",
    "4 .   _ astrometric precision _ should maintain the limit set by the atmosphere , of about 10 mas per visit at the bright end ( on scales below 20 arcmin ) .",
    "this precision is driven by the desire to achieve a proper motion accuracy of 0.2 mas / yr and parallax accuracy of 1.0 mas over the course of a 10-year survey ( see  [ sec : apsize ] ) .",
    "5 .   _ the single visit exposure time _ ( including both exposures in a visit ) should be less than about a minute to prevent trailing of fast moving objects and to aid control of various systematic effects induced by the atmosphere .",
    "it should be longer than @xmath620 seconds to avoid significant efficiency losses due to finite readout , slew time , and read noise .",
    "the filter complement _ should include at least six filters in the wavelength range limited by atmospheric absorption and silicon detection efficiency ( 3201050 nm ) , with roughly rectangular filters and no large gaps in the coverage , in order to enable robust and accurate photometric redshifts and stellar typing .",
    "an sdss - like @xmath15 band is extremely important for separating low - redshift quasars from hot stars , and for estimating the metallicities of f / g main sequence stars .",
    "a bandpass with an effective wavelength of about 1 micron would enable studies of sub - stellar objects , high - redshift quasars ( to redshifts of @xmath67.5 ) , and regions of the galaxy that are obscured by interstellar dust .",
    "7 .   _ the revisit time distribution _ should enable determination of orbits of solar system objects and sample sn light curves every few days , while accommodating constraints set by proper motion and trigonometric parallax measurements . 8 .   _",
    "the total number of visits _ of any given area of sky , when accounting for all filters , should be of the order of 1,000 , as mandated by wl science , the neo survey , and proper motion and trigonometric parallax measurements .",
    "studies of transient sources also benefit from a larger number of visits . 9 .   _ the coadded survey depth _ should reach @xmath5 , with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio in other bands to address both extragalactic and galactic science drivers . 10 . _ the distribution of visits per filter _ should enable accurate photometric redshifts , separation of stellar populations , and sufficient depth to enable detection of faint extremely red sources ( e.g. , brown dwarfs and high - redshift quasars ) .",
    "detailed simulations of photometric redshift estimates suggest an approximately flat distribution of visits among bandpasses ( because the system throughput and atmospheric properties are wavelength dependent , the achieved depths are different in different bands ) .",
    "the adopted time allocation ( see table 1 ) gives a slight preference to the @xmath11 and @xmath18 bands because of their dominant role in star / galaxy separation and weak lensing measurements .",
    "11 . _ the distribution of visits on the sky",
    "_ should extend over at least @xmath620,000 deg@xmath0 to obtain the required number of galaxies for wl studies , with attention paid to include `` special '' regions such as the ecliptic , galactic plane , and the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "_ data processing , data products and data access _ should enable efficient science analysis without a significant impact on the final uncertainties . to enable a fast and efficient response to transient sources ,",
    "the processing latency should be less than a minute , with a robust and accurate preliminary classification of reported transients .",
    "remarkably , even with these joint requirements , none of the individual science programs is severely over - designed .",
    "that is , despite their significant scientific diversity , these programs are highly compatible in terms of desired data characteristics .",

    "( instead of science - specific surveys executed in series ) .",
    "one can think of this as _ massively parallel astrophysics_. the vast majority ( about 90% ) of the observing time will be devoted to a deep - wide - fast survey mode , with the remaining 10% of observing time allocated to special programs which will also address multiple science goals . before describing these surveys in detail",

    "the skymapper survey will obtain imaging data in the southern sky to similar depths as sdss , the pan - starrs surveys will provide multi - epoch data deeper than sdss in the northern sky , and the dark energy survey ( flaugher 2006 ) will scan @xmath65000 deg@xmath0 to similar depth as pan - starrs in the southern sky . despite the lack of the @xmath15 band data and a shallower depth by about a magnitude , the pan - starrs surveys will represent a valuable complement to lsst in providing an all - sky coverage to a limit fainter than that of sdss and skymapper .",
    "lsst and gaia will be complementary datasets for studying the milky way in the multi - dimensional space of three - dimensional positions , proper motions and metallicity .",
    "the gaia survey will provide calibration checks at the bright end for proper motions and trigonometric parallax measurements by lsst , and lsst will extend the gaia survey four magnitudes deeper . the lsst data stream will invigorate subsequent investigations by numerous other telescopes that will provide additional temporal , spectral and spatial resolution coverage .",
    "lsst will provide a crucial complementary capability to planned space experiments operating in other bands , such as the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) and the black hole finder einstein probe mission .",
    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) is designed to study black hole mergers through the gravitational wave outburst that should be emitted during the final stages of such events .",
    "lsst has the potential to measure the electromagnetic signal that accompanies the gravitational wave emission , thereby providing a definite position on the sky for the system , which is crucial for follow - up observations .",
    "lsst will also make the archives for billion - dollar class space missions such as chandra , xmm - newton , spitzer , etc .",
    ", much more valuable , because deep optical multi - color data will enable massive photometric follow - up studies of sources from these missions .",
    "last but not least , the huge samples of various astronomical source populations will yield extremely rare objects for follow - up by powerful facilities such as jwst ( gardner et al .",
    "2006 ) and gsmt ( kan & antebi 2003 ) .    in summary",
    ", the diversity of science enabled by lsst will be unparalleled , extending from the physics of gravity and the early universe to the properties of `` killer '' asteroids ( phas ) . while there are other projects that aim to address some of the same science goals , no other project matches this diversity and lsst s potential impact on society in general .",
    "lsst has been conceived as a public facility : the database that it will produce , and the associated object catalogs that are generated from that database , will be made available to the scientific community and to the public at large with no proprietary period .",
    "the lsst data management system will provide user - friendly tools to access this database and to support user - initiated queries , run on lsst computers , either at the archive facility or at the data access centers .",
    "we expect that many , perhaps even the majority of lsst discoveries will come from research astronomers with no formal affiliation to the project , from students , and from interested amateurs , intrigued by the accessibility to the universe that this facility uniquely provides .",
    "for example , because of its interest in the large public data access of the lsst program , the google corporation has recently joined the lsst team .",
    "the sdss provides a good example for how the scientific community can be effective in working with large , publicly available astronomical data sets .",
    "the sdss has put out a series of large incremental data releases via a sophisticated database , roughly once per year , together with a paper describing the content of each data release , and extensive on - line documentation giving instructions on downloading the catalogs and image data ( see http://www.sdss.org ) . over 60% of the more than 1800 refereed papers based on sdss data to date ( may 2008 ) have been written by people from outside the project , and include many of the most high - profile results that have come from the facility .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that many of the highest priority lsst science investigations will require organized teams of professionals working together to optimize science analyses and to assess the importance of systematic uncertainties on the derived results . to meet this need , ten science collaborations",
    "have already been established by the project in core science areas ( strauss 2007 ) .    as of the time of this contribution , there are close to 200 participants in these collaborations , mostly from lsst member institutions .",
    "as the project proceeds into development , an open call for applications for membership will be issued to the professional community at large .",
    "it is anticipated that the lsst science collaborations will perform their analyses using lsst computational facilities , and the system has been sized accordingly .",
    "as we design our observing strategies , we are actively seeking and implementing input by the wide community of scientists in the lsst science collaborations .",
    "their task , among others , is to enhance the lsst science case and provide advice on how to optimize their science with choices in cadence , software , and data systems .",
    "the science collaborations are expected to play a major role in the system optimization during the commissioning period .",
    "we will continue this review when the survey starts , and will maintain our design of flexible cadence structure .",
    "the impact  and enduring societal significance  of the lsst will exceed its direct contributions to advances in physics and astronomy . with an open database available in real time to the non - specialist public , lsst has the capacity to literally bring the universe home to everyone .",
    "the `` movie of the universe '' will offer a new window on the sky for curious minds of all ages .",
    "any interested amateur , anywhere in the world , will be able to log on to his or her computer and look at the latest images of any part of the sky1920 pixel resolution ) to display a single - epoch lsst image of half the celestial sphere ( and about 1000 such images will be obtained over 10 years ) . ] . in the context of open source development , as we have witnessed recently in community contributions to google sky , the value added for public interest and interaction is enormous .",
    "lsst will allow people to see that they are part of a dynamic universe .",
    "user - friendly visualization interfaces will enable new research as well as being a vehicle for education and public involvement .",
    "elementary school students in earth science classes can participate in the discovery of new asteroids .",
    "high school and college students can discover supernovae and measure their light curves , thereby learning about both measurement processes and cosmology .",
    "the implications for all levels of scientific , engineering , and technical education can not be overstated .",
    "the lsst education and public outreach ( epo ) program will provide tools for the public , museum visitors , and students not only to examine and understand the achievements of lsst , but also to participate in the process of scientific discovery . with partners and collaborators such as the google corporation , the american museum of natural history , the las cumbres observatory global telescope network , and others , a number of innovative programs have been devised : an internet - based public outreach system called involving citizen - scientists , advanced visualization demonstrations at the hayden and adler planetaria , formal educational programs focused on solar system science and cosmology , teacher training , and the development of new software epo tools .",
    "lsst is perfectly positioned to bring such a transformative epo program to fruition .",
    "until recently , most astronomical investigations have focused on small samples of cosmic sources or individual objects . over the past decade ,",
    "however , advances in technology have made it possible to move beyond the traditional observational paradigm and to undertake large - scale sky surveys , such as sdss , 2mass , galex and many others .",
    "this observational progress , based on a synergy of advances in telescope construction , detectors , and above all , information technology , has had a dramatic impact on nearly all fields of astronomy , many areas of fundamental physics , and society in general .",
    "the lsst builds on the experience of these surveys and addresses the broad goals stated in several nationally endorsed reports by the u.s",
    ". national academy of sciences .",
    "the realization of the lsst involves extraordinary engineering and technological challenges : the fabrication of large , high - precision optics ; construction of a huge , highly - integrated array of sensitive , wide - band imaging sensors ; and the operation of a data management facility handling tens of terabytes of data each day .",
    "the design and development effort , which has been underway since 2006 and will continue through the onset of construction , includes structural , thermal , and optical analyses of all key hardware subsystems , vendor interactions to determine manufacturability , explicit prototyping of high - risk elements , prototyping and development of data management systems , and extensive systems engineering studies .",
    "over 100 technical personnel at a range of institutions are currently engaged in this program .    in september 2007",
    ", lsst passed the nsf conceptual design review for construction , which puts it on track for the preliminary design review around the end of 2008 .",
    "the casting of the primary / tertiary mirror is in progress and it reached a peak temperature of approximately 1165 @xmath70 on march 29@xmath71 , 2008 .",
    "the lsst design and development phase will continue for another 3 years under nsf support along with in - kind contributions and private gifts .",
    "it is proposed that the u.s .",
    "department of energy support the cost of constructing the camera .",
    "lsst has high visibility in the high - energy physics community , both at universities and government laboratories .",
    "the project is scheduled to have first light in 2014 and the beginning of survey operations in 2015 .",
    "the lsst survey will open a movie - like window on objects that change brightness , or move , on timescales ranging from 10 seconds to 10 years . the survey will have a data rate of about 30 tb / night ( more than one complete sloan digital sky survey per night ) , and",
    "will collect over 60 pb of raw data over its lifetime , resulting in an incredibly rich and extensive public archive that will be a treasure trove for breakthroughs in many areas of astronomy and physics .",
    "about 10 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars will be detected ",
    "_ for the first time in history , the number of cataloged celestial objects will exceed the number of living people ! _ about a thousand observations of each position across half of the celestial sphere will represent the greatest movie of all time : assuming hdtv resolution ( 2.1 mpix / frame ) with 30 frames per second , and 270 color images per position ( e.g. , the @xmath72 and @xmath73 color - composites , c.f . table 1 ) , it would take about eleven uninterrupted months to view this color movie ( equivalent to about 4,000 feature films ) .",
    "the cost estimate for lsst is $ 389 m for construction and $ 37 m per year for operations ( in 2006 u.s .",
    "dollars ) .",
    "lsst will be much more efficient than the current state - of - the - art massive optical survey , the sdss .",
    "for example , for each $ 100 spent , the sdss obtained single - epoch @xmath36 photometry for @xmath6200 sources and a spectrum for a single source .",
    "in contrast , for $ 100 lsst will obtain @xmath4 photometry for more than 2,000 sources ( to a limit 5 magnitudes deeper than sdss ) and a 1000-point light curve for @xmath6200 sources .",
    "compared to the sdss , lsst will produce about 2,000 times larger data volume with an increase in total cost of less than a factor of ten .",
    "lsst has been conceived as a public facility : the database that it will produce , and the associated object catalogs that are generated from that database , will be made available to the world s scientific community and to the public at large with no proprietary period .",
    "the software which creates the lsst database will be open source . _ lsst will be a significant milestone in the globalization of the information revolution .",
    "_ lsst will put terabytes of data each night into the hands of anyone that wants to explore it , and in some sense will become an internet telescope : the ultimate network peripheral device to explore the universe , and a shared resource for all humanity .      in 2003 ,",
