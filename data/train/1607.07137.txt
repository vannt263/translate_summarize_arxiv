    "the principles underlying the general theory of relativity states that the space - time is a dynamical object which has independent degrees of freedom , and is governed by the einstein field equations .",
    "this means that in general relativity ( gr ) the geometry is dynamically determined .",
    "therefore , the construction of a gauge theory of gravity requires an action that does not consider a fixed space - time background .",
    "an action for gravity fulfilling these conditions , albeit only in odd - dimensional space - time , @xmath4 , was proposed long ago by chamseddine  @xcite .",
    "if chern - simons theories are the appropriate gauge - theories to provide a framework for the gravitational interaction , then these theories must satisfy the correspondence principle , namely they must be related to general relativity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite was shown that the standard , five - dimensional general relativity ( without a cosmological constant ) can be obtained from chern - simons gravity theory for a certain lie algebra @xmath5 .",
    "the chern - simons lagrangian is built from a @xmath5-valued , one - form gauge connection @xmath6 which depends on a scale parameter @xmath7 which can be interpreted as a coupling constant that characterizes different regimes within the theory .",
    "the @xmath5 algebra , on the other hand , is obtained from the ads algebra and a particular semigroup @xmath8 by means of the s - expansion procedure introduced in refs .",
    "the field content induced by @xmath5 includes the vielbein @xmath9 , the spin connection @xmath10 and two extra bosonic fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite was then shown that it is possible to recover odd - dimensional einstein gravity theory from a chern - simons theory in the limit where the coupling constant @xmath7 tends to zero while keeping the effective newton s constant fixed .    in ref .",
    "@xcite was considered a 5-dimensional lagrangian @xmath13 which is composed of a gravitational sector and a sector of matter , where the gravitational sector is given by the so called einstein - chern - simons gravity action @xmath14 instead of the einstein - hilbert action and where the matter sector is given by the so called perfect fluid . in this reference was studied the implications that has on the cosmological evolution , the fact of replacing the einstein - hilbert action by the chern - simons action in the gravitational sector , for a metric of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) . using a compactification procedure known as dynamic compactification , was found that the cosmological field equations obtained from the chern - simons gravity theory lead , in a certain limit , to the usual 4-dimensional frw equations .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to find some new cosmological solutions for the so called einstein - chern - simons - friedmann - robertson - walker field equations , and to show how such new solutions lead , in a certain limit , to the usual cosmological solutions of einstein theory of gravitation .    to find the new cosmological solutions we interpret the @xmath11 field as the dark energy in three different cases :    in the first case we interpret the @xmath0 field as a perfect fluid that obeys a barotropic equation of state ;    in the second case we interpret the @xmath0 field as a politropic fluid that obeys the equation @xmath15 and    in the third case we interpret the @xmath0 field as a variable modified chaplygin gas .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec02 ] we briefly review the called einstein - chern - simons friedmann - robertson - walker field equations and their solutions when the standard energy - momentum tensor is modeled as a barotropic fluid . in section [ sec03 ]",
    "we study three cases where @xmath11 field is interpreted as the dark energy and the standard energy - momentum tensor is modeled as a barotropic fluid with variable parameter of state @xmath16 . in the first case , we assume that the @xmath0 field is a perfect fluid which obeys the barotropic equation of state @xmath17 , with @xmath18 a constant , and then we find some solutions of the five - dimensional chs - frw field equations . in the second case , we study the case when the @xmath0 field is a five dimensional politropic fluid which obeys @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , where some solutions for @xmath1 are found . in the third case , the scale factor and",
    "the state parameter @xmath3 are found when the @xmath0 field is a variable modified chaplygin gas . in section [ sec06 ] a space - time metric which contain as a subspace the usual four - dimensional frw metric",
    "is found and then we studied the same three cases considered in the five - dimensional case . a summary concludes this work .",
    "in this section we review the frw field equations obtained from the lagrangian ( [ eins ] ) and some of their solutions . from ref . @xcite we know that the echs - frw field equations are given by , @xmath21 + \\alpha l^{2}\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a}\\left ( \\frac{\\dot{a}^{2}+k}{a^{2}}\\right ) & = -\\kappa _ { 1}p , % \\label{80y9 } \\\\",

    "henceforth we assume @xmath25 is a positive constant .",
    "the metric tensor of space - time is given by a frw metric - type , i.e. , @xmath26 is the cosmic scale factor and @xmath27 is the curvature of 4-dimensional space . on the other hand ,",
    "the standard matter is a perfect fluid whose proper energy ( or mass ) density is @xmath28 and its proper pressure is @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the energy density and pressure for the perfect fluid associated to the @xmath11 field , also in the comoving frame .",
    "the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the components of @xmath11 field @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the vielbein one - form .",
    "when one consider the case @xmath36 these equations take the form @xmath37where we have introduced the hubble parameter @xmath38 .      following the same procedure used in general relativity , we further assume that the perfect fluid obeys the barotropic equation of state @xmath39where @xmath18 can be a time - dependent function or a constant .",
    "if @xmath40 is a constant then , introducing ( [ 117 ] ) in ( [ vier ] ) we obtain @xmath41 the subscript zero means evaluation at the present time @xmath42 .    using equations ( [ drei ] ) , ( [ vier ] ) and ( [ 117 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath43 this is the equation giving the behavior of the scale factor @xmath44 and is to be solved for the cases when the parameter is uniquely @xmath45 and the general case when @xmath46 .      if @xmath45 , the equation ( [ 118 ] ) reduces to @xmath48 since we have assumed that @xmath49 the last equation leads to @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the hubble constant .",
    "this solution leads to @xmath52which is a de sitter - type solution with @xmath53 .",
    "since equation ( [ drei ] ) is a quadratic equation in @xmath54 its solution yields a value for the hubble parameter of the form @xmath55    if we consider the case of small @xmath56 limit , we can expand the root to first order in @xmath56 . in the expansion we can see that it is necessary to take the negative sign in front of square root to recover the frw equations when @xmath57 .",
    "thus in first order approximation , equation ( [ 124 ] ) takes the form @xmath58or @xmath59expression that in the @xmath57 limit is identical to that obtained when using the einstein equations in five dimensions .",
    "we consider now the behavior of the scale factor for the general case when @xmath18 is left as a free parameter . by integrating equation ( [ 118 ] ) with @xmath60",
    "we obtain @xmath61where @xmath62 and we have defined @xmath63 . in the small @xmath56 limit , we can expand equation ( [ 123 ] ) .",
    "in fact , taking the @xmath64 of each side of ( [ 123 ] ) , carrying out the expansion to first order in @xmath65 and solving for the hubble parameter , we obtain @xmath66 expanding the square root in ( [ 129 ] ) to second order in @xmath67 , considering the negative sign to recover the five - dimensional frw equations , and integrating , we obtain a value for the scale factor of the form @xmath68where @xmath69    from equation ( [ 131 ] ) we see that :    the cases of greatest physical interest are those with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which are in the category @xmath60 .",
    "these cases are usually called the eras of matter and radiation respectively .    for small values of @xmath56 and for values not small of @xmath72 we have that the term the right in ( [ 131 ] )",
    "is negligible compared to the first and we recover the usual solutions to the 5-dimensional frw equations .    in case that @xmath72 is the order of @xmath56 we have that the term on the right in ( [ 131 ] ) is not negligible compared to the first and therefore becomes important in the description of evolution : this is a notable difference with the results obtained from general relativity . if the term on the right in ( [ 131 ] ) takes a value greater than zero , then it is possible that this term is important for the description of an inflationary period of the universe .",
    "we should note that this solution corresponds to a valid theory in five dimensions which describes the evolution of 5-dimensional space - time .",
    "in this section we will assume that the standard matter perfect fluid is a barotropic fluid with variable parameter of state , i.e. , which obeys the equation of state @xmath73here @xmath40 can be a time - dependent function",
    ". we will study the behavior of the scale factor @xmath44 , the energy density and the variable parameter @xmath16 .",
    "now , we assume that the perfect fluid asociated to @xmath11 field obeys the barotropic equation of state @xmath74where @xmath75 is a constant parameter of state .",

    "a.   if the behavior of two fluids is studied and if we want describe , in the context of standard cosmology , a universe accelerated at a late stage , then one of the fluids may represent dark matter described by the equation of state @xmath267 ( con @xmath268 ) , while the other may represent dark energy described by the equation of state @xmath269 ( con @xmath270 ) .",
    "+ in this case we can consider that each fluid evolves independently of each other or take the option of considering that there is an interaction term between the two fluids @xmath271 , this means that fluids will not evolve independently and behavior of a fluid depend on the behavior of the other .",
    "b.   if in the context of cosmology einstein - chern - simons we consider that the matter field of density @xmath28 represents dark matter ( or dark energy ) and that the @xmath0 field of density @xmath30 represents dark energy ( or dark matter ) then , if the two fluids evolve independently of each other , we find that the behavior of a fluid depends on the behavior of the other fluid through the geometric term @xmath272 .",
    "this term plays the role of the interaction @xmath271 term present in the case of standard cosmology .",
    "c.   if in standard cosmology we consider two fluids , one with a constant state parameter and the other with a variable state parameter then , to solve the system dynamics it is necessary to specify the state equations for each fluid and consider an ansatz for the variable parameter state , giving the scale factor or giving an energy density .",
    "d.   in einstein - chern - simons cosmology , this situation can be resolved without considering an ansatz , closing down the system and getting the form of the different cosmological variables .",
