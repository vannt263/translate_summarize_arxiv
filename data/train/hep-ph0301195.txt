    "suppression of jet production or jet quenching in high - energy nuclear collisions has been proposed as a good probe of the hot and dense medium @xcite that is produced during the violent collisions .",
    "the quenching of an energetic parton is caused by multiple scattering and induced parton energy loss during its propagation through the hot qcd medium .",
    "it suppresses the final leading hadron distribution giving rise to modified fragmentation functions and the final hadron spectra @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical estimates @xcite all show that the effective parton energy loss is proportional to the gluon density of the medium",
    ". therefore measurements of the parton energy loss will enable one to extract the initial gluon density of the produced hot medium .",
    "strong suppression of high transverse momentum hadron spectra is indeed observed by experiments @xcite at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) , indicating large parton energy loss in a medium with large initial gluon density .",
    "however , one can not unambiguously extract the initial gluon density from the experiments of heavy - ion collisions alone because of the theoretical uncertainty in relating the parton energy loss to the initial gluon density .",
    "for this purpose , one has to rely on other complimentary experimental measurements such as parton energy loss in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) of nuclear targets .",
    "one can then at least extract the initial gluon density in heavy - ion collisions relative to that in a cold nucleus @xcite .    modified quark fragmentation function inside a nucleus in dis and the effective parton energy loss has been derived recently by guo and wang @xcite .",
    "generalized factorization of twist - four processes @xcite was applied to the inclusive process of jet fragmentation in dis in order to derive the modified fragmentation functions . taking into account of gluon bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering and the landau - pomeranchuck - migdal ( lpm ) interference effect",
    ", one finds that the leading twist - four contributions to the modified fragmentation function and the effective parton energy loss depend quadratically on the nuclear size @xmath0 .",
    "they also depend linearly on the effective gluon distribution in nuclei .",
    "one can also extend the study to parton propagation inside a hot qcd medium reproducing earlier results @xcite .",
    "this allows one to relate parton energy loss in both hot and cold nuclear medium .",
    "there are all together 23 cut - diagrams that contribute to the leading twist - four corrections to the quark fragmentation function in @xmath1 dis . for simplification of the calculation ,",
    "the helicity amplitude approximation was used in ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit of soft gluon radiation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the momentum fraction carried by the radiated gluon and @xmath4 the fraction carried by the leading quark .",
    "such an approximation enables one to simplify the calculation of the radiation amplitudes .",
    "the final results are obtained by squaring the sum of all possible amplitudes , giving rise not only to the contributions of double scattering but also various interferences . in this approximation ,",
    "the amplitudes of initial and final state radiation are the same except the opposite signs and different color matrices . because of the different color matrices in the initial and final state radiation",
    ", there is no complete cancellation of the radiation amplitudes .",
    "in addition , there is also gluon radiation from the exchanged gluon via triple - gluon coupling .",
    "these non - abelian features of qcd radiation lead to a finite gluon spectra even in the helicity amplitude approximation",
    ". however , under the same approximation , the photon spectra from qed bremsstrahlung would be zero because of almost complete cancellation between initial and final state radiation .",
    "one therefore has to go beyond the helicity approximation . in this paper",
    ", we will study the correction to the gluon radiation spectra when we go beyond the helicity amplitude approximation and its effect in the modified quark fragmentation function .",

    "in a nuclear medium , the propagating quark in dis will experience additional scatterings with other partons from the nucleus .",
    "the rescatterings may induce additional gluon radiation and cause the leading quark to lose energy .",
    "such induced gluon radiations will effectively give rise to additional terms in the evolution equation leading to the modification of the fragmentation functions in a medium .",
