    "the so - called schwarzschild interior solutions obtained by using einstein s field equations corresponding to various spherically symmetric static perfect fluid distributions usually suffer from the well - known problem of singularity .",
    "an uncharged incompressible fluid sphere of mass @xmath0 can not be held in equilibrium below certain radius @xmath1 and even demands a larger value for @xmath2 related to physically reasonable equation of state  @xcite .",
    "one way to overcome this singularity due to gravitational collapsing of a spherically symmetric material distribution is to include charge to the neutral case .",
    "it is observed that gravitational collapse can be averted in the presence of charge where gravitational attraction is counter balanced by the electrical repulsion in addition to the pressure gradient  @xcite    but even then many questions came up regarding the stability of the charged sphere and also about the amount of charge .",
    "bonnor  @xcite worked on this type of charge inclusion model and showed that a dust cloud of arbitrarily large mass and small radius can remain in equilibrium if it has an electric charge density related to the mass density by @xmath3 . according to stettner  @xcite ,",
    "a fluid sphere of uniform density with a net surface charge is more stable than without charge .",
    "however , glazer  @xcite by considering radial pulsations showed that bonnor  @xcite model is electrically unstable .",
    "he also explicitly established the effects of electric charge upon dynamical stability  @xcite .",
    "the work of whitman and burch  @xcite , for arbitrary charge and mass distribution showed how charged analogue cases give more stability .",
    "they also applied the pulsation equations to the charged solution of pant and sah  @xcite , which represents the charged analogue of tolman  @xcite solution of type vi , and got unsatisfactory results in connection to the boundary condition which is incompatible with densities and pressures .",
    "de felice et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a model for charged perfect fluid and concluded that inclusion of charge inhibits the growth of space - time curvature which has a great role to avoid singularities .",
    "however , very recently ray et al .",
    "@xcite and ghezzi  @xcite have studied the effect of electric charge on compact stars assuming the charge distribution is proportional to the mass density . both the group have argued that with the huge amount of charge and strong electric field these type of stars would be unstable and eventually would form charged black holes .",
    "therefore , starting from the very well - known weyl - majumdar - papapetrou  @xcite type general relativistic charged dust solutions , via bonnor  @xcite and several others ( some of which have been mentioned in the above introductory discussions ) , one can arrive at the realm of charged compact stellar objects .",
    "but a genuine question can be raised in this context that : what about the normal stars , do they carry electric charge and if at all , what will be the stability of their configurations ? as such regarding the effect of charge and possibility of holding charge by the stars are not unavailable in the past literature  @xcite . as a continuation of such study shvartsman",
    "@xcite argued that while astrophysical systems are usually thought to be electrically neutral , this may not be always true in the real situation .",
    "his analysis is based on the exchange processes between stars and the surrounding medium .",
    "very recently , neslusan  @xcite has reminded about the existence of global electrostatic field of the sun and other normal stars .",
    "he has given a general charge - mass relation @xmath4/q$ ] where @xmath5 is the primitivity of vacuum , @xmath6 is the gravitational constant , @xmath7 is the stellar mass in the sphere of radius @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the mass of proton and electron having charge @xmath11 , while @xmath12 is the global electrostatic charge inside the star .",
    "he got it to be @xmath13 when @xmath12 in coulomb and @xmath7 in solar masses corresponding to an ideally quiet , perfectly spherical , non - rotating star .",
    "so , motivated by all the above facts regarding the charged sphere in connection to normal stars , we have considered here charge analogue of tolman vi  @xcite and bayin  @xcite type solutions which represent very important class of astrophysical solutions . however , in a series of work ray and das  @xcite have already been studied some specific aspects of these type of solutions in different context . in the present work",
    "we analyze different physical properties of the static charged stellar model .",
    "we show that some cases provide _ electromagnetic mass model _ ( emmm ) where all the physical parameters , including the gravitational mass , vanish due to vanishing charge density  @xcite .",
    "it has also shown that emmm do exists even with positive pressure which clearly contradicts the observation done by ivanov  @xcite that emmm are allways associated with repulsive pressure .",
    "the effect of charge inclusion in these emmm , along with other solutions , has been investigated thoroughly in connection to mass - radius and mass - charge relations . the nature of fluid pressure and mass density throughout the fluid sphere have also been discussed .",
    "let us consider a static spherically symmetric matter distribution corresponding to the line element @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are function of the radial coordinate @xmath8 only .",
    "then the set of einstein - maxwell field equations , in the co - moving coordinates , for the above line element may be explicitly written  @xcite as @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 = 8\\pi p + \\frac{q^2}{r^4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the total charge within a sphere of radius @xmath8 , in terms of the 4-current @xmath20 , can be given by @xmath21",

    "we also notice that for @xmath143 , total charge to total mass ratio becomes constant in each case and it is greater than unity .",

    "@xcite that _ if the total electric charge of a perfect fluid ball is smaller than its total mass , then there is no regular static configuration having a radius arbitrarily close to the size of the external horizon_. therefore , the above four cases again give support in favor of the stability of the charged spherical models in connection to normal stars .",
