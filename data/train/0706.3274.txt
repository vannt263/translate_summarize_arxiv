    "for a few years many breakthroughs have been achieved in the field of asteroseismology of @xmath0  cephei stars thanks to several observational photometric and spectroscopic multi - site campaigns and long - term monitoring dedicated to this kind of pulsating b - type stars .",
    "the aim is to improve our knowledge of their internal structure and more precisely of two mixing processes that affect their evolutionary path : core overshooting and internal rotation .",
    "the first detailed asteroseismic modelling was performed for , which led to constraints on global stellar parameters but also on the core overshooting parameter .",
    "moreover the non - rigid rotation of the star was proved ( aerts et al .",

    "finally , the seismic interpretation by mazumdar et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed the occurrence of core overshooting for @xmath0  cma .",
    "the derived overshooting parameter values are 0.10@xmath100.05 , 0.05@xmath100.05 , 0.20@xmath100.05 and 0.20@xmath100.05 for v836 cen , @xmath16 eri , @xmath17  ceti and @xmath0  cma , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0  cephei star was also the subject of intensive photometric and spectroscopic observations as described in handler et al .",

    "we present our modelling based on accurate frequency determination and successful mode identitification obtained in paperi and ii .",
    "our main objective is to test if the occurrence of core overshooting and non - rigid rotation found for also applies to .",

    "we end with a conclusion in section7 .",
    "the observational pulsation characteristics of derived in paperi and ii can be summarized as follows .",
    "the photometric data ( paperi ) were gathered in the framework of a three - site campaign , allowing the detection of seven pulsation frequencies .",
    "the identification of their corresponding @xmath18-value showed the presence of one radial mode , one rotationally split @xmath2 triplet and three components of a rotationally split @xmath3 quintuplet .",
    "in addition , the spectroscopic observations ( paperii ) lifted the ambiguity for the @xmath4-value of the observed @xmath3 main mode .",
    "the pulsation frequencies and their @xmath19-values are listed in table[log ] .",
    "we note that such a frequency spectrum was observed for the star ( aerts et al .",
    "we also point out that the mode identifications of all the observed components of the quintuplet are determined for , which was not the case for .",
    "the position of appropriate models will be compared with the position of the star in the hr diagram that was determined photometrically and spectroscopically in paperi and ii .",
    "the obtained error boxes are represented in fig.[hr ] .",
    "we note that such a deviation between photometrically and spectroscopically derived effective temperatures is common for b - type stars ( e.g.  de ridder et al .",

    "this code needs as input the spherically symmetric component of the structure model ; it determines a posteriori the second order deformation due to rotation . in principle , the gravity must be corrected for the effect of centrifugal acceleration already in the spherically symmetric component of the model .",
    "this correction would affect very slightly the frequencies ( slow rotation ) and has a negligible effect on the multiplet asymmetries .",

    "this gives the linear differential rotation law : @xmath42 .",
    "as for the first order analysis , we see that rigid rotation models can not be eliminated .",
    "the results of table  [ rotth ] show that the non - equidistance of the @xmath15 triplet is relatively well reproduced by the second order effect of rotation .",
    "however , the asymmetries of the @xmath29 multiplet do not fit the observations .",
    "this discrepancy could come from observations ( multiplet not entirely resolved ) or theory ( effect of higher order terms ) .",
    "we did the same analysis with other models fitting the zonal mode frequencies and find quasi - identical results for the rotation velocity .",
    "our study of the @xmath0  cephei star @xmath1  ophiuchi is a new illustration of the power of asteroseismology for this class of pulsators .",
    "the couple @xmath43 being chosen , the observation of three independent modes is enough to derive the other parameters that characterize a stellar model , for adopted physical inputs .",
    "we point out that such a success can also be attributed to the unique derivation of ( @xmath44 ) thanks to state - of - the - art empirical mode identification techniques used in paperi and ii .",
    "a detailed nlte abundance analysis showed that the considered abundance values and thus the metallicity of @xmath1  oph correspond to the new solar mixture of asplund et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the cno abundances are much more consistent with the 3d values of asplund et al .",
    "( @xcite ) than with the 1d values of grevesse & sauval  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is generally the case for b - type stars ( morel et al .",
    "we found a mass @xmath45 8.2@xmath100.3 @xmath46 and a central hydrogen abundance @xmath47 0.38@xmath100.02 for the star .",
    "@xmath1  oph is the fifth @xmath0  cephei star for which the occurrence of core overshooting is deduced by seismic interpretation and is the target with the highest derived value ( @xmath48 = 0.44@xmath100.07 ) among them .",
    "however , it might be that the core overshooting parameter of previously modelled @xmath0  cephei stars is underestimated , as the case of illustrates it . for the modelling of this star , dupret et al .",
    "( @xcite ) adopted a value of @xmath49 larger than 0.016 in order to get the excitation of the modes .",
    "however , morel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) determined @xmath50@xmath100.0022 for .",
    "in addition , miglio , montalbn & dupret(@xcite ) recently showed that modes can be excited for @xmath51 if one uses the new solar abundances together with the op opacities , which was not the case in dupret et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . finally , considering a lower value of @xmath49 increases the @xmath48 of the star",
    "( see fig.3 in dupret et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we also showed that the asymmetry observed in the @xmath2 triplet can be well reproduced by taking into account the effects of rotation up to the second order . for the quintuplet , the agreement is however not as good . contrary to ( dupret et  al .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath16  eri ( pamyatnykh et  al .",
    "@xcite ) for which non - rigid rotation was proven , the observed rotational splitting of two modes for @xmath1  oph are still compatible with a rigid rotation model . in the near future",
    ", we can expect stronger constraints on the internal rotation of @xmath0  cephei stars from data collected from space missions ( e.g. most , corot ) . with the observation of rotational splitting of many modes having different probing kernels",
