    "the double well especially serves as a prototype system to study interference and tunneling in great detail .",
    "for instance the tunneling dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate has been observed to undergo josephson oscillations @xcite in which the population simply tunnels back and forth between the two wells .",

    "there it is possible to tune the interaction strength between the atoms by either using confinement induced resonances @xcite or magnetic feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "thus one can study the crossover from a weakly interacting to a strongly correlated regime .",
    "a particularly interesting case is the tonks - girardeau gas appearing in 1d in the limit of infinitely repulsive short - ranged interaction which has been recently observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "this gas of impenetrable boson is isomorphic with that of free fermions via the bose - fermi mapping @xcite and all the local properties are identical to the free fermion system .",
    "the gas still retains the bosonic permutation symmetry and so the non - local quantities differ from the fermionic case .",
    "theoretically the quantum dynamics in the weakly interacting case has been studied using the bose - hubbard model assuming the validity of a lowest band approximation @xcite .",
    "these studies illuminate relevant tunneling mechanisms and resonances . however , to capture the rich physics present in the stronger interaction regime we need to go beyond the bose - hubbard limit .",
    "moreover numerically exact calculations of the quantum dynamics for few bosons through a one - dimensional potential barrier @xcite or a bosonic josephson junction @xcite reveal deviations from the results obtained with mean - field calculations as well as establish a difference between the dynamics in attractive and repulsive bosonic systems @xcite .",
    "the crossover from the uncorrelated to fermionization regime has been investigated for few bosons @xcite and reveals a transition from rabi - oscillations to fragmented pair tunneling via a highly delayed tunneling process analogous to the self - trapping for condensates .",

    "we will demonstrate how spatially varying interaction strengths enrich the tunneling dynamics in the most fundamental case of a double - well .",
    "this has to be seen as a potential ingredient for more complex problems such as quantum transport in optical lattices .",

    "our goal is to study the bosonic quantum dynamics for weak to strong interactions in a numerically exact fashion .",

    "the correct bosonic permutation symmetry is obtained by symmetrization of the expansion coefficient @xmath22 .",

    "we first focus on the tunneling dynamics in a symmetric double - well with two bosons initially ( @xmath32 ) prepared in the left well .",
    "this is achieved by adding a tilt or a linear potential @xmath33 to the hamiltonian hence making the left well energetically favorable .",

    "our aim is to study the impact of the correlations between the bosons on the tunneling dynamics both with respect to the interaction strength as well as the spatial inhomogeneity .",

    "if we introduce a very small interaction @xmath46 ( inset ) the rabi oscillations give way to a beat pattern due to the existence of two very close frequencies .",
    "increasing the interaction strength further ( @xmath47 ) , we observe a suppression of tunneling with the maximum population in the right well @xmath48 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the inhomogeneous interaction which drives the tunneling off - resonance and should be carefully distinguished from the delayed pair - tunneling and self - trapping for the same @xmath37-value in the case of homogeneous interactions ( see below ) .",
    "the dynamics consists of a slow tunneling envelope with suppressed amplitude , which is modulated by a faster oscillation . for higher values of interaction strength @xmath49 ,",
    "the tunneling is completely suppressed .",
    "what remains is a fast oscillation with a tiny amplitude .",

    "the dynamics is characterized by two frequencies - one very close to the rabi frequency modulated by a faster oscillation . ideally at the fermionization limit @xmath52 , the system of hardcore bosons maps to a system of free fermions @xcite and all the local properties are identical .",
    "hence in this limit we would have complete two - mode single particle tunneling analogous to tunneling of two free fermions .",
    "before we move on to analyze in detail the above observations , let us comment briefly on the differences between the behavior observed in our setup and the case of a symmetric double - well with homogeneous interaction .",

    "the effects in the low interaction regime are equivalent to our set - up : the tilt has the same effect as an interaction asymmetry , namely it destroys resonant behavior thereby leading to a suppression of tunneling @xcite . nevertheless , our case is fundamentally different and this is evident in the strong interaction regime .",

    "for this we study the temporal evolution of the pair - probability or the probability of finding two particles in the same well defined by    @xmath161    and the three - particle - probability or the probability of finding all three particles in the same well defined by    @xmath162    in the case of @xmath126 , for homogeneous interaction @xmath75 at @xmath98 both @xmath163 and @xmath164 oscillate close to unity ( fig.[cap:3p_correlation ] ) .",

    "this resonance is broken and the energy of @xmath1 particles in the right well is higher than that in the left well resulting in the suppression of tunneling as seen before .",
    "now if we incorporate a tilt in the double well such that the left well is lifted and right well is pushed down energetically in exactly the right amount to make the localized @xmath1 particle energy levels resonant then we should expect a reemergence of tunneling .    to observe this we prepare the initial state with both particles in the right well @xmath167 and study the variation of the tunneling maximum @xmath168 with a tilt @xmath34 ( fig.[cap:2p_tilt](a ) ) incorporated into the hamiltonian as a linear term @xmath169 .",

    "we observe a sharp resonance at @xmath170 corresponding to the tilt which exactly balances the localized pair - state energy difference due to inhomogeneous interaction .",

    "the next maximum occurs when the tilt is large enough to make the localized pair state @xmath114 resonant with the state @xmath171 .",
    "this results in a broad tunneling maximum at @xmath172 corresponding to single - particle tunneling .    to confirm our analysis of the tunneling mechanism we look at the variation of maximum single particle probability @xmath165 with tilt ( fig.[cap:2p_tilt](b ) ) , defined as @xmath173 which gives the probability of having only one particle in a well .",

    "the tilt exactly balances the interaction inhomogeneity and the eigenstate is in form of the cat - state @xmath177 .",
    "this state is very sensitive to the tilt and a minute perturbation decouples them into the localized number - state resulting in a very sharp tunneling resonance .",
    "the ground - state , which is the @xmath171 state is insensitive to the tilt since this lowering of one particle and raising another particle keeps the state energetically unaffected within the linear regime .",
    "this state forms a broad ( anti)crossing with the lower excitedstate at @xmath172 forming the broad single - particle tunneling resonance seen in the dynamics .",
    "this behavior seen in the two - particle case can be expected in general for @xmath1 particles giving @xmath1 resonances corresponding to the avoided crossings encountered . in particular with increasing tilt , the successive resonances corresponds to a mechanism where one less particle tunnels compared to that of the previous one while the width of the resonances becomes progressively broader .",
    "we have investigated the double - well tunneling dynamics with inhomogeneous interaction .",
    "more specifically we modeled the system such that we have two different interaction strengths in the two wells .",
    "what we observe is that this inhomogeneity leads to a suppression of tunneling .",
    "the reason for this suppression can be attributed to the breaking up of the doublet structure in the energy spectrum leading to a decoupling of the eigenstates into the localized number - state .",
    "increasing the interaction to the fermionization limit leads to a reappearance of the tunneling .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the band splitting of the first two bands although the finiteness of the interaction strength and the presence of the interaction inhomogeneity leads to deviation from the ideal fermionic behavior . for a very pronounced interaction inhomogeneity for strong interactions ,",
