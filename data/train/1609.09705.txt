    "unlike what happens in ordinary fluids , vorticity in quantum fluids is constrained to vortex filaments of quantized circulation .",
    "recent experimental , numerical and theoretical studies @xcite have revealed the surprising result that quantum turbulence , despite the discrete nature of the vorticity , obeys the same kolmogorov scaling which is observed for homogeneous isotropic turbulence in ordinary fluids .",
    "more precisely , the superfluid kinetic energy spectrum scales as @xmath2 in the ` hydrodynamical ' range @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wavenumber , @xmath5 the size of the system , and @xmath6 the average distance between vortex lines .",
    "( what happens at length scales smaller than @xmath6 is very interesting - issues which are debated are the kelvin wave cascade and the possible existence of an energy flux bottleneck - but is outside the scope of this work . )",
    "evidence for kolmogorov scaling has been found in both bosonic @xmath0he and in fermionic @xmath1he - b , at both high temperatures ( where helium acquires a two - fluid nature due to the presence of the normal fluid ) and low temperatures .",
    "it has also been found , numerically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite , that , when averaged over scales larger than @xmath6 , the turbulent velocity components obey the same gaussian statistics of classical turbulence .",
    "the current  @xcite interpretation of these results is that quantum turbulence represents the ` skeleton ' of ordinary turbulence .",
    "however , there is also evidence for a very different spectral nature , in which the largest eddies are weak , most of the energy is contained in the intermediate scales , and the large wavenumber range has the @xmath7 dependence of isolated vortex lines .",
    "such features suggest a tangle of randomly oriented vortex lines whose velocity fields tend to cancel each other out",
    ". this second form of turbulence , named ` vinen ' or ` ultraquantum ' turbulence to distinguish it from the previous ` kolmogorov ' or ` quasiclassical ' turbulence @xcite , has been identified both numerically @xcite and experimentally ( in low temperature @xmath0he @xcite and in @xmath1he - b @xcite ) , and also ( numerically ) in high temperatures @xmath0he driven by a heat current @xcite ( thermal counterflow ) .",
    "the natural question is whether either vinen turbulence is some new form of disorder ( if so , why it has not been observed in classical turbulence ? ) or there are physical mechanisms which prevent the development of the classical kolmogorov spectrum and the energy cascade . in this report we shall argue that the latter is the solution of this important puzzle .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the kolmogorov phenomenology for classical turbulence ( undoubtedly , the content of this section is well known and can be found in every standard text on classical turbulence  @xcite ) .",
    "this will make our derivations of the conditions for / against the existence of the kinetic energy cascade and of the associated kolmogorov scaling in quantum turbulence more transparent .    in classical homogeneous and isotropic turbulence",
    "( away from the boundaries ) the richardson energy cascade takes place if there exists an interval of length scales ( known as the ` inertial range ' ) such that , at every scale @xmath8 within this range , the dissipation time @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the kinematic viscosity ) is much longer than the eddie turnover time @xmath11 : @xmath12 with the velocity at the length scale @xmath8 given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy dissipation rate and @xmath15 the energy per unit mass ( we assume that the fluid has constant density ) .    condition  ( [ eq : tau ] ) for the existence of the cascade can be reformulated as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the scale - by - scale reynolds number .",
    "inequality  ( [ eq : tau ] ) becomes invalid at the kolmogorov length scale , @xmath18 , where , by definition , @xmath19 ( that is , viscous and inertial forces are comparable ) .",
    "the energy spectrum , @xmath20 , is defined by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the volume . within the inertial range , the kolmogorov scaling of the energy spectrum",
    "is obtained assuming that @xmath20 depends only on @xmath23 and @xmath4 .",
    "simple dimensional analysis then yields the famous result that , within the inertial range @xmath24 , the energy spectrum is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "we now turn to quantum turbulence . unlike classical turbulence , where vorticity is continuous and eddies have arbitrary shape and strength , quantum turbulence consists of individual vortex lines .",
    "each vortex line carries one quantum of circulation @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is planck s constant and @xmath29 the mass of the relevant boson ( one atom for @xmath0he , one cooper pair for @xmath1he - b ) .    in analogy with classical turbulence , we are interested in the existence of a richardson energy cascade in the hydrodynamic range @xmath30 , which is the regime of vortices interacting with each other ; we are not interested in the @xmath31 regime of isolated vortex lines ( an important but different physical problem with no direct relation to classical fluid dynamics ) .",
    "we , therefore , consider the length scales @xmath8 such that @xmath32 where the mean intervortex distance , @xmath6 can be inferred from the observed vortex line density @xmath33 , defined as the total length of vortex lines per unit volume , as @xmath34 however , in the zero - temperature limit this relation holds only for the smoothed line density ; owing to the presence of high frequency kelvin waves undamped by the mutual friction , in the zero - temperature limit the actual vortex line density exceeds the smoothed line density , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details which will also be discussed below in the penultimate section of this report .",
    "similar to the kolmogorov phenomenology for classical turbulence , the conditions for existence of the richardson cascade and , therefore , the @xmath35 kolmogorov scaling of the superfluid kinetic energy spectrum , can be obtained by comparing the time scale of dissipation with the turnover time of the macroscopic eddies . in the next two sections",
    "we shall make this comparison ( distinguishing between high temperature and low temperature regimes ) for turbulent states which , anomalously , do not follow the kolmogorov scaling .    for the sake of brevity , we shall call _ non - cascading _ the turbulence which does not exhibit scale - by - scale energy transfer . thus , for a homogeneous isotropic system , the energy spectrum does not scale as @xmath35 at large wavenumbers @xmath4 ; a noticeable feature of such non - cascading turbulence is that kinetic energy is concentrated at some intermediate wavenumbers , giving the spectrum @xmath20 the shape of a ` bump ' followed by @xmath7 behaviour at large @xmath4 .",
    "we start with quantum turbulence at high temperatures such that @xmath36 for @xmath0he , where @xmath37 is the superfluid transition temperature , or @xmath38 for @xmath1he - b , where @xmath39 is the critical temperature of the superfluid transition . at high temperatures",
    "the dissipation is caused by the mutual friction between the normal fluid and superfluid vortices .",
    "an anomalous , non - cascading superfluid energy spectrum has been predicted @xcite for @xmath0he counterflow and for grid turbulence in @xmath1he - b in the presence of very viscous , stationary normal fluid  @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that , in the case where the normal fluid is either stationary or non - turbulent , the strong mutual friction , which is dissipative at all length scales , prevents the emergence of the inertial range and the @xmath40 energy spectrum in the superfluid component .",
    "our aim here is to reveal the physical mechanism which prevents the formation of the classical kolmogorov spectrum .    to find the timescale associated with the mutual friction , we develop the following simple macroscopic model of thermal counterflow in @xmath0he .",
    "the coarse - grained ( that is , averaged over a scale much larger than the intervortex distance ) superfluid and normal fluid velocities , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , are governed by the equations  @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the pressure , @xmath45 the entropy , @xmath46 the temperature , @xmath47 and @xmath48 the superfluid and normal fluid densities , @xmath49 the total density , @xmath50 the viscosity , and @xmath51 the convective derivative . the mutual friction force per unit volume is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the temperature - dependent mutual friction coefficient ( for @xmath0he its values , obtained from the counterflow measurements , are tabulated in ref .",
    "the quantum of circulation is @xmath54 .",
    "we consider for simplicity steady one - dimensional flow along the @xmath55-direction of a long channel which is closed at one end and open to the helium bath at the other end . at the closed end ,",
    "an electrical resistor dissipates a given heat flux @xmath56 , which is carried away by the normal fluid at the velocity @xmath57 .",
    "superfluid flows in the opposite direction to maintain the condition of zero mass flux , @xmath58 . in this way a relative motion ( counterflow ) @xmath59 is set up beween the normal fluid and the superfluid , which is proportional to the applied heat flux , @xmath60 .",
    "the importance of this flow configuration can not be understated , as it is used to study the exceptional heat conducting properties of liquid helium as a coolant in engineering applications . provided that @xmath61 exceeds a small critical value ,",
    "the superfluid becomes turbulent , and a tangle of vortex lines fills the channel with vortex line density @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that @xmath61 is not so large that the normal fluid becomes turbulent .",
    "let @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 be the values of superfluid velocity , normal fluid velocity and vortex line density , respectively , in the steady - state regime at given temperature @xmath46 and heat flux @xmath65 .    to simplify the problem and to highlight the role of the friction",

    ", we assume that the velocity of the normal fluid remains constant , and linearize the friction , neglecting fluctuations of @xmath33 , @xmath46 and @xmath44 , so that @xmath75 . after subtracting the steady state",
    ", the superfluid equation reduces to @xmath76 having assumed that the channel is long , we change to the moving reference frame @xmath77 in which the equation for the superfluid velocity fluctuations becomes @xmath78 where the friction timescale is @xmath79    in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : vs - tau ] ) we have considered a region of the fluid where the vortex line density , @xmath33 is essentially constant apart from small fluctuations which cause fluctuations of the friction which are much quicker than the evolution of @xmath72 . in this approximation",
    "we can assume that @xmath33 is constant , so the equation for @xmath72 is linear , and , fourier trasforming , we have @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the fourier component of the superfluid velocity @xmath82 at time @xmath83 and wavenumber @xmath84 .",
    "the important assumption is that @xmath85 does not depend on @xmath4 , so that the linear equation for the velocity @xmath72 in physical space becomes a linear equation for the fourier component of the velocity @xmath86 .",
    "there are two conditions for the existence of the cascade .",
    "the first , given above by inequality  ( [ eq : rggl ] ) , is that the scale @xmath8 must be larger than the intervortex spacing , that is to say we are in the hydrodynamic regime of many vortices , not in the regime of isolated vortex lines .",

    "( [ eq : dissipation ] ) as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the rms of the superfluid velocity fluctuations .",
    "we also make the assumption that the average amplitude of the fluctuations , @xmath92 is only a fraction of the mean superflow , @xmath93 with @xmath94 or less .    in the counterflow produced by a strong heat current such that the normal fluid is highly turbulent , the turbulent intencity in the latter was recently measured  @xcite by means of the technique using triplet - state he@xmath95 molecular tracers .",
    "the fluctuations in the normal fluid were found to be about 0.25 of the normal fluid s mean velocity .",
    "the fluctuations in the superfluid have not been measured , but the same level of turbulence intencity can be anticipated . however , in the regime where the normal fluid is laminar or stationary , as in the case considered in the current work , velocity fluctuations in the superfluid component should be much smaller .    since @xmath96 , combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : eps - rms ] ) we write criteria ( [ eq : rggl ] ) and ( [ eq : f ] ) in the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 for temperatures between 1.5 and @xmath99 typical of the counterflow , @xmath100 is between 0.1 and 0.75 and @xmath53 varies from 0.074 to 0.5 @xcite , while @xmath69 is of the order of @xmath101 @xcite , so that @xmath102 is of the order unity and it is impossible to satisfy simultaneously both conditions in inequalities ( [ eq : conditions ] ) .",
    "it follows , then , that for the values of parameters typical of the thermal counterflow the kolmogorov scaling of the energy spectrum should not be expected .",
    "( note that this conclusion has been obtained assuming that the normal fluid velocity is constant .",
    "this assumption is violated , so that our model is no longer valid , if the normal fluid itself becomes turbulent , as in the counterflow at a sufficiently large heat current . in this case , owing to the mutual friction between the normal fluid and quantized vortices , the superfluid energy spectrum acquires the @xmath35 kolmogorov scaling . )    a typical superfluid kinetic energy spectrum obtained from our numerical simulation of the counterflow turbulence is shown in figure  [ fig : counterflow ] .",

    "the hydrodynamical range is from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",

    "the parameters are : temperature @xmath106 , counterflow velocity @xmath107 , friction coefficient @xmath108 , vortex line density @xmath109 corresponding to @xmath110 , in good agreement with ref .  @xcite . the calculation is performed in a cubic periodic domain of size @xmath111 ; numerical discretization along the vortex lines is @xmath112 .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : counterflow ] , the energy spectrum has a broad peak at intermediate wave numbers , without much energy at the largest scales ( smallest @xmath4 ) . at large @xmath4",
    ", the spectrum follows the typical @xmath7 scaling of smooth isolated vortex lines , not kolmogorov s @xmath35 scaling .",
    "in fact , using the parameters of the simulation , inequality  ( [ eq : conditions ] ) becomes @xmath113 , which can not be satisfied .",
    "since the spectrum of an isolated vortex line scales as @xmath7 , the observation of @xmath114 in a turbulent tangle of vortex lines suggests that far - field effects cancel each other out , in other words that the vortex lines are randomly oriented , and that the only length scale of the turbulence is @xmath6 .",
    "a similar argument based on the comparison between the time scale of friction with the turnover time of eddies was used to justify the absence of the kolmogorov energy spectrum in @xmath1he - b grid turbulence in the presence of the stationary normal fluid  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of the @xmath35 spectrum in @xmath0he coflows was clearly demonstrated by the experimental measurements  @xcite and various numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "there is strong experimental evidence in both @xmath0he and @xmath1he - b for the existence of kolmogorov energy spectra at temperatures so low that the normal fluid , hence the friction , is negligible .",
    "this evidence is the observed decay law of the vortex line density , @xmath115 , which can be related to an underlying kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "numerical simulations performed using the gross - pitaevskii equation and the vortex filament model confirmed this result by directly measuring the energy spectra .",
    "however , there is also experimental and numerical evidence for a different turbulent regime in which the kolmogorov spectrum is absent and the resulting decay of turbulence is @xmath116 . as for the high temperature regime discussed in the previous section , the existence of this second regime ( called _ vinen _ , or _",
    "ultraquantum _ turbulence in the literature to distinguish it from the _ quasiclassical _ kolmogorov regime ) , presents us with a puzzle .",
    "our aim is to develop a model which would yield conditions necessary for emergence of the quasiclassical quantum turbulence at very low temperatures such that the presemce of the normal fluid can be neglected .",
    "a model developed below is based on the experiments reported in refs .",
    "@xcite in which turbulence was generated by injecting a jet of negative ions ( electrons in a bubble state ) . at low temperatures each injected electron dresses itself into a quantized vortex ring .",
    "the rings then collide and reconnect to produce a vortex tangle which gradually fills the experimental cell .",
    "a regime of quantum turbulence was then identified by the scaling with time of the decay of vortex line density after the ion injection has stopped .",
    "numerical analysis of the decay of quasiclassical and ultraquantum regimes of turbulence can be found in our paper  @xcite . in refs .  @xcite it was found that the regime of turbulence , generated by injection of the ion jet , depends on a duration , @xmath117 of the ion injection : the ultraquantum regime was generated when the duration of injection was relatively short , and",
    "the quasiclassical regime was observed if the injection time was longer .",
    "our model is outlined in the following three paragraphs .",
    "assume that vortex rings ( whose sizes are narrowly distributed around some mean value ) are injected into the experimental cell filled with @xmath0he at very low temperature .",
    "the rings collide and reconnect , gradually forming the vortex tangle .",
    "part of the energy injected by vortex rings is fed into the kelvin waves and ultimately dissipated by the phonon radiation .",
    "the vortex line density , @xmath33 grows until , at time @xmath118 , called below the `` saturation '' time , the total energy input by injected rings balances the total energy fed into the kelvin waves . at this time",
    "the growth of the line density stops and thereafter the tangle is in the statistically steady state with the time - averaged vortex line density @xmath119 until time @xmath120 when the injection stops and the tangle decays .    the quasiclassical regime of quantum turbulence may be generated in the case where there exists a mechanism of the three - dimensional inverse energy transfer from the scales at which the energy is injected ( presumably , the scale of a single vortex ring ) to larger scales which substantially exceed the mean intervortex distance in the created vortex tangle . as we argued in our earlier papers  @xcite , such a mechanism can be provided by anisotropy which favours reconnections of loops of the same polarity .",
    "furthemore , in the cited papers we demonstrated by direct numerical simulation a generation of the kolmogorov @xmath35 energy spectrum resulting from the process of rings injection , thus mimicking the experiments  @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms of reconnections of injected quantized vortex rings , and of generation of quasiclassical , large - scale velocity fluctuations was further investigated , theoretically and experimentally , in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the authors of cited work favoured the view that the process of rings reconnections , resulting in creation of the coarse - grained velocity field on the quasiclassical scales , is , in fact , the three - dimensional inverse cascade . however , whether this inverse energy transfer is an inverse cascade or not is irrelevant for the purpose of the current study .    in the process of rings injection",
    "the kolmogorov spectrum gradually grows through the wavenumber space to smaller wavenumbers eventually filling , at some time @xmath121 , the whole available interval of wavenumbers from @xmath122 to @xmath123 , where @xmath5 is the size of the experimental cell ( or the integral scale of the fully developed quasiclassical turbulence ) .",
    "if the injection of rings stops at time @xmath124 , the following decay of the line density will be that typical of the quasiclassical turbulence and scale with time as @xmath125 . had the injection been stopped some time before @xmath126 , the inverse energy transfer would not have enough time to develop a full kolmogorov spectrum spanning all available lengthscales , in which case the vortex tangle would still be ultraquantum and decay , after the injection has stopped , as @xmath127 .",
    "note that our aim is to find conditions necessary for emergence of the quasiclassical regime which is associated with motion at scales larger than the intervortex distance .",
    "for such a motion the rate at which the energy is fed into the kelvin waves plays a rle of the dissipation rate , and the details of dissipation by phonon emission as well as the possibility of the much debated bottleneck in the energy flux between the macroscopic motion and the kelvin wave cascade are irrelevant .",
    "the energy of an isolated quantized vortex ring of radius @xmath128 is  @xcite @xmath129 where the function @xmath130 is @xmath131 @xmath132 is the vortex core radius which is of the order of coherence length .",
    "we assume here that all injected rings are of the same radius , as practically was the case in the experiments  @xcite .",
    "( in fact , the sizes of the rings are narrowly distributed around some value of the radius .",
    "this was taken into account in our earlier numerical studies  @xcite , but is irrelevant for the purpose of the model considered below . )    assuming that the frequency of rings injection is @xmath133 , the rate of energy input , per unit mass , can be estimated as @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the volume of cubic experimental cell , and @xmath136 is the probability of the vortex ring to propagate through the vortex tangle without collisions with other vortex lines .",
    "this probability , which depends on the current vortex line density , @xmath137 and the size of experimental cell , @xmath5 was investigated in detail in ref .",
    "the probability @xmath44 is close to unity when the tangle is still very dilute but decreases exponentially with both the vortex line density and the size of experimental cell . for the values of parameters typical of the experiment  @xcite ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) ,",
    "the probability @xmath44 becomes small ( less than 0.25 ) already for @xmath140 , and negligible when the tangle reaches the saturated , statistically steady state with @xmath33 of the order @xmath141 .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume below that @xmath142 so that all injected rings contribute to the growth of the line density .",
    "( note that in the conditions of the cited experiment the probability @xmath44 is not unity even at the very early stages of tangle s formation as the rings are injected in a narrow beam so that collisions between rings of slightly different radii are not infrequent .",

    "moreover , it will also be shown below that time @xmath121 required for generation of quasiclassical turbulence is independent of @xmath118 .",
    "we will also assume that at each moment of time the vortex tangle occupies the whole experimental volume .",
    "although there is some evidence that at the early stages of evolution the tangle occupies only part of the experimental volume , see e.g. fig .  1 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the simplifying assumptions made above will suffice for the order - of - magnitude estimates of @xmath121 .",

    "in the zero - temperature quantum turbulence the vortex reconnections generate the kelvin waves which lead to an increase of the _ actual _ ( as opposed to the _ smoothed _ ) vortex line density , @xmath33 , for which the relation  ( [ eq : kwflux ] ) still holds in the form @xmath147 , but with @xmath148 .",

    "however , the recent work  @xcite gives convincing arguments that the value of @xmath146 is independent of the energy spectrum and , therefore , should be the same for both the quasiclassical and the ultraquantum regimes .",

    "firstly , reconnection of the vortex loop , whose line length is @xmath157 , with another vortex ring or with a vortex line within the tangle does not , in general , increase the tangle s total _ smoothed _ line length by @xmath158 as some of the length may be `` lost '' to the kelvin waves ( for example , a merger of two rings of the same radius @xmath128 results in the ring whose smoothed lengths corresponds to a radius of only about @xmath159 ) .",

    "the reason is that even at temperature as low as 0.7  k , such that the normal fluid fraction is only @xmath224 and the mutual friction coefficient @xmath53 is of the order of @xmath225 , the vortex rings of radius @xmath226 can not be treated as ballistic . indeed , at this temperature such rings decay on a distance @xmath227 which is much smaller than the size of the experimental cell .",

    "clearly , our simple model , which assumes both ballistic propagation of rings and the spatial uniformity of the tangle , does not capture these phenomena .",

    "figure  [ fig : counterflow ] . on the other hand",
    ", our simulation for a longer duration of injection clearly shows that in this case the kolmogorov spectrum is formed , see the top curve of figure  [ fig : quasi - ultra ] .",
    "based on estimates for the effective dissipation rate in quantum turbulence considered at the hydrodynamic scales , that is in the range of scales corresponding to many vortices rather than individual vortex lines , we have obtained conditions necessary for existence of the kinetic energy cascade in the superfluid component and , hence , of the @xmath35 scaling of the superfluid s kinetic energy spectrum . the phenomenological approach which we have developed has enabled us to explain why , at finite temperatures , the kolmogorov energy spectrum can not be observed in @xmath0he counterflows and @xmath1he - b flows in the presence of stationary normal fluid .",
    "we have then extended our approach to consider generation of @xmath0he quantum turbulence at very low temperatures .",
    "we have considered a tangle of quantized vortices generated , as in the experiments  @xcite , by a beam of electrons injected , in the bubble state , into helium at temperatures significantly lower than @xmath239 . at the considered scales of many vortices the rle of the effective dissipation rate",
    "is played by the rate at which the energy is fed into the kelvin waves .",
    "having calculated the time required for the inverse energy transfer to form the kolmogorov energy spectrum for all available `` quasiclassical '' wavenumbers ( from that corresponding to the size of experimental volume to the wavenumber corresponding to the intervortex distance @xmath6 ) , we estimated the durations of injection required to generate the quasiclassical regime of quantum turbulence at scales larger than @xmath6 .",
    "the calculated durations are consistent with those observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the regimes of quantum turbulence which have been observed at both high and low temperatures and which are characterized by the spectral nature in which the larges eddies are weak , most of the energy is contained at the intermediate scales , and the fully developed energy cascade is absent , can be understood on the ground of simple large - scale quasiclassical ( `` hydrodynamical '' ) considerations .",
