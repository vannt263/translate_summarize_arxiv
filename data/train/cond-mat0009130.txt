    "the reader is also reminded that the classical picture can be qualitatively wrong , at the temperatures of interest , which are well below the quantum spinwave energies .",
    "for example , the quantum pyrochlore lattice is seen to be _ less _ degenerate than the kagom case , in contrast to classical results ; and the effective interactions favoring collinear / coplanar and other forms of order are much more powerful in the quantum case .",
    "the rest of the paper concerns the effects of dilution .",
    "does it produce a spin glass , or generate an effective hamiltonian favoring long - range order , or preserve the exceptional degeneracy of the pure lattice ?",

    "`` lattices analogous to the kagom '' meant , more precisely , the _ bisimplex _ lattices : those derived from a bipartite network by placing a spin at each bond midpoint , so that each spin belongs to two _ simplices_. ( my `` simplex '' is a synonym for `` unit '' as used by moessner _",

    "each term in ( [ eq - hhlsq ] ) is satisfied ( in zero field ) whenever @xmath20 . then each undiluted bisimplex lattice is completely _ unfrustrated _ from the simplex viewpoint , since it can be shown ( by example ) that every simplex _ can _ attain this minimum at the same time .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the classical ground state manifold ( for @xmath22 ) ; it is massively degenerate on every bisimplex lattice .",
    "our goal is to discover how the system breaks symmetry and orders ( if it does ) . we assume provisionally that , for sufficiently large @xmath0",

    "( this clearly fails if the fluctuations about a classical ground state are as big as the distance to the next one , or if the system tunnels so freely between dressed classical states that the correct wavefunction is a superposition . )",
    "this assumption directly gives us the ordering pattern in a simple ( e.g. triangular lattice ) heisenberg antiferromagnet , where the classical ground state is unique ( modulo symmetries ) .",
    "but commonly , the classical ground states have nontrivial degeneracies , so that every ground state has a different manifold of possible small spin deviations and consequently a different zero - point energy .",
    "presumably , the true quantum ground state should be constructed around the particular ( ordered ! ) classical ground state which has the lowest zero - point energy .",

    "( [ eq - hbiq ] ) should be replaced by a different functional form to approximately represent @xmath30 , because ( i ) the criterion for favored states is that the spins are _ coplanar _ ; ( ii ) the true function @xmath38 , linear  @xcite rather than quadratic in the deviations @xmath39 .    more fundamentally , the harmonic approach fails in the kagom case because it does not fully break the degeneracy .",
    "every coplanar state has exactly the same harmonic - order hamiltonian , if written using as coordinates at each site ( i ) the @xmath40 ( out - of - plane ) spin deviation and ( ii ) the rotation angle around the @xmath40 axis .",
    "the source of this , mathematically , is that @xmath41 takes the same value ( here @xmath42 ) for every nearest - neighbor pair , in every favored ground state .",
    "consquently , on a bisimplex lattice with only triangles , _ i.e. , _ the kagom or hyperkagom lattices , @xmath43 has exactly the same value for _ every _ coplanar state @xmath44 .",
    "the number of such states is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of unit cells .    to resolve the surviving degeneracy among favored ground states , we need a second effective hamiltonian @xmath47 , obtained from some sort of self - consistent theory that takes account of anharmonic spin - wave interactions  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath33 is discrete , @xmath48 is parametrized by discrete - spin variables : in the kagom case , the `` chiralities '' @xmath49 defined from the spins on each plaquette  @xcite .",
    "our own approximation  @xcite gave ( \\ { _ } ) = - _ ( r _ ) _ _ , which has the form of an antiferromagnetic ising hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice , and is defined for _ every _ favored ground state @xmath44 .",
    "the energy scale  @xcite is certainly @xmath50 , i.e. down by only a factor @xmath51 from the scale of the harmonic term @xmath30 .    in the pyrochlore case ,",
    "( [ eq - hbiq ] ) is also too crude : here the favored ground states @xmath44 _ are _ the collinear ones , but their harmonic energies @xmath52 are nondegenerate since different collinear states have different patterns of @xmath53 .",
    "it turns out that the special states that minimize @xmath32 are still infinite in number , but only as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the system s diameter  @xcite ; the kagom - sandwich lattice seems to behave similarly .",
    "thus , in the quantum case , the pyrochlore and sandwich lattices show _ more _ ordering tendency than the kagom lattice ( at harmonic order ) , whereas in the classical case it is the other way around  @xcite .",
    "although large @xmath0 justifies visualizing each spin as a fixed - length vector , it does _ not _ justify a purely classical simulation of the system .",
    "the reason is that the interesting phenomena occur when @xmath56 , the scale of @xmath30 .",
    "thus thermal effects are only a small correction to the quantum effects .",
    "i believe there is an easy fix : a classical monte carlo simulation using a hamiltonian which includes ( an approximation of ) @xmath30 and @xmath48 ought to give valid physical results .    for a specific example , consider scgo with @xmath57 and a curie - weiss constant  @xcite of @xmath58 , hence @xmath59 .",
    "then , in a kagom lattice , the effective energy of coplanarity would be @xmath60 per spin along a straight `` spin fold ''  @xcite ; if we presume this also applies to the shortest rotatable loop of six sites , we get a barrier of @xmath61 ( alternatively @xmath62 from app .",
    "b of ref .  ) .",
    "that is vastly larger than the analogous free energy barrier in a classical system , at the scgo freezing temperature @xmath63 . again , in a pyrochlore lattice with the same coupling @xmath64 , the coefficient in ( [ eq - hbiq ] ) comes out to @xmath65 per nearest - neighbor bond .",
    "that ought to induce a transition to long - range - ordered collinearity at a temperature of order @xmath66 , which would nt happen at any temperature in a classical system  @xcite .",
    "i now turn to the longer part of this paper : what effect(s ) does dilution have on a highly frustrated system , specifically on a bisimplex - lattice antiferromagnet ? can it be represented by an effective hamiltonian ? or can it turn an ordered system into a spin glass ?",
    "the answers are `` yes '' for the `` ordinary '' antiferromagnets , which are reviewed in this section ( in three regimes ) . the answers are different for highly frustrated magnets ( later sections ) .    starting with this section",

    "the total magnetization does not cancel exactly , since the moment on the even or odd sublattice has @xmath70 statistical fluctuations .",

    "often , depending on how a defect s local symmetry relates to that of the ground - state manifold @xmath21 , each defect may prefer a particular ground state , out of the subspace @xmath33 favored by @xmath78 . in that case",

    "disorder wins if it is sufficiently strong or the dimension is low enough .",
    "the resulting state is a spin glass , in the sense that it lacks long - range correlations and has barriers , but has not been proven to be the same phase as a @xmath79 spin glass  @xcite .",
    "now return to the same triangular lattice , but with strong dilution so that @xmath68 is just above @xmath13 .",
    "it is well known that , near percolation , the typical connection between two sites ( if any ) is tenuous , and order is propagated over one - dimensional chains of sites , which are multiply - connected at occasional places . at @xmath67 ,",
    "the spin directions alternate along such a chain , so it constrains the relative orientation of the endpoint spins to be parallel or antiparallel , depending on whether the number of bonds connecting them is even or odd .",

    "dilution affects a bisimplex lattice quite differently than an ordinary frustrated lattice : simulations find that essentially _ every simplex remains satisfied _ , i.e. @xmath20 , even for strong dilution .",

    "the simplex - satisfaction concept also encompasses bond - randomness effects ( see start of sec .",

    "if we let @xmath117 include the entire system , there is no boundary term and the total `` charge '' ( left - hand side of ( [ eq - qthm ] ) ) must be zero .",
