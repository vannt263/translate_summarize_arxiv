    "there has been a great effort in deriving models of elementary particle physics from string theory .",
    "promising models have arisen from intersecting d - branes in type iib string theory , f - theory , calabi - yau and orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string . in particular ,",
    "heterotic orbifolds have been extensively studied and successful models reproducing several features of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( the mssm ) have been found  @xcite . unfortunately , contact between all these different constructions and particle phenomenology requires a full understanding of the details of the vacua that each model offers .",
    "these details are associated with the dynamics of the _ moduli _ fields that describe all geometrical features of the particular compactification .",
    "for instance , the masses of quarks and leptons as well as the dynamics of supersymmetry breakdown depend on the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the moduli , which are arbitrary at tree level in many string constructions .",
    "therefore , in order to achieve a prediction from string theory and simultaneously to avoid severe cosmological constraints , a mechanism that fixes the vevs of the moduli and gives them large masses is needed .",
    "this mechanism is usually called _ moduli fixing _ or",
    "_ stabilization_.    besides constructions that potentially explain particle physics , moduli stabilization has been independently studied in several scenarios . in type iib string theory",
    ", it has been shown that conjugating fluxes , nonperturbative effects and/or @xmath0 corrections could yield stable vacua  @xcite .",
    "there has also been some progress in fixing khler and complex structure moduli in heterotic compactifications on calabi - yau  @xcite and ( generalized ) half - flat  @xcite manifolds . in heterotic orbifold compactifications",
    "@xcite , which is the focus of the present note , it is frequently argued that the absence of fluxes ( other than the ns flux ) can render much more difficult if not impossible the search for a stable vacuum .",
    "however , it is known that the inherent target space modular symmetries  @xcite together with nonperturbative effects such as gaugino condensation and string worldsheet instantons can provide a scalar potential with metastable minima , at least in toy models  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present note is to review the main results of  @xcite .",
    "we go beyond the usual claims and tackle explicitly the problem of moduli fixing in mssm candidates arising from heterotic orbifolds .",
    "we base our study on a subset of the @xmath1 realistic 6ii orbifold models of the minilandscape  @xcite , in which gaugino condensation can successfully yield an acceptable scale of supersymmetry breakdown  @xcite .",
    "the main phenomenological properties of these models shall be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : samplemodel ] , where the details of a sample model are given .",
    "we consider all bulk moduli fields , i.e. the dilaton @xmath2 and those fields describing the deformations in size @xmath3 and shape @xmath4 of the compact dimensions .",
    "we analyze the 4d effective action of these models , which is well understood  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the scalar potential consists of various computable , perturbative and nonperturbative contributions , which , as it turns out , lift all bulk moduli directions .",
    "this will be the topic of sec .",
    "[ sec : modulifixing ] .",
    "once moduli stabilization is achieved in these setups , it results immediate to explore some cosmological consequences .",
    "we speculate in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosmology ] that inflation might emerge readily , since some of the moduli directions exhibit very small curvature , rendering the associated fields natural inflaton / curvaton candidates .    in the following , we shall work in planck units , specifically we set @xmath5 .",
    "the so - called minilandscape is perhaps the most fertile search of string - derived mssm candidates .",
    "there have been found about 300 models with the exact spectrum of the mssm ( or nmssm  @xcite ) and no exotics at low energies . besides",
    ", these models exhibit other appealing properties : approximate gauge coupling unification  @xcite , see - saw neutrino masses  @xcite , predominantly tev gravitino mass  @xcite , gauge - top unification  @xcite , r - symmetries  @xcite and other discrete symmetries  @xcite that prevent rapid proton decay and other lepton / baryon - number violating processes .",

    "the 6d space is chosen to be the torus @xmath6 spanned by the roots @xmath7 of the lie algebra g@xmath8@xmath93@xmath94 .",
    "the smaller / blue arrows denote the noncontractible loops that are embedded as nontrivial wilson lines @xmath10 in the gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "modding out a 6 symmetry in this geometry leaves the points @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 untouched.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the minilandscape is based on 6ii orbifold compactifications of the 8@xmath98 heterotic string .",
    "the 6d torus is chosen to be the product of three 2-tori , @xmath6 , which are spanned by the simple roots of the lie algebra g@xmath8@xmath93@xmath94 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : z6iigeometry ] . in this basis",
    ", the action of the 6ii symmetry acts identifying the points related by a rotation ( or repeated rotations ) by @xmath14 in the g@xmath15 2-torus , by @xmath16 in the 3 2-torus , and reflection(s ) through the origin in the last 2-torus .",
    "the special points that are left unaffected by this identification , depicted by @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : z6iigeometry ] , are called fixed points and are of crucial relevance in the minilandscape , as we shall see shortly .",
    "the intrinsic modular invariance of the heterotic string demands the orbifold action to be embedded in the gauge degrees of freedom , producing thereby the breakdown of the original 8@xmath98 gauge group to a subgroup thereof , which in the minilandscape models takes the generic form @xmath17 .",
    "all standard model ( sm ) fields are uncharged under the nonabelian gauge factor @xmath18 , but some other  hidden \" fields form nontrivial representations under this group .",
    "the guiding principle of the minilandscape search is local grand unification  @xcite , which refers to the possibility that certain fixed points of an orbifold be endowed with the gauge symmetry of a grand unified theory ( gut ) like 5 or @xmath19 , while the 4d gauge group be the one of the sm .",
    "this indeed happens in the small moduli - space region of the minilandscape and leads to scenarios that preserve the appealing features of guts such as gauge coupling unification while solving their common phenomenological drawbacks such as problematic quark / lepton mass relations .",
    "the crucial advantage is that matter fields living at points endowed e.g. with an @xmath19 local symmetry can transform as * 16 * -plets locally .",
    "since the * 16 * spinor of @xmath19 contains a sm family of quarks and leptons , if ideally there were three of such special local guts , one would find a geometric origin of the three sm generations .",
    "moreover , the sm higgs doublets need not arise from such local guts , but from the bulk or a fixed point with no local gut .",
    "therefore , no doublet - triplet splitting must be enforced in this situation .",
    "unfortunately , the scenario with three degenerate sm families coming from local guts is not favored by orbifold constructions  @xcite . instead , only two generations arise from equivalent local @xmath19 guts ( see the encircled / red @xmath11 in fig .  [",
    "fig : z6iigeometry ] ) , what is not necessarily bad news , for we might prefer a setting in which a distinction between the two lightest and the heaviest sm generation emerges naturally .",

    "this situation leads to gaugino condensation in this sector , which renders the scale of supersymmetry breakdown as low as @xmath62 tev  @xcite , not far from the admissible / expected value .    in the absence of matter parity in this model ,",
    "some of the sm singlets ( those without vevs ) can be considered right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we have verified that they become massive when the exotics decouple , i.e. they get masses of order @xmath63 too .",
    "this large right - handed neutrino mass enables the see - saw mechanism to produce left - handed neutrino masses of order @xmath64 ev , as suggested by neutrino - oscillation probes  @xcite .    as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : spectrum ] , this model has five bulk moduli .",
    "the dilaton @xmath2 arising from the supergravity multiplet , and four deformation parameters .",
    "the latter are obtained from demanding invariance of the metric @xmath65 under the 6ii orbifold action .",
    "the free parameters in this case are the `` radius '' of the cycle @xmath66 in the g@xmath15 torus , @xmath67 in the 3 torus , and the cycle radii and angle of the last torus , i.e. the magnitude of @xmath68 and @xmath69 and the angle between them .",
    "these deformations are usually collected in three khler moduli @xmath70 for the radii of each of the tori , and a complex structure modulus @xmath71 for the angle in the last torus .    as a last remark",
    ", we would like to mention that this model possesses some useful symmetries .",
    "like many minilandscape models , it presents an 2 family symmetry  @xcite which is the result of the vertical symmetry between the fixed points of the last torus ( see e.g. the encircled / red @xmath11 in fig .  [",
    "fig : z6iigeometry ] ) .",
    "this symmetry is particularly useful for particle phenomenology , as it could shed light on the structure of the quark and lepton mass matrices . besides",
    ", all orbifold models exhibit target - space modular symmetries  @xcite that act as discrete transformations on the moduli , winding numbers and momenta . in the present model , they are @xmath72_{t}{\\ensuremath{\\times}}[\\gamma^0(4)]_u$ ] transforming the three khler @xmath3 and one complex structure @xmath71 moduli , respectively .",
    "these discrete transformations do not only ensure ( and help to verify ) the consistency of the theory , but are a great tool for moduli fixing , as we shall see .",
    "in order to stabilize the moduli , a full knowledge of the effective supergravity theory is required . remarkably , heterotic orbifold compactifications are the only scenario in which all relevant quantities can be computed explicitly from string theory .",
    "perturbatively , the effective theory receives contributions from nonvanishing couplings between matter states that can be found by applying the so - called selection rules  @xcite , based on the string symmetries that are left unbroken by the orbifold action .",
    "the coupling strengths have been worked out using conformal field theory techniques  @xcite finding that they are exponentially suppressed by the khler moduli .",
    "perturbative @xmath0 corrections do not contribute to the tree - level superpotential  @xcite . at nonperturbative level ,",
    "the main contribution to the effective theory comes from gaugino condensation , which is affected by threshold corrections due to the decoupling of exotic matter and string excitations  @xcite .    to simplify somewhat our discussion",
    ", we adopt the following assumptions :    * all ( vectorlike ) exotics decouple consistently with supersymmetry at a unique scale @xmath60 , such that @xmath73 ; * at some scale close to @xmath60 , the charged hidden matter @xmath74 are decoupled too , yielding hidden - sector gaugino condensation at the scale @xmath75 ; * nonrenormalizable couplings among matter fields are negligible ; * the overall volume is @xmath76 , implying @xmath77 ; * some sm singlets ( those present in admissible renormalizable couplings ) @xmath37 do not enter in the process of decoupling of unwanted matter and attain vevs @xmath78 .",
    "it follows that matter kinetic terms proportional to @xmath79 in the khler potential can be safely ignored ; * no twisted moduli nor blow - up modes appear , so that we can remain at the orbifold point ; * d - term contributions to the scalar potential are negligible .    under these conditions , the khler potential ( in the large - volume limit ) of the model introduced in sec .",

    ", @xmath86 is the well - known dedekind function , and @xmath87 comes from the explicit computation of string worldsheet instantons .",
    "the two contributions to @xmath83 come from the two hidden groups , 8 and 3 respectively .",
    "two remarks are in order : 1 ) the ellipsis in @xmath82 contains terms with higher powers in @xmath88 which we neglect because all @xmath3 are assumed to be large ; and 2 ) modular symmetries control the moduli dependence of the eta functions , e.g. only @xmath89 transforms covariantly under the unbroken @xmath90 modular symmetry .",
    "the structure of the superpotential is very rich .",
    "first , @xmath91 takes a racetrack form which can indeed lead to dilaton stabilization  @xcite ( although it must be noticed that the 3 contribution is subleading mainly due to the larger power of @xmath60 ) .",
    "second , @xmath92 is kklt - like which is known to yield potentially stable vacua with no or little fine - tuning .",
    "third , @xmath93 is a complicated combination of cusp forms , which exhibits several critical points .",
    "we would like to point out that the inclusion of matter fields in @xmath94 could be crucial for arriving to a de sitter vacuum  @xcite .",
    "it is also noticeable that , contrary to what happens in toy models in which there are gazillions of tunable parameters , the only parameters left free to tune in this promising model are @xmath95 and @xmath85 , connected to the decoupling of unwanted states and the gaugino condensates .",
    "therefore , the next task is just to compute the scalar potential and locate a minimum by varying these few free parameters around admissible values : @xmath96 .",
    "-10 mm    applying eqs .   and   to the general expression of the f - term potential , @xmath97 ( the indices @xmath98 label all chiral supermultiplets present and @xmath99 ) ,",
    "we have computed the scalar potential of the model . in the limits of our assumptions and with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ,",
    "we have found numerically dozens of vacua out of which we chose the one shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : unstabledsi ] . the scalar potential is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vacuum ] .",
    "unfortunately , all vacua are unstable for they turn out to have at least one tachyon . in the current model , the unstable direction is dominated by re@xmath103 .",
    "the problem relies most likely in the fact that there are plenty of vacua .",
    "exploring all of them becomes rapidly a numerical issue because of the complicated structure of the potential of orbifold models .",
    "there are , however , reasons to expect that a stable solution will emerge in a more refined search that will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .    on the bright side ,",
    "the vacua we find have the following properties :    * all vacua are de sitter with small cosmological constant ; * our setting favors anisotropic compactifications , which is one alternative to achieve precision gauge coupling unification and to solve the infamous hierarchy between the string scale and the unification scale @xmath104 ; * the overall volume turns out to be always large , in consistency with the khler approximation ; * although difficult , it is possible to reach larger values of @xmath2 , close to the expected value to accomplish gauge coupling unification at @xmath104 .",
    "we expect these features to be generic consequences of moduli stabilization via gaugino condensation in heterotic orbifolds .",
    "if a metastable vacuum can be found in these models , there are further questions connected to the dynamics of the moduli that must be answered .",
    "a successful string model should be able not only to reproduce the particle physics of our universe , but also to explain the structure and dynamics of the cosmos .",
    "one persisting problem is to explain the origin and dynamics of the rapid period of expansion of the observable dimensions , known as inflation ( for a nice review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "typically , it is assumed that there is some field , the inflaton , whose potential is almost flat and that has a minimum somewhere .",
    "many single and multi - field inflationary models have been concocted and lead to acceptable e - folds , primordial fluctuations and nongaussianities .",

    "remarkably , it has been found that , in certain scenarios , admissible fluctuations and nongaussianities are more natural in a universe dominated by multi - field dynamics  @xcite , as is always the case in string constructions .",

[ tab : unstabledsi ] .",
    "since these quantities correspond to the curvature of the potential on the directions of those fields in moduli space , there are some almost flat directions which , nevertheless , lead to a minimum .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : inflaton ] is a cartoon of this situation involving only two fields , where we have denoted them by @xmath107 and @xmath106 .",
    "we can now consider two different situations : when the coupling between @xmath107 and @xmath106 can not be neglected , and when @xmath114 . in the former case",
    ", we might arrive at the scenario described by hybrid inflation models .",
    "if the field @xmath106 rapidly develops a vev , the resulting scalar potential @xmath115 is just the ideal slow - roll potential , as displayed in the right panel of fig .",

    "<S> heterotic orbifold compactifications yield a myriad of models that reproduce many properties of the supersymmetric extension of the standard model and provide potential solutions to persisting problems of high energy physics , such as the origin of the neutrino masses and the strong cp problem . however , the details of the phenomenology in these scenarios rely on the assumption of a stable vacuum , characterized by moduli fields . in this note </S>",
    "<S> , we drop this assumption and address the problem of moduli stabilization in realistic orbifold models . </S>",
    "<S> we study their qualities and their 4d effective action , and discuss how nonperturbative effects indeed lift all bulk moduli directions . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting vacua , although still unstable , are typically de sitter and there are generically some quasi - flat directions which can help to deal with cosmological challenges , such as inflation . </S>"
