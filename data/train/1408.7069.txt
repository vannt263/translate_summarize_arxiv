    "the prospect of elts ( gmt @xcite , tmt @xcite , e - elt @xcite ) with their related high - dimensional adaptive optics ( ao ) systems , such as extreme ao ( xao ) , multiconjugate ao ( mcao ) or even multi - object ao ( moao ) , has aroused many developments in computationally efficient control algorithms .",
    "a good summary of the various techniques recently developed and their references can be found in @xcite .",
    "linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) regulator is one of them .",
    "this control approach , though introduced a long time ago in ao @xcite , has truly found a resonance only during the last decade .",
    "this success is motivated by the optimal control solution provided by lqg , as well as its ability to account naturally for various perturbations such as vibrations @xcite , limitations such as saturations @xcite or deformable mirror ( dm ) dynamics @xcite .",
    "+ lqg has thus demonstrated improved performance compared to other control solutions , both in numerical simulations and experimental implementations .",
    "however , this control solution suffers from various limitations , the major one being the computational complexity especially in the non - stationary framework .",
    "standard and brute force application of lqg is known to exhibit deterring computational cost , both in terms of off - line computations of the kalman gain and on - line computations through multiple matrix vector multiplications ( mvm ) . basically , assuming a number @xmath0 of state variables in the system , complexity of the off - line computations is proportional to @xmath1 , and complexity of the on - line computations is proportional to @xmath2 . moreover ,",
    "this number @xmath0 increases with the square of the telescope diameter in classical ao , and also with the number of reconstructed layers in tomographic approaches . as a consequence , reduction of computational complexity of kalman filter (",
    "kf)-based control solution has triggered much work in the recent years .",
    "the computational issue is significantly increased once considering non - stationary systems . as turbulence and system characteristics evolve with time",
    ", one would wish to update the control solution accordingly .",
    "for the lqg , this means redoing the off - line computations regularly , hence an additional computational cost .",
    "+ to circumvent these limitations , the ensemble transform kalman filter ( etkf ) has been previously introduced @xcite .",
    "this approach derives from methods developed in geophysics and meteorology in order to adapt the kf to large scale systems with non - stationary models .",
    "the etkf does indeed provide a theoretical alternative to the kf for non - stationary systems but has also dramatic computational limitations for these large scale systems .",
    "thus , a new control solution is discussed in which etkf has been modified to implement a zonal and localized approach briefly proposed in @xcite .",
    "this present paper differs from the previous one in that we are giving a detailed description of this new approach and the required mathematical formalism with new simulations in the case of a 16 m telescope and the resolution of the differential pistons issue .",
    "the zonal approach is motivated by the sparse matrices involved as well as by the difficulties encountered when dealing with huge number of modes ( typically , a few thousand to tens of thousands for elt ao systems ) such as zernike or karhunen - love modes ( edge effects , numerical issue in modes computing ) .",
    "in addition , zonal approach also allows to use fourier domain decomposition and wf reconstruction , benefiting from fast computation , though fourier domain based approaches may suffer from edge effects on circular ( annular ) apertures , requiring particular handling @xcite .",
    "localization here stands for decomposition of the system pupil into small domains on which local estimations are performed .",
    "all the local estimations are only combined in a final step , in order to deduce the full - pupil information .",
    "the result is thus a spatially distributed estimation based on the etkf , leading to a hierarchical control scheme .",
    "this approach allows a highly scalable implementation , as local computations are done with a reduced complexity and can be performed by a dedicated parallelized computation resource ( cpus / gpus cluster ) .",
    "+ this article is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 recalls the main ideas behind using the lqg control and a kf for a classical ao system , its limitations and some solutions developed to overcome these drawbacks .",
    "section 3 explains why the etkf - based control law can handle non - stationary behaviors and can offer the optimality of the kf , but becomes unsuitable for computational reasons . in section 4",
    "we present a new algorithm , the local etkf , and we explain why it is highly suitable for classical ao systems on elts ( fast and naturally parallel implementation , non - stationarity ) . in order to assess the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the potentiality of this new control law , some numerical simulations are detailed in section 5 .",
    "finally , conclusion and outlook of our work in progress are given in section 6 .",
    "it is now well - known that lqg provides the optimal control solution in ao , at least as long as the various underlying models ( turbulence , ao system components , noise ) are consistent with reality . to some extent",
    ", models can be approximated and lqg proves to be more efficient than any other control solution and to be also robust .",
    "usually , it is still pointed out that this solution suffers from higher complexity and computational cost .",
    "various works have been carried out to reduce this complexity and to propose faster computation even for large scale ao systems . as the local etkf basically derives from kf and",
    "uses similar formalism , in the following we first recall the basics of lqg and point out its main limitations . for the sake of simplicity , we discuss hereafter the lqg implementation in the framework of a classical ao system , although extension to tomographic systems has already been addressed @xcite .",
    "let us consider the simple ao system described in fig .",
    "1 . the phases @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent respectively the incoming turbulent phase , the ao correction provided by the dm and the residual phase .        in the astronomical framework considered here",
    ", the performance criterion consists in minimizing the variance of the residual phase ( identified usually as the empirical variance computed over a sufficiently large amount of time ) , with respect to the dm controls @xmath6 .",
    "though turbulence is a continuous time phenomenon , the residual phase is usually integrated by the wavefront sensor ( wfs ) over a time period @xmath7 ( frame ) , the ao control system is digital and correction is applied to the dm through a zero order hold ( zoh ) so that controls are constant over time period @xmath7 : see chronogram of the ao system in fig .",
    "2 .        in this context",
    ", kulcsr has shown in @xcite that the optimal turbulence correction by a sampled ao system is a problem that can be fully addressed in discrete - time . defining for any continuous - time variable @xmath8 its",
    "discrete - time counterpart @xmath9 as : @xmath10 the optimal performance criterion comes down to minimizing the discrete - time criterion : @xmath11 this equivalence is independent from the control solution , and while this result has been demonstrated assuming infinite dynamics of the dm ( instantaneous response ) in @xcite , correia has also extended it to the case of non negligible dm dynamics in @xcite . + as a conclusion , in the following we will consider the optimal criterion defined by eq . , and we will consider for that a discrete - time control problem .",
    "we will thus assume that the wfs is linear and provides a measurement @xmath12 of the incoming wavefront @xmath13 , integrated over the frame period @xmath7 , plus additional noise through the relation : @xmath14 where d is a linear operator accounting for the wfs measurement of the phase and @xmath15 is a discrete zero - mean gaussian measurement white noise . for the sake of simplicity , we will also assume that the dm is linear , has no dynamics and can be described by its influence matrix n ( the abscence of dm dynamics is clearly an optimistic hypothesis , though valid in most current ao systems : the impact of dm dynamics in the proposed control scheme is beyond the scope of this paper and should be addressed in the future ) .",
    "its correction over a frame period @xmath7 is constant ( due to the zoh ) and is therefore equal to : @xmath16 a two - frame delay ao system is thus considered as described in fig .",
    "2 . + now ,",
    "the ao control problem of minimizing the discrete - time criterion ( eq . ) in order to provide the optimal ao correction of the incoming turbulent wavefront @xmath3 finds its solution using the stochastic separation theorem @xcite . in a first step ,",
    "the turbulent phase is estimated .",
    "the solution to this stochastic minimum - variance estimation problem finds its expression in a kf .",
    "then , the estimated phase is projected onto the mirror s space with a simple least - square solution .",
    "the overall control scheme is thus a typical lqg regulator .      by using the structure of the lqg control and the associated kf described in @xcite",
    ", the turbulent phase @xmath17 can be defined on a zonal or a modal basis , and @xmath9 , the state vector at time @xmath18 , contains 2 occurences of this turbulent phase and 2 occurences of the voltages @xmath19 : @xmath20 the _ stationary _ stochastic linear state - space model can be defined with these two equations : @xmath21 the first equation characterizes the dynamics of the turbulent phase described for instance by a first - order auto - regressive ( ar 1 ) model ( a higher order ar model could be also considered ) : @xmath22 the vector @xmath19 contains the voltages that are applied on the dm .",
    "the vector @xmath23 is a zero - mean white gaussian model noise .",
    "the second equation is the observation equation : @xmath24 x_{k } + w_{k}.\\ ] ] the vector @xmath12 contains the measurements of the residual phase @xmath25 . as we wrote in section 2.1 , the estimation part can be separated from the control part .",
    "the optimal control @xmath19 can be obtained by separately solving a deterministic control problem and a stochastic minimum variance estimation problem . in eq .",
    ", the state vector @xmath9 includes control voltages , but these components do not need estimation .",
    "thus , in the following , the vector @xmath9 contains _ only _ the 2 occurences of the tubulent phase . the symbol _",
    "k / k _ denotes _ analysis _ or _ update _ and the symbol _",
    "k / k-1 _ denotes _ forecast _ or _",
    "prediction_. in the linear gaussian case , the optimal solution of the update estimate of the turbulent phase @xmath17 is given by a kf : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and with the update estimation error covariance matrix : @xmath28 and the kalman gain : @xmath29 @xmath30 is the measurement noise covariance matrix and @xmath31 is an extracted matrix from c , defined by @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the prediction estimate , at time k , is simply obtained with @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an extracted matrix from a , defined by @xmath35 .",
    "the prediction estimation error covariance matrix is calulated through the discrete algebraic riccati matrix equation ( dare ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the model noise covariance matrix .",
    "the deterministic control problem is simply solved through a least - squares projection of the predicted phase @xmath38 ( upper part of @xmath39 ) onto the dm s space . with a basic kf implementation",
    ", we must solve the dare in order to calculate this kalman gain @xmath40 @xcite . as we defined a stationary model , all the matrices of the state - space model",
    "are time - constant during the observation and the asymptotic formulation of the kf is applied without loss of optimality : the kalman gain is then precalculated with an off - line computation by solving the dare , which gives the asymptotic kalman gain ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "lqg has proved to provide efficient control and improved performance compared to other control solutions in the numerical simulations as well as in the experimental validations . since the very first works in ao @xcite ,",
    "various developments have been done in classical ao @xcite and in wide field tomographic ao @xcite .",
    "experimental validations in laboratory have been also carried out both in ao @xcite and mcao @xcite , while first validations on sky @xcite provided good demonstration of performance .",
    "+ nevetherless this control solution suffers from various limitations , the major one being the computational complexity , especially in the non - stationary framework .",
    "as recalled in introduction , brute force implementation of lqg is prohibitive in terms of computational complexity . as a consequence , reduction of computational cost of kf - based control solution has drawn much work in the recent years .",
    "for instance , poyneer @xcite has proposed the use of fourier decomposition of atmospheric turbulence and the statistical independence of the fourier modes to define a mode - by - mode regulator .",
    "a modal kf is used .",
    "this approach benefits naturally from mode decoupling ( sparsity ) and possible parallelization leading to computation speed up .",
    "correia @xcite improved the off - line computation of the kalman gain and real time operations by replacing mvm by spectral iterative methods with sparse approximation of the turbulence covariance matrix which avoids the resolution of the dare .",
    "massioni @xcite proposed the distributed kalman filter ( dkf ) , which approximates the kalman gain by assuming the telescope pupil as the cropped version of an infinite - sized phase screen .",
    "the method is based on a fourier transform that is used to decompose an infinite - order system into an infinite set of low , finite - order ones .",
    "fourier transform is used as an off - line tool to accelerate kalman gain computation , but on - line computation is also improved by sparsity in a zonal representation of phase .",
    "gilles compares in @xcite the performance and costs of two computationally efficient fourier based tomographic wavefront reconstruction algorithms , the dkf and the iterative fourier domain preconditioned conjugate gradient combined with a pseudo - open - loop control , showing very good performance of dkf and an acceptable computational burden . at the end , most of these solutions tends to propose a drastic reduction of the numerical complexity which becomes @xmath42 .",
    "lqg ( but also control approaches that do rely on turbulence statistics models ) is usually or systematically derived in a time - invariant framework : the turbulence model and the system models ( wfs , dm responses ) are considered as time - invariant .",
    "the turbulent model is usually pre - defined and the model matrices are usually derived from information gathered on the spot right before observation @xcite , or deduced from global statistics .",
    "this leads obviously to significant simplifications , both in formalism and computation : in particular , one can compute an asymptotic kalman gain , as mentioned before , which significantly reduces the real - time complexity of lqg .",
    "this is also motivated by a pragmatic trade - off between accuracy and efficiency : the goal is to provide good performance with simple enough models of turbulence , thus usually mentioned as control - oriented models .",
    "solutions mentioned in the previous section in order to speed up off - line and on - line computations rely on a time - invariant framework .",
    "+ while we can expect system models to present slow time evolution ( or at least predictible ) , this can not be said about turbulence models as turbulence statistics ( seeing conditions , average wind profile ... ) clearly evolve over time .",
    "then , one can consider updating the turbulence models , once in a while , based either on dedicated instruments information ( seeing monitor ) or real - time data as it is already performed on the sphere ao system for tip - tilt control @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "closed - loop data are directly used to identify periodically the turbulent tip - tilt models as well as possible vibrations .",
    "the resulting identification is used to update the kalman models and control solution . however",
    ", this implies a full update of turbulence models and recomputation of the kalman gain , as well as correct management of transitions @xcite .",
    "while this is affordable on limited - dimensional systems such as sphere , considering large scale ao systems comes to a dead - end .",
    "recent developments of fast computation of kalman gain @xcite may provide an interesting way out .",
    "+ however time - invariant system is not a prerequisite , and time - variant lqg can also be derived similarly : in the second case , the turbulent model matrices are time - variant , and consequently the kalman gain computation can not be precomputed off - line by convergence of the dare ( eq . ) .",
    "therefore , it must be computed at each step based on the current values of the turbulent model and system matrices through eqs . and .",
    "of course this situation leads to an unsuperable computational complexity as well as to the problem of defining , on every other steps , these time - evolving matrices .",
    "thus , embedding turbulence models identification and update within the control scheme , without significant increase of computational cost while ensuring performance , still represents an unreachable graal .",
    "+ the local etkf - based solution aims both at proposing a time - variant kf - based control solution and a reduced complexity , benefiting from the intrinsically parallel algorithm .",
    "although the lqg approach for ao systems with a stationary model has been successfully implemented on 4 - 8 m class telescopes , a similar implementation with non - stationary models is not possible for complex ao systems on elts .",
    "the major reason is the transition to very high - dimensional systems when explicit storage and manipulation with theoretical covariance matrices are not possible . in the kf - based method , there are two difficulties in inverting @xmath43 in eq . .",
    "the first one is the size : it is a @xmath44 matrix ( p is the number of measurements ) . for complex ao systems on elts , it can be costly to compute the inverse when @xmath45 .",
    "the second one is the fact that this matrix will be ill - conditioned and it may be extremely difficult to accurately evaluate its inverse .",
    "this situation led us to adapt a new method for large scale ao systems with non - stationary models .",
    "the original ensemble kalman filter ( enkf ) method is based on the kf s eqs . and , except that the kalman gain ( eq . ) is calculated from the covariance matrices provided by an ensemble of _ model states _ : it is a monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "a fixed number @xmath46 of model states of the turbulent phase on the whole pupil of the telescope composes the members of the ensemble @xmath47 , and by integrating it foward in time , it is possible to calculate the empirical estimation error covariance matrices with the following statistical estimator : @xmath48/\\sqrt{m-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the mean of the ensemble s members and @xmath50 is called the matrix of the _ anomalies_. to be precise , @xmath51 is the prediction anomalies matrix and @xmath52 is the update anomalies matrix . in other words ,",
    "the prediction estimate @xmath53 ( respectively the update estimate @xmath54 ) of the turbulent phase is given by the mean of the @xmath46 members of the ensemble @xmath55 ( respectively @xmath56 ) .",
    "all these members will constitute together a cloud of points in the state space and the spreading of this ensemble characterizes the prediction error variances by @xmath57 ( respectively the update error variances by @xmath58 ) .",
    "+ however , in this enkf formulation , it has been shown the need to add in the measurements @xmath12 some perturbations ( random variables calculated from a distribution with a covariance matrice equal to @xmath30 : for more details see @xcite ) , but this use of pertubated measurements introduces sampling errors that reduce the update covariance matrix accuracy . + another variant has been developed in order to form the update ensemble @xmath56 deterministically , avoiding part of the sampling noise .",
    "in particular , the update estimation is not given by the mean @xmath54 of the @xmath46 members ( model states ) of this ensemble @xmath56 , but directly by the estimate @xmath59 from the kf eq . .",
    "in the following , we present this deterministic algorithm for transforming the prediction ensemble @xmath55 into an update ensemble @xmath56 : it is called the ensemble transform kalman filter ( etkf ) .",
    "+ for the initial prediction ensemble , one can simply use @xmath60 .",
    "the etkf - based method does nt explicitly calculate the empirical covariance matrices , but transforms prediction anomalies @xmath51 into update anomalies @xmath52 by an ensemble transform matrix ( etm ) @xmath61 with the relation : @xmath62such that the empirical prediction covariance matrix @xmath63 and the empirical update covariance matrix @xmath64 , defined by eq . , both match the theoretical eqs . and .",
    "there are different solutions for the etm @xmath61 and following the mathematical approach in @xcite , a general form that satisfies eqs . and , and eqs . and , is : @xmath65^{-1/2}.\\ ] ]",
    "we emphasize that , in this study , we assume the measurement noise covariance matrix @xmath30 to be a stricly positive diagonal matrix ( no correlation between different subapertures ) . given the eigen value decomposition ( evd ) of the matrix @xmath66 whose size is @xmath67 , the solution for the etm @xmath61 can be obtained with this relation : @xmath68 where the orthogonal matrix @xmath69 contains the normalized eigenvectors of the @xmath67 matrix in the square brackets of eq .",
    "and the diagonal matrix @xmath70 contains the eigenvalues of the evd .",
    "since @xmath66 is a positive definite real symmetric matrix , its eigenvalues are real , strictly positive and its eigenvectors are orthogonal .",
    "+ both prediction and update covariance matrices belong to the same linear subspace spanned by the ensemble prediction anomalies @xmath51 .",
    "a distinguishing feature of the update anomalies @xmath52 produced by the etkf is that they are orthogonal under the inner product ( defining also a euclidian norm ) : @xmath71 .",
    "however , we have to notice that no more than @xmath72 independent update anomalies are generated from the expression in eq . because the sum of the @xmath46 prediction anomalies ( columns of @xmath51 ) is equal to zero :",
    "therefore , the rank of the empirical covariance matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 is equal to at most @xmath72 .",
    "+ actually , in this update scheme with the etkf - based control law , the eq . of the update estimate @xmath59 with the kalman",
    "gain @xmath40 given by eq .",
    ", is completely transformed by using the anomalies matrix @xmath51 and the etm @xmath61 with the sherman - morrison - woodbury identity ( see appendix a ) . as @xmath30 is a strictly positive diagonal matrix , it is straightfoward to calculate @xmath73 .",
    "let us define the vector @xmath74 where @xmath75 , and the matrix @xmath76 , the expression for the update estimate is therefore : @xmath77 the matrix of the @xmath46 members of the update ensemble @xmath56 is obtained with : @xmath78.\\ ] ]      in order to obtain each of the @xmath46 members of the prediction ensemble , we have to compute : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a zero - mean random gaussian vector characterising the model noise ( with a covariance matrice equal to @xmath37 ) .",
    "the prediction estimate @xmath81 is given by the mean of the @xmath46 members of the prediction ensemble @xmath82 and the prediction anomalies matrix @xmath83 is still given by the expression of eq . .",
    "let us note @xmath0 , the dimension of the state vector @xmath9 and @xmath84 , the dimension of the observation vector @xmath12 in eq . .",
    "in order to determine the theoretical numerical cost with a _ non - stationary _ turbulence model , we have to calculate the total number of all the mvm computed during the update step and the prediction step .",
    "actually , the significant computational cost of the etkf method is the update step . it can be proved ( appendix b ) that the resultant theoretical cost is : @xmath85 which is therefore linear over @xmath0 and @xmath84 with a proportional factor equal to @xmath86 .",
    "it will actually depend on the relative magnitudes of the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath0 and @xmath84 . with this etkf - based method ,",
    "it is numerically more efficient if the value of @xmath46 remains smaller than the values of @xmath0 and @xmath84 .      in the etkf - based method",
    ", there are two related limitations @xcite by using an ensemble with @xmath46 members for the calculations of empirical covariance matrices with eqs . and .",
    "+ the first limitation is the model space dimension of the finite size ensemble @xmath87 much lower than the one on the whole pupil of the telescope . if the ensemble @xmath87 has @xmath46 members , then the empirical prediction covariance matrices @xmath63 describe uncertainty only in the @xmath88-dimensional subspace spanned by the ensemble .",
    "the global update will allow adjustments to the system state only in this subspace which is usually rather small compared to the total dimension of the model space on the whole pupil of the telescope . as a small ensemble has few degrees of freedom available to represent estimation errors , this situation leads to sampling errors and a loss of accuracy with an underestimation of the true covariance matrices .",
    "thus , these empirical covariance matrices calculated from the @xmath46 members will not be able to match the model rank ( the effective number of degrees of freedom of the model ) unless this number of members increases considerably : this leads to an extremely high theoretical numerical complexity and no possibility of a realistic implementation on elts .",
    "the idea is therefore to perform _ locally _ all the updates so that , with different linear combinations of the ensemble members in various domains , the global update explores a much higher dimensional space .",
    "+ the second ( though related ) limitation is the spurious correlations over long spatial distances produced by a limited size ensemble @xmath87 . the empirical covariance matrices are calculated with the statistical estimator ( eq . ) where the ensemble @xmath87 of model states is considered as a statistical ensemble and the models ( turbulence , wfs ... ) are imperfect . therefore , the correlation calculations from the ensemble sample assign non - zero values to correlations between variables separated by a large distance ( compared to the fried parameter @xmath89 ) , which leads again to an underestimation of the true covariance matrices .",
    "it can be shown that variances of these spurious random correlations decrease when the number of members increases : however , it is not suitable for an implementation on elts . the idea is to determine the system s characteristic correlation distance , and then perform again _ locally _ so that the _ local update _ should ignore ensemble correlations for distances larger than this correlation distance / length ( which is not equal to @xmath89 ) .",
    "in the previous section , we have described two related shortcomings with the etkf - based control law , which lead to underestimate the theoretical covariance matrices . in order to overcome these drawbacks ,",
    "we have proposed the necessity to use local updates .",
    "thus , a new version called the local etkf @xcite has been developed using domain decomposition and localizations .",
    "there are two common localization methods in the enkf - based approaches .",
    "the first one is the local analysis ( la ) : the local update is performed explicitly by considering only the measurements from a local region surrounding the local domain by building a virtual local spatial window .",
    "this is equivalent to setting ensemble anomalies outside a local window to zero during the update .",
    "the second one is the covariance localization ( cl ) where the local update is performed implicitly : the prediction covariance matrices are tapered by a schur - product with a distance - based correlation matrix .",
    "it increases the rank of the modified covariance matrix and masks spurious correlations between distant state vector elements .",
    "as the two methods yield very similar results @xcite , we present in this section the la : thus , the idea of the local etkf is to split up the pupil of the telescope into various local domains on which all calculations of the update step are performed independently .      in order to understand the principles of the local etkf ,",
    "let us take the following example with a 16 m diameter telescope : fig .",
    "3 shows the locations of the valid actuators ( blue dots ) on the pupil sampled by a @xmath90 sh - wfs with a fried geometry : therefore , each square area between 4 valid actuators represents a subaperture . in the following ,",
    "we describe the local etkf - based control law on a _ zonal _ basis : the turbulent phase is estimated _ on the locations _ of all dm s actuators .",
    "32 sh - wfs.,width=113 ]    in this example , the domain decomposition is made of 25 ( red ) estimation subpartitions , called the _ local domains _ : each of them is composed by a fixed number of actuators . during the update step , for each local domain ,",
    "a local update estimate ( made up of all estimations on the actuators locations in this local domain ) is performed locally from the measurements coming only from the connected _ observation region _ ( made up of all subapertures _ including _ and _ surrounding _ the local domain ) .",
    "for instance , the observation region ( measurements region ) connected to the red central local domain ( estimation domain ) is the green one .",
    "+ with the local etkf - based method , only the update step will change : on _ each local domain _",
    ", there is an _",
    "independent _ update .",
    "therefore , this update step scheme enables highly parallel computations of markedly less data .",
    "+ we emphasize that it is essential to avoid as far as possible discontinuities between two neighboring local updates coming from two different local domains . to be precise",
    ", the two results of two update estimates coming from two nearby actuators on the border of two different local domains have to be similar .",
    "this can be ensured by choosing similar sets of observations for neighboring actuators , i.e. by taking two overlapping observation sets coming from two different neighboring local regions .",
    "moreover it is necessary to have a smoothed localization by gradually increasing the uncertainty assigned to the observations until beyond a certain distance they have infinite uncertainty and therefore no influence .",
    "this can be done by multiplying ( in eq .",
    "hereafter ) the square root inverse of the measurement noise covariance matrix by a decreasing function ( from one to zero ) as the distance of the observations from the center of the local observation region increases @xcite .",
    "we introduce a new notation where a tilde denotes the local version of the corresponding variable .",
    "for example : @xmath91 means the _ local _ prediction anomalies used for a given _ local _ domain d ; @xmath92 means the _ local _ measurements from the _ local _ observation region including and surrounding a given _ local _ domain d. in order to facilitate the understanding , we give also the size of each local variable obtained in the calculations .",
    "therefore , we use the new variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which are defined as @xmath0 and @xmath84 : they are respectively the dimension of the local state vector and the dimension of the corresponding local measurement vector _ on a local domain d_. + thus , for the update step , on _ each local domain d _ , we have to determine _ independently _ each local update @xmath95 by computing : @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 \\qquad ( n_{d},m).\\ ] ] with the concatenation of all those small matrices @xmath101 , we can finally compute the update members matrix @xmath102 . +",
    "then , the prediction step is computed _ globally _ on the whole pupil ( as it is done with the etkf in section 3.1.2 ) : the computation of the @xmath46 predicition members ( eq . ) for the prediction matrix @xmath103 , the prediction estimate @xmath81 and the prediction anomalies matrix @xmath83 .",
    "+ for the sake of understanding the ability of this algorithm to handle non - stationary behaviors , each local update estimate ( eq .",
    ") can be rewritten by factoring @xmath104 ( to the right ) : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is called the local kalman gain on the local domain d. with this last expression , we can clearly see that all local kalman gains are computed during _",
    "each _ update step , without the need to resolve a dare .",
    "therefore , we can have a non - stationary command with small modifications of the matrices @xmath91 and @xmath30 : there will be far fewer transitional issues than what happens with the lqg command and the full recomputation of all control matrices .",
    "moreover , during the prediction step , by using a ( to be defined ) identification procedure , we can update the ar model ( matrices @xmath34 and @xmath37 ) and take into account this modification with eq . .",
    "let us note @xmath107 the largest value of the dimensions @xmath108 of all local update estimates on all local domains , and @xmath109 the largest value of the dimensions @xmath110 of all observation vectors on all observation regions . with the local etkf , we have to distinguish two computational costs .",
    "+ the theoretical cost of the update step _ on each local domain _ is : @xmath111 . +",
    "this complexity is again linear over @xmath107 and @xmath109 with a proportional factor equal to @xmath86 .",
    "we emphasize that the values of @xmath107 and @xmath109 can be significantly smaller than @xmath0 and @xmath84 when the pupil of the telescope has been split up into many subpartitions : therefore , by using the result given in appendix b.1 , the total number of operations on each local domain can be much smaller . moreover , it will only depend on the size of the subpartitions ( number of actuators ) and not on the diameter of the telescope ( see table 1 in section 5.3 ) .",
    "actually this total number of operations will depend on the relative magnitudes of @xmath46 , @xmath107 and @xmath109 which are determined by an optimal trade - off between the size of the local domains , the size of the observation regions and the expected image quality ( see the various simulations in section 5.2 ) .",
    "+ for the prediction step , the theoretical cost is : @xmath112 .",
    "+ a key point is that both the calculations during the update step and the prediction step can be easely parallelized , which considerably speeds up the algorithm for ao systems on elts ( see discussion in section 5.3 ) .",
    "one particular consequence of the local etkf approach is the differential pistons issue . indeed , as described in section 4.1 , we perform a partition of the pupil of the telescope into various local domains , on which one local update estimate of the turbulence phase will be produced . afterwards , one global update estimate ( for each member of the ensemble ) and only one global prediction estimate are performed on the _ whole _ pupil . turbulence continuity from a local domain to its neighbors , is ensured to some extent in the overlapping of the observation regions , that includes for each connected local domain , the surrounding subapertures .",
    "however this continuity does not extend to piston which is not measured by the wfs .",
    "+ in other words , turbulence estimation on local domains is piston - free , which means _ ipso facto _ that a piston continuity issue will arise when combining all local update estimates of the turbulent phase . in order to calculate these differential pistons and to remove them ,",
    "we have now implemented a first effective and fast algorithm inside the ao loop , using a least - squares based method , which globally minimizes the local discontinuities and ensure phase continuity on the whole pupil .",
    "+ though straightforward , this algorithm allows improving significantly the local etkf performance ( see section 5.1 ) .",
    "however , this algorithm does not yet take into account the noise propagation at the level of turbulence phase estimation , and thus the influences on local pistons .",
    "of course , this is a foreseen improvement , that could simply rely on a regularized least - square method , taking advantage of our knowledge of phase estimation accuracy , embedded in the empirical update estimation error covariance matrix given by @xmath64 .",
    "in order to validate some of the items discussed in sections 3 and 4 , we have implemented the three previous control laws ( based on the kf , the etkf and the local etkf ) under the oomao matlab environment @xcite and we have also developed our openmp parallelized version . for this single conjugate ao ( scao ) system simulation , we consider a 16 m diameter telescope ( without central obscuration ) with a 32@xmath11332 microlenses s - h wfs . only the subapertures with a surface enlightened more than 50 % are considered and the number of valid subapertures is 812 that means @xmath114 .",
    "the linear response of the s - h wfs is emulated by a matrix which calculates differences of the phase in two directions at the edges of each subaperture @xcite .",
    "the ao system works in a closed - loop at 500 hz .",
    "there is a two - frame delay between measurement and correction .",
    "we assume that the dm has an instantaneous response and the coupling factor of the actuators is 0.3 . using a zonal basis ,",
    "the phase is estimated only on the actuators locations and the number of valid actuators is 877 that means @xmath115 .",
    "+ the criterion used in the comparisons is the coherent energy , defined by @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the temporal mean of the spatial variances of the residual phase @xmath118 .",
    "+ the loss of performance ( in % ) with the local etkf is calculated by using the optimal solution given by the kf : @xmath119 for the simulation of the atmosphere , we consider a von karman turbulence with a stationary model : @xmath89 = 0.525 m ( at 1.654 @xmath120 m ) , @xmath121 = 25 m , @xmath122 = 1.654 @xmath120 m ( for both wfs s and observation s wavelengths ) . using taylor s hypothesis , we can generate a superimposition of 3 turbulent phase screen layers moving at 7.5 @xmath123 , 12.5 @xmath123 and 15 @xmath123 , with a relative @xmath124 profile of 0.5 , 0.17 and 0.33 respectively .",
    "phase screens are generated on a 320@xmath113320 grid , with 10@xmath11310 points per each subaperture : the correction phase is therefore obtained by multiplying the prediction estimate on the actuators locations with an influence matrix of the dm .",
    "+ for the turbulence temporal model in the kf , in the etkf and in the local etkf - based control laws , we have chosen a _ first _",
    "order auto - regressive model ( ar1 ) @xcite .",
    "each value of the coherent energy has been calculated with several simulations of 5000 iterations ( 10 sec ) .",
    "the mathematical convergence of the ensemble kalman filters to the kalman filter in the limit for large ensembles has been proved in @xcite for linear forecast models .",
    "therefore , the first step is to obtain this theoretical result with the simulations for the etkf : it was done with one given value of noise variance equal to 0.04 @xmath125 for which the kf gives a coherent energy equal to 88.5 % . in fig .",
    "4 , each curve gives the coherent energy loss in % between the performance obtained with a control law ( etkf or local etkf on a 25 domains partition _ without _ removing or _ by _ removing differential pistons ) and the one given by the kf .",
    "this loss depends on the number of members and decreases to zero when the value of @xmath46 increases .",
    "the performance provided by the local etkf _ without removing _ differential pistons ( red dashed curve ) is better than the one provided by the etkf until a given number of members ( @xmath126 ) . indeed , concerning the phase estimation with the local etkf",
    ", there is a problem of reattachment between the various local domains discussed in section 4.4 : as the local update estimates of the turbulent phase are done separately on each local domain , we have to take into account the differential pistons and to reconstruct the entire phase estimate on the whole pupil of the telescope with all these various small turbulent phase estimates . + as the red solid curve shows , once differential piston has been removed with our first least - squares based method , the coherent energy loss compared with the kf is always lower than 4 % for numbers of members greater than 100 . with only 122 member ,",
    "this loss is already about 3.5 % on a 25 domains partition ( see also fig . 5 ) .",
    "the second step is to study different kinds of partitions and their influences on the performances for a fixed value of noise variance .",
    "figure 5 shows the coherent energy losses ( compared with the kf ) obtained with the local etkf in the case of five kinds of partitions and various values of members in the ensemble .    as already shown in fig .",
    "4 , for a given partition , the larger is the number of members , the smaller is the loss of performance . in the same way , _ for a fixed value of members _ ,",
    "the larger is the number of subpartitions ( or the smaller is the number of actuators per local domain ) , the smaller is the loss of performance : it confirms the specific problems of the etkf explained in section 3.3 and the solution given by the local etkf .",
    "the localization improves the efficiency of the etkf - based approach because , firstly the ensemble needs only to encompass the uncertainty within each of the small local domains ( with small numbers of degrees of freedom ) , and secondly the spurious long - range correlations produced by a limited ensemble size are removed .",
    "what is also important in this simulation with a 16 m telescope , is that we can choose a partition of the pupil , for which the loss of performance is less than 3% : for example with the @xmath127 partition and a number of members equal to 101 ( it will be also true with a larger number of subpartitions or a larger number of members ) . + the third step is to study the influence on the performance for different values of noise variance with a fixed number of members ( m = 101 ) .",
    "let us recall that in order to remove the differential pistons , our first least - squares based method does nt take into account the measurement error covariance .",
    "of course , for a given partition , when the noise variance increases , the loss of performance increases too . nevertheless , as fig .",
    "6 shows , the larger is the number of subpartitions , the smaller is the loss of performance when the noise variance increases . moreover , for the @xmath127 partition ( with a maximum of 16 actuators per local domain ) , the rosbustness of the local etkf compared to the kf seems to be very good for a large range of noise variance , while the correction of the differential pistons can be still improved .",
    "+ compared performance along the time for the kf and the local etkf is proposed in fig . 7 for various kinds of partitions .",
    "this figure shows that convergence speed and stability of the local etkf is very similar to the kf .",
    "it underlines once more that increasing the number of subpartitions allows to reduce the loss of performance compared with the kf and that a very small difference in performance is brought going from a @xmath127 to a @xmath128 partitions .",
    "the complexity given in section 4.3 is only theoretical .",
    "we want to evaluate the performance of a real parallel implementation of this intrinsically parallel algorithm based on the local etkf : therefore , we made some runtime tests in order to demonstrate that this method could be used for a 40 m telescope with a frequency up to 500 hz using nowadays computers .",
    "+ let us consider the 16 m telescope for which the loss of coherent energy compared with the kf is less than 3 % with the @xmath127 partition ( total of 69 domains ) and 101 members . in the case of a 40 m telescope with a @xmath129 sh - wfs ( and the same @xmath89 ) , by keeping local domains with the same maximum number of actuators , we can reach a similar coherent energy loss with the same number of members ( m = 101 ) .",
    "for the 16 m telescope with the @xmath127 partition , there is no more than 16 actuators per domain .",
    "for the 40 m telescope , in order to have no more than 16 actuators per domain , we must take a @xmath130 partition ( total of 373 domains ) . in this ao configuration ,",
    "our numerical simulations have confirmed that the loss of coherent energy is indeed less than 3% .",
    "each cycle of the ao loop has 3 steps : all the local updates ( calculated independently on each local domain ) , the prediction and the calculation of voltages @xmath131 .",
    "+ therefore , we propose to consider a multi - core architecture ( single computer or computation cluster ) , where each core is assigned to only one local domain and performs the local update computations . by using the results of table 3 and table 4 in appendix b",
    ", table 1 gives the theoretical numbers of floating - point operations during one cycle of the ao loop .",
    ".numbers of operations with m = 101 during one cycle of the ao loop . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     total number : @xmath132 multiplications + @xmath133 additions      the voltage @xmath19 is calculated with the mvm : @xmath134 .",
    "+ the matrix @xmath135 is a sparse matrix on a zonal basis . in our scao system , for a 16 m ( respectively a 40 m ) telescope , the sparsity of this matrix is 51 % ( respectively 88 % ) . actually , on a zonal basis , the matrix p can be much more sparse when , for each actuator , we take into account only the neighboring actuators close to less than 2 pitches .",
