    "the distance between the trajectories of an asteroid ( orbiting around the sun ) and our planet gives a first indication in the search for possible earth impactors .",
    "we call it orbit distance and denote it by @xmath3 . a necessary condition to have a very close approach or an impact with the earth is that @xmath3 is small .",
    "provided close approaches with the planets are avoided , the perturbations caused by the earth make the asteroid trajectory change slowly with time .",
    "moreover , the perturbations of the other planets produce small changes in both trajectories .",
    "the value of the semimajor axis of both is kept constant up to the first order in the small parameters ( the ratio of the mass of each perturbing planet to the mass of the sun ) .",
    "all these effects are responsible of a variation of @xmath3",
    ". we can study the evolution of the asteroid in the framework of the restricted 3-body problem : sun , planet , asteroid .",
    "then it is easy to include more than one perturbing planet in the model , in fact the potential energy can be written as sum of terms each depending on one planet only .",
    "if the asteroid has a close encounter with some planet , the perturbation of the latter generically produces a change in the semimajor axis of the asteroid .",
    "this can be estimated , and depends on the mass of the planet , the unperturbed planetocentric velocity of the small body and the impact parameter , see @xcite .",
    "the orbits of near - earth asteroids ( neas , i.e. with perihelion distance @xmath4 au ) 149,597,870 km ] are chaotic , with short lyapounov times ( see  @xcite ) , at most a few decades .",
    "after that period has elapsed , an orbit computed by numerical integration and the true orbit of the asteroid are practically unrelated and we can not make reliable predictions on the position of the asteroid .",
    "for this reason the averaging principle is applied to the equations of motion : it gives the average of the possible evolutions , which is useful in a statistical sense .",
    "however , the dynamical evolution often forces the trajectory of a nea to cross that of the earth .",
    "this produces a singularity in the averaged equations , where we take into account every possible position on the trajectories , including the collision configurations .",
    "the problem of _ averaging on planet crossing orbits _ has been studied in @xcite for planets on circular coplanar orbits and then generalized in @xcite including nonzero eccentricities and inclinations of the planets .",
    "the work in @xcite has been used to define proper elements for neas , that are integrals of an approximated problem , see @xcite . in this paper",
    "we compute the main singular term by developing the distance between two points , one on the orbit of the earth and the other on that of the asteroid , at its minimum points .",
    "this choice improves the results in @xcite , @xcite , where a development at the mutual nodes was used , because it avoids the artificial singularity occurring for vanishing mutual inclination of the two orbits .",
    "moreover , we show that the averaged vector field admits two lipschitz - continuous extensions from both sides of the orbit crossing set ( see theorem  [ der_jumps ] ) , which is useful for the numerical computation of the solutions .",
    "the orbit distance @xmath3 is a singular function of the ( osculating ) orbital elements when the trajectories of the earth and the asteroid intersect .",
    "however , by suitably choosing a sign for @xmath3 we obtain a map , denoted by @xmath5 , which is analytic in a neighborhood of most crossing configurations ( see @xcite ) .    here",
    "we prove that , near to crossing configurations , the averaged evolution of @xmath5 is more regular than the averaged evolution of the elements , which are piecewise differentiable functions of time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : orbdist ] contains some preliminary results on the orbit distance . in sections  [ s :",
    "avereq ] , [ s : extract ] , [ s : gensol ] we introduce the averaged equations , present the results on the singularity extraction method and give the definition of the generalized solutions , which go beyond crossing singularities . in section  [ s : dminevol ]",
    "we prove the regularity of the secular evolution of the orbit distance .",
    "section  [ s : numexp ] is devoted to numerical experiments : we describe the algorithm for the computation of the generalized solutions and compare the averaged evolution with the solutions of the full equations of motion .",
    "we also show how this theory can be applied to estimate earth crossing times for neas .",
    "let @xmath6 , @xmath7 be two sets of orbital elements of two celestial bodies on confocal keplerian orbits . here",
    "@xmath8 describes the trajectory of the orbit and @xmath9 is a parameter along the trajectory , e.g. the true anomaly .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the two - orbit configuration , moreover we set @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we consider bounded trajectories only .",
    "choose a reference frame , with origin in the common focus , and write @xmath12 , @xmath7 for the cartesian coordinates of the two bodies .",
    "for a given two - orbit configuration @xmath13 , we introduce the _ keplerian distance function _",
    "@xmath14 , defined by @xmath15where @xmath16 is the two - dimensional torus and @xmath17 is the euclidean norm .",
    "the local minimum points of @xmath14 can be found by computing all the critical points of @xmath18 .",
    "for this purpose in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the authors have used methods of computational algebra , such as resultants and grbner s bases , which allow us to compute efficiently all the solutions .    apart from the case of two concentric coplanar circles , or two overlapping ellipses , the function @xmath18 has finitely many stationary points .",
    "there exist configurations attaining 4 local minima of @xmath18 : this is thought to be the maximum possible , but a proof is not known yet .",
    "a simple computation shows that , for non - overlapping trajectories , the number of crossing points is at most two , see  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath19 be a local minimum point of @xmath20 .",
    "we consider the maps @xmath21for each choice of the two - orbit configuration @xmath13 , @xmath22 gives the orbit distance .",
    "the maps @xmath23 and @xmath3 are singular at crossing configurations , and their derivatives do not exist . we can deal with this singularity and obtain analytic maps in a neighborhood of a crossing configuration @xmath24 by properly choosing a sign for these maps . we note that @xmath23 , @xmath3 can present singularities without orbit crossings .",
    "the maps @xmath23 can have bifurcation singularities , so that the number of minimum points of @xmath14 may change .",
    "therefore the maps @xmath23 , @xmath3 are defined only locally .",
    "we say that a configuration @xmath13 is non - degenerate if all the critical points of the keplerian distance function are non - degenerate .",
    "if @xmath13 is non - degenerate , there exists a neighborhood @xmath25 of @xmath26 such that the maps @xmath23 , restricted to @xmath27 , do not have bifurcations . on the other hand , the map @xmath3 can lose regularity when two local minima exchange their role as absolute minimum .",
    "there are no additional singularities apart from those mentioned above .",
    "the behavior of the maps @xmath23 , @xmath3 has been investigated in @xcite . however , a detailed analysis of the occurrence of bifurcations of stationary points and exchange of minima is still lacking .    here",
    "we summarize the procedure to deal with the crossing singularity of @xmath23 ; the procedure for @xmath3 is the same .",
    "we consider the points on the two orbits corresponding to the local minimum points @xmath28 of @xmath18 : @xmath29 we introduce the vectors tangent to the trajectories @xmath30 at these points @xmath31 and their cross product @xmath32 we also define @xmath33 the vector @xmath34 joins the points attaining a local minimum of @xmath18 and @xmath35 .    from the definition of critical points of @xmath18 both the vectors @xmath36 , @xmath37",
    "are orthogonal to @xmath34 , so that @xmath38 and @xmath34 are parallel , see figure  [ regrule ] .",
    "denoting by @xmath39 , @xmath40 the corresponding unit vectors and by a dot the euclidean scalar product , the distance with sign @xmath41 is an analytic function in a neighborhood of most crossing configurations .",
    "indeed , this smoothing procedure fails at crossing configurations such that @xmath36 , @xmath37 are parallel .",
    "a detailed proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that , to obtain regularity in a neighborhood of a crossing configuration , we lose continuity at the configurations with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the derivatives of @xmath44 with respect to each component @xmath45 , @xmath46 of @xmath13 are given by @xmath47    we shall call ( signed ) orbit distance the map @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider a restricted 3-body problem with the sun , the earth and an asteroid .",
    "the motion of the 2-body system sun - earth is a known function of time .",

    "we write @xmath58 for the two - orbit configuration , where @xmath59 are delaunay s elements of the asteroid and the earth respectively . using the canonical variables @xmath60",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath64 is the difference of the two - body ( asteroid , sun ) hamiltonian @xmath65 and the perturbing function @xmath66 with @xmath67 considered as functions of @xmath68 .",
    "the function @xmath69 is the sum of two terms : the first is the direct part of the perturbation , due to the attraction of the earth and singular at collisions with it .",
    "the second is called indirect perturbation , and is due to the attraction of the sun on the earth .",
    "we can reduce the number of degrees of freedom of by averaging over the fast angular variables @xmath70 , which are the mean anomalies of the asteroid and the earth . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath71 becomes a cyclic variable , so that the semimajor axis @xmath72 is constant in this simplified dynamics . for a full account on averaging methods in celestial mechanics",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the averaged equations of motion for the asteroid are given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 are some of delaunay s elements , and @xmath76 with @xmath77 , is the vector of the averaged partial derivatives of the perturbing function @xmath69 .",
    "equation   corresponds to the scalar equations @xmath78    we can easily include more planets in the model . in this case the perturbing function is sum of terms @xmath79 , each depending on the coordinates of the asteroid and the planet @xmath80 only , with a small parameter @xmath81 , representing the ratio of the mass of planet @xmath80 to the mass of the sun .",
    "note that , if there are mean motion resonances of low order with the planets , then the solutions of the averaged equations may be not representative of the behavior of the corresponding components in the solutions of .",
    "moreover , when the planets are assumed to move on circular coplanar orbits we obtain an integrable problem .",
    "in fact the semimajor axis @xmath72 , the component @xmath82 of the angular momentum orthogonal to the invariable plane and the averaged hamiltonian @xmath83 are first integrals generically independent and in involution ( i.e. with vanishing poisson s brackets ) .",
    "taking into account the eccentricity and the inclination of the planets the problem is not integrable any more .",
    "in @xcite the secular evolution of high eccentricity and inclination asteroids is studied in a restricted 3-body problem , with jupiter on a circular orbit .",
    "nevertheless , crossings with the perturbing planet are excluded in that work . in @xcite",
    "there is a similar secular theory for a satellite of the earth .",
    "the dynamical behavior described in @xcite , @xcite is usually called _ lidov - kozai mechanism _ in the literature and an explicit solution to the related equations is given in @xcite .    if no orbit crossing occurs , by the theorem of differentiation under the integral sign the averaged equations of motion ( [ averrhs ] ) are equal to hamilton s equations @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the averaged perturbing function .",
    "the average of the indirect term of @xmath69 is zero .    when the orbit of the asteroid crosses that of the earth a singularity appears in , corresponding to the existence of a collision for particular values of the mean anomalies .",
    "we study this singularity to define generalized solutions of which go beyond planet crossings .",
    "since the semimajor axis of the asteroid is constant in the averaged dynamics , we expect that the generalized solutions can be reliable only if there are no close approaches with the planet in the dynamics of equations  .",
