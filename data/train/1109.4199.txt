    "the phenomenon of screening has long been known in presence of long - range coulomb interactions , and it is generally expected to render the observed behavior very similar to that of systems with short - range interactions . indeed , recent computational work has investigated the critical behavior close to charge ordering in lattice coulomb systems @xcite , suggesting the ising universality class .",
    "in addition , analytical arguments have been presented @xcite supporting this view , for a broad class of lattice models with the generalized coulomb interaction of the form @xmath5 in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "we should mention , however , that long - range interactions are generally expected to produce mean - field like critical behavior for @xmath6 , while for @xmath7 one expect short - range critical behavior .",
    "the nontrivial effect of long - range interactions upon the critical behavior is possible only for @xmath8 , because in this regime the interaction is `` integrable '' ( no neutralizing background is needed ) , and screening becomes inoperative .",
    "should one expect any interesting or novel physics in coulomb - like models ( @xmath1 ) , in comparison to the short - range situation ?",
    "our work confirms that these models indeed feature conventional critical behavior in the narrow critical region @xmath9 .",
    "we show , however , that a striking new behavior is uncovered in a broader temperature interval , reflecting strong geometric frustration inherent to such long - range interactions .",
    "first , we find a dramatic decrease of melting temperature of lattice coulomb gas as a result of the level of frustration in the system .",
    "this can be easily understood by noting that our lattice coulomb gas maps into an antiferromagnetic ising model with long - range interactions . here ,",
    "all the spin tend to anti - align with all other spins , but this can not be achieved for very long interactions ( @xmath1 ) , resulting in very low melting temperature .",
    "indeed , for half - filled coulomb systems ( @xmath10 ) , the melting temperature @xmath11 is one order of magnitude smaller @xcite than the generalized coulomb energy @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the lattice constant .",
    "continuum models @xcite show an even more dramatic behavior , with the melting temperature being as much as two orders of magnitude smaller then the coulomb energy .",
    "this striking behavior , although well documented in several model studies , is not widely appreciated or understood in simple terms .",
    "the second robust feature of these models , which has only recently been discovered @xcite , is the emergence of the `` pseudogap phase '' .",
    "this pseudogap phase is a specific feature of long - range type interaction with @xmath1 , and is observed in a broad temperature range @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , where @xmath15 is the pseudogap temperature where the gap in the single particle density of state ( dos ) starts to open .",
    "we show that the physical coulomb interaction ( @xmath10 ) lays deep in the regime of very long range interaction @xmath16 , the regime where our analytical `` extended dynamical mean - field theory '' ( edmft ) approach becomes is asymptotically exact @xcite .",
    "this observation explains the surprising accuracy of this analytical scheme both when applied to clean models @xcite , and in previous applications to coulomb glasses @xcite .",

    "our model is described by the hamiltonian of particles living on a half - filled hypercube lattice ( lattice spacing @xmath13 ) that interact via coulomb - like interaction @xmath23 , @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the distance between lattice sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 expressed in the units of the lattice spacing . in general , our unit of energy the nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath28 .",
    "we focus on the half - filled system @xmath29 that maps the problem into `` antiferromagnetic - like '' ising model .",
    "in addition to numerically - exact ( classical ) monte - carlo simulations , we also utilize an analytical approach , called so - called extended dynamical mean field theory ( edmft ) @xcite which is expected @xcite to be accurate for very long interaction @xmath30 , where the effective coordination number becomes very large .",
    "the inter - site charge correlations are included in this approach , and are treated on the same footing as the local ones @xcite . here",
    ", the lattice problem is mapped into an effective impurity problem embedded in a self - consistently determined bath containing both fermionic and bosonic excitations @xcite . in our case , this bosonic bath describes the plasmon excitations induced by the inter - site charge correlations .     of plasmon modes on a 3d hypercubic lattice .",
    "the low - energy branch of the spectrum , which describes the `` sheer '' charge fluctuations close to the ordering wavevector , features an @xmath31-dependent energy scale , one that sets the melting temperature @xmath32 .",
    "the scaling becomes exact for very long interaction range @xmath33 , but is approximately valid for all @xmath34 , explaining the simple @xmath31-dependence of all quantities.,width=278 ]    in this paper , we focus on the classical limit , where the origin of the pseudogap phase is most pronounced and the accuracy of the edmft can be tested directly with simple classical monte carlo simulations .",

    "the depression of melting temperature as a function of interaction parameter @xmath53 can be understood in simple way by noting that the spectral density @xmath38 has a simple scaling form @xmath54 as shown in fig .",
