    "<S> products of surface gravities , surface temperatures , komar energies , electromagnetic potentials , angular velocities , areas , entropies , horizon radii and the irreducible masses at the cauchy and the event horizons are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the product of surface gravities , surface temperature product and product of komar energies , electromagnetic potentials and angular velocities at the horizons are not universal quantities for kerr - newman - kasuya black hole . </S>",
    "<S> products of areas and entropies at both the horizons are independent of mass of the black hole . heat capacity is calculated and phase transition is observed , under certain conditions on @xmath0 . using the thermodynamics method with quantized charges ( known as refined thermodynamics ) , the central charges and the holographic pictures ( j - picture , q - picture , and p - picture ) of the dual cft for kerr - newman - kasuya black hole are determined . </S>"
