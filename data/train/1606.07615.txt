    "<S> in this paper , the fractional order of rational bessel functions collocation method ( frbc ) to solve thomas - fermi equation which is defined in the semi - infinite domain and has singularity at @xmath0 and its boundary condition occurs at infinity , have been introduced . </S>",

    "<S> this approach at first , obtains a sequence of linear differential equations by using the quasilinearization method ( qlm ) , then at each iteration solves it by frbc method . to illustrate the reliability of this work , we compare the numerical results of the present method with some well - known results in other to show that the new method is accurate , efficient and applicable </S>"
