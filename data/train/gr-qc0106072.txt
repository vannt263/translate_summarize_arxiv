    "the beginnings of the twentieth century witnessed a major revolution in our understanding of gravitation .",
    "einstein s theory radically changed the way we conceived gravity and its effects . unraveling the messages that his theory contains",
    "requires the ability of solving a coupled nonlinear system of ten partial differential equations .",
    "these are ` special ' equations as they govern the very structure of the spacetime itself ( as opposed to other theories where the fields evolve ` on top ' of an unchanging spacetime ) .    for about six decades , only in special situations were researchers able to obtain solutions to these equations .",
    "these assumed the existence of symmetries and/or concentrated on asymptotic regimes that allowed considerable simplifications of the equations reducing them to a manageable ( and solvable ) system .",
    "although certainly considerable ` new ' physics has been learned from einstein s theory , its full implications remain elusive .",
    "the last decades of the twentieth century witnessed another revolution .",
    "this one , the ` computer revolution ' , was spurred by the computational capabilities that powerful computers provided researchers .",
    "this new tool allows the study of systems which would otherwise be impossible ( or extremely involved ) analytically .",
    "simulations not only are letting researchers tackle difficult problems but also allow for a nice visualization of the outcome .",
    "these simulations serve as theoretical laboratories for general relativity , where , the past impossibility of constructing a gravitational laboratory prevented data - driven research from aiding in our explorations of the theory .",
    "we have already witnessed some of the benefits that these ` numerical laboratories ' can provide , for instance , they have demonstrated the existence of critical behavior in general relativity and naked singularities in gravitational collapse ; the possible appearance of toroidal event horizons ; indicated generic properties of singularities in cosmological contexts ; provided more accurate understanding of rapidly rotating neutron stars and shed light into the structure of singularities .",
    "the continuous improvements in computer power coupled with the gained ( and being gained ) experience in simulating einstein equations signal that , after almost a century , we are on the path of unveiling what these equations have so far kept hidden .    computer simulations are and will increasingly be of crucial importance to let us study strongly gravitating systems like those containing massive stars and/or black holes ; spacetimes on the verge of black hole formation ; investigation of cosmological scenarios , studies of structures of singularities and even for investigations of different aspects of possible quantum theories of gravity .    clearly , understanding these issues is very important academically since it will definitively advance our scientific knowledge .",
    "additionally , a thorough understanding of some of these systems is also relevant from a `` more practical '' point of view .",
    "technology is also setting us at the verge of being capable , for the first time , to directly test general relativity in the strong field limit and use it to obtain a new window with which to scrutinize our universe .",
    "the beginnings of the twenty first century will witness the operation of several highly sensitive gravitational wave earth-(and probably space)-based detectors@xcite .",
    "these detectors will allow researchers to study signals produced from strong field systems and therefore will provide a chance to test a theory which has so far proven very successful in weak regime scenarios .",
    "these signals carry specific signatures of the system that produced them and therefore their detection and analysis will represent a new form of astronomy , `` gravitational wave astronomy''@xcite",
    ". this astronomy will require accurate models of the sources and the waveforms they produce to decode the information carried out by gravitational waves .",
    "these models will be provided by numerical relativity .",
    "the importance of numerical models of relativistic systems can not be overestimated .",
    "this has been reflected in the growing interest in numerical relativity since its first tentative steps in the late 60 s .",
    "perhaps this growth is better described by noting that a review on the status of numerical relativity 30 years ago would have been dedicated to describe what the pioneers of this field , hahn & lindquist@xcite ; smarr@xcite and eppley @xcite studying black hole spacetimes and wilson@xcite investigating neutron stars were doing back then .",
    "these pioneers foresaw the importance of computers in modeling otherwise intractable problems .",
    "these first ventures spurred throughout the years a large number of projects in many different directions . as a consequence , a comprehensive review would demand a complete edition of classical and quantum gravity to justly describe most efforts and directions being studied at present .",
    "this , naturally , speaks well for the status of the field , signaling how much momentum has gathered in the past decades and how an increasingly important role is playing in today s gravitational research .",
    "unfortunately , lack of space will not allow for fairly addressing all ` flavors ' of numerical relativity research .",
    "the vast number of areas renders covering all them impossible ; as much as i tried presenting a comprehensive overview , some topics or a more detailed presentation of others are not included and i apologize in advance for this . in particular , i very much regret not being able to extensively cover areas like relativistic hydrodynamics , critical phenomena and computational cosmology in this article .",
    "fortunately , excellent recent reviews are available on these subjects ( and i will refer the reader to them as i briefly go through the subjects ) .",
    "this review should be considered complementary to these .",
    "i will put more emphasis on areas which i consider basic to understand the present status of the field ( and that are common to all areas of numerical relativity ) and to serve as a guidance to researchers and students willing to immerse in this wonderful ( relatively ) new discipline in g.r .",
    "+ the _ main goal of numerical relativity _ is to provide the description of the spacetime by solving einstein equations numerically .",
    "this numerical implementation provides the metric @xmath0 on , at least , some region of the manifold @xmath1",
    "( @xmath2 being an orientable , n - dimensional manifold of all physical events and @xmath0 a lorentzian metric tensor ) .",
    "this manifold is assumed to be simply connected and globally hyperbolic , therefore , given appropriate data on an initial hypersurface , its future development can be obtained by means of solving einstein equations@xcite . [",
    "although analytical extensions of non - globally hyperbolic formulations can be obtained , the numerical treatment of such situations is much more complex and has so far not been considered ] .",
    "perhaps an obvious point sometimes overlooked when thinking of numerical models to solve a given problem is that _ computers are not magic ! _ although our computational resources give us a powerful tool with which to attempt solving a problem , it certainly does not provide a magical solution .",
    "one must worry about the ` standard points ' proper of the traditional ` pencil and paper method ' but also keep in mind that a numerical simulation will be employed , which adds a new dimension to the specification of the problem .",
    "hence , before attempting any computation one must carefully    * choose appropriate form of equations and set of variables that govern the system * adopt a suitable reference frame with respect to which describe the system * define initial and/or boundary conditions    in a numerical approach , the aforementioned points should be chosen in a way that will possibly aid , or at least not harm , the numerical implementation .",
    "this introduces a new set of choices    * discretization strategy * specific algorithms    i will organize the presentation following this rather natural path .",
    "i review in section ii the basic arena , giving an introductory description about the issues involved in obtaining the system of equations , coordinates choice and initial and boundary conditions .",
    "then , in section iii , a more detailed presentation of the three main avenues towards implementing einstein equations presently employed is presented . in each case , a particular representative system is discussed as an example , how coordinate systems can be chosen and the initial and boundary values specification is addressed ( here for the sake of clarity i will concentrate on the vacuum case ) .",
    "section iv is devoted to some generic aspects related to numerical techniques while section v to particular issues related to the numerical implementations ( separately addressing particulars of the three avenues presented in section iii ) . in section vi",
    ", i discuss the main aspects and techniques related to non - vacuum problems .",
    "then , in section vii a ( partial ) list of the main past accomplishments of the field are presented while section viii comments on the major current problems and results . towards the end , in section ix ,",
    "i describe a few efforts towards employing numerical simulations as a complementary technique to fully describe binary systems from their very early stages to the final merged object .",
    "finally , in section x , i briefly comment on the main problems for the future and conclude in section xi . + note : when writing this article i had three audiences in mind .",
    "researchers outside the field who just want to get a current glimpse on the main issues and approaches of the field to whom i would recommend sections i through iii , vii , viii , x and xi .",
    "another one of those interested in getting involved in numerical relativity , who additionally might find sections iv and vi useful in ` breaking the ice ' . and",
    "finally practitioners of the field who i hope will benefit from a comprehensive literature survey throughout the article , specific discussions in sections v and ix and the ` broad picture ' of future possible directions presented in section x. + throughout this paper i adopt geometric units where @xmath3 . additionally , small case latin letters in the first half of the alphabet range from 1 to 4 and those from @xmath4 on range from 1 to 3 , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "* system of equations * + the theory of general relativity clearly stands out from all others by the fact that the spacetime , defined as the pair @xmath5 is ` obtained ' from einstein equations all at once .",
    "what one solves for is the geometry , not for a particular metric tensor ( since two tensors differing by a diffeomorphism describe exactly the same geometry ) .",
    "the ` unknown variables ' do not ` live ' on top of the spacetime , but rather they are precisely the spacetime .",
    "hence , right from the start , the problem of even posing the equations is not a straightforward one .",
    "einstein equations , @xmath6 , ( with @xmath7 the einstein tensor and @xmath8 the stress energy tensor ) are completely independent of any coordinate system .",
    "the lack of a preferred frame of reference , which is a natural manifestation of the equivalence principle , is at the very core of the theory .",
    "the complete freedom in the frame choice is in practice exploited to express the equations in a more convenient way which has lead to several formulations of general relativity .",
    "roughly speaking , a notion of time is introduced and the level surfaces defined by this time can be spacelike ( giving rise to a _ ` 3 + 1 ' or cauchy approach to gr _ ) , null ( defining a _ characteristic approach _ ) , or of more generic type ( which yield the approaches like the _ conformal einstein equations _ ; _ cauchy - characteristic matching _ ,",
    "once the system of equations is chosen , as is the case with any simulation , care must be taken with adopting ( i ) a preferred set of suitable coordinates ( so that from the equivalence class of metric tensors defining the same geometry a single one is obtained ) and ( ii ) appropriate initial and boundary data for the problem under consideration . + * suitable coordinates * + when einstein equations are recast in a way amenable to a dynamical description , one coordinate , say @xmath9 , is chosen to play the role of ` time ' with respect to which the dynamical evolution will referred to .",
    "then , n-1 additional coordinates , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , are introduced at the level surfaces ( @xmath12 ) of the time parameter .",
    "these coordinates could be standard like cartesian ; spherical , cylindrical , etc . or others better suited for specific problems .",
    "note that one still has quite some freedom left , namely the rate of change of the time coordinate need not be uniform as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "additionally , the @xmath10 at different values of the time coordinates might not be constant along the direction normal @xmath12 , ie .",
    "might be `` shifted '' . exploiting this freedom",
    "has proven useful in numerous analytical studies ( eg . the use of harmonic coordinates render einstein equations in an explicitly hyperbolic form which is convenient to analyse properties of the expected solution ) . in numerical implementations",
    "this freedom can prove crucial and the adoption of convenient coordinates is a very delicate ( and important ) problem which has no ` clear cut ' solution .",
    "these `` ideal '' coordinates satisfy the following properties    * * singularity avoidance properties ( a ) or amenability for singularity excision ( b ) : * spacetimes containing singularities can be approached by either `` slowing down '' the rate of time change in a region near the singularity so that the evolution is `` frozen '' , thus avoiding the evaluation at singular regions ( a ) or excising the singularities from the computational domain , thus getting rid of the problematic region , this can safely be done assuming the singularities are not `` naked '' due to the event horizon hiding the excision process ( b ) . * * simplification of variables : * properly chosen coordinates might simplify the metric tensor .",
    "for instance , in the presence of a symmetry , by choosing a coordinate adapted to the congruence defined by such symmetry the metric tensor does not explicitly depend on such coordinate . *",
    "* degrees of freedom : * adopting coordinates that manifest the true degrees of freedom might help obtaining accurate physical predictions . * * radiation propagation : * when gravitational waves are sought for , coordinates adapted to a natural radiation gauge can considerably simplify the numerical treatment@xcite    with prior knowledge of the dynamics of the system it is certainly easy to come up with coordinate prescriptions satisfying these properties .",
    "however , we need numerical simulations to obtain this knowledge !",
    "a great deal of effort has been put into obtaining reasonable recipes to appropriately choose coordinates and i will outline several proposals in this direction . however",
    ", our present knowledge on this subject is still rather limited , the field would certainly benefit from further research in this direction . + * initial conditions * + specification of the initial and boundary data determine the physical situation under study .",
    "in general relativity , a theory with only two degrees of freedom ` hidden ' in the six components of @xmath0 ( assuming four are fixed by coordinate conditions ) , it is not expected that all can be specified freely at the initial time ; rather , there must be constraints limiting the possible choices .",
    "consequently , before starting the evolution problem , one must take care of the initial value specification which requires careful examination of the constraint problem .",
    "additionally , even when the equations defining consistent initial data can be readily solved ( in terms of some freely chosen functions ) , these must be chosen so that they represent the targeted physical system . + * boundary conditions * + as important as the initial value specification is that of the treatment of the possible boundaries .",
    "these boundaries can be at the ` outer edge ' of the computational domain ( referred to as _ outer boundaries _ ) or inside the computational domain ( referred to as _ inner boundaries _ ) . not only must the prescription of boundary data correspond to the physical situation in mind , but also its implementation not give rise to spurious reflections which could contaminate the described physics or , even worse , render the simulation unstable . properly addressing",
    "the boundary implementation is a highly non - trivial problem even in simple systems .",
    "for instance , when modeling the simple wave equation in dimensions higher than one , correct boundary value specification requires a non - local procedure which represents a significant computational overhead@xcite . in nonlinear systems , where backscattering is expected , this problem becomes very difficult and a general solution is not known even at the analytical level .",
    "clearly , the numerical treatment of the boundary value problem is a delicate issue , and i will review the present way of handling it in the next sections .",
    "+   + in the following section i will comment on how the above mentioned problems are addressed in the different formulations that have made their way into numerical relativity .",
    "however , most of what i describe here applies to the non - vacuum case , the additional problem is the accurate treatment of the equations governing the matter variables . ] .",
    "in the 3d cauchy ( or `` 3 + 1 '' ) formulation of einstein s equations , one foliates @xmath1 with a parametrized ( with parameter @xmath13 ) set of spacelike , 3-dimensional hypersurfaces @xmath12 and chooses coordinates @xmath10 ( i=1 .. 3 ) to label points on each one .",
    "thus , the spacetime points have coordinates @xmath14 .",
    "the standard 3 + 1 decomposition presented in  @xcite , chooses @xmath15 as the future - pointing timelike unit normal to the slice , with @xmath16 @xmath17 is the _ lapse function _ defining the proper interval measured by observers traveling normal to the hypersurface .",
    "since coordinates need not be chosen to remain constant along the normal direction ( as they can freely specified at each @xmath12 ) , they are related by a _ shift vector _ defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 so , in this frame , @xmath20 . if the ( euclidean ) metric of each @xmath12 is given by @xmath21 ( defined as the pull - back of @xmath0 onto @xmath12 ) the spacetime metric results @xmath22 @xmath21 is regarded as a fundamental variable while @xmath17 and @xmath23 mere manifestations of the coordinate freedom proper of general relativity .",
    "when writing down einstein equations in this approach , a second order pde system results where , in particular , six equations contain second time derivatives of @xmath21 ( obtained from @xmath24 ) . in order to properly specify the initial value problem , the first time derivative of @xmath21",
    "must be also specified at an initial hypersurface . instead of this ,",
    "one usually provides @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the lie derivative along the @xmath15 direction . from @xmath25 the first time derivative of @xmath21",
    "is readily obtained but @xmath25 is preferred ( as it has a natural geometrical interpretation , being the second fundamental form or extrinsic curvature of the @xmath12 embedded in the four - dimensional spacetime ) . with these definitions ,",
    "einstein equations are expressed ( with the aid of the gauss ",
    "ricci conditions ) as @xmath28 - d_i d_j\\alpha \\ , ; \\label{3plus1k } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath29 ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the covariant derivative and ricci tensor compatible with @xmath21 and @xmath32 .    hence , @xmath21 and @xmath25 are the set of initial data that must be specified for a cauchy evolution of einstein s equations .",
    "equations  ( [ 3plus1h ] ) and ( [ 3plus1k ] ) constitute the evolution equations which are used to obtain the spacetime to the future of the initial hypersurface .",
    "there still remains four extra equations which we have so far not considered ( from @xmath33 , which do not contain second time derivatives of @xmath21 ) .",
    "these equations are @xmath34 and @xmath35 equation  ( [ eq : hamiltonian - const ] ) is referred to as the _ hamiltonian _ or _ scalar constraint _ , while ( [ eq : momentum - const ] ) are referred to as the _ momentum _ or _",
    "vector constraints_. these equations impose conditions that @xmath21 and @xmath25 must satisfy and therefore restrict their possible values . fortunately , only at the initial hypersurface must one worry about satisfying the constraint equations as the bianchi identities guarantee they will be preserved on future slices of the evolution .",
    "providing data satisfying the constraint equations is not a trivial task , we will return to this issue in section  [ initial_data ] .",
    "this cauchy or ` 3 + 1 ' formulation is customarily called adm in numerical relativity jargon , instead of the adm conjugate momentum @xmath36 . ] and has been the system until recently has received the most attention in numerical relativity . however , this system is by no means the only ` 3 + 1 ' approach .",
    "many related formulations can be readily obtained from the adm .",
    "for instance , one can choose ( i ) to use a different combination of variables ; ( ii ) the constraints can be freely added to the equations ( premultiplied by arbitrary functions ) and ( iii ) extra variables can be introduced to eliminate second order spatial derivatives ( with the consequent enlargement of the system of equations ) .",
    "[ note that these in turn can be expressed in terms of tensor , frame or tetrad components ] .",
    "several of these options have been exploited to come up with new , and of course , physically equivalent re - formulations which explicitly display some desirable properties . among those ,",
    "a number of symmetric hyperbolic formulations have been presented ( using ( i)-(iii ) ) and are starting to make their way into numerical relativity ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "these formulations are written in first order form and the standard mathematical machinery for pde s can be used to determine the well posedness of the problem under study ; whether the characteristic speeds of the system are physical ( lie inside the null cones ) and furthermore , determine which combination of variables are ingoing and outgoing with respect to a given boundary .",
    "this plays an important role when imposing boundary conditions ( see next section ) .",
    "additionally , other , ` less ambitious ' systems [ obtained using ( i)-(ii ) ] aimed towards isolating the physical modes of the solution have recently become quite popular in numerical relativity . this approach known as bssn is displaying in a number of cases better behaved evolutions than those obtained with the adm formulations@xcite .",
    "+      in this approach , adopting coordinates conditions means providing a prescription for @xmath17 and @xmath23 ( the lapse and shift vector ) .",
    "one would like this prescription to be ideally suited for the simulation ; however , as mentioned previously , this is not generally possible without prior knowledge of the expected dynamics . to achieve this",
    ", one can somehow ` tie ' the coordinate conditions to the dynamics of the fields so as to obtain some ` feedback ' on how these coordinates should be chosen . in practice , either ` evolution ' equations or equations at a given surface ( elliptic )",
    "are employed for this purpose . the former approach , although sound in principle , should be treated with special care , as some choices might lead to coordinate pathologies @xcite .",
    "the latter option involves solving elliptic equations which are computationally expensive , nevertheless have proven quite useful . in the following",
    "we will present some of the options being pursued .",
    "these can be grouped into three different strategies : `` geometrical '' ; `` simplifying '' and  cost - reducing \" conditions .",
    "the division between the first two is clear in methodology but not necessarily in the final results since , as we will see next , some conditions are obtained with either strategy . in the third group , i gather computationally less expensive conditions defined ( i ) to retain some of the properties of those in the first two groups while at the same time simplify their numerical implementations or ( ii ) derived from known solutions . + * `` geometrical '' prescriptions * + _ lapse condition : maximal slicings _ + the first of these prescriptions was suggested by lichnerowicz@xcite and later extended by york@xcite , known as the family of ` maximal slicings ' . these slices",
    "maximize the 3-volume of the slices , hence the name .",
    "this condition translates into slices that effectively deform so that @xmath37 which in turn implies a non - uniform @xmath17 .",
    "a straightforward evaluation of the trace of equation ( [ 3plus1k ] ) ( and using the hamiltonian constraint to re - express the ricci tensor in terms of @xmath25 ) , provides the elliptic equation for @xmath17 , @xmath38 although it is not clear that a solution to the above equation will always exist , in present and past applications ( in the particular case of @xmath39 ) it has proven quite useful .",
    "not only does it provide a usable definition for the lapse , but the resulting slicing tends to ` avoid the singularities'@xcite .",
    "note that from equation ( [ 3plus1h ] ) one straightforwardly obtains the equation @xmath40 which describes the evolution of the determinant of @xmath21 . in the case",
    "where @xmath41 the singularity avoidance property of this slicing is clear as the variation of the local volume remains fixed .",
    "this effectively slows down the evolution in regions of strong curvature while the simulation proceeds in the farther regions .",
    "unfortunately , this feature comes at a price .",
    "the same property that makes it enticing carries the crux when attempting long simulations of singularity - containing spacetimes . as the evolution proceeds , the slices `` pile - up '' in regions of high curvature while not in weaker curvature regions .",
    "the sequence of slices result considerably ` bent ' and large numerical gradients are induced ( this problem is usually referred to as grid stretching ; however the grid clearly does not stretch , rather the proper distance between grid points become large ) .",
    "as the evolution proceeds these gradients become larger and ultimately the evolution crashes . in almost all implementations employing maximal slicings , the choice of @xmath39 has been adopted .",
    "recently , the properties of slices with non - vanishing @xmath42 have been analyzed in 1d illustrating the potential advantages of such choice@xcite .",
    "+ _ shift conditions : minimal strain and minimal distortion _ + a shift condition known as ` minimal strain ' was introduced by smarr and york@xcite through a set of elliptic equations obtained via a minimization of the hypersurface strain . minimizing an action defined with @xmath43 and @xmath44 with respect to @xmath23 yields the ( elliptic ) set of equations , @xmath45 a related condition known as ` minimal distortion '",

    "generalized smarr - york conditions. recently , garfinkle et .",
    "al . have studied the question of existence and uniqueness of this system@xcite .",
    "the authors conclude that although there is a potential case for non - uniqueness , this problem can be avoided by an appropriate choice of slice and boundary conditions .",
    "+ these conditions have the desirable property of reducing the possible distortion in the spatial coordinates due to the `` evolution '' of the spatial slices@xcite .",
    "additionally , they minimize the rate of change along @xmath51 which is indeed appealing as the metric variables should vary slowly in the resulting coordinates .",
    "+ * `` simplifying '' prescriptions * + _ coordinate conditions : ` symmetry seeking coordinates ' _",
    "+ recently@xcite , prescriptions have been obtained by demanding the existence of some ` approximate ' symmetries .",
    "in@xcite the authors approached the problem by demanding the coordinates be chosen such that , if the spacetime has an approximate timelike killing vector , they adapt to the ( approximate ) symmetry .",
    "this ( pseudo-)symmetry was expressed in terms of a homotetic killing vector @xmath52 , satisfying @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 if @xmath52 is a killing vector ) .",
    "the homotetic condition gives rise to evolution equations for @xmath0 which in turn imply equations for @xmath55 ; namely @xmath56 for the coordinate conditions to follow closely the evolutions of the metric variables , equations ( [ garfh],[garfk ] ) are combined with the evolution equations ( [ 3plus1h],[3plus1k ] ) to obtain a constrained system ( since twelve equations are obtained but only four variables are to be fixed ) .",
    "there is clearly a vast range of possibilities ; some of the proposed options for the lapse are :    * contraction of ( [ garfh ] ) with @xmath25 , giving rise to @xmath57 .",
    "[ which will not be useful if @xmath58 .",
    "* contraction of ( [ garfk ] ) with @xmath21 which results in @xmath59=0 $ ] .    and for choosing the shift ,    * divergence of ( [ garfh ] ) , resulting in @xmath60 . which is precisely the ` minimal strain shift ' condition .",
    "* divergence of ( [ garfk ] ) , which yields @xmath61 .",
    "these are elliptic equations and therefore must be supplemented by boundary conditions .",
    "reasonable conditions for an asymptotically flat spacetime are @xmath62 , @xmath63 . additionally , inner boundary conditions might be required ( for instance in the case of singularity excision ) .",
    "these might be specified by newman or robin boundary conditions to enforce a @xmath64 behavior@xcite .",
    "however , further studies in this direction are needed since , other options might be better suited to ` follow ' changes in the dynamics .",
    "for instance , in the case of an orbiting system , co - rotating coordinates should simplify the simulation , and @xmath23 at the boundary must be chosen to reflect this fact .",
    "( see for instance@xcite ) .",

    "although this choice considerably simplifies the equations , the resulting coordinates tend to converge producing coordinate singularities . * harmonic slices : these are defined by @xmath67 .",
    "this option enlarges the evolution system with four extra equations and it might lead to coordinate pathologies@xcite .",

    "in particular , for @xmath73 one recovers the geodesical and harmonic slicing conditions respectively . for the case",

    "@xmath78 is chosen to be the time parameter and the equation for the slice is treated as another evolution equation .",
    "the main disadvantage is that for a stable discretization of the parabolic equation a very small timestep might be required ( to satisfy the cfl condition@xcite ) render the implementation too costly .",

    "a similar condition is obtained in@xcite slightly simplified by considering a modification of the action defined in@xcite . * _ shift conditions induced by analytical solutions : _ same as slicing condition induced from analytical solutions . * _ shift conditions tailored for dynamical variable control : _ these are conditions derived by demanding the shift vector be such that some of the dynamical variables are kept constant in time or driven to a specific value",
    ". having control on the behavior particular variables through the evolution can be extremely important .",
    "for instance , by demanding that the time derivative of a particular combination of connection coefficients be ` driven ' to zero a hyperbolic condition is obtained and the overall evolution is notably improved@xcite .",

    "spurious radiation on the initial surface should be minimized and boundary conditions to enforce appropriate asymptotic fall - off rates be defined@xcite .    additionally , when dealing with spacetimes containing singularities , special care must be exercised to handle the singularities . in practice ,",
    "either the solution is renormalized , effectively factoring out the divergent part@xcite , or a region containing the singularity is excised which requires introducing an inner boundary where data must be provided as well@xcite .",
    "+ * inner boundary conditions * + a particularly delicate issue when dealing with black hole spacetimes is the presence of singularities .",
    "clearly , a simulation will not be able to handle the infinities associated with them . in practice",
    ", one could use a slicing that effectively freezes the evolution near the singularities ( like the maximal slicing condition ) , but as discussed earlier , the simulation will not proceed for long .",
    "cosmological censorship@xcite implies that singularities must be hidden inside the event horizons .",
    "moreover , the event horizon hides anything inside it ; so , in principle , an inner boundary could be chosen to lie inside the event horizon surrounding the singularity .",
    "the presence of the inner boundary , would prevent the simulations to get ` too close ' to the singularity and the simulation should perform well .",
    "this idea , originally suggested by unruh@xcite known as _ singularity excision _ is at present the most promising strategy to deal with the singularities that might be present in the simulation .",
    "there are two basic issues in implementing this idea : + first , since the concept of event horizon is a global one , it can only be found * after * the evolution has been carried over . in order to obtain a ` local ' notion ( ie . on each hypersurface ) , in practice one looks for trapped surfaces ; in particular the outer most one which is referred to as _",
    "apparent horizon_. under certain reasonable conditions , one can prove that indeed the apparent horizon , if it exists , will always lie inside the event horizon@xcite .",
    "thus , the apparent horizon location is used as a ` marker ' and the region inside it is excised from the computational domain , defining an _ inner boundary _ which is either spacelike or null .",
    "+ the second issue , which is a delicate one , has to do with the fact that somehow values at this boundary must be prescribed .",
    "the basic strategy for this is quite simple ; since the past domain of dependence at this bounday is ` tilted ' off this boundary ( reflecting the causal structure of the spacetime interior to the event horizon ) , one could provide these values using the evolution equations .",
    "the numerical implementation of this strategy , on the other hand , is quite difficult as it must be capable of dealing with moving boundaries ( resulting from singularities moving through the grid ) ; merging of initially disconnected inner boundaries ( like those present in binary black hole spacetimes ) ; ` sudden ' appearance of inner boundaries ( which would result in collapse situation ) ; etc .",
    "an alternative way of addressing the assignment of inner boundary values is being developed by eardley@xcite .",

    "+ _ radiation boundary conditions _ + a less ` crude ' approach is to use the fact that when boundaries are placed in the radiation zone the system must describe ( neglecting backscattering ) purely outgoing waves . this in turn , can be exploited to prescribe approximate boundary conditions .",

    "+ another alternative , is to dispense of the outer boundary completely ; two options for achieving this are : cauchy - characteristic matching@xcite or the conformal field equations ( see section [ form : conformal ] ) . while the latter implies using a completely different formalism to study the spacetime ( and will be presented in detail in section [ form : conformal ] ) , the former supplements the ` 3 + 1 ' formulation with a characteristic one ( see [ form : characteristic ] ) .",
    "basically , in the region exterior to the boundary to future null infinity , one introduces a foliation along outgoing characteristics and einstein equations are written adapted to this foliation . since the phase of the ` ripples in metric ' is nearly constant along these null surfaces , penrose s compactification technique@xcite is used to deal with a finite computational domain .",

    "however , the picture does resemble the ` 3 + 1 ' approach as constraint equations limit the possible configurations of the initial data @xmath154 . as proven in@xcite ,",
    "only a subset of data need be solved , namely by solving an elliptic system for @xmath175 simple contractions on the remaining constraints yield the complete set of variables .",
    "hence , the initial data problem , at least from the elliptic system to be solved , is by no means more complicated than the one in the traditional system .",
    "in fact , it would be reasonable to assume that much of the numerical expertise gained to solve the traditional system should be ` transferable ' to the conformal approach . + * inner boundary data * + just as in the previous formulations , if the hypersurfaces contain singularities one can use singularity excision techniques to excise the singularities from the computational domain as was done for the @xmath176 scalar field collapse presented in  @xcite . another option which in fact has been the preferred one in the 3d simulations of schwarzschild spacetime@xcite",
    "has been to use slices that do not contain the singularity ; namely the foliation was chosen so that the slices cross both @xmath93s of the kruskal extension@xcite of the schwarzschild spacetime without `` hitting '' the singularities .",
    "clearly , this approach is sound and could be also used in the ` 3 + 1 ' approach ( assuming variables can be properly renormalized at @xmath91 or @xmath93 , the latter case being more or less straightforward in the conformal approach ) ; however , the simulation is making roughly twice the work ( there is no need to evolve sector iv in the notation of@xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is not clear whether a spacetime with two black holes would be amenable to such strategy since the gauge conditions will have to be carefully tuned so that the slices avoid both singularities .",
    "singularity excision would seem to be better adapted to handle more generic situations . incorporating this technique to the conformal approach",
    "should be expedited by the expertise ( being ) gained in this area in the ` 3 + 1 ' approach . +",
    "* outer boundary data * + the spacetime under study in this case is larger than the physical spacetime . as a consequence ,",
    "the outer boundary lies beyond future null infinity . at first sight",
    "it would appear awkward to set up conditions at this boundary since it is not known what boundary conditions are to be specified there .",
    "however , this need not be a problem , since @xmath93 is an incoming null surface and the space beyond @xmath93 is causally disconnected from the physical spacetime .",
    "thus , this formulation manages to get rid of the boundary problem by ` hiding ' the boundary from the region of interest .",
    "there is a price to pay for this feature , namely that the implementation spends time evolving points that are of no interest and there is therefore extra computational overhead . in principle",
    ", this can be minimized by adopting an appropriate shift conditions@xcite that keeps the location of @xmath93 at a constant coordinate value .",
    "now , suppose one has ( i ) decided for a given system of equations for a set of variables ; ( ii ) adopted suitable coordinates and/or coordinates conditions and ( iii ) defined the equations which determine the initial and boundary data and feels `` ready '' to implement ( i - iii ) numerically .",
    "the question to ask is : _ how does one proceed to obtain such implementation ? _",
    "first , a  finite \" representation of the ( continuous ) ( n-1)-dimensional hypersurfaces is obtained by defining a ( not necessarily uniform ) grid or lattice whose vertices can be labeled by a discrete set of points @xmath177 ( with @xmath178 ) .",
    "then , a finite representation for the field variables is obtained by either ( i ) representing the variable by its value at points in the grid @xmath179 or ( ii ) expanding the variable on a finite set of trial functions ; ie @xmath180 . the finite representation",
    "is then given by values of the variables themselves , @xmath181 ( case i ) or the coefficients @xmath182 ( case ii ) .",
    "these two different strategies yield , as expected , two very different approaches . _ finite difference approximations _",
    "belong to case ( i ) , while _ finite difference elements _ ; _ spectral methods _ ; _ multiquadrics _",
    ", among others , belong to case ( ii ) .",
    "irrespective of the method used , the ` end ' result is an algebraic problem , which , in the limit of infinite resolution ( ie .",
    "grid points spacing@xmath183 , for case ( i ) or @xmath184 for case ( ii ) ) the algebraic system should reduce to the original pde system .",
    "finite difference approximations ( fda ) are widely used in computational physics and are so far the most popular choice in numerical relativity .",
    "the details of this technique can be found in most numerical analysis books ( for instance  @xcite ) ; i will here comment on two important points which are not often discussed .    a finite difference approximation ( fda )",
    "entails replacing all derivatives operators by discretized counterparts .",
    "these discrete operators approximate the derivative of functions using the grid values @xmath181 and can be obtained through formal taylor expansions .",
    "there are an infinite number of combinations that a priori can be used to approximate the original system .",
    "unfortunately , the majority of these combinations result in unstable implementations .",
    "this is often reflected in the high frequency components of the solution growing without bounds . in practice , stable implementations often `` control '' this potential problem by dissipating the high frequency modes . in nonlinear systems",
    ", this proves to be very important since , even when the initial data do not contain high frequency modes , these will likely be generated by the low frequency ones .",
    "extensive analysis of dissipative schemes to obtain stable discretization of wave equations was performed by kreiss and oliger@xcite .",
    "they showed how the addition of dissipation could become crucial when treating nonlinear systems .",
    "the value of such techniques have been validated over the past fifty years since they were first proposed by von neuman and richtmeyer@xcite to solve the classical euler equations . in numerical relativity",
    "their use can be traced back to wilson s implementation of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations@xcite . in more recent times , dissipation techniques",
    "have been shown to be of great help in achieving stable discretizations in computational relativity , for instance in@xcite .",
    "additionally , the use of dissipation can play a crucial role for achieving stable discretizations for initial boundary value problems .",
    "this is highlighted in the work by oliger@xcite who considers the equation @xmath185 in the domain @xmath186 where inner boundary conditions at @xmath187 are expressed as @xmath188 with @xmath189 indicating the number of points to the right of @xmath190 involved in the scheme .",
    "for instance , a particular case of eq .",
    "( [ approxbounda ] ) would be @xmath191 oliger proved the following theorem@xcite : _ if the approximations for the initial value problem and for the approximation at the boundary ( [ approxbounda ] ) are * stable * and , further , ( [ approxbounda ] ) is * dissipative * then , the implementation of the initial boundary value problem is stable . _ + this result shows the following : ( i ) stability of the initial boundary value problem can be assessed by providing boundary conditions written in pde - like form .",
    "( ii ) the stability and dissipative properties of this equation can be readily obtained which coupled to the stability of the initial value problem provide a stable implementation .",
    "naturally , it would be desirable to have similar results tailored to the more complicated systems considered in numerical relativity .",
    "i doubt this will be achieved since the non - linearities and coupling of einstein equations make a similar analysis quite difficult .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see later in section [ evolcauchy ] , the equations are customarily recast in a form somewhat closely related to eqn .",
    "( [ 1dwave ] ) and it is important to keep this theorem in mind . the use of dissipative inner boundary conditions has not yet been generally pursued ; however , i am aware of a few systematic efforts in this direction reporting considerable improvements@xcite .",
    "the advantages gained from the use of dissipation both in the absence and presence of boundaries indicates that implementations can benefit considerably from its use . + as mentioned ,",
    "fda have been the preferred choice in numerical relativity , their ease of use ; transparent interpretation of its strategy and power certainly make them very attractive .",
    "this is illustrated by their use in all areas of numerical relativity ; ie .",
    "initial data problem , evolution and `` physics '' extraction .",
    "there are a few criticisms which have lead people into other choices ,    * appropriateness of its use on arbitrary variables : basically , when using taylor expansions up to order _",
    "n _ , one _ exactly _ accommodates for polynomials up to the n - th order .",
    "however , this might not be the ideal ` basis ' to express certain functions at particular places .",
    "for instance @xmath192 near @xmath193 is not conveniently represented by polynomials ( of positive integer ) .",
    "a solution to this problem is to reexpress variables so that they are better represented by polynomials ; thus if a given function @xmath194 is expected to behave like @xmath192 , reexpressing the equations in terms of a variable @xmath195 improves the obtained results .",
    "this technique has been used in a limited number of cases@xcite yielding excellent results .",
    "however , this approach requires some ` prior ' knowledge of the fields dependence . * awkward use at non - regular boundaries : as discussed , the variables are represented by their values at grid points ; when dealing with irregular boundaries where values and derivatives might be required , an often complicated set of interpolations must be carried out .",
    "this introduces high frequency modes which brings about all sort of nightmares .",
    "dissipation of these modes could take care of this problem but requires carefully designed algorithms . as the grid is refined , this problem might become less severe . refining a grid ( ie .",
    "adding more points to it ) increases the computational cost considerably ; however , the use of _ adaptive mesh refinement _ can help to alleviate this problem by refining the grid locally only where needed ( more on this technique in section  [ helpingnumerics ] ) .",
    "certainly , these criticisms can be addressed but , undeniably , some situations might be better handled by other methods .",
    "for instance , expansion in terms of spherical harmonics of a regular enough variable , say the electromagnetic potential of localized distribution of charges , might yield an accurate and inexpensive representation nicely adapted to a particular problem . in cases like this ,",

    "` holes ' are conveniently covered ( which is often more difficult with fda ) .",
    "additionally , if steep gradients are expected , smaller sized triangles can be used to accurately represent them .",
    "these particularly nice features come at a price , as the solution is obtained through a global minimization of the ` residual ' .",

    "however , there is an interesting ` window ' of allowed values which would enable studying astrophysically relevant systems and provide not only gravitational wave information but also enable a global description of the system ; investigate consequences of different equation of state ; influence of orbit precession on the produced gravitational wave ; etc .",

    "we would also like to understand the structure of singularities away from this limit case . studying singularities via numerical implementations",
    "is particularly difficult ; in fact singularity excision / avoidance techniques are introduced to get rid of them ! however , the promise of unraveling what einstein s equations have to tell us in the very harshest regime is certainly hard to resist .",
    "answering questions about the existence of naked singularities ; whether ` hidden ' singularities share some properties ; which character do they have ( timelike , spacelike or null ) ; etc . in generic situations",

    "what we have learned from them requires a review completely dedicated to it which goes beyond of the scope of this review . for the interested reader",
    "i suggest starting with the comprehensive review in@xcite . *",
    "* cosmology : * + even though gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces , its long range character and the impossibility to shield anything from its effects imply that general relativity plays a fundamental role governing the structure of the universe .",
    "clearly , numerical relativity has a natural place in efforts towards obtaining reliable models that can account for the observable universe .",
    "these models must be capable of describing from the strong field behavior at the big bang epoch , include a possible inflation phase , accommodate for the standard model and the complex physics involved at shortly after the big bang and follow the evolution to the late time phases corresponding to clusters of galaxies formation and large scale mass fluctuations .",
    "cosmological simulations enjoy the benefit of comparing the obtained predictions with observations , and will certainly play a fundamental role in our understanding of issues like the existence of the cosmological constant ; topology of the universe ; initial singularity ; gravitational wave interactions ; the model of structure formation ; etc . for a recent review of computational cosmology and the role of numerical relativity",
    "refer to@xcite .",
    "in the description of binary systems , some distinct phases can be recognized .",
    "the first one , is an _",
    "adiabatic _ or _ inspiraling phase _ ,",
    "where the members of the binary orbit around each other while the separation between them slowly decreases as energy is carried away by gravitational radiation .",
    "this phase can be described by means of post - newtonian@xcite or quasi - equilibrium@xcite methods .",
    "this phase ends at the inner - most stable circular orbit and a second stage , known as , _ plunge and merger phase _ takes place in which a single merged object forms ( a black hole or a neutron star ) . here , numerical simulations appear to be the only way to obtain a complete description for generic situations .",
    "the final stage is the _ ringdown phase _ where the final object settles into equilibrium ; perturbative methods ( around the expected equilibrium scenario ) can be used to describe the system .",
    "note that , since numerical relativity can in principle fully solve einstein equations , simulations could be used to model the _ complete _ problem ( ie . on all three phases ) .",
    "however , this is not feasible as the computational cost of such an enterprise would be tremendous .",
    "it is preferable to have the simulations concentrate on the plunge and merger phase and appropriately matching with the other two .",
    "achieving this ` transition ' is not a straightforward task ; several questions have to be addressed for such a task + * pre - merger . * in the case of an inspiral phase treated with post newtonian approximations , the system is described in a  point - particle \" way and the main variables are the positions , velocities and angular momentum of these `` particles '' .",
    "however , initial data for the second phase is the geometry of an initial slice which requires a proper `` translation '' . for the particular case of non - spinning black holes",
    ", alvi has presented@xcite such a translation following the method of@xcite .",
    "the metric presented in@xcite is expressed in terms of a single coordinate system valid up to the apparent horizons of the black holes ( in the co - rotating gauge suggested in@xcite ) . whether this presentation is well suited for a numerical implementation",
    "is not known as it has not yet been implemented .",
    "such an implementation will prove very valuable as it will shed light into how the matching strategy should proceed .    in the case of where the first stage is treated with quasi - equilibrium methods ,",
    "there is no need for such a translation since it directly provides the metric variables .",
    "some of the metric variables are obtained , as discussed , via a solution of the constraints while the others are provided by hand ; the main difficulty of this method is to choose these accurately . so far ,",
    "almost all methods have provided these assuming conformal flatness@xcite ( the exception being@xcite , although still restrictions on the metric are imposed ) .",
    "information obtained from post - newtonian approximations should be exploited to provide more consistent data .",
    "+ * post - merger . *",
    "the interface with the third stage is certainly more direct as in both phases the geometry is evolved .",
    "the difficulty lies in recognizing the background spacetime with respect to which the perturbations are defined . for the case of black hole spacetimes ,",
    "a useful notion is that of _ isolated horizon_@xcite which can be used to provide a rigorous and unique way to determine the parameters describing the black hole .",
    "another issue is that of gauge .",
    "namely , the gauge employed during the numerical simulation need not coincide with the one for the perturbative approach . in principle , several slices of the numerical simulation can be used to induce data on the initial hypersurface of the perturbative approach .",
    "this is not a trivial task , and will have to be analyzed in a  by - case \" basis , since , although perturbative approaches have been formulated for a few of well defined slicing conditions , numerical implementations will use different slices depending on the physical problem under consideration .",
    "still , a number of scenarios will presumably be simulated and the time spent writing this module can certainly be worthwhile .",
    "additionally , there is an extra `` added - bonus '' in handing the simulation to a perturbative approach ( aside from saving computational costs ) .",
    "the total simulation length might be ` extended ' since the full numerical implementation might suffer from instabilities generated by boundary conditions , or late time exponential modes .",
    "if already a perturbative approach can be used where the quality of the simulations at intermediate times is reasonable , the simpler perturbative approach might be capable of producing longer total simulations . a recent work by baker et .",
    "al.@xcite ( the ` lazarus approach ' ) has actually shown this can be the case .",
    "namely , they have used an adm full 3d simulation ( with maximal slicing ) to model a binary black hole system .",
    "initial data is defined with the misner solution@xcite from a fairly close separation .",
    "although the full 3d simulation crashes a relatively short time after the holes have merged , the perturbative approach is able to continue the simulation for essentially unlimited times@xcite . at least for this particular case , the combination of numerical relativity with a post - merger perturbative treatment , has simulated a binary black hole plunge all they way to the final equilibrium stage .",
    "work is underway to study astrophysically relevant scenarios , match to codes using black hole excision , accommodate more generic slicing options , etc .",
    "as the field matures and enough computational resources become available , the role of numerical simulations to understand the theory will become increasingly more important . it is hard to imagine all branches where it will be employed , but certainly in astrophysical systems , singularities , cosmology , global spacetime analysis and even quantum gravity .",
    "+ in the particular case of astrophysical systems , it is worth noting that for decades progress towards achieving astrophysically relevant simulations have proceeded in two fronts .",
    "one front concentrating efforts towards accurately evolving the geometric variables ( either assuming vacuum spacetimes or treating the matter in an approximate way ) ; the other pursuing accurate simulations of the fluid variables ( at the cost of treating problems where the geometry was considered fixed or where dynamical effects could be taken care by pseudo - newtonian approaches ) .",
    "recently , these fronts have started converging with renewed hopes for complete studies of physical situations@xcite which will provide further insight into these systems . still , present simulations do not incorporate a number of processes like neutrino transport , magneto hydrodynamics , etc .",
    "inclusion of these ingredients will greatly benefit from present simulations of systems obtained with newtonian or pseudo - newtonian models which have advanced the knowledge on how to accommodate for them ( see for instance @xcite ) . + * black holes ; neutron stars and beyond * + clearly",
    ", any system involving black holes or neutron stars can only be accurately studied by taking into account general relativity . in systems involving a single bh or ns with other much gravitationally weaker and smaller object",
    ", the latter can be reasonably well represented by a point particle following a geodesic path on the spacetime defined by the bh or ns , see for instance @xcite ( where the backreaction of the ` particle ' is accounted for by prescriptions like those presented in@xcite ) a very different treatment is needed if the system contains binaries ( bh - bh ; bh - ns ; ns - ns ) or if the single object is surrounded by a massive accretion disk .",
    "x - ray observations already predict a significant abundance of ns - ns and massive accretion disks and quite reasonable models predict a considerable number of bh - ns and bh - bh binaries@xcite .",
    "a complete study of these systems require full 3d numerical simulations , which will not only provide important insights on their gravitational wave output but also on the equation of state ( for the ns case ) ; active galactic nuclei and quasars ; formation of black holes ; models of gamma - ray bursts ( grb s ) and strong field gravity .",
    "these simulations must incorporate general relativity , neutrino processes , magnetohydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis and will certainly be quite a challenge for many years to come .",
    "however , their pay - off will make the effort very much worthwhile ; among them ,    * _ gravitational waves : _ prediction of the gravitational waves from these systems will enable deciphering the information encoded in these waves and let us understand the source system .",
    "masses , spins , equation of state , accretion rate , etc . can be readily estimated from the detected waveforms ( see for instance@xcite ) . * _ merger recoil estimation : _ in the coalescence of these strong field binaries a non - zero recoil will result from the linear momentum carried away by gravitational waves . this effect might be particularly relevant in the case of supermassive black holes believed to exist in most galaxies . when two galaxies collide ( and present models predict those at @xmath400 participated in a series of mergers!@xcite ) ; the non - zero recoil velocity could be large enough that the resulting hole be dislodged from the center of the merged galaxy .",
    "this effect would explain low - z quasars asymmetrically located in their host galaxies .",
    "even more spectacular , the recoil might result large enough to eject it out of the galaxy!@xcite . only through numerical simulations",
    "will this recoil be quantized . * _ black hole birth description : _ gamma ray bursts are for a very short time the brightest objects in the universe ( much more than the rest of the universe combined ) .",
    "this hints of extreme conditions causing them , and their understanding will tell us a great deal about gr in strong field cases .",
    "one model for grb s is that they are produced when a massive disk ( @xmath401 ) is accreted on to a bh@xcite .",
    "ns and ns - white dwarf binaries can yield precisely these kind of situations ( as could bh systems ) , thus grb s might also be signaling the birth of a black hole .",

    "being restricted to linearized perturbations , it was not clear what the ` final ' fate of these perturbed black string was .",

    "numerical investigations might provide valuable indications on spacetime properties on the large ; a rigorous analysis would demand being able to simulate the whole spacetime ; at present , it appears the conformal field ( section [ form : conformal ] ) and cauchy - characteristic matching approaches are the best suited for such a task .",
