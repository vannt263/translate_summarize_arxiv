    "if supersymmetry is to describe the real world then it must be broken at some scale @xmath3 and give rise to supersymmetry breaking mass splittings not greater than @xmath4(tev ) .",
    "the signal for local supersymmetry breaking occurs when the superpartner of the graviton , the gravitino , receives a mass via the superhiggs mechanism .",
    "there is an upper bound of @xmath5(tev ) on the gravitino mass which comes from requiring that supersymmetry provides the solution to the naturalness problem .",
    "however , the gravitino mass is not necessarily constrained to be @xmath6(tev ) because the gravitino only interacts gravitationally and so is weakly coupled ( compared to the gauge forces ) .",
    "this is not the case for the superpartners of the particles in the standard model which experience gauge forces .",
    "their soft masses are constrained from experiment to be in the range @xmath7gev .",
    "the relationship between the gravitino mass and the soft masses depends on the messenger sector .",
    "the messenger sector is responsible for communicating the spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry from a hidden sector , where the supersymmetry breaking dynamics occurs , to the observable sector .",
    "normally in hidden sector scenarios of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking , the messenger sector is gravitational and gives rise to a gravitino mass @xmath8 .",
    "a light gravitino is precluded because it would also mean light gauginos , sleptons and squarks .",
    "this typically assumes generic choices of the kahler potential , @xmath9 and the gauge kinetic function @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hidden sector chiral superfield .",
    "however , in no - scale supergravity models particular choices of @xmath9 and @xmath10 make it possible for the gravitino mass @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a hierarchy between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is also possible if the messenger sector responsible for communicating supersymmetry breaking to the visible sector is not gravitational .",
    "recently there has been a renewed interest in dynamical supersymmetry breaking models @xcite where gauge forces communicate the breakdown of supersymmetry to the squarks , sleptons and gauginos . in these models",
    "the soft masses @xmath15 are generated by radiative corrections and are proportional to the gauge couplings squared .",
    "the gauge sparticles will still receive soft masses from gravitational interactions , but these contributions are much smaller than the contributions from the gauge - mediated messenger sector .",
    "since the gravitinos do not carry gauge quantum numbers they do not receive any mass from the gauge messenger sector but still receive mass from gravitational interactions .",
    "consequently , in these models the gravitino is naturally light ( @xmath16(tev ) ) and becomes the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "this can have interesting cosmological implications , such as contributing to the dark matter component of the universe @xcite .",
    "given the possibility of non - minimal kinetic terms or a non - gravitational messenger sector one can ask how light can the gravitino mass be ?",
    "a naive estimate of this mass comes from assuming that the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath17gev , which gives @xmath18ev where @xmath19 is the planck mass .",
    "if the gravitino were this light then it would essentially behave as a massless neutrino species during nucleosynthesis .",
    "this is because at energies @xmath20 the longitudinal component of the gravitino dominates during interactions , which is just a statement of the equivalence theorem @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal components of the gravitino are the helicity @xmath21 modes which come from absorbing the spin-1/2 goldstone fermion ( or goldstino ) during the spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry .",
    "the goldstino component of the gravitino couples with a strength proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "if the gravitino mass is light this coupling can be much stronger than naively expected from the gravitational force .",
    "this means that as the temperature of the universe cools , the goldstino will remain in thermal contact with the heat bath longer because of its enhanced coupling .",
    "since the expansion rate of the universe depends on the number of degrees of freedom , the universe will expand faster with goldstinos present at temperatures @xmath24(100 mev ) and cause the neutrinos to decouple earlier .",
    "this will affect the production of neutrons ( via the charged current weak interactions ) by causing more neutrons to survive and ultimately increases the primordial @xmath0he abundance .",
    "thus the observed primordial @xmath0he abundance sets a lower bound on the gravitino mass , which in turn is related to how late the goldstino decouples from the thermal bath .",
    "a lower bound on the gravitino mass based on the nucleosynthesis argument was originally discussed by fayet @xcite , who considered the effect of the goldstino together with a light photino on the effective number of massless neutrino species .",
    "the bound derived by fayet @xmath25ev ) is not effective anymore because the photino is now believed to be of order the electroweak scale and the gravitino ( if it is light enough ) can only thermally interact with leptons and photons below the quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "more recently moroi et al @xcite have also considered this bound and obtain an estimate @xmath26ev .",
    "however the cross section used by them to recalculate the fayet bound is only valid for @xmath27 . in this work",
    "we will calculate the goldstino decoupling temperature using the cross section for goldstino annihilation in the limit @xmath28 , where we assume that the supersymmetry breaking mechanism gives rise to a superlight gravitino .",
    "the gravitino mass bound will be shown to be much weaker than has previously been estimated .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in sec.2 with a discussion of the effective interaction lagrangian for the goldstino .",

    "this will be used to calculate the goldstino decoupling temperature in sec.4 .",
    "a lower bound on the gravitino mass and the low energy supersymmetry breaking scale will be derived from the goldstino contribution to the effective number of massless neutrino species .",
