    "the nonlinear propagation of very intense pulsed bessel beams ( bbs ) has attracted a lot of attention in recent years , specially because of the ability of bbs of creating filamentary ionized channels that may be longer and more spatially controllable @xcite that the filaments created by focusing standard , gaussian - like light pulses @xcite .",
    "the versatility of bessel beams for filamentation has been dramatically demonstrated very recently with the generation of tubular plasma channels when the seeding bessel beam carries an optical vortex @xcite .",
    "these achievements have opened new perspectives in ultrafast laser material processing in transparent dielectrics , such as waveguide writing and micro- or nanomachining @xcite , or in long - range filamentation in gases with application , for instance , in microwave guiding by filaments in the atmosphere @xcite .    the first studies on bb propagation in nonlinear media date from the beginning of the past decade @xcite .",
    "nonlinear bessel beams as stationary ( non - diffracting ) solutions to the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) with kerr nonlinearity were first introduced in @xcite .",
    "nonlinear unbalanced bessel beams ( nl - ubbs ) @xcite were later found as stationary solutions of the nlse in media with kerr nonlinearity and nonlinear losses ( nlls ) , just the two key nonlinearities determining the spatial dynamics in bb filamentation .",
    "these nl - ubbs have indeed been proven to play a prominent role in the filamentation with axicon focused bbs @xcite , acting as attractors of the dynamics .",
    "matter waves of this kind can also exist in bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "more recently nl - ubbs carrying vortices have been also described @xcite , and have similarly found to act as attractors in the filamentation seeded by axicon focused vortex bbs @xcite .    in the experimental and numerical studies on nonlinear bb propagation ,",
    "two different initial conditions for the light entering the medium are usually considered . in a first arrangement ,",
    "bbs are launched into the medium when they are already formed @xcite , e. g. , an ideal bb at any transversal plane , or an apodized bb at the focus of an axicon . except",
    "if nlls dominate initially the dynamics @xcite , kerr nonlinearity induces in this case large temporal and spatial instabilities @xcite . in most of filamentation experiments with bbs @xcite and related numerical studies @xcite",
    ", the radiation exiting from the bb generator enters the nonlinear medium prior to the formation of the bb , in a state of widespread energy at low intensity levels , so that the linear bb is never formed . with an axicon , for example",
    ", the medium is placed in contact with it , or simply fills the space surrounding it , as in filamentation in gases .",
    "soft \" input condition has been proven useful to prevent the onset of large temporal instabilities in the nonlinear medium @xcite . with this arrangement , two different bessel beam propagation regimes",
    "have been observed @xcite . in a steady bessel propagation regime , the input radiation undergoes a transformation into a quasi - stationary state within the bessel zone that has been identified as a nl - ubb . in a unsteady regime , the light intensity and fluence feature periodic , quasi - periodic , even disordered spikes in the bessel zone ( and azimuthal breaking in the case of vortex bbs @xcite ) .",
    "this regime has been associated with sufficiently small cone angles and relatively low input powers so that self - focusing is the dominant nonlinearity .    in this paper",
    "we aim at providing a unified understanding of these two regimes of bb propagation under soft input conditions .",
    "we show that these two regimes are different manifestations of the same underlying dynamics .",
    "either steady or unsteady , the spatial dynamics is dominated by the existence of an attractor in the form of a specific nl - ubb .",
    "we identify the attracting nl - ubb and derive an approximate analytical expression specifying it in terms of the properties of the nonlinear medium and the light beam illuminating the axicon .",
    "however , an attractor is not necessarily a stable attractor ; its instability may lead to a richer dynamics around it , including periodic , quasi - periodic and chaotic behavior .",
    "the unsteady or steady regimes are seen to be determined by the existence or not of a small , exponentially growing unstable mode of the attracting nl - ubb . in the unsteady regime , the unstable dynamics in the bessel zone of the axicon is triggered by the unstable mode and is seen to reproduce its characteristic oscillation frequency , its development into large periodic or quasi - periodic anharmonic oscillations , or its development into chaotic oscillations , depending on the gain of the small unstable mode .",
    "although the unsteady bessel filamentation regime has been previously suggested to be associated with nl - ubb instability @xcite , it is only the identification of the attracting nl - ubb that have allowed us to analyze its stability properties , and hence to verify that hypothesis , putting it in quantitative terms .    for simplicity",
    "we focus on bbs generated by axicons in most of the numerical simulations , but the same results are seen to hold for other soft input conditions that would generated bbs in linear propagation .",
    "we illustrate the results in air at 800 nm , in which case the characteristic angles separating the different regimes are quite small , but we have verified that the same results hold at larger angles ( but still paraxial ) in condensed media .",
    "we consider diffraction , kerr nonlinearity and nlls as the key effects determining the propagation of the light beam coming from the bb generator . in the paraxial approximation ,",
    "the envelope @xmath0 of the light beam @xmath1 of frequency @xmath2 and propagation constant @xmath3 , is then suitably described by the nlse @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the linear and nonlinear refractive indexes and the @xmath8-photon absorption coefficient . for the initial conditions of interest , and according to @xcite ,",

    "the connection between unsteady bessel propagation regime and instability of the attracting nl - ubb is clearer in situations of higher gain . for two nl - ubbs with increasing gain , fig . [",

    "these small modes develop into large , periodic ( but no longer harmonic ) perturbation regimes , that gradually turn into quasi - periodic , and eventually into chaos . in all cases",
    "we have studied , this process is found to be faster as the gain @xmath118 triggering this process is higher . also , the oscillation frequency in the large , periodic perturbation regime is close to but slightly lower than @xmath119 . in simulations as those of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , nl - ubbs are directly launched into the medium and the dominant , unstable modes of each nl - ubb are found to emerge spontaneously from numerical noise with the gain and oscillation frequency predicted by the linearized instability analysis [ left part in figs .",
    "[ fig6](a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "to simulate the propagation of ideal , non - truncated nl - ubbs , we use the procedure of replacing the propagated field at each axial numerical step of propagation with the initial nl - ubb in a narrow annulus touching the end of the ( quite large ) numerical radial grid .",
    "this procedure is justified since no dynamics is expected to take place in the linear asymptotic tails . in figs .",
    "[ fig6](c - f ) , phase spaces @xmath130@xmath131 ( @xmath130 on - axis intensity ) in relevant propagation intervals are shown . in the case of lower gain ,",
    "the large perturbation regime remains periodic for a considerable propagation distance [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) ] , whereas in the case of higher gain , it becomes quasi - periodic from the beginning of the large perturbation regime [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](d ) ] and enters sooner into chaos .",

    "small differences originate from the slow decay of intensity along the bessel zone of the finite - power bb .",

    "[ fig6](f ) evidences that the dynamics after the axicon is reproducing the chaotic dynamics about the ideal nl - ubb chaotic attractor .",
    "from a series of diagnostic numerical simulations , we have extracted the underlying laws governing the spatial dynamics of the light beam emerging from an axicon , and entering a medium where self - focusing kerr effect and multiphoton absorption are relevant .",
    "if as pointed out , temporal and plasma effects play a secondary role in determining the spatial dynamics in filamentation with bbs , these laws provide an unified understanding of the different bessel filamentation regimes described previously . in a few words ,",
    "the nonlinear propagation is determined by an attracting nl - ubb and its stability properties under small perturbations .",
    "the attracting nl - ubb is that whose inward hnkel amplitude equals the amplitude of the bb that the bb generator would create at the center of the bessel zone in linear propagation .",
    "we have derived an approximate analytical expression that determines the attracting nl - ubb given the optical properties of the medium , the cone angle , and the intensity of the linear bb ( or equivalently , the axicon base angle and the input gaussian width and intensity ) .",
    "steady / unsteady propagation regimes are shown to correspond to stability / instability of the attracting nl - ubb under small radial perturbations , i. e. , to the existence of a small unstable radial mode that tends to grow exponentially .",
    "we have performed an extensive stability analysis under small radial perturbations that put in quantitative terms the stabilization effect of increasing the cone angle and the intensity . in case of instability under small perturbations , nl - ubbs",
    "are seen to develop a large perturbation and chaotic regimes with increasing propagation distances . in the bessel zone after the axicon , and depending on how large the gain of the small unstable mode of the attracting nl - ubb is , the unsteady dynamics reproduces the dynamics of the small perturbation , large , or chaotic perturbation regimes of the attracting nl - ubb .",
    "though a direct relation with increasing gain is obvious , further research would be needed to specify in more quantitative terms the particular perturbation regime ( small , large or chaotic ) of the attracting nl - ubb that is observed in the bessel zone .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to vortex - less nl - ubbs , but the generality of these ideas suggests a relatively simple generalization to axicon - generated vortex nl - ubb , in which case not only radial instability but also azimuthal instability should be taken into account .",
