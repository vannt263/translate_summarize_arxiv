    "simultaneously , a new optical outburst from  was reported ( masetti & soria 2000 ; jain & bailyn 2000 ) .",
    "in this paper we report atca observations of the radio counterpart of , together with daily x - ray observations performed during the 2000 outburst with rxte / asm and cgro / batse .",
    "these observations have been performed in different x - ray states and we discuss the relation of radio emission within these states .",
    "the asm on - board _ rxte _ ( levine et al .",
    "1996 ) monitors the activity in soft x - rays of any source in the sky in three energy bands ( 1.53 , 35 , 512  kev ) .",
    "the asm light - curve in the energy band 1.512 kev is presented in the top panel of figure  1 and in the lower panel , we plot the hardness ratio ( 512  kev/35  kev ) using one - day averages .",
    "the 20100 kev light - curve , obtained with batse on - board _ cgro _ using an earth occultation technique ( harmon et al .",
    "1992 ) , is presented in the middle panel of figure  1 .",
    "a power law model with a variable spectral index has been folded through the batse response matrix for daily flux calculation . due to precession of",
    "the _ cgro _ orbit ,  stopped being occulted on mjd 51682 , a few days before the end of the _ cgro _ mission .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the soft and hard x - ray behavior of  during the 2000 x - ray outburst . during the initial rise ,",
    "the soft x - ray flux increased slowly , whereas the hard x - ray flux was already strong when the orbital configuration of _ cgro _ allowed its detection by batse .",
    "on april 26 ( mjd 51660 ) , we note a rapid increase in soft x - rays as well as a decrease in hard x - rays , which then settled down in a plateau until the termination of _ cgro_. the decay of this outburst was a gradual decline in soft x - rays .",
    "analysis of the rxte / asm hardness ratio curve and rxte / pca data ( miller et al . in prep ) allowed us to divide the outburst into three different parts .",
    "the outburst started and finished with a hard spectrum , whereas the central part was soft , but with detectable hard x - ray emission .",
    "this can be understood as follows : an initial low hard state followed by a transition to the intermediate state ( or very high state , as this state is now recognized as a higher count rate version of the intermediate state , see homan et al .",
    "2001 ) on april 26 and then a return to the low hard state after may 13 ( mjd 51677 ) .",
    "preliminary analysis of rxte / pca observations confirm a change in power - law photon index from 2.30 to 1.74 between may 16 and may 24 ( tomsick et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "we note that sxts are rarely observed in the low hard state in the rising phase of their outbursts .",
    "it is interesting to note that this new x - ray outburst occurred less than a year after the discovery outburst which took place from 1998 september to 1999 may . before that , was believed to be in quiescence .",
    "this renewed activity is unusual for sxts with long recurrence time (  probably belongs to this class , as it has never been detected in the past years despite sensitive surveys of the galactic plane ) .",
    "a parallel can be drawn with  which also had a new outburst a few months after the end of series of outbursts and a period of quiescence ( e.g.  hameury et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "we should also note that both systems have relatively long orbital periods : 2.6 day for  ( bailyn et al .",
    "1995 ) and 1.5 day for  ( jain et al .",
    "the spectral type ( f3f6 ) of its stellar companion ( orosz and bailyn 1997 ) and its peculiar position in the hertzsprung gap ( kolb et al .",
    "1997 ) may be responsible for the recurrent outbursts of  ( but see regs , tout , & wickramasinghe 1998 for alternative explanations ) .",
    "the spectral type of the secondary in  has not been identified yet but photometric data are consistent with a low mass k0k5 star ( snchez - fernndez et al .",
    "its precise determination would be of great interest to understand these sxts with repeated outbursts .",
    "if  does have a k - type optical companion , it must be evolved to be large enough to fill its roche lobe .",
    "an evolved companion could conceivably be the similarity that is responsible for the repeated outbursts from these systems .",
    "the radio continuum observations of  were carried out using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , located in narrabri , nsw , australia .",
    "the atca is a synthesis telescope consisting of 6 antennae , each of 22 m diameter , aligned on a 6 km east - west array .",
    "the atca radio observations have been conducted on three different dates in 2000 : april 30 , may 6 and june 1 .",
    "the first two observations were performed in the 0.750d compact configuration , while the last observation was carried out in the high spatial resolution 6b array .",
    "the first and third observations were made at the central frequencies of 1384 , 2496 , 4800 , and 8640 mhz , with a total bandwidth of 128 mhz ; observations were made at only 4800 and 8640 mhz during the second observation .",
    "the amplitude and bandpass calibrator was pks  b1934@xmath2638 and the antennae gain and phase calibration was derived from regular observations ( every 20 minutes ) of the point source calibrators b1554@xmath264 ( at 4800 and 8640 mhz ) and b1549@xmath2790 ( at 1384 and 2496 mhz ) .",
    "the editing , calibration , fourier transformation , deconvolution and image analysis were performed using the miriad package ( sault , teuben , & wright 1995 ) . due to the proximity of a very strong ( @xmath1 145 jy at 1 ghz ) supernova remnant ( g326.3@xmath21.8 ) close to the field of view",
    ", the shortest baselines have not been used in the analysis of the data at 1384 and 2496 mhz .",
    "the atca flux densities of  are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "the first atca observation ( on mjd 51665 ) allows a detection of the radio counterpart at a weak level of 7.45 @xmath0 0.12 mjy and 5.68 @xmath0 0.06 mjy at 4800 and 8640 mhz respectively . for a flux density s@xmath3",
    "@xmath4 @xmath5 , a spectral index of @xmath6 = 0.46 @xmath0 0.05 is derived . before this first atca observation ,",
    "the most performed several observations while  was in its initial low hard state and detected it at a level of 815 mjy at 843 mhz .",
    "the second atca observations performed during the intermediate / very high state ( on mjd 51670 ) did not reveal significant radio emission from  with a strong 3 @xmath7 upper limit of 0.15 mjy at 8640 mhz .",
    "after a transition back to the low hard state , we performed our third atca observation ( on mjd 51697 ) at nearly the end of the x - ray outburst .",
    "radio emission is again detected at a level of @xmath1 1 mjy at all four frequencies .",
    "the spectrum is slightly inverted with a spectral index of 0.37 @xmath0 0.10 ( figure 2a ) .",
    "the best position of the radio counterpart is : @xmath6(j2000 ) = 15@xmath850@xmath958.7@xmath10 and @xmath11(j2000 ) = 562835.2 with a total uncertainty of 0.3 ; it is consistent with the position of the optical counterpart ( jain et al .",
    "the detection ( on june 1st ) of a radio source with an inverted spectrum ( spectral index of 0.37 @xmath0 0.10 ) , while  was in the low hard state , is reminiscent of the behavior of the few other bhcs ( transient or persistent ) which have been observed at radio frequencies in the low hard state .",
    "indeed , the persistent bhcs from our galaxy   ( brocksopp et al . 1999 ) ,  ( corbel et al . 2000 ) and  ( lin et al . 2000 ) are found most of the time in the low hard hard state and are detected in radio with a flat ( spectral index @xmath1 0.0 ) or inverted spectrum ( and also probably e ) . among the sxts , we should note that gs  2023@xmath12338 ( han & hjellming 1992 ) , gro  j0422@xmath1232 ( shrader et al .",
    "1994 ) , gs  1354@xmath264 ( brocksopp et al . 2001 ) and xte  j1118@xmath12480 ( hynes et al . 2000 , fender et al .",
    "2001a ) have been detected with similar properties ( see discussion in fender 2001b ) .",
    "should now be added to this list .",
    "a flat or inverted radio spectrum can be interpreted as optically thick synchrotron emission from a compact and conical jet following the model of hjellming & johnston ( 1988 ) . in this model ,",
    "the higher frequencies come from the base of the compact jet where the optical depth is the highest .",
    "low frequency radio emission arises from the region further from the base . summing all contributions over the spatial extent of the jet results in a flat or inverted spectrum .",
    "recent vlba imaging of a compact jet in the radio core of  ( stirling et al . 2001 ) confirms this interpretation .",
    "also the stronger orbital modulation of the higher frequencies favors this scenario ( pooley , fender , & brocksopp 1999 ) .",
    "the physical size of these compact jets is believed to be of the order of @xmath1 10 a.u at 8.6 ghz .",
    "( corresponding to the m.a.s angular scale ) .",
    "more vlba observations of bhc in the low hard state should increase the number of compact jet detections .",
    "it is expected that the flat spectrum must cut off at high frequency .",
    "the spectrum of  is flat up to 220 ghz ( fender et al .",
    "but in the case of  ( corbel & fender in prep . ) and xte  j1118@xmath12480 ( hynes et al . 2000 , fender et al .",
    "2001a ) , the inverted radio spectrum probably extends up to the near - infrared range . in figure 2b",
    ", we show the simultaneous radio and optical observations of  taken on 2000 june 1 ( see jain et al . 1999 , 2001 for a discussion of the yalo data ) .",
    "is detected at v = 18.9 @xmath0 0.1 mag .",
    "and i = 16.7 @xmath0 0.1 mag .",
    "an optical extinction of a@xmath13 = 2.2 @xmath0 0.3 mag .",
    "( snchez - fernndez et al .",
    "1999 ) has been used to deredden these data . considering the uncertainties in the optical extinction , the spectral index between the two optical bands ( 2.6 @xmath0 1.0 ) appears to be non - thermal and is not compatible with the thermal spectrum of an optically thick accretion disk ( spectral index @xmath14 + 0.3 in the optical range ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that a significant fraction of the optical - near ir emission in  during the low hard state is ( optically thin ) synchrotron emission from the compact jet .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , the cut - off frequency lies in the near infrared range ( as in  and xte  j1118@xmath12480 ) .    using the june 1 observations ,",
    "the radio luminosity ( 110 ghz band ) of the compact jet is @xmath1 7@xmath1510@xmath16 for a distance of 2.5 kpc .",
    "the luminosity of the compact jet in the radio band during the first part of the outburst may be an order of magnitude higher , as  was detected at a level of 815 mjy at 843 mhz with the most .",
    "assuming that the inverted spectrum extends to the near infrared ( @xmath17 hz ) , as discussed above , we find that the total radiative luminosity of the compact jet would be of order @xmath1 2@xmath15@xmath18 for the june  1 observation , several per cent of the 2 - 20 kev band x - ray luminosity of 5@xmath15@xmath19 measured on the same day ( tomsick et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "furthermore , taking account of internal energy of particles within the jet and relativistic bulk motion is likely to increase the total power required to energize the jet ( a precise estimate would require the knowledge of the inclination angle of the jet ) .",
    "thus , the compact jet is likely very powerful with a total power close to the bolometric luminosity of the system ( accretion disk and corona ) .",
    "the first atca observation was performed five days after the transition from the low hard state to the intermediate / very high state .",
    "is detected around @xmath1 6 mjy but contrary to the low hard state , the radio spectrum has a spectral index of 0.46 @xmath0 0.05 , indicative of optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "it is likely that this optically thin emission is due to a discrete ejection of relativistic plasma at the time of the state transition when the accretion disk is unstable .",
    "we would then be detecting the decaying radio emission from this event and the emission from near  would be low , consistent with our non - detection of radio emission later in the intermediate / very high state . during the second part of the 1998 - 99 x - ray outburst , homan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also reported an optically thin synchrotron event after a state transition .",
    "similar discrete ejection events have been inferred during state transitions in  ( corbel et al .",
    "it is possible that almost all x - ray binaries ( including neutron star systems ) produce similar weak radio events during state transitions ( see also hjellming & han 1995 and recent work by fender & kuulkers 2001c ) .",
    "we note that it was hypothesized that the transition to the very high state was accompanied by massive superluminal ejections ( fender 2000b ) and bright flaring radio events .",
    "these new atca observations rule out such an interpretation as no bright ejection event was observed .",
    "the formation of these superluminal ejection events might possibly require a transition from a quiescent state to a very high state , i.e. a large and rapid increase of the mass accretion rate and not a transition from a state where significant accretion is already occurring ( such as the low hard state ) .",
    "indeed , the discovery outburst of was a transition from quiescence to a very high state .",
    "a bright radio event was detected after the transition and possibly resolved in two components moving at apparent superluminal velocities ( hannikainen et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the second atca observation was performed when  was in the intermediate / very high state . at that time ,  was not detected with atca at 4800 and 8640 mhz , with a 3 @xmath7 upper limit of 0.15 mjy at 8640 mhz , i.e. a reduction of radio emission by a factor greater than 50 if we take into account the most detection in the initial low hard state .",
    "this is the first time radio observations of a bhc have been performed during an intermediate ( or very high ) state .",
    "radio observations in this state are particularly important because usually the radio emission is dominated by the decaying optically thin synchrotron emission associated with the quiescent / active state transition ( and therefore decoupled from the bh / disk system ) ; here , we view the intrinsic radio properties of the system in this state .    this non - detection is similar to the quenching of the compact jet of during the 1998 high soft state ( fender et al .",
    "1999 ) . following the discussion in fender et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , it indicates that the compact jet is probably physically suppressed in the intermediate state .",
    "these new constraints lead us to conclude that from a radio point of view the intermediate ( or very high ) and high soft states are identical .",
    "we should note that belloni et al .",
    "( 1999 ) classified the 1996 outburst of  as an intermediate state .",
    "at that time , radio observations ( only performed at the end of the intermediate state when  was returning to its standard low hard state ) revealed an increase of radio emission ( zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) , and probably indicating that the radio emission was indeed lower in the intermediate state , as observed here in .    in the low hard state",
    ", there is a strong coupling between the compact jet and the luminosity of the corona ( see brocksopp et al .",
    "1999 for  and corbel et al . 2000 for ) .",
    "despite the fact that the intermediate state has significant hard x - ray emission , it is not a sufficient condition to sustain the emission from the compact jet ( the power law index is different between the low hard state and the intermediate / very high state , but the hard x - ray emission is currently believed to originate from the corona in both states ) .",
    "therefore , the low hard state does produces radio emission via a compact jet , whereas the states with a stronger soft component ( high soft and intermediate / very high ) lead to the quenching of these compact jets for a reason which is not understood .",
    "evaporation processes in the standard geometrically thin disk , below a certain accretion rate , may possibly lead to coronal outflows ( e.g. meyer , liu , & meyer - hofmeister 2000 ) .",
    "it is also possible that high magnetic energy dissipation might be responsible for the formation of outflows ( and therefore a compact jet above the corona ) in the low hard state , whereas the soft states would be dominated by viscous energy dissipation in the accretion disk ( e.g. beloborodov 1999 ; poutanen 1999 ; di matteo , celotti , & fabian 1999 ) .",
    "radio emission has been detected from  on two occasions during its 2000 outburst . like other bhcs , observed ( too rarely ) in the low hard state , the radio spectrum of  is inverted .",
    "this likely implies that the radio emission is synchrotron emission from a compact jet .",
    "the total power in the compact jet may be a significant fraction of the total accretion luminosity . the intermediate / very high state ( like the high soft state of ) is characterized by a quenching of this compact jet .",
    "it appears that low hard states in bhcs produce compact outflows , whereas the states with a strong soft component from the accretion disk leads to suppression of a radio emitting outflow .",
    "state transitions are accompanied with discrete ejection of relativistic plasma .",
    "more multiwavelength observations of bhcs in the low hard state are needed in order to understand the physics of these compact jets .",
