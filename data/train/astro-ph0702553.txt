    "alternatively , the outflowing gas may be  transient \" , in the form of clouds or filaments passing through the line of sight .",
    "a variety of distinct ionisation stages , seemingly unrelated to the ionising flux , could be then accounted for .",

    ".      some of the gas components detected in the x - rays might also absorb in the uv band . in the hst spectrum of , obtained in 1994 @xcite , the presence of  and  absorption features with an outflow velocity of @xmath65 , clearly highlighted the presence of a warm absorber .",
    "unfortunately the column densities of the absorption troughs were poorly determined in the hst spectrum : @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "the @xmath42 x - ray components have values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 which are compatible with the uv column densities . also the asca column density measurements are consistent with the uv values , while the @xmath51 components clearly do not produce enough of these low - ionisation ions .",
    "interestingly , the uv flux in 1994 was about four times higher than in 02 and 05 .",
    "this at least suggests that a low ionisation outflowing component may survive years , despite large changes in the uv flux ( and presumably of the overall level of the sed ) .",
    "the uv total hydrogen column density is slightly lower than for the x - ray absorbers ( fig .",
    "[ f : uv ] ) .",
    "the outflow velocity measured from the x - ray spectra is consistent with the value found in the hst - fos spectrum .",

    "the vertical dashed line marks the blue - shift as measured from the uv  line ( 1870 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the outflow velocity of the uv - x - ray gas did not change in time , within uncertainties .",
    "this suggests that we are observing a gas not dramatically influenced by changes of the central source ( e.g. changes in the acceleration of the flow , or strong variability of the source )",
    ". therefore the observed gas may be in the terminal - velocity portion of the flow , at a considerable distance from the central source , for example at a parsec scale , produced either by evaporation in a molecular torus @xcite , or by instabilities of the outer rim of the accretion disc , which in principle can extend to large distances . as a note of caution ,",
    "the comparison between the x - ray and the uv absorbers discussed here is based on non - simultaneous data , which may be misleading @xcite .",
    "in addition , the uv information given by hst gives only partial information on the sed , which would be important for an unambiguous comparison between the uv and x - ray bands .",
    "we have presented the  low - energy x - ray data of , collected in 2005 . in the absorbed spectrum we find evidence of a neutral phase , stable at least over the last ten years and probably associated with the host galaxy or with the interaction stream to the companion galaxy of  (",
    "see also paper  i ) .",
    "in addition , two ionised absorption components with similar column densities of @xmath71@xmath1 and ionisation parameters @xmath72 are detected . comparing these results with a previous  observation and archival asca and hst data",
    "we conclude :    * the two ionised gas components detected in both 05 and 02 can not be in pressure equilibrium with each other .",
    "for the two components to coexist , a different mechanism , like magnetic confinement and/or gas shielding has to play a role . *",
    "the x - ray ionisation parameter @xmath4 is clearly anti - correlated with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "a viable explanation for this considers a gas organised in filaments crossing the line of sight .",
    "however the similarity of the column densities of the @xmath42 , @xmath51 components and also of the gas detected in the asca spectrum , make this possibility not as clear as for other cases ( e.g. ngc  4151 , * ? ? ?",
    "other possibilities , like a non - equilibrium state of the absorber , would need continuous monitoring to be rigorously tested .",
    "finally , we may think that the observed gas might be shielded from the continuum source in the context of a complex and turbulent gas environment and experience a filtered ionising flux .",
    "* the gas producing the x - ray lower ionisation absorbers detected in 02 and 05 can also produce the low - ionisation species (  and ) seen in the hst spectrum @xcite , as the column densities and outflow velocities are consistent .",
    "interestingly however , the uv absorber was observed when the uv flux was about 4 times higher than the ones recorded by -om .",
    "this shows that a low ionisation component can survive for at least ten years , despite significant variations in the uv flux .",
    "the constant outflow velocity of the uv and the x - ray absorbers in time suggests also that we are observing the terminal velocity portion of the gas , probably located at a large distance from the source .",

    "<S> we present a spectral analysis of the narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxy i  zwicky1 , focusing on the characteristics of the ionised absorbers as observed with  in 2005 . </S>",
    "<S> the soft x - ray spectrum shows absorption by two components of ionised gas with a similar column density ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) and ionisation parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 . comparing this observation with a 2002  data set , we see a clear anti - correlation between the x - ray ionisation parameter @xmath4 and the @xmath5kev luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> viable explanations for this effect include transient clouds or filaments crossing the line of sight in a complex geometry or a gas observed in non - equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow velocity of the x - ray low - ionisation absorber is consistent with the outflow of the uv absorber detected in a past hubble space telescope observation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the ionic column densities of  and  derived from the x - ray model are consistent with the uv values . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the low - ionisation outflowing gas may survive for many years , despite large changes in flux , and that there is a tight connection between the x - ray and uv absorbers that can only be confirmed with a simultaneous uv and x - ray observation .    </S>",
