    "<S> the velocity of polaron migration in the long poly - dna chain ( @xmath040 base pairs ) in an applied electric field has been studied within a polaron model . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the polaron velocity strongly depends on the polaron size . </S>",
    "<S> a small polaron shows a slow propagation and strong tolerance to the electric field , while a large polaron is much faster and less stable with increasing electric field . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the conductance of the dna molecule within the polaron model is found to be sensitive to structural disorders in the dna geometry , but that dependence diminishes with increasing temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1.5truecm    the application of the biological systems in developing nanoelectronic devices has been recognized as one of the most intriguing and promising techniques in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the molecular recognition and self - assembly properties that allows them to perform reparation of the damaged structures by the non - invasive technology and self - incorporation of molecular blocks into the well - structured systems . </S>",
    "<S> the dna molecule is one such biological system . </S>",
    "<S> the interest on dna , while originally derived as it is the source of genetic information , has been significantly elevated due to the discovery of dna conductance .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding the mechanism of charge migration in a complex molecule such as dna is a difficult problem . </S>",
    "<S> just as in the field of condensed matter , in simple dna sequences , if the donor and the acceptor are separated by a single potential barrier , the charge transfer has been adequately explained by the competition of quantum tunneling and incoherent hopping @xcite that has also been experimentally confirmed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed conductance of long dna molecule with both poly- and mixed sequences , varies from insulator to a metallic behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , the results for the decrease of conductance with decreasing temperature has been somewhat contradictory @xcite . for the description of transport phenomena in polymer chains , </S>",
    "<S> a polaron model has been known to be very successful @xcite . for dna , </S>",
    "<S> this model has shown recently to provide promising results as well , especially for explaining the temperature dependence of the dna conductance @xcite . moreover , additional advantage of the polaron model , in comparison to the popular models such as the tight - binding approach or the system of kinetic equations , is that it includes the interaction of the migrating charge with the dna lattice .    in this paper , we have used the polaron model for simulation of the dynamics of hole propagation in the dry poly - dna molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the most probable reasons for variation of the dna conductance in different experiments @xcite can be due to , ( i ) different external and internal conditions that can change formations of large polarons to smaller ones , thereby decreasing the conductance . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) chains due to different parameters for charge propagation should show different conductance behavior , as indicated in the experiment @xcite ; ( ii ) even a small disorder in the dna structure can trap the polaron , again resulting in a decrease of the conductance . </S>",
    "<S> however , a disorder - free dna structure shows a constant velocity of polaron propagation in a constant electric field , which gradually increases with increasing electric field .    </S>",
    "<S> we have simulated the polaron propagation through dna using the peyrard - bishop - holstein ( pbh ) model , which combines a quantum - mechanical treatment of charge motion with a classical treatment of the lattice distortion dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> application of this model , which describes the charge tunneling from one dna base site to another , is however limited to low temperatures . to avoid the temperature restriction we have investigated the poly - dna molecule . in a poly - chain , </S>",
    "<S> each strand contains only one base type . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , due to the large difference of ionization potential between the purine and pyrimidine bases ( @xmath1 1.0 ev @xcite ) belonging to the opposite strands , the main mechanism of charge migration at low and at room temperature is longitudinal one - dimensional tunneling along a single strand containing purine bases .    </S>",
    "<S> an electric field is applied to the system using the method of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , specifically , the charge transfer integral @xmath2 is multiplied by a complex exponential phase factor that includes the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath3 . for a uniform constant electric field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 , we take @xmath5 , thereby satisfying @xmath6 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath7 is the speed of light , and we have taken @xmath3=0 at time @xmath8=0 . the uniform electric field is included via its uniform vector potential , rather than with its non - uniform scalar potential @xcite , in order that periodic boundary conditions can be utilized .    with the modifications for the electric field , the coupled system of non - linear equations based on the pbh model is @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the probability amplitude for the charge on the @xmath12-th base pair </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath2 is the nearest - neighbor transfer integral between the base pairs , @xmath13 is the charge - vibrational coupling constant , @xmath14 is the on - site energy for base site @xmath12 , @xmath15 is the amount by which the @xmath12-th base site is displaced from its equilibrium position , @xmath16 is the polaron mass on the single site , @xmath17 is the friction parameter , @xmath18 is the morse potential , and @xmath19 is the interaction of neighboring stacked base - pairs , @xmath20 is the electronic charge , and @xmath21 is the interbase spacing ( @xmath21=3.4 ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , and throughout this paper we take @xmath23 ps@xmath24 . in poly - dna , </S>",

    "<S> and the lattice displacement @xmath15 propagating through poly - dna for @xmath4=0.016  mv / (@xmath13=0.6  ev /  , @xmath2=0.1  ev , @xmath16=300  amu).,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    in our simulations , a polaron is initially created by solving the system of nonlinear equations  ( [ eq : schrod ] ) and  ( [ eq : newton ] ) in a stationary situation ( i.e. , for @xmath25 and @xmath26 constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> initial estimates for @xmath15 and @xmath11 are chosen to be nonzero only for ten consecutive base pairs . due to the uniformity and stability of the system , </S>",
    "<S> the solution is largely insensitive to the initial estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting initial solution can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : moving ] for @xmath27 ps . the lattice displacement @xmath15 and the charge density @xmath28 coincide and </S>",
    "<S> have the same overall shape . </S>",
    "<S> together they comprise a polaron that , for the parameters chosen here , is spread over approximately thirteen lattice sites but has a definite peak in the center . in the polaron s vicinity , </S>",
    "<S> the displacement @xmath15 , and therefore the distortion energy @xmath29 , are negative , creating a quantum well in the otherwise uniform energy profile of the poly - dna . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function @xmath11 is consequently localized within this well and the polaron is stable against small perturbations . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> if no electric field is applied ( @xmath4=0 ) , the polaron remains completely stationary because the initial solution corresponds to a stable equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> in an electric field the positively charged polaron moves in the direction of the field ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : moving ] ) for a constant electric field of @xmath4=0.016  mv /  . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , as the polaron migrates both the charge density and lattice displacement move in unison , i.e. , the wave function and its formed quantum well travel together . </S>",
    "<S> because of the stabilizing effect of the lattice distortion , the polaron retains the same overall shape as it migrates ; however , our calculations indicate that in larger electric fields , the polaron becomes slightly more localized over time .    in the following , we study polaron shape and propagation in poly - dna under the influence of an electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we focus specifically on the effect of three physical parameters , @xmath13 , @xmath2 , and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the charge - vibrational coupling constant @xmath13 determines the decrease in on - site energy in the charged - state geometry , and has been estimated theoretically to be in the range of 0.3 - 1.5  ev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its value predominantly depends on the nature of the state geometry and its extension , which can be influenced by the structural parameters of dna and the solvent environment as well . </S>",
    "<S> the charge in dna can be spread in two direction : in parallel to the propagation pathway  longitudinal direction and perpendicular  transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> the spreading of the charge in the longitudinal direction significantly decreases @xmath13 @xcite . for the transverse case , a charge can occupy a single purine base that suggests a larger value of @xmath13 than does a charge that is partially delocalized over a base pair @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of charge delocalization also governs the value of the polaron mass @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> if the charge is localized on a single base then @xmath30150  amu , and this value increases with extension of the geometry of the state in the transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the charge transfer integral @xmath2 depends strongly on the configuration of the dna geometry , and can be influenced by the solvent environment as well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical estimations place the value of @xmath2 in the range of 0.05 @xmath31 0.3  ev @xcite , while experiments indicate the value of @xmath2 to be @xmath320.01  ev @xcite . throughout this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we use the values @xmath13=0.6  ev /  , @xmath2=0.1  ev , and @xmath16=300  amu as reference points , and consider the effects of deviating from these values as we study polaron shape and polaron response to applied electric fields .     and ( b ) v. in ( a ) , @xmath2=0.1  ev , @xmath16=300  amu , and @xmath13 is given in units of ev /  . in ( b ) , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13=0.6  ev /  , @xmath16=300  amu , and @xmath2 is given in units of ev.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    the uniform system used in our simulations is ideal for studying the effect of model parameters on polaron shape since , as mentioned above , the polaron remains stationary in the absence of an electric field . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : shapes](a ) shows the effect of changing the coupling constant @xmath13 under these circumstances . as is evident in the figure , increasing @xmath13 results in greater polaron localization : the polaron occupies fewer lattice sites , with a correspondingly larger charge density and lattice distortion at the center of the polaron . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , decreasing @xmath13 has the opposite effect . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : shapes](b ) shows the shape of the polaron at varying values of the charge transfer integral @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is opposite to that observed when adjusting @xmath13 : increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath2 causes a decrease ( increase ) in polaron localization . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected since the larger the charge transfer integral , the more the polaron will spread out to neighboring sites . in accordance with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : newton ] ) , the value of @xmath16 has no effect on the polaron s shape : in the stationary state the time derivative @xmath33 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : newton ] ) equals zero .    </S>",
    "<S> after the polaron is initially created , a constant uniform electric field @xmath4 is applied and we study the resulting polaron motion in time . </S>",
    "<S> simulations show that there exists a maximum electric field @xmath34 that the polaron can tolerate ; for @xmath35 , the lattice displacement and charge density become unsynchronized and irregular . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath34 depends on the system s parameters and in all cases studied , the more delocalized the polaron the smaller the value of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> as such , increasing @xmath13 or decreasing @xmath2 leads to a polaron capable of tolerating larger fields , whereas @xmath34 is mostly independent of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> a highly localized polaron causes a large localized lattice distortion , which effectively acts as a quantum well . by decreasing the energy in its vicinity , </S>",
    "<S> a more localized polaron is therefore more stable , and consequently , it is reasonable that the polaron would be able to remain well - formed in the presence of stronger electric fields .    the application of an electric field effects polaron migration ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : moving ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , provided that @xmath36 , the polaron remains well - formed and the motion is continuous . </S>",
    "<S> further , in the presence of a field the polaron moves at a constant velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be explained as follows : ( i ) our system represents poly - dna under periodic boundary conditions , so the system parameters do not vary with location ; ( ii ) the applied electric field is uniform and constant ; ( iii ) the polaron maintains a constant shape as it travels ; and ( iv ) the friction term @xmath33 prevents the charge from continually accelerating . </S>",
    "<S> these factors ensure that after a brief period of acceleration from the initial stationary state , the polaron s velocity does not vary .    , </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath2 , and ( c ) @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> points corresponding to @xmath37 are absent as they do not represent accurate values . </S>",
    "<S> unless specified otherwise in the figure , @xmath13=0.6  ev /  , @xmath2=0.1  ev , and @xmath16=300  amu.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    the velocity does depend , however , on the system parameters and on the applied electric field strength . figures  [ fig : velocities](a ) ,  [ fig : velocities](b ) , and  [ fig : velocities](c ) show how the velocity of the polaron varies with @xmath4 for different values of @xmath13 , @xmath2 , and @xmath16 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these graphs all display a similar behavior , but the magnitudes and slopes in the plots are very sensitive to the values of @xmath13 , @xmath2 , and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an increase in the velocity @xmath31 and therefore conductance @xmath31 can be achieved by decreasing the coupling constant @xmath13 , by increasing the charge transfer integral @xmath2 , or by decreasing the polaron mass @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of both @xmath13 and @xmath2 suggest that an increase in polaron localization produces a decrease in velocity </S>",
    "<S> . it should be noted , however , that this correlation need not be a general mathematical rule ; for example , by changing @xmath16 it is possible to change the polaron s velocity without affecting its localization at all . </S>",
    "<S> other model parameters , such as the friction constant @xmath17 , also affect the velocity , but do not change the qualitative behavior observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : velocities ] .     and the site energy @xmath38 propagating through poly - dna with a disorder - induced well . here @xmath39=0.1  ev and @xmath14=0 for n@xmath4020 . </S>",
    "<S> at @xmath8=0  ps , @xmath41=0  ev ; at @xmath8=100  ps , @xmath42=0.029  ev.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    structural disorder in the poly - dna can drastically alter the polaron propagation . </S>",
    "<S> an irregularity at a base site @xmath43 can produce a quantum barrier or well , which we represent with a non - zero value of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath45  0 ( a barrier ) , the polaron is usually unable to traverse site @xmath43 for any @xmath46 , instead coming to a stop just before the irregularity . only for very low barriers </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath470.01  ev ) in conjunction with the polaron size and a large electric field ( @xmath480.1  mv /  ) can the large polaron migrate through the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the situation for quantum wells ( @xmath490 ) is very different . </S>",
    "<S> for very shallow wells ( @xmath50 - 0.05  ev ) , the polaron completely enters the well for any @xmath4 , although a large @xmath4 can dislodge the polaron if the well is extremely shallow . for deeper wells , </S>",
    "<S> the polaron sometimes splits into two , with one polaron halting prior to the well and second entering the well ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : blip ] ) . in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the initial polaron stops before the irregularity , but then part of it tunnels from the polaron - induced well ( @xmath29 ) into the disorder - induced well ( @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that the above analysis applies only to poly - dna . in less uniform situations , </S>",
    "<S> the system is generally unstable , and the polaron often tunnels through barriers to reach distant wells @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of polaron propagation and hence the dna conductance is mostly determined by the polaron size in transverse and longitudinal directions . </S>",
    "<S> a decrease of @xmath13 induced by partial delocalization of the charge from the purine base to the whole base pair @xcite provides the extension of polaron size in the longitudinal direction and significantly increases the dna conductance . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a decrease of @xmath13 by 0.2 ev can increase the conductance by @xmath0 6  10 times depending on the electric field value . </S>",
    "<S> the polaron can be destroyed at high electric fields , which then changes the mechanism of charge transfer in the dna molecule and therefore , will cause a discontinuity at the conductance characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> a large polaron has higher velocity but is less tolerant to the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the structural disorders , which form a barrier @xmath51 0.05ev ( well ) on the polaron pathway , depending on energetic conditions and electric field magnitude , can stop ( trap ) the polaron and cause a fast decrease of dna conductance resulting in an insulating behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of disorder on the dna conductance decreases with increasing temperature . </S>"
