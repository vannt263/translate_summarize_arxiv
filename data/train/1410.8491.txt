    "ongoing progress in laser engineering has significantly increased the maximum laser intensity available for ultra - intense laser - plasma experiments .",
    "a number of emerging applications now rely on the ability of high intensity laser beams to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies that considerably exceed the electron rest mass  @xcite .",
    "it has therefore become critical to accurately simulate electron dynamics in an ultra - intense electromagnetic field .",
    "however , it is not always possible to determine whether the simulation has been done with required accuracy and whether the simulation results are physically correct without performing a convergence study .",
    "such a study can be a time - consuming effort without guarantee of a conclusive outcome if the parameter space has not been narrowed down sufficiently using relevant test cases .",
    "convergence studies are best performed based on a fundamental understanding of the numerical and physical constraints on simulation parameters .    a commonly used tool for simulating laser - plasma interactions is a particle - in - cell ( pic ) code that consists of two key blocks : a wave solver on a given spatial grid and a particle pusher that uses the calculated fields to advance particles . two key parameters , besides the number of particles , that determine the accuracy and speed of the simulation are the grid - size and the time - step .",
    "the choice of the two is interrelated through the courant criterion  @xcite , which limits the maximum time step for a given cell size , particularly for explicit codes .",
    "depending on the problem , different criteria are used to determine the cell - size and the time - step .",
    "we are particularly interested in the regime where the plasma density is significantly below the critical density  @xcite or , equivalently , where the laser frequency is significantly above the plasma frequency . in this regime ,",
    "the group and phase velocities of an electromagnetic laser pulse inside the plasma are close to the speed of light , which enables electron acceleration to high energies as the electron moves forward with the pulse via direct laser acceleration . for this type of problem",
    ", one typically determines the spatial resolution first based on the wavelength of the laser pulse and its transverse dimensions .",
    "it is however not necessary to resolve the debye length when simulating electron acceleration by an ultra - intense laser in a significantly under - dense plasma , since the energy that results from numerical heating is inconsequential ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_6 ] for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "the time - step is then determined using the courant criterion , so that the numerical scheme remains stable .",
    "it is usually chosen close to its maximum value allowed by the courant criterion in order to reduce the numerical dispersion of the wave caused by the grid .",
    "however , we find that at sufficiently high intensities in a low density environment , the wavelength does not set the scale for accurate treatment of electron motion .",
    "instead , the electron motion near its stopping points becomes the critical factor resulting in surprisingly stringent requirements for convergence .",
    "given the current widespread use of a large number of differing pic codes , often incorporating multiple algorithms , simple test cases and criteria for evaluating them are highly beneficial .",
    "in particular , since experiments employing intensities of up to @xmath2 w/@xmath3  [ -  @xcite ] are now commonplace and experiments at significantly higher intensities are underway or anticipated  @xcite , evaluation of pic codes in this regime is crucial .",
    "we revisit the dynamics of a single free electron irradiated by a high - intensity plane electromagnetic wave as a test problem for evaluating the performance of a particle - in - cell code .",
    "the electron motion becomes relativistic at large normalized wave amplitudes , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the amplitude of the wave electric field , @xmath6 is the wave frequency , @xmath7 is the speed of light , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electron charge and mass . in this regime ,",
    "most of the electron energy is associated with the longitudinal motion and the maximum relativistic @xmath10-factor increases as @xmath11 . as a result of the longitudinal motion with relativistic velocity ,",
    "the frequency of the transverse electron oscillations decreases by a factor of @xmath10 , which can become substantial for large wave amplitudes .",
    "if , for a given time - step , the simulation reproduces the electron motion with @xmath12 correctly , one might expect that the relativistic motion of an electron with @xmath13 would also be correctly reproduced since the period of the oscillations increases with @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical results presented below show an exactly opposite trend , with the accuracy quickly deteriorating with the increase of @xmath0 for a fixed time - step .    in what follows ,",
    "we outline a criterion that must be considered when simulating electron acceleration by a high amplitude electromagnetic wave in an under - dense plasma .",
    "we show that the electron dynamics can be correctly reproduced only if the time - step is sufficiently small to resolve the electron motion near stopping points along the trajectory .",
    "this condition requires that the time - step in the simulation is less than @xmath14 , where @xmath6 is the wave frequency .",
    "this criterion is independent of constraints on spatial resolution .",
    "it becomes more stringent at higher wave amplitudes due to the fact that the acceleration is more rapid near the stopping points for larger @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the error accumulates primarily along relatively small segments of the electron trajectory in the vicinity of the stopping points .",
    "we therefore propose adaptive electron sub - cycling as an efficient remedy .",
    "the idea is to reduce the time step for a given electron when the acceleration can no longer be correctly reproduced using the original time step .",
    "our results show that sub - cycling permits a dramatic increase in accuracy with only a modest increase in the total number of time steps . given current interest in direct laser acceleration  @xcite , the rapidly increasing focus on using ultra - intense lasers to study radiation reaction  @xcite and the ambition to explore qed effects with lasers in the near future  @xcite , it is important that the new constraint on time - step described here be taken into account .",

    "in this section , we summarize the key features of single electron dynamics in a plane wave in order to establish the context for the subsequent analysis of the numerical results .",
    "we consider a free electron irradiated by a plane wave that propagates along the @xmath15-axis . the wave electric field is directed along the @xmath16-axis and the wave magnetic field",

    "the wave propagation can be described using a normalized vector potential @xmath18 where @xmath19 is only a function of a dimensionless phase variable @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the wave - length , @xmath7 is the speed of light , @xmath22 is the time in the laboratory frame of reference , and @xmath23 is a unit vector .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields of the wave are given by @xmath24 where @xmath9 and @xmath8 are the electron mass and charge .",
    "an initially stationary electron irradiated by this wave moves only in the @xmath25-plane according to the following equations : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are components of the electron momentum and @xmath29 is the relativistic factor .",
    "this system of equations has two integrals of motion : @xmath30 we skip the derivation here , which can , for example , be found in the references  [ -  @xcite ] and [ -  @xcite ] .",
    "the second integral of motion implies that the electron dephases from the wave at a constant rate . in order to show that , we first take the derivative of the phase variable @xmath31 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq_xi ] ) with respect to time @xmath22 , which yields @xmath32 on the other hand , the proper time that we denote as @xmath33 and the time @xmath22 are related by the expression @xmath34 .",

    "( [ deph_1 ] ) , we find that @xmath35 according to the integral of motion ( [ integral_2 ] ) , the expression on the right - hand side is a constant and , therefore , @xmath36 is also a constant .",
    "this means that the phase of the field sampled by the electron increases linearly with proper time .",
    "it is then appropriate to interpret the integral of motion ( [ integral_2 ] ) as the corresponding dephasing rate .",
    "it should be emphasized that the value of the dephasing rate has a direct and significant impact on the maximum energy that the electron gains during acceleration by the wave  @xcite .",
    "this aspect will play a key role in the subsequent analysis in secs .",

    "we initialize a low - density hydrogenic plasma slab ( @xmath49 @xmath50 , where @xmath50 is the critical density ) with cold electrons that are irradiated by a plane electromagnetic wave .",
    "the plasma density is deliberately set very low so that space - charge effects are negligible during our runs and each electron effectively behaves as a free electron in a vacuum .",
    "the plasma is essentially acting as a convenient cold electron source . at this density ,",

    "[ sec_1 ] , the electron should be moving along a parabola @xmath41 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the dephasing rate must remain constant and equal to unity , @xmath59 .",
    "not surprisingly , the convergence to the analytical solution improves as we decrease @xmath54 , which in this case is equivalent to decreasing @xmath53 because their ratio is maintained .",
    "figure   [ fig : phase_space_a0_10 ] shows that there is a correlation between the deviation of the dephasing rate from unity and the deviation of the numerical solution in momentum space from the analytical result .",
    "this trend is also not surprising , because the dephasing rate determines how the field acting on the electron changes in time .",
    "an error in the dephasing causes an error in the electron acceleration and , consequently , leads to an error in the electron momentum .",

    "[ fig : phase_space_a0_10 ] and [ fig : phase_space_a0_15 ] ) , which can result in an unphysical electron drift perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation .",
    "there is a distinct periodic structure of sharp downwards spikes in the dephasing rate . by comparing the time evolution of the dephasing rate and the electron momentum , we find that the downwards spikes correspond to stopping points .",
    "the numerical errors in the dephasing rate change considerably along the electron trajectory and they are the most significant in the vicinities of the stopping points .",

    "we deliberately used the same set of grid sizes and the same ratio @xmath62 as in the case of @xmath51 in order to determine how numerical errors scale with wave amplitude .",
    "let us examine the runs with @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the period of electron oscillations in the laser field increases with @xmath0 due to the increased @xmath10-factor that is primarily associated with the longitudinal motion .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the distance between the downwards spikes in the dephasing rate that is also the distance between stopping points .",
    "since the velocity of the longitudinal motion is close to @xmath7 , longer distance translates directly into a longer interval between stopping points and thus a longer period of oscillations .",
    "the time step for both runs at @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the same , so one might expect that the higher amplitude run would be better resolved and the numerical errors would be reduced .",
    "the comparison of the deviation in the dephasing rate from unity indicates that the trend is exactly the opposite .",
    "greater errors in the dephasing rate then lead to greater errors in the electron momentum at higher wave amplitude .",
    "we therefore conclude that the numerical accuracy deteriorates with increasing wave amplitude for a fixed time step despite the fact that the period of the electron oscillations increases . in the following sections we examine the source of the discovered increasing inaccuracy .",
    "in general , there is a wide range of factors that contribute to numerical errors in a particle - in - cell simulation  ( see reference [ -  @xcite ] , [ -  @xcite ] , [ -  @xcite ] , [ -  @xcite ] and references therein ) .",
    "the results of sec .",
    "[ sec_2 ] indicate that in our test problem the numerical errors in the dephasing rate tend to significantly increase around specific points of the electron trajectory - the stopping points .",

    "we specify the wave field analytically . in the test problem under consideration , this is simply an electromagnetic pulse propagating in a vacuum .",

    "the threshold for the onset of large errors in the electron energy gain appears to scale inversely proportional to the time - step used in the particle pusher .",

    "this can be illustrated using the results presented in fig .",

    "the error in the momentum gain is relatively small at this stage , however , the error in the dephasing rate affects the subsequent electron acceleration by the wave causing considerable error in the maximum electron energy gain .",
    "we have developed an efficient algorithm that allows us to reduce the numerical errors generated by the particle pusher .",
    "the algorithm uses the derived criterion to adaptively decrease the time - step to ensure that the criterion is always satisfied .",
    "we have demonstrated that this adaptive sub - cycling actually becomes more efficient at higher wave amplitudes , so that a significant improvement of the numerical results can be achieved using only a modest increase in the total number of time - steps .    in our analysis , we have used a standard boris pusher to calculate the electron dynamics , since this is the integrator implemented in some of the pic codes frequently used to model laser - plasma interactions .",
    "it has been recently pointed out that the boris pusher might lead to errors when calculating orbits of relativistic electrons  @xcite .",
    "this can be important on those segments of the electron trajectory where the electron is moving forward with a high @xmath10-factor and the electric and magnetic field contributions in the equation of motion almost cancel each other out . the boris pusher does not correctly cancel the electric and magnetic field contributions in the case of a relativistic electron , which can lead to a spurious force  @xcite .",
    "the spurious force and the resulting errors can be eliminated by using the vay particle pusher  @xcite instead of the boris pusher . in the regime considered in this paper ,",
    "the relative role of these errors is however not as significant as the role of the errors from integrating the electron equation of motion near the stopping points .",
    "this is evident from the dramatic improvement that we have achieved by implementing the sub - cycling algorithm while still using the boris pusher .",
    "our discussion has so far been focused on the particle pusher as the main source of numerical errors .",
    "the degradation in numerical accuracy observed in pic simulations under these conditions appears to be primarily from the particle pusher , rather than the field advance .",
    "however , another potential source of errors is the numerical dispersion produced by the field solver .",
    "it is well known that the frequency @xmath6 of a wave with wave - length @xmath21 is less than @xmath115 : @xmath116.\\ ] ] this error can be greatly reduced by keeping the ratio @xmath117 close to unity .",
    "the corresponding discussion can be found in ref . [ -  @xcite ] .",
    "the spatial grid can also lead to numerical electron heating .",
    "the heating is caused by nonphysical instabilities that develop if the grid size exceeds the debye length  @xcite .",
    "the resulting electron energy @xmath118 can be estimated by noting that the heating stops once the debye length @xmath119 becomes comparable to @xmath54 , where @xmath120 is the plasma electron density .",
    "we are interested in a regime where @xmath120 is significantly under - dense for a given frequency @xmath6 of the laser pulse irradiating the plasma .",
    "it is then convenient to introduce a critical density @xmath121 defined by the condition @xmath122 .",
    "the wave propagation in a significantly under - dense plasma is similar to that in a vacuum and thus we effectively have @xmath123 . taking this relation and the definition for @xmath121 into account , we find that the condition @xmath124 yields @xmath125 typically , the grid - size is much less than @xmath126 , so that the electron energy resulting from numerical heating is smaller than @xmath127",
    ". this energy is non - relativistic in a significantly under - dense plasma with @xmath128 . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum energy of an electron accelerated by a wave with amplitude @xmath0 is @xmath129 .",
    "this energy greatly exceeds @xmath118 , provided that @xmath13 and @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , the dephasing rate @xmath130 [ see eq .",
    "( [ deph_est ] ) ] remains close to unity despite the numerical heating since @xmath131 .",
    "this means that the electron acceleration by the wave remains unaffected .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary to resolve the debye length when simulating electron acceleration by an ultra - intense laser ( @xmath13 ) in a significantly under - dense plasma , since the energy that results from numerical heating is inconsequential .    the errors from the particle pusher that we have examined here should be particularly critical when simulating electron acceleration in an underdense plasma .",
    "in a two and three - dimensional set - up , only a small group of electrons are accelerated directly by the laser pulse .",
    "our approach to adaptive sub - cycling would be well suited in this case to improve the accuracy of the numerical results .",
    "our algorithm would automatically single out energetic electrons accelerated by a high - amplitude field , leaving the time - step for the other electrons unchanged . in order to implement the adaptive sub - cycling in a given particle - in - cell code",
    ", one has to orbit - average the current density of the sub - cycled electrons in a way similar to those discussed in refs . [ -  @xcite ] and [ -  @xcite ] .",
    "the orbit - averaged current can then be directly used in the field solver to calculate the fields using the global time - step .",
