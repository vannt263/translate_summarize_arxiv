    "a lot of observational information is now known about the structure of dense cores as progenitors of stars within the molecular clouds ( e.g. , evans  2010 ) . theoretically , we expect that most of these cores will collapse into protostars , but the details of evolutions are less evident .",
    "clearly , the evolution heavily depends upon the effects of local density , pressure , rotation , magnetic fields , the presence or absence of nearby stars and protostars , and upon the other physical phenomena .",
    "the most commonly used picture of low - mass star formation is inside - out collapse ( shu  1977 ) in which it begins at the center of a singular isothermal sphere and an expanding wave of infalling matter propagates outward with the speed of sound . up to now",
    ", different models for core collapse and formation of protostars have been presented , in each the effects of some physical phenomena investigated ( e.g. , mckee and ostriker  2007 ) .",
    "the velocity maps of molecular cloud cores , which are built by using the velocity measurements along the line of sight , show a small velocity gradient across each core . measuring this global velocity gradient , with assumption that core has a uniform rotation and",
    "follow a rigid - body rotation law , can be used to deduce the core angular velocity ( e.g. , goodman et al .",
    "the large size of initial collapsing core implies that even the modest initial rotational velocities will cause the infalling matters to land first on a rotationally supported disk rather than a pressure - supported proto - star ( e.g. , hartmann  2009 , nejad - asghar  2011 ) . in the simplest analysis of rotating collapse , we assume that pressure forces are negligible and so the problem can be analyzed by using ballistic trajectories . the results for collapse of a spherically symmetric cloud in uniform ( solid - body ) rotation",
    "were initially worked out by ulrich  ( 1976 ) , with subsequent extension to disk formation by cassen and moosman  ( 1981 ) , and to collapsing singular isothermal sphere by terebey , shu and cassen  ( 1984 ) .",
    "mendoza , tejeda and nagel  ( 2009 , hereafter mtn ) have recently generalized this idea by construction a steady analytic accretion flow model for a finite rotating gas cloud .",
    "they show that the streamlines and density profiles deviate considerably from ones calculated by ulrich , and for all relevant astrophysical situations , the assumption of a finite cloud radius needs to be used .",
    "the observations indicate that magnetic energy in the molecular clouds is comparable to the gravitational energy ( e.g. , crutcher  1999 ) .",
    "moreover , the magnetic fields are also theoretically believed to play an important role in gravitational collapse of the molecular cloud cores .",
    "they provide pressure support against the gravity and carries away angular momentum prior to and during the collapse of cores to form accretion disks , jets and protostars ( e.g. , machida  2010 ) .",
    "although , in a molecular cloud core , the spatial configuration of magnetic field lines is not simple ( e.g. , whittet  2005 ) , but polarimetry observations of young stellar objects suggest that circumstellar thin disks around the young stars have approximately aligned perpendicular to the magnetic fields ( e.g. , pereyra et al .  2009 ) . here , we consider a simple initial configuration in which the magnetic fields are assumed to be parallel with rotational axis of core .",
    "since the molecular cloud cores are lightly - ionized , the ambipolar diffusion in which the magnetic field is frozen into the charged species and drifts along with them through neutrals , is an important mechanism ( e.g. , adams  2009 ) .",
    "thus , we consider the effect of magnetic fields directly on charged particles , while the neutral species feel them indirectly via the collisions with ions .    in this way , as an extension to the work of mtn , we investigate the effect of axial magnetic field on streamlines of infalling ions and neutral particles .",
    "for this purpose , formulation of problem and equations of motion are given in section  2 .",
    "in section  3 , trajectories of infalling ions and neutral particles are investigated and effect of the magnetic fields on the accretion disk radius is studied .",
    "finally , section  4 is allocated to summary and conclusions .",
    "the molecular cloud cores are lightly - ionized gases with small fraction of ions with density @xmath0 and electrons with density @xmath1 .",
    "if the volumetric rate of electron - ions recombination took place in gas phase , it would be proportional to @xmath2 . in a simple steady state approximation",
    ", the volumetric rate of electron - ions recombination @xmath3 would be equal to the volumetric rate of neutrals ionization via cosmic rays @xmath4 .",
    "although , the actual ionization balance in the molecular clouds is more complicated , elmegreen  ( 1979 ) and umebayashi and nakano  ( 1980 ) showed that the relation @xmath5 is a good approximation . here , we suppose for fiducial purpose that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a dimensionless free parameter which represents the deviations from calculations in the steady state approximation .    in the magnetized cloud cores , the mean velocity @xmath9 of neutrals will not generally equal to the mean velocity @xmath10 of ions and @xmath11 of electrons .",
    "although , the positive ions and electrons feel the magnetic forces in opposite direction , but the induced electric field will generally cause they move in ambipolar motion , so that in the time - scales that are considered here , their mean velocities are approximately the same ( @xmath12 ) . since electrons carry much less momentum than ions , we neglect the dynamic of electrons . in this way , resistance of relative drift between ions and neutrals will be a drag acceleration arises from mutual collisions between them .",
    "the drag acceleration exerted on neutrals by ions is @xmath13 ; the drag acceleration exerted on ions by neutrals is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 ( draine , roberge and dalgarno  1983 ) is the drag coefficient and @xmath16 is a dimensionless free parameter which represents the deviations from calculations in the steady state approximation .",
    "the equations of motion for ions and neutral particles , in gravitational field of a central mass , are respectively as follows @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the proto - stellar mass at the origin , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are ion charge and mass , respectively , as an integer multiple of the electron charge @xmath22 and the proton mass @xmath23 . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath24 .",
    "we measure the length and time in units of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , so that velocity unit is @xmath27 .",
    "mass unit is appointed to @xmath28 , thus the gravitational constant is @xmath29 . in this manner",
    ", we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "finally , the unit of magnetic field is chosen equal to @xmath32 . using these units ,",
    "the equations of motion ( [ equmotioni ] ) and ( [ equmotionn ] ) can be rewritten in a dimensionless form as follows @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a unit vector in the direction of magnetic field , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are two dimensionless free parameters .",
    "choosing the axial magnetic field @xmath38 , the equations of motion in cartesian coordinate are @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the polar and azimuthal angles of ions and neutral particles , respectively , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are their radial distances .",
    "there are four free parameters @xmath37 , @xmath8 , @xmath16 , and @xmath51 which represent the strength of magnetic field , ionization fraction , drag coefficient , and neutral density , respectively .",
    "as mentioned before , there are many observations that show velocity gradients in the maps of molecular cloud cores .",
    "these velocity gradients can be used to deduce the rotation of cores , but evaluation of their angular velocity @xmath52 is considerably complicated because the velocity fields usually exhibit complex supersonic motions . here , we choose the fiducial value of @xmath53 , which in the time unit @xmath26 is @xmath54 .",
    "the effects of initial angular momentum in core collapse and formation of accretion disks are now approximately well known ( e.g. , hartmann  2009 ) . here",
    ", we turn our attention to the effects of magnetic fields and drag force on infalling matters .",
    "if we assume that @xmath55 and @xmath56 , equations ( [ xnddot])-([ziddot ] ) lead to the trajectories which are contained on a plane and given by a _ conic section _",
    "( i.e. , the results obtained by mtn ) .    choosing the initial conditions @xmath57 @xmath58 for position and velocity of infalling particles",
    ", the equations of motion ( [ xiddot])-([znddot ] ) can be solved by numerical methods such as runge - kutta .",
    "approximately , all cores in the maps of molecular clouds seem apparently to be elongated rather than spherical ( e.g. , curtis and richer  2010 ) . since determining the exact three - dimensional shape of a core from apparent observations of the - plane - of - sky is impossible , statistical techniques have to be applied ; as the results , some works indicate a preference for prolate cores ( e.g. , gammie et al .",
    "2003 , li et al .",
    "2004 ) , and some others favour oblate shapes ( e.g. , curry  2002 , jones and basu  2002 ) .",
    "theoretically , the prolate elongation of the cores may be inferred as a remnant of their origin in filaments and turbulent flows ( e.g. , hartmann  2002 ) , while the oblate shape of collapsing cores may be justified from the effects of magnetic fields and rotational motion ( e.g. , nejad - asghar  2010 ) .",
    "the streamlines of infalling particles , in absence of magnetic field ( @xmath56 , @xmath55 ) and initial radial velocity ( @xmath59 ) , for initial spherical core ( @xmath60 ) , oblate core ( @xmath61 ) , and prolate core ( @xmath62 ) are shown in fig.[zrso ] .",
    "the numerical plots of accretion disk radius for neutral particles by substitution @xmath63 , for a wide variety of initial parameters , are shown in fig .",
    "[ rdisk ] .",
    "the numerical results show that the accretion disk radius is approximately proportional to the inverse of initial radial velocity @xmath64 as was given by the analytical ballistic models of mtn .",
    "since we want to investigate the effect of magnetic fields on trajectories of infalling matters , without losing the generality of problem , we consider an initial spherical core with assumption @xmath59 . here",
    "we turn our attention to only one streamline with @xmath60 and @xmath65 .",
    "the effects of axial magnetic field on this streamline are shown in fig.[zrdiffmag ] for three different values of free parameter @xmath37 with a fixed value of three parameters @xmath16 , @xmath8 and @xmath51 equal to @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , respectively . as a result",
    ", we see that the axial magnetic field causes the infalling ions land at a larger equatorial radius , and collisions of ions with neutral particles lead to the same behavior for infalling neutral matters . in fig.[rtogameps ] , the equatorial radii of ion and neutral infalling particles ( from @xmath65 ) are depicted versus @xmath16 and @xmath8 at a fixed value of magnetic field .",
    "we see that increasing of drag coefficient @xmath16 leads to coupling of ions and neutrals so that their equatorial radius reach to each other asymptotically .",
    "the same behavior can be seen for the effect of ionization degree @xmath8 so that increasing of this parameter asymptotically causes to approximately the same equatorial radii of ions and neutral infalling particles .",
    "the third free parameter is neutral density @xmath51 which its effect is the same as @xmath16 but its effect on neutral particles is less .",
    "the density of neutral particles can be evaluated by assuming that the mass infall rate , @xmath69 , is steady .",
    "assuming that the cloud at @xmath70 is nearly spherical , the mass flow in a flow tube spanned by @xmath71 is @xmath72 the density at @xmath73 can be found by following the streamlines corresponding to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 in order to obtain the iso - density contours , we divide @xmath77 to @xmath78 equal segments so that @xmath79 . for two streamlines in the borders of each segment ,",
    "values of @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are evaluated in the mid points . in this way",
    ", the density at different radii and polar angles can be found from ( [ dens2 ] ) , and the iso - density curves can be depicted as typically are shown in fig .",
    "[ isoden ] . in this figure ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is assumed to be @xmath83 .",
    "these iso - density contours show that the axial magnetic fields cause the infalling matters land at a larger equatorial radius .",
    "nowadays , we have accepted that the molecular cloud cores can be gravitationally unstable under certain conditions , and they can collapse . rotational motion of the cores leads to land the infalling matters on an accretion disk around the proto - star .",
    "the streamlines of infalling matters for initial spherical , oblate and prolate cores are depicted in fig.[zrso ] .",
    "obviously , the centrifugal force causes to increase the initial dimension of accretion disk in oblate cores , while it decreases the disk radius in prolate ones .",
    "next , we considered an axil magnetic field in the collapsing core . for investigation the effect of this magnetic field",
    ", we wrote separately the equations of motion of neutral and ion infalling particles .",
    "in general form , these equations are presented with four free parameters @xmath37 , @xmath8 , @xmath16 , and @xmath51 which represent the strength of magnetic field , ionization fraction , drag coefficient , and neutral density , respectively .",

    "our goal is to study the effect of magnetic field and drag coefficient on infalling matters and disk formation , we turned our attention to only one streamline at @xmath65 ; the results are shown in fig.[zrdiffmag ] .    in a steady state of molecular gas , the ions are well - coupled to neutral particles ( i.e. , @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) so that their dynamics are approximately the same . fig.[rtogameps ] shows that increasing of drag coefficient and ionization degree lead to the same behavior for ions and neutral infalling particles . in infalling case",
    ", the frequency of collisions between ions and neutral particles eventually becomes so low that the balance can not be maintained , thus , the values of free parameters @xmath8 and @xmath16 deviate from the steady sate . in this non - equilibrium case",
    ", ions are directly affected by magnetic field so that they land in a larger radii at equatorial plane . in the low - coupling ( @xmath86 ) and high - ionization degree ( @xmath87 )",
