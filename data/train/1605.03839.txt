    "the delightfully unexpected properties of gw150914 have unleashed the creative fury of the theoretical astrophysics community . as a result",
    ", there is an enormous range of proposed channels all aiming to produce bhs in the observed mass range .    in this article , we explore another property of gw150914  its observed ( low ) spin .",
    "the effective inspiral spin parameter , @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the dimensionless bh spins , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the direction of orbital angular momentum ) , is observed to be @xmath10 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , dynamical formation in dense environments ( e.g. in globular clusters , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and merger inside a massive star envelope @xcite .",
    "recently , an isolated stellar field binary scenario that includes chemically homogeneous stars has been discussed by @xcite , and @xcite . for a more complete reference list of proposed channels ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "some of these scenarios predict alignment of the bh spin and the orbital angular momentum . in this case",
    "@xmath11 is just the mass - weighted mean of the dimensionless spins @xmath12 , which can generically be quite large in possible tension with the observed low @xmath11 .",
    "following are the examples .    1 .",
    "formation inside a massive star envelope : the fission of the core to two bhs should generally lead to @xmath13 for each of them . for example , @xcite simulate the fission to two bhs within a common envelope and the subsequent bh  bh merger . in the final orbits before the merger , each simulated bh has @xmath14 , which would lead to @xmath15 compared to the low observed value @xmath16 .",
    "the chemically homogeneous stars scenario : @xcite derived the condition @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the equatorial velocity at the stellar radius , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the angular spin velocity of the star , as the threshold for homogenous evolution ( see their fig .",
    "3 ; larger @xmath21 are required for lower mass stars ) . neglecting the effect of mass - loss during the collapse of a fully mixed star to a bh ( which is justified later on ) ,",
    "the dimensionless spin of the bh satisfies : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ( dimensionless ) radius of gyration of the star related to the moment of inertia by @xmath24 . equation ( [ eq : m case ] ) implies that both bhs should have close - to - maximal spins ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this prediction of @xmath26 is thus in seeming tension with the low observed value @xmath16 . in a more recent study of homogenous evolution , @xcite",
    "provide the threshold @xmath27 values for their models directly .",
    "all systems with @xmath28 that merge within hubble time satisfy @xmath29 for both components , leading to @xmath30 , which also in tension with the low observed value @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite suggested that a disc forms around one of the bhs to later power a short gamma - ray burst . for the specific scenario that they proposed , the spin of this bh is @xmath25 , which is also in tension with the low observed value @xmath16 for gw150914 .",
    "note , however , that by modifying the angular momentum profile of the bh progenitor , this scenario can be tuned to produce a bh with a low spin .",
    "these models , in their raw form , generally predict @xmath11 close to unity .",
    "the observation in gw150914 of @xmath16 thus already provides some constraining power on the details of these models .    in this paper , we will analyse the _ classical scenario _ and show that the spin observation allows us to place a lower limit on the delay time between the formation of the bh+bh binary and the actual merger , @xmath0 .",
    "this arises because a short delay time corresponds to small separation between the primary bh and the star that evolves to become the second bh . for small separations",
    ", the primary bh applies torque to the star , spinning it towards synchronization .",
    "the angular momentum resulting from this process violates the observed upper limit given by the observed @xmath11 .",
    "we derive a simple model to describe this process , and we elucidate the basic considerations here so that future events may be similarly used to constrain models .",
    "we use typical values for these systems to derive for @xmath31 @xmath1 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : a range ] we consider the angular momentum evolution of the secondary star as it collapses to a bh , examining the competing effects of wind - losses and torque - gains . in section  [ sec : implications ] we consider the allowed range of scenarios and demonstrate the application of our limits . in section  [ sec : caveats ] , we consider the caveats and limitations to our main argument .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the _ classical scenario _ for the merger of stellar - mass bhs from an isolated stellar field binary was worked out nearly three decades ago with subsequent modern improvements @xcite . in this picture , prior to the collapse of the second bh , the progenitor system is an isolated stellar field binary that is composed of a wolf  rayet ( wr ) star with a mass @xmath32 and a bh with a mass @xmath33 , @xmath34 being defined as the mass ratio .",
    "we now investigate the angular momentum evolution of the wr star .",
    "the final angular momentum of the wr star is the angular momentum of the second bh under the assumption that there is no mass - loss during the collapse .",
    "mass - loss also increases the initial semi - major axis of the bh+bh orbit compared with the bh+wr orbit .",
    "we will revisit this assumption in section  [ sec : discussion ] and show that mass - loss during the collapse does not change our result significantly .",
    "we further assume that the kick velocity of the second bh at birth is very small compared with the orbital velocity .",
    "any scenario involving a large bh natal kick is ruled out by the existence of the merger .",
    "for an initial orbital semi major axis , @xmath35 , we can normalize the dimensionless spin of the star , @xmath27 , to the orbital angular velocity , @xmath36 : @xmath37 for synchronization between the stellar spin and the orbit ( @xmath38 ) , we define @xmath39 .",
    "because the merger time due to gravitational wave emission , @xmath40 , also depends simply on the initial orbital properties and component masses @xcite : @xmath41 we can write @xmath42 as follows : @xmath43 although not used later on , it may be useful for subsequent studies to derive similar expression for the initial orbital period , equatorial velocity , and the break - up fraction : @xmath44    the angular momentum evolution of the wr star is determined by two competing process .",
    "stellar winds decrease the angular momentum of the star ( section  [ sec : wind ] ) , while torque applied to the star by the bh increases the angular momentum , driving it towards @xmath42 ( section  [ sec : torque ] ) .",
    "we now investigate the impact of each of these processes on the total angular momentum evolution .",
    "mass - loss from wr stars is complicated theoretically and observationally , thus the estimated rates are highly uncertain .",
    "a typical estimate is @xmath45 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , while @xcite estimate @xmath46 independent of mass .",
    "an expected dependence of the mass - loss rate on metallicity further complicates the estimates @xcite . here",
    ", we assume that over the time of the wr phase , @xmath47 , the star does not lose a significant fraction of its mass , i.e. @xmath48 . for massive @xmath49 wr stars , this is a reasonable assumption , as the estimated lifetime is @xmath50 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent study ) , and @xmath51 .",
    "we are interested in @xmath52 , the time - scale for loss of angular momentum resulting from winds .",
    "for @xmath53 the angular momentum is exponentially suppressed due to the wind .",
    "we now estimate this time - scale for the system of interest .    assuming the stellar radius is constant during the mass loss and that the mass is lost from a spherical shell at the stellar surface ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can write the rate of angular momentum loss as follows @xcite : @xmath54 we can estimate @xmath52 by taking the ratio between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 which suggests @xmath58 . in the case that the wind is magnetized , the specific angular momentum of the wind is larger than the previous estimate by a factor @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the alfvn radius , which can significantly decrease the value of @xmath52 .",
    "we can use the observed rotational periods of isolated wr stars to estimate @xmath52 .",
    "there are a few wr stars with a claimed detection of rotation .",
    "two of them show no signs of a companion and quite high angular spin velocities ; wr 134 with @xmath61 @xcite and wr 6 with @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "assume that in the beginning of the wr phase ( @xmath63 ) , the break - up fraction at the surface was @xmath64 , and that the star loses angular momentum only by the wind , then the angular spin velocity is given by @xmath65 the factor in the denominator is 23 for the observed @xmath20 values , typical @xmath19 and @xmath32 values , and @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , in the case that the age of wr 134 and wr 6 is some significant fraction of @xmath47 , we can estimate @xmath67 .",
    "another possibility is that these stars are very young and this is the reason they are observed to be rotating fast . in this case",
    "@xmath52 is smaller by a factor of @xmath68 .",
    "the torque applied to a star in a binary system was first calculated by @xcite .",
    "we use the following expression for the torque applied to the star by the bh , as further described in @xcite , satisfies @xmath69 : @xmath70 in this case , the forced oscillations in the envelope behave like a purely travelling wave . for the case",
    "that @xmath71 is small compared with unity , one must further consider the damping of the waves in the envelope , which is not the relevant regime and thus outside the scope of this paper . ] : @xmath72^{4/3}\\frac{\\rho_c}{\\bar{\\rho}_c}\\left(1-\\frac{\\rho_c}{\\bar{\\rho}_c}\\right)^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the density , @xmath74 is the mean density inside the sphere of radius @xmath75 , and the subscript @xmath76 indicates values at the convective core boundary . given this expression for the torque , the change in @xmath27 can be computed : @xmath77 where the relevant time - scale is @xmath78    in order to estimate this time - scale , we require knowledge of the physical structure ( @xmath19 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) of the wr star .",
    "the time - scale is especially sensitive to @xmath79 as it scales with @xmath82 , and much less sensitive to the other parameters .",
    "note that @xmath83 scales as @xmath84 , and since we are interested in estimating @xmath0 to an order of a magnitude , it is sufficient to estimate @xmath85 ( at some fixed @xmath0 ) to factor of a few , which we presently evaluate .",
    "the values of @xmath19 , @xmath86 , @xmath80 , and @xmath23 are challenging to directly observe , due to optically thick stellar winds that obscure the stellar surface , making the interpretation of measurements challenging .",
    "it is therefore uncertain to use empirical estimates of these quantities , and we are forced to rely on stellar evolution models to obtain estimates of these parameters .",
    "we construct stellar evolution models using the publicly available package mesa version 6596 @xcite .",
    "we aim to cover a wide range of masses during the wr phase ( @xmath87 m_{\\odot}$ ] ) , and for that we select from a set of models having zero - age main sequence masses in the range @xmath88 m_{\\odot}$ ] , metallicities between @xmath89 z_{\\odot}$ ] , and initial rotation between @xmath90 $ ] of breakup .",
    "we use the wr model profiles during the epoch where the time to core - collapse is greater than @xmath91 and the stellar radius is smaller than @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the wr radius according to @xcite .    in all models ,",
    "mass - loss was determined according to the ` dutch ' recipe in mesa , combining the rates from , and @xcite , with a coefficient @xmath94 , convection according to the ledoux criterion , with mixing length parameter @xmath95 , semi - convection efficiency parameter @xmath96 ( * ? ? ?",

    "the profiles are well described by polytropes with @xmath100@xmath101 and @xmath23 is in the range @xmath102@xmath103 , which roughly corresponds to these polytropes .",
    "our calculated stellar radii are compared with the stellar evolution models of @xcite , evaluated in @xcite .",
    "we predict larger radii ( @xmath104 ) at fixed mass in our models relative to the @xcite , possibly because of the simple mesa photosphere boundary condition that we used ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "we note that generally , stellar evolution models predict radii that are significantly smaller than those derived from atmospheric models ( @xmath105 in some cases ; see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and therefore should be considered at the moment as a rough estimate .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainty in the stellar radii is insignificant for our final results , which depend much more strongly on the core radii .    instead of fitting separately for each parameter ,",
