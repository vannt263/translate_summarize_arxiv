    "they found a cyclic structure of the focal set , produced by a semi - periodic re - focussing of light rays .",
    "an often reproduced illustration of a similar light cone drawn by penrose @xcite served as starting point for investigations in global lorentzian geometry @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a very similar focal structure is present on the lightcone of a quite different spacetime , the rotating gdel universe @xcite . in view of the t - duality of higher - dimensional supersymmetric versions of the gdel metric and pp waves @xcite",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that the same type of caustic is present .    for further analytical studies of caustics",
    "it makes sense to discuss spaces of high symmetry first , since here the geodesic equations can be integrated completely .",
    "furthermore , if spacetime homogeneity applies , all lightcones have the same intrinsic geometry , independent of the vertex location",
    ". to this class of spacetimes belong metrics of the   class iii @xcite , which include the gdel metric .",

    "spacetime homogeneity requires at least one further killing field , apart from the three translational killing vectors along the axes , which evidently exist .",

    "a re - examination of the symmetries by teixeira , rebouas and man @xcite , who dropped the more or less implicit assumption of time - independent killing fields made so far , has shown that in the special case @xmath10 the group is @xmath19 , the maximal symmetry group within the gdel - like class of spacetimes .",
