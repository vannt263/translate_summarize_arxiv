    "the fermion mass hierarchy and mixings are some of the least understood aspects of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "many attempts have been made to understand the large disparity among the masses and mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "one approach is the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism @xcite , where an @xmath2 family symmetry is introduced under which the sm fermions are charged .",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation value of a sm - singlet scalar field @xmath4 whose @xmath1 charge , without loss of generality , is normalized to be -1 .",
    "fermion masses are generated by the operators @xmath5 if @xmath6 is a positive integer , and @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath7 if @xmath8 is a negative integer . here",
    "@xmath9 are generation indices , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the @xmath2 charges of the fermions @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the sm higgs doublet @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is the cutoff scale of the @xmath1 symmetry . upon breaking the @xmath1 symmetry ,",
    "the effective yukawa couplings can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 if @xmath18 is a positive integer , and @xmath19 if @xmath20 is a negative integer . by having appropriate @xmath1 charges for various fermions ,",
    "the realistic masses and mixing patterns can be accommodated , with @xmath21 being smaller than unity and @xmath22 . if the model is supersymmetric , which is the case in our model , the couplings to the @xmath7 are not allowed , since the superpotential must be holomorphic . however , in order to ensure d - flatness , a @xmath23 field , which carries charge + 1 , must be introduced , with a vacuum expectation value close to that of @xmath4 . in this case , @xmath24 if @xmath20 is a negative integer . note that as a result the contributions of @xmath25 to gauge anomalies cancel .",
    "models based on a global @xmath1 symmetry have been constructed before ( see references in @xcite ) . however , as any global symmetry is broken by quantum gravity effects , one inevitably has to promote the @xmath1 symmetry to be a gauge symmetry . in this case , the @xmath1 charges of the fields are constrained by the anomaly cancellation conditions .",
    "most attempts",
    "@xcite so far have focussed on an _ anomalous _ @xmath2 symmetry , in which the mixed anomalies are cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism  @xcite , while the @xmath3^{3}$ ] anomaly is not addressed .",
    "the @xmath3^{3}$ ] anomaly can be cancelled by introducing exotic matter fields charged under @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "however , these models often involve a rather large number of exotic particles whose role is merely to cancel the anomalies  @xcite .    here",
    "we pursue an alternative scenario  @xcite where the theory is anomaly - free , without invoking the green - schwarz mechanism or exotic particles other than the right - handed neutrinos , which are required for neutrino masses .",
    "( we do have the fn pair of sm singlets @xmath25 described above , and we will find it necessary to introduce another such oppositely - charged pair , but these do not contribute to gauge anomalies . ) we propose a susy @xmath0 model , combined with a _ non - anomalous _ @xmath1 , in the presence of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we find a set of @xmath1 charges that satisfy _ all _ the anomaly cancellation conditions , including the @xmath3^{3}$ ] anomaly .",
    "note that these charges have to be rational numbers in order for the model to be embedded into a simple group in the uv completed theory ; it is thus highly non - trivial for these solutions to exist .",
    "we show that these @xmath1 charges give rise to realistic quark and charged lepton masses and mixing patterns .",
    "the charges we find also lead to a fn mixing pattern for the dirac neutrino yukawa matrix , @xmath26 ; however to accommodate the right - handed neutrino masses required for the see - saw mechanism we need to introduce a second pair of sm singlet fields @xmath27 with charges @xmath28 .",
    "this leads to a realistic texture for the light neutrino mass matrix , and if we assume that the observed atmospheric neutrino @xmath29 difference sets the scale of the heaviest neutrino mass , it follows that @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore we then find that the dimension 4 r - parity violating operators @xmath31 , are forbidden , and moreover the dimension 5 operators which mediate proton decay are automatically suppressed without additional assumptions or fine - tuning of parameters , because they arise from higher dimensional operators in the effective field theory involving powers of @xmath32 .",
    "this solves a major problem with the usual minimal susy @xmath0 gut theories , and allows our model to be viable .",
    "in @xmath0 , the three generations of matter fields are unified into @xmath33 and @xmath34 representations , where @xmath35 is the generation index . under @xmath2 , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "have charges @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we also introduce right - handed neutrinos , the number of which is a free parameter . if the type - i seesaw  @xcite is the mechanism that gives rise to light neutrino masses , we need at least two right - handed neutrinos to accommodate the current neutrino oscillation data ; we will take three right - handed neutrinos , @xmath38 , which are @xmath0 singlets and carry @xmath2 charges , @xmath39 .    to generate realistic fermion mass hierarchy utilising the fn mechanism and to cancel the gauge anomalies , it turns out that two conjugate pairs of @xmath40 and @xmath41 higgses are required ( this will be clear once the @xmath2 charges are presented ) , which we denote as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath1 charges of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "in addition , we need a @xmath50-dim higgs to break @xmath0 to the sm gauge group .",
    "we take this higgs to be neutral under the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry is broken spontaneously by the vacuum expectation values of the @xmath0 singlets , @xmath4 and @xmath51 , whose @xmath2 charges are normalized to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath54 , as required by d - flatness .",
    "there are three anomaly cancellation conditions that have to be satisfied : the @xmath55^{2 } u(1)_{f}$ ] , gravitation-@xmath1 and @xmath3^{3}$ ] anomalies .",
    "since the @xmath56-dim higgs is neutral under the @xmath1 symmetry , it does not contribute to these anomalies .",
    "as the @xmath40-dim higgses and @xmath4 all appear in conjugate pairs , they do not contribute either .",
    "therefore , only the matter fields , @xmath57 and right - handed neutrinos @xmath38 , contribute to the anomalies . to cancel the anomalies",
    ", their @xmath1 charges must satisfy @xmath58 following @xcite , we parametrize the charges as @xmath59 and @xmath60 with this parametrisation , the conditions ( [ ano1 ] ) and ( [ ano2 ] ) are satisfied automatically .",
    "the values of @xmath36 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constrained by the cubic equation ( [ ano3 ] ) , as well as the observed fermion masses and mixing patterns .",
    "the up - type quark mass matrix is given by the yukawa coupling , @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "we will take the expansion parameter to be the cabibbo angle , @xmath67 . note that if the sum of the charges @xmath68 is non - integer for some @xmath69 and @xmath70 , that particular yukawa coupling is forbidden .    in general",
    ", there are similar operators involving @xmath71 which contribute to the up - type quark masses and thus must be included .",
    "as we will show later , due to the @xmath1 charge of the @xmath72 , these operators are suppressed because the sum of charges @xmath73 is non - integer for all @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is thus sufficient to consider only the operators given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : up ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the case with @xmath74 .",
    "the exponents that determine the quark mass matrix elements @xmath75 are then @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "as the top quark mass is large , it is natural to assume that it is un - suppressed by the expansion parameter .",
    "we therefore demand @xmath78 .",
    "we also assume @xmath79 , which is motivated by the large atmospheric neutrino mixing . with these assumptions , the parameters @xmath80 gives the up - type quark yukawa couplings @xmath81 yielding a realistic up - type quark mass hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "down - type quark masses are generated by the yukawa couplings , @xmath82 all couplings to the @xmath83 are highly suppressed , because the corresponding sums of the @xmath2 charges are non - integer , as we shall see when we present the solutions for the charges .",
    "let us assume that the b - quark mass is generated at the renormalisable level .",
    "( in fact we have also examined the cases when the @xmath63-mass yukawa is suppressed by a factor of @xmath84 with @xmath85 , but without finding a solution more elegant than the one we present here ) .",
    "the exponents of the elements in the down - type quark mass matrix are then @xmath86 and @xmath87 when we take @xmath88 . the yukawa couplings for the down type quarks and the charged leptons are @xmath89 the yukawa matrices @xmath90 and @xmath91 also give rise to realistic ckm matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the georgi - jarlskog relations  @xcite for the first and second generations of down type quarks and charged leptons can be obtained by introducing a @xmath92-dim higgs ( accompanied by a @xmath93 to maintain anomaly cancellation ) .",
    "the following discussion does not depend on this .",
    "let us return to the anomaly cancellation conditions .",
    "the cubic equation in terms of the three free parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath94 reduces to a linear one and it is given by @xmath95 thus for any rational values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , there always exists a solution for @xmath96 .",
    "the simplest set of solutions we found correspond to @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath2 charges for all the fields in the model are shown in table i. it is remarkable that such a simple solution to all the anomaly cancellation constraints exists .",
    "we note that there are degenerate solutions . with @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    ", we again get @xmath101 , but now @xmath102 and @xmath103 . these charges lead to the same effective neutrino mass matrix , @xmath104 , as given in eq .",
    "( [ lightneutrinomass ] ) below .",
    "we now consider the neutrino sector .",
    "the neutrino dirac mass matrix is generated by the yukawa couplings @xmath105 as in the charged fermion sector , we will find that all couplings to the other higgs ( in this case @xmath47 ) are highly suppressed . with the charge assignment given in table i ,",
    "the neutrino dirac yukawa matrix is given by @xmath106    in order to use the type - i seesaw mechanism to generate the effective neutrino masses , we must introduce a second pair of sm - singlets @xmath107 with charges @xmath108 .",
    "then the majorana mass matrix for the right - handed neutrinos is @xmath109 the effective light neutrino mass matrix , after implementing the seesaw mechanism , is @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "if we assume @xmath112 and that the largest neutrino @xmath29 is around @xmath113 , we find @xmath114 gev . the textures given in eqs .  ( [ fu ] ) , ( [ fd ] ) and ( [ lightneutrinomass ] ) have been shown to give successful fermion masses and mixings  @xcite , including those in the neutrino sector  @xcite .",
    ".@xmath2 charges of different fields . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the usual minimal susy @xmath0 gut model suffers from the problem of having rapid proton decay due to the dimension 5 operators mediated by colored triplet higgsinos , if the masses of the susy particles are @xmath115 @xcite .    in our model",
    "the r - parity violating operators @xmath116 are forbidden by our @xmath2 charge assignments , and moreover can not be generated via higher dimensional terms involving powers of @xmath25 and/or @xmath32 .",
    "( in fact with right handed neutrinos we also have the possibility of dimension-4 r - parity violating operators of the form @xmath117 and @xmath118 ; these are similarly forbidden ) .",
    "let us now consider the dimension 5 operators @xmath119 .",
    "in the usual susy gut theory , one needs to tune the parameters @xmath120 to be smaller than @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "these operators are also forbidden here by @xmath2 conservation , but can be generated from higher - dimension operators involving @xmath25 and @xmath32 .",
    "for example the operator @xmath122 has @xmath2 charge @xmath123 , which can be generated from the operator @xmath124 which for @xmath125 is very suppressed .",
    "all the @xmath126 operators are suppressed by @xmath127 .",
    "model  @xcite .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) : in the presence of the @xmath1 , these operators are absent because the yukawa couplings that are circled are highly suppressed . ]    in the standard @xmath0 treatment these operators are generated by color triplet higgs exchange . in our model , however , we have two conjugate pairs of higgses , @xmath128 ) and @xmath129 ) . with the @xmath2 charge assignment given in table i , the couplings @xmath130 and @xmath131 are also suppressed by @xmath127 for any @xmath69 and @xmath70 , because the sums of the @xmath2 charges of the fields involved in each of these operators are fractions of the form @xmath132 etc .",
    "the mass terms that mixes @xmath133 and @xmath134 are similarly suppressed by a factor of @xmath135 . in fig .",
    "( 1 ) we contrast the situations in the standard @xmath0 treatment and in our model .",
    "therefore , all dangerous dimension 5 operators that could lead to fast proton decay are absent in this model  .",
    "we note that a similar mechanism to suppress dimension 5 proton decay operators has been discussed in , for example  @xcite . for more recent work utilising a discrete symmetry , see @xcite . in these models , unlike in our case , the cubic anomaly cancellation condition was not imposed to constrain the charges .",
    "we have constructed a realistic model based on susy @xmath136 , which is free _ all gauge anomalies_. it is quite remarkable that we are able to find such a simple solution for the charges that achieves this .",
    "realistic fermion masses and mixing angles are generated upon breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "we find that three right - handed neutrinos are required in this model in order to cancel the gauge anomalies , in addition to generating neutrino masses .",
    "most interestingly , all dimension 5 operators that could lead to proton decay are automatically suppressed .",
    "the model therefore possesses all the successes of grand unification , while still being consistent with the limits from non - observation of proton decay .",
    "we have not discussed the supersymmetry - breaking sector of the theory , nor the origin of the low energy higgs potential . one",
    "might , for example , consider anomaly mediated supersymmetry - breaking ; particularly since then introduction of an anomaly - free @xmath137 has been advocated as leading to a solution of the tachyonic slepton problem .",
    "however for this to work all the lepton doublets and the charged lepton singlets must have the same sign of the @xmath137 charge , so it is not compatible with the structure of our model . in a non - gut context",
    "a viable marriage of fn textures with anomaly mediation and a @xmath2 was described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( although in that analysis , unlike here , exotic sm singlets are again required to cancel the @xmath2 cubic and gravitational anomalies ) .    since our quark and lepton mass matrices arise from yukawa couplings to @xmath138 and @xmath139 , we need the light higgs doublets @xmath140 and @xmath141 to come primarily from these representations .",
    "note that as indicated above the @xmath133 mass term is suppressed ; however the @xmath142 and @xmath143 mass terms are allowed .",
    "one way to obtain light higgs doublets would be to introduce couplings @xmath144 and @xmath145 tuned as in the original supersymmetric @xmath0 model so as to leave 2 pairs of light higgs doublets and heavy higgs triplets .",
    "having two pairs of higgs doublets would mean that there would have to be quite large threshold corrections in order to maintain gauge unification , unless one arranged to have a one light pair of color triplets .",
    "( this possibility has been considered recently in @xmath146-based models  @xcite . )",
    "we hope to return elsewhere to a full construction of the higgs sector of the theory .    it would be interesting to see if this model can be realized in a more direct way , for example in a string theory model of intersecting branes",
    ". it may be possible to implement the mechanism of @xcite , in which the connection between leptogenesis and low energy leptonic cp violation can be established  @xcite .",
