    "in the beginning of this century the unconventional superconductivity of spin - triplet type had been experimentally discovered in several itinerant ferromagnets . since",
    "then much experimental and theoretical research on the properties of these systems has been accomplished . here",
    "we review the phenomenological theory of ferromagnetic unconventional superconductors with spin - triplet cooper pairing of electrons .",
    "some theoretical aspects of the description of the phases and the phase transitions in these interesting systems , including the remarkable phenomenon of coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism are discussed with an emphasis on the comparison of theoretical results with experimental data .",
    "the spin - triplet or @xmath0-wave pairing allows parallel spin orientation of the fermion cooper pairs in superfluid @xmath1he and unconventional superconductors  @xcite . for this reason the resulting unconventional superconductivity is robust with respect to effects of external magnetic field and spontaneous ferromagnetic ordering ,",
    "so it may coexist with the latter .",
    "this general argument implies that there could be metallic compounds and alloys , for which the coexistence of spin - triplet superconductivity and ferromagnetism may be observed .",
    "particularly , both superconductivity and itinerant ferromagnetic orders can be created by the same band electrons in the metal , which means that spin-1 electron cooper pairs participate in the formation of the itinerant ferromagnetic order . moreover , under certain conditions the superconductivity is enhanced rather than depressed by the uniform ferromagnetic order that can generate it , even in cases when the superconductivity does not appear in a pure form as a net result of indirect electron - electron coupling .    the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism as a result of collective behavior of @xmath2-band electrons has been found experimentally for some uranium - based intermetallic compounds as , uge@xmath3  @xcite , urhge  @xcite , ucoge  @xcite , and uir  @xcite . at low temperature @xmath4",
    "all these compounds exhibit thermodynamically stable phase of coexistence of spin - triplet superconductivity and itinerant ( @xmath2-band ) electron ferromagnetism ( in short , fs phase ) . in uge@xmath3 and uir the fs phase appears at high pressure @xmath5 whereas in urhge and ucoge , the coexistence phase persists up to ambient pressure @xmath6 .",
    "experiments , carried out in zrzn@xmath3  @xcite , also indicated the appearance of fs phase at @xmath7 k in a wide range of pressures ( @xmath8 ) . in zr - based compounds the ferromagnetism and the @xmath0-wave superconductivity occur as a result of the collective behavior of the @xmath9-band electrons . later",
    "experimental results  @xcite had imposed the conclusion that bulk superconductivity is lacking in zrzn@xmath3 , but the occurrence of a surface fs phase at surfaces with higher zr content than that in zrzn@xmath3 has been reliably demonstrated .",
    "thus the problem for the coexistence of bulk superconductivity with ferromagnetism in zrzn@xmath3 is still unresolved .",
    "this raises the question whether the fs phase in zrzn@xmath3 should be studied by surface thermodynamics methods or should it be investigated by considering that bulk and surface thermodynamic phenomena can be treated on the same footing . taking into account the mentioned experimental results for zrzn@xmath3 and their interpretation by the experimentalists",
    "@xcite we assume that the unified thermodynamic approach can be applied . as an argument supporting this point of view",
    "let us mention that the spin - triplet superconductivity occurs not only in bulk materials but also in quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems  thin films and surfaces and quasi-1d wires ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in zrzn@xmath3 and uge@xmath3",
    "both ferromagnetic and superconducting orders vanish at the same critical pressure @xmath10 , a fact implying that the respective order parameter fields strongly depend on each other and should be studied on the same thermodynamic basis  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the shape of the @xmath11 phase diagrams of real intermetallic compounds .",
    "the phase transition from the normal ( n ) to the ferromagnetic phase ( fm ) ( in short , n - fm transition ) is shown by the line @xmath12 .",
    "the line @xmath13 of the phase transition from fm to fs ( fm - fs transition ) may have two or more distinct shapes .",
    "beginning from the maximal ( critical ) pressure @xmath10 , this line may extend , like in zrzn@xmath3 , to all pressures @xmath14 , including the ambient pressure @xmath15 ; see the almost straight line containing the point 3 in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] by the curve which begins at @xmath16 , passes through the point 2 , and terminates at some pressure @xmath17 , where the superconductivity vanishes .",
    "these are two qualitatively different physical pictures : ( a ) when the superconductivity survives up to ambient pressure ( type i ) , and ( b ) when the superconducting states are possible only at relatively high pressure ( for uge@xmath3 , @xmath18 gpa ) ; type ii . at the tricritical points 1 , 2 and 3 the order of the phase transitions changes from second order ( solid lines ) to first order ( dashed lines ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that in all compounds , mentioned above , @xmath13 is much lower than @xmath19 when the pressure @xmath20 is considerably below the critical pressure @xmath10 ( for experimental data , see sec .  8) .",

    "the line of the fm - fs phase transition may extend up to ambient pressure ( type i ferromagnetic superconductors ) , or , may terminate at @xmath24 at some high pressure @xmath25 ( type ii ferromagnetic superconductors , as indicated in the figure ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] , the circle @xmath23 denotes a narrow domain around @xmath10 at relatively low temperatures ( @xmath26 mk ) , where the experimental data are quite few and the predictions about the shape of the phase transition are not reliable .",
    "it could be assumed , as in the most part of the experimental papers , that @xmath27 is the zero temperature point at which both lines @xmath19 and @xmath13 terminate .",
    "a second possibility is that these lines may join in a single ( n - fs ) phase transition line at some point @xmath28 above the absolute zero . in this second variant ,",
    "a direct n - fs phase transition occurs , although this option exists in a very small domain of temperature and pressure variations : from point @xmath29 to point @xmath28 .",
    "a third variant is related with the possible splitting of the point @xmath29 , so that the n - fm line terminates at @xmath29 , whereas the fm - fs line terminates at another zero temperature point @xmath30 ; @xmath31 . in this case",
    ", the @xmath0-wave ferromagnetic superconductor has three points of quantum ( zero temperature ) phase transitions  @xcite .    these and other possible shapes of @xmath11 phase diagrams are described within the framework of the general theory of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) type  @xcite in a conformity with the experimental data ; see also ref .",
    "the same theory has been confirmed by a microscopic derivation based on a microscopic hamiltonian including a spin - generalized bcs term and an additional heisenberg exchange term  @xcite .    for all compounds , cited above",
    ", the fs phase occurs only in the ferromagnetic phase domain of the @xmath11 diagram . particularly at equilibrium , and for given @xmath20 , the temperature @xmath19 of the normal - to - ferromagnetic phase ( or n - fm ) transition is never lower than the temperature @xmath13 of the ferromagnetic - to - fs phase transition ( fm - fs transition ) .",
    "this confirms the point of view that the superconductivity in these compounds is triggered by the spontaneous magnetization @xmath32 , in analogy with the well - known triggering of the superfluid phase a@xmath33 in @xmath1he at mk temperatures by the external magnetic field @xmath34 .",
    "such  helium analogy \" has been used in some theoretical studies ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy terms , describing the fs phase were derived by symmetry group arguments .",
    "the non - unitary state , with a non - zero value of the cooper pair magnetic moment , known from the theory of unconventional superconductors and superfluidity in @xmath1he  @xcite , has been suggested firstly in ref .",
    "@xcite , and later confirmed in other studies  @xcite ; recently , the same topic was comprehensively discussed in ref .",

    "ferromagnetic superconductors the trigger mechanism was recently examined in detail  @xcite .",
    "the system main properties are specified by terms in the gl expansion of form @xmath35 , which represent the interaction of the magnetization @xmath36 with the complex superconducting vector field @xmath37 .",
    "particularly , these terms are responsible for the appearance of superconductivity ( @xmath38 ) for certain @xmath39 and @xmath20 values .",
    "a similar trigger mechanism is familiar in the context of improper ferroelectrics  @xcite .",
    "a crucial feature of these systems is the nonzero magnetic moment of the spin - triplet cooper pairs . as mentioned above",
    ", the microscopic theory of magnetism and superconductivity in non - fermi liquids of strongly interacting heavy electrons ( @xmath2 and @xmath9 band electrons ) is either too complex or insufficiently developed to describe the complicated behavior in itinerant ferromagnetic compounds .",
    "several authors ( see  @xcite ) have explored the phenomenological description by a self - consistent mean field theory , and here we will essentially use the thermodynamic results , in particular , results from the analysis in refs .",
    "mean - field microscopic theory of spin - mediated pairing leading to the mentioned non - unitary superconductivity state has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite that is in conformity with the phenomenological description that we have done .",
    "the coexistence of @xmath40-wave ( conventional ) superconductivity and ferromagnetic order is a long - standing problem in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath40-state cooper pairs contain only opposite electron spins and can easily be destroyed by the spontaneous magnetic moment , the spin - triplet cooper pairs possess quantum states with parallel orientation of the electron spins and therefore can survive in the presence of substantial magnetic moments .",
    "this is the basic difference in the magnetic behavior of conventional ( @xmath40-state ) and spin - triplet superconductivity phases .",
    "in contrast to other superconducting materials , for example , ternaty and chevrel phase compounds , where the effect of magnetic order on @xmath40-wave superconductivity has been intensively studied in the seventies and eighties of last century ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , in these ferromagnetic compounds the phase transition temperature @xmath41 to the ferromagnetic state is much higher than the phase transition temperature @xmath42 from ferromagnetic to a ( mixed ) state of coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "for example , in uge@xmath3 we have @xmath43 k versus maximal @xmath44 k  @xcite .",
    "another important difference between the ternary rare earth compounds and the intermetallic compounds ( uge@xmath3 , ucoge , etc . ) , which are of interest in this paper , is that the experiments with the latter do no give any evidence for the existence of a standard normal - to - superconducting phase transition in zero external magnetic field .",
    "this is an indication that the ( generic ) critical temperature @xmath45 of the pure superconductivity state in these intermetallic compounds is very low ( @xmath46 ) , if not zero or even negative .    in the reminder of this paper , we present general thermodynamic treatment of systems with itinerant ferromagnetic order and superconductivity due to spin - triplet cooper pairing of the same band electrons , which are responsible for the spontaneous magnetic moment .",
    "the usual ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of superconductors has been completed to include the complexity of the vector order parameter @xmath47 , the magnetization @xmath32 and new relevant energy terms  @xcite .",
    "we outline the @xmath11 phase diagrams of ferromagnetic spin - triplet superconductors and demonstrate that in these materials two contrasting types of thermodynamic behavior are possible .",
    "the present phenomenological approach includes both mean - field and spin - fluctuation theory ( sft ) , as the arguments in ref .",
    "we propose a simple , yet comprehensive , modeling of @xmath20 dependence of the free energy parameters , resulting in a very good compliance of our theoretical predictions for the shape the @xmath11 phase diagrams with the experimental data ( for some preliminary results , see ref .",

    "the theoretical analysis is done by the standard methods of phase transition theory  @xcite .",
    "treatment of fluctuation effects and quantum correlations  @xcite is not included in this study .",
    "but the parameters of the generalized gl free energy may be considered either in mean - field approximation as here , or as phenomenologically renormalized parameters which are affected by additional physical phenomena , as for example , spin fluctuations .",
    "we demonstrate with the help of present theory that we can outline different possible topologies for the @xmath11 phase diagram , depending on the values of landau parameters , derived from the existing experimental data .",
    "we show that for spin - triplet ferromagnetic superconductors there exist two distinct types of behavior , which we denote as zr - type ( or , alternatively , type i ) and u - type ( or , type ii ) ; see fig .",
    "this classification of the fs , first mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , is based on the reliable interrelationship between a quantitative criterion derived by us and the thermodynamic properties of the ferromagnetic spin - triplet superconductors .",
    "our approach can be also applied to urhge , ucoge , and uir .",
    "the results shed light on the problems connected with the order of the quantum phase transitions at ultra - low and zero temperatures .",

    "the latter should correspond to the experimental data .",
    "the free energy ( [ eq1 ] ) is quite general .",
    "it has been deduced by several reliable arguments . in order to construct eq .",

    "( [ eq2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "besides , we have used the general case of cubic anisotropy , when all three components @xmath84 of @xmath47 are relevant .",
    "note , that in certain real cases , for example , in uge@xmath3 , the crystal symmetry is tetragonal , @xmath47 effectively behaves as a two - component vector and this leads to a considerable simplification of the theory . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mentioned anisotropy terms are not essential in the description of the main thermodynamic properties , including the shape of the @xmath11 phase diagram . for this reason we shall often ignore the respective terms in eq .  ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath78-term triggers the superconductivity ( @xmath32-triger effect  @xcite ) while the @xmath85term makes the model more realistic for large values of @xmath32 .",
    "this allows for an extension of the domain of the stable ferromagnetic order up to zero temperatures for a wide range of values of the material parameters and the pressure @xmath20 .",
    "such a picture corresponds to the real situation in ferromagnetic compounds  @xcite .",
    "the total free energy ( [ eq1 ] ) is difficult for a theoretical investigation .",
    "the various vortex and uniform phases described by this complex model can not be investigated within a single calculation but rather one should focus on particular problems . in ref .  @xcite the vortex phase was discussed with the help of the criterion  @xcite for a stability of this state near the phase transition line @xmath86 ,",
    "; see also , ref .",
    "the phase transition line @xmath87 of a usual superconductor in external magnetic field @xmath88 is located above the phase transition line @xmath45 of the uniform ( meissner ) phase .",
    "the reason is that @xmath45 is defined by the equation @xmath89 , whereas @xmath87 is a solution of the equation @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the bohr magneton  @xcite . for ferromagnetic superconductors , where @xmath92",

    "one should apply the same criterion with respect to the magnetization @xmath32 for small values of @xmath94 near the phase transition line @xmath95 ; @xmath96 .",

    "the lowest energy term in this diagonal quadratic part contains a coefficient @xmath98 of the form @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "now the equation @xmath100 defines the critical temperature of the meissner phase and the equation @xmath101 stands for @xmath95 .",
    "it is readily seen that these two equations can be written in the same form , provided the parameter @xmath78 in @xmath98 is substituted by @xmath102 ) .",
    "thus the phase transition line corresponding to the vortex phase , described by the model ( [ eq1 ] ) at zero external magnetic field and generated by the magnetization @xmath32 , can be obtained from the phase transition line corresponding to the uniform superconducting phase by an effective change of the value of the parameter @xmath78 .",
    "both lines have the same shape and this is a particular property of the present model .",
    "the variation of the parameter @xmath78 generates a family of lines .",
    "now we propose a possible way of theoretical treatment of the @xmath13 line of the fm - fs phase transition , shown in fig .",

    "the phase transition line of the uniform superconducting phase can be calculated within the thermodynamic analysis of the uniform phases , described by the free energy ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "this analysis is done in a simple variant of the free energy ( [ eq1 ] ) in which the fields @xmath47 and @xmath32 do not depend on the spatial vector @xmath103 .",

    "if the theoretical line @xmath13 is fitted to the experimental data for the fm - fs transition line corresponding to a particular compound , the two curves will coincide for some value of @xmath78 , irrespectively on the structure of the fs phase .",
    "if the fs phase contains a vortex superconductivity the fitting parameter @xmath104 should be interpreted as @xmath105 but if the fs phase contains meissner superconductivity , @xmath104 should be identified as @xmath78 .",
    "these arguments justify our approach to the investigation of the experimental data for the phase diagrams of intermetallic compounds with fm and fs phases . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we shall investigate uniform phases .",

    "the quite interesting topology of the phase diagram of zrzn@xmath3 in the high - pressure domain ( @xmath401 ) is not seen in the experimental phase diagram  @xcite because of the restricted accuracy of the experiment in this range of temperatures and pressures .",
    "these results account well for the main features of the experimental behavior @xcite , including the claimed change in the order of the fm - fs phase transition at relatively high @xmath20 . within the present model",
    "the n - fm transition is of second order up to @xmath402 .",
    "moreover , if the experiments are reliable in their indication of a first order n - fm transition at much lower @xmath20 values , the theory can accommodate this by a change of sign of @xmath77 , leading to a new tricritical point located at a distinct @xmath403 on the n - fm transition line . since @xmath404 a direct n - fs phase transition of first order is predicted in accord with conclusions from de haas",

    "such a transition may not occur in other cases where @xmath283 . in sft ( @xmath112 )",

    "6 and 7 show the low - temperature and the high - pressure parts of this phase diagram , respectively .",
    "there is agreement with the main experimental findings , although @xmath255 corresponding to the maximum ( found at @xmath422 gpa in fig .",
    "5 ) is about 0.3 gpa higher than suggested experimentally  @xcite . if the experimental plots are accurate in this respect , this difference may be attributable to the so - called ( @xmath423 ) meta - magnetic phase transition in uge@xmath3 , which is related to an abrupt change of the magnetization in the vicinity of @xmath255 .",
    "thus , one may suppose that the meta - magnetic effects , which are outside the scope of our current model , significantly affect the shape of the @xmath13 curve by lowering @xmath255 ( along with @xmath237 and @xmath424 ) .",
    "it is possible to achieve a lower @xmath255 value ( while leaving @xmath254 unchanged ) , but this has the undesirable effect of modifying @xmath425 to a value that disagrees with experiment .",
    "in sft @xmath426 the multi - critical points are located at slightly higher @xmath20 ( by about 0.01 gpa ) , as for zrzn@xmath3 . therefore , the results from the sft theory are slightly worse than the results produced by the usual linear approximation ( @xmath111 ) for the parameter @xmath133 .      the estimates for uge@xmath3 imply @xmath427 , so the condition for @xmath13 to have a maximum found from eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "as we discussed for zrzn@xmath3 , the location of this maximum can be hard to fix accurately in experiments .",
    "however , @xmath425 can be more easily distinguished , as in the uge@xmath3 case .",
    "then we have a well - established quantum ( zero - temperature ) phase transition of second order , i.e. , a quantum critical point at some critical pressure @xmath309 . as shown in sec .  6 , under special conditions the quantum critical points could be two : at the lower critical pressure @xmath296 and the upper critical pressure @xmath428 .",
    "this type of behavior in systems with @xmath257 ( as uge@xmath3 ) occurs when the criterion ( [ eq23 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "such systems ( which we label as u - type ) are essentially different from those such as zrzn@xmath3 where @xmath429 and hence @xmath430 . in this latter case ( zr - type compounds )",
    "a maximum @xmath431 may sometimes occur , as discussed earlier .",
    "we note that the ratio @xmath432 reflects a balance effect between the two @xmath47-@xmath32 interactions .",
    "when the trigger interaction ( typified by @xmath135 ) prevails , the zr - type behavior is found where superconductivity exists at @xmath163 .",
    "the same ratio can be expressed as @xmath433 , which emphasizes that the ground state value of the magnetization at @xmath163 is also relevant .",
    "alternatively , one may refer to these two basic types of spin - triplet ferromagnetic superconductors as `` type i ''",
    "( for example , for the `` zr - type compounds ) , and ' ' type ii \"  for the u - type compounds .    as we see from this classification , the two types of spin - triplet ferromagnetic superconductors have quite different phase diagram topologies although some fragments have common features .",
    "the same classification can include systems with @xmath434 but in this case one should use the more general criterion ( [ eq29 ] ) .      in urhge , @xmath435",
    "k and @xmath436 k and , therefore , as in zrzn@xmath3 , here the spin - triplet superconductivity appears at ambient pressure deeply in the ferromagnetic phase domain  @xcite .",
    "although some similar structural and magnetic features are found in uge@xmath3 the results in ref .",
    "@xcite of measurements under high pressure show that , unlike the behavior of zrzn@xmath3 and uge@xmath3 , the ferromagnetic phase transition temperature @xmath437 has a slow linear increase up to @xmath438  kbar without any experimental indications that the n - fm transition line may change its behavior at higher pressures and show a negative slope in direction of low temperature up to a quantum critical point @xmath439 at some critical pressure @xmath10",
    ". such a behavior of the generic ferromagnetic phase transition temperature can not be explained by our initial assumption for the function @xmath147 which was intended to explain phase diagrams where the ferromagnetic order is depressed by the pressure and vanishes at @xmath24 at some critical pressure @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath13 line of urhge shows a clear monotonic negative slope to @xmath24 at pressures above @xmath440 kbar and the extrapolation  @xcite of the experimental curve @xmath13 tends a quantum critical point @xmath441 at @xmath442 kbar . within the framework of the phenomenological theory ( [ eq6 ] ,",
    "this @xmath11 phase diagram can be explained after a modification on the @xmath147-dependence is made , and by introducing a convenient nontrivial pressure dependence of the interaction parameter @xmath135 .",
    "such modifications of the present theory are possible and follow from important physical requirements related with the behavior of the @xmath2-band electrons in urhge .",
    "unlike uge@xmath3 , where the pressure increases the hybridization of the @xmath443 electrons with band states lading to a suppression of the spontaneous magnetic moment @xmath119 , in urhge this effects is followed by a stronger effect of enhancement of the exchange coupling due to the same hybridization , and this effect leads to the slow but stable linear increase in the function @xmath12@xcite .",
    "these effects should be taken into account in the modeling the pressure dependence of the parameters of the theory ( [ eq7 ] ) when applied to urhge .",
    "another ambient pressure fs phase has been observed in experiments with ucoge  @xcite . here",
    "the experimentally derived slopes of the functions @xmath19 and @xmath13 at relatively small pressures are opposite compared to those for urhge and , hence , the @xmath11 phase diagram of this compound can be treated within the present theoretical scheme without substantial modifications .    like in uge@xmath3 , the fs phase in uir  @xcite is embedded in the high - pressure / low - temperature part of the ferromagnetic phase domain near the critical pressure @xmath10 which means that uir is certainly a u - type compound . in uge@xmath3",
    "there is one metamagnetic phase transition between two ferromagnetic phases ( fm1 and fm2 ) , in uir there are three ferromagnetic phases and the fs phase is located in the low-@xmath39/high-@xmath20 domain of the third of them - the phase fm3 .",
    "there are two metamagnetic - like phase transitions : fm1-fm2 transition which is followed by a drastic decrease of the spontaneous magnetization when the the lower - pressure phase fm1 transforms to fm2 , and a peak of the ac susceptibility but lack of observable jump of the magnetization at the second ( higher pressure ) ",
    "metamagnetic \" phase transition from fm2 to fm3 .",
    "unlike the picture for uge@xmath3 , in uir both transitions , fm1-fm2 and fm2-fm3 are far from the maximum @xmath252 so in this case one can hardly speculate that the _ max _ is produced by the nearby jump of magnetization .",
    "uir seems to be a u - type spin - triplet ferromagnetic superconductor .",
    "finally , even in its simplified form , this theory has been shown to be capable of accounting for a wide variety of experimental behavior . a natural extension to the theory",
    "is to add a @xmath444 term which provides a formalism to investigate possible metamagnetic phase transitions @xcite and extend some first order phase transition lines .",
    "another modification of this theory , with regard to applications to other compounds , is to include a @xmath20 dependence for some of the other gl parameters .",
    "the fluctuation and quantum correlation effects can be considered by the respective field - theoretical action of the system , where the order parameters  @xmath47 and @xmath32 are not uniform but rather space and time dependent . the vortex ( spatially non - uniform )",
