    "this virtual flexibility has resulted in numerous proposals about how to design atom - optical elements such as traps , guides and also interferometers @xcite .",

    "these restrictions can be circumvented by superimposing time - dependent magnetic field components on the static fields .",
    "this give rise to adiabatic potentials which show an enormous flexibility and versatility @xcite . with the support of such time - dependent fields one can create even complicated geometries such as rings and interferometers with comparatively little effort .",
    "such atom optical elements are ideal tools to study interference @xcite and tunneling @xcite of bose - einstein condensates .    in this paper",
    "we discuss in detail the theoretical foundations of the adiabatic potentials that emerge if the magnetic hyperfine states of an alkali atom are being coupled by an external radio frequency ( rf ) field . in sec .",

    "we assume the magnetic field to decompose according to @xmath8 the static field @xmath9 serves for the purpose of trapping , i.e. there are trapped states even in the absence of the field @xmath10 being a monochromatic radio frequency ( rf ) field which is used to couple the different magnetic hyperfine sub - states .",
    "the static magnetic field vector @xmath9 defines a natural quantization axis which we refer to as the @xmath11-axis . to manifest this in the following we construct a unitary transformation that rotates the angular momentum vector @xmath5 such that it is aligned with the local magnetic field vector",

    "none of the orbitals shows a spatially symmetric occupation like the squared modulus of the wave function which has interesting consequences for the interference contrast . from the squared modulus of the final state s wave function ( see figure [ fig : double_well ] ) one would expect to achieve @xmath136 of contrast in the interference pattern , i.e. @xmath137 . the actual calculation of the interference pattern ( [ fig : dw_interference])b , however , yields a contrast of about @xmath138 .",
    "this modification of the interference pattern by the spatially asymmetric occupation of the spinor orbitals will be subject of the following discussion .",
    "we focus on the rf double - well which is described by equation ( [ eq : general_ioffe_plus_rf ] ) if @xmath139 or @xmath115 .",
    "we consider the interference pattern that emerges if two completely separated clouds which are located in the two wells interfere .",
    "for the purpose of illustration we consider the one - dimensional dynamics along the axis which is defined through the position of the double - well minima @xmath140 ( see figure [ fig:1d_approximation]a ) .",

    "this means that the spin states of the two initial , now interfering , fragments were not identical .",
    "it is easily seen this effect to lead to a reduction of the interference contrast and to a variation of the global phase of the interference pattern .",
    "to calculate the quantity @xmath151 we use the unitary transformations which we have employed to achieve the adiabatic rf potentials . in the dressed frame",
    "the spinor wave function is independent of the spatial coordinate and will be characterized by @xmath152 . to obtain the spin wave function in the lab frame",
    "@xmath143 we have to apply the unitary transformations ( [ eq : unitary_trafo_1 ] ) , ( [ eq : rotating_frame ] ) , ( [ eq : trafo_removes_omega_term ] ) and ( [ eq : unitary_trafo_2 ] ) .",
    "after that we receive @xmath153 hence we find @xmath154 this expression simplifies considerably if we employ cylindrical coordinates . with @xmath155 and @xmath156",

    "the general structure of the interference term is similar for all cases .",
    "one encounters a time - independent term which accounts for the static components of the magnetic field and an oscillating one which gives rise to a temporal modulation of the interference pattern .",
    "this can be interpreted as the effect of the micro - motion of the atoms within the adiabatic potentials similar to trapped ions in a paul - trap . using equation ( [ eq : spin12_contrast ] )",
    "one finds a phase variation of @xmath172    \\approx 2\\left[\\frac{g\\rho_0}{b_i}\\right]\\left[1+\\left[\\frac{2\\hbar\\triangle}{g_f\\mu_b    b_{rf}}\\right]^2\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\label{eq : phase_wobbeling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] over one rf oscillation period . for a spin @xmath173",
    "particle this rf phase dependence of the interference pattern is shown in figure [ fig : contrast]b .",
    "the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : phase_wobbeling ] ) is the leading order term in @xmath174 .",
    "hence the phase oscillations can be suppressed by keeping the ratio @xmath174 small which is in agreement with the previous assumption @xmath102 .",
    "the above consideration assumes an immediate switch - off of all external magnetic fields before the expansion of the matter wave .",
    "however , for all practical purposes there is always a finite switch off time .",
    "one might think of switching off the fields such that finally all atoms are rotated into the same spin state but the spatial shape of the matter wave remains unchanged . to succeed in establishing such a sophisticated switching - off procedure",
    "seems to be unlikely since at each spatial and temporal position the atomic spin state had to be rotated differently .",
    "we have presented the theoretical foundations for the description of rf induced adiabatic potentials . starting from a hamiltonian that takes into account the coupling of a single hyperfine manifold to an external field we have carried out a number of unitary transformations . after performing the rotating wave approximation and neglecting the non - adiabatic couplings which emerge from the transformed kinetic energy we have received the corresponding adiabatic potential surfaces .    to demonstrate the power of this rf induced dressed adiabatic potentials",
    "we have discussed a simple field configuration consisting of a static ioffe - pritchard trap and two orthogonal homogeneous rf fields .",
    "our analytical calculations have shown that by tuning the strength of the rf fields a smooth transition from a single well into a double well is achievable .",
    "this transition can be easily exploited to split a cloud of ultracold atoms . by introducing a relative phase shift between the two rf fields furthermore a transition from a double well to a ring potential can be performed . for our considerations",
    "we have mainly focussed on @xmath175 in the @xmath116 hyperfine ground state . for this",
    "species the analytical results have been verified by a numerical wave packet propagation which was conducted using a linear single particle schrdinger equation and the original hamiltonian . for typical experimental parameters these numerical results",
    "have been shown to be in very good agreement with the ones obtained from the analytic adiabatic approach .",
    "finally we have discussed interference experiments carried out in a rf double - well potential . since the trapping potential is a consequence of a spin - field coupling the spin state of a trapped atom cloud",
    "depend on its actual spatial position .",
    "this essentially leads to a spatially asymmetric distribution of the atomic wave function within the individual spinor orbitals and an inevitable reduction of the interference contrast .",
    "moreover , the rf field imposes a high - frequency oscillation on the interference fringes which is reminiscent of a micromotion .",
    "the magnitude of these effects can be well controlled by appropriately tuning the experimental parameters such as the ioffe field strength and the detuning .",
    "overlap of the spin wave functions for atoms in the @xmath177-state calculated according to equation ( [ eq : interference_contrast ] ) : @xmath178^{2f}.\\label{eq : spin1_contrast}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the atom is assumed to occupy the maximal stretched stated , i.e. @xmath179 . like in the @xmath180-case ( equation ( [ eq : interference_contrast_spin12 ] ) )",
