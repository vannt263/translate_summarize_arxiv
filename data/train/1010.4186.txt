    "_ * _ _ *    here we have used the numbers in the digital forms .",
    "this allows us to make rotation of @xmath5 and interestingly the equation remains the same .",
    "the digits appearing on the right side of above equation 0 , 1 and 2 are the same on day 20.10.2010 , i.e. , the day of submission of this work .",

    "* bimagic square * is a magic square where the sum of square of each element of rows , columns and two principal diagonals are the same . for simplicity ,",
    "let us write it as @xmath7 .",
    "* *    universal magic squares are the magic squares having following properties :    1 .",
    "* upside down * , i.e. if we rotate it @xmath5 ( degrees ) it remains again the magic square ; 2 .",
    "* mirror looking * , i.e. , if we put it in front of mirror or see from the other side of the glass , or see on the other side of the paper , it always remains the magic square .",
    "in the above equation we have the digits * 1 - 6 - 9 * on the left side and the digits * 0 - 1 - 2 * on the right side . in both cases we have below _ upside down magic squares _ formed by two algorism combinations made from three digits in each case .",

    "i.e. , they remains the same when we give a rotation of @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the second magic square can be considered as universal , i.e. , when we look it from the mirror it is again a magic square , obviously , in this case the sum is not the same .",
    "more studied on _ universal magic squares _ can be seen in taneja @xcite .",
