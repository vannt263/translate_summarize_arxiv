    ", we may mention that 100 @xmath32c water in a 15 cm - high cylinder with an imposed temperature difference @xmath52 @xmath32c would correspond to @xmath55 .",

    "however , varying independently @xmath62 and @xmath4 permits us to investigate separately the effect of these quantities .    the effect of changing the bubble number from 50000 to 150000 at the same @xmath4 is shown in figures  [ fig : nuvsxi_varynb]a and  [ fig : nuvsxi_varynb]b for @xmath63 and @xmath9 , respectively . in the latter case",

    "the heat transfer enhancements achieved are much smaller than ours , most likely due to the significantly smaller number of bubbles ( only a few hundreds ) , as well as other differences ( the values of @xmath51 , @xmath25 etc . ) of lesser importance .",

    "as well known the boundary layers formed on the bottom ( and top ) plate are marginally stable and occasional intermittent eruptions of hot ( or cold ) liquid occur at their edges .",

    "the immediate observation is that the small - scale fluctuations are much stronger in the two - phase case .",
    "as expected , the positive and negative velocity fluctuations are correlated with warm and cold temperature fluctuations , respectively .",
    "to give an impression of the difference brought about by the presence of bubbles on the convective motions in the cell , we show in figure  [ fig : tsnapshots ] snapshots of the dimensionless temperature in a vertical plane through the axis of the cell for @xmath8 in the single - phase ( a ) and two - phase ( b ) cases , the latter for @xmath78 and @xmath114 .",
    "we notice that bubbles considerably thicken the layer of hot fluid near the base and make it more energetic compared to the single - phase situation .",
    "chunks of hot liquid can be seen all the way up near the cold plate , presumably caused by the latent heat deposited by condensing bubbles in the bulk liquid .",
    "the up - down symmetry of the single - phase case that can be seen in the left panel is markedly absent in the two - phase case because of the tendentially upward motion of the bubbles which condense on encountering liquid colder than @xmath28 .",

    "the red line is the single - phase case , while the dashed line is for the two - phase cases with @xmath54 ; the results for the different bubble numbers superpose within the resolution of this figure . for both cases",
    "the dimensionless bulk mean temperature is close to 0.5 , i.e. , @xmath115 .",
    "a close inspection of the figure shows that this tendency is enhanced in the two - phase case because the bubble surface temperature is fixed at the same value @xmath28 .",
    "it may be expected that , in this situation , not many bubbles will grow or condense in the bulk and only condense once they reach the neighborhood of the top plate .",
    "the figure also shows that , in the two - phase case , the boundary layers near the top and bottom plates are not symmetric .",
    "this feature can be seen more clearly in figure  [ fig : boundary_coldhot ] where details of the mean temperature near the upper and lower plates are shown .",
    "the lack of symmetry between the two is more evident here together with the thinning of the boundary layers with increasing numbers of bubbles .",
    "this latter result is a clear manifestation of the enhanced convective circulation inside the cell promoted by increasing the number of bubbles .",
    "[ fig : boundarylayer2 ]    for the hot plate , one can define the thermal boundary layer thickness as @xmath116_{z=0}$ ] where @xmath117_{z=0}$ ] is the mean temperature gradient at the hot plate .",

    "the three sets of data now collapse on a single line in the range @xmath119 .",
    "the small differences farther away from the wall reflect differences in the shape factor of the boundary layers .",
    "in summary , our investigation of a simple model of rayleigh - bnard convection with boiling has demonstrated the effect of the degree of superheat and of the bubble number on heat transport .",
    "comparison with existing data suggests a basic conformity of our results with some physical features of a real systems .",
    "vapor bubbles significantly enhance the heat transport primarily by increasing the strength of the circulatory motion in the cell .",
    "the velocity and thermal fluctuations of the boundary layers are increased and , by releasing their latent heat upon condensation in the bulk fluid , the bubbles also act as direct carriers of energy . we have shown that the heat transfer enhancement can be interpreted in terms of an enhanced buoyancy which is shown in eq .",
