    "orbital electron capture by the atomic nucleus ( ec ) is one of nuclear decay modes governed by weak interactions , a common and well known type of radioactivity @xcite . in this process the released energy @xmath3 ( equal to the transition energy @xmath4 minus the binding energy of the captured electron in the daughter atom )",
    "is shared between an emitted electron neutrino and the final atom . with a small probability , of the order of @xmath5 with respect to the normal ec decay",
    ", a photon can be emitted together with the neutrino . in such radiative electron capture decay ( rec )",
    "the energy is shared statistically between three bodies , thus the energy spectrum of these photons is continuous .",
    "the theoretical description of rec was initiated by morrison and schiff @xcite who neglected the coulomb field of the nucleus and took into account just 1s electrons and only in non - relativistic approximation .",
    "an advanced and more accurate theory of radiative electron capture was developed by glauber and martin in refs .",
    "they included exactly the coulomb field in the propagation of the electron , took into account relativistic effects as well as screening and considered captures from higher shells .",
    "however , they limited themselves to the allowed decays where the nuclear spin changes by @xmath6 with no parity change .",
    "predictions of this model were tested in a large number of experiments , and satisfactory agreement was found @xcite .",
    "a more general theory of rec , extended to any order of forbiddenness ( i.e. for arbitrary change of nuclear angular momentum and parity ) , was developed by zon and rapoport in ref .",
    "@xcite and zon in ref .",
    "for verification of their results , first forbidden unique transitions ( @xmath0 , @xmath7 ) are of special importance because of a cancellation of the nuclear matrix elements in the ratio of radiative to the nonradiative capture rate .",
    "measurements of radiation accompanying the 1s ec decay in the case of @xmath1ca @xcite , which belongs to this category , revealed a serious disagreement with results of refs .",
    "the shape of the photon spectrum differed from the prediction , and the total probability of the rec process per ordinary nonradiative decay was found to be _ larger _ by a factor of 6 than the predicted one . to resolve this discrepancy a possibility of photon emission by the nucleus , in so called detour transitions , was examined by kalinowski et al .",
    "@xcite following ideas developed by ford and martin @xcite .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the nuclear contribution to the rec process accompanying forbidden transitions can be substantial . in particular , for the case of @xmath1ca it was claimed @xcite that the detour transitions fully account for the missing intensity established by the experiment . however , for another first forbidden unique transition  the 1s ec decay of @xmath2tl  a different situation was encountered .",
    "the measured intensity of the rec spectrum @xcite was found to be _ smaller _ by a factor of 4 than the value predicted by the model of zon leaving no room for the nuclear contribution , in contradiction with results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although we agree in general with refs .",
    "@xcite that nuclear radiation takes place , we point out that the separation of radiation emitted by the electron and the nucleus , respectively , is not physical because it depends on the particular gauge used in the description of the electromagnetic field .",
    "we argue , that although physical results do not depend on the selected gauge , the so called _ length _ gauge is preferred for the actual calculations .",
    "first , it suppresses the nuclear contribution , and second , it makes possible important simplifications in the calculations .",
    "we note that some formulae of zon in @xcite for @xmath0 transition are divergent for the point nucleus .",
    "it means that approximations which lead to these formulae may not be correct .",
    "for example , an assumption that the radius of the region where the photon emission occurs is much larger than the dimension of the nucleus where the capture takes place , is not valid in the coulomb ( velocity ) gauge used by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the failure of the theory of zon and rapoport to describe the experimental data for forbidden ec transitions , and the controversy concerning the nuclear contribution to the rec process , motivated us to address these questions theoretically in an independent and different way . in this work",
    "we recalculate the radiative electron capture process in the length gauge . we restrict ourselves to the 1s electron ( k - capture ) only , but the extension to other states is straightforward . in the following section we describe our calculations in detail .",
    "the results , in terms of a dimensionless shape factor , for the case of the first forbidden unique transitions are presented in section iii and are compared to the experimental data for @xmath1ca and @xmath2tl .",
