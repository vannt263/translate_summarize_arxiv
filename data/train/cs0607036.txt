    "@xcite , density matrices of graphs are simply combinatorial laplacians normalized to have unit trace ( the normalization consists of dividing the nonzero entries by twice the cardinality of the edge set ) . in this way , to any graph @xmath0 ( with labeled vertices ) can be associated a specific mixed quantum state ( identified with its matrix representation ) , which is then called the _ density matrix of _ @xmath0 .",
    "if the vertices of a graph are arranged in a multi - dimensional array , then the density matrix of the graph carries a block structure , which can be associated with a split of the quantum system into subsystems .",
    "each array dimension will then correspond to one subsystem , and the length of the array dimension will equal the number of pure states the subsystem can assume .",
    "it is useful to remark that the combinatorial properties of the graph @xmath0 up to isomorphism do not always characterize its density matrix and therefore do not specify the physical properties of the state .",
    "this explains why we need to consider labeled graphs .",
    "in other words , we assume that graphs with different adjacency matrices ( even if belonging to the same isomorphism class ) have different density matrices and then correspond to different quantum states , whose properties can be radically different .    studying density matrices of graphs with the tool - box provided by quantum mechanics has a twofold role : from the perspective of combinatorics , this interface can be fruitful in uncovering and re - defining graph theoretic properties ; from the perspective of quantum mechanics , density matrices of graphs can be seen as simple  and highly symmetric  states .",
    "observed under this light , density matrices of graphs provide a restricted testing ground for better understanding techniques and concepts employed in more general settings .",
    "such an approach has particular value , when considering the particular kind of developments in quantum physics and its applications that we are experiencing today .",
    "indeed , the study of finite - dimensional states is important in quantum information processing .",
    "this is the multidisciplinary area whose goal is to understand and exploit the information encoded in quantum states ( see nielsen and chuang @xcite for a monograph on the subject ; see alber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a collection of overviews ) .",
    "the basis of this field consists of interpreting certain quantum physical entities as information carriers and their evolution in time as information processing dynamics .",
    "such a view is giving rise to a number of discoveries and successful real world applications , the most popularized examples being quantum communication and quantum computing .",
    "the main ingredient which most likely is responsible for the quantumness  is the concept of _ entanglement _ , a property associated to certain quantum states .",
    "while at the early stages of quantum physics entanglement was considered a mystery , nowadays it is recognized as a precious resource , difficult to create and to preserve .",
    "defining entanglement is not an easy task ( bru  @xcite compiles an eloquent list of definitions ) .",
    "speaking about entanglement makes sense only if one considers a system composed of at least two subsystems .",
    "the rough idea is that if the two parties ( or , equivalently , subsystems ) are _ entangled _ then a complete description of the whole system does not imply a complete description of the parts and _ vice versa_. so , two entangled systems present some kind of _ correlation _ that does not appear to occur in the realm of classical mechanics , where complete information on the system implies a complete description of its individual parts .",
    "> from the mathematical point of view , the theory of entanglement is rich and diversified .",
    "it has branches in geometry , knots , lie groups , positive maps , combinatorics , convex optimization , _ etc_. the main problems are : _",
    "( i ) _ determine whether a given quantum state is entangled ; _ ( ii ) _ determine how much entanglement is in a given quantum state ; _ ( iii ) _ determine the quality  of entanglement ( _ e.g. _ , the problem of distillability ) .",
    "as we mentioned above , density matrices of graphs are a restricted set in which these tasks can have a special treatment . specifically , braunstein _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and wu @xcite considered the _ quantum separability problem ( qsp ) _ for these matrices . the qsp is the computational problem of deciding whether a given quantum state is entangled or not , that is _ separable _ ( ioannu 2006 @xcite is a recent review ) .",
    "the qsp is equivalent to an instance of a combinatorial optimization problem called the weak membership problem and defined in grtschel _",
    "_ @xcite . in its complete generality",
    "the qsp is np - hard ( gurvits @xcite ) .",
    "there is some evidence that the qsp for density matrices of graphs might be easier than for general density matrices .",
    "a simple necessary condition for separability is that the degrees of the vertices of @xmath0 are the same as the degrees of the vertices of another graph , @xmath1 , obtained from @xmath0 by mean of a simple operation acting on the edges .",
    "the operation is a combinatorial analogue of the linear algebraic partial transposition .",
    "in fact , the graph @xmath1 will be called here _ partially transposed graph_. the condition for separability will be called here _ degree - criterion_. since the partial transposition is centrally involved in the famous _ peres - horodeckis criterion _ for separability of general states @xcite ( also called _",
    "positivity under partial transpose criterion _ , or , for short , _ ppt - criterion ) _ , it is natural to investigate the relation between the degree - criterion and the ppt - criterion when applied to density matrices of graphs .    in this paper",
    ", we give an elementary proof that the two criteria are equivalent for density matrices of graphs .",
    "we also exhibit a simple example showing that the degree - criterion is not sufficient for testing separability of density matrices of disconnected graphs ( that is , graphs with more than one connected component ) .",
    "additionally , we verify the sufficiency of the degree - criterion when the dimension of one of the parties is two , therefore giving an alternative proof of a result of wu @xcite .",
    "there are four sections in the paper .",
    "the above observations are exposed in section 2 , after providing the necessary notions and terminology .",
    "section 3 is devoted to point _",
    "( ii ) _ above . in particular",
    ", we focus on the concurrence .",
    "this is a quantity associated to every density matrix and it is strictly larger than zero for entangled states ( hill and wootters @xcite ) .",
    "we derive a simple upper bound on the concurrence of density matrices of graphs and show the exactness of this bound for graphs with four vertices . in section 4",
    "we draw some conclusions .",
    "the purpose of this section is to shed further light onto the qsp of density matrices of graphs .",
    "first , we state formally the qsp and define the ppt - criterion .",
    "we then recall the notion of combinatorial laplacian .",
    "we define the degree - criterion and we prove its equivalence with the ppt - criterion .",
    "we conclude the section by showing that the degree - criterion is necessary and sufficient for testing separability of density matrices of graphs in @xmath2 ( see also wu @xcite ) .",

    "a matrix of the form @xmath14 \\otimes p\\left [ \\left\\vert \\varphi\\right\\rangle \\right ] $ ] is called a _ product state _ ,",
    "where the symbol @xmath15  denotes the kronecker or tensor product .",

    "a density matrix @xmath24 is said to be _ entangled _ if it is not separable .",
    "entangled states can not be prepared from separable states by mean of operations acting locally on the subsystems .",
    "although the definition given here refers to exactly two parties , entanglement can be defined as well for systems composed of many subsystems .",

    "the failure of the ppt - criterion is then the failure of an operational characterization of entangled states , which is computationally simple verify .",
    "the ppt - criterion is necessary and sufficient for separability of density matrices acting on @xmath51 or @xmath52 ( horodecki _ et al . _",

    "moreover , one easily sees that the optimal decomposition of the density matrices of these graphs just corresponds to the decomposition of the combinatorial laplacians as sums of laplacians of 1-edge graphs .",

    ".    recall that @xmath183 is the set of edges of the partially transposed graph @xmath1 .",
    "thus an edge is matched if and only if it is part of a criss - cross of two edges belonging to a set of ( vertex - disjoint ) entangled edges on @xmath73 vertices ( see also @xcite ) . ] or it is separable . since graphs consisting of a criss - cross give rise to separable density matrices , we have the following results .",
    "* observation 3 .",
    "* let @xmath178 be as above .",
    "let further @xmath184 be the subset of all matched edges .",
    "then the graph @xmath185 has a separable density matrix .",
    "* observation 4 .",
    "* let @xmath186 be a 1-edge graph , with its @xmath37 vertices arranged in a @xmath179 array , and let @xmath187 be its density matrix .",
    "then the concurrence of @xmath187 is given by 0 if @xmath138 is a separable egde and by 1 if @xmath138 is not separable , and hence unmatched .",
    "let @xmath178 be as above .",
    "let @xmath188 be the number of matched egdes of @xmath0 and @xmath189 be the number of unmatched edges .",
    "then the concurrence of the density matrix @xmath24 of @xmath0 is bounded from above by @xmath190 in particular , for any graph @xmath0 with density matrix @xmath24 we have @xmath191 .    assume the above notations .",
    "let @xmath192 be the density matrices of the graphs @xmath193 and @xmath194 , respectively , where @xmath195 is the set of matched edges and @xmath196 the set of unmatched edges .",
    "then the density matrix @xmath24 of @xmath0 is given by the convex combination @xmath197 and the density matrix @xmath198 is given by @xmath199 , where @xmath187 is the density matrix of the 1-edge graph @xmath200 .",
    "by convexity of the concurrence and by observations 3 and 4 we obtain @xmath201    for all of the above graphs on four vertices either the density matrix is separable or we have @xmath202 , in which case 1 over the number of edges is an upper bound for the concurrence .",
    "as can be seen from the table , the bound is actually achieved .",
    "the concurrences of graph density matrices which have rank 2 are listed in @xcite .",
    "examples ivb , ivc and ix in @xcite or the tally - mark[multiblock footnote omitted ] show that in general the upper bound is not exact , even for graphs on @xmath203 arrays .",
    "we call a graph @xmath178 _ maximally entangled _ if the concurrence of its density matrix @xmath24 is given by @xmath204 .    all edges of a maximally entangled graph",
    "must hence be unmatched .",
    "some natural questions arise :    * are there nonisomorphic graphs with the same concurrence ? * how can graphs with rational concurrence be characterized ? * is the concurrence of @xmath89 related to specific combinatorial properties of @xmath0 ? * can the set of edges of a graph @xmath205 with density matrix @xmath24 always be partitioned in two subsets @xmath206 such that the density matrix of @xmath193 is separable , @xmath194 is maximally entangled and @xmath207 ? * how can maximally entangled graphs be characterized ?",
    "* does there exist a class of density matrices of graphs for which testing separability is a difficult problem ?",
    "maybe , the existence of such a class would provide a transparent proof that detecting entanglement is hard .",
    "unfortunately , explicit formulae for computing the concurrence of density matrices are known so far only for dimensions @xmath208 ( see , rungta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , li and zhu @xcite , and mintert _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and for density matrices of rank 2 @xcite .",
    "this is an obstacle when thinking about the questions above .",
    "nevertheless , one can still hope to find an _ ad - hoc _",
    "formula for @xmath177 , when @xmath24 is the density matrix of a graph .",
    "in fact , it may well be that the optimal decompositions of @xmath89 in pure states are very special .",
    "finding such a formula would be interesting in view of potential generalizations .    putting the concurrence on a side ,",
    "one may ask if there is some entanglement measure specifically tailored for @xmath89 . considering the apparent success of the degree - criterion",
    ", a naive _ _ measure would be the normalized euclidean norm @xmath209 .",
    "the _ logarithmic negativity _ is a well - known entanglement measure and it is defined by @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the sum of the magnitudes of all negative eigenvalues of @xmath140 ( see vidal and werner @xcite ) .",
    "there are examples of graphs @xmath0 and @xmath103 for which @xmath212 but @xmath213 ( ghosh @xcite ) .",
    "we have proven that the degree - criterion is equivalent to the ppt - criterion .",
    "it is thus in general not sufficient for separability of density matrices of graphs . as a matter of fact",
    ", we have provided a counterexample within graphs having isolated vertices .",
    "nevertheless , we have been able to prove the sufficiency of the degree - criterion when one of the subsystems has dimension two . in particular , as a corollary of theorem 2 , one can easily obtain the separability of criss - crosses and tally - marks .",
    "we have also considered the concurrence as a possible entanglement measure of density matrices of graphs . there could be more suitable entanglement measures for such kind of states , especially because no explicit formula for concurrence is known when @xmath214 and the rank of the density matrix is exceeding 2 .",
