    "the local low - mass ( below @xmath0 @xmath1 ) supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass function is not well known .",
    "current estimates of the smbh mass function are based on host galaxy properties ( luminosity of the bulge or bulge stellar velocity dispersion @xmath2 ) and known scaling relationships between the mass @xmath3 of the smbh and these properties ( most prominently @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "these estimates can be widely discrepant with each other at the low - mass end ( see , for example , fig .  8 in @xcite ) .",
    "much of the uncertainty arises because it is unknown how the scaling relationships extrapolate to very late - type and very low mass galaxies . yet",
    "smbhs _ do _ exist in very late - type spirals , e.g.ngc 4395 , a spiral galaxy of type sdm , with @xmath6 @xmath1@xcite , and in very low mass galaxies , e.g.  pox 52 , a dwarf galaxy , with @xmath6 @xmath1@xcite .",
    "most of the measured smbh masses are @xmath7 @xmath1  or greater , however , as the sphere of influence of a less massive smbh is extremely hard to resolve even at moderate distances , even with the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "for example , the sphere of influence of a @xmath8 @xmath1  smbh at 15 mpc is @xmath9 milliarcseconds .",
    "since we can not detect low - mass smbhs by their dynamical signature , looking for them by signs of their accretion activity may be the only viable way of detecting them .",
    "an accreting low - mass smbh should be a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) .",
    "how can an llagn be identified ?",
    "broad emission lines in the optical spectrum allow an unambiguous confirmation of the presence of an agn .",
    "the sample of low - mass smbhs in @xcite was identified this way . however , as the luminosity of an agn decreases , the optical spectrum of the galaxy nucleus becomes more and more dominated by host galaxy light , and the signature of the agn becomes difficult to detect .",
    "for the lowest - luminosity agns , therefore , it is possible that a system based on optical spectra would not classify the nuclei as agns at all .",
    "even when the optical spectrum shows no clear evidence of an agn , however , such evidence may still be present in other wavelengths , such as x - ray and radio @xcite , and infrared @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission is an ubiquitous property of agns . if late type galaxies indeed host supermassive black holes in their nuclei , and yet they have not been discovered until now , they are most likely highly obscured",
    "this is less of a problem in x - rays than in optical bands .",
    "x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ have uncovered agns in what were thought to be normal galaxies in clusters @xcite and in fields @xcite .",
    "x - ray surveys have also found new classes of agns , e.g. `` x - ray bright optically normal galaxies '' ( xbongs ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is highly likely that a strategy of uncovering hidden agns in optically normal galaxies using x - ray detections might work .",
    "the sub - arcsecond angular resolution of _ chandra _ is advantageous for this program for identifying the true nucleus from surrounding galactic sources . with these considerations we initiated a _",
    "program to search for active nuclei in centers of nearby late type galaxies identified as x - ray sources .",
    "as we discuss below , this was relatively easy ; we detected nuclear x - ray sources in a large number of galaxies .",
    "the second part , identifying the x - ray sources as accreting smbhs was far more difficult .",
    "we used a variety of techniques and multiwavelength data for this purpose .",
    "our goal is to search for low - level nuclear activity in a representative sample of low - mass galaxies within 20 mpc .",
    "we selected 38 galaxies from the nbg catalog @xcite with following criteria : face - on spirals ( s0sdm ) or de and _ not _ known to host agns .",
    "we excluded starburst galaxies from the sample to ease the identification of nuclear x - ray sources .",
    "liner galaxies were included because the nature of their energy source is still a matter of debate . based on their optical luminosities ( @xmath10 ) and morphology ,",
    "most of these galaxies are expected to host smbhs with @xmath11 @xmath1 , with a few objects hosting smbhs as small as @xmath12@xmath1 .    with this study",
    "we hope to set firm lower limits to the number of galaxies which host low mass bh , and to address the following questions : +  what fraction of galaxies host active smbhs and what governs the activity of these smbhs ? +  how does the fraction of active galaxies depend on the galaxy morphology & environment ? +  what is the primary component of a galaxy that relates to its bh mass : the bulge or the dark matter halo ? finding active nuclei in bulge - less spirals would imply the latter .",
    "+  what is the relation between nuclear star formation activity and accretion onto a bh ?",
    "+  is there a lower bound to the local bh mass function ?",
    "+  how do we understand bh growth and its relation to hierarchical galaxy formation ?",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    of the 38 _ chandra _ targets , 28 have been observed to date .",
    "we also found 16 galaxies in the _ chandra _ archive meeting our selection criteria . additionally , there were 6 galaxies in the archive which met similar criteria applied to the rc3 catalog .",
    "we discuss the latter sample first .",
    "the six galaxies in this sample have morphological types sa , sb , sc , scd ( 2 ) and sd .",
    "all six have nuclear x - ray sources . for two galaxies , ngc 4713 ( sd ) and ngc 4647 ( sc ) ,",
    "the data are inconclusive , but we can not rule out that they are agns .",
    "interestingly , for two weak - bulge galaxies ngc 5457 ( scd ) and ngc 3184 ( scd ) we can make a strong case that they host agns ; these galaxies are discussed in detail in ghosh et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) .",
    "the remaining two galaxies , ngc 3169 ( sa ) and ngc 4102 ( sb ) are almost certainly agns ; we discuss these here .    *",
    "ngc 3169 : * this is an sa galaxy at 20 mpc , classified optically as a low ionization nuclear emission line region ( liner ) .",
    "_ chandra _ detected a nuclear hard x - ray source ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n31n41 ] ) , indicative of an agn .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is an absorbed power - law with slope @xmath13 and column density @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "the agn identification is clinched by the fact that the x - ray source coincides with a 7mjy mas - scale vla radio source @xcite .",
    "thus the source is almost certainly an agn .     where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the counts in the 2.58 kev and 0.32.5 kev bands , respectively .",
    "the lightest pixels show the softest emission ( @xmath18 ) and the darkest pixels the hardest emission ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the bars in the lower left of each panel represent a projected distance of @xmath20 pc .",
    "north is up and east to the left in both panels . ]    * ngc 4102 : * this is a sb galaxy at 17 mpc , classified optically as a hii nucleus .",
    "_ chandra _ detected a hard point source in its nucleus with extended soft emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n31n41 ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of the nuclear point source is a power - law with @xmath13 and no intrinsic absorption .",
    "however , a strong fe k-@xmath21 line is detected with ew=2.5 kev . even though the error on the ew is large , owing to the low s / n of the spectrum , the ew is inconsistent with the ( @xmath22 ev ) value observed in unabsorbed agns .",
    "thus the spectrum is that of a reflection - dominated source .",
    "image and the spectrum are similar to those of seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the nucleus is also a first radio source .",
    "moreover , it is also an ir point source ( 2mass ) with luminosity @xmath23 erg / s .",
    "this puts the source squarely in the agn regime .",
    "these observations show the power of x - ray detection and multiwavelength identification of agns in what were thought to be `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "( see @xcite for complete analysis of the sample . )",
    "the six galaxies in the archival sample discussed above were scrutinized one by for the possible signature of an agn .",
    "this has been a hard job owing to the low luminosity of the sources ( except for the two best cases discussed above ) .",
    "dilution of the agn signature due to contamination from the host galaxy light then becomes a major problem .",
    "obscuration also affects the observed properties . as a result , traditional diagnostics of finding agns , such as uv excess , x - ray to optical flux ratio , x - ray to ir flux ratio , existence of broad emission lines , line rations of narrow emission lines , all break down . indeed ,",
    "if it were not a difficult task , we would have already known that these galaxies host agns !",
    "the identification problem becomes somewhat easier with a larger sample .",
    "in addition to the six galaxies discussed above , we found 16 more from @xcite in the chandra archive following our selection criteria .",
    "nuclear x - ray sources were detected in 12 .",
    "thus , 18 of the 22 archival galaxies host a nuclear x - ray source .",
    "moreover , in most cases , the nucleus was the brightest x - ray source , in one the second brightest x - ray source and in one the only x - ray source .",
    "it is highly unlikely that the brightest x - ray binary , a star , or any other normal galactic x - ray source resides in the nucleus most of the time .",
    "thus we conclude that most of the _ chandra _ detected nuclear x - ray sources are agns .    our new _",
    "survey was much shallower than the archival observations .",
    "preliminary analysis indicates that 6 out of 28 galaxies host a nuclear x - ray source .",
    "reverberation mapping of broad emission lines provides a standard method for measuring bh masses in agns . alternatively ,",
    "scaling relations using the width of broad emission lines and agn luminosity are used .",
    "how should we measure bh masses in our newly discovered agns which do not show broad emission lines ?",
    "this can be done in a variety of ways :    \\1 .",
    "as noted above , host galaxy contamination is a major contributor toward hiding the agn signature of our low - luminosity sources .",
    "broad emission lines of these agns might have been swamped by the host galaxy light in ground - based spectra .",
    "therefore it is imperative to obtain spectra of these sources with the highest possible spatial resolution from space , e.g. with stis on hst .",
    "this might uncover broad emission lines .",
    "construction of power - density spectra ( pds ) using x - ray variability analysis provides a powerful tool for bh mass determination @xcite . the break frequency in pds",
    "is found to correlate strongly with the bh mass ; since our sources are x - ray detected , this is potentially a highly feasible method .",
    "smbh mass is known to correlate with the bulge velocity dispersion @xcite and the bulge luminosity @xcite .",
    "these relations can be used for bh mass determination , once we ascertain the existence of a smbh .",
    "this method , however , will not work for bulge - less galaxies .",
    "moreover , if we do not have independent measurements of bh masses , we can not extend these known correlations to low bh masses .",
    "thus there are several ways to estimate masses of smbhs which we uncover using x - ray detections .",
    "this is obviously a hard job ; at this point , however , we are at the step of finding these low - mass smbhs in the first place .",
    "\\1 . through our _ chandra _ survey and the accompanying archival programs",
    "we have realized that traditional diagnostics for identifying agns fail for low - luminosity agns embedded in luminous galaxies . we need to develop new diagnostic tools using multi - wavelength data for this purpose .",
    "hst acs imaging .",
    "this will help obtain true colors of the agn , after removing a substantial contribution of the host galaxy .",
    "we can them identify an agn with traditional `` uv excess '' and/or with broad - band spectral energy distribution .",
    "ir diagnostics : _ spitzer _ irac colors . while agns are blue in the optical , they are red in mid - ir .",
    "agns occupy a distinct location in the irac color - color plot , allowing identification of x - ray sources @xcite .    \\6 .",
    "ir diagnostics : near ir spectra .",
    "high ionization ir emission lines with irs on _ spitzer _ have been used to uncover agns by @xcite . with the end of _ spitzer _ cryogenic mission ,",
    "irs is no longer available .",
    "finding near - ir `` coronal '' lines might prove useful for the same purpose .",
    "hard x - ray observations .",
    "a survey of nearby galaxies in hard x - rays will detect and identify nuclear smbhs ( as well as off - nuclear accreting bhs ) .",
    "the indian x - ray mission astrosat , which has hard x - ray capabilities is due to launch in 2009 .",
    "astrosat observations will be invaluable in our bh quest .",
