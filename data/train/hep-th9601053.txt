    "0.5truecm    the problem of gauging a sigma model has been considered in the past , first by faddeev@xcite and also in the works of witten@xcite and rubakov@xcite for the skyrme@xcite model on @xmath2 , which is esentially the @xmath1 sigma model .",
    "rubakov@xcite in particular considers the properties of the soliton in the @xmath3 gauged skyrme model .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to construct a topologically stable soliton in a particular @xmath0 gauged skyrme model .    the problem of gauging a sigma model such that the resulting system supports topologically stable finite action or energy solutions was recently considered in @xcite and @xcite , the first for the @xmath4 gauged @xmath5 grassmanian model on @xmath6 and the second for @xmath7 gauged grassmanian models on @xmath8 .",
    "the only limitation of these models is that their definitions are restricted to _ even _ dimensions and the physically important problem of the soliton of the skyrme model@xcite , which is the @xmath1 sigma model defined on @xmath2 .",
    "indeed with this problem in mind , a peculiar gauging of the @xmath9 model on @xmath6 was proposed in @xcite . denoting the sigma model fields @xmath10 with @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , the gauging prescription proposed",
    "was stated via the minimal coupling in terms of the covariant derivative @xmath13 as :    @xmath14    the topological invariants we sought to employ in @xcite were the integrals of densities which were total divergences .",
    "since the topological charge density of the @xmath9 sigma model is not a total divergence but is only _ locally _ a total divergence@xcite , we ignored the @xmath9 model gauged with the @xmath4 field according to ( [ 1.1 ] ) and proceded@xcite instead to gauge the @xmath5 model .",
    "subsequently however the @xmath9 model on @xmath6 , gauged according to ( [ 1.1 ] ) was shown by schroers@xcite to support topologically stable and even self - dual solutions .",
    "it is our aim here to gauge the @xmath1 gauge model@xcite on @xmath2 employing an extended version of the minimal coupling prescription given by ( [ 1.1 ] ) , where the @xmath4 is replaced by the @xmath0 gauge group , and to show that the corresponding gauged system supports stable solitons . while we shall restrict our considerations here to this @xmath15 dimensional case , it should be noted that all our considerations in the present work can be extended to the @xmath16 dimensional case systematically , with the @xmath17 gauging of the @xmath18 skyrme - sigma model@xcite . the starting point in that case would be the generalisation of the minimal coupling prescription ( [ 1.1 ] ) to    @xmath19    where @xmath20 are the generators of @xmath17 in the _ vector _ representation , with @xmath21 , and @xmath12 . in what follows",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath22 . in that case , the minimal coupling given by ( [ 1.2 ] ) corresponds to gauging the vector @xmath3 subgroup of the chiral @xmath23 .",
    "note that the above gauging ( [ 1.2 ] ) for @xmath22 differs from that employed in @xcite .",
    "this is easily seen by identifying the @xmath3 group valued field @xmath24 as @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . in components",
    "then , it turns out that @xmath29 and @xmath30 , in the notation of ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "the cornerstone in our construction of the gauged skyrme model on @xmath2 is the selection of a suitable topological charge density which could be exploited to give a lower bound on the energy density of a suitably modified version of the @xmath15 dimensional skyrme model .",
    "since we are dealing with a skyrme - sigma model featuring a constrained field and a global @xmath1 invariance , we expect that the relevant topological charge density will be only a _ locally _ total derivative quantity as was realised in @xcite .",
    "the topological charge density of the @xmath1 skyrme@xcite model is given by    @xmath31    where the index @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , etc .",
    ", and the volume integral of ( [ 2.1 ] ) yields the winding number provided that the fields exhibit the appropriate asymptotic behaviour .    the gauged version of the density ( [ 2.1 ] ) , namely @xmath34 is given in terms of the @xmath22 version of the covariant derivative ( [ 1.2 ] ) @xmath35 the two densities ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.2 ] )",
    "are related as follows @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath0 curvature of the connection defined by the first member of ( [ 2.3 ] ) , and the density @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 the latter is a _ gauge variant _ quantity , like the density @xmath40 , ( [ 2.1 ] ) . as we shall see below",
    ", the topological charge density will turn out to be @xmath41 which is manifestly _ gauge invariant _ as it should be .",
    "the volume integral of the topological charge density @xmath40 of ( [ 2.9 ] ) in fact reduces to the volume integral of the winding number density @xmath42 of ( [ 2.1 ] ) , provided that the surface integral of @xmath38 vanishes .",
    "this will be verified below for the spherically symmetric field configurations . here",
    "we procede to explain our criteria by means of stating the following belavin inequality :    @xmath43}\\phi^c \\phi^d)^2 \\ge 0\\ ] ]    where the square brackets@xmath44 $ ] on the indices imply antisymmetrisation , the constant @xmath45 has the dimension of length and the constant @xmath46 is dimensionless .",
    "the inequality ( [ 2.6 ] ) is the first member of the two pairs , for the second member of which there are two options .",
    "these are , respectively ,    @xmath47    @xmath48    in both of which the constant @xmath49 has the dimension of length and the yet undetermined functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 depend only on @xmath52 , which according to the second member of ( [ 2.2 ] ) is the gauge invariant component of @xmath53 .    as usual",
    ", the energy density will be the sum of the square terms of ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7a ] ) , and respectively ( [ 2.7b ] ) , when these are expanded .",
    "choosing the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 appropriately in each case , results in the cross term coinciding with the topological charge density @xmath40 defined by ( [ 2.9 ] ) .",
    "the topological charge , which is the volume integral of the latter , will be equal to the volume integral of @xmath42 since the surface integral of @xmath38 vanishes as will be verified explicitly in the case of the spherically symmetric field configuration below .",
    "it then follows that the lower bound on the energy is the degree of the map , namely the winding number of the hedgehog given by the volume integral of @xmath42 , _ provided _ that suitable asymptotic conditions are satisfied .",
    "these are stated as usual to be    @xmath56    the appropriate choices for the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 turn out to be the same , and namely , @xmath57 respectively , leading to the two alternative hamiltonian densities given by    @xmath58}\\phi^b ) ^2\\ ] ]    and @xmath59}\\phi^b ) ^2.\\ ] ]    we notice that both hamiltonian densities break the global @xmath1 symmetry of the corresponding ungauged sigma model , namely the skyrme model .",
    "this is manifested through the appearance of @xmath60 and @xmath61 instead of @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "this situation can easily be altered by adding suitable positive definite terms to each of ( [ 2.10a ] ) and ( [ 2.10b ] ) without invalidating the respective topological inequalities . in the case of ( [ 2.10a ] ) for example",
    ", the quantity to be added is @xmath64 times @xmath65 .",
    "both ( [ 2.10a ] ) and ( [ 2.10b ] ) then take the form    @xmath66}\\phi^b ) ^2,\\ ] ]    in which the constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 have the dimensions of length , and the constant @xmath69 is dimensionless .",
    "the hamiltonian density ( [ 2.10c ] ) coincides with the system proposed by faddeev in ref.@xcite .",
    "the volume integrals of ( [ 2.10a ] ) , ( [ 2.10b ] ) and ( [ 2.10c ] ) are bounded from below by the winding number according to    @xmath70    provided that the field configurations satisfy at least the asymptotic conditions ( [ 2.8 ] ) .",
    "it is not possible to saturate the inequalites ( [ 2.11 ] ) by saturating the inequalities ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7a ] ) separately to minimise _ absolutely _ the energy corresponding to ( [ 2.10a ] ) , and , ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7b ] ) separately to minimise the energy of ( [ 2.10b ] ) _",
    "absolutely_. by minimising absolutely we mean solving the system by some first order bogomolnyi equations , and in the case of ( [ 2.10c ] ) this is not possible even in principle . for the models given by ( [ 2.10a ] ) and ( [ 2.10b ] ) , while in principle possible , the saturated versions of ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7a ] ) , ( [ 2.7b ] ) respectively , are overdetermined as is the case also for the ( ungauged ) skyrme model@xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the corresponding situation for the @xmath71 dimensional @xmath9 model where both the ungauged@xcite and the gauged@xcite models support self - dual solutions . in the following therefore",
    ", we are concerned only with solutions of the second order euler- lagrange equations of the models ( [ 2.10a ] ) , ( [ 2.10b ] ) and ( [ 2.10c ] ) , and not with the solutions of some first order bogomolnyi equations .",
    "the spherically symmetric fields are given by the ansatz @xmath72 @xmath73 yielding the following field strengths @xmath74 @xmath75 in ( [ 3.1 ] ) -([3.4 ] ) @xmath76 is the unit position vector and @xmath77 etc .",
    "as stated in the previous section , we are concerned exclusively with the second order euler - lagrange equations here , and not in first order bogomolnyi equations obtained by saturating ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7a ] ) , and respectively ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7b ] ) .",
    "these are easily verified in this spherically symmetric configuration ( [ 3.1 ] ) and ( [ 3.2 ] ) to be overdetermined .",
    "we define the static hamiltonian density of the one dimensional subsystem obtained by substituting ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) into ( [ 2.10a ] ) , ( [ 2.10b ] ) and ( [ 2.10c ] ) respectively , by @xmath78 = \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\int d^3 x { \\cal h}\\ ] ] where the dimensionless radial variable @xmath79 is defined in the two cases as @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively , and @xmath82 . the definition ( [ 3.5 ] )",
    "is made , up to an unimportant constant multiple in each case .    since the alternative models ( [ 2.10a ] ) ,",
    "( [ 2.10b ] ) and ( [ 2.10c ] ) are qualitatively similar , we shall restrict ourselves in the following to the detailed asymptotic and numerical study of one of these models only .",
    "we find it more natural to prefer models ( [ 2.10a ] ) and ( [ 2.10b ] ) to ( [ 2.10c ] ) because the former satisfy the minimal topological inequality ( [ 2.11 ] ) , albeit without saturating it , while model ( [ 2.10c ] ) satisfies an inequality derived from ( [ 2.11 ] ) itself .",
    "next , we eschew model ( [ 2.10b ] ) because of its unconventional yang - mills term .",
    "thus we restrict our considerations below to the model given by ( [ 2.10a ] ) .    in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath83 ,",
    "the resulting one dimensional hamiltonian density for the models given by ( [ 2.10a ] ) is    @xmath84+\\frac{9\\lambda_1 ^ 2   \\lambda_2 ^ 2}{2 }   \\cos^2 f [ \\rho^2 f_{\\rho}^2 \\cos^2 f + 2a^2 \\sin^2 f]\\ ] ] @xmath85 + 2\\lambda_2 ^ 2   a^2 \\sin^2",
    "f [ 2f_{\\rho}^2 + \\frac{a^2\\sin^2 f}{\\rho^2}]\\ ] ]    we first check that the topological charge , namely the volume integral of @xmath40 given by ( [ 2.9 ] ) reduces to the usual winding number , namely the volume integral of @xmath42 for the spherically symmetric field configuration ( [ 3.1 ] ) and ( [ 3.2 ] ) when the appropriate asymptotic conditions for the function @xmath86 @xmath87 are satisfied . in that case the volume integral of @xmath42 is guaranteed to be the _ unit _ topological charge of the hedgehog .    concerning the asymptotic behaviour required of the fuction @xmath88 in the region @xmath89",
    ", this is determined by regularity at the origin , while in the region @xmath90 there are several possibilities consistent with a power decay of the function @xmath88 at infinity , which is a necessary condition for _ finite energy _ solutions .",
    "these asymptotic values are @xmath91 and @xmath92 . unlike in @xmath3 higgs theory@xcite ,",
    "the behaviour of the gauge field and hence of the function @xmath88 at infinity is not directly relevant to the topological stability of the soliton . in the latter case@xcite",
    "the topological charge coincides with the magnetic flux of the monoplole field , while here the topological charge is the degree of the map , which is the unit winding number for the spherically symmetric fields under consideration . using the magnetic flux density @xmath93 , for the spherically symmetric field configuration",
    ", we calculate the surface integral for the magnetic flux @xmath94|_{r=\\infty}.\\ ] ] irrespective of the value of @xmath95 , the flux @xmath96 vanishes by virtue of the second member of ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "the models at hand therefore _ do not _ describe magnetic monopoles .    before stating our asymptotic conditions for the function @xmath88 , we note that for the topological charge density @xmath40 given by ( [ 2.9 ] ) to reduce to the usual winding number density @xmath42",
    ", the surface integral of @xmath38 must vanish .",
    "this is seen by calculating the relevant one dimensional integrand , namely the quantity @xmath97 , from its definition ( [ 2.5 ] ) , @xmath98 which on the infinite 2-sphere clearly vanishes irrespective of which of the asymptotic values @xmath91 or @xmath99 holds , provided that the corresponding condition stated by the second member of ( [ 3.7 ] ) does hold .",
    "anticipating the results of our numerical integration to be carried out below , we state the asymptotic values of @xmath88 as @xmath100    the euler - lagrange equations for the model given by ( [ 3.6 ] ) , with respect to the arbitrary variations of the functions @xmath86 and @xmath88 are respectively ,    @xmath101 @xmath102\\ ] ] @xmath103   -2\\lambda_1 ^ 2 a^2",

    "the asymptotic behaviours of the solution in the @xmath90 region are also power decays like for the usual ( ungauged ) skyrmion@xcite .",
    "( exponential decay can be obtained by incorporating a suitable gauge invariant @xmath1 breaking potential@xcite . )",

    "the constants @xmath113 and @xmath114 in ( [ 3.15 ] ) and ( [ 3.16 ] ) are fixed by the numerical integration .",
    "the numerical integrations have been performed for the values of the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",

    "the profiles of the energy densities pertaining to each of these solutions are plotted in figure 3 , and they correspond to the total energies @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "before proceding to summarise our results and making some qualitative comments , we give a breif quantitative description of the baryonic current that the topological charge employed above pertains to .",
    "the latter is the volume integral of the density @xmath40 given by ( [ 2.9 ] ) , which we identify with the fourth , time - like , component of this current @xmath124 .",
    "accordingly , the full minkowskian vector current is          the second term on the right hand side of ( [ 4.2 ] ) being a total divergence , its volume integral vanishes and hence can be neglected .",
    "it follows from ( [ 4.2 ] ) that the divergence of the current @xmath124 given by ( [ 4.1 ] ) is      the right hand side of ( [ 4.3 ] ) can be shown to be _ locally total divergence _ which means that its volume integral vanishes and hence can be ignored , leading to a conserved baryonic current , @xmath130 .",
    "this is exactly what we expect , since the _ vector _ gauging ( [ 2.3 ] ) does not lead to the divergence of the current being equal to an anomaly .",
    "our current ( [ 4.1 ] ) can be compared to that of goldstone and wilczek@xcite , where the @xmath1 sigma model has been gauged in the usual way according to @xmath131 } \\phi^b$ ] , and contrasted with the corresponding current of dhoker and farhi@xcite where the skyrme model featuring the @xmath3 valied field @xmath24 has been gauged with the @xmath132 @xmath3 field according to @xmath133 . in the latter case@xcite ,",
    "the divergence of the baryonic current equals the anomaly .",
    "we have unfortunately _ not _ succeeded to adapt the constructions employed in the @xmath1 sigma model with field @xmath53 , to the analogous case where the @xmath3 valued skyrme field @xmath24 is used , which is the physically more interesting case as it leads to a non - conserved baryonic current featuring the anomaly .",
    "technically , this has come about because of our inability to reduce the topological charge density @xmath134 in this case , analogous to @xmath40 used in the above , to the form      in which @xmath136 is equal to @xmath42 defined by ( [ 2.1 ] ) with @xmath137 , @xmath138 defined at the end of section 1 .",
    "had it turned out possible to establish ( [ 4.4 ] ) , then the topological charge would have been related to @xmath139 , analogous to @xmath140 in ( [ 2.2 ] ) , which would have been the time - like component of the topological baryonic current      used in @xcite , whose divergence @xmath142 does not vanish but is equal to the chiral @xmath143 anomaly .",
    "it would be very interesting if some other version of ( [ 4.4 ] ) could be found , which would lead to a lower bound on the static hamiltonian .    to summarise ,",
    "we have constructed three @xmath0 gauged versions of the @xmath1 sigma model on @xmath2 , characterised by the static hamiltonians ( [ 2.10a ] ) , ( [ 2.10b ] ) and ( [ 2.10c ] ) .",
    "these are equivalent to the corresponding gauged versions of the skyrme model@xcite . models ( [ 2.10a ] ) and ( [ 2.10b])have the feature of breaking the global @xmath1 symmetry of the sigma model , but the latter can be restored by adding suitable positive definite terms to the hamiltonian densities resulting in the model ( [ 2.10c ] ) which was first proposed by faddeev@xcite .",
    "the large @xmath144 asymptotic field configuration of the soliton presented here is @xmath0 symmetric and the magnetic flux of the corresponding field configuration vanishes .",
    "accordingly this soliton model differs from the corresponding @xmath3 higgs model@xcite , in which the asymptotic field configuration is @xmath145 symmetric and exhibits magnetic monopole flux .",
    "these models admit finite energy topologically stable soliton solutions , whose energy is bounded from below by the winding number , which can be interpreted as the baryon number .",
    "this topological bound is saturated by bogomolnyi equations , which however are overdetermined as in the case of the usual ( ungauged ) skyrme model , and hence likewise our solitons are solutions to the full second order euler - lagrange equations .",
    "these were solved analytically only in the asymptotic regions @xmath146 and @xmath147 , and the full integrations were performed numerically .    in the present work ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the spherically symmetric case .",
    "as such the soliton in question carries baryon number @xmath148 .",
    "it would be interesting to find the baryon number @xmath71 _ axially symmetric _ solutions , analogous to the corresponding axially symmetric solutions of the ( ungauged ) skyrme model@xcite .",
    "furthermore , since we know@xcite that for sigma models in odd dimensional spaces there are spherically symmetric solitons of arbitrary baryon number @xmath149 , it would be interesting to study these in the present model .",
    "these higher degree field configurations are characterised by their asymptotic values , which for small @xmath144 differ from ( [ 3.7 ] ) according to @xmath150 it would be interesting to integrate the euler - lagrange equations with the asymptotic conditions ( [ 4.6 ] ) , say with n=2 , and to see whether the energy of that soliton is greater than twice the energy of the @xmath151 soliton , as is the case for the usual ( ungauged ) skyrme model@xcite .",
