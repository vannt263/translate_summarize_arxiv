    "although semiconductor spintronics is a field with already a substantial history as well as with commercial applications,@xcite spintronics with carbon - based materials is a young research area with excellent perspectives . only very recently , a pronounced gate - controlled magnetoresistance response in carbon nanotubes connected to ferromagnetic leads has been reported.@xcite furthermore , spin injection and detection in single - wall carbon nanotubes has been demonstrated using a four - terminal geometry.@xcite the interest to implement spintronic devices with carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes @xcite or graphene @xcite is mainly driven by the desire to improve material properties , for instance , for the spin relaxation behavior in these materials ( as compared to more standard semiconductors like gaas ) .",
    "this is so because carbon is a comparably light atom , thus , spin - orbit interaction is typically weak.@xcite additionally , it consists predominantly of @xmath4c , which has zero nuclear spin , thus , spin decoherence and relaxation caused by the hyperfine interaction of the electron spin with the surrounding nuclear spins is weak .",
    "the advantageous material properties of carbon also trigger a large interest to create spin qubits @xcite in such materials . here , we provide quantitative calculations of spin relaxation and spin decoherence times and show that they are dominated by a combination of spin - orbit and electron - phonon interaction .",
    "it turns out that such spin - orbit induced effects get strongly enhanced in small - radius nanotubes due to the curvature of the lattice , and result in energy splittings that even exceed those occurring in gaas nanostructures .",
    "the interplay of such enhanced spin - orbit interaction with the one - dimensional nature of nanotubes results in a complex behavior with an extremely wide range of relaxation rates which can be varied over many orders of magnitude by an external magnetic field applied along the tube axis .",
    "we show that interference effects can result in _ ultralong _ spin relaxation times exceeding tens of seconds .",
    "by contrast , we uncover that for nanotube quantum dots , a spin - phonon dissipation channel exists with a sub - ohmic spectral function ( @xmath5 , see below ) which results in _ decreasing _ spin relaxation times for decreasing spin level splitting @xmath2 .",
    "compared to standard quantum dots ( such as gaas or inas semiconductors ) this is a most surprising behavior , since usually the spin decay times increase for decreasing @xmath2.@xcite    most remarkably , at zero magnetic field , the spin - orbit interaction induces a zero - field splitting in the energy spectrum .",
    "we show that this opens the door for an all - electrical control of spin in nanotube quantum dots , again based on the strong spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this feature is most interesting for spintronics applications where one aims at a spin manipulation without making use of magnetic fields . since quantum dots in semiconducting carbon nanotubes have been realized by several groups,@xcite we believe that our predictions are well within experimental reach . the paper is organized as follows . in  section  [ sec : teormodel ] , we introduce a theoretical model for a nanotube quantum dot and solve the spectral problem of the hamiltonian of such a system . in  section  [ sec : soi ] , we study spin - orbit coupling in nanotubes , consider different contributions to the spin - orbit coupling , and investigate zero - field - level splitting induced by spin - orbit coupling . in  section  [ sec : elph ] , electron - phonon coupling in nanotubes is considered .",

    "if the soi constant had the opposite sign due to hybridization , then the energy spectrum for electrons would look like the one for holes and vice versa @xcite . hence , in the case of negative @xmath146 , there are crossings of levels for holes and not for electrons ( at @xmath147 ) .",
    "such electron - hole asymmetry in the spectrum can provide us with information about the sign and the magnitude of the soi constant and about the @xmath145-factor .",
    "now , we turn to the quantitative discussion of the spin relaxation time in nanotube quantum dots .",

    "furthermore , the electron wave function is highly localized in the dot region ( it decays exponentially outside the dot ) .",
    "thus , the phonons in the contacts or substrate can be safely ignored for our purposes .",
    "moreover , we neglect the effect of the substrate on the phonon modes .",
    "this is justified due to the relatively weak coupling between the substrate and the nt , very high stiffness and rigidity of a nt , and , last but not least , very small atomic displacement amplitudes in an acoustic phonon wave ( which is a few percents of angstroms only ) .",

    "[ fig : one]a and [ fig : one]b ) .",
    "let us give a physical explanation for this phenomenon .",

    "the terms of the spin - flip matrix element due to coupling to the first exited subband with @xmath182 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_wb2 ] ) ) can be written as follows : @xmath287 note that @xmath288 is a symmetric function of @xmath28 with respect to the center of the nt qd ( @xmath152 ) . in the dot area ( @xmath289 ) , it might be approximated by a function @xmath290 with exponential tails in the classically forbidden areas ( @xmath291 and @xmath292 ) .",
    "in addition to the selection rule eq .",
    "( [ eq : selrules ] ) , it is easy to find that @xmath293 , because @xmath294 is either odd or even with respect to inversion at @xmath152",
    ". therefore , @xmath295 at @xmath296 , since @xmath297 is an asymmetric function with respect to @xmath152 at which it has a node .",

    "after integration over @xmath27 , we could assume that the dependence of @xmath299 on @xmath28 is integrated out , therefore , @xmath280 is a symmetric function of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath152 , which we approximate by @xmath300 defined at @xmath289 . using these assumptions , we get the following estimations : @xmath301     and @xmath280 ( see eq .

    "with increasing the voltage @xmath272 applied to top gates , the number of discrete levels and the spacing between the ground state and the lower bound of the continuous spectrum increases .",
