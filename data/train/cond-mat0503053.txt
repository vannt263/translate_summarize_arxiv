    "the acoustic properties of granular porous materials confined by an external stress can be extremely nonlinear as compared to continuum elastic solids @xcite .",
    "many industrial applications , such as the optimization of well location in an oil reservoir , depend crucially on the correct interpretation of nonlinear acoustic effects in granular materials , as exemplified by the large variation of the sound speeds or the elastic constants of the granular formation as a function of the external stress @xcite .",
    "important insight into this problem comes first from the hertz - mindlin contact theory to model the intergrain forces @xcite . in this case",
    ", nonlinearity arises from the increase with the external stress of the contact area between two spherical grains .",
    "conventional theories describing this problem in the framework of elasticity of continuum media @xcite consider a uniform strain at all scales , and the displacement field of the grains is affine with the macroscopic deformation ( the affine approximation ) . here",
    ", one computes the stresses in terms of the strains by considering the disordered medium as an effective medium that exerts a mean - field force ( as given by contact hertzian theory ) on a single representative grain .",
    "this approximation is usually referred to as the effective medium theory ( emt ) @xcite .    as shown in a short letter @xcite and the studies of other groups @xcite",
    ", the emt does not successfully explain the mechanical properties of cohesionless granular assemblies .",
    "the main prediction of the theory is the scaling of the bulk modulus , @xmath1 , and shear modulus , @xmath2 , with the pressure , @xmath3 , as @xmath4 .",
    "however there is a large volume of experiments for irregular sand grains as well as spherical glass beads which show anomalous scaling characterized by exponents varying between @xmath0 and @xmath5 ( for a comprehensive review see goddard @xcite and for a review in the geotechnical literature see @xcite ) .",
    "some studies have suggested that a @xmath6 scaling is more appropriate for describing the nonlinear variation of the moduli @xcite .",
    "here we extend the results of @xcite and investigate the applicability of elasticity theory to granular matter by means of experiments , computer simulations , and analytical calculations .",
    "we first develop a series of acoustic experiments to characterize the nonlinear elastic behavior of non - cohesive dry granular materials under a wide range of external pressures . from this experimental study",
    "we conclude that a microscopic study is needed in order to elucidate the deficiencies of existing granular theories .",
    "then we perform a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation to give microscopic insight into the relaxation mechanism of granular materials .",
    "finally , we offer a simple theory of relaxation going beyond the effective medium approximation of elasticity .",
    "we calculate the elastic moduli , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , of a disordered array of elasto - frictional hertz - mindlin spherical grains .",
    "numerical simulations resolve the question as to whether the problem lies in the treatment of intergrain contact or with the emt .",
    "we find agreement between our simulations and the experiments , thus confirming the validity of the hertz - mindlin contact theory to glass bead aggregates composed of frictional particles .",
    "regarding the anomalous pressure dependence of the moduli , we find that there are several nonlinearities which preclude the proper definition of a scaling behavior as a function of pressure .",
    "we find a regime at low pressure where the coordination number and the volume fraction do not change much from their minimal values . in this regime",
    "the @xmath7 scaling is approximately valid .",
    "however , for pressures larger than 10 mpa the increase of the coordination number and volume fraction induces other nonlinearities and therefore no simple scaling behavior can be defined .",
    "in reality around 10 mpa there is crossover from a @xmath7 to a @xmath8 scaling at larger pressures .",
    "thus , we conclude that the scattering in the experimental values of the pressure exponent might be explained by the fact that the exponent is actually changing continuously from 1/3 to 5/9 .",
    "this is especially true in the regime where the experiments are usually done , near the crossover region at 10 mpa .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached by luding @xcite who also found that emt needs to take into account the coordination number and its dependence on pressure .",
    "our most important results relate to the effect of friction and stress relaxation on the behavior of the elastic constants .",
    "firstly , we find that the elastic formulation gives a reasonable description for the response of the system to compressional loads , i.e. the bulk modulus is reasonably well defined with the simple emt .",
    "however , our simulations establish that the emt is inadequate in describing the response of the material under shear perturbations .",
    "the numerical simulations indicate that emt fails because it does not properly allow the grains to relax from the affine deformation imposed by the external boundary .",
    "the affine assumption is that , under an infinitesimal symmetric macroscopic deformation , each grain translates according to the direction of the macroscopic strain , and it does not rotate . moreover , no further relaxation mechanism is allowed .",
    "such an homogeneous strain field is consistent with the local force balance of grains only in an ordered system . for disordered packings an inhomogeneous strain develops at the local level .",
    "after the application of an affine strain the particles experience an unbalanced force since they are not , in general , in a symmetric environment .",
    "consequently , the particles will move to a position different to that predicted by the affine approximation , so that the net force on each particle is zero .",
    "similarly for torques and rotations .    here we show that the assumption of affinity is approximately valid for the bulk modulus and seriously flawed for the shear modulus . for this reason ,",
    "the emt prediction differs significantly from the experimental value .",
    "thus , the principal source of deviation from emt is the breakdown of the uniform strain assumption .    to quantify the breakdown of emt for the shear modulus we focus our studies to two cases : frictionless grains interacting via only normal forces ( this system is said to be path - independent and it is thought to describe compressible foams and emulsions ) and systems with elastic tangential forces and coulomb frictional forces ( these systems are path - dependent and describe dry granular materials ) .",
    "the largest disagreement between theory and simulations is found for frictionless systems ; the difference is more pronounced at low confining stress where we show that the system is in a state of marginal rigidity at a minimal mean coordination number equal to 6 in 3d ( or 4 in 2d ) .",
    "we find that after the application of an external shear strain there is a nearly complete relaxation of the system to the applied shear ; a result that can not be captured under the framework of elasticity .",
    "we show that a new scaling behavior with pressure might describe the data for frictionless particles better : @xmath9 as @xmath10 .",
    "we interpret this result in the framework of critical phenomena : as @xmath11 the system approaches a critical point at a mean coordination number @xmath12 in @xmath13 dimensions , and a volume fraction of random close packing @xmath14 .",
    "this point describes a rigidity threshold state or a critical state of the packing as defined by alexander @xcite and it is where the system becomes `` isostatic '' @xcite .",
    "the elastic moduli vanish as a power - law of the pressure or volume fraction . for any finite pressure rigidity",
    "is achieved , since @xmath15 .",
    "near the rigidity threshold the reference packing structure has a power law dependence on the pressure , modifying the scaling of @xmath16 predicted by the hertz theory .",
    "when friction and tangential elasticity is restored at the intergrain contacts , the agreement between theory and simulations ( and in this case experiments ) improves with respect to the frictionless case .",
    "this is because the existence of tangential restoring forces reduces the extent to which the grains relax from the assumed affine configuration .",
    "thus , the emt provides a better agreement with simulations and with experiments for frictional grains than for frictionless grains , but serious disagreements still persist as we shall demonstrate .",
    "we conclude that in order to develop a better understanding of the problem , one must abandon the purely elastic framework and consider granular matter as a full viscoelastic body .",
    "collective relaxation effects can account for the discrepancy in the shear modulus in comparison with the elastic prediction : the corrections increase dramatically in the case of loose materials and for frictionless packings .",
    "a theory of single - particle relaxation is offered as a first step in this direction .",
    "we also discuss our results in the framework of recent theories of marginal rigidity , jamming , melting and fragile matter .    _",
    "applications. _ part of the motivation for",
    "this research derives from the fact that acoustics and nonlinear elastic logging methods are at the forefront of the evolving technology to help plan and optimize well location in oil exploration @xcite . in order to position a well correctly",
    ", the knowledge of the stress distribution around the borehole is essential .",
    "mechanical properties of the granular formation obtained from sonic logging can help predict formation strength , while stress magnitude derived from sonic measurements helps in predicting sanding problems in unconsolidated formations .",
    "acoustic measurements in granular materials provide the natural way to understand the distribution of stress around the borehole .    quite apart from the relevance to borehole logging , within the field of seismic tomography",
    "there is a growing interest in developing techniques to generate images of dissipation , along with the more traditional images of impedance contrast .",
    "this extended seismic tomography would have impact , not only on the understanding of hydrocarbon reservoirs but also e.g. on techniques to monitor the migration of ground water pollutants .",
    "this work represents an attempt to understand some of the mechanisms of attenuation as well as the stress dependence of sound velocities in granular materials .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ back ] reviews the background of the problem of effective medium theories and numerical approaches : md simulations and intergrain forces for granular materials , compressed emulsions and foams .",
    "section [ experiments ] describes the experiments on sound propagation .",
    "section [ numerics ] describes the numerical results and section [ sectheory ] the theoretical results .",
    "we conclude in section [ summary ] with a final outlook .",
    "the problem of elastic properties of granular materials has been treated by many researchers since the pioneering work of mindlin in the 50 s @xcite . however , a general solution to this problem is still lacking .    in a typical experiment , a set of cohesionless glass beads",
    "is confined at a hydrostatic stress , @xmath3 , and the compressional sound speed , @xmath17 , and the shear sound speed , @xmath18 , are measured as functions of stress ( see for instance domenico @xcite , yin @xcite , and @xcite ) . the p - wave and s - wave speeds",
    "are related to the elastic constants of the material in the long - wavelength limit : @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mass density of the system .      in his seminal paper `` on the contact of elastic solids '' h. hertz @xcite used linear elasticity of continuum media to calculate the normal force of two perfectly elastic spheres pressed into contact considering no attraction or stickiness .",
    "hertz showed that two spherical grains in contact with radii @xmath22 and @xmath23 interact with a normal repulsive force    @xmath24    where @xmath25 , the normal overlap is @xmath26>0 $ ] , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the positions of the grain centers .",
    "the normal force acts only in compression , @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "the effective stiffness @xmath31 is defined in terms of the shear modulus of the grains @xmath32 and the poisson ratio @xmath33 of the material from which the grains are made ( typically @xmath34 gpa and @xmath35 , for spherical glass beads ) .",
    "the situation in the presence of a tangential force , @xmath36 , is more complicated . in the case of spheres under oblique loading ,",
    "the tangential contact force was first calculated by mindlin @xcite .",
    "a general loading history can be described by the incremental change in the tangential force @xmath37 and in the normal force @xmath38 . for the special case where the partial increments do not involve microslip at the contact surface ( i.e. , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the kinematic friction coefficient between the spheres , typically @xmath41 ) mindlin @xcite showed that the tangential force is @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and the variable @xmath44 is defined such that the relative shear displacement between the two grain centers is @xmath45 .",
    "this is called the mindlin `` no - slip '' solution .",
    "[ see appendix a for a more general solution ] .",
    "the incremental form eq .",
    "( [ ft ] ) is needed since the numerical value of the tangential force depends upon the trajectory taken in the space ( @xmath46 ) , see @xcite for details .",
    "the tangential force is obtained by integrating over the path taken by the spheres in contact subject to the initial conditions : @xmath47 , @xmath48 at @xmath49 , yielding :    @xmath50    thus , a granular system with tangential elastic forces is said to be path - dependent . by path dependency",
    "we mean that the work done in deforming the system depends upon whether one first compresses the system , then shears it , or first shears it then compresses .",
    "the results depend upon the path taken and not just the instantaneous final state . on the other hand , a system of spheres interacting only via normal forces , eq .",
    "( [ fn ] ) , is said to be path - independent , and the work does not depend on the way the strain is applied .    as the shear displacement increases",
    ", the elastic tangential force @xmath36 reaches its limiting value given by amontons law for no adhesion , @xmath51 .",
    "amontons law ( a special case of coulomb s law ) adds a second source of path - dependency as well as hysteresis to the problem .",
    "the basic idea of elastic theories relevant to our study is that the macroscopic work done in deforming the system is set equal to the sum of the work done on each grain - grain contact and that the latter is replaced by a suitable average @xcite .",
    "these theories are usually referred to as the effective medium theory ( emt ) and are based on hertz - mindlin contact mechanics . in the case of an isotropic deformable solid ( for simplicity we describe the isotropic case ) , the strain energy density per unit volume as a function of the strain @xmath52 is : @xmath53 this equation is equivalent to the expression @xmath54 which determines the stress tensor @xmath55 in terms of the strain tensor for an isotropic body @xcite .",
    "here @xmath56 and the deviations @xmath57 of the positions of the @xmath58 particles in the system , * \\{x@xmath59 x@xmath60 } * , are measured from a suitable rigid reference state @xmath61 around which one can expand consistently .",
    "this reference state is straightforward for simple periodic systems .",
    "however , it is assumed that this expansion is also possible for amorphous solids with reference states which are random , like in a packing of grains ( see alexander @xcite for extensive discussions ) .",
    "the subscript in @xmath62 and @xmath63 denotes that the values of the moduli are calculated considering granular materials as purely elastic solids .",
    "there are two assumptions inherent to the elastic emt :    * all the spheres are statistically the same , and it is assumed that there is an isotropic distribution of contacts around a given sphere . *",
    "an affine approximation is used , i.e. , the spheres at position @xmath64 are moved a distance @xmath65 in a time interval @xmath66 according to the macroscopic strain rate @xmath67 by @xmath68 the grains are always at equilibrium due to the assumption of an isotropic distribution of contacts , and further relaxation is not required .",
    "this sort of mean field theory is analogous to a simple average of non - linear spring constants .",
    "it is important to notice that a definition of uniform strain field is possible only under the mean field approximation .",
    "this assumption is also trivially correct for ordered packings .",
    "however , for disordered systems , the affine approximation is inconsistent with the local equilibrium of grains @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this crucial point later on .    with the above assumptions , the elastic energy eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is set equal to a suitable average over the contacts , viz :    @xmath69    with @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the average coordination number defined as the average number of contacts per particle , @xmath72 is the volume fraction of the sample , and @xmath73 is the volume of a single grain .",
    "the emt predictions for the bulk and shear modulus for an isotropic system compressed at pressure @xmath3 are the following :    we distinguish between two different models :     ( 1)_path - independent models , @xmath74 , frictionless grains _ : we consider that there is perfect slippage at the intergrain contact .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath75 , only normal forces between the particles .",
    "this case corresponds to path - independent forces , and allows the use of an energy density function eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) which depends only on the instantaneous position of the particles .",
    "this case could be considered conservative since the total work on a closed path is zero .",
    "a system of frictionless spherical particles could be thought of as a model of compressed emulsions and foams which are usually modeled as viscoelastic spheres without tangential forces @xcite ( see appendix c ) .    for the case of frictionless grains",
    "one finds :    @xmath76    @xmath77    \\(2 ) _ path - dependent models , @xmath78 , frictional grains _ : in this case tangential elastic forces are taken into consideration . in principle the energy functional ( [ energy ] ) now depends on the path .",
    "however , it has been shown that the second order elastic constants are still path - independent under the framework of emt , while path - dependency appears only in the third order elastic constants @xcite .",
    "the bulk modulus is not affected by the introduction of tangential forces , and eq .",
    "( [ emt_k ] ) is still valid in this case .",
    "however , the shear modulus is modified according to : @xmath79    the above results have been obtained by a number of authors using different methods and are valid in 3-d @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the above results are obtained for a system of infinitely rough spheres , i.e. when @xmath80 .",
    "thus , there is no sliding , and coulomb friction is not considered , although there is a tangential elastic restoring force as given by eq .",
    "( [ ft ] ) .",
    "see appendix a for further discussion .    the @xmath7 dependence in eqs .",
    "( [ emt_k])-([emt_mu2 ] ) is a direct consequence of the scaling of the normal hertz force on the deformation . since @xmath81 then we expect @xmath82    we note that a system of linear springs , @xmath83 , would give rise to elastic constants which are independent of pressure , as in the linear elasticity theory .",
    "it was found experimentally that the shear and bulk moduli of an assembly of spherical grains vary with the confining stress , @xmath3 , faster than the @xmath7 power law predicted by eqs .",
    "( [ emt_k])-([emt_mu2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "another way of seeing the breakdown of the elastic theory is to focus on the ratio @xmath84 . according to eqs .",
    "( [ emt_k ] ) and ( [ emt_mu2 ] ) for frictional grains @xmath85 independent of stress , a value which depends only on the poisson ratio of the bead material .",

    "another quantity of interest is the effective poisson ratio of the pack @xmath94 . according to emt ,",
    "@xmath95 is again independent of pressure and given only in terms of the poisson s ratio of the grains : @xmath96    thus , for typical glass beads ( @xmath88 ) we find a predicted value of @xmath97 which is one order of magnitude smaller than typical experimental values @xmath98 @xcite ; another serious disagreement .",
    "the origin of the above discrepancies has not been clear : it could be due to the breakdown of the hertz - mindlin force law at each grain contact , or it could be associated with the breakdown of the elasticity theory applied to granular systems .",
    "de gennes @xcite proposed that a thin shell of oxide layer would give a faster growth with stress of the elastic moduli of the system , which may explain the behavior for metallic beads .",
    "goddard @xcite proposed that sharp angularities of the grains ( for instance sand grains ) may modify the contact force law between grains , giving rise to a different stress dependence . other authors @xcite have suggested that the increasing number of contacts with stress may be the reason for the discrepancies in the stress dependence of the moduli .",
    "@xcite measured the elastic moduli using numerical simulations for a single pressure and concluded that emt does not correctly describe the shear modulus but it describes the bulk modulus fairly well . other experimental work done by liu and nagel @xcite and jia _ et al .",

    "different approaches for one dimensional elastic chains have also been applied to wave propagation in granular media @xcite .      in order to understand our results",
    "it is important to generalize the elastic concepts introduced above to the full viscoelastic response . in linear viscoelasticity @xcite , the current state of stress specified by the stress tensor @xmath55",
    "is determined by the past history via a linear constitutive equation @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the strain rate , and @xmath101 is called the relaxation modulus tensor .    for an isotropic linear viscoelastic material ,",

    "the relaxation modulus is independent of time , @xmath112constant , and one can define the shear modulus of the solid as @xmath113 we will show that the instantaneous response of the viscoelastic granular material , @xmath114 , represents the shear modulus , @xmath63 , as calculated by the effective medium theories of continuum elasticity .    for a newtonian liquid @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the viscosity . for a viscoelastic liquid , @xmath102 approaches zero as @xmath117 . for a viscoelastic solid , structural relaxation and elasticity lead to a finite modulus as @xmath118 : @xmath119 a similar analysis can be performed for the bulk modulus , @xmath103 defined as @xmath120 to obtain @xmath121 and    @xmath122    equations ( [ mu1 ] ) and ( [ k1 ] ) will be used to calculate the moduli in the simulations .      in md simulations of granular matter the net force and moment on each grain depend on the choice of intergrain contact laws @xcite . here",

    "first , however , we wish to eliminate a conceptually simpler effect of disorder as the explanation for the behavior of @xmath16 . in the simulations ( and presumably in the experiments ) , it is not true that each grain has the same number of contacts . rather , there is a distribution of contacts ranging from @xmath220 to @xmath221 with a peak at @xmath222 , which is near the average ( @xmath223 at 100 kpa ) .",

    "the response is then purely elastic .",
    "on the contrary , in the md simulations ( and in the experiments ) after the application of an affine perturbation via the motion of the boundaries and grains , the beads in the immediate neighborhood of each grain move around , relative to the center grain , in a way which gives rise to a stress relaxation associated with these rearrangements of particles .",

    "figure [ zeta ] shows the result of @xmath275 for @xmath217 kpa and @xmath259 and should be compared with fig . 4 in @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the 2d results of @xcite we find no evidence of a bimodal distribution of forces which would give rise to a percolation - like behavior of the shear modulus .",
    "we see that the shear modulus and the coordination number increase continuously as we increase @xmath271 .",
    "we also repeat the same calculations for our two - dimensional packings and find the same result as in 3d , i.e. we find no evidence of a bimodal character in the behavior of the shear modulus versus the force cut - off . the fact that we do not see the same behavior in 2d as in @xcite",
    "might be related to the regularization scheme used in our md simulations to handle the frictional forces which may eliminate the critical behavior found in @xcite .",
    "_ used a contact dynamics algorithm which tackle the non - smooth character of the interactions without any regularization schemes .",
    "figure [ chains ] shows our attempt to visualize force chains in 3d packings ( a ) without friction under isotropic compression , ( b ) with friction under uniaxial compression and ( c ) in 2d frictional isotropic packings .",
    "force chains are not prominent in the 3d isotropic frictionless packing",
    ". moreover , the continuous variation of @xmath275 obtained for this packing seems to indicate that all forces are important for the mechanical response to shear , and not just the larger forces which may be organized in force chains .",
    "however , force chains are prominent in the 3d packing under uniaxial compression and the 2d packing .",
    "since the difficulty with the shear modulus is shown to be due to the relaxation of the particles from the initial uniform strain approximation , we next perform the simplest investigation that allows for some relaxation . from the simulations , we know the rest positions of each of the particles , as well as the contact vectors @xmath276 ( the vector from a particle to each of the particles with which it is in contact ) .",
    "consider a specific particle .",
    "we make the approximation that when a small amplitude macroscopic strain is applied its contacting particles move according to the affine approximation .",
    "the particle will experience an unbalanced force and an unbalanced torque .",
    "accordingly , it will relax to a new position and orientation such that the net force and torque on it become zero .",
    "so , for the specific particle we calculate its new position and orientation .",
    "we next calculate the energy stored within each of the contact  springs \" .",
    "we do this for each of the particles in the simulation to calculate the total stored energy due to the applied strain and we set this equal to the usual expression for strain energy in order to deduce the new estimates for the bulk and shear moduli of the aggregate .",

    "it has @xmath278 contacts at the positions @xmath279 . assuming that one of the contact points is displaced by an amount @xmath280 the increment in the intergrain force at contact @xmath281 is    @xmath282 + \\alpha k_t [ ( { \\bf i } - \\hat{\\bf d}^{(q)}\\hat{\\bf d}^{(q ) } ) \\cdot { \\bf u}^{(q ) } ] , \\label{d1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath283 and @xmath284 are given by : @xmath285 @xmath286 and @xmath287 is the normal displacement which can be related to the external pressure through the average affine approximation @xcite by @xmath288^{2/3}.\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath216 allows us to continuously investigate the crossover behavior from perfect slip ( @xmath212 ) to perfect stick ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "as written , the total force on the specific particle , due to the sum of all the contact forces is not zero : @xmath289 accordingly , that particle will move to a new equilibrium position , @xmath290 .",
    "similarly , the net torque on the particle is unbalanced :    @xmath291    accordingly , the particle will rotate through an angle @xmath292 to a new orientation .",
    "the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) that takes into account the new position and orientation is    @xmath293 + \\\\ & \\alpha k_t [ ( { \\bf i } - \\hat{\\bf d}^{(q)}\\hat{\\bf d}^{(q ) } ) \\cdot ( { \\bf u}^{(q)}-{\\bf x})- { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\omega$}}}\\times{\\bf d}^{(q ) } ] , \\end{array } \\label{d6}\\ ] ]    now , the requirement that the particle is in equilibrium with its contact forces , @xmath294 , gives three linear equations in the six unknowns , @xmath292 and @xmath295 .",
    "the requirement that the total torque must vanish , @xmath296 , gives the remaining three .",
    "it is straightforward to solve these equations numerically .",
    "having determined the new equilibrium position and orientation , one can show that the total work done by the contact forces on the @xmath277-th particle is simply @xmath297 @xmath298 and @xmath292 are determined as described above . in order to calculate @xmath299",
    "we make the affine assumption , that the displacement at the contact point is simply related to the macroscopic strain by eq .",
    "( [ affine ] ) . since we know the exact positions of each contact vector , @xmath300 , from the simulations , we are able to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ d7 ] ) for each particle in the ensemble .",

    "( [ energy ] ) , in order to deduce the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the above procedure can only reduce the moduli relative to those of the effective medium prediction . if , in eq .",
    "( [ d7 ] ) , we assume there is no relaxation [ @xmath302 and @xmath303 , and if we replace the sum over contacts by an integral over a presumed uniform distribution of contact directions , we reproduce the effective medium theory , eqs .",

    "the results of such a calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ theory ] , which is to be compared to fig .",
    "[ alpha ] .",
    "the static confining pressure is 100 kpa .",
    "we see that , relative to the effective medium prediction , there is a small reduction of the bulk modulus , which is relatively insensitive to @xmath216 .",
    "there is a much larger reduction of the shear modulus but the results of the simulations for the shear modulus give values that are even smaller still . for @xmath260 ( perfect slip )",
    "the simulations give @xmath304 mpa , which is essentially indistinguishable from zero , whereas from figure [ theory ] we have a value of 100 mpa .",
    "we see that relaxation effects at the single particle level , while significant , are by no means sufficient to explain the effect . in the fully frictional case of @xmath213",
    "there is a reduction relative to the emt but the simulation gives a value of @xmath305 mpa .",
    "( [ theory ] ) we have extended the calculations into the unphysical range of @xmath306 to emphasize that there is a slight change of slope , relative to the emt . )",
    "we are thus lead to consider a more sophisticated theory in which we explicitly account for collective fluctuations .",
    "the next step in this direction is developed in @xcite where we introduce fluctuations in pairs of contacting particles .",
    "this theory is developed for the frictionless case , where the reduction in shear modulus is most dramatic and for which we can derive an analytic result using some fairly weak assumptions .",
    "where do we go from here ?",
    "we clearly need new theoretical frameworks to describe the collective relaxation of granular materials , especially under shear and for frictionless packs .",
    "below we give a short review of some of the ideas that have been proposed recently , and how these theories are related to our results .",
    "we have seen that the impossibility of defining a strain field which is inhomogeneous at the level of the grain is at the root of the problems of the elastic theory : the emt approach relies on the assumption of a uniform strain field at all scales @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent studies @xcite have proposed theories of stress transmission in granular packs which describe the internal stresses without resorting to the use of strain variables , as in elasticity theory .",
    "these groups argue that cohesionless grains are in a `` fragile state '' of marginal rigidity or isostatic at a minimal coordination number @xmath162 and they are only able to support certain loads without severe rearrangements .",
    "a novel closure relation between stress components for instance , the fixed principal axis ansatz and not between stress and strain as in elasticity has been proposed to solve for the indeterminacy in the granular system @xcite .",
    "the correct type of closure relation ( elastic or fragile ) is still a question of much debate @xcite , although there are recent experiments on the single - particle green function measurements suggesting that the elastic framework might be the correct approach at large scales @xcite .    in the case of collective relaxation dynamics ,",
    "our results show that the elastic formulation is erroneous in describing the macroscopic shear response of granular materials . moreover , we find that a very small shear modulus appears for frictionless packs .",
    "this shear modulus decreases towards zero as @xmath10 , as @xmath307 , and as the system approaches the isostatic limit of @xmath308 .",
    "the vanishing of the shear modulus could be interpreted as a `` fragile '' behavior . in the limit @xmath309",
    "a packing of nearly rigid particles responds to an external isotropic load with an elastic deformation and a finite @xmath1 , since the external perturbation is compatible with the principal axes of the stress predetermined by the preparation history of the sample .",
    "by contrast , such a system can not support a shear load ( @xmath310 ) without severe particle rearrangements .",
    "thus the granular system supports , elastically , only perturbations compatible with the structure of force chains and deform irreversibly otherwise , i.e. it is in a `` fragile '' state .",
    "our results show that the fragile limit is approached as the system gets closer to rcp limit , and that at rcp there is a jamming transition between a liquid - like state and a solid - like state with a finite modulus .",
    "the approach to the critical point is characterized by several power - law exponents as in a second - order phase transition .",
    "the vanishing of the shear modulus can be understood as a melting of the system occurring when the system approaches the isostatic point .",
    "this fluid like behavior has similarities with melting transitions found in compressed emulsions , and foams @xcite near the rcp fraction . a slow relaxation time and the increase of the correlation length between force chains is found near rcp .",
    "this behavior indicates that the physics of granular materials might be closely related to other complex systems undergoing jamming as proposed recently @xcite such as glasses , colloids , foams , and emulsions .",
    "our md simulations are in good agreement with the available experimental data on the pressure dependence of the elastic moduli of granular packings .",
    "they also serve to clarify the deficiencies of emt .",
    "grain relaxation after an infinitesimal affine strain transformation is an essential component of the shear ( but not the bulk ) modulus .",
    "this relaxation is not taken into account in the emt .",
    "clearly , there is a need for alternative theories to describe granular packings .",
    "recent work on stress transmission in minimally connected networks may provide an alternative formulation and allow a proper description of the response of granular materials to external perturbations .    acknowledgments : this work was supported by the doe , chemical sciences , geosciences and biosciences division , and the nsf , division of materials research .",

    "first , we consider the no - slip solution of mindlin for the tangential force , and we consider total slip of the contact area only when the total tangential force exceed @xmath311 .",
    "however , in reality , the contact may slip over an annular ring of the contact area for any finite value of the tangential force . a general study for several loading histories considering that microslip occurs , i.e. , @xmath312 , was performed by mindlin - deresiewicz @xcite and analyzed in more detail by thornton and randall @xcite .",
    "they showed that the incremental tangential force can be obtained as : @xmath313 where @xmath314 when microslip does not occur ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath315 takes different values depending on the path loading history of loading , unloading and reloading @xcite .",
    "we have done preliminary tests using this more general solution of the tangential force , and found no significant changes in comparison with the results obtained with the no - slip solution of mindlin .",
    "therefore , we have performed our simulations using the simpler mindlin contact theory . besides",
    ", the emt calculations are done using hertz - mindlin forces , so that we want to use the same interparticle laws for a better comparison between numerics and theory .",
    "second , while rotation of spherical grains is allowed in the simulations , it is customary to model rotations without resistance against rolling at the contacts @xcite . regarding this approximation ,",
    "it should be pointed out that some recent studies @xcite showed that resistance against rolling ( modeled as an elastic spring yielding rotational resistance @xmath316 , where @xmath317 is the rotational stiffness , and @xmath318 is the relative rotation by rolling ) might be relevant for modeling shear bands .",
    "the relevancy of rotational resistance to static packings has not been determined yet , and therefore , we do not include it in our studies .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the simulations consider resistance against shear given by the elastic tangential force of mindlin .",
    "recently it has been shown that in order to incorporate the dissipation law leading to inelasticity at the grain - grain contact consistent with the hertz contact law , a nonlinear force dependency on the relative velocity of the grains in contact has to be incorporated into the contact law @xcite .",
    "this dissipative part of the normal force has been determined recently by brilliantov _",
    "@xcite as : @xmath319 where @xmath320 is a relaxation time that depends on the viscous properties of the grain material , and it can be uniquely determined from experimental measurements of the coefficient of restitution for spherical beads @xcite .    in our studies , we are not interested in the way the system approaches the equilibrium state , but only in the final state which is supposed to be independent on the type of damping used .",
    "thus , we use the more efficient global damping and linear contact damping described in section [ md ] . however , for dynamical studies a damping term as in eq .",
    "( [ dissip ] ) should be considered as well .      in the case of emulsions , interdroplet forces",
    "are not given in terms of bulk elasticity as in hertz theory .",
    "instead , forces are given by the principles of interfacial mechanics without considering shear forces @xcite .",
    "for small deformations with respect to the droplet surface area , the energy of the applied stress is presumed to be stored in the deformation of the surface .",
    "hence , at the microscopic level , two spherical droplets in contact interact with a normal repulsive force @xmath321 .",
    "this is the so - called princen model @xcite , where @xmath320 is the area of deformation , and @xmath132 is the interfacial tension of the droplets , and @xmath322 is the geometric mean of the radii of the undeformed droplets .",
    "since the area of deformation is proportional to overlap @xmath287 , then the interdroplet interaction is @xmath323 .",
    "there have been more detailed numerical simulations @xcite to improve on this model and allow for anharmonicity in the droplet response by also taking into consideration the number of contacts by which the droplet is confined .",
    "typically these improved models lead to a force law for small deformations of the form @xmath324 , where @xmath320 is the area of deformation and @xmath325 is a coordination number dependent exponent ranging from 1 ( princen model ) to 3/2 ( hertz model ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the time step is usually chosen much smaller than the collision time .",
    "however , since each contact is enduring , the collision time is extremely large and other conditions must be used . besides , the collision time for hertz spheres depends on the relative velocities of the particle , thus it does not defined a fixed time scale @xcite .",
    "we choose the time step to be a fraction of the time that it takes for a sound wave to propagate on the grain .",
    "moreover , the quasi - static approximation used to calculate the hertz force is valid only when the relative velocities of the particles is smaller than the speed of sound in the grains @xcite .",
    "thus , the characteristic time is @xmath326 .",
    "typically , one chooses a time interval much smaller than the characteristic time , then @xmath327 with @xmath328 .",
    "typical values for glass beads are : @xmath329",
    "kg / m@xmath330 , @xmath331 gpa , @xmath332 mm",
    ". then @xmath129 should be smaller than @xmath333 s. thus , in order to perform a simulation over one second , more than @xmath334 md steps are needed , which is obviously a very intensive computation . in this case , it is customary to increase the density or decrease the rigidity of the particles to allow for a larger time step to integrate the equations of motion over realistic periods of time .",
    "if the shear modulus of the grains in decreased , then it should be checked that the resulting stresses are several order of magnitude smaller than @xmath32 , thus ensuring the condition of a nearly rigid system even though @xmath32 is taken smaller to obtain larger time steps .",
    "here we show the results for the bulk and shear modulus as a function of the pressure for a two - dimensional pack of spherical particles interacting via hertz - mindlin forces .",
    "the 2d simulations are done with spherical hertz - mindlin balls constraint to move in a plane .",
    "thus the interparticle force is that of the 3d case .",
    "our system is not the same as a packing of disks in 2d since the latter has a different interaction law between particles .",
    "our results are analogous to the three - dimensional case shown in fig .",
    "[ mu_1/3 ] .",
    "all the conclusions regarding the moduli obtained for 3d are valid in this case as well .              with a critical value of @xmath338 , which is the rcp limit in 2d .",
    "this latter exponent is in disagreement with a mean field prediction based on the contact law , which would imply an exponent 2/3 [ see discussion after eq .",
    "( [ phi - p ] ) ] .",
    "however , we notice the large error bar of this result since we have only five data points . we refer to @xcite for a more systematic study of this problem ."
