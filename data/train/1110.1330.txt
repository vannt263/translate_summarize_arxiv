    "the opera collaboration has reported that it has measured a superluminal speed of muon neutrinos  @xcite . the cngs beam of muon neutrinos with mean energy 17.5 gev with an energy spread about 50 gev travels from cern to the opera detector in the gran sasso laboratory , a distance of 730 km .",
    "the opera group claims that their experiment gives a travel time for the ultrarelativistic neutrinos that is about 60 ns less than expected when compared to the speed of light .",
    "this suggests that neutrinos propagate with superluminal speed with @xmath9 , where @xmath1 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "this is a significant discrepancy of order 7.3 km / sec compared to the experimentally measured speed of light .",
    "the opera result can be expressed in terms of the parameter @xmath10 , and for opera @xmath11 .",
    "the result is compatible with earlier experiments of high energy neutrinos e.g. , minos  @xcite which gave @xmath12 .",
    "it is in serious discord with the observations of @xmath13 mev neutrinos from supernova sn1987a , which yield the constraint @xmath14",
    "oscillating neutrino experiments provide significant constraints , which would require that if the opera result is correct , then the superluminal speed of neutrinos must apply to all three flavors of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "we can consider superluminal tachyons as obeying standard lorentz invariant transformation laws between inertial frames . if we write for @xmath15 that the relative speed between inertial frames is @xmath16 , then the lorentz dilation factor @xmath17 becomes @xmath18 and the energy @xmath19 and rest energy @xmath20 remain real quantities .",
    "however , now a particle is accelerated to ever increasing speeds as @xmath21 and this signals a severe instability of physics and the vacuum . as has been pointed out by cohen and glashow  @xcite , this would lead to serious disagreement with particle physics phenomena .",
    "for example , the energy depletion due to tachyon cherenkov - type bremsstrahlung radiation @xmath22 would predict that few , if any , neutrinos would reach the gran sasso detector with energies in excess of 12.5 gev .",
    "this result can not be reconciled with the opera claim for superluminal neutrino speed measurement .",
    "further stringent constraints from the icecube collaboration for shower energies 16 gev  @xcite yield @xmath23 and for energies of order 100 tev they report @xmath24 .    in view of the experimental evidence refuting tachyon neutrinos  @xcite , we may simply dismiss the opera claim of superluminal neutrinos .",
    "however , the opera result is so remarkable that we are tempted into studying whether there is a theoretical possibility to explain the opera result without violating the constraints of known particle physics and astrophysical experiments . in the following , we appeal to a model of spacetime for which local special relativity is violated  @xcite by the introduction of two metrics , a metric @xmath2 along the light cone of which gravitons and photons travel with the speed @xmath1 , and a second `` matter '' metric @xmath25 in which massive particles can be influenced by a speed @xmath4 . in this picture of spacetime",
    ", matter particles never exceed the speed @xmath26 and become tachyonic .",
    "we shall construct a model in which spacetime has two metrics and two light cones .",
    "we introduce a vector field @xmath7 which relates the gravitational and electromagnetic metric @xmath2 and the matter metric @xmath27 by  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "the class of models we consider is described by the action @xmath30+s_\\psi[\\psi , g ] + s_{\\rm em}[g , a]+s_{\\rm m}[\\hat{g},{\\rm matter\\ , fields}],\\ ] ] where @xmath31=-\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\int d^4x\\sqrt{-g}(r[g]-2\\lambda),\\ ] ] is the usual einstein - hilbert action , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the cosmological constant .",
    "the idea here is to present a model that embodies the physical content of a `` varying speed of light '' in a diffeomorphism invariant manner .",
    "we assume a proca action for the vector field @xmath7 : @xmath34=\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\int d^4x\\sqrt{-g}\\biggl(-\\frac{1}{4}g^{\\mu\\nu}g^{\\alpha\\beta}b_{\\mu\\alpha}b_{\\nu\\beta}+\\frac{1}{2}m^2\\psi^2\\biggr),\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , the electromagnetic field action is @xmath37=-\\int d^4x\\sqrt{-g}\\biggl(\\frac{1}{4}g^{\\mu\\nu}g^{\\alpha\\beta}f_{\\mu\\alpha}f_{\\nu\\beta}\\biggr),\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .",
    "the fact that photons travel along the light cone @xmath39 guarantees that maxwell s equations retain their conformal invariance and that we always measure by electromagnetic experiments the standard speed of light @xmath1 in vacuum .",
    "we assume that _ massless gravitons and photons _ travel along the null cone determined by @xmath39 .",
    "matter particles in the metric @xmath2 obey the condition @xmath40 .",
    "when the gauge field @xmath7 becomes non - zero , then particles with non - vanishing mass can now have @xmath41 with the speed @xmath26 determined by the null cone @xmath42 .",
    "the gravitational metric field , the vector field @xmath7 propagate on the geometry described by @xmath2 , whereas all other matter fields will propagate on the geometry described by @xmath27 .",
    "thus if we consider the motion of a non - gravitational matter test particle , we assume that it is the geodesics of @xmath27 that are of physical interest .",

    "gauge vector field @xmath7 , we could invoke a stuekelberg formalism that would make the action @xmath46 $ ] gauge invariant and the quantized theory for the proca action renormalizable , if we assume that the gravitational metric @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the minkowski metric of spacetime  @xcite . ]",
    "we could have considered a model in which the matter metric @xmath25 is given by  @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a scalar field .",
    "we shall consider for the present the bimetric model based on the gauge field @xmath7 , for vector gauge fields exist in the standard model of particles .",
    "variation of  ( [ totalaction ] ) with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath7 leads to the field equations : @xmath51-\\lambda g^{\\mu\\nu})=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{-g}t_b^{\\mu\\nu}[g,\\psi]+\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{-g}t_{\\rm em}^{\\mu\\nu}[g , a ] + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\sqrt{-\\hat{g}}t^{\\mu\\nu}_{\\rm m}[\\hat{g}],\\\\\\ ] ] @xmath52\\psi_\\nu,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 denotes the covariant derivative formed from the @xmath2 metric connection .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 and @xmath55    it can be shown that the field equations and matter conservation laws are consistent with the bianchi identities .",
    "the field equations  ( [ vectorfeq ] ) have the important property that @xmath56 is always a solution regardless of the matter content of spacetime , in which case the conventional general relativity coupled to matter models are realized and there is no conflict with experiment . in regions of spacetime where @xmath7 is nonvanishing and @xmath57 , we can restrict ourselves to frames that are aligned with the vector field : @xmath58 , and we have reduced the gauge group of the orthonormal frames to @xmath59 . thus we see that @xmath60 can play the role of a _ vacuum condensate _ @xmath61 that can be said to spontaneously ` break ' local lorentz invariance  @xcite .",
    "the model that we have introduced here is a `` metric theory of gravity '' in the sense that all fields with massive particles respond to the metric @xmath27 .",
    "the dynamics that determine @xmath27 involve the tensor @xmath2 as well as the vector @xmath7 and therefore preferred frame effects are possible .",
    "we expect that the vector field will essentially lead to repulsive effects ( the presence of @xmath7 locally increases the speed of matter propagation , thereby effectively decreasing the gravitational coupling to the matter ) .",
    "the magnitude of the vector field is dependent upon the local matter energy density .",
    "the local special relativity metric is given by @xmath47 with @xmath62 where ( @xmath63 ) and we have used the metric signature @xmath64 .",
    "the matter metric is @xmath65 the latter can be written as @xmath66 we have .",
    "this corresponds to being able to choose units in which rigid ruler and clock measurements yield @xmath67 . in the bimetric relativity theory ,",
    "we can not simultaneously remove the time dependence of @xmath26 and @xmath1 by performing a diffeomorphism transformation . if we choose @xmath1 to be constant , then the time dependence of @xmath26 is non - trivially realized . ] @xmath68 we see that the speed @xmath26 in the matter metric is space and time dependent .",
    "the null cone equation @xmath69 describes gravitational and electromagnetic wave signals moving with the constant measured speed @xmath1 , whereas @xmath70 can not be satisfied along the same null cone lines , but determines an expanded null cone with the speed @xmath4 . the bimetric null cone structure is described in fig.1 . 0.2 in        0.1 in    fig .",
    "1 . bimetric light cones showing the timelike travel of neutrinos from a to b between the graviton - photon and matter metric light cones .    0.1 true in    we postulate that the metric ( [ srm ] ) is invariant under _ local _ , so that we can restrict our attention to local lorentz transformations .",
    "] lorentz transformations @xmath71 where @xmath72 are constant matrix coefficients which satisfy the orthogonality condition @xmath73 the matter metric @xmath25 is not invariant under local lorentz transformations .",
    "the ` physical ' matter metric @xmath25 describes the geometry in which standard model massive particles propagate and interact with a value of the speed @xmath74 . because all particle matter fields are coupled to the same metric @xmath25 in the same way , the weak equivalence principle is satisfied in this metric frame .",
    "however , because @xmath25 does not couple to matter in the same way as in gr unless @xmath56 , the strong equivalence principle is not satisfied .",
    "we now consider the propagation of fermions in the matter metric spacetime ( [ mattermetric ] ) in the presence of the background gauge field @xmath7 .",
    "such models have been considered in the context of lorentz violating models  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 is a lorentz violating mass scale .",
    "one may now have fermions with velocities @xmath78 depending on the strength of the coupling constants @xmath79 .",
    "we know that for the electron , @xmath80 to a precision of at least @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "we assume that only the ( vector - axialvector ) coupling constant for neutrinos @xmath82 is sufficiently big to couple to the background field @xmath7 .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath7 are given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 we have assumed that the source current is the baryon charge current @xmath85 and that the baryon charge @xmath86 is @xmath87 here , @xmath88 is determined by the earth s baryon charge , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the mass of the proton .    by adopting the condition @xmath91 the equations of motion become @xmath92 the static spherically symmetric point particle solution for @xmath93 is @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the distance scale that determines the magnitude of @xmath96 as a function of radius @xmath97 .",
    "we can now reconcile the opera neutrino results with the sn1987a data constraints by requiring that @xmath98 , while for sn1987a , @xmath99 , so that @xmath100 and for neutrinos emitted from sn1987a , @xmath101 . an experimental test that can check the tof of the neutrinos can now be proposed .",
    "since the difference @xmath102 depends on the magnitude of the background field @xmath7 , and this magnitude is dependent on @xmath97 , then directing the neutrino pulses through the earth instead across its surface would decrease the altitude of the neutrino pulses and increase the size of @xmath103 and increase the muon neutrino velocity @xmath104 .",
    "a bimetric theory is proposed in which two metrics are associated with spacetime .",
    "gravitons and photons travel along the the null cone of the metric @xmath2 and for @xmath56 matter particles obey @xmath105 . for a non - zero background gauge field",
    "@xmath7 , the speed @xmath26 can exceed @xmath1 and matter particles traveling in the metric @xmath25 spacetime can now have @xmath41 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath93 determines the size @xmath103 of the increase in the speed @xmath1 .",
    "superluminal tachyon neutrinos are prevented from existing , for the neutrino velocity @xmath6 and the lorentz dilation factor becomes @xmath106 in the metric @xmath25 .",
    "the reason that the sn1987a data with its lower energy @xmath13 mev is consistent with @xmath101 is due to the distance dependence of the gauge field strength @xmath107 . for the supernova sn1987a @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    "this suggests that by altering the altitude of the opera neutrino pulses through the earth a detectable distance effect could be measured for @xmath110 . a neutrino detector on a spacecraft or on the moon",
    "could also be utilized to test the distance dependence of @xmath104 .",
    "the striking experimental result reported by the opera experiment requires a speculative theoretical explanation requiring a violation of lorentz invariance and possibly a novel way of describing the geometrical structure of spacetime .",
    "experiments are obviously required to be performed to confirm the opera result and hopefully they can be carried out with sufficient precision in the not too distant future .",
