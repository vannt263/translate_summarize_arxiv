    "hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) is a major tracer of dense molecular gas in space .",
    "it decays fast in its rotational energy ladder , 300 times faster than carbon monoxide , because of its large dipole moment .",
    "rotationally excited hcn therefore suggests an excitation mechanism fast enough to counter the decay , such as frequent collisions with interstellar  in dense molecular gas .",
    "hcn or any molecule with a large dipole moment , however , will not trace dense gas if there is another excitation mechanism that is faster than the  collisions and independent of gas density .",
    "one such excitation path is through a vibrationally excited state , to which molecules can be pumped by infrared radiation @xcite .",
    "this excitation is possible because a round trip of radiative transitions between the vibrational ground and excited states can change the rotational level j by 2 .",
    "the first vibrationally excited state of hcn is its bending state ( = 1 ) 1024 k above the ground ( fig .",
    "[ f.hcnlevels ] ) .",
    "radiative excitation of hcn through this state has been observed around dusty evolved and young high - mass stars @xcite . meanwhile , despite the increasing number of extragalactic hcn observations , it has been controversial whether such radiative excitation is significant in extragalactic observations where the volume probed is much larger and having enough ir flux there more difficult @xcite .",
    "it was found significant in a @xmath3  quasar @xcite but the quasar may be exceptional .    in this letter , we report our detection of rotational transitions from vibrationally excited hcn in the luminous infrared galaxy ngc 4418 .",

    "spectral resolution was 1.625 and 3.25 mhz for our 270 and 350 ghz runs , respectively .",
    "the system gain , passband , and flux scale were calibrated using a nearby quasar 3c273 ( which dimmed in may ) , quasars and planets , and mars ( @xmath8=190 k and @xmath9=192 k ) and titan ( @xmath8=77 k for continuum ) , respectively .",

    "we did not subtract continuum in order to later determine the continuum and lines in the spectra .",
    "there are two calibration notes .",
    "first , we took the spectral index of 3c273 into account in our gain calibration in order to accurately scale the flux of our two sidebands .",
    "we used the spectral index @xmath10 ( for @xmath11 ) , the mean of our march and may measurements .",
    "second , we verified our passband calibration by setting aside a fraction of 3c273 data when determining passband shapes and by applying the same calibration to the galaxy and the 3c273 data . the flatness of the resulting test 3c273 spectra confirmed our calibration .",
    "strong continuum and line emission were detected at the nucleus of ngc 4418 .",
    "no extended emission was detected off the nucleus except co(32 ) that was marginally resolved .",
    "any missing flux in our data is estimated to be less than our calibration error on the basis of the ratio of our flux to single - dish flux , @xmath12 for co(32 ) @xcite and @xmath13 for ( 43 ) ( aalto et al . in prep . )    our spectra and emission parameters in the central kpc are presented in fig .",

    "we obtained the following hcn excitation temperatures among ( , j)=(@xmath19,4 ) , ( @xmath19,3 ) , and ( 0,4 ) states under the assumptions described below : ( @xmath19,4 ; @xmath19,3)=31@xmath2013 k , ( @xmath19,4 ; 0,4)=227@xmath2018 k , and ( @xmath19,3 ; 0,4)=254@xmath2024 k. the first one is a rotational excitation temperature   and the second is a vibrational excitation temperature .",
    "we needed opacity correction to the hcn(43 ) flux for these excitation temperatures because the line is almost certainly saturated considering its low flux ratio , 3 , to ( 43 ) .",
    "we adopted 3000@xmath201000 jy  as the opacity - corrected hcn(43 ) flux on the basis of ( 43 ) and ( 43 ) fluxes and the abundance ratios [ /]@xmath2150 and [ /]@xmath21300 ( * ? ? ?",

    "we also assumed that the vibrationally excited lines are optically thin , because if they were thick they would be as bright as the = 0 lines .",
    "another assumption here and in the  calculation above is that all hcn lines arise from the same volume .",
    "the vibrational excitation is most likely due to infrared radiation rather than collision for our  and .",
    "this is because collisional excitation would make   at = 1 equal to .",
    "if the excitation were due to  collision at 200 k the gas needs to be at or above the critical density for hcn = 1 , which is @xmath22   @xcite .",
    "radiative excitation is energetically possible .",
    "each rotational state j at the vibrational ground level has associated infrared absorption lines in the p , q , and r branches .",
    "the absorption lines supply energy to the hcn(j , j1 ) emission line , and weaker rotational lines at = 1 , in the limit of radiation - dominated excitation .",

    "parameters for our case are @xmath25=14 , @xmath29=2.34 jy and @xmath30 @xcite , and @xmath28=850  and @xmath31 1 jy for j=4 . the condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq.energy ] ) is satisfied with a wide margin ; the excess energy heats gas through collision . in this radiative excitation , the observed  indicates that the brightness temperature of the excitation source seen from the gas must be @xmath32 200 k at 14 .",
    "the vibrational excitation significantly affects rotational excitation in the vibrational ground level .",
    "we see this in a model with two vibrational levels , @xmath33=0 and 1 , whose energy gap is @xmath34 in temperature .",
    "each vibrational level has rotational sub - levels labeled with j. for a molecule at ( @xmath33,j)=(0,j ) there exist approximately @xmath35 molecules at @xmath33=1 that will spontaneously decay to the ( 0,j ) state .",
    "thus the rate of spontaneous transition to ( 0,j ) from @xmath33=1 is @xmath36 , and radiative excitation of the j level at @xmath33=0 through @xmath33=1 needs @xmath37 where  and  are the einstein @xmath38 coefficients for the vibrational and rotational transitions , respectively .",
    "this is equivalent to equation ( 6 ) of @xcite but is more useful when  is available .",
    "similarly , the radiative excitation through @xmath33=1 exceeds collisional ( de)excitation among @xmath33=0 rotational levels when @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number density of the main collision partner and @xmath41 is the collisional rate coefficient .",
    "in other words , radiative pumping to @xmath33=1 is equivalent to a gas density @xmath42 in terms of the rotational excitation around j at @xmath33=0 .",
    "parameters for hcn are @xmath34=1024 k and @xmath43=3.7   for the bending mode @xcite and @xmath44   for hcn  collisions at j@xmath4510 and gas kinetic temperatures 30300 k @xcite . for the observed  of 227 k ,",

    "the ir - pumping through = 1 matches @xmath47  for our   according to eq .",
    "( [ eq.equivncol ] ) , although this is somewhat overestimated because collisional transitions are not limited to @xmath48 and half of the vibrational transitions are in the q branch where @xmath49 .",
    "the relatively low rotational temperature ( @xmath1=@xmath19 ; j4)=31@xmath2013 k probably suggests that the system is not in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "a caution here is that  may be higher and even comparable to  depending on the uncertain 355 ghz continuum mentioned in  [ s.results ] ;  would be @xmath50 k if we adopt the lower continuum level estimated from the lsb .",
    "a possible reason for the lower rotational temperature than  is that rotational excitation at low j ( @xmath51 ) is strongly affected by collision and ( sub)millimeter radiation ; note that hcn(43 ) is optically thick .",
    "the  at = 1 may be relatively low accordingly .",
    "rotational temperature can be higher in higher j since collisional excitation in @xmath52100 k gas gives way there to ir - pumping as the main excitation mechanism .",
    "this may explain the hcn ( rotational ) temperature of 300 k ( @xmath53% ) that @xcite estimated from the q - branch absorption profile under lte assumption , because high j population broadens the profile .    for comparison , we analyzed the @xmath54 hcn lines alone using the large - velocity - gradient model via radex @xcite and found two types of solutions .",
    "we used for this the abundance ratios mentioned above and hcn(10 ) data from @xcite .",
    "one solution has thermalized hcn at j=4 , @xmath55 , @xmath2140 k , and  @xmath56 .",
    "another has subthermal excitation at j=4 , moderate opacity of , and such parameters as @xmath57 , @xmath32 30 k , and  @xmath58 .",
    "these temperatures are consistent with our  at = 1 and the high column densities are in accord with the deep obscuration toward the nucleus .",
    "however , these solutions can not explain the observed hcn = 1 lines .    to summarize ,",
    "the vibrationally excited hcn is most likely ir pumped , and the observed degree of vibrational excitation suggests strong influence of the excitation path through = 1 to the rotational excitation in the ground state although it may not dominate low - j excitation .",
    "properties of ( dense ) molecular gas in ngc 4418 can not be studied through hcn ignoring the ir - pumping . in further study",
    ", one needs to reexamine our simplistic assumptions that the emitting regions of = 0 and 1 lines are cospatial and have a single characteristic temperature and density . in reality",
    ", gas density must be diverse , and there must be low density gas where hcn is excited only under the ir - pumping .",
    "thus the total flux of any hcn @xmath33=0 line should be enhanced at least for that component .",
    "another improvement in modeling would be to include atomic hydrogen and electrons as collision partners @xcite .",
    "is detected in its vibrational ground and excited states though some transitions are marginal or blended with other lines .",
    "its population diagram in fig . [ f.n4418pop ] shows that the measured line fluxes are consistent with those of other transitions detected by @xcite .",
    "the diagram indicates overall excitation temperatures in the range of 100300 k , except for the @xmath59 k levels where @xcite estimated = 29 k for @xmath33=0 .",
    "they also obtained 500 k. these temperatures are compatible with our hcn excitation temperatures .",
    "the hcn to  ratio of the mean brightness temperatures is @xmath60 for j=43 and @xmath61 for j=32 on the assumption of the same emitting volume ; it is 1.9 for j=10 @xcite .",
    "brighter hcn than  in some seyfert galaxies and in this galaxy has been proposed to be a result of or evidence for chemistry driven by x - ray radiation from active nucleus @xcite although there have been different views ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is conceivable at least for objects as deeply embedded as the nucleus of ngc 4418 that the ir - pumping also affects this ratio .",
    "the minimum brightness temperature of the infrared source needed for the radiative pumping of j=1 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.mintvib ] ) as @xmath62 because vibrational temperature is at or below the source brightness temperature at the wavelength of the vibrational transition .",
    "this minimum temperature is 86 k at 14  for hcn and 156 , 115 , 107 , 80 , and 33 k at 4.6 , 7.8 , 12 , 15 , and 45   for co , cs , , , and , respectively ( * ? ? ?",
