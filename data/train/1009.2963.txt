    "an earlier review provides an overview on the application of coupled - cluster theory to various areas of physics @xcite . in atoms it is equivalent to incorporating electron correlation effects to all order .",

    "in this paper we report the development and results of relativistic coupled - cluster atomic calculations for two - valence atoms . for this",
    "we employ the fock - space open - shell cct @xcite , which is also referred as valence universal . based on which the two - valence cc wave operators are calculated via the closed and one - valence wave operators .",
    "the necessary developments of these intermediate stages of calculations were reported in our previous works @xcite .",

    "@xcite we proposed a new scheme to calculate properties with cc wave functions to all order . in the present work we implement two - valence fock - space relativistic cct with an all particle valence space .",
    "a similar approach was adopted in a previous work on relativistic coupled - cluster calculations of two - valence systems @xcite .",
    "this is general enough for the precise wave function and properties calculations of the low - lying levels of two - valence systems like the alkaline - earth metal atoms , yb and hg . in these systems ,",
    "the low - lying levels arise from the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 configurations .",
    "we show selecting a model space consisting of these configurations is incomplete but quasi - complete .",

    "we apply the method we have developed to calculate the wave functions of alkaline - earth atoms sr and ba , and lanthanide atom yb .",
    "all of these atoms are candidates of extremely precise experiments either for application oriented investigations or to probe fundamental laws of nature",

    "there are also proposals to measure atomic electric dipole moment , a signature of parity and time violations , with novel techniques @xcite .",
    "it must be mentioned that several isotopes of yb has been cooled to degeneracy @xcite and could be employed in future precision measurements .",
    "further more , atomic yb in an optical lattice is a candidate of frequency standard @xcite .    as mentioned before , to obtain the two - valence wave operator , we compute the closed - shell and one - valence wave operators in the intermediate steps . we take advantage of this and use the one - valence wave operator to compute the hyper fine constants of sr@xmath0 , ba@xmath0 and yb@xmath0 .",
    "for the first two ions , we reported the magnetic hyperfine structure constants ( hfs ) in our previous paper @xcite , so we compute only the electric quadrupole hfs constants . whereas for yb@xmath0 we compute both the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hfs constants .",
    "in addition , we also compute the electric dipole transitions matrix elements . like the neutral atoms , all the ions are under experimental investigations for various precision measurements .",
    "for example , a single trapped @xmath5 is a suitable frequency standard @xcite .",
    "there are similar experiments with yb@xmath0 @xcite as an alternative frequency standard .",
    "and it is one of the frequency standards in the laboratory measurement of temporal variation of fine structure constant @xcite .",
    "these are application oriented precision experiments .",
    "the other fascinating prospect is the observation of parity nonconservation in a single @xmath6 @xcite .",

    "a model space is complete , if it consists of all the configurations formed by accommodating the valence electrons among the valence shells in all possible combinations .",
    "a remarkable consequence of choosing cms in fock - space coupled - cluster is that , the excitation operators @xmath36 are common to all the determinants in the model space .",
    "further more , @xmath36 uniquely separates into internal and external sectors .",
    "the external excitations contribute to @xmath76 and projects a model function to the complementary space .",
    "whereas , internal excitations connect one model function to another model function and occurs in the definition of @xmath37 . as we shall explore later , in the context of incomplete model space ( ims ) , such a neat separation is specific to cms and another class of model space referred as quasi complete @xcite .",
    "validity of linked cluster theorem , one basic condition for any legitimate many - body theory , is assured in cms .",
    "the cms , though endowed with several desirable properties , has one serious short coming for systems with two or more valence electrons .",
    "it inevitably encounters _ intruder _ states @xcite and the outcome is severe convergence problems .",
    "this is the manifestation of model states with high energies that lies within the energy domain of the orthogonal space . in other words , in cms when all possible configurations are considered , the model and complementary space are no longer energetically well separated .",
    "the occurrence of vanishing energy denominators is then a distinct possibility .",
    "indeed , we invariably encounter _ intruder _ states in all our two - valence calculations with cms .",
    "its presence is the rule rather than the exception .    for a better description of the cms and intruder states",
    "let us consider a specific example , the low - lying levels of yb atom .",
    "configurations and terms of the ground and first few excited states important in precision spectroscopy are @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are then the obvious choice of valence shells .",

    "indeed , we do encounter divergences which , on careful analysis , can be attributed to the intruder states .    in this work ,",
    "we proceed to the relativistic two - valence coupled - cluster theory via the closed - shell @xcite and one - valence coupled - cluster @xcite theories reported in our previous works .",
    "we implement this within the framework of fock - space or valence universal cct @xcite .",
    "the theory can be extended to systems with both particles and holes , however , for our present study an all particle implementation is sufficient .",
    "accordingly , the valence electrons are treated as particles @xcite and each sector  closed - shell , one- and two - valence  are separate hilbert spaces .",
    "technical advantage of fock - space cct with cms is the sector wise clean separation of cluster operators @xcite .",
    "however , the hilbert spaces of two - valence subsumes the one - valence after a direct product with a spectator valence state and similarly , the closed - shell after direct product with two - valence states .",
    "the state universal @xcite is another flavour of open - shell cct , where the wave operator is calculates in a single hilbert space consisting of all the valence electrons .",
    "the wave operator is then state dependent and there is a lack of generality in the cluster equations .",
    "further more , it requires complicated book keeping .",
    "these reasons have motivated us to choose the fock - space cct .",
    "detailed discussions on fock - space cct and subtle issues related to the choice of model spaces are given in the review of lindgren and mukherjee @xcite .",
    "coupled - cluster theory is a non - perturbative many - body theory .",
    "it is equivalent to selecting linked terms in the bloch equation , eq.([bloch_eq ] ) , to all orders and combining terms of same level of excitation ( loe ) . the elegance and perhaps , all the attendant difficulties of cct is the exponential nature of the wave operator .",
    "we provide a brief reprise of the closed - shell @xcite and one - valence cct @xcite , these form the initial steps of the two - valence coupled - cluster theory .",
