    "recently , the fcc has released the tvws for secondary access @xcite@xcite under a database - assisted architecture , where there are several geo - location databases providing spectrum availability of the tv channels .",
    "these databases will be managed by database operators ( dos ) approved by the fcc . to manage the operation costs , proper business models are essential for dos .",
    "the fcc allows dos to determine their own pricing schemes @xcite and there are two different ways in which sus can assess the tvws with the help of a database .",
    "sus can register their wsds in the database in a soft - licence style @xcite .",
    "part of the available tv spectrum is then reserved for the registered sus @xcite@xcite .",
    "unregistered sus can also access tvws in a purely secondary manner .",
    "for instance , an su can first connect to the database and upload wsd information such as location and transmission power and then obtain a list of available channels from the database .    as a result ,",
    "two different pricing schemes can be employed , one for registered and the other for unregistered sus , respectively .",
    "registered sus pay a registration fee to dos and access the reserved bandwidth exclusively .",
    "this pricing scheme can be referred to as the _ registration scheme_. unregistered sus query the database only when they are in need of tv spectrum .",
    "dos charge them according to the number of database queries they make .",
    "this pricing scheme is referred to as the _ service plan scheme_. the co - existence of multiple pricing channels allows dos to better manage their costs and provides different service qualities to different types of sus .",
    "for example , the registration scheme can be adopted by sus providing rural broadband or smart metering services , since the reserved bandwidth may suffer from less severe interference . on the other hand ,",
    "the service plan scheme suits the temporary utilization of tvws such as home networking .    to harvest the advantages of both pricing schemes and maximize the profit of dos , two challenges need to be addressed .",
    "first , how should dos determine pricing parameters for each scheme ?",
    "with limited available tv bandwidth , dos need to decide how much to allocate to each pricing channel .",
    "also , the registration fee in the registration scheme and the price for a certain amount of queries should be determined .",
    "second , how should sus choose between the two schemes ?",
    "both schemes have their pros and cons for different types of sus .",
    "the two challenges are coupled together .",
    "the decisions of sus on which pricing scheme to choose can affect the profit obtained by dos while the pricing parameters designed by dos ensure sus have different preferences for either scheme .    in this paper , we focus on do s hybrid pricing scheme design considering both the registration and the service plan scheme . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "there are no existing works on geo - location database considering a hybrid pricing model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we consider one do and multiple types of sus .",
    "the sus can strategically choose between the two pricing schemes . unlike many existing works consider no su strategies when there exist multiple pricing schemes , in this paper , we assume users can have their own choices other than being directly classified into either pricing scheme . we argue that especially for a new service like database - based networking , users will consider seriously of the benefits from each scheme and other players responses .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a two - stage pricing framework . at stage",
    "i , the do announces the amount of bandwidth to be reserved and the registration fee for the registered sus and then the sus choose whether to register or not . at stage ii ,",
    "the do announces a set of service plans for the unregistered sus to choose from .    for the sus ,",
    "they decide which pricing scheme to choose given the announced pricing schemes .",
    "if the service plan scheme is adopted , sus should further decide one particular plan to buy . in this paper , we consider two different su scenarios . in the non - strategic case ,",
    "sus have fixed their pricing scheme choices . in the strategic case ,",
    "sus can compete with each other in choosing either pricing schemes . in the later case",
    ", the competition among the sus is modeled with the non - cooperative game theory since the choices of the other sus can affect an su s utility owing to the sharing of tvws .    for the do , the problem is to optimally allocate bandwidth and design pricing parameters based on estimated actions of the sus .",
    "in this paper , we consider the do has either complete or incomplete information of the sus . by complete information ,",
    "we mean that the do knows the exact _ type _ of each su .",
    "the type of su relates with its channel quality , valuation for the spectrum et .",
    "al . in the case of incomplete information ,",
    "the do knows only a distribution of the types .",
    "we model the optimal service plan design problem with contract theory .",
    "different service plans are considered to be different contract items and an optimal contract is determined based on the knowledge of the su types . to optimally choose pricing parameters , one challenge to tackle",
    "is how the do estimate the possible actions of the sus , especially for the strategic case .",
    "there may be multiple possible equilibriums existed in the game .",
    "we solve this challenge by exploring the nature of our problem and propose computationally feasible algorithm to estimate the outcome of the game .",
    "the major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * we propose a hybrid pricing scheme for the do considering the heterogeneity of sus types .",
    "as far as we know , it is the first work considering hybrid pricing schemes for tvws database .",
    "* we model the competition among the strategic sus as a non - cooperative game .",
    "we prove the existence of the nash equilibrium ( ne ) under both the complete and incomplete information cases . by exploring the nature of the problem , we design computational feasible distributed algorithms for the sus to achieve an ne with bounded iterations .",
    "* we propose algorithms for the do to optimally decide pricing parameters .",
    "we formulate the service plan design with contract theory and derive optimal contract items under the complete information and sub - optimal items for and incomplete information scenario .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we describe the pricing framework and detailed system model . problem formulation is presented in section [ sec : formulation ] . in section",
    "[ sec : non - strategic_complete ] we study the optimal pricing solution for non - strategic sus under the complete information scenario as a baseline case .",
    "then in section [ sec : strategic_complete ] and section [ sec : strategic_incomplete ] , we consider the sus to be strategic players , under complete and incomplete information scenario , respectively .",
    "numerical results are given in section [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "related works are further reviewed in section [ sec : related_works ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this section , after an overview of the system parameters , we introduce the big picture of the proposed pricing framework",
    ". then we further detail the model for the do and the sus , respectively .",
    "key notations are summarized in table [ tab : notations ] .",
    "we consider the scenario with one do and @xmath0 sus denoted as @xmath1 .",
    "we assume @xmath0 is public information available to the do and the sus .",
    "for the ease of analysis , we assume all the sus are in the same contention domain @xcite . fcc requires the sus to periodically access the database @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider a time duration of @xmath2 periods . in each period , before accessing the tv channels , the sus should connect to the database to obtain a list of available channels .",
    "we assume the total available tv channels in each period have an expected bandwidth of @xmath3 and the bandwidth of a channel is @xmath4 .",
    "the number of available channels is then @xmath5 .",
    ".key notations in this paper .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     when applying a two - dimensional search , we need to fix the range of @xmath6 . recall that @xmath6 is the money paid by the registered sus to the do .",
    "when @xmath7 , the highest revenue a su can obtain is @xmath8 .",
    "so @xmath6 should be within @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "we assume the smallest change in @xmath6 is @xmath10 unit .",
    "we assume the total tv bandwidth can only be allocated in the unit of @xmath11 mhz ( the same as the spectrum span of a tv channel in the us ) .",
    "so the possible values of @xmath12 are @xmath13 .    for the database maintenance cost we set @xmath14 in @xmath15 and we vary the parameter @xmath16 in the range @xmath17 $ ] . if @xmath16 is too high , do will not have the incentive to consider the registration scheme .",
    "since the marginal cost of one database access is very small compared with the bandwidth reservation cost , we set the default value of @xmath18 to be 0 .    in the case of non - strategic sus , we assume @xmath19s are the same among all types .",
    "we use a single value @xmath20 to denote the fraction of sus preferring the registration scheme .",
    "we will set @xmath20 to be either @xmath21 or @xmath22 in our simulations .",
    "in this section , for convenience we refer to the complete information scenario as _",
    "cis _ and the incomplete information scenario as _",
    "iis_.        in this section ,",
    "we compare the two cases : non - strategic sus in cis and strategic sus in cis to show the impact of su strategy on the pricing solution .",
    "first , in fig . [ fig : epsilon0-b_r_non - strategic ] , we fixed the su type distribution to be distr .",
    "1 . we set @xmath18 to be either 0.05 or 0.1 .",
    "we then vary the reservation cost @xmath16 and plot the optimal @xmath12 obtained from three cases : non - strategic sus with @xmath23 , non - strategic sus with @xmath24 and strategic sus , all under cis . from fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon0-b_r_non - strategic ] , we can see that with non - strategic sus , the do tends to reserve less bandwidth for the reservation scheme under the same @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "that is because when the sus are non - strategic players , they decide whether to pay the registration fee only based on the prior knowledge of the number of sus in the registration scheme which is predetermined .",
    "therefore , many sus will overestimate the registration fee , so that the do can not increase the registration fee to obtain higher profit . as a result ,",
    "the do prefers the service plan scheme and reserves less bandwidth .",
    "second , in fig .",
    "[ fig : strategic_vs_non - strategic ] , we fixed the su type distribution to be distr . 1 and set @xmath18 to be 0.05 .",
    "we vary the reservation cost @xmath16 and plot the utility of do and the average utility of sus given the optimal pricing parameters . from fig .",
    "[ fig : strategic_vs_non - strategic_udo ] , we can see that in both scenarios , the do utility first decreases and then remains the same after @xmath25 . when @xmath16 is higher , the do utility in the non - strategic scenario is higher compared with that in the strategic su scenario . that s because when @xmath16 is higher , in the strategic scenario , the profit do makes from the registered sus become smaller however , most of do profit in the non - strategic su scenario comes from the non - registered sus .",
    "we can also see from fig .",
    "[ fig : strategic_vs_non - strategic_usu ] that when sus are strategically player , their average utility are still non - zero when @xmath26",
    ". that is because , in the non - strategic su scenario , when @xmath26 , @xmath25 , all sus can only get zero utility .",
    "however , in the strategic su scenario , some sus can choose the registered scheme to obtain non - zero utility .",
    "from the comparison , we can conclude that with more intelligent su strategy , sus achieve higher average utility .      we compared the do s revenue when applying hybrid and uniform pricing schemes .",
    "there are two uniform pricing schemes : registration only or service plan only .",
    "we set @xmath27 . in the case of registration scheme only , @xmath28 while in the case of service plan scheme only , @xmath25 .",
    "we show the maximum possible revenues the do can obtain in type distributions 1 - 3 and random distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : hybrid ] .",
    "the results from random distribution is an average of 100 runs .",
    "we can see that the hybrid pricing scheme provides higher revenue for the do . by offering hybrid pricing schemes ,",
    "the do has a new degree of freedom to tune the bandwidth segmentation to increase its profit .",
    "we will evaluate the impact of @xmath29 in the next evaluation .",
    "to show the impact of the bandwidth reservation cost on the optimal bandwidth reservation @xmath12 , we vary @xmath16 from 0 to 5.2 and plot the optimal @xmath12 under each @xmath16 in both cis and iis in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon0-b_r_scenario0 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon0-b_r_scenario1 ] , respectively . in both information scenarios ,",
    "@xmath12 decreases with the increase of @xmath16 . that is because with greater @xmath16",
    ", the reservation cost for the same bandwidth is higher , so the do prefers to allocate more bandwidth for unregistered users .",
    "we can see that when @xmath30 , @xmath25 for all cases , which means no bandwidth is reserved for the registration scheme .",
    "we can also observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon0-b_r ] that in distr . 2 @xmath12 decreases the fastest among the three distributions .",
    "that is because in distr .",
    "2 , there are more sus of higher types , who are more likely to have @xmath31 in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : max_udo3 ] ) , thus do can benefit more from the service plan scheme .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the cis , @xmath12 decreases to zero sooner compared with that in the iis .",
    "that is because in cis , do can design the query plans for individual unregistered sus to make more profit .          in fig .",
    "[ fig : information ] , we show the impact of the do s knowledge of the sus personal information on the utility of the do and the sus . the sus types are set to distribution 1 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : information_udo ] that the do has higher utility in the cis than that in the iis , when @xmath32 .",
    "that is because when @xmath32 , @xmath33 in cis . as a result ,",
    "the bandwidth for the service plan scheme is non - zero and the do can make more revenue from unregistered sus in the cis .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : information_usu ] that the sus have higher average utility in the iis than that in cis , when @xmath34 .",
    "that because when @xmath34 , @xmath33 in iis . as a result",
    ", the bandwidth for the service plan scheme is non - zero and the sus can get non - negative utility when choosing the service plan scheme .",
    "we can also notice that when @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ fig : information_udo ] and when @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ fig : information_usu ] , @xmath28 , which means all bandwidth is reserved for registered sus . as the do design registration scheme to admit only registered sus with the highest type , the utilities obtain in both information scenario are the same .    in summary , with more knowledge of the sus information ,",
    "the do enjoys higher utility . on the other hand",
    ", the hidden information provides the sus higher utility .      to show the impact of the sus type distribution on the contract design",
    ", we fixed @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and compute the @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the service plans for 50 unregistered sus in the 5 different su type distributions .",
    "note that the parameters may not be the optimal pricing parameters for each distribution , the use of the same parameters for all the distributions allows us to see the impact of su type distribution separately .",
    "[ fig : contract ] shows the results for @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : contract_query ] , we can see that when the number of sus of lower types is higher , ( compared distr . 3 and distr .",
    "1 ) , do tends to assign non - zero queries for lower type sus .",
    "that is because a query @xmath40 is determined by a factor of @xmath42 in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : max_udo3 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : contract_price ] we can see that if non - zero @xmath40 is assigned to a lower type , a lower price @xmath41 should be charged .",
    "this is because , the price should follow the individual rationality constraint ( eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : ir ] ) ) for such sus .",
    "we implemented the brunching and ironing algorithm @xcite for the contract design .",
    "we assume at stage i , the do and the sus still use algorithm [ alg : valid_q ] to estimate the contracts to ensure the existence of an ne .",
    "we generate random su type distributions with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and set @xmath25 , which indicates that all the @xmath0 sus choose the service plan scheme .",
    "we repeated the test for 100 times .",
    "we show the average utility of the do obtained from query assignment algorithms in fig .",
    "[ fig : suboptimal ] . for a different @xmath45 , algorithm",
    "[ alg : valid_q ] achieves the do utility within 90% of that obtained from the optimal algorithm .      to check the convergence time to ne via algorithm",
    "[ alg : registration_incomplete_info ] , we fix @xmath37 , @xmath38 and generate @xmath46 sus with uniformly distributed types . under each @xmath0",
    ", we repeat algorithm [ alg : registration_incomplete_info ] 200 times . fig . [",
    "fig : convergence ] shows the average steps of improvement needed to achieve an ne .",
    "it is clear that the number of steps is bounded by @xmath47 , which verifies theorem [ thm : ndrg_property2 ] .",
    "we may prove a tighter bound for the convergence time in our future work .",
    "in this paper , to make the problem solvable , we have made several simplifications in the system model .",
    "there are several interesting ways to further extend this work .",
    "first , the registration scheme considered in this paper admits a uniform registration fee . in a more flexible setting ,",
    "the registered sus can pay different amounts of registration fees and enjoy different shares of the reserved bandwidth . similarly with the query plan scheme ,",
    "the do can offer several levels of registration fees .",
    "second , the pricing framework considered in this paper is not dynamic .",
    "the pricing parameters are determined at the beginning once and will not change . in a more dynamic setting ,",
    "the do can redesign new pricing parameters for the following time durations and the sus can also re - select the pricing scheme given the observation in previous time durations and the newly announced pricing parameter . in this case , the interactions between the do and the sus become a repeated game . also , the sus may dynamically join and leave the query plan .",
    "therefore , the sus should consider the expectation of future su behaviors when choosing their pricing schemes .",
    "most existing works on geo - location databases can be classified into two categories .",
    "some works focus on the design of geo - location database to protect primary users . in @xcite ,",
    "gurney et al . discussed the methods to calculate the protection area for tv stations . in @xcite , murty",
    "et al . designed a database - driven white space network based on measurement studies and terrain data .",
    "some other works focused on the networking issue with the assumption that the database is already set up . in @xcite ,",
    "feng et al .",
    "presented a white space system utilizing a database . in @xcite , chen et al .",
    "considered the channel selection and access point association problem .",
    "one recent work @xcite also address the business model related to the geo - location database . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed that the geo - location database acts as a spectrum broker reserving the spectrum from spectrum licensees .",
    "they considered only one pricing scheme which is similar to the registration scheme discussed in our paper . compared to our previous work @xcite , in this paper",
    ", we further extend the scenario to non - strategic sus and compared the pricing schemes with non - strategic and strategic sus under complete information scenario .",
    "we also extend our theoretical analysis and numerical evaluations .",
    "many works also focus on the economic issue of dynamic spectrum sharing . in @xcite ,",
    "the pricing - based spectrum access control is investigated under secondary users competitions . in @xcite , spectrum pricing with spatial reuse",
    "is considered .",
    "contract theory is utilized in the scenarios where the spectrum buyers have hidden information . in @xcite , gao et al .",
    "leveraged contract theory to analyze the spectrum trading between primary operator and sus . in @xcite ,",
    "contract theory is applied to the cooperative communication scenario . in this paper",
    ", we also model the service plan design with contract theory .",
    "however , due to the co - existence of hybrid pricing schemes , there is uncertainty about the number of sus choosing the contract items , which is different from existing works .",
    "there are some works focus on the hybrid pricing of other limited resources . in @xcite .",
    "wang et.al study the problem of capacity segmentation for two different pricing schemes for cloud service providers .",
    "one key difference between our work and @xcite is that the strategic sus considered in our paper can dynamically choose between pricing schemes .",
    "while in @xcite , the users are pre - categorized into different pricing scheme before designing the pricing schemes .",
    "in this paper , we consider a hybrid pricing model for tvws database .",
    "the sus can choose between the registration and the service plan scheme .",
    "we investigate scenarios where the sus can be either non - strategic or strategic players and the do has either complete and incomplete information of the sus . in the non - strategic su scenario , we model the competitions among the sus as non - cooperative game and prove the existence of an ne in two different scenarios by showing that the game is an unweighted congestion game .",
    "we model the pricing for unregistered sus with contract theory and derive suboptimal query plans for different types of sus .",
    "based on the sus pricing scheme choices , the do optimally determines the bandwidth segmentation and pricing parameters to maximize its profit .",
    "we have conducted extensive simulations to obtain numerical results and verify our theoretical claims .",
