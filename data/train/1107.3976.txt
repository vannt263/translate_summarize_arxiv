    "although the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is able to explain the experimental results obtained so far @xcite , its problems and open questions shed some doubt on its prospects as being the ultimate theory of fundamental particles and their interactions .",
    "the large number of free parameters in the model , the nature of the elementary particles , the reason for their observed mass hierarchy , the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism are some examples of these open issues .",
    "a number of alternative theories have been proposed as the cure to these problems .",
    "for example , grand unified models @xcite , technicolour @xcite , compositeness @xcite and supersymmetry @xcite can be cited .",
    "the composite models are particularly interesting for the continued simplification they offer .",
    "similar situations have been seen at least twice in the the past : the big and complex periodic table of elements has been understood in terms of three constituents and their combinations : the proton , the neutron and the electron .",
    "similarly , to solve the hadron inflation of the 1960ies , the quark model had to be introduced .",
    "the hope of the authors is to propose a solution to some of the aforementioned problems with an effective model at the preonic level . considering elementary particle family replication and especially the fermion mixings as hints for preonic structure of some of sm particles ,",
    "a number of preonic models , with different levels of compositeness , have been studied by various groups .",
    "below we list a few examples .",
    "h. harari @xcite and a. m. shupe @xcite proposed two coloured fermionic preons ( t , v ) with which the first generation of sm quarks and leptons can be formulated as three preon bound states . in this model , the other fermion generations",
    "are thought to be excitations of the first generation and the sm bosons are assumed to be fundamental particles .",
    "considering harari - shupe model , buchmann and schmid @xcite later proposed some quark - like structures with hypercolours so that the model become compatible with t hooft anomaly .",
    "h. fritzsch and g. mandelbaum considered two fermionic and two bosonic preons ( @xmath1 ) to construct all sm fundamental particles except the photon and gluons @xcite . in this model , the first generation of sm quarks and leptons are composed of a fermionic and a bosonic preon , while @xmath2 , @xmath3 and higgs bosons are assumed to consist of a fermionic preon and its anti - particle .",
    "the other generations are constructed by adding one or more `` gluons '' of the preon binding force ( haplodynamics ) to the appropriate state .",
    "therefore , this model is not able to give any constraint on the number of the generations in the sm .",
    "j. dugne , s. fredriksson , j. hansson and e. predazzi , in their preon trinity model @xcite , proposed three coloured fermionic preons ( @xmath4 ) with which they construct three scalar bound states ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "with the bound state of a fermionic and a scalar preon ( or its anti - particle ) they construct all sm fermions and more : one additional charged lepton , two neutral leptons and three additional quarks emerge naturally from the model . with the various combinations of the fermionic preons ,",
    "they construct the electroweak gauge bosons and more : the model predicts two additional charged bosons and four additional neutral ones .",
    "a. celikel , m. kantar and s. sultansoy @xcite proposed two scalar and two fermionic preons , all coloured . in this",
    "model leptons are bound states of one fermionic preon and one scalar antipreon whereas antiquarks consist of one fermionic and one scalar preon . as a result",
    "each sm lepton has its colour octet partner and each sm antiquark has its colour sextet partner .",
    "s. ishida and sekiguchi @xcite have discussed a left - right symmetric preon model assuming the quarks , leptons and weak bosons as composite states and the weak interaction is a secondary effective one without the need of breaking a fundamental symmetry .",
    "the fermions are formed by a fermionic and a bosonic preons where the fermionic preons are colour singlet but isospin doublet and bosonic preons are @xmath6 colour . the conservation of baryon and lepton number is included by hand .",
    "the goal of this work is to use the key concepts from compositeness and supersymmetry ideas for constructing a new model with charge - colour and spin symmetry at preonic level . using this preonic model , we attempt to reduce the number of free parameters ,",
    "answer the questions on the number of elementary particle families , to propose a candidate for the dark matter ( dm ) and to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "it will be shown that all three fermion generations of the sm can be obtained from a single chiral coloured preon using appropriate symmetries . using current - current interactions , the known bosons of the sm naturally emerge in the right form , e.g. gluon masses vanishingly small .",
    "the baryon and lepton number conservations are emergent from the model itself , prohibiting the anomalies like the proton decay .",
    "the rest of this manuscript is organized as follows : in the next section , the reader will be motivated for a colour and spin symmetric preonic model , musy model , which defines all known sm fundamental particles as preonic bound states .",
    "the section [ sec : dynamics - of - musy ] will go into the dynamics of the musy model to define the musy algebra and to construct the effective musy lagrangian . in section [ sec : smparticles ] , the preonic bound states forming sm particles aer discussed . section [ sec : fenomenoloji ] contains a musy description of the well known processes of proton and @xmath0-decay followed by an assesment of the ckm and mns mixings in musy model . in section [ sec : predictions - of - musy ] , a number of testable musy predictions are considered : excited fermions and dark matter candidates . the last section contains some discussions on the phenomenology of the musy model .",
    "the construction of the model starts with a single fermionic chiral preon colour triplet of charge @xmath7 .",
    "firstly , we define a conserved `` mu '' number for each preon as follows : @xmath8 where q is electrical charge , c is number of colours ( 3 for colour , -3 for anticolour triplet , 1 for colour singlet ) , s is spin and h is helicity ( @xmath9 for right , @xmath10 for left components ) .",
    "the conserved quantity mu will arise from a transformation which makes the action invariant , i.e. , a mu symmetry or musy in short .",
    ".preons of the musy model : musions .",
    "the subscript @xmath11 runs from 1 to 3 and @xmath12 runs for three colour charges ( red , green and blue ) .",
    "[ tab : musy - preons ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     possible bound states other than sm particles are in the form given in table [ tab : oghuz ] with their charge , colour and spin properties .",
    "these bound states are split into two subgroups which do not interact with each other : a group of bicoloured bosonic ( vector or scalar ) particles and another group of fermionic particles with 3/2 spin . a suitable name",
    "these new particles could be `` oghuz '' , and the two sub - groups could be called as `` bozoklar '' and `` oklar '' respectively .",
    "the bozoklar interact within the group via four point interactions consist of either fermionic preons and bosonic anti - preons or fermionic anti - preons and bosonic preons",
    ". therefore these `` particles '' can not interact with any of the sm bosons which consist of either all preons or all anti - preons and can be though as the dark matter ( dm ) candidates of the musy model .",
    "additionally , these dm candidates form a group of particles with two fermionic preons and another group with either one or three fermionic preons .",
    "a new symmetry , mu symmetry , including spin , colour and charge was introduced .",
    "it was shown that the mu symmetry is a generalization of the well known supersymmetry concept and in fact , reduces to susy in a specific scenario . using mu symmetry , and starting from a single chiral colour triplet preon",
    ", the electroweak and qcd was built .",
    "the musy model proposes sm fermions and gauge bosons as the bound states of scalar and fermionic preons .",
    "it also predicts the number of families as three , relating it to the number of colours in strong interactions .",
    "other naturally occurring features of the model are the inclusion of the lepton and baryon number conservation , the existence of the quark mixings and new fermions which do not interact with the sm fermions .",
    "these new fermions , named the oghuz , could be the dark matter candidates .",
    "the higher excitations of the sm bound states , are also expected to be present in nature and are to be sought at the present and future colliders .    with an effective lagrangian",
    "the musy model proposes the gauge bosons of the sm as current - current interactions .",
    "it is also contains vanishingly small gluon and photon masses due to infinitely strong four - point interaction of the fermionic preons .",
    "the electroweak sector remains very similar to the sm , including the weak mixing angle , arising from four - point scalar preon interactions .",
    "although the effective lagrangian approach does provide a working model , it would have been more elegant to embed all preonic states in a large enough gauge group similar to gut models , i.e. , a gauge interaction between preons an extension of musy model .",
    "the applicability of this idea is yet to be investigated .",
