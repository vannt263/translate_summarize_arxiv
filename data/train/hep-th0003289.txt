    "recently there has been a considerable effort in studying the ads / cft duality @xcite when conformal invariance is broken ( see @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "the general philosophy is that conformal invariance can be broken by considering a non - conformal vacuum of the conformal theory , or otherwise by considering a deformation of its lagrangian . in both cases",
    "the dual gravitational background will have an ads boundary but it will differ from this space in the inside . identifying the radial coordinate with the field theory energy scale",
    "the geometry will describe the rg flow starting from the uv conformal theory at the ads boundary .    in this note we shall consider the case of a non - conformal vacuum of @xmath1 @xmath0 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory .",
    "the moduli space of this theory is given by @xmath4 , parameterizing the relative position of @xmath5 identical d3-branes in the transverse space @xmath6 .",
    "separating the d3-branes in two stacks of @xmath7 and @xmath8 branes by a distance @xmath9 is equivalent to higgs the theory by giving an expectation value to the scalar fields according to = ( i_1 & 0 + 0 & -i_2 )  , [ higgs ] where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 unit matrix .",
    "the gauge symmetry is broken to @xmath2 and the theory is left with 16 conserved supercharges because conformal symmetry is broken .",
    "the symmetry breaking process gives rise to massive w particles with mass @xmath12 .",
    "this construction provides an example of maximally supersymmetric rg flow : starting from the uv @xmath1 conformal theory we flow to the ir conformal fixed points with @xmath3 gauge symmetry .",
    "related aspects of the ads / cft duality can be found in references [ 5 - 23 ] .    to derive the dual gravitational background we start with the double - centered d3-brane geometry with metric ds^2=h^-1/2ds^2(^4)+h^1/2ds^2(^6 )  , [ d3-metric ] where the harmonic function @xmath13 reads h=1 + +  , [ harmf ] with @xmath14 and @xmath15 the coordinates in the transverse space @xmath6 .",
    "next , we take the decoupling limit of @xcite which corresponds to drop the factor 1 in the harmonic function @xmath13 and to consider energy scales in the brane theory much smaller than the string scale , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "we further require the string coupling @xmath17 to be small and @xmath18 to be large for the supergravity approximation to hold .    in a recent paper @xcite we studied the classical absorption for a minimally coupled scalar , e.g. the dilaton field , in the double - centered d3-brane geometry .",
    "the analysis was valid for low energies such that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the gravity mass gap . in the above decoupling limit",
    "the cross - section for absorption by the @xmath21-th hole was seen to be _",
    "i=  ,  ( ji )  .",
    "[ csection ] in the field theory side , the total absorption cross section ( i.e. @xmath22 ) for a scalar field @xmath23 is related to the two - point function of the field theory dual operator @xmath24 ( x)=_^(x ) o_(0 )  , [ 2pf ] calculated in the non - conformal vacuum described above . in the case of the dilaton field",
    "the exact relation is @xcite = .disc^ ( s)|_p^0 = =  , [ disc ] where @xmath25 is the gravitational coupling , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the fourier transform of @xmath28 .",
    "the low energy expansion of the classical cross section ( [ csection ] ) corresponds to consider the dual field theory near the @xmath3 ir fixed point .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to determine the exact form of the effective action near the ir fixed points that results from integrating out the w particles and therefore to reproduce exactly the logarithmic correction to the cross section using the dual field theory .",
    "we shall see that the effective action is given by a deformation of the @xmath0 sym theory by a non - renormalized , irrelevant , dimension 8 operator as anticipated in @xcite .",
    "then , the correction to the cross section will be related to a three - point function of chiral primary operators calculated at the ir fixed points @xcite . to obtain exact agreement with the classical cross section calculation it was essential to use the symmetrized trace of the yang mills fields in the deformed lagrangian and to keep only the planar diagrams .",
    "this result is further evidence for a non - renormalization theorem for three - point functions of chiral primary operators [ 27 - 32 ] and provides a test of the ads / cft duality on the coulomb branch .",
    "we start by writing the lagrangian for the bosonic sector of @xmath0 @xmath1 sym theory in the following form _ 0=-  , [ lagrangian ] where @xmath29 are ten - dimensional indices and @xmath30 is short for @xmath31 , @xmath32 with @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "we removed the gauge coupling from the front of the action by rescaling the fields as @xmath35 , which also rescales the expectation value for the scalars in equation ( [ higgs ] ) .",
    "we want to integrate the w s in order to obtain an effective action for the light @xmath36 and @xmath37 coloured fields at energy scales @xmath38 as explained in @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the probe calculations extensively considered in the literature [ 33 - 36 ] , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the latter case",
    "the first non - vanishing one - loop diagram involves 4 @xmath1 coloured legs , with the following contribution to the effective bosonic lagrangian @xcite _",
    "[ 1loop ] notice that we are using the symmetrized trace as argued in @xcite .",
    "this fact will be essential to obtain agreement with the dual classical calculation of the absorption cross - section . also , these @xmath41 terms are protected @xcite , i.e. they are not renormalized by higher loop diagrams and therefore comparison with the strongly coupled supergravity regime is allowed .",
    "now we generalize the above result to arbitrary large @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the only difference is that the term in the effective action involving 4 @xmath3 fields will be multiplied by a factor @xmath42 @xmath43 because we have a @xmath44 colour index to sum over around the loop ( due to the w s exchange ) .",
    "also , for large @xmath5 graphs with both @xmath36 and @xmath37 coloured external legs are subleading since they are associated with non - planar graphs . hence , in the ir and for large @xmath5 there are no terms in the effective action of the type @xmath45 , where the subscript in @xmath46 means that the trace is over @xmath3 fields .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath41 terms in the effective action for the ir @xmath3 theory read _",
    "1=- n_jstr_i  ,  ( ji )  . [ effaction ]    to check this result consider the action for a probe of @xmath47 d3-branes in the ads near - horizon geometry of @xmath42 d3-branes , i.e. we assume that @xmath48",
    ". the probe dynamics is determined by the non - abelian dbi action @xcite which describes the effect of integrating all the massive strings stretching between the probe and the branes .",
    "the ads background is described by the metric ( [ d3-metric ] ) with the harmonic function @xmath49 .",
    "if the center of mass for the @xmath47 probes is placed at @xmath50 we have s_probe =- t_3d^4x f^-1 str_i  , [ probe ] where @xmath51 is the d3-brane tension .",
    "next we give an expectation value to the scalars @xmath52 , which means that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the center of mass fluctuating field in the radial direction . for large @xmath47 we can discard the fields in the center of the gauge group and consider only @xmath3 fields .",
    "thus , setting @xmath55 , expanding the dbi action and rescaling the fields according to @xmath56 we obtain the probe lagrangian _",
    "probe= -_i-_i  , [ probe1 ] which is in agreement with the previous result as expected from the non - renormalization of the @xmath41 terms .    in the context of the asymptotically flat d3-brane geometry ,",
    "the form of the above deformation of the sym lagrangian was conjectured based on the dbi corrections to the sym theory @xcite , or alternatively on the basis of @xmath57 representation theory @xcite . for a geometry with harmonic function h",
    "= h+()^4  , [ harmonic ] the dual field theory was conjectured to be @xcite = l_0-_8  , [ duallagr ] where @xmath58 is an irrelevant , dimension 8 operator .",
    "this deformation is irrelevant in the ir which agrees with the fact that for @xmath59 the constant @xmath60 becomes irrelevant in the harmonic function @xmath13 .",
    "what remains an open question is if the lagrangian ( [ duallagr ] ) describes the dual gravity theory as we flow from the ir .",
    "if we assume that the dbi action is dual to the full d3-brane geometry @xmath61 , then we can regard ( [ duallagr ] ) as the first correction to the sym theory and determine @xmath58 to be exactly @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "however , even in this case agreement between the gravity and the field theory calculations of the cross section is not found @xcite .",
    "fortunately the case here studied is entirely under control . while in the asymptotic flat space case",
    "the dbi action arises from integrating the massive string states that are dropped out in the decoupling limit , in our case the deformation of the ir lagrangian arises from integrating the w s that do survive the decoupling limit .",
    "in fact , in the decoupling limit of the double - centered d3-brane geometry the harmonic function @xmath13 is given down the @xmath21-th throat by h=()^4+()^4  .",
    "[ harmonic2 ] then the deformation of the sym action in the ir @xmath3 conformal fixed point is indeed given by ( [ duallagr ] ) with @xmath63 and @xmath64 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this ( non - renormalized ) deformation was computed exactly as a result of integrating the w s .",
    "hence , if we believe the ads / cft correspondence to hold on the coulomb branch , the gravity and perturbative field theory calculation of protected quantities in the ir using the lagrangian ( [ duallagr ] ) must give exactly the same answer .",
    "we proceed by calculating the cross section for absorption of the dilaton field using the field theory approach .",
    "this calculation was done in @xcite using a @xmath65 model .",
    "we refer the reader to that reference for the details and will present here only the relevant steps necessary to obtain the correct answer . for world - volume on - shell processes that involve the coupling of the dilaton to the brane",
    "only the gauge field is relevant . in the ir @xmath3 theory",
    "the operator @xmath24 dual to the dilaton field reads s_int&= &  , + & &  .",
    "[ inter ] then the two - point function for the operator @xmath24 is ( x)&= & = a _",
    "e^-d^4z o_(x)o_(0 ) + & = & + & = & + & & _",
    "0(x)+_1(x )  , [ 2ptf ] where we are just keeping the leading terms that will give the logarithmic corrections in the classical gravity result for the cross section .",
    "we see that the correction to the two - point function is related to a three - point function of chiral primary operators calculated at a ir conformal fixed point .",
    "we start by writing the euclidean space propagator for the field strength @xmath66 in the conformal theory +  , [ propagator ] where @xmath67 are @xmath3 colour indices . in what follows",
    "it is convenient to write first the following contraction of the field strength propagators ( .",
    "( f    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    _ ) ^ef .)(0 ) = ( _ ^_- _ _ )  .",
    "[ contraction ] it is trivial to check that @xmath68 @xcite . to calculate @xmath69",
    "first we expand the symmetrized trace of @xmath58 in terms of simple traces as & = & + & &  .",
    "[ str ] then using standard perturbative field theory techniques we have ( see also @xcite ) _",
    "4^(x)o_8(z)o_4(0)_h=0=  , [ 3ptf ] and therefore _ 1(x)=-()^4 d^4z  .",
    "notice that we have to be careful in applying wick s theorem to obtain this result .",
    "the reason is that for large @xmath47 only contractions between the fields in @xmath70 and fields that are consecutive in the trace expansion ( [ str ] ) of @xmath58 will contribute .",
    "the other contractions correspond to non - planar graphs and are subleading in the large @xmath47 limit ( see figure ) .",
    "a consequence of this fact is that it was essential that we used the symmetrized trace in the effective action , otherwise we would obtain a different answer . using the result d^4u = p^4  , a simple calculation gives the fourier transform of @xmath69 _",
    "1(p)= -()^4 p^8()^2  , [ fourier ] where @xmath71 is a cut - off scale .",

    "the result is _",
    "i=  , [ result ] which agrees exactly with the classical gravity prediction , including the numerical factors .",
    "we remark that in the perturbative field analysis it seems natural to set the cut - off scale to @xmath73 , while the strong coupled gravity calculation suggests that @xmath74 .",
    "this fact may be related to the existence of colour singlet condensates of w particles at strong coupling with a large binding energy @xcite . however",
    ", a better understanding of the cut - off scale would require the extension of this calculation to the next order @xcite .    in resume ,",
    "we tested the ads / cft duality on the coulomb branch by finding agreement between the gravity and field theory absorption cross sections for the dilaton field near the @xmath3 ir conformal fixed points .",
