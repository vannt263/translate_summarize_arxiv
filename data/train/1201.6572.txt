    "squeezing of the radiation field is one of the distinct features of the quantum theory of light @xcite . squeezed states of light , being nonclassical in origin @xcite , have a reduced variance in one of the quadrature components of the electric field .",

    "theoretical investigations on two - level and three - level atoms demonstrated squeezing either in the total variance of phase quadratures or in the frequency ( spectral ) components of the fluorescence radiation @xcite . for a driven two - level atom , walls and zller first predicted that squeezing can occur in the in - phase / out - of - phase quadrature component of the fluorescent light [ 4a ] .",

    "some experimental evidences of squeezing have also been reported in the phase - dependent spectra of two - level atoms @xcite .",

    "one of the interesting developments in the study of resonance fluorescence is the possibility of modifying spectral properties of the atoms via quantum interferences in spontaneous decay channels .",
    "the interference in spontaneous emission occurs when the atomic transitions are coupled by same vacuum modes .",
    "the early work of agarwal on this subject demonstrated population trapping and generation of quantum coherence between the excited states in a v - type atom @xcite . since the fluorescence properties of a driven atomic system result from its spontaneous emission , studying the influence of interference in such processes has become an important topic of research @xcite .",
