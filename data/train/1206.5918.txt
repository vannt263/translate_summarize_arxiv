    "<S> we show that spin - orbit coupling(soc ) significantly enhances the depletion of a homogeneous bose - einstein condensate in three dimension . with decreasing anisotropy of soc , both quantum and thermal depletion increase . particularly , different types of soc give rise to qualitatively different dependences of condensate depletion on microscopic variables including scattering length , strength of soc and temperature , a novel feature that can be directly observed once these types of soc are realized in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we point out that thermal depletion in three dimension becomes logarithmically divergent at any given finite temperature when both soc and interaction approach the isotropic limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent realization of synthetic spin - orbit coupling(soc ) for ultra cold atoms is an exciting development in the field of quantum gases@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as many experimental parameters , including density , interaction and the configuration of soc itself@xcite , are highly controllable , quantum gases provides physicists an ideal platform to investigate the interplay between soc and interaction in many - body systems , a challenging problem that remains unsolved in condensate matter physics so far @xcite .    in the literature , </S>",
    "<S> extensive studies have predicted a number of novel properties of bose - einstein condensate in the presence of soc@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , condensate depletion , an intrinsic property of bosons , has not been systematically discussed except for a few numerical studies for rashba soc@xcite . in the absence of soc , one important effect of condensate depletion </S>",
    "<S> is that it destroys a condensate at low dimensions . in three dimension , </S>",
    "<S> the depletion for weakly interacting bosons is small and a condensate naturally exists at low temperatures@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the presence of soc , due to the lack of a systematical study of analytic expressions for the condensate depletion , it is unclear how the depletion depends on microscopic parameters , and in particular , on the configuration of soc . in this rapid communication , </S>",
    "<S> we point out that condensate depletion becomes significant even in three dimension in the presence of soc and may completely destroy the condensate at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the explicit forms for the dependence of condensate depletion on the anisotropy and strength of soc , the scattering length , and the temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle hamiltonian with a general soc between two spin states @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 has been assumed without loss of generality . throughout the paper we set @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> while the above conclusion on condensate depletion of non - interacting bosons is unambiguous , it is essential to ask what are the condensate depletion in the presence of both soc and interaction , and how the depletion depends on the anisotropy of soc , which always exists in practice . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the interaction between spin - orbit coupled bosons in the mean - field region@xcite , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the density operator for spin @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the interaction strength . for weak interactions , </S>",
    "<S> chemical potential is much smaller than the energy difference between the bottoms of two branches , i.e. , @xmath24 , the negligible occupation in the higher branch justifies that @xmath25 can be expanded in the lower branch @xmath26 , as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the volume . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 has been assumed to simplify notations .    * bogoliubov spectrum * it has been shown that the mean field ground state in two dimension can be a plane - wave condensate or a stripe phase@xcite . in three dimension , </S>",
    "<S> the situation is similar but more sophisticated @xcite . in this rapid communication , we concrete on the plane - wave condensate at @xmath31 , the mean - field ground state when @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform bogoliubov theory to study the quasi - particle spectrum , which can be written as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 $ ] . for our discussions </S>",
    "<S> , it is useful to enumerate @xmath38 for three particular configurations of soc , ( a ) @xmath39 , @xmath40 , ( b ) @xmath41 , ( c ) @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) is the case when soc exists along only one direction , ( b ) is the rashba coupling , and ( c ) is referred to as isotropic soc and interaction . for these three cases , @xmath38 in low momentum limit have distinct expressions , @xmath43 where * @xmath44 * , the chemical potential @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath47 , @xmath38 represents the quasi - particle spectra in the long wavelength limit . for case ( a ) , </S>",
    "<S> * @xmath38 * is linear along all three directions and characterized by an isotropic sound velocity , i.e. , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 the same as the sound velocity for an ordinary condensate without soc . </S>",
    "<S> for rashba coupling in case ( b ) , the dispersion becomes quadratic along the @xmath50 direction , i.e. , a soft mode emerges(see also @xcite ) . in case ( c ) , </S>",
    "<S> the second soft mode emerges along the @xmath51 direction , and this requires that both soc and interaction are isotropic@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these soft modes have profound effects on condensate depletion .    </S>",
    "<S> * depletion and dos of quasi - particles * in the framework of bogoliubov theory , condensate depletion is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 are quantum and thermal depletion respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that for case ( a ) , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , eqs.([nex_t0],[nex_t ] ) reduce to the ones for an ordinary condensate without soc , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this fact allows a direct comparison among cases with or without soc , as discussed later .    </S>",
    "<S> both the quantum and thermal depletion can be written as functions of a few dimensionless quantities , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the averaged scattering length , and @xmath63 is the healing length . whereas the values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be calculated numerically , it is useful to obtain an analytical expression of them using a qualitative analysis as follows . for quantum depletion in eq.([nex_t0 ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from @xmath66 to the integral is found to be rather small , similar to the case without soc@xcite . in the low energy regime , we further approximate @xmath67 by @xmath68 , its asymptotic value when @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> then eq.([nex_t0 ] ) is reduced to @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the low energy dos of quasi - particles determined by eq.([es ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for thermal depletion in eq.([nex_t ] ) , the dominated contribution to the integral comes from @xmath72 , and eq.([nex_t ] ) can be approximated by @xmath73 for low temperatures @xmath60@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eqs.([an0 ] , [ ant ] ) clearly demonstrate the important effect of @xmath71 on the condensate depletion .    using eq.([qen ] ) , dos of quasi - particles at low @xmath74 for cases ( a - c ) , which are represented by @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively , can be obtained as shown in table i. it is also useful to define an effective dimension according to the power - law behavior of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> considering a @xmath78-dimension system without soc , the phonon - like quasi - particle ( @xmath48 ) gives rise to dos as @xmath79 . as a result , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 correspond to effective dimensions @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced effective dimensions in cases ( b ) and ( c ) strongly indicates that the condensate depletion is significantly enhanced .    substituting the corresponding @xmath71 to eqs.([an0 ] , [ ant ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the analytical expressions for condensate depletion in cases ( a - c ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the tabel in fig.1 , both @xmath64 and @xmath65 take the form of scaling functions of a few microscopic variables . </S>",
    "<S> two important results can be revealed from these forms .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(i ) condensate depletion is largely enhanced in ( b ) and ( c ) , as expected from the observation that @xmath82 is reduced in these two cases . </S>",
    "<S> compared with case ( a ) , @xmath83 is enhanced by a factor of @xmath84 for ( b ) and a factor of @xmath85 for ( c ) . note that here @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath87 continuously increases , there is essentially no upper limit for the enhancement . in current experiments , @xmath88@xcite , where @xmath89 is the wavelength of the raman field , and @xmath90 </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath83 increases severalfold in case ( b ) and ( c ) . for thermal depletion </S>",
    "<S> , the dependence of @xmath91 on temperature becomes @xmath92 in case ( b ) , in addition to the enhancement factor @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the result @xmath93 in case ( a ) , this means an even larger thermal depletion in case ( b ) at low temperatures @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) the most significant effect of soc occurs when considering the thermal depletion in case ( c ) , which diverges , i.e. , @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , _ the thermal depletion in three dimension becomes infinite in bogoliubov theory at any finite temperature when both soc and interaction become isotropic_. this is a direct consequence of the reduction of @xmath82 to @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to point out that , while bogoliubov theory is not expected to be accurate when the depletion becomes close to the total particle number , the above conclusion on the divergent thermal depletion for case ( c ) is consistent with the general argument that long - range order can not exist in a three dimensional system with two soft modes@xcite . when the interaction can be written as @xmath95 , </S>",
    "<S> both the kinetic and interaction energy are constants on the sphere @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> two soft modes then appear along the tangent directions due to phase fluctuations in the long wavelength limit , whereas the density fluctuation is gapped and suppressed by repulsive interaction in this limit as ordinary condensates . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to rashba coupling in two dimension where one soft mode exists@xcite . in our case , the two soft modes in phase fluctuation lead to divergent depletion and the absence of long - range order in case ( c ) .    to verify results ( i ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) , we perform numerical simulations for the condensate depletion based on eqs.([nex_t0 ] , [ nex_t ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first calculate the dependence of @xmath97 and @xmath98 on the anisotropy of soc with a fixed value of @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.(2 ) shows how @xmath97 and @xmath98 evolve when the configuration of soc changes from ( a ) to ( b ) by increasing @xmath100 with @xmath101 and then from ( b ) to ( c ) by increasing @xmath102 with @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that @xmath103 increases from @xmath104% in ( a ) to @xmath105% in ( b ) and finally to @xmath106% in ( c ) . for thermal depletion , @xmath91 at @xmath107 increases from @xmath108% in ( a ) to @xmath109% in ( b ) , and eventually becomes proportional to @xmath110 when @xmath102 approaches @xmath87 , as shown by the red dashed line in fig.(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this logarithmical growth of @xmath91 exists for any finite value of @xmath111 when soc approaches the isotropic limit . therefore , we conclude that @xmath91 is divergent at any finite temperature in ( c ) . to further confirm the scaling forms in fig.(1 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we also calculate the dependence of condensate depletion in case ( a - c ) on dimensionless numbers in eq.([sca ] ) . as shown in the insets of fig.(2 ) , numerical results directly verify these scaling forms .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath91 enters the logarithmic growth region when @xmath112 for the parameters we used . </S>",
    "<S> while it might be challenging for current experiment to access this regime , the enhancement of thermal depletion is already visible far before entering this regime . as fig.2 shows </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath91 increases to @xmath113 when @xmath114 , which means @xmath91 has been enlarged by 50 times compared with case ( a ) . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , eqs.([nexsm ] , [ nexla ] ) can be used to qualitatively describe the thermal depletion in the crossover region from ( b ) to ( c ) . </S>",
