    "interestingly , we find two agns ( j0952 + 1937 and j1520 + 0757 ) with much higher energetics than the majority of agns in our sample .",
    "although these two agns have relatively low bolometric luminosities ( @xmath133erg s@xmath3 ) , their energy injection rate is 2797% of @xmath11 and the momentum flux is 228449 @xmath10 .",
    "in section [ oiii ] and [ ha ] , we investigate various properties , e.g. , flux , velocity , and velocity dispersion , of [ ] and h@xmath4 , respectively , in 1d and 2d , finding that the nlr is a mixture of non - gravitational , i.e. , agn outflows , and gravitational kinematic , i.e. , rotation or random motion ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the non - gravitational kinematics are commonly detected in the broad component of both [ ] and h@xmath4 , which are revealed by their large velocity dispersion compared to the stellar velocity dispersion and/or their large velocity offset with respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy . while the broad components of [ ] and h@xmath4  show qualitatively similar non - gravitational kinematics , the absolute value of velocity and velocity dispersion of h@xmath4  are relatively smaller than those of [ ] .",
    "we find a clear sign of gravitational kinematics ( i.e. , keplerian rotation ) in the narrow component of h@xmath4  for most objects ( 16 out of 20 agn ) .",
    "the other four agns , which do not show any rotation in the narrow component of h@xmath4 , may also have gravitational kinematics such as a random motion . in comparison ,",
    "only 8 out of 20 agns show the gravitational kinematics ( i.e. , rotation or random motion ) in the narrow component of [ ] , implying that the gravitational kinematics are more significantly presented in h@xmath4  than [ ] .",
    "consider a simple picture that biconical outflows and a star - forming disk co - exist in the nucleus .",
    "then , the star - forming disk is responsible for the gravitational kinematics , while the biconical outflows are responsible for the outflow kinematics in the nlr . in general ,",
    "the star - forming region emits the stronger balmer emission than the [ ] emission , so the rotational feature is more distinguishable in h@xmath4  than in [ ] .",
    "for the same reason , the outflowing region , which is ionized by agn , emits stronger [ ] than balmer lines .",
    "thus , the outflow kinematics are more noticeable in [ ] than in h@xmath4 .    in section [ disk ] , we further focus on the origin of rotational features the relation of the narrow component of h@xmath4  with star formation .",
    "we find that 11 agns with sf - type disks show lower @xmath65 and higher @xmath134 indices than the agns with agn - type disks , showing that the agns with sf - type disks have on - going star formation , while five agns with agn - type disks do not .",

    "theoretical studies expect that the outflows is energy conserving if the outflowing gas expand as a hot bubble without efficient cooling , while the outflow is momentum conserving if the outflows rapidly cool down and lose their energy .",
    "agn outflows would generate a different impact on the host galaxy depending whether the outflows are energy- or momentum conserving .",
    "since the driving mechanism depends on the properties of the accretion wind and the ism of the host galaxy , it is still under debate which phase is dominant when and at what physical scales . for example , imagine a scenario where the outflows are initially momentum conserving due to rapid cooling of the wind . in this case , the outflows lose their energy and can not remove the ism , so the smbh grows until it reaches the @xmath27@xmath29 relation . when the smbh has grown enough , the energy - conserving phase starts .",
    "this phase is more energetic than the momentum - conserving phase . as the energy - conserving outflows boost the momentum at larger scales , the outflows sweep the ism and",
    "may suppress the growth of the smbh .",
    "@xcite argue that the energy - conserving outflows are plausible if the wind is fast ( @xmath13610,000 km s@xmath3 ) , or even if the wind is slow ( @xmath1361,000 km s@xmath3 ) with more restricted conditions .    since the momentum flux compared to @xmath137 of our sample are much larger than unity in most cases , we assume that the wind - driven outflows at the nucleus expand to large - scale ( @xmath8kpc ) outflows via the energy - conserving phase as @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath135 are the initial mass outflow rate and initial velocity in the nucleus , respectively .",
    "@xmath140 is an energy transfer efficiency from small - scale wind to large - scale outflow .",
    "we adopt an efficiency of 0.2 based on recent observational results @xcite .    the momentum boost , i.e. , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 and @xmath143 can be calculated by combining with equation 13 as follows @xmath144 by using this equation , we estimate the values of @xmath89 and @xmath145 with the expectations from the energy - conserving outflow by assuming @xmath146 ( figure [ fig : momentum ] ) .",
    "we find that most agns lie within @xmath147 , which is broadly consistent with ultra fast outflows ( ufos , @xmath148 ( 0.10.4)c ) detected in x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we do not find , however , any clear evidence for instantaneous quenching of the star formation due to outflows , since 11 out of 20 agns still show a sign of on - going star formation ( see sections [ disk ] and [ mixture ] ) .    on the contrary ,",
    "if it were the momentum - conserving phase , the momentum boost would be expected to be 0.2 regardless of @xmath89 , which is not the case for our sample .",
    "these results imply that energy - conserving outflows due to accretion - disk wind might be the driving mechanism of the ionized gas outflows observed in the sample .",
    "note that we have two extreme agns with a high momentum boost ( j0952 + 1937 and j1520 + 0757 ) , which lead to un - physically large @xmath149 , although the uncertainties are large .",
    "one possibility is that the @xmath140 factor is larger for these agns due to largely different ism composition . for j1520 + 0757 , however , it is difficult to obtain @xmath150 even with @xmath151 .",
    "another possibility is that the two agns may have much lower @xmath11 at present compared to the time when the outflow was launched , resulting in an overestimated momentum boost compared to the true value .",
    "we will discuss this scenario in the following section .      in sections [ int_energetics ] and [ origin ] , we find two agns with extreme energetics , while their bolometric luminosities are relatively low ( j0952 + 1937 and j1520 + 0757 ) .",
    "these two agns have the lowest electron density among the sample ( @xmath81=78 and 54 @xmath80 , respectively ) , implying that the ionized gas has possibly been swept out , which is consistent with their high mass outflow rate ( @xmath104=17.7 and 9.2 @xmath74 yr@xmath3 , respectively ) .",
    "then , what can cause the discrepancy between their energetics , e.g. , energy injection rate and momentum flux , and the bolometric luminosity ? since we measured the bolometric luminosity of agns based on the [ ] luminosity in the nlr , the difference between the photoionization timescale ( @xmath8@xmath82 years ) and the dynamical timescale of the outflows ( @xmath8@xmath152 years ) to reach the nlr may cause the discrepancy .",
    "we note that this is the same explanation for the weak relationship between @xmath44 and the [ ] luminosity ( see figure [ fig : size_lum_kin ] ) .",
    "let s consider the energy - conserving outflow expanding from high velocity , small - scale winds close to the nucleus ( see section [ origin ] ) .",
    "as the winds expand , the hot bubble would sweep out the surrounding ism and the outflow velocity would become smaller . if we simply consider the constant outflow velocity of 1000 km s@xmath3 , it will take @xmath152 years , which is the dynamical timescale of outflows , to reach the ism up to @xmath44 of 1 kpc . also , we find that the mean mass outflow rate is @xmath84.6 @xmath7 yr@xmath3 for the sample , so the ionized gas within @xmath23 will be removed after @xmath810@xmath153 years .",
    "since the outflow would sweep out the ism in the vicinity of the smbh within a much shorter time scale @xmath15410@xmath153 years , it is possible that the agn becomes inactive while the outflows propagate in the nlr ( @xmath8kpc ) .",
    "hence , the agn can be inactive or less luminous when the powerful outflow reaches the nlr .      from the integrated spectra within @xmath23",
    ", we estimate the physical properties related to the energetics of gas outflows , such as mass outflow rate , energy injection rate , and momentum flux ( section [ int_energetics ] ) .",
    "we find the mean outflow velocity @xmath115800 km s@xmath3 and the mean @xmath155900 pc .",
    "the dynamical time @xmath156 is given by @xmath15710@xmath158 years , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the theoretical expectation of 10@xmath159 years for quasar lifetimes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the agns have a mass outflow rate @xmath104 = 0.317.7 @xmath7 yr@xmath3 with a mean value of @xmath84.6 @xmath7 yr@xmath3 , which is a factor of @xmath8300 larger than the mean mass accretion rate @xmath1300.02 @xmath7 yr@xmath3 . for",
    "this mean gas mass for agns ( @xmath81.4@xmath910@xmath158 @xmath7 ) and mean mass outflow rate ( @xmath84.6 @xmath7 yr@xmath3 ) , it would take @xmath8(4.2@xmath63.1)@xmath910@xmath153 years to remove the ionized gas from the @xmath1601 kpc , which is less than the dynamical timescale of agns @xmath810@xmath158 years .",
    "such gas removal timescale ( @xmath84.2@xmath910@xmath153 years ) is comparable to the agn flickering timescale @xmath810@xmath153 years @xcite .    from the quantitative estimations ,",
    "we show that the agn outflows can remove the ionized gas within @xmath23 in a reasonably short timescale , implying that star formation within @xmath81 kpc of agn can be affected by agn outflows . in section [ disk ] , for example , we find that @xmath830% of agns with a disk are agn - type disks , which is possibly affected by agn photoionization .",
    "the higher @xmath65 and smaller h@xmath66 of the agns with agn - type disks indicate a relatively low star - formation rate within the central kpc of the agns .",
    "we do not find , however , any differences between the agns with agn - type and sf - type disks in terms of outflow energetics ( figures [ fig : e_comparison ] , [ fig : lbol_vs_em ] , and [ fig : momentum ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , the most kinematically energetic agns of our sample , i.e. , j0952 + 1937 and j1520 + 0757 , may provide an insight into agn feedback .",
    "for example ,",
    "j1520 + 0757 has no detectable rotational feature in h@xmath4 , residing in the `` green valley '' with log ssfr=@xmath2010.9 yr@xmath3 . on the other hand",
    ", j0952 + 1937 has a sf - type disk and harbors on - going star formation with log ssfr=@xmath209.5 yr@xmath3 ( see figure [ fig : ssfr ] ) . if the outflows in these agns are powerful enough to affect the star formation in the host galaxy , their different ssfrs are possibly due to different geometry of outflows with respect to the star - forming disk .",
    "this speculation can be tested using high spatial resolution ifu observations combined with a proper modeling of a mixed kinematics of outflows and disk rotation .",
    "alternatively , the outflows may not be powerful enough to immediately quench the star formation in the host galaxy , although the ionized gas shows evidence of powerful outflows .",
    "recent numerical simulations show the inefficiency of agn outflows in quenching star formation , because the outflows are mostly affecting ionized gas , rather than dense molecular gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this scenario can be tested whether the object shows outflow features in molecular gas as well as ionized gas via , e.g. , alma observations .",
    "do agn outflows also affect star formation on galactic scales ( @xmath810 kpc ) ? from our results , it would be difficult for our intermediate - luminosity agns , because of the steeply decreasing energy and momentum as a function of distance ( see section [ sr_energetics ] ) .",
    "also , @xcite showed that @xmath890% of outflow energy and momentum are within a @xmath812 kpc region ( @xmath8@xmath44 ) in type 2 agns , implying that energy injected by agn outflows would become smaller and eventually negligible at larger distance , e.g. , @xmath810 kpc , for the agn luminosities of our sample .    in section [ disk ] , we find that the agns with sf - type disks are located on the main sequence of star - forming galaxies , while the agns with agn - type disks are below the main sequence .",
    "the global ssfr of host galaxies of the agns with agn - type disks is on average @xmath81 order of magnitude smaller than that in the agns with sf - type disks .",
    "does the low ssfr in the sample of agn - type disks support the agn feedback in galactic scales ? by considering that the agns with agn - type disks are on average a factor of @xmath83.5 more massive than the agns with sf - type disks ( see section [ disk ] ) , it is difficult to conclude that the low ssfrs support the galactic scale agn feedback , although it is a plausible scenario .",
    "it is because such low ssfrs in massive galaxies can also be accounted for alternative quenching mechanisms , e.g. , environmental quenching ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more ifu - observed samples within similar mass scales may provide a hint for the primary quenching mechanism .",

    "<S> to investigate agn outflows as a tracer of agn feedback on star - formation , we perform integral - field spectroscopy of 20 type 2 agns at z@xmath00.1 , which are luminous agns with the [ ] luminosity @xmath110@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 , and exhibit strong outflow signatures in the [ ] kinematics . by decomposing the emission - line profile </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the maps of the narrow and broad components of [ ] and h@xmath4  lines , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the broad components in both [ ] and h@xmath4  represent the non - gravitational kinematics , i.e. , gas outflows , while the narrow components , especially in h@xmath4 , represent the gravitational kinematics , i.e. , rotational disk . by using the integrated spectra within the flux - weighted size of the narrow - line region </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the energetics of the gas outflows . </S>",
    "<S> the ionized gas mass is 1.038.5@xmath5 , and the mean mass outflow rate is 4.6@xmath64.3 @xmath7 yr@xmath3 , which is a factor of @xmath8260 higher than the mean mass accretion rate 0.02@xmath60.01 @xmath7 yr@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> . the mean energy injection rate of the sample is 0.8@xmath60.6% of the agn bolometric luminosity , while the momentum flux is ( 5.4@xmath63.6)@xmath9@xmath10 on average , except for two most kinematically energetic agns with low @xmath11 , which are possibly due to the dynamical timescale of the outflows . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated outflow energetics are consistent with the theoretical expectations for energy - conserving outflows from agns , yet we find no supporting evidence of instantaneous quenching of star formation due to the outflows . </S>"
