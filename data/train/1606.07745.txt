    "rcw 86 ( also known as msh 14@xmath563 or g315.4@xmath52.3 ) is one of the supernova remnants ( snrs ) that has been detected in the whole electromagnetic spectrum , from the radio continuum , optical , and infrared domains to the energetic x - rays and gev / tev @xmath6-rays .",
    "of particular interest are the bright tev @xmath6-rays and non - thermal x - rays , which are tightly related with the production of cosmic - rays ( crs ) via the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) mechanism in snrs @xcite .",
    "rcw 86 is therefore suitable for studying the origin of galactic crs in an energy range @xmath7 ev and their relationship with the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) by using multi - wavelength datasets .",
    "rcw 86 is a relatively young snr , first recorded in ad 185 in the chinese historical book @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the snr is located slightly away from the galactic plane ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , at only @xmath14 kpc from us .",
    "the shell - like morphology of rcw 86 was first discovered in radio continuum observations @xcite .",
    "after half a century , such morphology has been confirmed at all wavelengths , including @xmath6-rays .",
    "the observed diameter is approximately 40 arcmin , corresponding to a diameter of @xmath15 pc at 2.5 kpc .",
    "the progenitor system of rcw 86 ( type ia or core - collapse ( cc ) ) remains contentious .",
    "the cc hypothesis is supported by the presence of several b - type stars in the neighbourhood of rcw 86 @xcite .",
    "however , recent optical and x - ray studies reporting fe - rich ejecta and balmer filaments encircling the shell suggest a type ia explosion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "besides , rcw 86 lacks a central compact object such as a neutron star or region of o - rich ejecta .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that rcw 86 is a cc snr .",
    "according to numerical simulations , the progenitor system is also consistent with an off - centered type ia explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the red , green , and blue colors represent the energy bands , 0.51.0 , 1.02.0 , and 2.04.5 kev , respectively .",
    "the white solid line indicates the region observed with the mos and pn detectors .",
    "contours represent the most radio continuum at a frequency of 843 mhz .",
    "the contour levels are 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 , and 160 mjy beam@xmath17,width=328 ]    rcw 86 has received much attention since the discovery of tev @xmath6-ray emission with the high - energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) by @xcite .",
    "the tev @xmath6-ray flux of rcw 86 is ten times lower than that of the crab nebula , but the origin of which is not yet settled .",
    "subsequently , and @xcite obtained gev @xmath6-ray images and spectra with the @xmath18 large area telescope ( lat ) . by using a broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting",
    ", they also discussed whether the @xmath6-rays are hadronic or leptonic in origin .",
    "they concluded that the leptonic origin was more reasonable , but the low photon statistics did not rule out a hadronic origin .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the new h.e.s.s .",
    "dataset and revealed the shell - like morphology in tev @xmath6-rays , the origin of which is not yet discerned .",
    "most recently , @xcite obtained new gev @xmath6-ray images and spectra from a 6.5-year dataset of @xmath18 lat .",
    "they concluded that the broad - band sed favors the leptonic origin under the two - zone model .",
    "if the process is hadronic , the @xmath6-rays should spatially correspond to the interstellar gas .",
    "therefore , a detailed spatial comparison between the interstellar gas and @xmath6-rays is highly desirable in order to establish origin of the high energy emission .",

    "to summarize , a thorough investigation of the ism is extremely important to study the progenitor system , the origin of thermal x - rays , the acceleration mechanism of cr electrons , and the shock dynamics of snrs .",
    "observations of the ism at high angular resolution better than 45 arcsec will allow us to make a comparison of small - scale structures of the ism with observations at the other wavelengths , and will enable us to pursue more detailed physical process . a spectral analysis of the x - ray data is indispensable to derive the distributions of the photon index and the roll - off energy and provide a firm basis to elucidate the relationship between the cr acceleration and the ism . the synchrotron radiation above 10 kev from the electrons accelerated by the reverse shock will be obtained in the hard x - ray imaging with @xmath266 . @xmath257",
    "high - resolution measurements of the proper motion will reveal the kinematics of the x - ray filaments in detail .",
    "we summarize the present work as follows .    1 .",
    "we have revealed atomic and molecular gas associated with the young tev @xmath6-ray snr rcw 86 by using nanten2 co and atca @xmath40 parkes hi datasets .",
    "the hi gas is distributed surrounding the x - ray shell and shows a cavity - like distribution with an expanding velocity of @xmath226 km s@xmath2 , while the co clouds are located only in the east , south , and northwest , showing the high - intensity ratio of co @xmath3 = 21/10 ratio @xmath267 enhanced by the shock heating and/or compression in the surface of the clouds .",
    "2 .   thermal x - ray filaments show a good spatial correspondence with the hi wall and small - scale structures of co clouds .",
    "we also found a correlation between the total proton column density and the thermal x - ray intensity .",
    "this indicates that the atomic / molecular gas of density 10100 @xmath4 is associated with the snr shockwaves .",
    "non - thermal x - rays are bright both in the gas - rich and -poor regions .",
    "we interpret that the shock - cloud interaction between the cold hi clumps and the high shock velocity could enhance the non - thermal x - rays , which is a situation similar to that discussed by @xcite in the snr rx j1713.7@xmath53946 .",
    "in addition , the reverse shock is detected only in the gas - rich region with a total proton column density of @xmath268 @xmath113 or higher .",
    "our study confirms that the progenitor of rcw 86 was a system consisting of a white dwarf and a low - mass star with low - velocity accretion winds , as suggested by @xcite .",

    "first , we investigated the spatial correlation and anti - correlation between the x - ray and interstellar gas ( co and hi ) distributions .",

    "apparently , the hi cloud at a radial velocity from @xmath270 to 0 km s@xmath2 is also well correlated with the x - ray shell ; however , as it is a local cloud component , we ignored it from the standpoint of interaction with the snr .    99 aharonian , f. , akhperjanian , a.  g. , bazer - bachi , a.  r. , et al .",
