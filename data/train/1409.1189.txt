    "early studies of emission line galaxies have shown that objects that spectroscopically resembled hii regions both in line emission intensities and widths , constituted about 80 per cent of total samples , the rest being galaxies of seyfert type ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "some of these objects are also characterised by their compacticity and blue excess as shown on photographic plates and represent the overlap between blue compact galaxies ( bcg ) and hii galaxies .",
    "_ phl  293 b _ is one of these objects .",
    "it was found by @xcite in the `` palomar - haro - luyten '' survey of faint blue objects . @xcite",
    "obtained its optical spectrum and described it as having a faint continuum with unresolved emission in the balmer series and [ oiii ] @xmath25007,4959 and 4363  that makes of it , to our knowledge , one of the first detections of the [ oiii]@xmath34363  auroral line in a star forming galaxy .",
    "we nowadays recognize this fact as the one allowing a trustworthy derivation of the gas elemental abundances in regions of star formation showing an emission line spectrum . in the case of _",
    "phl  293 b _",
    ", these abundances are amongst the lowest known , less than one tenth of the solar value @xcite and in the border line of what is considered to be an extremely metal deficient galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the galaxy was included in the sample studied by @xcite who lists its absolute magnitude and size as -13.6 and 0.2 kpc respectively .",
    "_ phl  293b _ also looks compact in the images obtained by @xcite , and @xcite give an effective radius for this galaxy of only 0.4 kpc .",
    "its absolute magnitude according to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is , m@xmath4 = -14.77 .",
    "these facts make of it a very low luminosity and compact hii galaxy .",
    "one of the characteristics of hii galaxies is their high star formation rate that takes place in a very small volume and probably in short duration episodes , thus making these galaxies easily observable .",
    "given the large value of the equivalent width of their emission lines , it is the current burst of star formation that dominates their luminosity at blue and visible wavelengths .",
    "the low metallicity of these objects guarantees that they are in a chemically unevolved stage probably similar to what is expected in galaxies at early cosmological times",
    ". the evolution of their massive young stars , responsible for the gas ionisation , is conditioned by their low metallicity as is probably the case for pop iii stars .",
    "the evolution of high mass stars is short and encompasses phases with intense episodes of mass loss , therefore the presence of low intensity broad components or wings in the otherwise narrow emission lines typical of star - forming regions ( sfr ) , are relatively common in high s / n medium resolution spectra .",
    "well known examples are : ngc  604 , a giant hii region in the spiral galaxy m  33 @xcite ; ngc  5471 , a giant hii region in the spiral galaxy m  101 @xcite , ngc  2363 , a giant hii region in the irregular galaxy ngc  2366 @xcite and 30  dor in the lmc , one of the largest extragalactic hii regions in the local universe @xcite .",
    "this is also the case , as expected , for hii galaxies and strong line bcg ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since it is the dominant star forming region that dominates their integrated spectra .",
    "the most likely origin of the extended line wings observed in sfr is related to the evolution of very massive stars and the feedback processes between them and the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "given the large number of these stars present in a relatively small volume , it may be expected that the combination of their powerful winds gave rise to complex kinematical components in both permitted and forbidden lines .",
    "also multiple supernova events have been invoked as the possible cause ( see * ? ? ? * for the case of ngc  2363 ) . however , some of these massive stars like luminous blue variables ( lbv ) , can be so luminous as to be capable of producing visible effects by themselves particularly in nearby resolved system and some of them may even end their lives as supernovae hence dominating for some time the galaxy luminosity output",
    ". this evolutionary path may be the one followed by the most massive stars of low metallicity for which the inefficiency of line - driven stellar winds would translate in a low mass - loss rate and failure in becoming a wr star .",
    "some of these stars might be the progenitors of type iin supernovae in which the narrow line spectrum arises from the interaction of the supernova blast wave with the circumstellar shell .",
    "these supernovae can be very luminous and also very long lived ( aretxaga et al .",
    "1999 ; smith et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "another mechanism accounting for the presence of low intensity broad line components in hii galaxies or bcg spectra may be mass accretion onto an intermediate - mass black hole ( 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 ) . up to",
    "now there are no _ bona fide _ low metallicity objects ( about one tenth of solar ) harbouring massive black holes .",
    "in fact , it is intrinsically difficult to identify these objects in commonly used diagnostic diagrams ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the overlapping of their broad component h@xmath8 luminosities and those of supernovae and even stellar winds , makes this identification even harder . yet , from the point of view of galactic evolution to firmly establish the existence of these objects would be of the greatest importance . in this sense the detection of x rays emission would be a major discriminant .    in this work we analyse",
    "recently obtained moderate to high resolution spectra of _ phl  293b _ which is a low luminosity , low metallicity hii galaxy that shows low intensity broad wings and blue shifted narrow absorptions in the hydrogen recombination lines , in order to try to shed some light on their origin .",

    "one fact supporting the hypothesis of the presence of a transient object would be the detection of long term variability in the flux from _ phl  293b_. however , as stated in  [ photvar ] , we can conclude that there is no variability at the level of a few hundredths of magnitude over 25 years .",

    "the caveat in that case is that , if the variable component is that faint in relation with the ionising cluster , it will be difficult to explain the observed strength of the balmer and feii absorptions .      an alternative scenario for the broad lines and pseudo p  cygni profiles in _ phl  293b _ is that they are originated in an evolved sn type iin .",
    "it is usually assumed that sn  iin explode inside the circumstellar material previously ejected in the form of a slow dense wind by the red supergiant sn progenitor .",
    "what is observed is the result of the interaction between the ejecta and this slowly expanding dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) which transforms the mechanical energy of the ejecta into radiation .",

    "* ) . a significant constraint on the sn  iin / compact remnant scenario is the long term lack of variability in _ phl  293b_. the secular variability of the broad lines in this scenario comes from the evolution of the interaction of the ejecta and the circumstellar medium , i.e. the evolution of the compact remnant .",
    "the evolution of the blue light - curve can be parametrized as @xmath60 @xcite with its peak luminosity being a function of the circumstellar density ( @xmath61 ) .",

    ", we find that a compact remnant of age @xmath66 years evolving in a medium with density @xmath67 @xmath42 would have shown a decline of about 1.5 magnitudes since maximum and of about 0.1 magnitudes in the last 10 years .",
    "we can estimate its line luminosities using the models of @xcite .",
    "the observed luminosity of the broad component of h@xmath8  is :    @xmath68    from the analytical solutions of @xcite and tables 1.1 and 1.2 of @xcite it is possible to estimate that a compact remnant evolving in a medium with @xmath67 @xmath42 would have a shock velocity of 800 km / s at an age defined by @xmath69 of about 112 yr .",
    "predicted values for the shock parameters and h@xmath8 corresponding to such age are :    @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 and the fwzi of the broad component is about twice the shock velocity or 1600 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "given its temperature , the remnant is expected to emit in x rays up to about few kev with a luminosity just below @xmath75erg s@xmath10 .",
    "these values are too large compared with the observed upper limit of @xmath76erg s@xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the expected drop in luminosity 7.5 years later i.e. at an age of 119.5 yr is 10 % or about 0.1 magnitudes and the drop in luminosity in 20 years is about 0.2 magnitudes , thus we can safely conclude that the observed upper limit on the variability of _ phl  293b _ makes it very difficult for the observed absorptions and broad emission to be originated in a sn type iin .    in summary , we have evidence that an old compact remnant could explain the observed broad lines and the dense shell responsible for the blue - shifted absorptions in _ phl 293b_. but , while the observed line properties are in rough agreement with a compact remnant slightly older than 100 years , this age is much smaller than the age derived from the absolute blue magnitude limit imposed by the lack of variability and furthermore the expected variability in h@xmath8 at 100 years is also too large compared with the limits deduced from the data .      to see if there is some information in the data regarding the spatial distribution of the absorbers , we compared in table [ feii ] the ew measurements of the hydrogen absorptions that are supposed to cover most of the source of the continuum , with the ones of the feii lines taking as reference the ew of [ oiii]@xmath35007   that is expected to extend beyond most of the ionising cluster continuum but to be still inside the host galaxy continuum .",

    "as expected there is a slight increase in the ew measured with the smaller _ x - shooter _ aperture ( 1 arcsec ) compared with the 3 arcsec circular aperture of the sdss spectrum ( although determination of faint continuum contribution can also account for such variations among spectra ) .",

    "their ratio of the broad to total h@xmath8 flux is , for both sdss and x - shooter observations , the same within errors , about 0.21 showing no indication of variability as already discussed .",
    "the lack of variability imposes a strong constraint for scenarios involving discrete transient sources like lbv or sn  iin . at the same time",
    "the lack of variability suggests that the origin of the blue shifted absorptions could be associated with a global process involving a large part of the ionising cluster .",
    "furthermore we have to address the fact that what we are witnessing in the feii lines and perhaps also in the balmer series in _",
    "phl 293b _ are blue shifted absorptions without the associated narrow emissions typical of classical p  cygni profiles .",
    "this lack of associated emissions indicates that the material responsible for the detected absorptions , while covering a large part of the continuum source , is not an extended circum - cluster medium ( ccm ) .",

    "this fact and the observed lack of variability over many years suggest a scenario where the blueshifted absorptions found in _",

    "this dense shell expanding at 800 km / s produces the observed blue shifted absorptions in h and fe following catastrophic radiative cooling in a scenario similar to the case of the compact supernova remnant described above . the main difference being that instead of an instantaneous input of energy and mass the wind scenario involves a constant rate . as the cluster wind shocks the surrounding ism it will generate , given adequate conditions , a post shock high density supershell that will be ionised by the cluster uv output modified by the radiative shock emission .",

    "<S> we find broad ( fwhm = 1000km / s ) and very broad ( fwzi = 4000km / s ) components in the balmer lines , narrow absorption components in the balmer series blueshifted by 800km / s , previously undetected feii multiplet ( 42 ) absorptions also blueshifted by 800km / s , ir caii triplet stellar absorptions consistent with [ fe / h ] @xmath0 and no broad components or blushifted absorptions in the hei lines . based on historical records , we found no optical variability at the 5 @xmath1 level of 0.02 mag between 2005 and 2013 and no optical variability at the level of 0.1mag for the past 24 years .    </S>",
    "<S> the lack of variability rules out transient phenomena like luminous blue variables or sn  iin as the origin of the blue shifted absorptions of hi and feii . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence points to either a young and dense expanding supershell or a stationary cooling wind , in both cases driven by the young cluster wind .    </S>",
