    "the connection between some gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and supernovae ( sne ) is now well established ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . the first observational clue for a connection came with the discovery of a bright sn coincident in time and space with grb980425 @xcite .",
    "the sn was eventually classified as a type ic ( for a definition of the class , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating an origin from a massive star that lost both the h and he envelopes prior to core collapse .",
    "sn1998bw was an exceptional sn  ic in being very luminous and showing a broad - lined spectrum , indicative of a large kinetic energy of expansion .",
    "such objects have been called hypernovae @xcite or broad - lined sne  ic ( sne  ic - bl ; see * ? ? ?",
    "modelling confirmed the large kinetic energy , @xmath11erg , and showed that the ejected mass was also quite large ( @xmath12 , * ? ? ? * ) , pointing to a progenitor star with zero - age main sequence ( zams ) mass @xmath13 .",
    "later , other nearby long - duration soft - spectrum grbs , in the same high - energy class as grb 980425 , were also seen to accompany hypernovae / sne  ic - bl , confirming the connection @xcite .",
    "the sne had properties very similar to those of sn1998bw , although the properties of the grbs were quite different @xcite . in a popular model , both the sn and the grb",
    "are produced when the rapidly rotating core of a massive star collapses to form a black hole @xcite .",
    "the coincidence of a very aspherical event , the grb , and a sn motivates the search for signatures of asphericity in the sn as well .    in the case of sn1998bw ,",
    "evidence of asphericity came from the nebular spectra .",
    "these showed strong emission lines of both [ oi ] @xmath146300 , 6363 and [ feii ] ( a blend near 5200 ) , as could be expected from a bright sn  ic , but with the peculiarity that even after accounting for blending the [ feii ] lines were broader than the [ oi ] line , indicating a higher expansion velocity of fe than of o. this was explained in the context of an axisymmetric explosion , where the fe produced by the decay of @xmath5ni  is ejected at high velocities near the direction of the grb jet while oxygen , which is mostly not a product of the explosion but rather left over from the progenitor , is ejected at lower velocities nearer the equator @xcite .",
    "@xcite supported this scenario with two - dimensional explosion models and three - dimensional synthetic nebular spectra , and suggested that our viewing angle was @xmath15 from the jet axis ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". this may partly be responsible for the weakness of grb980425 @xcite .    in the case of sn2003dh / grb030329 , polarization levels of @xmath16%",
    "were observed in the first 23 days after the grb , but they were probably measurements of the grb afterglow ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , dominated by the synchrotron process which imposes partial polarization .",
    "later polarization measurements , which should not have been affected by the afterglow , suggested that the polarization was small ( @xmath17% ) , although the alignment of the polarization angle suggests that the polarization is non - zero @xcite .",
    "this could be consistent with a jet - like explosion viewed very close to the jet axis , as the strength of grb030329 may suggest .",
    "a later confirmation that the ejecta of bright sne  ic can be very aspherical came from the detection of the double - peaked emission profile of the [ oi ] @xmath146300 , 6363 line in sn2003jd @xcite .",
    "the profile could be reproduced assuming that we observed an explosion similar to that of sn1998bw from close to the equatorial plane .",
    "a grb may or may not @xcite have been produced , and if it was it may not have been detected because it was not pointing toward the earth .",
    "asphericity may indeed be a common feature of core - collapse sne @xcite , and it is probably stronger in the carbon - oxygen cores , since envelope - stripped sne show a higher degree of polarization @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetry of the non - grb , broad - lined snic 2002ap @xcite revealed polarization of up to @xmath16% in the oi  @xmath187774 line and in the caii  ir triplet at early times , suggesting a deviation from sphericity of @xmath19% .",
    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) are a lower - energy and softer subclass of long - duration grbs @xcite . previous work had indicated a connection between xrfs and sne @xcite but high - quality spectra of the sne had not been obtained until the type ic sn2006aj was discovered coincident with xrf060218 , at a redshift @xmath20 @xcite . although sn2006aj showed a broad - lined spectrum , this was not as broad as those of sne1998bw and 2003dh .",
    "therefore , sn2006aj could not , _ prima facie _ , be considered an extremely energetic sn from early optical spectroscopy and photometry .",
    "radio observations confirmed this @xcite .",
    "sn2006aj was modelled @xcite to have synthesized only @xmath21 of @xmath5ni , and to have ejecta only slightly more massive ( @xmath22 ) and energetic ( @xmath23erg ) than  normal \" sne  ic.erg , although it is by no means clear that this can be called a normal event . ]",
    "these parameters are more appropriate for the collapse of a star of @xmath24 to a neutron star .",
    "@xcite suggested that magnetic activity on the surface of the nascent neutron star increased the energy of the explosion and caused the xrf . in this case , the explosion may not be highly aspherical .",
    "the absence of a jet break and the behavior of the radio flux led @xcite to estimate a  jet \" opening angle of @xmath25 .",
    "large polarization ( @xmath26% at 35 days ) was observed in sn2006aj @xcite . as in the case of sn2003dh",
    ", this may have been due to the relativistic jet and the xrf afterglow synchrotron continuum , but as the data have a later epoch than those of sn2003dh @xcite , and the afterglow was not as strong as in the case of sn2003dh , an aspherical fast outflow from the outermost sn ejecta may also have been detected . at later epochs ,",
    "@xcite find that the polarization level dropped to @xmath27% , which they attribute to the host galaxy .    obviously , it is important to verify these suggestions using nebular spectroscopy .",
    "we observed sn2006aj with the kecki telescope and the very large telescope ( vlt ) when it became visible again after solar occultation . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the observations (  2 ) , present the observational results (  3 ) and the models of the nebular spectra (  4 ) , and discuss our findings (  5 ) .",
    "on 2006 july 26.61 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) , sn2006aj was observed with the 10-m kecki telescope on mauna kea , hawaii , equipped with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a d560 dichroic to separate the blue and red light paths .",
    "the seeing was about @xmath28 , and a long slit of width @xmath29 was aligned along a position angle of @xmath30 .",
    "although the parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ) at that time was @xmath31 , the atmospheric dispersion was not very significant , given the relatively low airmass ( 1.3 ) .",
    "the blue - side data were taken with the 600/4000 grism , giving a spectral resolution of 3.5 , while the red - side data were taken with the 400/8500 grating , giving a spectral resolution of 6.4 .",
    "two 600s exposures were obtained .",
    "standard ccd processing was accomplished with iraf .",
    "the data were extracted using the optimal algorithm of @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained from internal arc lamps and slight adjustments were derived from night - sky lines .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard stars bd+284211 and bd+174708 ( observed at the parallactic angle ) , as well as our own idl routines , were used for flux calibration and telluric absorption removal @xcite .    on 2006",
    "september 19.33 and 20.36 , sn2006aj was observed with the 8-m vlt kueyen of the european southern observatory ( eso ) at cerro paranal , equipped with the focal reducer spectrograph ( fors1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in polarimetric mode .",
    "the observations were performed with the 300v grism and a @xmath32 wide slit , aligned along the parallactic angle , giving a dispersion of @xmath02.6 pixel@xmath2 and a resolution of @xmath011  at 5500  ( full width at half - maximum intensity ) .",
    "the wavelength coverage achieved with this setup is 33008600 . at both epochs the sn",
    "was observed at four half - wave plate position angles ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) , for a total integration time of 7200s .",
    "the seeing was @xmath37 on september 19 and @xmath38 on september 20 .",
    "the data were bias - subtracted , flattened , and wavelength - calibrated using standard tasks within iraf .",
    "stokes parameters , linear polarization degree , and position angle were computed using specific routines written by the authors .",
    "finally , polarization bias correction and error estimates were performed following the prescriptions described by @xcite , while the half - wave plate zeropoint angle chromatism was corrected using fors1 tabulated data . in order to reduce the noise ,",
    "the two data sets have been combined and the final stokes parameters rebinned to 75  bins ( 29 pixels ) . the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the binned flux spectrum is @xmath0100 in the [ oi ] @xmath146300 , 6363 region , corresponding to an expected root - mean square uncertainty in the polarization degree of @xmath39% .",
    "photometric calibration of the spectra was achieved by observing spectrophotometric standard stars with full polarimetric optics inserted .",
    "instrumental polarization and position angle offset were checked by observing polarized and unpolarized standard stars , within the fors1 calibration plan .",
    "the total - flux spectrum was obtained combining all exposures , giving s / n @xmath40 in the continuum at 6000 . at this advanced nebular phase",
    ", the only relevant sn signal is expected to be associated with the nebular emission lines .",
    "therefore , we attributed all observed continuum to the host galaxy .",
    "the continuum was evaluated in four spectral regions ( near 4400 , i.e. , immediately blueward of the mgi ] line ; at 6200  and 7020 , i.e. , on either side of the [ oi ] line ; and at 8170 ) , and was then interpolated at all wavelengths of our spectral range with a spline and subtracted , along with the host - galaxy emission lines , from the observed spectra .",
    "we thus obtained the pure sn emission line spectrum .    in order to compute line",
    "intensities the spectral flux was converted to physical units .",
    "the sn spectrum is superposed on the host - galaxy continuum .",
    "galaxy photometry , however , includes narrow host - galaxy emission lines @xcite .",
    "the flux level of the sn spectra is however best established by comparing to the galaxy continuum .",
    "therefore , first we estimated from the observed spectra the fractional contribution of the host - galaxy emission lines to the galaxy photometry in each filter , and hence determined the photometric level of the galaxy spectral continuum .",
    "this allowed us to evaluate the flux level of the observed and subtracted sn spectra , and ultimately to estimate the intensities of the sn nebular emission lines .",
    "as the host galaxy of sn2006aj is very small and compact , the fraction of galaxy and sn light possibly not included in the slit during spectroscopy should be similar , ensuring that our method does not substantially underestimate the galaxy contribution .",
    "figure 1 shows the observed vlt spectrum , the fiducial galaxy spectrum , the observed spectrum recalibrated according to the galaxy photometry , as explained above , and the subtracted sn spectrum , calibrated and cleaned of cosmic rays .",
    "close inspection of the vlt - fors1 polarization data shows no detection of linear polarization , either in the continuum or in the most prominent emission line , [ oi ] @xmath146300 , 6363 ; only a conservative 3@xmath41 upper limit of 2% across the whole wavelength range could be set . considering that a polarization level of @xmath42% may be attributed to the host galaxy @xcite , and that interstellar polarization may contribute a similar amount @xmath43 $ ] , this is consistent with unpolarized sn flux , and with a global ellipticity of the inner sn ejecta ( i.e. at @xmath4kms@xmath2 ) of no more than 10% @xcite .",
    "this is not expected to be observable in the profiles of the nebular emission lines .",
    "we derived sn magnitudes @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for the keck data ( rest - frame epoch 153 days ) , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for the vlt data ( rest - frame epoch 206 days ) .",
    "we assign an uncertainty of @xmath51 mag in the @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 bands , and 0.2 mag in the @xmath55 band .",
    "the average light curve decline rate in this period is then @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58mag(100 days)@xmath2 in the @xmath53 , @xmath52 , and @xmath54 bands , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with expectation for a late - time light curve powered by gamma rays from @xmath5co decay in relatively transparent sn ejecta and is also consistent with other sne  ibc such as sn1998bw @xcite and sn2002ap @xcite .",
    "the keck spectrum , obtained on 2006 july 26 , has a rest - frame epoch of 153 days .",
    "figure 2 shows a comparison with the sn1998bw spectrum obtained on 1998 september 12 , at an epoch of 139 days after the explosion , which is assumed to have occurred on 25 april 1998 , in coincidence with grb980425 @xcite .",
    "the two spectra are very similar , but obviously the [ oi ] line is stronger relative to all other lines in sn2006aj .",
    "the vlt spectrum , obtained on 2006 sept 1920 , has a rest - frame epoch of 206 days .",
    "it is shown in figure 3 compared to the spectrum of sn1998bw obtained on 1998 november 26 , at a rest - frame epoch of 216 days after the explosion .",
    "again , [ oi ] @xmath146300 , 6363 is by far the strongest emission line , and is stronger in sn2006aj than in sn1998bw relative to the other lines , indicating that oxygen dominates the composition of the ejecta .",
    "the next strongest lines are near 4600 , corresponding to mgi ] @xmath184571 , and a line near 7400 .",
    "this is too red to be caii ] @xmath147291,7324 , and [ niii ] @xmath187380 is the best candidate @xcite .",
    "the wavelength of the emission near 8700in the keck spectrum suggests that the caii  ir triplet is not the only contributor , and that [ ci ] @xmath188727 is also strong .",
    "the [ feii ] lines are relatively weak , but still form an emission feature near 5300 .",
    "the strongest lines in that complex have rest wavelengths 5159 , 5262 , 5273 , and 5334 .",
    "[ feiii ] lines are very weak , as in all sn  ic spectra , indicating low temperature and significant clumping .",
    "the profile of the emission lines in the nebular spectrum of sn2006aj is not very sharp , indicating that the nebula is to a good approximation spherically symmetric .",
    "figure 4 shows a comparison of the [ oi ] @xmath146300 , 6363 line of sne 1998bw , 2006aj , and 2003jd . the line in sn2006aj is broader than the other two by @xmath59kms@xmath2 , although the ejecta velicity of sn2006aj was significantly lower than that of sn1998bw .",
    "the line of sn1998bw is quite sharp , which was interpreted as a disk - like distribution of slow - moving oxygen viewed from a near - polar direction @xcite . in sn2003jd",
    "the line has a width similar to that of sn1998bw , but the double - peak profile suggests that we are viewing the oxygen - rich disk from near its plane @xcite .",
    "we modelled the nebular spectra using a non - lte code @xcite based on the approximations discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the deposition of the gamma rays emitted in the decay of @xmath5co  to @xmath5fe  is computed using a gray opacity , while the positrons that are also produced are assumed to deposit their energy _ in situ_. collisional heating by the fast particles produced by the deposition of the gamma rays and the positrons is computed , and is balanced by cooling via line emission .",
    "the emission lines depend on the composition ; in the case of a sn  ic , oxygen dominates the cooling .    for both spectra",
    "the spherical approximation seems reasonable , and so we use the code in its simplest version , assuming that the emitting volume is spherical and homogeneous .",
    "this allows us to test the basic geometric properties of the ejecta of sn2006aj by verifying any deviation of the nebular lines from a parabolic profile .",
    "we adopted a distance of 140mpc and a reddening correction of @xmath60 = 0.13 mag @xcite , which takes into account both galactic and intrinsic absorption .",
    "the main values of the fits are shown in table 1 .",
    "the outer velocity of the model for the keck spectrum is 8000kms@xmath2 , while for the later vlt spectrum this value is 7400kms@xmath2 .",
    "a slight decrease of the outer velocity may be expected as the expansion makes the density decrease with time , such that outer regions may progressively become too thin for collisional excitation processes to work efficiently .",
    "the keck spectrum ( figure 5 ) requires a @xmath5ni  mass of @xmath61 , in excellent agreement with the early light - curve model @xcite , and an oxygen mass of @xmath62 .",
    "uncertainties are estimated from parameter combinations that yield acceptable fits .",
    "the line near 7400  is mostly due to [ niii ] @xmath187380 . given the late epoch of the spectra , stable @xmath63ni  must be responsible for the emission , which can be reproduced assuming a @xmath63ni  mass of @xmath64 .",
    "the consequences of this on the properties of the progenitor star are discussed in an accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "other lines contributing to the emission are [ feii ] @xmath147155 , 7453 and [ coii ] @xmath187541 .",
    "the caii ] @xmath147291 , 7324 lines are very weak .",
    "similarly , the emission near 8600  is mostly due to [ ci ] @xmath188727 , while the caii  ir triplet is very weak .",
    "the line can be reproduced only if we assume the presence of @xmath65 of carbon .",
    "this is an interesting result , as in the early phase no carbon was visible in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the low calcium abundance is also interesting , as it may be a clue of the nucleosynthesis in the progenitor and in the explosion .",
    "the ca / o fraction is @xmath66 by mass , whereas the corresponding value for sn1998bw was @xmath67 .",
    "the total mass enclosed within the outer velocity of 8000kms@xmath2  is @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath5ni  mass estimated for the vlt spectrum is @xmath69 and the oxygen mass is @xmath70 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the total mass enclosed within the outer velocity of 7400kms@xmath2  is @xmath71 .",
    "the slight reduction in ejected mass derived from the later vlt spectrum with respect to the earlier keck spectrum is a consequence of the slightly narrower emission lines , and is consistent with the model used to fit the early light curve and spectra @xcite .",
    "however , while the mass of @xmath5ni  derived from the nebular models ( @xmath72 ) is in excellent agreement with the value estimated from the early light - curve evolution , the ejected mass , and in particular the masses of oxygen and carbon , are larger .",
    "the last early - time spectrum , obtained on 2006 march 10 @xcite , was modelled for a photospheric velocity of 10,000kms@xmath2 , so there is no overlap between the region sampled by the early data ( above 10,000kms@xmath2 ) and that sampled by the nebular spectra ( below 8000kms@xmath2 ) , except that the early light curve depends on the density of the innermost regions .",
    "the ejected mass predicted below 8000kms@xmath2  by the model used by @xcite is @xmath73 , so the nebular results suggest the presence of a dense inner region containing an additional @xmath74 mostly composed of oxygen ( @xmath75 ) and carbon ( @xmath65 ) , signs of which were not visible in the early - time spectra .",
    "the presence of an inner high - density core is typical of other sne  ic ( e.g. , sn 1998bw , sn 2002ap ) , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the only deviation from a parabolic profile may be seen in the core of the [ oi ] line .",
    "this may be due to the assumption of a constant density , or to the presence of an oxygen - dominated high - density inner core .",
    "the profile suggests that the oxygen abundance is dropping at velocities between 2000 and 4000kms@xmath2 , but is higher again at the lowest velocities @xmath76 kms@xmath2 ) . between 2000 and 4000kms@xmath2",
    "intermediate - mass elements may dominate , but the high flux at the lowest velocities may indicate the presence of a disk - like oxygen - rich region .",
    "further data and more detailed modelling will clarify this .",
    "the nebular spectra of sn2006aj are dominated by strong [ oi ] @xmath146300 , 6363 emission , as expected for a sn  ic .",
    "the masses derived from the modelling are small , in general agreement with the values obtained from the early - phase modelling , but indicate the presence of a central low - velocity zone containing @xmath77 of mostly carbon and oxygen .",
    "the abundance of calcium is also very low in the nebula .",
    "the presence of a dense , oxygen - rich core has been deduced from the nebular spectra ( sn1998bw , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or via the analysis of the light curves @xcite in all well - observed broad - lined sne  ic , and it is a strong indication that the explosion was not spherically symmetric .",
    "only if the mass of this zone is large can an effect on the early light curve be appreciated ( e.g. , sn1997ef , * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , in the case of sn2006aj spectroscopic observations in the early phase extended only to 2006 march 10 ( 20 days after the explosion ) , and the evolution of the light curve at epochs of 23 months , when the linear decline is a signature of the inner dense zone @xcite , was missed .",
    "nevertheless , the power of a combined approach of studying both the early phase and the late phase is highlighted by the present results .",
    "the nebular lines have rather symmetric profiles . in particular ,",
    "the [ oi ] line is not as sharp as in sn1998bw , indicating a low degree of asymmetry .",
    "early radio observations suggested that any aspherical outflow was characterized by a large opening angle @xcite , and our results confirm that the ejecta of sn2006aj look more like those of ordinary sne  ic ( e.g. , sn1994i , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than those of sn1998bw .",
    "early - phase modelling suggested that only a small fraction of the @xmath5ni  synthesised by the sn was ejected at high velocities , and our nebular models confirm that most of the @xmath5ni  was ejected at low velocities .",
    "the only possible deviation from sphericity may be in the deepest regions , as indicated by the low - velocity enhancement of the [ oi ] line .",
    "this may indicate an oxygen - rich disk viewed nearly face - on , as in sn1998bw but of much smaller size , confirming that all sne  ic are probably intrinsically aspherical in their cores @xcite .",
    "given the small size of this region , and limited quality of our polarization data , we do not expect that we can detect polarization from that structure . additionally , at the late phases of these data , polarization is more sensitive to the distribution of @xmath5ni  than to global asymmetries of the ejecta .",
    "the lack of a detection of polarization may therefore also indicate that the @xmath5nidistribution in the inner ejecta was not very aspherical .",
    "our results confirm that the mass ejected in the sn explosion was small , and thus lend credence to our earlier conclusion that the progenitor star had a zams mass of @xmath24 , and that probably the remnant was a neutron star ( mazzali et al .",
    "2006b ; see also maeda et al .",
    "they may also shed some light on the magnetar phenomenon .",
    "if the birth of a magnetar was at the origin of the xrf , this magnetic activity did not lead to gross asphericity in the sn ejecta or to the synthesis of much @xmath5ni  at high velocities .",
    "probably , it did not lead to a jet at all , but rather to broad polar outflows .",
    "this should be useful not only for further modelling , but also to understand better the nature of xrfs .",
    "as mentioned by @xcite , xrfs may be intrinsically weaker and more spherical versions of the classical , highly collimated cosmological grbs .",
