    "the discrimination of quantum states  @xcite is one of the fundamental problems in quantum information and a basic task for several applications in communication  @xcite , cryptography  @xcite , fundamental questions  @xcite , measurement and control  @xcite and algorithms  @xcite .",
    "triggered by the observation that non - orthogonal quantum states can not be perfectly discriminated , this subject has stimulated much work , both from a theoretical and practical point of view : the seminal works of helstrom  @xcite , holevo  @xcite and yuen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite formalized the problem , obtaining a set of conditions for the optimal measurement operators , which in turn provide the optimal success probability , then solved it for sets of states symmetric under a unitary transformation ; more recently , acknowledging that a general analytical solution is hard to find , research focused on finding a solution for sets with more general symmetries  @xcite , computing explicitly the optimal measurements for the most interesting sets of states  @xcite and studying the implementation of such measurements with available technology ( see for example  @xcite for the case of two optical coherent states , the most relevant for optical communication ) .",
    "also , the problem of discrimination has been identified as a convex optimization one , arguing that it can be solved efficiently with numerical optimization methods  @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we attempt to solve the optimal discrimination of @xmath0 quantum states from a different perspective , by providing a structured expression for the @xmath0-outcome positive operator valued measure ( povm ) used to discriminate the states .",
    "indeed it can be shown  @xcite that any povm comprising @xmath0 elements is equivalent to a collection of binary povm s , i.e. , comprising two elements , as the one employed in ref .",
    "@xcite : depending on the binary outcome of the first measurement , a second one is applied ; its binary outcome in turn affects the choice of the third binary measurement and so on . in this way",
    "a sequence of nested binary povm s can be constructed , where the povm applied at a given level depends on the string of binary outcomes of the previous ones .",
    "this result was already obtained in ref .",
    "when applied to state discrimination , it acquires a more operational meaning : each binary povm can be seen as discriminating between two subsets of the initial set of states , identified by previous outcomes .",
    "hence the sequence of measurements induces a sequence of discrimination probabilities , so that , if the optimization problem is solved independently for any set of a fixed number of states , the result can be employed in the optimization problem for larger sets of states . + in the second part of the article , employing this decomposition and the two - state optimal probability  @xcite",
    ", we obtain an expression for the success probability of discrimination of any @xmath1 states , depending on a single measurement operator , and solve the problem analytically for specific sets of states .",
    "then we restrict our attention to qubit states and obtain a compact expression which can be easily optimized numerically case by case , at variance with less compact results for @xmath2 presented in previous works based on bloch - space geometry  @xcite .",
    "we recover the results of those works and highlight in particular some interesting lesser - known implications of ref .",
    "+ the article is structured as follows : in sec .  [ deco ] we describe the decomposition in terms of nested binary povm s and provide a proof of its validity , similar to that of ref .  @xcite ; in sec .",
    "[ statedisc ] we apply it to state discrimination and obtain an explicit expression for the case of @xmath1 arbitrary states , then discuss its optimization in some specific cases ; in sec .  [ qubits ] we treat the case of @xmath1 qubit states , computing a compact expression which can be optimized numerically and highlighting some results obtained in this way . eventually in sec .",
    "[ conc ] we draw some conclusions .",
    "detailed computations of the quantities appearing in the article are provided in the appendices .",
    "in this section we prove that any quantum measurement with an arbitrary number of outcomes can be decomposed into a sequence of nested measurements with binary outcomes , where the previous results determine the choice of successive measurements .",
    "we stress that the same result was obtained in ref .  @xcite . at variance with the latter ,",
    "our proof does not make use of the spectral decomposition of the initial measurement operators ; we present it here in a form adapted to the main purpose of the article .",
    "let us suppose we want to perform a quantum measurement with @xmath0 possible outcomes : it can be expressed in general as a povm @xmath3 of elements @xmath4 , one for each outcome @xmath5 , satisfying the positivity and completeness conditions , i.e. , respectively @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the identity operator on the hilbert space of the system to be measured .",
    "this expression can be interpreted as a one - shot measurement with several possible results and its practical realization may often be very hard . on the other hand we could restrict to performing only measurements with two outcomes , as described by _",
    "povm s : @xmath9",
    ". this may be useful when limited technological capabilities or specific theoretical requirements constrain the number of allowed outcomes and the complexity of our measurement .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether this smaller set of resources is sufficient to describe a general quantum measurement .",
    "we answer positively by showing that the more general @xmath0-outcome formalism can be broken up into several binary steps and interpreted as a sequence of nested povm s with two outcomes , trading a _",
    "one - shot _ , _ multiple - outcome _",
    "measurement for a _ multiple - step _ , _ yes - no _ measurement .",
    "+ the nested povm can be expressed in terms of _ conditional binary _",
    "povm s @xmath10 , each complete by itself , to be applied only if a specific string @xmath11 of previous results is obtained .",
    "for example for @xmath12 the nested povm can be realized in two steps and written compactly as the collection of three binary povm s : @xmath13 , properly composed as follows and shown in fig .",
    "[ schema ] .",
    "the measurement starts by applying the first - step binary povm @xmath14 then , depending on its outcome @xmath15 , it selects @xmath16 among the two povm s available in the second - step collection @xmath17 . eventually the chosen second - step povm is applied , receiving an outcome @xmath18 .",
    "the total outcome is a string of two bits , i.e. , @xmath19 , whose value identifies one of four possible outcomes , as desired .",
    "suppose now to apply this measurement on a state @xmath20 of some physical system : if the first - step outcome is @xmath21 , the resulting unnormalized evolved state is @xmath22 ; if then the second - step outcome is @xmath23 , the final unnormalized state of the system is @xmath24 .",
    "this means that the nested povm has a more explicit representation as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the square of the absolute value of an operator @xmath27 .",

    "then we can define a nested povm @xmath38 of order @xmath39 as @xmath40 i.e. , the collection of @xmath41 binary povm s @xmath42 , for all previous outcomes @xmath37 at a given step @xmath35 and all steps @xmath43 .",
    "we can certify that @xmath38 so constructed actually is a povm by checking positivity and completeness of its elements @xmath44 : the former requirement is trivial , while the latter follows from the fact that each binary povm is complete , as shown in appendix  [ appa ] .    in light of the previous discussion we can now state the main theorem :    [ decomposition ] any @xmath0-outcome povm @xmath45 is equivalent to a nested povm @xmath46 , @xmath47 , as in eq .  , composed exclusively of binary povm s @xmath42 , with a total number of steps @xmath48 equal to :    1 .",

    "we start by providing a binary representation of the labels @xmath54 of the initial povm @xmath3 , i.e. , we define @xmath55 , with @xmath56 . in order to prove the theorem we have to show that by combining the elements of the initial @xmath0-outcome povm @xmath3 one can always define a set of binary povm s @xmath42 , for all @xmath57 and @xmath43 , such that : i ) their nested composition is a povm of the form @xmath38 , eq .  ;",

    "being a sum of positive operators , the elements so defined are themselves positive ; moreover their sum equals the sum of all the elements of @xmath3 , implying that they are complete . at the second step",
    "define the elements of the two possible povm s @xmath31 as @xmath60 where the inverse of an operator is to be computed only on its support , while it is equal to @xmath61 on its kernel , i.e. , its pseudo - inverse .",
    "also in this case the defined elements are positive by construction , but they are not complete . indeed it is easy to show , employing the definition , that @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is the projector on the support of the previous outcome operator , @xmath64 , which may have a non - trivial kernel , so that in general it holds @xmath65 .",
    "this problem may be overcome easily by redefining the povm elements as @xmath66 , i.e. , trivially expanding the support of those already defined in , so that @xmath67 .",
    "this operation is trivial because , in the construction of the nested povm , the operators @xmath68 always act after the operator @xmath64 , so that the value of the former outside the support of the latter is completely irrelevant . in other words ,",
    "completeness of the binary povm s is not necessary for the definition of @xmath38 as a proper povm ; it is sufficient to ask for _ weak completeness _ ,",
    "i.e. , that @xmath42 is complete on the support of the operator preceding it in the decomposition , @xmath69 . + generalizing the previous discussion , at the @xmath35-th step we can define the elements of the @xmath70 possible povm s @xmath42 as @xmath71 these elements are positive by construction and they satisfy the weak completeness relation @xmath72 , which is sufficient to define the povm @xmath38 , as discussed in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "hence we are left to show that , when combining the binary elements eq .   as in eq .",

    "+ this completes the proof when @xmath0 is an exact power of @xmath50 .",
    "if this is not the case , it means that @xmath49 is not an integer and it suffices to consider the nested decomposition for the next higher integer , i.e. , set @xmath78 , @xmath47 .",
    "let us then trivially expand the initial @xmath0-outcome povm to a @xmath79-outcome one as @xmath80 by adding @xmath81 null elements .",
