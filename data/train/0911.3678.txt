    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductors ( htscs ) , their engineering applications at liquid nitrogen temperatures have drawn much attention .",
    "the yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) is one of the promising htscs materials for various technical applications .",
    "however , in ceramic materials the critical current density ( @xmath10 ) is , due to the weak link effects , very low , rendering them unsuitable for applications . in order to enhance @xmath10 , the so - called melt - textured growth ( mg ) process",
    "@xcite has been developed , which can significantly enhance @xmath10 .",
    "one interesting phenomenon in the mg htscs is the fishtail effect ( fe ) in @xmath10 as well as in isothermal magnetic hysteresis loops ( @xmath11 curves ) @xcite . as for the fe origin",
    ", some researchers propose the vortex ordered phase to disordered phase transition @xcite to explain this interesting phenomenon , while others attribute it to the bulk pinning @xcite . in the vortex phase transition explanation ,",
    "the fe exists both on a single @xmath12 curve and on a single @xmath13 curve .",
    "however , in the bulk pinning explanation , the fe appears on @xmath11 curves whereas on a single magnetization vs. temperature @xmath14 curve it is seldom reported . in the previous work , the critical state model is used to study the isothermal @xmath11 curves @xcite .",
    "however , for htscs , due to their operation at higher temperatures and due to their small activation energy @xmath15 , the flux creep is significant .",
    "hence , non - linear flux creep models were developed .",
    "meanwhile , the surface barrier @xcite , which prevents vortex entering ( @xmath16 ) and exiting ( @xmath17 ) superconductors , has strong effects on the irreversibility of htscs . in @xcite",
    "pointed out that in the case of a competition between bulk and surface pinning , the initial relaxation is determined by the smaller pinning energy between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus , for example , if @xmath20 then the bulk relaxation should be observed first . in @xcite",
    "it was explained that the pe appears due to both bulk pinning and surface barriers therewith bulk pinning is more important at low temperatures while surface barriers at high temperatures .",
    "the goal of this work was to contribute to the understanding of the fe origin in terms of significant influence of both bulk pinning and surface barriers .",

    "such changes can be induced by the redistribution of pinning centers in the crystal or , in another words , bulk pinning changes during aging .",
    "constancy of the maximum temperature @xmath80 for s1 corresponds to the influence of surface barriers at high temperatures .",
    "the aging effect for sample s2 is not so significant as for s1 .",
    "it is related to the presence of considerable mechanical tensions in the sample ( large value of an additional parameter @xmath811.5  k ) that prevent the redistribution of pinning centers .",
    "larger value of @xmath9 ( for s2 as compared with s1 ) corresponds to the presence of additional pinning centers on silver atoms .",
    "a possible reason of the decrease of @xmath9 and increase of @xmath79 for s1 is the decreasing number of dislocations .",
    "in another words , the crystal s1 becomes more homogeneous after aging @xcite .",
    "in summary , mg ybco samples were investigated by measuring @xmath0-curves . on these curves fe was observed in a wide temperature range .",

    "undoped ybco is characterized by a significant aging effect which is manifested in a considerable change of @xmath9 and @xmath79 .",
    "this corresponds to the change of bulk pinning . for ag - doped ybco",
    "there are no significant changes in parameters @xmath9 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
