    "to understand color confinement mechanism is still an unsolved important problem .",
    "the dual meissner effect is believed to be the mechanism@xcite .",
    "however what causes the dual meissner effect is not clarified .",
    "a possible candidate is magnetic monopoles which appear after projecting @xmath2 qcd to an abelian @xmath3 theory by a partial gauge fixing@xcite .",
    "if such monopoles condense , color confinement could be understood due to the dual meissner effect .",
    "actually an abelian projection adopting a special gauge called maximally abelian gauge ( ma)@xcite leads us to interesting results@xcite which support the idea of monopoles after an abelian projection . see fig.[koma1 ] in which the dual meissner effect due to monopole currents as a solenoidal current is seen beautifully@xcite .",
    "now a natural question arises .",
    "what happens in other general abelian projections or even without any abelian projection ?",
    "for example , consider an abelian projection diagonalizing polyakov loops .",
    "monopoles exist in the continuum limit at a point where eigenvalues of polyakov loops are degenerate@xcite .",
    "but it is easy to show that such a point runs only in the time - like direction .",
    "this means only time - like monopoles which do not contribute to the string tension exist in the abelian projection@xcite .",
    "discuss another simple case of landau gauge .",
    "there vacuum configurations are so smooth and it is easy to check numerically that no monopoles coming from singularities exist . without space - like monopoles or monopoles themselves",
    ", monopole condensation could not occur .",
    "we have to find another confinement mechanism .    in this note",
    ", we show that the dual meissner effect in an abelian sense works good even when monopoles do not exist , performing monte - carlo simulations of quenched @xmath0 qcd with landau gauge fixing . instead of monopoles , time - dependent abelian magnetic fields regarded as magnetic displacement currents are squeezing abelian electric fields .",
    "the dual meissner effect leads us to the dual london equation and the mass generation of the abelian electric fields which suggests the existence of a dimension 2 gluon condensate .",
    "our present numerical results are not perfect , since the continuum limit , the infinite - volume limit and the gauge - independence are not studied yet .",
    "moreover our discussions use abelian components only on the basis of not yet clarified assumption that abelian components are dominant in the infrared qcd ( abelian dominance@xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless authors think the present results are very interesting to general readers , since they show for the first time the abelian dual meissner effect is working in lattice non - abelian qcd without resorting to monopoles coming from a singular gauge transformation@xcite .",
    "the gauge adopted here is the simplest one only to get smooth configurations .",
    "the present results hence suggest the abelian dual meissner effect is the real universal mechanism of color confinement which has been sought for many years .",
    "moreover the relation of the abelian dual meissner effect with the dimension 2 gluon condensate sheds new light on the importance of the gluon condensate @xcite .",
    "detailed studies , a direct proof of abelian dominance and extensions to @xmath2 and full qcd in zero and finite - temperature cases are in progress .",

    "measurements of the string tension make us fix the scale when we use @xmath18mev .",
    "we adopt a coupling constant @xmath19 in which the lattice distance @xmath20 is @xmath21[fm ] .",

    "the lattice size is @xmath22 and after 5000 thermalization , we have prepared 5000 thermalized configurations per each 100 sweeps for measurements .",
    "non - abelian electric and magnetic fields are defined from @xmath23 plaquette @xmath24 as done in ref.@xcite : @xmath25 we also define abelian electric ( @xmath26 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath27 ) similarly using abelian plaquettes @xmath28 defined through link variables @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath29 is given by @xmath31 . in ma",

    "note that electric fields perpendicular to the @xmath36 axis are found to be negligible .",
    "it is very interesting to see from fig.[fig_1 ] that abelian electric field @xmath37 simply defined here is squeezed also .",
    "moreover the squeezing of @xmath37 is stronger than that of non - abelian one @xmath38 . to know how squeezing of the abelian flux occurs seems hence essential .",
    "let us discuss from now on flux distributions of abelian fields alone .",
    "it is checked numerically that there are no degrand - toussaint monopoles@xcite .",

    "the coulombic electric field coming from the static source is written in the lowest perturbation theory in terms of the gradient of a scalar potential .",
    "hence it does not contribute to the curl of the abelian electric field nor to the abelian magnetic field in the above abelian bianchi identity eq.([bi1 ] ) .",
    "the dual meissner effect says that the squeezing of the electric flux occurs due to cancellation of the coulombic electric fields and those from solenoidal magnetic currents . in the case of ma gauge ,",

    "let us see also the detailed distributions shown in fig.[curl ] .",

    ", @xmath52 is non - vanishing , although it is also suppressed in comparison with @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is almost zero .",
    "the authors think that non - vanishing of the radial and @xmath55 components of @xmath56 in landau gauge and @xmath47 in ma gauge is due to lattice artifacts and also due to the smallness of the wilson loop size adopted here .",
    "it is interesting that the shapes of @xmath51 in landau gauge and @xmath53 in ma gauge look similar , although the strengths are different .",
    "they have a peak at almost the same distance around @xmath57[fm ] and almost vanish around @xmath58[fm ] .",
    "the reader may wonder if the above consideration of the abelian fields alone is enough .",

    "our results are as follows : @xmath59 this is compared with the result obtained using wilson gauge action in ref.@xcite : @xmath60 hence substantial improvement is obtained with the use of iwasaki impoved action .",
    "this suggests the abelian monopole part could reproduce the full string tension in the continuum limit .",
    "abelian dominance in infrared qcd is also checked in some works with the use of controlled cooling .",

    "it is almost equal to the penetration length determined by abelian wilson loop and abelian electric fields in ma gauge .",
    "see fig.[cea ] taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 ( in units of @xmath67 ) versus @xmath64 for square wilson loops .",

    "let us , briefly , illustrate our cooling procedure .",
    "the lattice gauge configurations are cooled by replacing the matrix @xmath72 associated to each link @xmath73 with a new matrix @xmath74 in such a way that the local contribution to the lattice action @xmath75 is minimized .",
    "@xmath76 is the sum over the `` u - staples '' involving the link @xmath77 and @xmath78 , so that @xmath79  su(2 ) . in",
    "a `` controlled '' or `` smooth '' cooling step we have @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the su(2 ) matrix which maximizes @xmath82 subjected to the following constraint on the su(2 ) distance between @xmath72 and @xmath83 : @xmath84 \\ ; \\le \\delta^2 \\,.\\ ] ] we adopt @xmath85 . a complete cooling sweep consists in the replacement eq .   at each lattice site .",
    "we find the profile of the non - abelian electric field @xmath86 tends to that of the abelian one of @xmath87 in the long - range region as shown in fig.[fig_5 ] .",
    "this is consistent with the above result@xcite in a different approach .",
    "profiles of non - abelian electric field @xmath88 after cooling .",
    "@xmath87 stands for the abelian electric field .",
    "@xmath6 is used.,width=321,height=226 ]",
    "now we have shown that the magnetic displacement currents are important in the dual meissner effect when there are no monopoles .",
    "then how can we understand the origin of the dual meissner effect without monopoles ?",
    "the abelian dual meissner effect indicates the massiveness of the abelian electric field as an asymptotic field : @xmath89 this leads us to a dual london equation which is a key to the dual meissner effect .",
    "let us evaluate the curl of the magnetic displacement current . using eq.([bi1 ] ) , we get @xmath90 from eq.([eqm - abel ] ) , we get the dual london equation : @xmath91    let us remember a simple mean - field approach developed by fukuda@xcite . neglecting gauge - fixing and fadeev - popov terms , we have equations of motion @xmath92 and the ( non - abelian ) bianchi identity @xmath93 .",
    "applying @xmath94 operator to the bianchi identity and using the jacobi identity and the equations of motion , we get @xmath95 notice @xmath96 . hence if @xmath97 , we see asymptotically that the electric fields become massive @xmath98 with @xmath99@xcite . now",
    "the abelian electric field is also massive asymptotically @xmath100 .",
    "hence the dual london equation ( [ london2 ] ) is obtained .",
    "the importance of the dimension 2 gluon condensate has been stressed by zakharov and his collaborators@xcite and refs.@xcite .",
    "recent discussions on the value of the gluon condensate are seen in ref.@xcite .",
    "some of them discuss the mass generation of the gluon propagator .",
    "but as pointed out by fukuda@xcite , the non - vanishing dimension 2 gluon condensate leads us to a conclusion that field strengths @xmath101 instead of gluon fields @xmath102 become good canonical variables having a finite mass , whereas gluon propagators have a @xmath103 behavior showing confinement .",
    "although the operator of the gluon condensate is gauge - variant , it is proved recently the expectation value is gauge invariant@xcite .",
    "hence the gluon condensate has a physical importance , if the proof is correct .",
    "the numerical simulations of this work were done using rscc computer clusters in riken .",
