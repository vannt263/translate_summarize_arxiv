    "ever since being proposed by pauli , neutrinos have been a sort of fascinating puzzle for the physicists .",
    "the recent observation of non zero leptonic mixing angle @xmath0 @xcite-@xcite has provided significant boost to the sharpening of implications of the neutrino oscillations and has added another dimension to neutrino physics by implying the possibility of cp violation in the leptonic sector , hence deepening the flavor puzzle further .",
    "the non zero value of @xmath0 , on the one hand , restores the parallelism between the mixings of quarks and leptons , on the other hand , its unexpectedly ` large ' value signifies the differences between these , the leptonic mixing angles being large as compared to the quark counterparts .    in the absence of any viable theory of flavor dynamics for explaining the fermion masses and mixings",
    ", approaches followed on the theoretical front can broadly be catagorized into ` top - down ' and ` bottom - up ' . despite large number of attempts using the ` top - down ' perspective @xcite , we have yet to arrive at a viable approach which accounts for the vast amount of data related to flavor mixings .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we follow the ` bottom - up ' approach consisting of finding the phenomenological fermion mass matrices which are in tune with the latest low energy data . in this context , texture",
    "specific mass matrices have got a good deal of attention @xcite and play an important role in explaining the flavor mixing phenomena . in particular , texture",
    "specific mass matrices provide valuable information to explain the quark and lepton masses and mixings , for details we refer the reader to @xcite . in the context of leptons",
    ", it needs to be mentioned that with the texture approach , minimal textures for dirac neutrinos have recently @xcite been ruled out , however , a detailed and comprehensive analysis for the non - minimal textures in light of the recent measurement of @xmath0 is yet to be carried out .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to carry out a systematic and comprehensive study of non - minimal lepton mass matrices using the texture zero approach . in the context of neutrinos ,",
    "the issue of these being dirac like or majorana particles is still an open question for the physicists since the dirac neutrinos have not yet been ruled by experimental data . in the present work ,",
    "considering the neutrinos to be dirac like particles , we have made an attempt to examine the compatibility of non - minimal lepton mass matrix textures with the recent neutrino mixing data for all the three neutrino mass hierarchies i.e. normal , inverted and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses .",
    "it may be noted that while carrying out the analysis , we consider the charged lepton mass matrices and the effective neutrino mass matrices having parallel structures i.e. texture zeroes being located at identical positions , in consonance with some classes of family symmetries and grand unified theories @xcite wherein such parallel structures emerge naturally .",
    "the detailed plan of the paper is as follows . in section ( 2 )",
    "we discuss the general lepton mass matrices in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "inputs used in the analysis are given in section ( 3 ) .",
    "results and discussion pertaining to normal hierarchy , inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses for texture 2 zero , texture 4 zero and texture 5 zero lepton mass matrices are presented in section ( 4 ) .",
    "finally , section ( 5 ) summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite-@xcite of particle physics , the lepton mass matrices are arbitrary @xmath1 complex matrices , thus containing a total of 36 real parameters . using the ` polar decomposition theorem ' ,",
    "the lepton mass matrices in sm can be considered to be hermitian without any loss of generality bringing down the number of free parameters from 36 to 18 . to facilitate the formulation of phenomenological mass matrices , which perhaps are compatible with the gut scale mass matrices , it has been suggested @xcite that in order to avoid fine tuning amongst the elements of the mass matrices",
    ", these should follow a ` natural hierarchy ' i.e. @xmath2 .",
    "the number of free parameters in these mass matrices can further be reduced using the facility of weak basis ( wb ) transformations .",
    "these wb approaches broadly lead to two possibilities for the texture zero lepton mass matrices . in the first possibility observed by branco _",
    "@xcite , one ends up with a structure wherein one of the matrices is a texture two zero type and the other is a one zero type , i.e. ( m_l)_(1,1)=(m_l)_(1,3)=(m_l)_(3,1)=(m_d)_(1,1)=0 , + or  ( m_l)_(1,1)=(m_d)_(1,1)=(m_d)_(1,3)=(m_d)_(3,1)=0 , [ branc]@xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to the charged lepton and the dirac neutrino mass matrix respectively . in the second possibility , given by fritzsch and xing @xcite ,",
    "one ends up with a texture two zero structure for the lepton mass matrices , wherein both the lepton mass matrices assume a texture one zero structure , viz .",
    ", ( m_l)_(1,3)=(m_l)_(3,1)=(m_d)_(1,3)=(m_d)_(3,1)=0 .",
    "[ branc ] although the two possibilities are equivalent , however for the present work we have followed the fritzsch - xing approach , this choice can be justified as the mass matrices obtained by fritzsch - xing approach not only exhibit parallel texture structures but can also be diagonalized exactly making the construction of the corresponding lepton mixing matrix easier .",
    "therefore , the general lepton mass matrices within the framework of sm can be given as m_l= ( c_l & a _ l & 0 + a_l^ * & d_l & b_l + 0 & b_l^ * & e_l ) , m_d= ( c _ & a _ & 0 + a_^ * & d _ & b _ + 0 & b_^ * & e _ ) , [ t20]with @xmath5 .    following the methodology connecting the lepton mass matrices to the mixing matrix detailed in @xcite , one can carry out diagonalization of a general mass matrix @xmath6 by expressing it as m_k = q_k m_k^r p_k , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are diagonal phase matrices given as diag@xmath9 and diag @xmath10 respectively and @xmath11 is a real symmetric matrix .",
    "@xmath11 can be diagonalized by an orthogonal transformation @xmath12 , e.g. , m_k^diag = o_k^t m_k^r o_k which can be rewritten as m_k^diag = o_k^t q_k^m_k p_k^o_k .",
    "the elements of the general diagonalizing transformation can figure with different phase possibilities , however , these possibilities are related to each other through the phase matrices @xcite .",

    "for instance , first element of @xmath29 can be given as o_d(11)=.    similarly , one can obtain the elements of diagonalizing transformation for the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) case defined as @xmath35 and the corresponding degenerate case given by @xmath36 by replacing @xmath22 , -@xmath23 , @xmath24 with @xmath37 , -@xmath38 , -@xmath34 in eqn .",

    "the lepton mixing matrix , the ` pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) ' matrix @xcite can be obtained from these orthogonal transformations using the relation u = o_l^q_l p_d o_d , where @xmath39 can be taken as diag(@xmath40 , 1 , @xmath41 ) .",

    "for all the three possible mass hierarchies of neutrinos i.e. normal , inverted and degenerate scenario , the explored range of the lightest neutrino mass is taken to be @xmath59 , our conclusions remain unaffected even if the range is extended further . in the absence of any constraint on the phases , @xmath42 and @xmath43 have been given full variation from 0 to @xmath60 .",
    "although @xmath61 and @xmath62 are free parameters , however , they have been constrained such that diagonalizing transformations @xmath25 and @xmath63 always remain real .",
    "before discussing the results , we would like to briefly discuss the possible non - minimal textures which we plan to analyse and discuss . while considering such possibilities , we ignore wb related mass matrix structures , in particular those related through permutations , as in the case of parallel textures these are equivalent . in the case of texture two zero",

    "texture five zero mass matrices can easily be derived from the corresponding texture four zero ones .      to examine the compatibility of texture two zero lepton mass matrices given in equation ( [ t20 ] ) with the recent mixing data , we carry out a detailed analysis pertaining to all three possible neutrino mass hierarchies . to this end , in figure ( [ t2ih1 ] ) we present the plots showing the parameter space of two mixing angles , with the third one being constrained by its @xmath64 experimental bounds for inverted hierarchy .",
    "the rectangular boxes in these figures show the @xmath49 ranges for the two mixing angles being considered in the figure .",
    "as is evident from these figures , the parameter space for the mixing angles shows considerable overlap with the experimentally allowed @xmath49 region .",
    "therefore , inverted hierarchy seems to be viable for texture two zero lepton mass matrices given in equation ( [ t20 ] ) .",
    "cc    after discussing the viability of inverted hierarchy for texture two zero mass matrices , we now examine the compatibility of these matrices for the normal hierarchy case . to this end , in figure ( [ t2nh1 ] ) we present the plots showing the parameter space allowed for two mixing angles when the third one is constrained by its @xmath64 experimental bound for normal neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "a general look at the figure ( [ t2nh1 ] ) reveals that the structure given in eqn.([t20 ] ) is compatible with the normal neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "cc    further , in figures ( [ t2nh2 ] ) and ( [ t2nh3 ] ) we present the graphs showing variation of the mixing angles with the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively for structure ( [ t20 ] ) pertaining to normal hierarchy of neutrino masses . while plotting these figures , all the three mixing angles have been constrained by their @xmath67 experimental bounds , while all the free parameters have been given full variation .",
    "taking a careful look at these plots it is interesting to note that the leptonic mixing angles donot have much dependence on the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "further one can see that a fit for all the three mixing angles can be obtained for the values of parameters being @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "figure ( [ t2ih2 ] ) clearly shows that in order to accomodate the latest @xmath49 ranges for the mixing parameters , one requires @xmath65 and @xmath73 @xmath74 1 .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that very small values of the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 are required to fit the latest experimental data for the structure ( [ t20 ] ) corresponding to both normal as well as inverted neutrino mass orderings and the structure ( [ t20 ] ) thus essentially reduces to m_l= ( 0 & a _ l & 0 + a_l^ * & d_l & b_l + 0 & b_l^ * & e_l ) , m_d= ( 0 & a _ & 0 + a_^ * & d _ & b _ + 0 & b_^ * & e _ ) [ flt40]the structure ( [ flt40 ] ) is referred to as fritzsch - like texture four zero structure and is studied extensively in literature @xcite .",

    "indeed , they can be related by a wb transformation , performed by a permutation matrix p , m_l^= p^t m_l p + m_^= p^t m _",
