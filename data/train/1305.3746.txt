    "the synergy of experimental achievements and first principles atomistic modeling was especially fruitful in this field .",
    "key to a correct interpretation of conduction measurements in break junctions or scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) is for example the precise knowledge of the molecular geometry within the junction .",
    "this information can nowadays be obtained from density functional theory ( dft ) in a routine fashion . besides structural data , dft may also be used to estimate i - v characteristics in conjunction with the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite .    with the enormous chemical diversity of even small to medium sized molecules , the initial hope was to choose appropriate compounds for a given desired circuit element and fine - tune their electronic structure by suitable functionalization .",
    "while this approach met practical problems @xcite , several groups are now investigating the possibility of using time - dependent fields to gain additional control over the conduction process @xcite .",
    "as an example , application of visible and uv light induces a reversible ring - opening / ring - closure reaction in some organic molecules that leads to sizable on / off ratios of the current @xcite .",
    "light emission from molecular junctions may also provide further means to characterize the device @xcite .",
    "in many of these experiments , the frequency of the the applied radiation is small compared to the plasmon frequency of the metallic leads .",
    "one can then assume that the effect of the time - dependent field is just a rigid shift of the contact energy levels , leading to a sinusoidal bias potential across the junction .",
    "the resulting picture of _ ac _ conduction raises a couple of interesting questions in the context of molecular electronics .",
    "do conventional organic molecules behave as classical capacitors or inductors , or does their _ ac _ response depend on frequency and chemistry in a non - trivial way ?",
    "this question was already addressed by fu and dudley in the 1990s for the model system of a resonant tunneling diode @xcite , and recently , several groups presented dft based calculations of _ ac _ conductances for realistic molecular junctions @xcite .",
    "the time - dependence of the voltage has also other measurable consequences : if the i - v characteristic of a device is non - linear , the fourier transform of the time - dependent current will feature peaks at multiples of the driving frequency @xmath0 .",
    "these higher harmonics were utilized in stm to characterize also non - conducting samples @xcite . with the currently available instrumentation ,",
    "harmonics at optical frequencies are clearly difficult to detect",
    ". however , the generation of higher harmonics implies current rectification ( the change of _ dc _ current due to an additional _ ac _ bias ) and is therefore indirectly accessible . in recent experiments the measured non - linearities and",
    "the rectified current were used to estimate the field enhancement in metallic nanoconstrictions subjected to visible light @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the modeling of photocurrents was pioneered by tien and gordon @xcite , while cuevas and coworkers presented a number of detailed dft based calculations on this topic in recent years @xcite .",
    "a direct estimation of the amplitude and number of higher harmonics in realistic molecular junctions seems to be missing . in principle , green s function approaches in the energy domain can be utilized for this purpose , but require truncations in the number of photons absorbed and emitted in the tunneling process @xcite .    in this article",
    "we apply an approximate method based on time - dependent density functional theory to investigate the _ ac _ response of several realistic molecular devices .",
    "the density matrix of the device is propagated according to a liouville - van neumann equation including the effects of dissipation and decoherence due to the macroscopic leads .",
    "the latter are characterized by an embedding self - energy in the wide - band approximation . at each time",
    "step the potential in the device region is determined by solving the poisson equation and used to update the time - dependent dft hamiltonian in a selfconsistent fashion .",
    "the method allows one to compute the time - dependent current @xmath1 for arbitrary time - dependent bias potentials . after a short description of the numerical scheme in sec .",
    "[ theo ] , we investigate the frequency dependent admittance @xmath2 for a typical molecular junction in sec .",
    "the remainder of the paper ( sec .",

    "the goal is here to contrast the results from a fully quantum - mechanical calculation with classical estimates .",
    "+    the following will outline the approach leading to the presented results .",
    "apart from the hamiltonian entering the scheme , we follow the method introduced by zheng and co - workers @xcite .",
    "our systems are partitioned into a central device region ( d ) - which also includes two layers of contact material - and semi - infinite periodic leads on either side of the device ( l , r ) .",
    "the leads are identical and the whole device is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium ( @xmath3 k ) at a common chemical potential for @xmath4 . in consequence ,",
    "current only flows due to an applied time - dependent bias @xmath5 of arbitrary shape and magnitude .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , we employ a propagation scheme based on the liouville - van neumann equation for the kohn - sham density matrix . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , a closed equation for the reduced density matrix of the device region may be derived , featuring dissipation terms @xmath6 arising from the interaction with the semi - infinite leads ( in atomic units ) :    @xmath7 -i \\sum_{\\alpha = l , r } q_\\alpha(t).\\ ] ]    here , @xmath8 is the reduced kohn - sham density matrix written in a basis of localized atom - centered basis functions @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 have been derived in the framework of quantum dissipation theory using the keldysh non - equilibrium green s function formalism .",
    "it is possible to write down a formally exact and explicit expression for the dissipation terms using hierarchical equations of motions @xcite applicable to arbitrary non - markovian dissipative systems .",
    "however , we aim for numerical efficiency and use the markovian approximation to @xmath10 proposed in the original article @xcite within the wide band limit ( wbl ) :    @xmath11+\\{\\gamma_{\\alpha},\\sigma(t)\\}+k_{\\alpha}(t),\\label{wblq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 denotes the real part of the self - energy and @xmath13 its imaginary part . the self - energy itself is calculated from the device - lead couplings and the surface green s function of the leads .",

    "the initial density matrix is obtained from equilibrium green s function theory using the same input hamiltonian and the wide band limit for consistency .",

    ", it is numerically extremely expensive to extract information about the admittance behaviour for such demanding systems by use of td - dft .",
    "consequently , we employ the above propagation scheme in conjunction with an approximate form of td - dft , namely time dependent density functional based tight - binding ( td - dftb ) @xcite in addition to the wbl already mentioned . + the hamiltonian matrix then takes the following form :    @xmath16|\\phi_\\nu \\rangle \\\\\\nonumber & + & \\frac{1}{2}[\\delta v_a(t)+\\delta v_b(t)]s_{\\mu\\nu},\\quad \\mu\\in a , \\nu \\in b.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eq .",

    "since the evaluation of this term only requires information about the distance between atoms , it can be built from pre - calculated lookup tables almost instantaneously .",
    "the second term accounts for deviations from the reference density . at each time step , the charge density in the device region is computed from the density matrix @xmath20 and the basis function overlap @xmath21 .",

    "generally , a broader peak in the transmission also leads to a significantly greater effect on the shape of the admittance , especially its real part .",
    "resonances at energies far from @xmath30 contribute less to the admittance .",
    "consequently , one expects to be able to relate the profile of the admittance to broad features in the _ dc _ transmission , at least close to the fermi energy .",

    "since @xmath62 represents the _ dc _ component of the _ ac _ current , or in other words its time averaged value , we can also easily access the rectified current from the fourier transform .",

    "another difference between the two approaches is that the quasi - static @xmath64 falls off much stronger inbetween the harmonics .",
