    "the observation of fluctuation - driven critical phenomena in structural phase transitions is subject of long and persistent controversies .",
    "although power law behaviours near phase transitions can be `` universal '' , the temperature range where this asymptotic behaviour can be observed within experimental resolution ( the so - called asymptotic or critical region ) is not .",
    "it depends in general on the particular features of each system and can even vary for different physical quantities .",
    "it is no wonder , therefore , that the size of the critical region in structural phase transitions has been a matter of discussion for several decades . in general",
    ", one should expect it to be smaller than in the pure order - disorder systems , the spin hamiltonians , that represent the corresponding universality classes .",
    "however , the ginzburg criterion has been equally invoked to predict typical critical regions of size too small to be of any experimental significance,@xcite as to justify critical regions of the order of 0.1 in reduced temperature ( @xmath11)@xcite ( an interval that would greatly surpass that of the actual spin - hamiltonian representatives of some of the universality classes ) .",
    "in addition , structural defects may produce strong deviations from the universal asymptotic laws predicted for ideally perfect crystals.@xcite    authors expecting insignificantly small critical regions have argued repeatedly that the experimental observation of power laws around the phase transition with non - mean - field exponents may have a rather simple explanation , e.g. in terms of the landau theory when sixth - order or higher order terms are taken into account in the landau expansion@xcite . for instance , a 2 - 4 - 6 landau potential :    @xmath12    with temperature independent parameters @xmath13 and @xmath1 yields indeed a mean field critical behaviour for the order parameter ( @xmath14 ) with a mean - field exponent @xmath15 , but the asymptotic behaviour is limited to @xmath16 .",
    "this temperature interval can be beyond any observation if the fourth order coefficient is small enough , a typical situation happening if the system is close to a tricritical point . in @xmath17-intervals of the order of 0.01 - 0.1 , or even larger , the behaviour of the order parameter",
    "can then be fitted to power laws with `` effective '' exponents which are intermediate between the mean field value 1/2 and the one corresponding to mean field tricritical behaviour ( 1/4 ) .    more generally , it became clear that any experimental observation of expected asymptotic critical behaviour for the order parameter requires further confirmation through cross - examination of its consistency with the behaviour of other physical parameters near the transition point .",
    "the correlation of the order parameter with the transition excess entropy has been recently used for this purpose@xcite .",
    "the excess entropy @xmath2 is expected to be proportional to the square of the order parameter @xmath3 not only in the mean field asymptotic regime ( @xmath18 ) , but also for any behaviour described by a landau potential like  equation  ( [ eq : landaupot ] ) .",
    "the relation would be true as long as the terms higher than quadratic in the landau potential are temperature independent and the quadratic term has a linear temperature dependence .",
    "this particular relation between entropy and order parameter is in principle broken in the asymptotic regime for all other universality classes .",
    "its experimental check can be then an effective way to distinguish between genuine fluctuation - driven critical behaviour and pure landau behaviour .",
    "indeed , this proportionality relation has recently been shown for sto@xmath10 , in contradiction with a common belief that this compound exhibits in a significant temperature interval asymptotic critical behaviour corresponding to the heisenberg3d  or the ising3d  universality class@xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xmath2 , instead of checking directly the expected critical behaviour of the excess specific heat @xmath4 , has the fundamental advantage of using an integrated quantity with a smooth temperature dependence that is independent of experimental statistical errors in the measurement of @xmath4 .    in the present paper ,",
    "the approach of comparing @xmath2 and @xmath19 for analysing the thermal behaviour at phase transitions is further investigated and applied to several materials .",
    "the expected behaviour of @xmath0 for the different universality classes and the landau case , is discussed and compared with that derived from experimental data for r@xmath8cf@xmath9 ( antiferromagnetic phase transition ) , r@xmath8zc@xmath9 ( normal - incommensurate phase transition ) and sto@xmath10 ( antiferrodistortive transition ) .",
    "the asymptotic entropy - order parameter relation for the different universality classes follows from the critical laws for specific heat and order parameter .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22    in order to get these expressions the normal asymptotic behaviour of the order parameter , characterized by the exponent @xmath23 , is assumed while that of the excess specific heat is supposed to be : @xmath24          the curve of r@xmath8zc@xmath9 in figure  [ fig : rzcb ] strongly deviates from its low @xmath17 linear behaviour for @xmath27 and changes then rapidly into a near horizontal straight line .",
    "this suggests a crossover around this temperature from the xy3d  critical behaviour to a mean - field / landau regime .",
    "however , this interpretation would be somehow in contradiction with the fact that the observed order parameter behaviour , used in fact for the calculation of this curve , does not suffer any kind of crossover at @xmath28 and follows the @xmath23 power law with excellent agreement up to much larger @xmath17 values , of the order of 0.1 . in any case",
    ", the curve clearly deviates for @xmath29 from the theoretical curve for the xy3d  class in figure  [ fig : teordsqdb ] and this can then only be caused by the deviation beyond this @xmath17 value of the experimental @xmath4 from the theoretical asymptotic behaviour given by equation  ( [ eq : assum ] ) and used to produce figure  [ fig : teordsqdb ] .",
    "the reason for such deviation could be intrinsic , i.e. the critical region for the specific heat would be then of the order 0.01 , while for the order parameter is about 0.1 in reduced temperature , but it is also possible that the critical region were sample dependent . in order to get a more comprehensive analysis of this phase transition",
    "we have also analyzed the measurement done by haga _",
    "et al._@xcite where the excess specific heat was fitted over @xmath30 , i.e. 0.1 in reduced temperature , using a complex expression involving corrections up to second order of the pure asymptotic regime :      where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; where @xmath35 are expresed in arbitrary units .",
    "this curve is compared in figure  [ fig : hagakill ] with that obtained from a mere critical law as given in equation  ( [ eq : assum ] ) , which essentially corresponds to the neglect of the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 in equation  ( [ eq : hagafit ] ) .",
    "the difference between both curves become obvious beyond @xmath38 , showing that for lower temperatures corrections to the asymptotic behaviour are significant . for comparison ,",
    "we have computed again the curve of @xmath0 using as specific heat data the values given by the function equation  ( [ eq : hagafit ] ) as proposed by haga .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : hagaour ] .",
    "in arbitrary units for r@xmath8zc@xmath9 .",
    "we present the results for our specific heat data compared with those obtained using instead data of haga _ et al._@xcite as given by equation  ( [ eq : hagafit ] ) . ]",
    "the agreement between both calculations is excellent .",
    "the approximate linear behaviour for @xmath17 values smaller than 0.01 is reproduced and its slope gives a value of around 0.15 similar to that obtained from our specific heat analysis .",
    "on the other hand , a small shift along the @xmath17-axis of the crossover region can be observed and the behaviour for larger @xmath17 values slightly differs .",
    "these differences are most probably due to the choice of the baseline for obtaining the `` excess '' specific heat .",
    "the influence of the baseline is slight at small values of @xmath17 but becomes very important when @xmath17 increases .",
    "the results presented for r@xmath8zc@xmath9 in figure  [ fig : rzcb ] correspond to a baseline described by a polynomial of minimal order fitting the specific data well above and below the phase transition .",
    "this polynomial can be significantly changed , by shifting the low - temperature fitting region to higher o lower temperatures , while keeping a physically consistent baseline .",
    "the effect of this change of baseline is shown in figure  [ fig : shifting ] .",
    "it is slight for low @xmath17 values , where the approximate linear behaviour remains unchanged , while the crossover to what one might consider a landau regime ( the horizontal part of the curve in figure  [ fig : rzcb ] ) becomes less pronounced . as shown in the figure , the change is such that the calculated curve coincides with the theoretical one of the xy-3d class in a much larger @xmath17 interval . hence , a large uncertainty exists with respect to the actual @xmath17-interval where a crossover to the landau behaviour does take place .",
    "but , the behaviour of the @xmath39 relationship for @xmath40 confirming a xy-3d critical regime is robust with respect to modifications of the baseline ."
