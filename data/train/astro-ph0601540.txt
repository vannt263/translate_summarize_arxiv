    "astrophysical black holes are very simple objects , completely characterized by their mass and spin .",
    "mass can be measured using newtonian mechanics by studying objects orbiting the black hole . for the galactic black holes",
    "this is the companion star of the binary system , while for the supermassive black holes in galaxy nuclei this can be traced by nearby stars or gas in orbit around it .",
    "however , unlike mass , spin does not leave a discernable mark on the external spacetime at large distances .",
    "it only makes a significant difference close to the event horizon , so it is much more difficult to measure .",
    "since the spin of a black hole is generally not well known it becomes an obvious parameter to use to ` explain ' any unusual behaviour .",
    "jet production is a case in point .",
    "about 10 per cent of quasars are known to be radio loud , while the rest are radio quiet .",
    "similarly , some of the galactic black hole binaries are also known to produce relativistic jets ( e.g. fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) .",
    "there is persistent speculation in the literature that jet production is linked to the spin of the black hole ( e.g. moderski , sikora & lasota 1998 ) .",
    "theoretically , this could be due to direct tapping of the spin energy of the black hole via the blandford - znajek effect ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "these ideas can only be directly tested by measuring the spin , so it becomes an important property to constrain .",
    "the most obvious consequence of black hole spin is that it drags the last stable orbit inwards , from 6@xmath3 ( where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the black hole mass ) for a non - rotating black hole to 1.23@xmath3 for a maximal spin of @xmath6 = 0.998 , where dimensionless spin parameter @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the black hole angular momentum .",
    "thus for the same mass accretion rate through a disc , a spinning black hole has a higher disc luminosity and temperature .",
    "equivalently , in terms of direct observables , a spinning black hole of the same luminosity has a higher disc temperature .",
    "however , using this to measure black hole spin is not entirely straightforward as black hole spectra are generally complex .",
    "the accretion disc spectrum is always accompanied by a tail of emission to much higher energies .",
    "while the origin of this tail is not well understood , it clearly points to some fraction of the energy being dissipated outside of the optically thick disc material , so that it does not thermalize .",
    "the tail can have a large impact on the derived disc luminosity and temperature if it carries a large fraction of the bolometric luminosity ( see e.g. kubota & done 2004 ) , so disc radii derived from these spectra are highly model dependent .",
    "conversely , where the tail is not energetically important the disc spectrum can be reliably determined , and direct fitting of such disc dominated spectra can give an estimate for the black hole spin ( e.g. ebisawa et al .",
    "1991 ; gierliski , macioek - niedwiecki & ebisawa 2001 ) . however , a further problem is that the disc spectrum is not a simple sum of blackbody spectra from different radii .",
    "distortions from compton scattering from within the disc itself are probably important ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; shimura & takahara 1995 ; merloni et al . 2000 ; davis et al . 2005 ) , making this method dependant on the assumed vertical disc structure .",
    "a variant on this method is to use a sequence of disc dominated spectra from a given source , at different luminosities .",
    "a constant radius disc at different mass accretion rate should have luminosity , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the maximum temperature .",
    "the proportionality constant gives a measure of the disc area , and hence radius , modulo uncertainties in the spectral distortions introduced by compton scattering in the disc itself .",
    "the advantage of this method is that observationally many sources show @xmath9 , giving confidence in a well defined , constant inner disc radius to associate with the last stable orbit ( ebisawa et al .",
    "1991 , 1993 ; kubota et al .",
    "2001 ; kubota & makashima 2004 ; kubota & done 2004 ; gierliski & done 2004 ) , and for an approximately constant colour temperature correction for the spectral distortions ( shafee et al .",
    "2006 ; davis , done & blaes 2006 ) .    here",
    "we apply this method to grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "this is the obvious source to use to investigate links between black hole spin and jet behaviour as it was the first galactic source to show a superluminal radio jet ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ) .",
    "several more superluminal jet sources have since been found ( gro j165540 , xte j1748288 , v4641 sgr ) , while a much larger number of black holes ( together termed the microquasars ) show jet - like radio morphology ( e.g. mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ) .",
    "mildly relativistic jets are now recognized as a common feature of black holes at low mass accretion rates , while strong radio flaring is probably associated with state changes ( e.g. fender , belloni & gallo 2004 )",
    ".    however , grs  1915 + 105 is also the most spectacularly variable accreting black hole in our galaxy , showing episodes where it continually switches between states in a quasi  regular way ( see e.g. the review by fender & belloni 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 1997a ) showed that this variability could be associated with the accretion disc spectrum switching from hot and bright , implying a small inner disc radius , to cooler and dimmer , with a larger inferred radius .",
    "they interpreted this as the result of a limit - cycle instability in the inner accretion disc , such that it is continually emptying and refilling .",
    "whatever its origin , this variability complicates the spectral analysis , as does the high absorbing column density towards this source .",
    "nonetheless , by going to the highest resolution spectra ( 16 s ) we are able to find disc dominated spectra , and these show an approximate @xmath9 relation ( see also muno et al .",
    "we fit these spectra simultaneously with the best currently available theoretical accretion disc models ( davis et al . 2005 ) and find @xmath11 for a distance of 12.5  kpc .",
    "there are considerable uncertainties on the system parameters , but this spin is consistent with the moderate spins found from other , better constrained , gbh jet systems ( davis et al .",
    "we show this is also consistent with the most recent numerical mhd simulations of the accretion flow , which show that moderate spin black holes can produce powerful jets ( hawley & krolik 2006 ; mckinney 2005 ) .",
    "we use xspec version 11.3 for spectral fitting .",
    "the main component of our model is emission from the optically thick accretion disc . for data selection ( section [ sec : data_selection ] ) and for some of the spectral modelling ( section [ sec : diskbb ] ) we use a multicolour disc blackbody , diskkbb ( mitsuda et al .",
    "we also use more advanced model taking into account the spectral distortions from comptonization in the disc and relativistic corrections in section [ sec : bhspec ] .",
    "the disc photons are comptonized in optically thin plasma , for which we use thermal comptonization model thcomp ( zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz 1996 ; ycki , done & smith 1999 ) .",
    "we also include a gaussian ( with energy constrained to be between 67  kev and @xmath12 fixed at 0.5  kev ) and smeared edge ( ebisawa et al . 1991 ) to approximately describe the reflected emission .",
    "the galactic absorption is modelled as in done et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , i.e. with variable abundance cold gas varabs with abundances from anders & ebihara ( 1982 ) and fixed column of @xmath13 @xmath14 in all elements apart from si and fe , which had equivalent h column ( assuming ism abundances ) of @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath14 , respectively , as determined from the _ chandra _ transmission grating results of lee et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "we assume the black hole mass of 14 m@xmath17 ( harlaftis & greiner 2004 ) , the disc inclination of 66@xmath18 ( fender et al .",
    "1999 ) and the distance to the source of 12.5 kpc ( rodrguez & mirabel 1999 ) , unless stated otherwise .",
    "the derived disc temperature and luminosity are strongly model - dependent where the x - ray tail constitutes more than @xmath1920 per cent of the total bolometric power ( e.g. kubota & done 2004 ) .",
    "hence it is very important to select only disc - dominated spectra to determine the black hole spin .",
    "we aim to chose only the spectra with less then 15 per cent contribution from comptonization to the bolometric flux .",
    "another issue with data selection is the rapid variability seen in grs  1915 + 105 , where the spectrum switches rapidly between states with strong disc - like spectra ( states a and b ) and states with strong high - energy emission ( state c ; see belloni et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "spectra accumulated over long timescales ( e.g. a single _ rxte _ pointing , which is typically a few thousand seconds long ) are quite often a mixture of states , so can not be averaged together .",
    "therefore , we can either extract spectra on much shorter timescales , shorter than the spectral variability timescale , or try to find longer periods with little variability .",
    "we first investigated longer timescales by accumulating spectra over entire pointed observations ( designated by an identifier , obsid ) .",
    "we selected only stable data intervals with less then 5 per cent rms variability in light curves with 16-s resolution .",
    "there are some observations in which the source was only in the disc - like state a or b with very little variability .",
    "these were classified as variability states @xmath20 and @xmath21 by belloni et al .",
    "however , they do not show necessarily show disc - dominated spectra .",
    "we use the spectrum from obsid 10408 - 01 - 20 - 00 as an example of variability class @xmath20 to illustrate the difficulties in fitting these spectra .",
    "we extracted these data ( all pcus , all layers ) , together with background and response using ftools 5.3 using standard extraction criteria .",
    "we added a 1 per cent systematic error in each energy channel to account for the residual uncertainties in the response .",
    "we fitted them with the model described in section [ sec : model ] , using diskbb for the disc emission .",
    "[ fig : lt20 ] shows our best - fitting deconvolution of this spectrum , together with residuals which are dominated by a known resonance absorption line ( kotani et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the continuum curvature is best described by a weak , low - temperature disc plus substantial amounts of comptonized emission than by a disc alone .",
    "this could simply represent the effects of distortion by compton scattering within the disc itself , but such strong distortions are not predicted by the best current disc models .",
    "these remain rather close to a diskbb shape as long as the dissipation of gravitational potential energy occurs at more than a few optical depths within the disc ( davis et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "such low - temperature comptonization contrasts with the usual spectral decomposition for the high / soft state in black hole binaries , where the spectrum can be dominated by the disc , with a weak comptonized emission with photon spectral index of @xmath22 .",
    "however , high luminosity black hole binaries can also show an alternative type of spectrum , where the spectrum below 20  kev can be characterized by comptonization with a temperature of 1030  kev , together with the disc emission ( very high state / steep power law state e.g. kubota et al 2001 ; kubota & done 2004 ) .",
    "the temperature inferred here is much lower , at @xmath23  kev , but it could be a more extreme version of this state .",
    "the energy dependence of the variability gives another argument for the reality of this low - temperature comptonization component .",
    "zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2001 ; 2005 ) found similar spectral decompositions ( disc plus low - temperature comptonization ) for apparently disc - like spectra from the @xmath24 state of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "they show that the rms variability spectrum for these data increases with energy , as predicted from models of a relatively stable disc and a more variable comptonization component .",
    "thus , it seems likely that even these apparently disc - like spectra are distorted by a ( low temperature ) comptonization component . since the disc luminosity and temperature can be significantly distorted in spectra with strong comptonization ( kubota & done 2004",
    "; done & kubota 2006 ) , then these data can not be used to give robust estimates of the disc properties .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     a more direct measure of black hole spin may be given by the high - frequency ( hf ) pair of qpo features which seem fairly fixed in frequency and in a 3:2 harmonic relation ( though in grs 1915 + 105 the frequency ratio are 3.36:2 , so not exact ; strohmayer 2001 ) .",
    "harmonics are most naturally associated with a resonance in the disc , but again there are several possibilities for this resonance so as yet no unique way to translate these frequencies into black hole spin .",
    "trk et al .",
    "( 2005 ) review the possible orbital resonances in a thin disc , and highlight the parametric resonance between vertical and radial epicyclic modes in strong gravity as these rather naturally give a 3:2 ratio ( kluniak & abramowicz 2002 ) .",
    "this identification implies @xmath6 = 0.90.98 for the observed hf qpos in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "however , there are other resonances even in a thin disc which can also give a 3:2 ratio , though these generally predict other harmonics as well . depending on which of these is chosen as the origin for the hf qpos gives a value for the spin spanning the whole range from @xmath6 = 00.998 ( trk et al .",
    "another , perhaps more attractive possibility , is that the hf qpo is a resonance in a _ thick _",
    "disc , where there are additional modes available from compression and extension of the disc scale height ( breathing modes ) .",
    "blaes , arras & fragile ( 2006 ) show that a ` natural ' 3:2 resonance forms between the vertical epicyclic mode and a ` breathing ' mode ( blaes , arras & fragile 2006 ) .",
    "this identification gives much weaker constraints on spin than the parametric resonance .",
    "the dispersion of values for the spin does not look promising and obviously all the techniques covered here have differing strengths and weaknesses . for the spectral methods , the physical origin of the features ( disc or iron line ) is clear , and the uncertainties are due to the observations , or rather how to unambiguously isolate the disc emission or relativistic line profile in a complex spectrum .",
    "conversely , the timing methods are unambiguous observationally , but lack a theoretical model to uniquely associate the measured frequencies with black hole spin .",
    "nonetheless , from this brief review it is clear that only potentially significant conflict with moderate ( @xmath25 ) spin in grs 1915 + 105 for a reasonable distance is the parametric resonance interpretation of the hf qpo which requires @xmath26 , while the newer interpretation of this as the resonance between the vertical epicyclic and ` breathing ' modes is consistent with any spin .",
    "we note that the parametric resonance between the radial and vertical epicycles interpretation of the hf qpos also gives a much higher spin for gro j165540 and xte j1550564 of @xmath27 ( trk et al 2005 ) than are derived from their disc spectrum , @xmath28 ( shafee et al .",
    "2006 ) and @xmath29 ( davis et al .",
    "2006 ) , respectively .",
    "there are no issues in these sources with the strong variability or interstellar absorption , and the distances are rather better determined , so there seems to be a clear discrepancy between the results of the parametric resonance interpretation of the hf qpos and the disc spectra .",
    "again , this conflict is removed if the hf qpo is instead a resonance between the vertical epicyclic and breathing modes ( blaes et al .",
    "one of the big questions in understanding accretion flows is how the jet is powered , whether it predominantly taps the gravitational potential or whether it predominantly taps the spin energy plausibly via the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "the possibility of spin powered jets has given rise to persistent speculation in the literature that relativistic jets require a maximally spinning black hole .",
    "grs  1915 + 105 is the most powerful x - ray binary jet source in our galaxy , so is a key object for testing models of jet formation .",
    "our fits to the disc - dominated spectra from this source clearly show that the spin is unlikely to be maximal , though it is substantial ( @xmath6 = 0.70.8 for any reasonable distance estimate ) .",
    "the same technique ( simultaneous fitting of a series of disc dominated spectra at differing luminosities ) gives non - maximal spins ( @xmath6 = 0.10.8 ) for four other galactic black holes ( davis et al .",
    "2006 ; shafee et al .",
    "these objects also show radio jets , sometimes with superluminal motion , so it is clear that these results imply that powerful jets do not require maximally spinning black holes .",
    "the next question is whether spin is needed at all in producing a jet , i.e. whether the jet can be purely powered by gravity .",
    "observationally it is clear that the jet power scales with accretion rate ( gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) .",
    "since all the galactic black holes are more or less consistent with the same ratio of radio to x - ray power ( which traces the jet to accretion power ) at a given @xmath30 ( in the hard spectral state ) , then the observed range of @xmath6 = 0.10.8 implies that the ratio of jet to accretion power does not depend strongly on spin .",
    "this immediately favours gravity powered jets , as spin powered jet models generically depend rather strongly on spin !    the best current jet models are those which are produced in numerical simulations of the jet / accretion flow .",
    "these include the self - consistent , magnetically generated stresses and produce jets and outflows without additional physics .",
    "these show in general that the jet has two components , a matter dominated , funnel wall jet and an electromagnetic poynting flux jet ( mckinney 2005 ; hawley & krolik 2006 ) .",
    "the electromagnetic jet is probably highly relativistic with bulk lorentz factor @xmath31 , and is very strongly dependent on @xmath6 , indicating that this may be partly ( or perhaps even mostly ) powered by the black hole spin ( mckinney & gammie 2004 ) .",
    "by contrast , the funnel wall jet is less relativistic ( perhaps only lorentz factors @xmath32  23 ) and is much less dependent on black hole spin ( mckinney 2005 ; hawley & krolik 2006 ) .",
    "the potential power of the matter jet relative to the accretion power increases by only a factor 2 between @xmath6 = 0.5 and 0.95 ( hawley & krolik 2006 ) .",
    "such a small change is unlikely to result in much scatter in the observed ratio of radio to x - ray luminosity , in contrast with the factor 11 for the poynting flux jet ( hawley & krolik 2006 ) . while we caution that the simulations do not currently include radiation , so can not yet be unambiguously connected to observations , it seems that the funnel wall , matter dominated jet , powered predominantly by the gravity of the accretion flow , matches rather well to the properties of the jets in galactic black hole binaries in that it can accommodate the observed constancy of radio to x - ray flux at a given @xmath30 from objects with the variety of spins inferred here ( see mckinney 2005 ) .",
    "the moderate spins derived from the disc spectra ( as opposed to the near maximal spins derived from the hf qpos : trk et al .",
    "2005 ) also match with the theoretical predictions for the birth spin distribution of black holes , as the pre - supernovae core before stellar collapse is slowly rotating , and spin up from captured fallback of material is countered by angular momentum loss in gravitational waves during the formation process ( see e.g. the review by gammie , shapiro & mckinney 2004 ) .",
    "spin - up through accretion during the lifetime of the binary is limited in most systems as the companion mass is generally smaller than the black hole mass ( king & kolb 1999 ) .",
    "we have searched the _ rxte _ spectra from grs 1915 + 105 to find the rare disc - dominated states . these can only be found at the shortest pca ( standard-2 data ) timescales of 16 s , as such spectra are seen only during the unique limit cycle variability of this source .",
    "we fit these with the best current models of the accretion disc spectrum , which include full radiative transfer through a solar abundance atmosphere as well as the full relativistic dissipation ( with stress free inner boundary condition ) and ray tracing to incorporate the relativistic effects on propagation of the emission ( davis et al . 2005 ; davis & hubeny 2006 ) .",
    "this gives the spin of the black hole as @xmath28 , assuming the best current estimate for distance and binary system parameters .",
    "this , together with spins determined using this method for other galactic black holes gives a distribution of @xmath33 0.10.8 i.e. low - to - moderate spin .",
    "moderate ( as opposed to maximal ) spins are consistent with theoretical expectations of the spin distribution of galactic black holes , and with the jet properties , but conflict with the high - to - maximal spin inferred ( often for the same objects ) from the broad iron line profile and parametric vertical - radial epicyclic resonance interpretation of the hf qpos . while the broad line profile may be distorted by highly ionized absorption lines ( done & gierliski 2006 ) , the discrepancy between the spins derived from disc spectra and those derived from the vertical - radial epicyclic resonance interpretation of the hf qpo appears robust .",
    "given the apparent simplicity of the accretion disc behaviour , it seems most likely that the hf qpo should instead be associated with another resonance in the disc , plausibly the vertical epicycle - breathing resonance identified by blaes et al .",
    "we thank jean - pierre lasota and steve balbus for useful discussions on the difference between spin and gravity powered jets . we also thank julian krolik and jon mckinney for their help in understanding how to interpret the results of the mri simulations .",
    "the editors of mnras probably deserve the undying gratitude of the readers for objecting to the wretched pun of the original title of ` the spin of grs 1915 + 105 : why do we kerr ? '"
