    "for this reason in literature have been proposed alternative processes with finite velocity .",
    "the first model of this type , introduced by goldstein ( 1951 ) and kac ( 1974 ) , is the telegraph process which describes the motion of a particle on the real line .",
    "the planar random flights are a possible extension in @xmath6 of the telegraph process .",

    "iacus ( 2001 ) considers the estimation of the parameter @xmath25 of a non - constant rate @xmath26 .",
    "more recently , de gregorio and iacus ( 2006 ) introduce a pseudo - maximum likelihood estimator and a least squares estimator for the parameter @xmath3 when the sample paths of the telegraph process are observed only at equidistant discrete times .",
    "the authors also analyze the same statistical problem for a geometric telegraph process particularly interesting in view of financial applications . for a telegraph process observed at discrete times , iacus and yoshida ( 2006 ) study the asymptotic ( i.e. the mesh decreases to zero and the horizon interval tends to infinity ) properties of two moment estimators and propose also an estimator consistent , asymptotically normal and efficient .",
    "the aim of this paper is the estimation of the parameter @xmath3 when the process @xmath0 is observed at @xmath1 equidistant times @xmath27 , where @xmath28 we consider two types of asymptotic framework :    \\1 ) @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xmath31 ;    \\2 ) @xmath31 with @xmath32 fixed .",
    "the statistical problem is interesting because the planar random flights seem to be useful for ecology and biology applications .",
    "in fact , holmes ( 1993 ) and holmes et al . ( 1994 ) consider these models to represent the displacements of the animals and microorganisms on a surface .",
    "we note that when the planar random flight is observed continuously , then @xmath33 is the optimal estimator of the parameter @xmath3 and our statistical problem is equivalent to the estimate of a whole poisson process on @xmath34 $ ] ( see kutoyants ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "the process @xmath0 is not markovian .",
    "hence , it is not possible to explicit the likelihood function of the points observed as product of the transition densities .",
    "this fact implies that we can not use the tools developed for the diffusion processes ( see sorensen ( 1997 ) and soresen ( 2004 ) for an account of these estimation methods ) .",
    "the main idea of this paper is to consider the points @xmath35 as @xmath5 independent copies of a random flight up to time @xmath32 ( which is untrue ) . in this manner",
    "we can build an estimating function from which it is possible to derive a pseudo - maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the random motion considered here and present some results concerning the process @xmath36 ( for example the moments ) . in section 3",
    "we introduce a pseudo - likelihood function @xmath37 and propose the following estimator @xmath38 under the asymptotic scheme 1 ) the estimator @xmath39 is asymptotically normal and efficient . alternatively under the same asymptotic scheme , we present an estimator asymptotically efficient without additional hypotheses . by considering the second asymptotic framework in section 4 , we can study the convergence of the estimator @xmath39 by means of the pseudo - likelihood ratio . in the last section ,",
    "we analyze the empirical performance of @xmath39 by means of a monte carlo analysis .",
    "we consider a particle starting at the arbitrary point @xmath7 of the plane @xmath6 , moving with constant finite speed @xmath8 .",
    "the initial direction is a random variable @xmath25 uniformly distributed in @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the changes of direction are governed by a homogeneous poisson process with parameter @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , when a poisson time occurs the particle takes a new direction uniformly distributed in @xmath9 $ ] , independently from the previous one .",
    "we indicate the position of the particle at time @xmath13 with the stochastic process @xmath20 , which is called _ random flight _ in the plane . at time",
    "@xmath22 the particle is located in the disc @xmath40 with probability 1 .",
    "if no poisson event occurs the particle reaches the circle @xmath41 with probability @xmath42    the remaining part of the distribution lies in the interior of and represents the absolute continuous component of the distribution @xmath43    we note that the random flights have trajectories which assume the form of broken lines where the single steps have random length and are uniformly oriented in @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "however , the total length for any sample paths at time @xmath22 is @xmath44 .",
    "the density law of @xmath20 ( see kolesnik and orsingher ( 2005 ) ) is equal to @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 representing respectively the dirac s delta function and the indicator function .",
    "now , we present some results concerning the following process @xmath48 i.e. the euclidean distance from the origin of the space @xmath6 of the position reaches by the moving particle at time @xmath49    the following theorem contains our first result .    the absolute continuous component of the process @xmath50 , when @xmath51 , is equal to @xmath52 with @xmath53",

    "* remark 2.2 * we derive from the mean value of @xmath68 @xmath75    in the particular case @xmath76 , we can write the square mean in terms of simple function .",
    "in fact , by means of the following relationship @xmath77 we get that @xmath78",
    "we assume that the planar random flight @xmath79 , with @xmath80 , is observed only at @xmath1 equidistant discrete times @xmath81 where @xmath82 we use the following notation to simplify the formulas : @xmath83    the interest is the estimation of the parameter @xmath3 whilst the velocity @xmath8 is assumed to be known .",
    "in other words , we want to estimate the rate of change of a microorganism which performs a planar random flight , when we are able to observe its position only at discrete times .",
    "the estimation of @xmath8 is an uninteresting problem .",
    "in fact , if in the interval @xmath84 $ ] there are not changes of direction , then @xmath85 . if @xmath32 is suitable small , there is high probability of observing @xmath86 and @xmath8 can be calculated without error .",
    "analogously to the telegraph process , the random flights are not markovian . for this reason we can not write the explicit likelihood of the process in the form of product of transition densities as well as for diffusion processes .",
    "therefore , we need an alternative argument in the spirit of the paper by de gregorio and iacus ( 2006 ) .",
    "we define a pseudo - likelihood function as follows . by taking into account the distribution , we introduce the following data dependent function @xmath87 where @xmath88    the transition densities @xmath89 appearing in represent the distribution of a random flight in @xmath6 , initially located at the point @xmath90 at time @xmath91 , which reaches the position @xmath92 at the instant @xmath93 .",

    "* remark 3.1 * in the expression , the factor @xmath99 concerns the singular part of the densities @xmath89 , while the product represents the absolutely continuous components of the distributions of the random flights .",
    "note that for increasing values of @xmath3 , the absolutely continuous component of has a bigger weight than the singular component ; viceversa for small values of @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig ] shows how the two components of the function @xmath37 emerge for this scheme of observation .",
    "+ to define our estimator , we borrow the approach based on estimating functions .",
    "formula yields @xmath100 and the estimator is obtained by solving @xmath101 .    by taking into account the function",
    "we derive the following pseudo - maximum likelihood estimator for the parameter @xmath3",
    "@xmath102    it is easy to see that @xmath103 and the uniqueness of the estimator holds .",
    "however @xmath39 is not a true maximum likelihood estimator because @xmath37 is not a true likelihood function . in the section 4",
    "we will analyze the empirical performance of the estimator for small sample size .    by considering the following asymptotic framework @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xmath104",

    "we need to introduce another hypothesis : the distance @xmath32 between two consecutive instants @xmath138 is such that the following condition holds @xmath139 where @xmath140 .    in other words between the points @xmath90 and @xmath141 the planar random flights have at least one change of direction ( or equivalently @xmath142 ) . in general",
