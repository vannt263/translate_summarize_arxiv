    "in this paper we study the local minimizers of @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a bounded and smooth domain in @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the characteristic function of the set @xmath13 , and @xmath2 are positive constants such that @xmath14 the class of admissible functions @xmath15 consists of those functions @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 for a given boundary datum @xmath19 .",
    "this type of problems arises in jet flow models with two ideal fluids , see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite page 126 , and has been studied in @xcite for @xmath8 .",
    "when the velocity @xmath20 of the planar flow depends on the gradient of the stream function @xmath5 in power law @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) , then the resulted problem for steady state admits a variational formulation with the functional . in higher dimensions , this models heat ( or electrostatic ) energy optimization under power fourier law ,",
    "see @xcite .    for admissible functions in @xmath22",
    "the analogous problem has been studied in @xcite .",
    "however , the two - phase problem for general growth functionals has remained fundamentally open . towards this direction",
    "there are only some partial results available under the assumption of small lebesgue density on the negative phase , see  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the lack of a monotonicity formula for  @xmath23 .",
    "however , some weak form of monotonicity type formula is known for the modified alt - caffarelli - friedman functional , namely a discrete monotonicity formula in two spatial dimensions when  @xmath24 is close to  2 , see  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold and contributes into the regularity theory of the two - phase free boundary problems : first , we define a suitable notion of flatness for free boundary points which allows to partition the set @xmath25 into to disjoint subsets @xmath26 and @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the set of flat free boundary points and @xmath27 the set of non - flat points .",
    "these sets are determined by the critical flatness constant @xmath29 , such that if the flatness at @xmath30 is less that @xmath29 then the free boundary must be regular in some vicinity of @xmath31 .",
    "consequently we can stratify the free boundary points and prove linear growth at the non - flat points of free boundary ( see section [ sec : main ] for precise definitions and statements ) .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it avoids using the optimal regularity for @xmath5 everywhere and hence circumvents the obstacle imposed by the lack of monotonicity formula .",
    "however , our technique renders the local lipschitz continuity using a simple consequence of theorem a below .",
    "observe that the non - flat points @xmath32 are more interesting to study and it is vital to have linear growth at such points @xmath31 in order to classify the blow - up profiles .",
    "second , to study the flat points @xmath33 we apply the regularity theory developed for viscosity solutions of two - phase free boundary problems .",
    "to do so we prove that any local minimizer is also a viscosity solution . at flat points",
    "we get that the free boundary @xmath25 is very close to a plane in a suitable coordinate system .",
    "consequently , @xmath5 must be @xmath34monotone with @xmath35 small , which in turn implies that the free boundary is @xmath36 in some vicinity of @xmath31 .",
    "this approach , which is based on the fusion of variational and viscosity solutions , appears to be new and very useful .",
    "finally , from here we conclude the partial regularity of @xmath25 , that is @xmath25 is countably rectifiable and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the @xmath7-dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that our approach is new even for the classical case @xmath8 .    in the forthcoming section [ sec : main ]",
    "we give the precise statements of the results that we prove . a detailed plan on the organization of the paper",
    "will be presented at the end of section [ sec : main ] .",

    "first , we fuse the variational methods with the viscosity theory . this is done by proving that any local minimizer @xmath16 is also a viscosity solution ( see section [ sec : visc ] , and in particular theorem [ th : viscosity ] ) .",
    "the key ingredient in the proof is the linear development of a nonnegative @xmath58harmonic function @xmath98 in @xmath13 near @xmath99 that vanishes continuously on @xmath100 , see lemma [ lemma : linear ] .",
    "there is a subtle point in the proof of the linear development lemma which amounts to the following claim : if @xmath60 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 then @xmath5 has linear growth near @xmath4 , i.e. there is a constant @xmath103 ( depending on @xmath4 ) such that @xmath104 near @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , by standard barrier argument we have that @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "therefore @xmath107 has linear growth near @xmath4 .",
    "now the linear growth of @xmath108 near @xmath4 follows form lemma [ lem : dndooo ] .",
    "clearly the same claim is valid if @xmath109 and @xmath102 .",
    "we stress on the fact that lemma [ lemma : linear ] on linear development remains valid for solutions to a wider class of equations for which harnack s inequality and hopf s lemma are valid .",
    "second , we compare @xmath110 with the minimal height @xmath68 of the parallel slab of planes containing @xmath111 , for @xmath60 .",
    "more precisely , take @xmath112 , and fix @xmath113 , then @xmath114 or @xmath115 consequently , for given @xmath60 there are two alternatives : either for some @xmath116 we arrive at and this will mean that @xmath4 is a flat point of @xmath25 ( if @xmath113 is small ) or holds for sufficiently large @xmath117 . the latter implies linear growth at @xmath4 .",
    "note that the non - flat points are more interesting to study and having the linear growth at such points allows one to use compactness argument and blow - up @xmath5 in order to study the properties of the resulted configuration as done in the proofs of , and .",

    "altogether , this approach allows us to prove the main properties of the free boundary without using the full optimal regularity of @xmath5 and can be applied to a wide class of variational free boundary problems with two phases . a diagram showing the scheme of the proof",
    "is given below .",
    "as for the proof of the partial regularity result , i.e. @xmath120 we employ a non - degeneracy result obtained in proposition [ str - nd - hi ] for @xmath108 and some estimates for the radon measure @xmath121 given in lemma [ lem-7.11 ] .",
    "this is a standard approach but more involved because the linear growth is valid only at non - flat points of the free boundary .      in section  [ sec : tec ]",
    "we collect some material , mostly of technical nature , that we will use in the other sections .",

    "we now finish the proof of theorem b. more precisely , we show that @xmath658    first observe that @xmath659 , see the discussion in section [ sec : eps ] . since the current boundary @xmath660{0.5pt}{4mm}\\rule[-0.5mm]{4mm}{0.5pt}}\\{u>0\\}\\cap b_r(0))$ ]",

    "hence we infer that @xmath669 is a function of bounded variation which is constant a.e . in @xmath670 .",
    "the positive lebesgue density property of @xmath671 obtained in lemma [ density est ] and translated to @xmath352 through compactness , and the strong maximum principle for @xmath58harmonic functions demand @xmath352 to be zero .",

    "with the aid of theorem a , in this section we complete the proof of theorem c.    it is well - know that in order to prove the estimate it is enough to show that @xmath5 grows linearly away from the free boundary .",

    "notice that , if for all @xmath112 , @xmath675 , we have that @xmath676 , then it follows from theorem a that @xmath677 .",

    "furthermore , yields @xmath683 and by we see that @xmath684 is @xmath81 flat .",
