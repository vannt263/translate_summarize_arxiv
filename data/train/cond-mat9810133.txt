    "the sliding motion of a charge density wave ( cdw ) is one of the most interesting phenomena in low dimensional conductors . under an electric field smaller than a certain threshold field @xmath0 , the cdw is pinned by impurities , lattice and so on in the sample , and the electric conductivity is small . above @xmath0 ,",
    "the cdw starts sliding motion and causes a sharp increase of the electric conductivity , the spontaneous current oscillation , which is known by the name of the narrow band noise , and other various peculiar electric conduction phenomena @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are well described by the classical - mechanical treatment of the fukuyama ",
    "lee  rice ( flr ) model @xcite , which treats the cdw as a deformable object under pinning potentials @xcite .    below @xmath0 ,",
    "the creep motion of the cdw occurs with a help of thermal noise in the usual temperature range .",
    "then the conductance is given as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the effective barrier height .",
    "in the lower temperature range , however , the quantum effect is expected to be important .",
    "in fact zaitsev ",
    "zotov observed in o-@xmath3 a temperature independent nonlinear conduction below @xmath0 in the temperature range below @xmath4 k , which is considered to be due to quantum mechanical tunneling of the cdw @xcite .",
    "the experiment was carried out in the two - probe configuration .",
    "he also found that the following dependence of the conductance @xmath5 on the electric field @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 $ ] in the range @xmath9 \\lesim \\varepsilon",
    "\\lesim   1 \\times 10 ^ 4 [ { \\rm v / m}]$ ] . this form is different from the one due to the zener - tunneling @xcite or the creation of kink  antikink pairs @xcite .",
    "the above nonlinear conduction below @xmath0 is observed only in thin samples .    in the framework of the semiclassical theory ,",
    "the cdw current due to the quantum tunneling is related to the decay rate of the metastable state .",
    "then the conductance is expressed as @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the euclidean action for the `` bounce '' solution , which is the least action solution , corresponding to the proper tunneling process @xcite .",
    "duan proposed the `` vortex shell '' in the @xmath12 dimensional space as the `` bounce '' solution , and obtained the same electric field dependence as that in eq.([eq : exdep ] ) @xcite .",
    "the vortex shell represents the conversion process from the single  particle current to the cdw current or opposite by expanding the dislocation loop ( or `` vortex ring '' in terms of the phase ) in the perpendicular plane to the one  dimensional direction as shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "the motion of dislocation loop causes the phase slippage @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath13 in eq.([eq : exdep ] ) that duan estimated is , however , about @xmath14 times as large as that in the experiment .",
    "this is because he assumed the homogeneous cdw system , the quantum nucleation can occur wherever in the sample with the same probability , and the energy gain due to the creation of a vortex shell comes from the interaction of the cdw with the external electric field .",
    "maki @xcite noticed that the experiment was carried out in the two - probe configuration , and considered the strong pinning by the electric probes at both ends of the sample at first .",
    "he reset the distance between the probes to the flr coherence length in the case of @xmath15d weak pinning to get the agreement with the experiment .",
    "the reason of the replacement is , however , not clear .",
    "the motion of cdw is expressed by the extracted macroscopic degrees of freedom in these work but the dissipation due to the interaction between them and the other degrees of freedom is neglected , which can affect the conductance due to quantum tunneling @xcite , and is important in comparison with experiments . in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of the ohmic dissipation on the quantum phase slippage according to caldeira ",
    "leggett theory @xcite .",
    "we write down the `` bounce '' action in  [ sec : form ] in the case without dissipation , and add to this the dissipation term coming from the interaction between the extracted macroscopic degree of freedom and the normal electrons in  [ sec : diss ] .",
    "we see that the evaluated dissipation term can modify the dependence of the conductance in the electric field . in  [ sec : conc ] , we discuss the result obtained in ",
