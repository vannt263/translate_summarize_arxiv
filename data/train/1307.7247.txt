    "the theory of the multiphoton transitions in atoms on the basis of quantum mechanics ( qm ) started with the work by gppert - mayer @xcite .",

    "accurate evaluations of the two - photon transition rates in hydrogen are important for several reasons .",
    "first , during the last decades the two - photon @xmath5 transition frequency measurements reached exclusively high level of accuracy @xcite-@xcite and the accurate measurements of the two - photon @xmath6 , @xmath7 frequency transitions were also reported @xcite , @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the accuracy limits for these measurements require the knowledge of the corresponding transition rates @xcite .",
    "second , the two - photon transition rates in hydrogen are important for astrophysics , since these processes were involved in the formation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) during the epoch of the cosmological hydrogen recombination .",
    "recent accurate measurements of the properties of cmb also require the accurate knowledge of the two - photon @xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 etc .",
    "transition rates in hydrogen . for this purpose",
    "the two - photon transition rates in hydrogen were evaluated in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there is an essential difference in the description of the two - photon @xmath8 and the two - photon transitions to the ground state from the higher levels.this difference is due to the presence of the cascade contributions which are absent only in @xmath8 transition .",
    "the cascade problem in the two - photon transitions in two - electron hci was first discussed in @xcite .",
    "the same problem was considered later in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) a general qed approach was developed which allows for the description of cascade transitions . in the theory of the cascade transition rates an important question is the regularization of the singular cascade contributions to the total two - photon transition rate .",
    "this regularization is performed by the introduction of the level widths in the energy denominators which otherwise turn to zero for the photon frequencies , corresponding to the cascade resonances . in the qm phenomenological",
    "approach only the width of the intermediate state is usually employed for regularization @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we call this approach phenomenological since the width is introduced as an phenomenological parameter . in the qed approach @xcite , @xcite based on the low derivation of the lorentz profile from qed @xcite ,",
    "the regularization is performed via the introduction of the sum of two widths , for the initial and intermediate states .",
    "note , that in @xcite the possibility of using the sum of the widths was briefly mentioned . in @xcite-@xcite",
    "the qed approach for the description of the multiphoton transitions with cascades was applied to the decays of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 states in the hydrogen atom .    in the present paper",
    "we compare both methods of regularization .",
    "a detailed derivation of the qed regularization approach is given .",
    "we also demonstrate that qm phenomenological approach being properly used gives the same result as qed , i.e. with the sum of two widths . the importance of the correct regularization will be also illustrated .",

    "an ambiguity of this separation was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the cascade contribution can be presented as the sum of the contributions of two cascade links ( resonances ) : @xmath22 where two resonant frequencies are : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "this also violates the equivalence mentioned above .",
    "in the second part of the paper we address the same problem of the cascade regularization within the qm approach following mainly @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the derivation is given for one - photon transitions between two excited atomic states , which corresponds to one `` link''of the two - photon cascade transition .",
    "we extend this derivation to the full two - photon transition rate , including cascade , `` pure '' two - photon and interference contributions .",

    "vii the 3-photon transitions are analysed in the `` two - photon approximation '' with 3-photon decay @xmath55 as an example . in the section viii the qm approach",

    "is demonstrated .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in section x.",
    "the full qed description of any process in an atom should start with the ground state and end up with the ground state too , i.e. the excitation of the decaying state should be always included .",
    "for the resonant processes , e.g. for the resonant photon scattering the absorption part of the process can be well separated from the emission part , so that the description of the decay process independent on the excitation becomes possible . in this way the theory of the multiphoton processes in atoms was developed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "having in mind the recombination processes in hydrogen atom we consider first the resonance photon scattering on the ground @xmath56 state with resonances corresponding to the @xmath41 states . in our derivations",
    "we will fully neglect the photons other than @xmath57 which is reasonable for the neutral hydrogen .",
    "it is important to stress that we consider the free atoms which are excited by the photons released by the source which line widths is comparable ( or larger ) then the natural line widths of the resonance atomic state .",

    "the photon frequency @xmath80 is close to the energy difference between two atomic levels . in case of @xmath41 resonance @xmath81 .",

    "( [ 18 ] ) reveals that in the resonance approximation the scattering amplitude is factorized into an emission and absorption parts .",
