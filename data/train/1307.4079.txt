    "radial variations in ages and metallicities of stellar populations ( sps ) have been shown to be efficient tools to discriminate among different galaxy formation scenarios . recently ,",
    "a plethora of studies have dedicated attention to the analysis of gradients in colours and absorption features for wide samples of local early - type galaxies ( etgs ; e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* herafter t+10 ) ; @xcite ) , deriving sp gradients by means of stellar population synthesis ( sps ) analysis .",
    "whilst these works consistently find a decrease in the metallicity at large radii as the cause of both line - strength and colour gradients , the scatter in the galaxy properties at fixed stellar mass still prevent from deriving robust constraints on the competing galaxy formation models on the market ( @xcite ) .    for instance , a well known class of these models is represented by the so - called monolithic models .",
    "steep metallicity gradients ( @xmath2 per decade variation in radius ) are expected from classical dissipative collapse models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and their revised versions starting from semi - cosmological initial conditions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these metallicity gradients arise because the stars form everywhere in the collapsing cloud and then remain in orbit with a little inward motion whereas the gas falls down because of dissipation .",
    "this falling gas contains the new metals ejected by evolving stars so that a metallicity gradient develops in the gas . as stars continue to form , their composition reflects the gaseous abundance gradient . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that monolithic hydrodynamical models can be able to satisfy different local correlations , as the mass  metallicity and the mass@xmath3 $ ] relations and produce metallicity gradients of @xmath4 , consistent with several observational samples ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these results have been possible thanks to the requirement , fulfilled by the models , that the stars produced have high average @xmath3 $ ] in the cores and thus short sf , and smaller age gradients .",
    "it is however important to note that some simulations in the suite by @xcite and @xcite still feature very steep metallicity gradients of @xmath2 , explaining the observed scatter in massive etgs ( e.g. @xcite ) in terms of variations in the initial conditions and in particular in the efficiency of star formation ( sf ) processes .",
    "these authors explain the metallicity gradients in massive etgs without recurring to strong agn feedback ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which have been suggested to flatten the gradients .",
    "cosmological simulations require that the formation of massive galaxies must include at least a few `` dry mergers '' ( @xcite ) : these would flatten any pre - existing metallicity gradients ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "only if the pre - existing gradients in the progenitors of a merging system are enough steep , it is possible that the descendant model galaxy will match the observed values at @xmath50 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , observations of local massive ellipticals do not have enough constraining power as models improve in complexity , each of them featuring a mixture of different channels for galaxy formation , in order to break such degeneracies , both observational and numerical studies at different environments and redshift are needed .    from the observational point of view ,",
    "to have a full picture is necessary to analyze colour and sp gradients in higher - redshift galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the available datasets cover local environments and only few studies allow the investigation of colour and sp gradients at higher redshifts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we further exploit a sample of the hydrodynamical models for massive etgs in @xcite , we transform the sps of the model predictions ( evolution in metal content and sf history ) into magnitudes and colours using the sps in @xcite .",
    "this approach allows us to compare our models with observed colour gradients and avoid typical systematics ( as the age - metallicity degeneracy ) plaguing the sps fitting .",
    "we will concentrate on two different aspects :    1 .   the evolution with redshift of the colour gradients and the analysis of the role of the initial conditions of the models , as the initial gas density distribution , its mass content , and the rate of sf processes ; 2 .",
    "the comparison with observed color gradients at low / moderate redshift ( @xmath6 ) and high redshift ( i.e. @xmath7 ) ,    with the aim of testing the consequences of assuming one particular model , and to make predictions to be validated with future data .",

    "we adopted the hydrodynamical model in @xcite and @xcite to predict the evolution of sf and metallicity and sps models from @xcite to link the predicted sp evolution to observable quantities as colours .",
    "below we briefly summarize the simulation specifics and typical behaviours .",
    "we use a one - dimensional hydrodynamical model that follows the time evolution of the density of mass , momentum and internal energy of a galaxy , under the assumption of spherical symmetry . the standard gas - dynamical equations ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    "include source terms to describe the injection of total mass and energy in the gas due to the mass return and energy input from the stars , including snia and snii in a self - consistent way .",

    "the innermost zone is 10 pc wide . at the grid center",
    "we impose reflecting boundary condition , whereas we set outflow condition in the outermost point .    at every point of the mesh",
    "we allow the sf to occur at the following rate : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the _ local _ cooling and free - fall timescales , respectively , @xmath11 is the mass density and @xmath12 is a suitable _ sf parameter _ that contains all the uncertainties on the timescales of the sf process .",
    "we assume that the stars do not move from the gridpoints at which they have been formed , since we expect that the stars will spend most of their time close to their apocentre .",
    "as previously discussed in @xcite , very strong sn feedback can stop sf processes too early , predicting high @xmath13-enhancement in the galactic core and a too diffuse galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy input in the ism by sn is about @xmath14 ( @xcite ) , thus both the snia and snii efficiency are assumed to be @xmath15 .",
    "small variations ( e.g. @xmath16 ) do not affect the results . a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) ,",
    "constant in time in the range @xmath17 , is assumed .",
    "such imf has been shown to reproduce the photochemical properties of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a top - heavier imf would increase the production of sne and enhance the sn feedback ( @xcite ) , while a bottom - lighter imf ( as , e.g. @xcite ) would not impact sn feedback . although the investigation of the effects of the imf on the model behaviors is beyond the aims of this paper , the later discussion about the imf non  universality ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) represents a further important ingredient of the galaxy evolution to take into account in future simulations .",

    "the model have the largest initial dm mass .",
    "a limitation of the model is that we assume a fixed dm potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the details of the potential are not relevant for the baryonic processes as long as the dm has a characteristic radius much larger than that of the baryons ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is still a problem for simulations to reproduce sf histories that fit the chemical abundance data , if the baryon accretion follows the dm growth ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a more sophisticated description of the dm will be included in future works .",

    "we will further constrain the space of physical parameters involved .",
    "+      before discussing the details of the models it is worth briefly reminding their general behaviour , whereas we refer the reader to @xcite for a comprehensive analysis . at times",
    "earlier than few hundred myrs the gas is accumulating in the central regions where the density increases .",
    "the temperature drops due to cooling and , thus , the sf can proceed at very high rates . after a few hundred myrs the gas , being heated by sn explosions , is outflowing at the largest radii , while still being accreted in the central regions . afterwards",
    "( at times @xmath31 gyr , depending on the model ) a galactic wind driven by snia+ii involves the entire galaxy .",
    "such a behaviour is simply explained by the fact that the energy required to extract the gas from the galaxy outskirts is less than the work needed to have an outflow originating in the galactic center , leading to the correlation between metallicity and escape velocity gradient , as shown in @xcite .",
    "this strong wind can be maintained for several gyrs , contributing to the ejection of the chemical elements into the surrounding medium ( @xcite ) .",
    "these models exhibit metallicity gradients in the range @xmath32 dex per decade in radius and negligible age gradients ( cfr .",
    "table [ tab : sims ] ) .",
    "changes in the initial conditions within the same broad formation scenario create the scatter in the predicted gradients at a single mass .",
    "the shallower gradients predicted by this new monolithic models with respect to earlier dissipational collapse models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) derives from a constraint that was not available when the original collapse models were put forward , namely that it is necessary to produce stars with high [ @xmath30/fe@xmath29 ratios inhabiting the galactic core .",
    "this turns into a need for short duration of the sf ( accordingly to observations ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . hence , the metal enrichment process can not last more than 1 gyr , leading to small age gradients even in the most massive galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+      to derive quantities that can be compared with observations we use a set of `` single burst '' stellar population synthesis ( sps ) spectra from ( * ? ? ?",

    "we discuss the results for several sdss and hst pass bands , which will be compared with observations from the literature .",
    "we apply this procedure to the ssps formed in spherical annuli with radii from 0 to @xmath42 kpc , to reconstruct the colour profiles and average colours . to investigate spurious systematics arising from the assumption of a specific sps prescription we have also adopted an updated version of bc03 models ( bc03-updated , hereafter ; @xcite ) and ( * ?",
    "* m05 hereafter ) models , which include an improved treatment of the thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase ( tp - agb ) .",
    "we discuss the colour profile @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the two bands considered .",
    "the colour gradient is defined as the angular coefficient of the relation @xmath46 vs @xmath47 , @xmath48 , measured in @xmath49 ( omitted in the following unless needed for clarity ) . to take the analysis as simple as possible we avoid any projection of galaxy light distribution , calculating the gradients using the 3d distribution and the spherical half - mass radius .",
    "we have verified that for the scope of this paper the impact of this assumption is small , leaving unaffected our conclusions . in the worst cases ,",
    "the projection will flatten the steepest gradients of , at most @xmath50 mag / dex .",
    "the fit of each color profile is performed in different radial ranges ; in particular , to homogeneously compare with observations we often use the range @xmath51 .",
    "the spherical assumption is a possible limitation for our models , since calculating the colour gradients of more realistic triaxial or oblate systems along different lines of sights would produce different gradients .",
    "the inclusion of more complex geometries is a natural step forward in this kind of analyses . for the present paper ,",
    "we have limited our models to be as simple as possible , demonstrating that they can satisfactorily reproduce key low - redshift observations ( @xcite ) . under the assumption that the galaxy formation is fairly homogeneous ,",
    "as we expect to be in the case of an isolated galactic system , the presence of asymmetries in mass distribution is expected to be marginal . in this case",
    "it is instructive to study if any observed variation in the gradient can be traced back to variations in physical quantities , before taking the further step of relaxing the assumption of galaxies evolving homogenously and in isolation and introducing the effect of the merging on the gradient distribution .",
    "we note that , even in this last case , @xcite have demonstrated that gradients along different lines of sights of remnants of disk galaxies mergers present a scatter around the median gradient which is less that 0.1 , namely smaller than the observed scatter at a fixed galaxy mass .    on the observational side , while it is true that age / metallicity profiles taken at two different position angles may differ ( e.g. fig . 7 in @xcite ) , and we are aware that inhomogeneities and structures are clear also in 2-dimensional metallicity maps of ellipticals ( e.g. @xcite ) , these are plausibly second - order effects , related to the particular assembly history of a given galaxy and contributing very little to the scatter in the data .",
    "in this section , we discuss the main predictions of our simulations , concentrating on the evolution of colour profiles and colour gradients in the rest - frame of the galaxy , which provide us with information about the physics behind the simulations and the link with observables .    the profiles for the mass formed , metallicity and  color for the four models are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "we have shown that , although there are some disagreements with some high redshift observations ( e.g. @xcite ) , our monolithic models can reproduce a wide collection of low / intermediate redshift data samples and a fraction of data at high redshift ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the interplay between the evolution of the metallicity profiles and the radial behaviour of the sf history , both combined via the sps prescription , drives the evolution of the optical and near - ir colours .",
    "stars in all models are formed at very early stages ( @xmath132 ) and in a short period , in agreement with previous literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , while at later stages the galaxies evolve passively .",
    "the optical colours typically show stronger redshift evolution during this passive phase when compared with the near - ir one . in the early stages",
    "the models also present some strong features and very strong negative colour gradients .",
    "thus , accordingly to other sets of observables ( as metallicity and @xmath3 $ ] ) , a wide range of observations can be reproduced by the interplay of gas infall and outflow from evolved stars and supernovae .",
    "in particular , while the models with a smaller can consistently reproduce the data at @xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and local observations ( see top panel in fig . [",
    "fig : cartoon ] ; @xcite ) , those with larger  produce colour gradients which are steeper than local observations . to reconcile the latter models with results at @xmath0 further physical ingredients are necessary .",
    "the occurrence of at least one dry major merger at @xmath0 ( @xcite ) could wash out the gradients from the latter models (  and ) producing shallower gradients which are consistent with local estimates ( see top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ; @xcite ) and reproducing quite well all the other local correlations , but the occurrence of such events seem relatively uncommon ( @xcite ) .",
    "our models have been built to reproduce the local negative metallicity gradients at low redshift and do not predict positive observer - frame  at high redshift ( jointly with the negative ) .",
    "such positive gradients , although not common in the local massive etgs , are found at higher redshift ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they can be possibly reconciled with the simulated negative gradients if we assume a ) they have a huge amount of dust in the external regions ( @xmath133 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : gradients_obs_frame_2 ] ) , and/or b ) interactions with environment have stripped off the outer gas , and/or c ) a wet merging has generated a starburst in the core ( @xcite ) , and/or d ) a change of imf with radius inducing positive colour gradients ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent dry mergings could wash out such gradients contributing to match the local observations .",
    "if on the one hand too strong gradients in the dust seem unrealistic , our models are built for isolated galaxies , and do not take into account exogen phenomena as merging / close encounters / etc . or any variation in the imf , which could make redder the outskirts and the observed gradients positive .",
    "however , it seems not realistic to reproduce some gradients observed ( @xcite ) with any combination of age , metallicity and dust extinction ( see fig . [",
    "fig : gradients_obs_frame_2 ] ) .",
    "further physical `` unexplored '' galactic ingredients accounting for such features need to be investigated . recently",
    ", many works have contrasted the imf universality , suggesting a systematic imf variation with mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and with redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that imf can change as a function of redshift and within each galaxy , inducing non trivial variations in colour gradients ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have adopted monolithic hydrodynamical models of four massive etgs ( which we have called , ,  and ) from @xcite , which are combined with sps models from @xcite to convert the simulated metallicities and sf history into observed quantities as colour gradients .",
    "therefore , we provide a suite of model predictions which can be directly compared with low / high redshift measurements ( without any intermediate step , as the sps fitting to derive age / metallicity gradients in measured colour gradients ) .",
    "so far the new monolithic models proposed and analyzed in @xcite and @xcite  characterized by two main contrasting phenomena , infall of gas from the outer regions , and outflows due to the stellar and sn winds  reproduce some global correlations in local galaxies , as the z- and @xmath3$]-mass relations and give shallower  with respect to earlier models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular , @xcite have demonstrated that the models reproduce fairly well a ) the average z gradients ( @xmath134 ) and b ) the observed scatter in local etgs .",
    "this improvement of the models has been possible thanks to the requirement , matched by the models , that the stars produced have high average @xmath3 $ ] in the cores and thus short sf ( as found by observations ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and smaller age gradients ( @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper has consisted to present the redshift evolution of the color gradient in the simulated galaxies and to further constrain the model parameters by means of new and independent dataset . from the comparison with data , we infer the following main conclusions :    * the models  and",
    "show a quite good agreement with data sets at @xmath135 ( local sdss galaxies from @xcite - the top panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : gradients_obs_frame_2 ] ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) as well as with the rest - frame colour gradients derived in @xcite for a sample of six high - redshift ( @xmath7 ) galaxies .",
    "+ as already pointed out in @xcite ( for the intrinsic metallicity gradients ) the higher is the sf parameter , the steeper the color gradient .",
    "since the observations agree with those models with shallower gradients (  and ) , the data - model comparison seems to favor small values for . * despite the previous encouraging results , some disagreement is found when we further add the high redshift galaxies by @xcite . in particular , we find that the optical data tend to favor models producing the shallower colour and metallicity gradients ( i.e.  and ) , while most of the near - infrared gradients are consistent with the models with steeper gradients ( i.e.  and ) . * assuming that this latter case is true , models with higher  would require the intervention of some process which flatten the gradients , as , at least , 1 dry merger at @xmath0 to match local observations .",
    "* models allow us to investigate the role of other physical processes , parameterized through different initial conditions , as the central gas density , the gas density distribution .",
    "their effect on the gradient is smaller than that of , therefore , we present predictions that can be constrained when the statistics on high redshift gradients improve .",
    "in particular , when the initial gas distribution is flat , then the colour gradients are shallower and the difference is stronger in the outer regions",

    "this would suggest that a simultaneous variation of several parameters has to be invoked to reproduce such a data .",
    "unfortunately , we have verified that , not only our models do not work , but , using sps toy - models , combinations of age and metallicity gradients fail to reproduce such observations .",
    "some further parameter or more complex phenomena would be taken into account to reproduce such observations .",
    "we have finally discussed our results within a more complex physical scenario ( see sect . [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "as we have amply discussed , although our models reproduce several observational data , seem to fail in some galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , our models , by construction , do not reproduce the steep positive optical colour gradients ( ) in @xcite , which can be possibly originated by a ) wet mergings , b ) interaction with environment , c ) strong dust extinction gradients or d ) imf variation across the galaxies .",
    "moreover , the unsuccessful matching of combined data from @xcite and @xcite seem to be a difficult task to achieve adopting combinations of gradients in age , metallicity and dust extinction , suggesting that more work is needed to reproduce observations , including further and unexplored ingredients in the simulations .",
