    "the observation of varying binding energy of the valence electron , moving freely in a metallic cluster , has initiated the developement of several theoretical models . besides ab initio calculation , the most prominent representatives are the jellium model@xcite and , in analogy to methods already in use in nuclear physics , phenomenological shell models with modified potential terms like the clemenger - nilsson model or deformed woods - saxon potential@xcite-@xcite .    although these models describe the experimental data with reasonable accuracy , they do not give a theoretical explanation for the observed sequence of magic numbers .",
    "therefore the problem of a theoretical foundation of the magic numbers is still an open question .",
    "a more fundamental understanding of magic numbers found for metal clusters may be achieved if the underlying corresponding symmetry of the fermion many body system is determined .",
    "therefore a group theoretical approach seems appropriate .    in this paper",
    "we will determine the symmetry group , which generates the single particle spectrum of a metal cluster similar to jellium or phenomenological shell models , but includes the magic numbers right from the beginning .",
    "our approach is based on group theoretical methods developed within the framework of fractional calculus .    the fractional calculus @xcite-@xcite provides a set of axioms and methods to extend the coordinate and corresponding derivative definitions in a reasonable way from integer order n to arbitrary order @xmath1 : @xmath3 the concept of fractional calculus has attracted mathematicians since the days of leibniz . in physics ,",

    "we @xcite have proposed an extension of the ordinary rotation group so(n ) to the fractional case . based on this fractional rotation group , an extended fractional symmetric rotor model @xcite was presented , which was used for a successful description of the ground state band spectra of even - even nuclei .",

    "it has been demonstrated , that the caputo - riemann - riemann decomposition establishes a fundamental dynamic symmetry , which determines the magic numbers for protons and neutrons and furthermore describes the ground state properties like binding energies and ground state quadrupole deformations of nuclei with reasonable accuracy .",
    "on the basis of this encouraging result , in the present work we will demontrate , that the caputo - caputo - riemann decomposition of the 9-dimensional fractional rotation group generates a dynamic symmetry group , which determines the magic numbers in metal clusters accurately .",

    "<S> based on the riemann- and caputo definition of the fractional derivative we use the fractional extensions of the standard rotation group @xmath0 to construct a higher dimensional representation of a fractional rotation group with mixed derivative types . </S>",
    "<S> an analytic extended symmetric rotor model is derived , which correctly predicts the sequence of magic numbers in metal clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated , that experimental data may be described assuming a sudden change in the fractional derivative parameter @xmath1 which is interpreted as a second order phase transition in the region of cluster size with @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore it is demonstrated , that the four different realizations of higher dimensional fractional rotation groups may successfully be connected to the four fundamental interaction types realized in nature and may be therefore used for a prediction of magic numbers and binding energies of clusters with gravitational force and weak force respectively bound constituents .    the results presented lead to the conclusion , that mixed fractional derivative operators might play a key role for a successful unified theoretical description of all four fundamental forces realized in nature .    </S>",
