    "the subject of numerical relativity has made significant strides since 2005 , when pretorius  @xcite presented the first simulation of a binary black hole system , which extended over several orbits . since",
    "then the numerical relativity community has developed more and more sophisticated codes to track the evolution of highly relativistic binaries of compact objects , increasingly including neutron stars .",
    "the codes are stable and accurate so that they can be used for production runs .",
    "in fact , the problem nowadays is not so much within an individual run but lies in the vastness of the parameter space ( eight dimensional in the case of two spinning black holes ) .",
    "this calls for the development of sophisticated methods to exhaust this space  @xcite .    however , there are still several problems with the numerical simulations , which have not been entirely solved .",
    "we mention here only the issue of the outer boundary and the feasibility of a global numerical simulation of an entire space - time .",
    "these are largely conceptual issues , which have been dealt with mostly by practical considerations .",
    "the background behind these issues is that all numerical simulations of binary systems are based on an _ idealisation _",
    ": one assumes that the system under consideration does not interact with anything else , i.e. , that it be an _ isolated system _  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this idealisation leads to the requirement that the space - time manifold describing the system be asymptotically flat .",
    "the main consequence of this is that the gravitational radiation , which is emitted by the system can be read off uniquely at null - infinity , commonly denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "this is a non - trivial result since the background independence of the theory ( a consequence of the general coordinate invariance ) prohibits the introduction of any absolute structure to which the gravitational waves ( the proverbial ` ripples ' on space - time ) can be referred to .",
    "furthermore , the ` infinity ' of an asymptotically flat space - time is unique . as",
    "a consequence gravitational radiation is a gauge dependent concept except at infinity .",
    "note , that infinity in the space - time context refers to infinite large distances as well as infinitely long times .",
    "so , the unique gravitational wave information from a radiating system can be detected only at infinite distances from the system after infinitely long times .",
    "obviously , this imposes a huge burden on the numerical simulations , which can not incorporate infinite resources and , therefore , need to recourse to practical measures .",
    "this is done by imposing an outer boundary , which is considered to be ` practically ' at infinity and the gravitational field is traced along the time - like hyper - surface swept out by the boundary during the simulation .",
    "the information contained in the field near the boundary is an important ingredient in very elaborate ` extraction schemes ' which are designed to provide an approximation to the radiation field at infinity .",
    "the introduction of an artificial boundary into an infinite problem usually comes with several problems . not only is it necessary to specify boundary conditions but these should be physically reasonable and , in addition , should lead to a mathematically well - posed initial boundary value problem ( ibvp ) and a numerically stable evolution scheme .",
    "the issue of the introduction of a time - like artificial boundary is physically relevant , as was pointed out by zenginoglu  @xcite , since the decay rates of the tails are different on time - like boundaries compared to null - infinity .",
    "so one can not simply replace one with the other .",
    "in any case , introducing an artificial boundary is _ always _ an additional approximation beyond the conceptual idealisation of an isolated system .",
    "experience shows that for all practical purposes the current codes are good enough .",
    "however , from a puristic point of view the situation is still unsatisfactory . in this paper we will present the first step of a numerical approach , which will ultimately allow us to evolve space - times globally from asymptotically euclidean initial data .",
    "our method is based on the geometric description of asymptotically simple space - times developed by penrose and their analytical treatment pioneered by friedrich .    in 1965",
    ", penrose  @xcite had realised that asymptotically flat ( and , more generally , asymptotically simple ) space - times can be characterised by the fact that they have a conformal boundary , i.e. , they can be isometrically embedded into a larger lorentzian manifold after a conformal rescaling of their metric such that the boundary of the embedded manifold is given by the zero - set of the conformal factor .",
    "this means that these boundary points must be regarded as being at infinite distance from any event in the original ` physical ' space - time .    of course",
    ", such a geometric characterisation does not imply anything about the existence of general solutions of the field equations , which do in fact admit such a conformal boundary .",
    "this gap has been filled by friedrich  @xcite using what he called the conformal field equations ( cfe ) , a slight generalisation of einstein s field equations .",
    "one of his main results was the theorem on the well - posedness of the hyperboloidal initial value problem .",
    "this means that if appropriate data on a hyperboloidal initial hyper - surface are given then there exists a solution of the cfe at least for some time in the future of the initial hyper - surface .",
    "this result implies that the corresponding physical space - time admits a smooth conformal boundary , i.e. , it is asymptotically flat .",
    "if the initial data are close to minkowski data then the solution exists for such a long time that the physical space - time is in fact future complete , i.e. , it exists for all times .",
    "this semi - global existence result has been combined with a result by corvino  @xcite on the existence of asymptotically euclidean initial data with an exact schwarzschild exterior by chruciel and delay  @xcite to obtain a global existence theorem for asymptotically flat space - times .",
    "thus , penrose s conjecture on the existence of general asymptotically flat space - times has finally been settled to the affirmative .",
    "the cfe operate on the larger , conformally related ` unphysical ' manifold , within which the original ` physical ' space - time occupies a finite set .",
    "this property makes it very tempting to use the cfe for numerical simulations because they capture the entire physical space - time without the need for an artificial boundary .",
    "the feasibility of this idea has been shown in several different scenarios  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is , of course , the fact that the global physical space - time is covered by one computational domain .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we are dealing here with a conformal rescaling of the metric , so that all the causal relations and the propagation properties of the ( gravitational ) waves are identical in the physical and the conformal manifolds , see  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the conformal boundary is accessible from the conformal space - time this implies that the unique radiation data produced by the system can be read off directly on the boundary without any additional approximation .",
    "the main drawback of this approach ( apart from the increased number of unknowns ) has been the fact that the conformal factor itself is a variable in the system and , therefore , evolves .",
    "hence , its zero - set is not known beforehand ( unless one employs a particular shift gauge called ` @xmath0-freezing '  @xcite ) .",
    "it has to be located within the computational domain at each time - step in order to determine the radiation data .",
    "another issue has been the fact that initial data need to be specified on hyperboloidal hyper - surfaces .",
    "this has the consequence that only _ _",
    "pre__diction is possible but not _ _ retro__diction . also within this hyperboloidal initial value problem",
    "it is not possible to study effects of gravitational radiation coming in from null - infinity , such as for example the scattering of gravitational waves .",
    "for such questions it is necessary to include the region around space - like infinity , the avoidance of which has been the motivation for introducing hyperboloidal hyper - surfaces in the first place .",
    "we should point out that there exist other numerical approaches which are based on hyperboloidal hyper - surfaces but try to avoid the use of the full conformal field equations . in  @xcite",
    "zenginoglu describes a setup which regards the conformal factor as an external matter field coupled to the einstein equations in the conformal manifold .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor constructed from the conformal transformation properties of the einstein tensor is singular on @xmath0 but there are ways to make it regular .",
    "zenginoglu shows that in spherical symmetry one can evolve a reduced system using the so called generalised harmonic gauge .",
    "he also points out that in this approach the conformal factor is a free function and can be chosen so that it is identically equal to one inside a certain compact region , which makes the inclusion of real matter fields easier .",
    "another attempt at including null - infinity without using the conformal field equations is based on the work by moncrief and rinne  @xcite .",
    "they employ a hamiltonian framework based on conformally compactified hyperboloidal hyper - surfaces and show that the hamiltonian and momentum constraints , which are formally singular on @xmath0 , are in fact regular and can be evaluated there .",
    "they use a maximally constrained formulation for the evolution .",
    "first numerical results have been presented in  @xcite .    in  @xcite friedrich",
    "describes another set of conformal field equations , the generalised cfe ( in contrast to the earlier ` metric ' cfe ) , which can be used to study exactly the region near space - like infinity .",
    "these gcfe make full use of the conformal geometry not only on the level of the metric but also on the level of the connection .",
    "this has the important consequence that it is now possible to fix the conformal factor beforehand as a function of the coordinates so that the coordinate location of @xmath0 is known at every instant .",
    "friedrich also shows that one can ` blow up ' space - like infinity so that it is represented by a cylinder connecting past and future null - infinity .",
    "the main advantage of this new system of conformal field equations is the fact that one can employ a gauge , such that almost all the equations take the form of simple odes along the time - like coordinate vector .",
    "the only equations not of this type provide the evolution of the rescaled weyl curvature , what penrose called the gravitational field .",
    "this system is obtained from the bianchi identities and it is easily shown to be symmetric hyperbolic . the cylinder is a total characteristic for the gcfe , i.e. , the equations reduce to an intrinsic system of evolution equations on the cylinder , emphasising the sole purpose of the cylinder , namely to provide a connection between the very late ingoing radiation and the very early outgoing radiation .",
    "these properties of the gcfe call out for an attempt to use them for numerical simulations .",
    "the fixed conformal factor , the ensuing fixed location of @xmath0 in the computational domain , the fact that one can cover a neighbourhood of space - like infinity including and beyond @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the advantageous form of the evolution system are all too tempting .",
    "in fact , the first numerical application of the gcfe has been carried out by zenginoglu  @xcite ( an even earlier application of the gcfe to a different setting has been considered in @xcite ) .",
    "he was able to compute a massless axisymmetric radiative space - time in the neighbourhood of spatial infinity .",
    "however , all this comes at a price .",
    "the system of equations intrinsic to the cylinder degenerates on the locations , where the cylinder meets @xmath0 .",
    "this poses serious analytical problems because generic solutions will develop singularities there , which are expected to travel along null - infinity , thereby spoiling its smoothness and hence the concept of gravitational radiation .",
    "in addition , the numerical simulations might be affected by the degeneracies in the evolution equations .    in order to get a feeling for the possible effects we start out in this paper with a simplified situation .",
    "we study the gravitational perturbations on minkowski space - time near space - like infinity in the gauge , which exhibits the cylinder described above .",
    "this amounts to solving the linear spin-2 zero - rest - mass field equation on a particular conformally flat space - time .",
    "however , as pointed out above , this system already captures the essential properties of the full non - linear system .",
    "the equations show the exact same behaviour as the fully non - linear gcfe in the sense that they reduce to an intrinsic set of evolution equations on the cylinder and they degenerate on the intersection with null - infinity .",
    "our goal is to find out how the numerics reacts to the above mentioned degeneracies and how one can control the solutions at these locations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "in sect .  [ sec : spin-2-system ] we present the system under study . in sect .  [",
    "sec : analyt - prop ] we describe some analytical properties of the system which are relevant for the solution .",
    "[ sec : numer - impl ] contains the description of the numerical implementation and presents our results .",
    "we close the paper with a discussion in sect .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this section we derive the spin-2 zero - rest - mass equation on minkowski space - time near space - like infinity .",
    "this section follows largely the exposition in the work by friedrich  @xcite .",
    "the metric of minkowski space - time @xmath3 in cartesian coordinates @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the unit sphere metric .",
    "the exterior @xmath10 of the null - cone of the origin is given by @xmath11 . in order to focus on space - like infinity",
    "we now perform a reflection at the origin on @xmath10 by defining @xmath12 this puts the metric into the form @xmath13 this metric is singular whenever @xmath14 , i.e. , on the null - cone at infinity .",
    "so we define a conformally related metric @xmath15 which extends smoothly to the null - cone of infinity .",
    "note , that space - like infinity with respect to @xmath10 is represented in this metric as the point @xmath16 . in order to exhibit",
    "the cylindrical structure referred to above friedrich  @xcite performs a further rescaling of the metric using a function @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a smooth function with @xmath20 .",
    "the rescaled metric is defined by @xmath21 the final step is the introduction of a new time - coordinate @xmath22 by @xmath23 .",
    "this gives the final form of the metric @xmath24 note , that this metric is spherically symmetric .",
    "we write the metric   in the form @xmath25 this shows that the surfaces @xmath26 have a non - vanishing area for each value of @xmath22 and all @xmath27 . since @xmath20 this also holds for @xmath28 by continuity . in the coordinates",
    "@xmath29 the set @xmath28 is a cylinder with topology @xmath30 .",
    "the conformal factor used between the minkowski metric   and the metric   is @xmath31    -coordinate representations corresponding to @xmath32 and @xmath33,height=302 ]    let @xmath34 denote the part of the conformal space - time , which corresponds to minkowski space - time  @xmath3 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath35 consists of three parts : we have @xmath36 and we denote by @xmath37 the set @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath39 denote the regions , where @xmath37 touches @xmath40 , and @xmath41 the intersection of the hyper - surface @xmath42 with @xmath37 .",
    "we choose the function @xmath19 to be of the form @xmath43 and we will use mainly two choices for @xmath44 , namely @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) or @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) . for the first choice , @xmath0 is located at @xmath49 , while the second choice puts it onto @xmath50 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cylinder ] .    in order to get some insight into the structure near space - like infinity",
    "we introduce double null coordinates @xmath51 which puts the metric into the form @xmath52 null - infinity is characterised by the vanishing of one of the null coordinates , the other one being non - zero ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 on @xmath2 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 on @xmath1 ) .",
    "both coordinates vanish on the cylinder  @xmath37 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cylinder ] we also display the lines of constant @xmath57 and @xmath58 . since these are coordinates adapted to the conformal structure of @xmath35 we can see clearly , that the cylinder is ` invisible ' from the point of view of the conformal structure .",
    "this structure is exactly the same as the representation of space - like infinity in the coordinates @xmath59 on @xmath35 , it appears like a point .",
    "however , the differentiable structures defined by the @xmath60 and the @xmath29 coordinates are completely different near the boundary  @xmath28 .",
    "we use the spinorial form for the spin-2 zero - rest - mass field @xmath61 , see penrose and rindler  @xcite , the conventions of which ( the ghp - formalism ) we adopt throughout this work .",
    "the field equation is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the spinorial connection defined by a general @xmath64 metric @xmath65 .",
    "using the compacted spin - coefficient formalism  @xcite and defining the spinor field components @xmath66 in the usual way ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ,  ) we obtain the equations stands for the spin coefficient from the ghp formalism and is not to be confused with the function @xmath69 introduced before ( for the metric @xmath65 in eq .  ) . since ,",
    "as will see shortly , the spin coefficient @xmath69 vanishes identically under our assumptions , we continue to use the symbol @xmath69 for the function in eq .  .",
    "moreover , it should always be clear from the context whether a prime corresponds to the operator from the ghp formalism or to a radial derivative as before . ] for @xmath70 @xmath71    the metric @xmath65 in eq .",
    "is spherically symmetric . using a null - tetrad , which is adapted to this symmetry , we know immediately that all spin - coefficients with non - zero spin - weight vanish .",
    "the only non - vanishing spin - coefficients in eq .   are @xmath72 we choose the real null - vectors of the null - tetrad as @xmath73 and complement them with a complex space - like null - vector @xmath74 , which is tangent to the spheres of symmetry ; one particular choice is @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the standard polar coordinates on @xmath77 .",
    "then the relationship between the ghp - operators @xmath78 and @xmath79 and the directional derivatives @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( see  @xcite ) are mediated by the unweighted spin - coefficients @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which are @xmath84 for the metric @xmath65 . furthermore , we redefine the @xmath85 and @xmath86 operators so that they refer to the unit sphere .",
    "this is achieved by the replacement @xmath87 these new operators act on a function @xmath88 , which is defined on the unit sphere and which has spin - weight @xmath89 , by @xmath90 with these specialisations the eqs .",
    "become @xmath91 finally , we use the spherical symmetry of the background metric to expand the spinor component @xmath66 into spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath92 with @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 ,",
    "i.e. , we write for any @xmath96 @xmath97 using the properties of the unit - sphere @xmath85 and @xmath86 operators acting on spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath98 we can decouple the equations and obtain a system of pdes in @xmath99 dimensions for any admissible pair @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102 we have defined the two quantities @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we also abuse notation by omitting the superscript @xmath100 at the spinor components .",
    "thus , we have to keep in mind that we get a system like the above for every admissible pair  @xmath100 .",
    "note , however , that the for the cases @xmath105 and @xmath106 the system looks different because @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "these are advection equations along the null - directions defined by @xmath109 and @xmath110 , from which can deduce a system of evolution equations and constraint equations .",
    "before we describe the numerical implementation we want to briefly discuss some of the relevant analytical properties of this system .",
    "we first split the system into evolution equations and constraints by taking appropriate linear combinations of the equations .",
    "this yields the evolution system @xmath111 and the constraints @xmath112 obviously , the evolution equations can be written in the form @xmath113 with symmetric matrices @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "furthermore , the matrix @xmath116 is positive whenever @xmath117 .",
    "thus , the evolution equations are symmetric hyperbolic on the domain , where @xmath22 is confined to these values .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that the constraints are propagated by the evolution equations , i.e. , they propagate solutions of the constraints into solutions of the constraints : taking time derivatives of the constraint quantities @xmath118 , using the evolution equations and the constraints we obtain the ` subsidiary ' system for the propagation of the constraint quantities @xmath119 since this is a homogeneous system of ode , the claim follows immediately .",
    "the matrix on the right hand side of this equation has eigen values @xmath120 .",
    "for @xmath121 they all lie on the imaginary axis of the complex plane .",
    "so constraint violating modes due to numerical errors should not grow exponentially .",
    "it is instructive to study the behaviour of the characteristics for the evolution system .",
    "clearly , we have three different characteristics , the integral curves of the vectors @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "it is easy to see that the latter two are exactly the lines of constant @xmath57 and @xmath58 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq:8 ] , respectively , and hence , they are null . in  fig .  [",
    "fig : characteristics ] we show again the neighbourhood of @xmath37 and @xmath2 for @xmath33 .",
    "this time we show the characteristics also in the unphysical part of the diagram .    .",
    "the shaded region is the domain where the equations fail to be hyperbolic , i.e. , where @xmath125 .",
    "the corresponding neighbourhood of @xmath126 is obtained by reflection at the lower border of the diagram accompanied by an interchange of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the thick ( green ) broken line indicates the boundary of the domain of hyperbolicity ( shaded region).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the non - shaded region bounded partly by the thick broken line is the domain of hyperbolicity of the evolution equations , i.e. , the domain where @xmath127 .",
    "notice that every neighbourhood of @xmath128 contains regions where the hyperbolicity breaks down .",
    "apart from the fact that one can not hope to get existence and uniqueness of solutions beyond that region its presence also makes the numerical evolution challenging .",
    "for instance , setting up an initial boundary value problem with the left boundary at negative values of @xmath129 does not make sense if the evolution is to reach up to @xmath128 .",
    "even with the left boundary on @xmath37 it is not possible to go beyond @xmath128 since the evolution hits the non - hyperbolicity region .",
    "the constraint equations on @xmath42 are obtained from  .",
    "define @xmath130 and let @xmath131 so that @xmath132 and @xmath133 both do not vanish",
    ". then @xmath134 solutions of this system can be obtained by specifying functions @xmath135 and @xmath136 , giving initial conditions at @xmath28 and then solving the equations for the remaining components . however , for solutions with bounded derivatives at @xmath28 we can not specify these data arbitrarily .",
    "instead , for @xmath28 we have the equations @xmath137 for @xmath131 this is an inhomogeneous linear system for the components @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 with inhomogeneity given by @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "since the homogeneous system has a non - trivial solution , we can obtain solutions of the inhomogeneous system only when @xmath143 holds .",

    "one specifies the ` wave - like ' degrees of freedom represented by @xmath141 and @xmath142 and then computes from them the other components , which give rise to the energy - momentum .",
    "there is also another way to obtain initial data for the spin-2 system : we specify @xmath139 freely . when @xmath151 we use ( [ eq:13],2 ) to obtain @xmath152 and we can specify the difference @xmath153 freely . then , when @xmath131 , we can use ( [ eq:13],1,3 ) to obtain @xmath141 and @xmath142 . proceeding in this way the regularity conditions at @xmath28 are automatically satisfied .",
    "it has the advantage that no differential equations must be solved .",

    "the evolution of the spin-2 field on @xmath37 is entirely fixed by the initial data given at some initial time , say @xmath42 . the intrinsic equations ` transport ' the initial data up ( and down ) to the location where null - infinity meets the cylinder .",

    "this bundle is not trivial and hence smooth functions on @xmath315 do in general not give rise to smooth functions on @xmath364 .",
    "we can , however , choose a smooth local section in the bundle , i.e.  a smooth map @xmath367 compatible with @xmath366 where @xmath368 is an open subset of @xmath364 . with this",
    "the smooth functions @xmath92 can be pulled back to smooth functions @xmath369 defined on @xmath368 .",
    "the choice of local section made by penrose is the following .",
    "we introduce standard polar coordinates @xmath76 on @xmath364 and set @xmath370 .",
    "then , the following defines a smooth local section : @xmath371 the reader should compare this to eq .",
    "( 4.15.123 ) in @xcite : @xmath372 which is consistent . using these coordinate expressions",
    ", we can compute the functions @xmath373 as functions on @xmath364 via eq .   and then @xmath92 by eq .  .",
    "it is important to notice that while @xmath373 and @xmath92 are smooth functions on @xmath315 and their pull - backs to @xmath368 are smooth , there is in general no smooth ( not even a continuous ) extension from the dense subset @xmath368 to @xmath364 . here",
    "are some examples of explicit expressions for some harmonics @xmath374 and @xmath375 etc ."
