    "galaxy formation is currently thought to proceed via the hierarchical merging of numerous smaller substructures , which are assimilated into the host galaxies by tidal disruption and , ultimately , dissolved ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is by no means a new idea , as it was suggested by @xcite that late infall after the collapse of the initial protogalaxy was responsible for the apparent age spread among milky way ( mw ) globular clusters , and later ( by , e.g. , @xcite ) that the build - up of the galactic halo proceeds via agglomeration of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we have now seen this process in action via the numerous stellar tidal streams that have been discovered coursing through the mw s halo ( see @xcite for a summary ) and various other stellar substructures in the form of `` clouds '' of stars ( the properties of known structures are summarized in @xcite ) . in the era of large - area , deep photometric and spectroscopic surveys , we are now entering the regime where not only narrow , kinematically - cold stellar streams can be found , but also the clouds and shells of debris seen in , e.g. , the @xcite models of hierarchical formation of milky way - like galaxies . the menagerie of morphological structures predicted by these models are now being seen with deep imaging around external galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because of our perspective within the galaxy , such features are more difficult to see in context and characterize .",
    "however , a look at the variety of morphological types of known structures discussed in @xcite shows that large photometric surveys have begun finding the predicted remnants of halo assembly .",
    "the kinematical characterization of the clouds and shells that is needed to assess their origins and discern the nature of their progenitors has been more elusive , since identification of stellar members of such low surface - brightness features is difficult , and derivation of proper motions for such distant structures is challenging .",
    "the particular one of these apparent cloud - like stellar structures upon which we focus this work is the overdensity ( or , perhaps , collection of stellar excesses ) in the constellation virgo .    the first recognition of a stellar overdensity in the halo near the virgo constellation was the finding by @xcite of a cluster of 5 rr lyrae stars within @xmath10 ra @xmath11 , at a distance of @xmath1220 kpc in the first 100 deg@xmath13 results from the quest survey .",
    "shortly thereafter , @xcite used f - type turnoff starcounts on the celestial equator to identify stellar overdensities , including one at @xmath14 ra @xmath15 , dec @xmath16 that was dubbed s297 + 63 - 20.0 ( the naming scheme denotes that the feature is at @xmath17 with turnoff magnitude @xmath18 ) .",
    "this feature , which is near the same region of sky as the @xcite rr lyrae , shows a clear main sequence extending downward from @xmath19 , corresponding to a distance ( assuming an old , metal - poor population ) of @xmath20 kpc .",
    "since the distance is also similar to that of the @xcite stars , this large - area overdensity might be associated with the rr lyrae .",
    "@xcite also noted that the color of the turnoff stars in s297 + 63 - 20.0 is intermediate between that of sagittarius tidal debris and the typical mw halo turnoff , suggesting that the virgo feature is related to neither of those structures .",
    "further results from the quest survey , which studied a 2.3-degree wide strip centered at dec @xmath21 , were presented in @xcite . in the 380 deg@xmath13 portion of the quest survey discussed , the authors find 497 rr lyrae between 4 - 50 kpc .",
    "many of the distant rr lyrae are sgr debris , but the authors identify a distinct clump at mean magnitude of @xmath22 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath23 kpc . because of its location at @xmath24 , this grouping was dubbed the `` 12.4-hour clump '' . based on the rr lyrae periods and period - amplitude distributions",
    ", it appears that the clump contains rr lyrae of both oosterhoff classes , making them more typical of dwarf galaxy populations than globular clusters .",
    "this 12.4-hour clump is within the same region and at the same distance as s297 + 63 - 20.0 , which suggests an association .",
    "a `` fluff '' of overdensity was also seen in the @xcite study of 2mass - selected m - giant stars at the same position ( @xmath25 ) as s297 + 63 - 20.0 and the 12.4-hour clump , though it was suggested by those authors to be part of the `` descending , foreshortened loop '' of the sagittarius leading tidal tail .",
    "this idea was explored further by @xcite , who developed a model of the sgr disruption that produced debris at roughly the distance , position , and velocity of the @xcite rr lyrae and the @xcite main sequence detections .",
    "the first spectroscopic study of any of these overdensities came when @xcite observed 18 rr lyrae from the quest survey .",
    "their study found that a clump of stars centered at @xmath26 and @xmath27 kpc is also clustered in velocity .",
    "the six stars making up this clump have a mean @xmath28 km s@xmath2 , and a dispersion of 17.3 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this clump of stars was dubbed the `` virgo stellar stream ( vss ) '' .",
    "duffau et al .",
    "then expanded the sample to a larger area and rvs within @xmath29 of the peak , and identified 13 stars with @xmath30 km s@xmath2 with @xmath31 km s@xmath2 dispersion .",
    "these stars are spread over a distance range from @xmath32 kpc ( with one at @xmath33 kpc ) ; thus , the vss must be large and diffuse ( or contain multiple overdensities ) .",
    "the metallicity of the 7 rrab stars selected to be members is @xmath34fe / h@xmath35 \\rangle = -1.86 $ ] , with @xmath36 } = 0.4 $ ] .",
    "the large spread in conjunction with the lack of an obvious intermediate - age population in the sdss cmds is taken as evidence of a low - luminosity , old , metal - poor dwarf galaxy progenitor for the vss .",
    "further detections of halo overdensities from the quest rr lyrae survey s first catalog were presented by @xcite , who found that after removing the contribution of their best - fitting smooth halo model , the virgo structure is visible as a peak at ra@xmath37 at a distance of @xmath38 kpc ( spanning 12 - 20 kpc between @xmath39ra@xmath40 ) .",
    "velocity substructures were seen among bright ( @xmath41 ) quest rr lyrae by @xcite , including a grouping at @xmath42 kpc with @xmath43 km s@xmath2 and 25 km s@xmath2 dispersion ( plus some stars at slightly lower velocities that may also be associated with the structure ) .",
    "these stars extend the virgo substructure to more nearby distances than previously known .",
    "the mean metallicity of six of these bright rr lyrae is @xmath44fe / h@xmath35 \\rangle = -1.55 $ ] , with @xmath36}=0.15 $ ] dex .",
    "further spectroscopic data of quest rr lyrae was reported by @xcite .",
    "this study found a vss grouping with 23 members , having a mean rv of @xmath45 km s@xmath2 .",
    "there are additional stars in a group at higher ( @xmath46 km",
    "s@xmath2 ) velocity , but slightly more nearby ( 9 - 15 kpc ) .",
    "these , together with the 10 - 12 kpc @xmath47 km s@xmath2 stars from @xcite suggest a velocity gradient with distance in the vss region .        & & & & & & + & & & & & & +    vivas et al .",

    "the authors claim that becuase vss stars have been found between 12 - 24 kpc with a large metallicity spread , we must be looking at the remains of a disrupted dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",

    "@xcite studied virgo using sdss starcounts of bhb stars , blue stragglers , and f - turnoff stars as well as segue radial velocities of f - type turnoff stars in the region of the virgo overdensity .",
    "the authors showed using bhb stars and blue stragglers within 15 kpc of the sgr orbital plane that sgr debris in this region does not pass through the position of s297 + 63 - 20.5 identified by @xcite , ruling out the association of the virgo structure with leading - arm sgr debris . since the sdss footprint by dr5 covered the entire north galactic cap ( ngc ) , newberg et al .",
    "were able to make starcount maps of the ngc using photometrically - selected f - turnoff stars .",
    "these maps showed that the virgo ( s297 + 63 - 20.5 ) structure is prominent mostly at magnitudes @xmath68 , spanning at least @xmath69 across .",

    "@xcite undertook a spectroscopic survey of 111 faint ( @xmath73 ) , blue ( @xmath74 ) turnoff candidates centered on the vss , the majority of which seem to be sagittarius leading arm stars .",

    "we note also that the mean and dispersion quoted by @xcite was measured using only stars between @xmath76 km s@xmath2 , but there is a long tail of stars at higher velocities in their sample .",
    "the final spectroscopic study we mention is that of @xcite .",
    "these authors observed a sample of 178 k - giant stars in four separate fields between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "in addition to a clear signal from the sagittarius tidal tail at @xmath79 km s@xmath2 , they found a significant excess of high - velocity ( @xmath80 km s@xmath2 ) stars .",
    "the authors suggest that these @xmath20-kpc - distant stars may be two separate features ( denoted `` feature b '' and `` feature c '' ) with @xmath81 km s@xmath2 .",
    "another sdss study by @xcite explored the photometric properties of the overdensity in virgo .",
    "the prominent factor of @xmath82 stellar excess spanning over 1000 deg@xmath13 in this study was dubbed the `` virgo overdensity ( vod ) '' by the authors .",
    "the vod extends from the lower limit of the sdss footprint at @xmath83 kpc above the galactic plane to the outer limit of their study at @xmath84 kpc , suggesting that it may extend even farther .",
    "the feature appears to narrow at higher @xmath85 , which suggests that it may extend further into ( or beyond ) the plane . assuming a distance of 10 kpc and 1000 deg@xmath13 area , @xcite estimated a lower limit on the total luminosity of @xmath86 , or @xmath87 .",
    "the color - color distribution of vod stars suggests that the vod is more metal - poor than the thick disk",
    ". however , juric et al .",
    "( as well as @xcite previously ) see the vod in 2mass - selected m giants , so there must also be a relatively metal - rich population associated with the vod as well .",
    "again , because of its low surface brightness , large extent , well - defined outline , and low metallicity , the authors argue that the vod is the result of a low - metallicity dwarf galaxy merging with the milky way .",
    "additional work using sdss - derived photometric metallicity estimates by @xcite explored the entire ngc region .",
    "the vod in the region between @xmath88 and @xmath89 was found by these authors to have median metallicity of [ fe / h]=-2.0@xmath900.1 .",
    "note , however , that this is for _ all _ dwarf stars in this region , only some of which are vod members .",
    "claim that the fact that the median [ fe / h ] derived is the same as the halo metallicity in the symmetric area of the sky means that the additional vod stars are halo - like .    using sdss photometrically - selected sub - giants",
    ", @xcite mapped the north galactic cap , and resolved the vod into a number of discrete overdensities of smaller area than that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a similar result using combined sekbo rr lyrae data and sdss photometry .",
    "the vod appears to break up into at least three distinct clumps in that study .",
    "this may suggest significant inhomogeneity across the larger @xmath91 deg@xmath13 feature of @xcite .",
    "a summary of the numerous detections of stellar overdensities in virgo discussed in this section is given in table  [ tab : litdata ] . from this table , it is obvious that there is a large complex of structures in this part of the sky detected using a variety of stellar tracers , that ( based on their similar distances and velocities ) may be related to each other .",
    "each of the surveys presents a data set limited either in its spatial coverage or based on a modest - sized sample of spectra , making interpretation difficult .    understanding the nature of the virgo overdensities and their possible inter - relationship",
    "will ultimately require measurement of the kinematics and/or chemistry of large numbers of stars in the large area where overdensities have been detected .",
    "in contrast , we focus on a small region of sky , but where we can take advantage of precise measurements of three - dimensional kinematics of selected virgo candidates .",
    "this study is a follow - up to that of @xcite ( 2009 ; hereafter cd09 ) , which presented the orbit of a single rr lyrae consistent with membership in a virgo substructure .",
    "this star had radial velocity measurements from sdss and proper motion measurements from photographic plate data derived from the survey of kapteyn s selected areas described initially by @xcite .",
    "the 3-d kinematics of this particular star place it ( and , by inference , the substructure of which it is part ) on a highly eccentric orbit , having just passed its pericenter .",
    "the authors considered possible positional associations with milky way satellites beyond galactic radii of 50 kpc , and found that the unusual globular cluster ngc 2419 is within 13 kpc of the derived orbit .",
    "the present study revisits the result of cd09 using spectra for additional stars from the same proper - motion catalog used in the cd09 study .",
    "we spectroscopically identify 16 virgo members , from which we derive mean proper motions and rvs . from these",
    ", we derive an orbit for the virgo substructure , and use this orbit to produce @xmath8-body models based on the measured kinematics .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we discuss the data used for this study , which include proper motions from the selected areas survey , sdss photometry , and low - resolution spectroscopy obtained on three separate observing runs .",
    "section 3 outlines the methods we used to select virgo substructure members , and compares our data sets to sdss data from the surrounding regions of sky .",
    "the criteria adopted to identify virgo structure members were based on radial velocity , color - magnitude location , proper motion , and to some extent metallicity , yielding a final sample of 16 virgo members .",
    "we follow this , in section 4 , with analysis of the kinematics derived from the identified members .",
    "we derive an orbit based on the mean motion we measure , and use this to generate an @xmath8-body simulation that roughly reproduces the ( still poorly - known ) characteristics of the virgo substructure(s ) . in section 5",
    ", we search for positional and kinematical associations of known milky way satellites and substructures with our derived orbit for virgo debris , and discuss a few possible associations . in particular , our data and subsequent simulations suggest plausible associations of the virgo debris with ngc 2419 , the pisces overdensity , the @xcite 90-kpc `` sgr debris '' , and a stellar overdensity in the field of view of the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy segue 1 .",
    "we conclude by arguing that we have convincingly shown that all or most of the known virgo overdensities are plausibly part of a single disrupted dwarf galaxy , and that a number of other milky way substructures may be associated with this same progenitor .",
    "proper motions used in this study come from the survey described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cd06 ) ; we provide a brief introduction here , and refer the reader to for details .",
    "the survey consists of @xmath1250 fields of @xmath0 spaced @xmath92 degrees apart in strips along the celestial equator ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 ( see fig .  1 in for a map ) .",
    "these fields are the `` selected areas ( sas ) '' designated by @xcite for his proposed comprehensive study of the milky way .",
    "the particular field of view in this study , sa  103 , was also the focus of a previous publication ( ) .",
    "sa  103 is centered at @xmath95 , or @xmath96 .",
    "the photographic plates making up our earliest epoch for proper motions were originally taken between 1909 - 1912 ( analysis of photometry from these plates appears in @xcite ) as part of the kapteyn survey at the mt .",
    "wilson 60-inch . matching plates ( in field of view , depth , and plate scale ) were taken by s.  majewski between 1996 - 1998 at the las campanas du pont 2.5-meter telescope to provide a @xmath97-year baseline for measurement of proper motions .",
    "wilson 60-inch plates have plate scale @xmath98 mm@xmath2 , and the plate scale for du  pont 2.5-meter data is @xmath99 mm@xmath2 , with both having a field of view of @xmath100 .",
    "all of these plates were digitized using the yale pds microdensitometer .",
    "the data were supplemented by intermediate - epoch plates from the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - i ) , taken in the early 1950s , to extend the limiting magnitude of our proper motions beyond the depth provided by the mt .",
    "wilson plates .",
    "proper motions were measured by comparing the positions of objects on 1 mt .  wilson plate , 4 poss - i plates , and 2 du  pont plates .",
    "each of the mt .",
    "wilson and du  pont plates contain a long and short exposure offset spatially , providing 2 measurements per plate .",
    "two separate scans of the poss - i plates were analyzed ; one from the pmm measuring engine at usno , and the other from the pds microdensitometer at stsci .",
    "thus there is a total of 14 possible measurements from the 7 plates in sa  103 .",
    "the correction from relative to absolute proper motions was done using four qsos and 302 background galaxies in the field of view ( see for details ) , from which we derived zero points of @xmath101 cos @xmath102 mas yr@xmath2 and @xmath103 mas yr@xmath2 ; these were applied to the data to place the proper motions in an absolute frame .",
    "qsos are taken from sdss qso catalogs , and galaxies are identified in the plate scans .",
    "proper motion uncertainties range from @xmath104 mas yr@xmath2 per star at the bright end ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) to 2 - 3 mas yr@xmath2 at the faint ( @xmath106 ) , limiting magnitude of the plates .    rather than relying on photographic photometry",
    ", we took advantage of the fact that high - quality photometry from sdss dr7 was available for the sa  103 area .",
    "the photometric data we have used throughout this work are corrected for reddening and extinction ( from @xcite , the mean reddening is e(b - v ) = 0.026 along this line of sight ) . by comparison of photometric catalogs to the much deeper sdss data",

    "indeed , the three fields at @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( the bottom panels in figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) look similar to each other , but the sa  103 field of view ( the upper right panel ) shows a clear main sequence extending downward from @xmath120 . within the overplotted box at @xmath121 and @xmath122 , there are a total of 93 , 130 , 85 , and 183 stars for @xmath123 respectively . these correspond to fractions of 0.123 , 0.125 , 0.106 , and 0.142 of the total number of stars above the dashed line ( i.e. , with @xmath124 ) in each panel of figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "we thus conclude that the apparent clumping of stars at @xmath125 and @xmath121 in our sa  103 proper motion data near @xmath126 is due to a significant stellar excess that is present along this line of sight . based on these starcounts",
    "we surmise that @xmath127 of the stars in this cmd - selection region are part of the virgo substructure .     with output of the besanon model along the same line of sight ( upper middle panel ) and",

    "should be roughly equal at each longitude .",
    "we find a total of 183 stars within the cmd - selection box in the upper - right panel ( corresponding to sa  103 ) , well above the totals of 93 , 130 , and 85 that are found in each of the fields at @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "when we instead consider the fraction of the total number of stars above the dashed line that are within the boxed region , we find 0.123 , 0.125 , 0.106 , and 0.142 for @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "we posit that this excess over the number of stars in symmetric fields ( all selected from data of equal quality and depth ) signals the presence of a significant overdensity ( comprising @xmath135 of the stars in the boxed region ) in sa  103.,height=432 ]      in figure  [ fig : cmd ] there is no obvious red giant branch associated with the msto feature , meaning that spectroscopic follow - up aimed at efficiently identifying and measuring the kinematics of virgo substructure members should ideally focus on the high - density turnoff region . however , many of the spectra we observed for this study were taken as backup targets during observing time scheduled for other projects . thus the spectroscopic targets , shown as large colored circles in figure  [ fig : cmdspectra ] , are not optimally selected and tend to sample brighter magnitudes",
    "the box overplotted in figure  [ fig : cmdspectra ] ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ; the same as in figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) surrounds the apparent msto of the virgo structure , and thus contains the best spectroscopic candidates .",

    "thus the chi - square test was rerun with an additional element , labeled `` segue 1b '' , to distinguish it from the main segue 1 population .",
    "the segue 1b stars are an excellent match to our orbit in all three spatial dimensions ( within 1.3 kpc ) , and offset from the best matching point by only @xmath244 km s@xmath2 in radial velocity .",
    "the pisces overdensity was first found by @xcite as an overdensity ( dubbed `` structure  j '' ) of distant rr lyrae stars in sdss stripe 82 .",

    "however , we will show that a simple model based on our precise kinematics explains nearly all of the observed properties .    to understand the orbital dynamics of the virgo substructure progenitor more clearly",
    ", semi - analytical @xmath8-body simulations were generated using our derived orbit .",
    "the kinematical parameters determined for virgo debris in sa  103 were used to generate orbital models using the same gravitational potential as the test particle orbit .",
    "the simulation templates used were 10,000 particle plummer spheres placed on our derived orbit for the virgo structure .",
    "the satellites were evolved in the galactic potential for 3 - 4 gyr using the gyrfalcon tool of the nemo stellar dynamics toolbox ( @xcite ) , and their ending time tailored to place the core of the progenitor near the current vod .",
    "this strategy of placing the progenitor ( or its remains ) at the position of the vod is motivated by our derived orbit .",
    "pile - ups of tidal debris are typically located at the apo- or peri - center of a satellite s orbit ; however , we showed in the previous section that our measured kinematics place virgo substructure stars at an orbital phase just past pericenter .",
    "thus , in order to have a cloud - like pile - up of stars at the vod position ( i.e. , at an orbital phase that is _ not _ at peri- or apo - center ) , the stellar overdensity is likely the remains of the progenitor itself .    because the progenitor of the virgo structure is unknown ( if it even still exists )",
    ", we must explore the behavior of disrupting satellites of different masses .",
    "initially , we placed a globular - cluster - sized object with @xmath253 and plummer radius @xmath254 pc on our derived orbit . on the eccentric orbit derived for virgo stars",
    ", the globular cluster is rapidly shredded upon its pericentric passage .",
    "the @xmath8-body results of this globular cluster progenitor are seen in figure  [ fig : glob ] , which focuses on the region of sky around sa  103 .",
    "the satellite is already extended into a narrow tidal stream after its first perigalactic passage ( in the upper panel ) , and is completely disrupted by around 3 to 4 gyr , corresponding to the third perigalactic passage .",
    "this creates a narrow , well defined stream in the sky , contrary to observations of a large cloud - like feature seen in virgo .",
    "we note also that remnants of disrupted globular clusters are typically rather kinematically cold ; the absence of a narrow velocity peak among the virgo substructure data thus also argues against a globular cluster progenitor .",
    "therefore , a globular cluster - like object is unlikely to be the progenitor of the substructure(s ) in virgo .",
    "having ruled out a globular cluster as the virgo substructure progenitor , we then tried a larger , more massive dwarf galaxy - like satellite . specifically , we first simulated a dsph of mass similar to that derived by @xcite for the orphan stream progenitor ( @xmath255 ) , configured in a plummer sphere of radius @xmath256 kpc .",
    "this low - mass dwarf galaxy was run through an @xmath8-body simulation with the same mw parameters as the globular cluster model , on our derived virgo substructure orbit . as with the globular cluster ,",
    "the orphan - like progenitor disrupts quickly on this destructive orbit .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : orphan ] , this comparatively kinematically `` warmer '' object dissolves much more rapidly than the globular cluster .",
    "the remnant becomes more `` puffy '' than the disrupted globular cluster , but still remains embedded in a narrow stream .",
    "this more closely resembles what is seen in virgo , and suggests that an even larger , more massive dsph may produce a large - area , cloud - like overdensity when disrupted on this orbit .",

    "darker areas contain more f turnoff stars . comparing this figure to the left panel",
    ", one can see an apparent agreement between the observed location of the virgo debris and that predicted by the n - body model .",
    "the virgo overdensity is visible at the lower right edge of the data in the right panel .",
    ", width=268 ]    finally , we simulated a 10,000 particle , sagittarius - sized template dwarf galaxy ( a plummer sphere with mass of @xmath261 and scale radius @xmath262 kpc ) on the virgo test - particle orbit .",
    "the results of this gravitational @xmath8-body simulation are displayed in figures  [ fig : sgrlb ] ( spatial distribution ) , [ fig : sgrvd ] ( @xmath157 and distance vs. longitude ) , and [ fig : sgrlbpolar ] ( polar projection of the spatial positions ) .",
    "the disruption of a sgr - sized object on this orbit produces several structures that span large ( hundreds of square degree ) areas of the sky ( figure  [ fig : sgrlb ] ) .",
    "the large , diffuse overdensities centered at @xmath263 and @xmath264 are the results of tidal debris piling up at apogalacticon . these distant debris ( at @xmath265 and @xmath266 kpc , respectively ;",
    "see figure  [ fig : sgrvd ] ) piling up at the turning points of the disrupting dsph s orbit are expected for an object on such a radial , destructive orbit ( see , e.g. , the `` umbrella - like '' structures in @xcite ) .",
    "one may expect a dsph seen shortly after a perigalactic passage to have a distorted morphology with well - defined tidal tails emanating from it .",
    "however , the @xmath8-body model guided by our precise kinematics of virgo stars shows that the large tidal shock imparted to a sgr - like progenitor upon its passage @xmath267 kpc from the galactic center causes the dsph to inflate to an apparent size ( at @xmath268 kpc ) of hundreds of square degrees ( note that we are not concerning ourselves about whether the particles are bound to the progenitor at this stage ; most of the stars must be unbound at this point in the object s evolution ) .",
    "this is seen more clearly in the left panel of figure  [ fig : sgrlbpolar ] , which shows a polar plot of @xmath8-body model debris in galactic coordinates , centered on the north galactic pole . given for comparison in the right panel of figure  [ fig : sgrlbpolar ]",
    "is a reproduction of figure 5 from @xcite , in which the virgo substructure is clearly seen as an overdensity of photometrically - selected f - turnoff stars from sdss .",
    "the progenitor ( or its remains ) in our model spans roughly the same area as the overdensity seen by newberg et al .",
    ", centered on the same position , including possibly an elongated shape along galactic latitude ( i.e. , from left to right in the figure ) .",
    "this structure , seen at roughly the position of sa 103 ( denoted by the large black dot in figure  [ fig : sgrlb ] at @xmath269 , or @xmath270 ) and spanning @xmath271 square degrees , contains @xmath272 of the original 10,000 particles making up the progenitor .",
    "since the progenitor had a mass of @xmath273 , this corresponds to a mass of @xmath274 in the area surrounding the remains of the progenitor . as an exercise",
    ", we estimate the luminosity corresponding to this mass by assuming a mass - to - light ratio typical of milky way dsphs ,-",
    "body particles to the observed stellar overdensity . ]",
    "( @xmath275 ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ; this yields a @xmath276-band absolute magnitude of @xmath277 ( or @xmath278 , respectively , for @xmath279 ) .",
    "this compares favorably to the estimate of the total integrated light of the vod by @xcite in a 760 deg@xmath13 area of @xmath280 ( or @xmath281 using the more nearby @xcite distances ) .",
    "@xcite found a total @xmath282band luminosity of @xmath283 , or @xmath87 , for the overdensity assuming a distance of 10 kpc and 1000 deg@xmath13 area .",
    "thus , the remains of the virgo progenitor as determined by our derived orbit are consistent with the observed stellar overdensity that covers hundreds of square degrees .",
    "another mystery surrounding the numerous overdensities detected in virgo is the disagreement among radial velocities between studies of debris at different positions . as we showed in section [ section : candidates ] , even in sa  103 , which spans only @xmath284 , there is a significant excess of high-@xmath157 stars that forms a broad peak ( see figure  [ fig : sa103histvgsr ] ) .",
    "this is more obvious among sdss rvs shown in figure  [ fig : dr8histvgsr ]  a broad excess relative to the besanon model is apparent at @xmath285 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this is much too broad to be the signature of a kinematically - cold tidal stream .",
    "if the vod were due to the piling up of tidal debris at the apocenter of a satellite orbit , then a large velocity dispersion could be expected ; however , the mean velocity at such a turnaround point must be @xmath159 km s@xmath2 rather than @xmath286 km s@xmath2 as observed . furthermore , we have shown that stars in the virgo substructure are not at apogalacticon , having rather just passed their _ peri-_galacticon .",
    "examination of the upper panel of figure  [ fig : sgrvd ] , however , shows that our @xmath8-body model offers an explanation for the large spread in velocity of virgo debris .",
    "the progenitor , having just experienced a close encounter with the galactic center , has been kinematically heated so that its velocity dispersion has increased to @xmath20 km s@xmath2 or more and its rvs span @xmath232 km s@xmath2 .",
    "note that the model seen in figure  [ fig : sgrvd ] does not predict debris with @xmath287 km s@xmath2 near the progenitor , as is seen in both the sa  103 data ( figure  [ fig : sa103histvgsr ] ) and sdss ( figure  [ fig : dr8histvgsr ] ) as a long tail to high velocities .",
    "it is possible that additional substructure is present in this region of the sky . alternatively",
    ", this long tail may be a feature of the disrupting virgo progenitor that our simple model has not addressed ",
    "further modeling exploring the progenitor s mass and mass distribution may be able to reproduce this feature .",
    "to summarize , our @xmath8-body model of a sagittarius - sized dwarf galaxy with mean kinematics of the 16 stars we determined to be virgo substructure members qualitatively reproduces many of the observed properties of the stellar excess in virgo .",
    "we have shown that a large , cloud - like stellar structure like that in virgo is likely to have originated in the tidal disruption of a massive dwarf galaxy .",
    "no dwarf galaxies are found along the integrated path of the orbit we have derived , leading us to conclude that the virgo substructure is itself the remains of the progenitor . the slight mismatch in the position of the disrupted progenitor in our model and that of the observed overdensity in virgo is a consequence of the model runtime and our lack of knowledge of the central position of the stellar overdensity , which may lie outside the observed sdss footprint .",
    "details such as the size of the overdensity and the direction of its elongation may also be slightly discrepant between the model and observations , but are in rough qualitative agreement .",
    "many of these differences are likely due to the fact that the initial conditions used to generate the model ",
    "namely , the kinematics of debris in sa  103  may not actually correspond to the center of the progenitor .",
    "a more comprehensive exploration of parameter space ( including , but not limited to , the mass of the progenitor , its position , and its initial density configuration ) could likely resolve some of these issues , but is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "it is clear , however , that the morphology , spatial extent , luminosity , and large velocity dispersion of the observations are all qualitatively consistent with our simple model .",
    "we thus suggest that a massive dwarf galaxy was the progenitor of the substructure in virgo .",
    "in section [ subsection : orbit ] we discussed a search for milky way satellites and stellar overdensities that may be associated with the virgo substructure . while initially the search was conducted in hopes of identifying the progenitor of the vod , our modeling results suggest that the vod itself is likely the remains of the progenitor . however , the infalling dwarf spheroidal that produced the vod may have had satellites of its own , similar to the globular clusters associated with the sgr and fornax dsphs .",
    "if the progenitor had globular clusters orbiting in its potential , these should be found along the orbit of the progenitor .",
    "also , since the vod is near the pericenter of the progenitor s rather destructive orbit , there should be additional tidal debris that has collected at the apogalactica of the orbit , as seen in figures  [ fig : sgrlb ] and [ fig : sgrvd ] . in this subsection , we revisit the satellites and stellar substructures we identified in section [ subsection : associations ] , and discuss them in the context of the @xmath8-body model results .      the distant milky way globular cluster ngc 2419 was suggested by cd09 to be plausibly associated with their orbit of the vss based on a single rr lyrae star .",
    "the orbit passes near ngc 2419 at the next apocenter ahead of the virgo substructure along its orbit .",
    "the cluster has a radial velocity of @xmath288 km s@xmath2 , which , because it is close to zero , is consistent with ngc  2419 being at the turnaround point of its orbit .",
    "we find that our orbit does not reach the @xmath289 kpc distance of ngc  2419 , instead turning around at @xmath266 kpc at its nearest apocenter .",
    "however , within the uncertainties on the orbital parameters ( as illustrated by the different orbits in figure  [ fig : xy ] with kinematics selected from within the @xmath290 uncertainties ) , the orbit could plausibly be associated with a satellite or debris at such distances .",
    "ngc  2419 is an unusually large , luminous globular cluster , which has led to speculation that it is actually the stripped core of a former dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one might thus suggest ngc  2419 to be the progenitor of the virgo substructure .",
    "we believe this is unlikely , because ngc  2419 has a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = -2.1 @xcite , making it more metal - poor than the debris we have studied in sa  103 , and even more deficient than the rr lyrae studies have found for vod / vss stars .",
    "because metallicity gradients in dwarf galaxies lead to more metal - rich populations being concentrated at their cores , tidal streams from disrupted dsphs should have mean metallicities that decrease with distance along the stream from the progenitor ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is hard to imagine how , if ngc 2419 is the progenitor , it could have a mean metallicity lower than that of all known debris .",
    "it is also possible that the cluster fell in with the ( dwarf - galaxy ) progenitor .",
    "however , we note that @xcite pointed out that the globular clusters associated with dwarf galaxies are faint relative to the general globular cluster population ; this would appear to rule out the extremely luminous ngc  2419 as a globular - cluster companion of an infalling dwarf galaxy .",
    "furthermore , @xcite identified an overdensity of a - type ( primarily bhb ) stars at a mean distance of 83 kpc spanning over 200 deg@xmath13 in the region surrounding ngc  2419 .",
    "very few bhb stars should be present that far out in the halo , and it was originally suggested by newberg et al . that these stars are sagittarius tidal debris . in our @xmath8-body model of the virgo progenitor ,",
    "the position of the @xcite stars on the sky is consistent with the collection of virgo - structure stars at the apocenter of its orbit .",
    "we note that the @xmath8-body model produces debris about 40% closer than either ngc  2419 or the newberg et al .",
    "stars , but this is not troubling .",
    "the orbit traverses distances consistent with both ngc  2419 and the a - star overdensity , and we have seen that @xmath8-body models using slightly different kinematics ( from within our error distribution ) would produce model debris at those distances as well .",
    "we thus suggest that ngc  2419 and the `` cloud '' of a stars nearby it may be associated with the virgo progenitor .",
    "another of the close matches to our orbit is the dwarf galaxy segue 1 , which lies directly along the path of the virgo structure orbit .",
    "however , we are not suggesting here that the extremely metal - poor , dark matter - dominated segue 1 dsph is associated with the virgo structure .",
    "instead , it is the `` extra '' radial velocity peak identified by ( * ? ? ? * with 4 stars ) , later seen more strongly by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stars ) , and finally detected with 24 stars by @xcite that we believe to be tidal debris from the virgo system . because the spectroscopic targets were selected by simon et al . to be consistent with the segue 1 distance ( @xmath291 kpc ) ,",
    "the stars in the additional rv peak are presumably at roughly this same distance ( @xcite quote a distance of @xmath292 kpc ) . however , their mean velocity is at @xmath293  km  s@xmath2 , offset by @xmath232  km  s@xmath2 from the segue 1 velocity .",
    "our @xmath8-body model predicts virgo debris should be present at this position ( @xmath294 ) at a distance of @xmath295 kpc ( see figures  [ fig : sgrlb ] and [ fig : sgrvd ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the upper panel of figure  [ fig : sgrvd ] shows that the debris in our model is at @xmath296 km s@xmath2 , or almost exactly where the 24 `` excess '' stars in the @xcite study appear .",
    "we therefore conclude that the debris in the segue 1 field of view is plausibly associated with the virgo stream system .",
    "we note also that the mean metallicity is suggested by @xcite to be [ fe / h ] = -1.3 for these 24 stars in the `` 300 km s@xmath2 stream '' .",
    "this is consistent with the metallicity we have measured for debris in sa 103 .",
    "lending further credence to our claim of an association with the stream from the virgo progenitor is the fact that both @xcite and niederste - ostholt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) see an east - west extension of the 300 km s@xmath2 stream stars .",
    "in fact , figure 8b of @xcite shows the stars in this velocity feature to possibly be oriented along a southeast - to - northwest direction , which is exactly the orientation of the debris from our model of the virgo progenitor .",
    "based on all these facts taken together , we believe that the 300 km s@xmath2 stream in the segue 1 field of view is debris associated with the virgo substructure .      finally , we note that the `` pisces overdensity '' , a stellar excess spanning a large area on the sky at a galactocentric distance of @xmath297 kpc @xcite , is located at the position and distance of the most recent apocenter of our virgo orbit .",
    "this overdensity was first found among rr lyrae in sdss stripe 82 data at @xmath298 , or @xmath299 , and subsequently seen to stretch to @xmath300 in 2mass - selected m - giant stars @xcite .",
    "examination of figures  [ fig : sgrlb ] and [ fig : sgrvd ] shows a pile - up of model debris at the position and near the distance roughly corresponding to the pisces overdensity .",
    "this is also illustrated in the polar view of model debris in the southern galactic cap seen in figure  [ fig : sgrlbpolarsouth ] , which overplots the approximate location of the pisces overdensity atop our model . because this substructure has been detected in metal - poor rr lyrae @xcite as well as relatively metal - rich 2mass - selected m - giant stars @xcite , it has already been suggested to be related to a dwarf - galaxy disruption event .",
    "it is therefore remarkable that our @xmath8-body model for a disrupting dsph on the virgo orbit predicts just such a `` cloud '' of tidal debris as has been observed .",
    "the radial velocity one would expect at the turnaround point of the orbit is @xmath301 km s@xmath2 , with some large spread about zero velocity due to the viewing angle roughly along the path of both the outward - streaming and inward - bound debris ( see figure  [ fig : sgrvd ] for an illustration of the large range of expected @xmath157 in a @xmath302 range of galactic longitude ) .",
    "spectroscopy of rr lyrae in the pisces structure by @xcite was combined with additional spectra by @xcite to arrive at a sample of 12 rr lyrae in the overdensity .",
    "these 12 stars separate into two distinct peaks at @xmath303 km s@xmath2 with @xmath304 km s@xmath2 , and @xmath305 km s@xmath2 , @xmath306 km s@xmath2 . @xcite",
    "considered the possibility that the two groups are drawn from the same gaussian distribution , and concluded that the hypothesis of normality can be rejected at the @xmath307 level . however , from the small number of stars , it is unclear whether the two rv peaks correspond to approaching and receding portions of the same tidal stream , or separate substructures .",
    "however , it is reasonable to conclude that either ( or perhaps both ) of these velocities are consistent with debris from the virgo progenitor as modeled by us .",
    "we note , though , that @xcite find that although the two velocity groups are centered at roughly the same positions , one of the stars in the negative - velocity group extends to lower right ascension .",
    "similarly , in figures 12 and 14 of @xcite the pisces overdensity appears to be closer at lower ra ( and lower galactic longitude ) than at its peak . both of these findings are consistent with our tidal stream model , wherein the debris on the lower - longitude side of the apogalacticon is on the approaching portion of the stream .",
    "we conclude that it is likely that the pisces overdensity has its origin in the disruption of the virgo progenitor",
    ". however , further observations and detailed modeling of both the virgo and pisces structures are needed to confirm this .",
    "we have presented 3-d kinematics of candidate virgo substructure members in sa  103 , a @xmath0 field located at ( @xmath308 , or @xmath309 .",
    "this work builds upon that of , in which an orbit was presented for a single vss rr  lyrae candidate from the sa  103 data set .",
    "we have obtained follow - up spectra of a total of 215 stars from the kapteyn s selected areas proper motion survey outlined in @xcite . from the derived radial velocities , we isolate an excess of relatively high - velocity stars that are unexpected from smooth milky way populations .",
    "these stars , at @xmath310 km s@xmath2 , do not make up a kinematically cold `` peak '' in the rvs , but rather span nearly the entire high - velocity range .",
    "however , we show that the proper motions of most of the stars from these high velocities are consistent with their being kinematically associated . furthermore , these high - velocity stars inhabit regions of the color - magnitude diagram that place them all at nearly the same distance , @xmath311 kpc , from the sun .",
    "we identify a total of 16 candidate virgo substructure members , from which we derive a weighted mean radial velocity @xmath312 km s@xmath2 and proper motion @xmath313 mas yr@xmath2 .",
    "the mean metallicity of the substructure is estimated to be [ fe / h ] @xmath12 -1.1 . from the mean kinematics and the derived distance of @xmath3 kpc",
    ", we generate an orbit in a model galactic potential .",
    "the virgo substructure stars are on an eccentric orbit ( @xmath314 ) with peri- and apo - centers of @xmath217  kpc and @xmath216  kpc , respectively .",
    "we searched for satellites or known overdensities that can plausibly be associated with the virgo progenitor . based on the positions and radial velocities of the derived orbit",
    ", we find that known tidal debris in the field of view of the ultra - faint dwarf segue  i match our predicted orbit in position and velocity .",
    "while it is intriguing to find such a close match to the predicted path and kinematics of the virgo progenitor orbit , one must explain the fact that the 24 stars making up the `` 300  km  s@xmath2 debris '' near segue  i were found by @xcite to have a velocity dispersion of only 7.0  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "it is possible that these stars near segue  i , as well as many of the apparently cold stellar substructures in virgo , are kinematically cold sub - clumps within the virgo debris . another plausible match to our derived orbit is the globular cluster ngc  2419 .",
    "this distant cluster was suggested by to be associated with the virgo substructure , possibly as its progenitor .",
    "it is difficult to explain how the metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = -2.1 ) ngc  2419 could have been the origin of the more metal - rich virgo debris ; rather , it is more likely that ngc  2419 fell into the milky way with the virgo progenitor .",
    "we also note that there is a known overdensity of a - stars found by @xcite to span @xmath47 deg@xmath13 around ngc  2419 at a mean distance of 83 kpc .",
    "this cloud of stars may be associated with ngc  2419 , the virgo progenitor , or both .    through the use of @xmath8-body models of satellites on this rather destructive orbit ,",
    "we show that the large spatial extent of the virgo substructure does not arise if the progenitor of the stellar overdensity was a globular cluster or low - mass dwarf galaxy .",
    "rather , the progenitor of the virgo structure must have been a massive , sagittarius - like dwarf spheroidal galaxy of mass @xmath315 .",
    "the @xmath8-body model of a sgr - mass dsph on our derived orbit qualitatively reproduces the observed spatial extent , velocity spread , and estimated stellar mass of the virgo overdensity .",
    "we thus conclude that the entire cloud - like virgo substructure is likely the tidal debris remnant from a recently - disrupted dwarf galaxy .",
    "our model also produces a `` cloud '' of debris near the position and distance of ngc  2419 ( and the surrounding a - star overdensity ) , corresponding to the apocenter of the orbit .",
    "another diffuse overdensity is predicted by the model near the location of the pisces overdensity , suggesting that the pisces stars may have originated in the virgo progenitor .",

    "<S> we present three - dimensional space velocities of stars selected to be consistent with membership in the virgo stellar substructure . </S>",

    "<S> the signature of the virgo substructure is clear in the sdss color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) centered on sa  103 , and 16 stars are identified that have high galactocentric - frame radial velocities ( @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) and lie near the cmd locus of virgo . </S>",

    "<S> we derive mean kinematics from these 16 stars , finding a radial velocity @xmath4 km s@xmath2 and proper motions @xmath5 mas yr@xmath2 . from the mean kinematics of these members , we determine that the virgo progenitor was on an eccentric ( @xmath6 ) orbit that recently passed near the galactic center ( pericentric distance @xmath7 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> this destructive orbit is consistent with the idea that the substructure(s ) in virgo originated in the tidal disruption of a milky way satellite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8-body simulations suggest that the entire cloud - like virgo substructure ( encompassing the `` virgo overdensity '' and the `` virgo stellar stream '' ) is likely the tidal debris remnant from a recently - disrupted massive ( @xmath9 ) dwarf galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the model also suggests that some other known stellar overdensities in the milky way halo ( e.g. , the pisces overdensity and debris near ngc  2419 and segue  1 ) are explained by the disruption of the virgo progenitor . </S>"
