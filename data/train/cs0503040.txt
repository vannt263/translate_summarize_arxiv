    "in @xcite , we studied the uplink user capacity in a two - tier cdma system composed of a single macrocell within which a single microcell is embedded .",
    "this system assumed that all users transmit over the same set of frequencies , with handoff between tiers .",
    "analytical techniques were developed to both exactly compute and accurately approximate the user capacity supported in such a two - tier system . here , we implement these techniques to study a particular kind of single - macrocell / single - microcell system . specifically , we consider a wireless data system where the microcell is designed to attract only a small number of users @xmath0 , while the macrocell attracts a larger number of users @xmath1 .",
    "the users are uniformly distributed over the entire system coverage area , all having the same chip rate , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the system bandwidth .",
    "the macrocell users have the same fixed data rate , @xmath4 , and the same output signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) requirement , @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 microcell users , on the other hand , can be high - speed and are given access to the microcell one - at - a - time . the microcell resembles a _ data access point _ ( dap ) , i.e. , a base station with limited coverage area that provides high data rates to a small number of users in sequence .",
    "some examples of dap - like applications are in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the uplink data rate , @xmath7 , of any given microcell user has a maximum achieveable value , @xmath8 , determined by existing interference conditions",
    ". we will quantify @xmath8 and related quantities for a given a microcell output sinr requirement .",
    "we focus here on the uplink , which we have shown in @xcite to be the limiting direction in this kind of architecture .",
    "+   + in section [ sysarch ] , we elaborate on the system architecture , the uplink sinr s , and the path gain model used . in the process , we identify a normalized desensitivity factor , @xmath9 , that is a key design variable . in section [ datarates ]",
    ", we derive the uplink transmission rate for a given user and propose ( and confirm via simulation ) a simple approximation for its probability distribution . in section [ throughputs ] ,",
    "we compute , as functions of @xmath9 , the average per - user and per - dap throughputs and show that the choice of @xmath9 involves a tradeoff between user high - speed capability and overall dap utilization .",
    "we also show the tradeoff between dap performance and total user population .",
    "we assume a system in which @xmath10 data users in some region @xmath11 communicate with either a low - speed macrocell base or a microcell base acting as a dap , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sysfig ] . in our computations",
    ", we will further assume that the region @xmath11 is a square of side @xmath12 , with the macrocell base at its center , the microcell base at some distance @xmath13 from the center , and users located with uniform randomness over the region .",
    "+   + each data user communicates with the macrocell at a fixed rate @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the spreading factor of the cdma code .",
    "however , when a user s path gain to the microcell base ( dap ) exceeds some threshold , it becomes a candidate for communication , at higher speed , with the dap .",
    "the base selection criterion we use is that the macrocell base is selected whenever the user s path gain to it exceeds that to the dap by some fraction @xmath16 , called the _ desensitivity factor _ , or just _ desensitivity_. clearly , the smaller @xmath16 is , the smaller the number of users eligible for dap access .",
    "+   + we denote by @xmath6 the number of eligible dap users at any time , and specify that they access the dap sequentially .",
    "each gets a timeslot whose duty cycle is @xmath17 , and a data rate during the timeslot that depends on factors discussed below .",
    "the remaining @xmath18 users simultaneously access the macrocell base at data rate @xmath4 .",
    "these users require a minimum sinr of @xmath5 while each of the @xmath6 dap users requires a minimum sinr of @xmath19 .",
    "each of the @xmath6 microcells users accesses the microcell one - at - a - time so that , at any one time , there are exactly @xmath20 system users .",
    "the base stations employ matched filter ( rake ) receivers to detect these active users .",
    "each base controls the transmit powers of its own users so that each user meets the minimum output sinr requirement at that base .",
    "for such a system , the output sinr s at the macrocell and microcell are @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the received power from each macrocell user at the macrocell base and the received power from the microcell user at the microcell base , respectively ; @xmath25 is the received noise power , at each base , in bandwidth @xmath3 ; @xmath4 and @xmath7 are the bit rates of macrocell and microcell users , respectively ; and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the normalized cross - tier interferences .",
    "specifically , @xmath27 is the normalized interference from the @xmath28 macrocell users into the microcell base , and @xmath26 is the normalized interference from the one active microcell user into the macrocell base .",
    "as shown in @xcite , @xmath27 and @xmath26 depend solely on the set of path gains from the active users to both bases , and on @xmath16 .",
    "they are @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the path gain from the microcell user to the macrocell ( microcell ) base ; @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the path gain from the @xmath35-th macrocell user to the microcell ( macrocell ) base ; and @xmath36 denotes the set of all macrocell users .",
    "the denominators in ( [ i m ] ) and in each term of ( [ imu ] ) are a consequence of using power control to each user from its serving base .",
    "adequate performance requires that @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the path gain , @xmath39 , between either base and a user at a distance @xmath40 is assumed to be @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the `` breakpoint distance '' ( in the same units as @xmath40 ) , at which the slope of the db path gain versus distance changes ; @xmath43 is a zero - mean gaussian random variable for each user position , with standard deviation @xmath44 ; and @xmath45 is a proportionality constant that depends on wavelength , antenna heights and antenna gains .",
    "note that @xmath39 is a local spatial average , so that multipath effects are averaged out .",
    "there can be different values of @xmath42 for the microcell and macrocell , and similarly for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the factor @xmath46 is often referred to as lognormal shadow fading , which varies slowly over the terrain . both @xmath43 and @xmath40 are random variables for a randomly selected user .",
    "+   + due to the greater height and gain of the typical macrocell antenna , we can assume @xmath47 .",
    "as mentioned above , the system we examine here assumes path - gain - based selection , i.e. , a user selects the macrocell base if the path gain to it exceeds the path gain to the microcell base by some specified fraction @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , the path gain of a user to the macrocell exceeds its path gain to the microcell by a value @xmath48 for the same distance and shadow fading .",
    "therefore , base selection depends fundamentally on the ratio @xmath49 , as opposed to @xmath16 alone .",
    "( we chose not to normalize @xmath16 by @xmath50 in our study in @xcite . ) the factor @xmath49 is called the _",
    "normalized desensitivity _ of the microcell , and is hereafter denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath9 correspond to higher path gain requirements to the microcell .",
    "this means that outlying users are generally excluded from access to the microcell , and a smaller microcell coverage area results .",
    "for a given number of dap users @xmath6 , we have @xmath18 macrocell users , and there is a probability @xmath51 ( derivable from the results in @xcite ) that @xmath6 of the @xmath10 users will choose the microcell and @xmath52 the macrocell .",
    "we can show from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) that the requirements @xmath37 and @xmath38 yield positive solutions for @xmath24 and @xmath23 if and only if @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the _ single - cell pole capacity _ of the macrocell @xcite .",
    "thus , we can find @xmath55 , the maximum achieveable @xmath7 when @xmath6 users choose the microcell : using ( [ feas1 ] ) with @xmath56 , and noting that the spreading factor @xmath57 can not be less than 1 , we have @xmath58 we define @xmath59 and , henceforth , we examine this normalized data rate . note that @xmath60 will be different as each of the @xmath6 users takes its turn , because @xmath61 depends on the set of all ( active ) user path gains .",
    ", the product @xmath62 in ( 7 ) does , as well .",
    "the denominator @xmath63 in ( 3 ) , which decreases with increasing microcell coverage area ( i.e. , with increasing @xmath9 ) , has the dominant impact on @xmath62 and , thus , @xmath64 . ] also , for any given user , we see that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are random variables because of the random locations and shadow fadings of all users .",
    "thus , @xmath60 is itself a random variable . to facilitate analysis",
    ", we assume ( and will show ) that @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be treated as lognormal variates , whose first and second moments are obtainable using the results in @xcite . since @xmath65 is lognormal under this assumption ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath60 , as given above , is a truncated lognormal random variable .",
    "the appendix shows how the lognormal parameters are obtained from the moments of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "+   + let @xmath66 denote the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath60 for a given @xmath6 .",
    "the cdf of @xmath60 with the condition on @xmath6 removed , but subject to @xmath6 exceeding 0 , is ( which happens with probability @xmath67 ) , we have no interest in the data rate of a non - existent user !",
    "thus , we seek the cdf of @xmath60 when there is at least one dap user . ]",
    "@xmath68 assuming that @xmath66 can be approximated as the cdf of a truncated lognormal random variable , @xmath69 can approximated by a weighted sum of cdf s of truncated lognormals .",
    "+   + to test the reliability of the lognormal approximation , we performed a series of simulation trials .",
    "we assumed a square region @xmath11 with sides of length @xmath12 over which users are uniformly distributed , with the two bases separated by @xmath13 .",
    "for the system and propagation parameters listed in table 1 , we determined the achieveable data rates of microcell users over 10,000 trials , for various values of @xmath9 and with @xmath70 . corresponds , for the parameters of table 1 , to a highly stressed macrocell , i.e. , @xmath71 , the macrocell pole capacity .",
    "later we show the general tradeoff between @xmath10 and dap throughput . ]",
    "the resulting cdf of @xmath60 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ cdfs_singleuser ] . along with simulation results",
    ", this figure contains cdfs obtained from analysis , ( [ cdfrmu ] ) , assuming lognormal cross - tier interferences .",
    "these results show that the lognormal approximation is reliable over a wide range of @xmath9 . as @xmath9 gets smaller ,",
    "the data rates of the microcell users increase , suggesting that smaller @xmath9 is desirable . the problem with _",
    "extremely _ small @xmath9 , however , is that it shrinks the population of possible microcell users .",
    "the result is under - utilization of the dap , as discussed below .",
    "we define our throughput variable as the time - averaged data rate normalized by @xmath3 .",
    "the per - user throughput , @xmath72 , takes into account the time - limited access that data users must accept if there is more than one microcell user in the system .",
    "this division of time effectively reduces data rates @xmath73 in a system with @xmath6 microcell users by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "the cdf of @xmath72 is thus @xmath74 where @xmath75 is as defined earlier .",
    "the cdf of @xmath72 can be approximated using the truncated - lognormal assumption for @xmath8 , ( [ rmueq ] ) . using both simulation and this approximation",
    ", we again considered the single - macrocell / single - microcell system described above , with the parameters in table 1 .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ peruser_cdfs ] for three different values of @xmath9 .",
    "we see that the approximate distribution follows the simulation distribution very closely for all three values .",
    "the jumps in fig .",
    "3 are related to the fact that per - user data rates are confined to the discrete values @xmath76 , @xmath77 for the high fraction of cases where @xmath78 . +   +",
    "the _ total _",
    "throughput for the dap , for given a @xmath79 , is the sum of the throughputs for the @xmath6 users .",
    "we denote the total throughput ( i.e. , dap utilization ) by @xmath80 .",
    "thus , @xmath80 represents performance from the network operator s point - of - view , while @xmath72 represents performance from the user s point - of - view .",
    "we quantify the average per - user and per - dap throughputs , as functions of @xmath9 , where the averaging is over random locations and shadow fadings of the users .",
    "@xmath81 is obtained via the formula for its cdf , ( [ cdfsum2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath82 is obtained by noting that @xmath83 is just @xmath84 . removing the condition on @xmath6 , we get @xmath85 the results for @xmath81 and @xmath86",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ avg_thruputs ] for @xmath70 .",
    "they are given for both simulation and the approximation method , and we see very strong agreement . for this system , we see that , when @xmath87 , @xmath88 . this value of @xmath9 ( which we call @xmath89 ) is desirable , since it balances the throughput for both individual users and the overall dap . when @xmath90 , individual user throughputs are compromised for the sake of higher dap utilization ; when @xmath91 , higher per - user throughputs are obtained , but for an under - utilized dap .",
    "the results reported thus far assumed @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "it is instructive to repeat the above exercise for a range of @xmath10 , to show the tradeoff between total user population and dap throughput .",
    "thus , we have computed @xmath81 and @xmath86 as functions of @xmath9 for various @xmath10 , still assuming a uniform distribution of users . for each value of @xmath10",
    ", @xmath81 decreases and @xmath86 increases with increasing @xmath9 , just as in fig .",
    "4 ; however , the values of @xmath92 and @xmath89 change with @xmath10 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "+   + for a given @xmath9 , decreasing @xmath10 implies a shrinking number of dap users , leading to a less utilized dap .",
    "thus , @xmath9 must be increased to maintain high dap utility , i.e. , @xmath89 must increase as @xmath10 decreases below @xmath93 . at the same time",
    ", the cross - tier interference at the dap shrinks , leading to increases in @xmath92 . in the region @xmath94 , the average @xmath6 at @xmath95 is close to 1 , so that @xmath96 . in the region @xmath97",
    ", meeting the feasibility condition @xmath98 , ( 6 ) , requires that @xmath99 .",
    "the result is a sharp decline in @xmath92 as @xmath10 increases from @xmath93 , as foretold by the steepness of the @xmath92-curve at @xmath70 .      using the methods presented here",
    ", throughput results can be obtained for a system with a denser user distribution around the dap .",
    "we found that , as the density around the dap increases , both @xmath89 and @xmath92 decrease .",
    "smaller values of @xmath89 are desirable because they help reduce @xmath6 , the number of users that must share the dap . despite this , as the user density around the dap increases , the most probable value of @xmath6 increases , resulting in smaller @xmath72 and a net ( modest ) reduction in @xmath92 .",
    "we have demonstrated that by controlling the desensitivity factor , a microcell can be converted to a data access point .",
    "the data rate of the single dap user was analyzed and shown to be well - represented as a truncated - lognormal variate .",
    "a method was then developed to compute the throughput statistics , and we found values of desensitivity , over the practical range of user population , for which both per - user and total dap throughputs are reasonably high .",
    "the user data rate , @xmath100 is seen from ( [ rmueq ] ) to be the lesser of 1 and @xmath101 , where @xmath102 . defining @xmath103 , we have @xmath104 .",
    "clearly , if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are lognormal , @xmath105 is a gaussian random variable whose mean and standard deviation are obtainable from the means and standard deviations of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "+   + in @xcite , the first and second moments of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are derived for the two - cell system .",
    "the means and standard deviations of @xmath106 and @xmath107 are then obtainable as follows : let the mean and standard deviation of @xmath106 be @xmath108 and @xmath44 , respectively . from lognormal statistics @xcite , @xcite , @xmath109 solving for @xmath108 and @xmath44 , @xmath110 similar results apply to @xmath111 .",
    "thus , @xmath60 can be fully described as a truncated lognormal variate given the first two moments of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and assuming both are lognormal .",
