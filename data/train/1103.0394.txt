    "modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) was originally proposed by @xcite to explain the rotation curves of disk galaxies without invoking the presence of dark matter ( dm ) and , over the years , it has been successful at reproducing the observed kinematics of several galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . however , to some extent , the mond and dm interpretations of the kinematics of galaxies can be degenerate .",
    "for instance , a mond rotation curve can be also described in the newtonian gravity invoking a dm halo such that the total gravitational field is the same as the mond one .",
    "more generally , given a mond system , it is possible to construct the _ equivalent newtonian system _ ( ens ) , i.e. the newtonian system with dm in which the visible matter has the same phase - space distribution as in the mond system @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the physical viability of the ens is not guaranteed , as for some configurations the density of the associate dm halo turns out to be negative @xcite . though a mond system and its ens are , by construction , indistinguishable from a _",
    "point of view ( for instance , as far as the rotation curve or the velocity - dispersion profile are concerned ) , in general they are not identical from a _ dynamical _ point of view : for instance , two - body relaxation , dynamical friction and galaxy merging act differently in the two cases @xcite .",
    "as already recognized , mond and enss might differ substantially also in terms of stability .",
    "as one of the original motivations for invoking dm halos in disk galaxies was that purely baryonic newtonian disks are prone to bar - like instability @xcite , it is not surprising that the study of dynamical stability in mond has focused mainly on disks @xcite .",
    "here we consider instead the so - called radial - orbit instability , which is relevant to pressure - supported stellar systems . as well known , in the context of newtonian gravity the amount of radial orbits in stellar systems is limited not only by the requirement of phase - space consistency ( i.e. positivity of the distribution function ; see , e.g. , * ?",

    "* ) but also by the fact that very radially anisotropic spherical systems are unstable @xcite . in newtonian gravity",
    "dm halos tend to have a stabilizing effect against radial - orbit instability @xcite , which suggests that mond systems might be more prone to this kind of instability than their enss .",
    "if confirmed , this could provide a discriminant between the two theories when interpreting the velocity dispersion profiles in pressure - supported stellar systems .",
    "for these reasons , in this work we use @xmath0-body simulations to explore the stability of radially anisotropic mond spherical systems and , for comparison , of their enss and of purely baryonic newtonian systems with the same density distributions and anisotropy profiles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secmod ]",
    "the galaxy models used in the simulations are described .",
    "their phase - space consistency is discussed in section  [ seccon ] and their stability in section  [ secsta ] . section  [ secfin ] concludes .",
    "we consider mond as modified gravity in the non - relativistic formulation of @xcite , in which the poisson equation @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath2 = 4\\pi g \\rho , \\label{eqmond}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the standard euclidean norm , @xmath4 is the mond gravitational potential , @xmath5 is a characteristic acceleration , and @xmath6 is the so - called interpolating function ( in the present work we adopt @xmath7 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the mond gravitational acceleration is @xmath8 , just as the newtonian acceleration is @xmath9 . for a system of finite mass , @xmath10 as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the position vector .",
    "as well known , from the poisson equation and equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) it follows that the mond and newtonian gravitational accelerations are related by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a solenoidal field dependent on the specific @xmath16 considered . since in general @xmath17 , and its expression is unknown _ a priori _ , standard poisson solvers can not be used to develop mond @xmath0-body codes , in which equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) must be solved at each time step ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in the present work we use our original mond @xmath0-body code  (",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see section  [ secsim ] ) .",
    "the initial conditions of the simulations are @xmath0-body realizations of galaxy models with the stellar component described by a spherical @xmath18-model @xcite with density distribution @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total stellar mass , @xmath21 is the scale radius , and @xmath18 is the negative of the inner logarithmic density slope ( @xmath22 ) . for simplicity",
    "we restrict to the cases @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite ; we recall that for @xmath25 the newtonian potential is @xmath26}.\\ ] ] for these models the mond potential , required to distribute the particles in the velocity space , is easily calculated from the newtonian one , as in spherical symmetry @xmath27 .",
    "the ens associated with a model of stellar density @xmath28 and mond potential @xmath4 has a _ total _",
    "density @xmath29 .",
    "however , the resulting dm halo density ( obtained after subtraction of @xmath28 ) in principle may be negative or have a non - monotonic radial trend .",
    "fortunately , it can be proved that the dm halos of the ens derived from the spherical @xmath23 and @xmath24 models are everywhere positive .",
    "instead , possible non - monotonicity of the dm density distribution makes the consistency of the halo a non - trivial request , as we will discuss in section  2.1 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in order to impose a tunable amount of radial anisotropy on the initial conditions , we adopt the widely used osipkov - merritt ( om ) parametrization @xcite , in which the stellar distribution function depends on energy and angular momentum per unit mass through the variable @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the relative energy , @xmath32 is the velocity modulus , @xmath33 is the relative potential , @xmath34 is the angular momentum modulus per unit mass , and @xmath35 is the so - called anisotropy radius .",
    "the anisotropy parameter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath36 : for @xmath37 the velocity dispersion tensor is radially anisotropic , while for @xmath38 the tensor is nearly isotropic . in the limit @xmath39 , @xmath40 and",
    "the velocity dispersion tensor becomes globally isotropic .    in the purely baryonic newtonian models , the distribution function can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the newtonian relative potential and @xmath43 is the so - called augmented density ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the mond ( and in the ens ) cases a similar formula holds , i.e. @xmath44 where now @xmath45 is the mond relative potential that , by construction , is also the total potential of the ens . note that",
    ", at variance with equation ( 4 ) , the lower integration limit is now @xmath46 : due to the far - field logarithmic behaviour of the mond potential in isolated systems of finite mass , the distribution function must be positive for all values of @xmath47 in analogy with finite - mass newtonian system in a total isothermal potential , where stars of all energies are bound ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "apart from a few exceptions ( see section  [ seclive ] ) , in the simulations of the enss the halo is maintained `` frozen '' ( i.e. it acts as a fixed external potential ) , so its distribution function is not needed .      as well known , in ( single- or multi - component )",
    "om models it is possible to determine a critical value of the anisotropy radius of each density component , @xmath48 , so that for @xmath49 the models are inconsistent , i.e. , @xmath50 for some admissible value of @xmath51 .",
    "a necessary condition for consistency of om models is @xmath52 at all radii @xcite .",
    "as recently proved in ciotti & morganti ( 2010a , b ; see also van hese , baes & dejonghe 2011 ; an 2011 ) this condition is rigorously equivalent to the global density slope - anisotropy inequality ( gdsai ) , i.e. to the requirement that at each radius the negative of the logarithmic slope of the stellar density distribution can not be less than twice the local value of the anisotropy parameter , @xmath53 . remarkably , it is easy to show that the gdsai _ is independent of the gravity law holding the system together _ , so that it holds not only for newtonian multi - component systems ( such as the ens ) , but also in the mond case .",
    "we applied the gdsai to our families of models , determining for each stellar density profile the value of @xmath48 ( see table 1 ) , and the obtained limits coincide with those determined in @xcite . as these are just necessary conditions for consistency , the positivity of the distribution function",
    "must still be checked numerically for @xmath54 .",
    "we also note that from the inequality @xmath55 it follows that in case of isotropy ( @xmath56 ) a spherical density distribution must be necessarily monotonically decreasing for increasing @xmath57 , and this imposes quite strong constraints on the dm halos of physically admissible ens .",
    "if the halo has a central `` hole '' ( which is not unusual for enss ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it can be physically realized only if its orbital distribution is tangentially biased , at least in the internal regions . in practice , this is not an issue in simulations with frozen dm halos , but it is an important problem when setting up initial conditions for simulations in which the dm halo is `` live '' ( i.e. modelled with particles ; see section  [ seclive ] ) .",
    "we now describe the main results of the @xmath0-body simulations . before",
    ", we briefly illustrate the numerical code  and the tests performed .",
    "we ran @xmath0-body simulations with , our original parallel three - dimensional particle - mesh code that can be used to follow the evolution of either mond or newtonian collisionless stellar systems @xcite . in previous papers",
    "we have already used  to demonstrate significant differences in violent relaxation , merging and dynamical friction in mond and newtonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "we refer the readers to these papers and to @xcite for a more detailed description of the code . in the present study",
    "the spherical grid has 64 radial nodes , 32 nodes in colatitude @xmath58 and 64 nodes in azimuth @xmath59 , and the total number of particles is @xmath60 .",
    "we verified with convergence experiments that these numbers of particles and grid points exclude important discreteness effects .",
    "in particular we reran some of the simulations with a grid @xmath61 and @xmath62 , finding that the results are almost identical to the corresponding lower - resolution cases .    in each simulation",
    "the initial conditions consist of an @xmath0-body realization of the stellar distribution of an isolated equilibrium galaxy model , in which the particles are distributed in phase space with the standard rejection technique , using the numerically recovered distribution functions . in the ens simulations ,",
    "even if the dm halo is frozen , the systems are truncated exponentially at a radius @xmath63 , so that the potential well is finite . as a rule ,",
    "we adopt @xmath64 , but we ran some of the simulations also with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , finding that the stability properties of a model do not depend on the specific choice of the truncation radius .",
    "following @xcite , we identify each mond initial condition by fixing a value of the dimensionless internal acceleration parameter @xmath67 , so @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not independent quantities . in physical units , introducing the quantity @xmath68 , @xmath69 , the time and velocity units are @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the simulations are evolved up to @xmath72 with a time step @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the characteristic dynamical time of the system . in the purely baryonic newtonian @xmath18-models ,",
    "we adopt the standard half - mass radius value @xmath75^{3/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the mean stellar density inside the half  mass radius @xmath77 ( we recall that @xmath78 for @xmath23 and @xmath79 for @xmath24 ) . in the corresponding mond models ( and their enss ) , @xmath74 is given by the above expression multiplied by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the circular velocity at @xmath77 for the purely baryonic newtonian system and @xmath82 is the same quantity for the mond system .    following @xcite , in order to determine whether a given model is unstable , we check its departures from spherical symmetry by monitoring the evolution of its intrinsic axis ratios @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the longest , intermediate and shortest axes of the inertia ellipsoid of the stellar distribution ) . as preliminary tests we ran simulations in which the initial conditions are isotropic purely baryonic newtonian , mond and enss .",
    "we found that numerical uncertainties ( due to the finite number of particles ) on @xmath83 and @xmath84 never exceed @xmath88 over @xmath72 of evolution of these stable isotropic models .",
    "as a consequence , we define _ unstable _ the models for which the axis ratio @xmath89 after 100 @xmath74 is smaller than a fiducial threshold value @xmath90 . in the simulations",
    "the onset of the instability is just due to numerical noise produced by discreteness effects in the initial conditions .",
    "as expected , we found that an exact determination of the stability threshold for a given family of models is not straightforward : while for strongly anisotropic initial conditions the onset of the instability is apparent and the numerical models settle down into a final equilibrium configuration in a few dynamical times , for nearly stable initial conditions the instability can be characterized by very slow growth rates and its effects become evident even after tens of @xmath74 .      for a given initial stellar density profile ( i.e. @xmath23 or @xmath24 in equation  [ eqrhostar ] ) , we explored , besides the purely baryonic newtonian case ( models n@xmath91 and n@xmath92 in table  1 ) , two families of mond systems ( and the corresponding families of enss ) , characterized by the values of the acceleration ratio @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( see table  1 for a summary ) .",
    "the cases with @xmath93 correspond to low - acceleration systems with internal accelerations everywhere much lower than @xmath95 , in the so - called deep - mond regime .",
    "their associated enss are therefore totally dm dominated systems ( table  1 , column 3 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath94 cases are systems with relatively high accelerations within @xmath77 , corresponding in the newtonian context to systems dominated by baryons in the central regions and by dm only at @xmath96 ( table  1 , column 3 ) .",
    "the four panels of fig .",
    "[ figden ] show the baryonic and dm initial density profiles of the enss corresponding to the @xmath93 and @xmath94 mond systems , for the two explored values of @xmath18 . as can be seen",
    ", the associated dm halos do not show a central hole and so , at least from this point of view , are not unrealistic ( see section  [ seccon ] ) .      for each family of models",
    "we have a set of eight simulations , in which the initial conditions differ only in the value of the normalized anisotropy radius @xmath97 .",
    "this is apparent in fig .",
    "[ figcara ] , where we plot the final axis ratio @xmath89 vs. the initial value of @xmath97 for all the explored models of the ten families .",
    "the stability properties of the models can be inferred directly from fig .",
    "[ figcara ] : it is clear that the value of @xmath35 at which instability appears is largest for mond models , smallest for the corresponding enss , and intermediate for purely baryonic newtonian systems . because of the very nature of the radial - orbit instability ( very slow growth rates for marginally unstable systems ) , a precise determination of the value of the minimum anisotropy radius for stability @xmath98 is difficult . what can be estimated robustly with @xmath0-body simulations",
    "is a fiducial value of @xmath98 separating apparently unstable systems from _ bona fide _ stable systems . adopting as fiducial threshold for stability @xmath99 ( horizontal dashed line in each panel of fig .  [ figcara ] )",
    ", we estimate for each family of models the minimum anisotropy radius for stability @xmath98 , which is reported ( in units of @xmath77 ) in table  1 .",
    "as expected , the differences in the stability limit between mond and enss are more evident in systems with lower values of the acceleration ratio @xmath100 ( or , from a newtonian point of view , for more dm dominated systems ) .",
    "for instance , if we consider @xmath23 models with @xmath93 , which are representative of low - surface density systems with flat inner stellar density profile ( such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies ) , we find @xmath101 for mond and @xmath102 for the ens ; very similar results are obtained for the more peaked hernquist @xmath24 models . unsurprisingly ,",
    "newtonian models with the dm halo are less subject to the radial - orbit instability than the purely baryonic newtonian models .    thus , from this first analysis we conclude that , when using @xmath97 as an indicator of the amount of admissible radial orbits , mond systems are more prone to radial - orbit instability than their associated enss , and also than corresponding purely baryonic newtonian models . however , as we will see in the next section , the comparison between the mond and the associated purely baryonic newtonian families is subtle : the fact that the latter typically admit smaller @xmath97 values does not imply that ( globally ) they can sustain more radial kinetic energy .",
    "stability limitations expressed in terms of @xmath35 are particularly relevant to observational works , as @xmath35 enters directly in the jeans equations that are routinely used to fit the velocity - dispersion profiles of stellar systems . however , from a deeper point of view , the value of @xmath35 ( loosely speaking , the radius outside which orbits are mainly radial ) is not a robust measure of the fraction of kinetic energy that is stored in radial orbits , which , at least in the newtonian context , is believed to be the main indicator of the tendency to develop radial - orbit instability .",
    "more specifically , it has been argued @xcite that a proper criterion for stability for newtonian self - gravitating systems can be expressed in terms of the global anisotropy parameter @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the radial and tangential components of the kinetic energy tensor , respectively .",
    "global isotropy corresponds to a value of the fridman - polyachenko - shukhman parameter @xmath107 .",
    "indications exist that there is a critical value @xmath108 such that only systems with @xmath109 are stable , and it is widely accepted that @xmath110 , relatively independent of the specific density distribution .",
    "a priori we do not have reasons to expect that @xmath103 can be used as a stability indicator also in mond . in any case , by definition @xmath108 measures how much radial anisotropy can be supported by a stable system , so it is interesting to discuss the stability properties of our mond , purely baryonic newtonian and enss in terms of @xmath103 .",
    "the values of @xmath108 for the families of models studied in the present work are reported in table  1 , and in fig .",
    "[ figxi ] we show all the models in the @xmath89-@xmath103 plane to be compared with the analogous fig .  [ figcara ] .    for the purely baryonic newtonian models the interpretation of these numbers is straightforward :",
    "we find @xmath111 , in agreement with the standard criterion and with previous numerical studies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the mond models we find @xmath112 , with @xmath108 depending on both the stellar density profile and the acceleration ratio @xmath100 .",
    "these values are substantially higher than those found for the corresponding purely baryonic newtonian models , indicating that , for given density distribution , mond systems can sustain more radial kinetic energy than newtonian systems without dm .",
    "this is not in contrast with the findings reported in the previous section , i.e. that mond models have larger @xmath98 than purely baryonic newtonian models .",
    "in fact , for fixed density profile and @xmath35 value , a mond model has higher @xmath103 than a purely baryonic newtonian model , because more kinetic energy is stored in the outer parts , where orbits are radially biased and the gravitational field of mond systems is stronger , have the same value of @xmath103 . ] .",
    "apparently , this effect compensates the larger values of admissible @xmath35 . instead , the enss are again found able to sustain systematically higher values of @xmath108 than the corresponding families mond systems , and this clearly indicates that mond systems are more subject to radial - orbit instability than newtonian models with dm and identical total gravitational field .    in general ,",
    "for both mond and enss we find a substantial spread in the values of @xmath108 , supporting the expectation that a `` universal '' value of @xmath108 does not exist for these systems ( for newtonian models with dm , extended versions of the stability criterion have been proposed ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the data in table  1 suggest that in mond , and even more in the enss , @xmath108 increases ( i.e. , relatively more kinetic energy can be stored in radial orbits ) for decreasing @xmath100 .",
    "while for the enss this trend can be explained because in the limit @xmath113 the stars become just tracers , it is tempting to speculate that in mond this behaviour can be interpreted as a manifestation of the less mixing nature of mond with respect to newtonian gravity .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the well established numerical finding that phase mixing @xcite and violent relaxation @xcite in mond systems take longer ( in units of dynamical times ) than in the newtonian case .",
    "very qualitatively , the deep - mond force between particles behaves like @xmath114 , i.e. it is nearer to the harmonic oscillator force than the @xmath115 force , and it is easy to show that a system in which particles interact with the harmonic oscillator force , no mixing or instabilities are possible , as each particle moves independently of the others @xcite . curiously , even though mond forces in a system of particles are non - additive , a similar trend towards longer relaxation times has been also found recently in shell models interacting with additive @xmath116 forces @xcite , and the phase - space evolution of the case with @xmath114 forces is strikingly similar to the deep - mond collapses presented in @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath103 in mond is strongly affected by the properties of the system at large radii suggests to consider as a possible stability indicator the quantity @xmath117 , defined as the ratio of radial to tangential kinetic energy within @xmath77 : the maximum values for stability @xmath118 for our families of models are reported in the last column of table  1 .",
    "remarkably , all our mond and purely baryonic newtonian families have @xmath119 , while the enss have @xmath120 ( for @xmath94 ) and @xmath121 ( for @xmath93 ) , which leads us to speculate that _ a limit on the amount of the radial orbits within the half - mass radius might be used as an empirical stability criterion for mond stellar systems , valid from the newtonian to the deep - mond regime , i.e. independent of the value of the internal acceleration relative to @xmath95_. this result is reminiscent of that of @xcite , who found that an almost isotropic core can stabilize newtonian self - gravitating systems with very strong global radial anisotropy .",
    "the results on the stability of the enss might be affected to some extent by our assumption of frozen dm halo , because it is possible that an ens with live dm halo has different stability properties ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in order to assess to what extent our results are affected by the assumption of frozen dm halos , we reran the ens simulations of the family e@xmath122 with live dm halos .",
    "for technical reasons we ran these live - halo simulations with our  treecode ( fortran version of a fast poisson solver ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which was already tested against  in @xcite .",
    "as an additional test , we reran with  all the purely baryonic newtonian simulations of the family n@xmath91 , finding excellent agreement with those run with . in the live - halo simulations of the models of the family e@xmath122 we used @xmath123 particles for the stellar component and @xmath124 particles for the halo , which has mass @xmath125 for the adopted truncation radius @xmath64 .",
    "we verified numerically that for these two - component e@xmath122 models the halo density distribution , which is monotonically decreasing ( see fig .",
    "[ figden ] ) and thus satisfies the necessary condition for consistency ( see section  [ seccon ] ) , can be generated by a positive isotropic distribution function , which we used to distribute the dm particles in phase space with the standard rejection technique .",
    "the final axis ratios of the live - halo simulations ( hexagons in fig .",
    "[ figlive ] ) are not significantly different from those of the corresponding frozen - halo simulations ( squares in fig .",
    "[ figlive ] ) .",
    "it follows that the stability properties of the e@xmath122 family of models do not depend on whether the halo is modelled with particles or it is a fixed potential : in particular the values of the minimum anisotropy radius @xmath98 ( and then of the maximum fridman - polyachenko - shukhman parameter @xmath108 ) for stability are the same in the two cases .",
    "these results suggest that our conclusion that mond models are substantially more subject to radial - orbit instability than enss should be robust , at least if the dm halos are almost isotropic .",
    "though the assumption of isotropy of the halos is not necessarily justified , given that the anisotropy of dm distributions is hard to constrain , it is clear that an isotropic halo can be always be invoked , in the context of newtonian gravity , to stabilize an otherwise unstable strongly radially - anisotropic stellar system , while this freedom is not allowed in the context of mond .",
    "to some extent , the mond and dm interpretations of the kinematics of galaxies can be considered degenerate , i.e. several observational features can be satisfactorily reproduced in both paradigms .",
    "this raises interesting questions about possible tests to discriminate between mond and newtonian gravity with dm .",
    "fortunately , it is now well established that some important dynamical processes _ are _ different , even in systems in which the total gravitational potentials are identical .",
    "examples are dynamical friction and two - body relaxation .    in the present work we explored whether radial - orbit instability acts differently in mond and in newtonian gravity ( with and without dm ) ; in addition to the theoretical interest , this study can be useful to constrain the interpretation of the observed kinematics of stellar systems in the two cases .",
    "in particular , we have focused on the stability of om radially - anisotropic spherical @xmath18-models ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "we compared the results obtained for mond models , enss and purely baryonic newtonian systems , all with the same stellar density distribution .",
    "overall , we found that mond systems are more prone to radial - orbit instability than their enss , independent of the specific indicator ( @xmath35 or @xmath103 ) used to quantify the anisotropy .",
    "compared to purely baryonic newtonian systems with the same density profile , however , mond systems have larger minimum anisotropy radius for stability @xmath98 , but nevertheless higher maximum global anisotropy parameter for stability @xmath108 , a consequence of the larger kinetic energy that can be stored in their outer regions . we speculate that @xmath108 is larger in mond systems than in newtonian systems with no dm for the same reasons that phase mixing and violent relaxation are less efficient , i.e. , because the force between particles in deep - mond decreases with distance less strongly ( qualitatively as @xmath114 ) than in newtonian gravity , so being nearer to the special case of harmonic oscillator inter - particle forces , when instabilities and energy exchanges are impossible    observationally , these findings may be relevant to applications of mond to pressure - supported systems such as globular clusters , dwarf spheroidal and elliptical galaxies . for instance , the velocity - dispersion profiles of globular clusters in the outer parts of the milky way can been used to test mond . in the case of the globular cluster ngc  2419 strong om radial anisotropy ( @xmath35 close to @xmath48 )",
    "might be required in order to bring the velocity dispersion profile predicted by mond close to the profile inferred from the observed radial velocities of the cluster stars @xcite .",
    "a combination of the stability constraints discussed in this paper with new observations of the radial velocity of stars can make the kinematics of ngc  2419 a crucial test for mond ( ibata et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "another family of objects that are very interesting from the perspective of mond is that of dwarf spheroidal galaxies , because their low surface - brightness , combined with their measured velocity dispersion , lead to conclude that they must be dm dominated if newtonian gravity holds .",
    "@xcite studied the observed line - of - sight velocity - dispersion profiles of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies , finding that in most cases the data can be reproduced in mond , at least with somewhat _ ad hoc _ anisotropy profiles .",
    "this result should be reconsidered on the basis of the consistency and stability constraints discussed in the present work .",
    "the kinematics of elliptical galaxies has also been considered as a possible test for mond ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as for globular clusters and dwarf spheroidals , when trying to reproduce the kinematics of ellipticals , the anisotropy of the velocity distribution of the stars is one of the variables in the problem and it is important to constrain it as much as possible , along the lines described in the present paper .",
    "for instance , consistency constraints ( but not the more stringent stability constraints ) on the anisotropy of stars are considered in the recent investigation by @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite used the observed kinematics of planetary nebulae or of the satellites around elliptical galaxies as a test for mond , allowing for quite general anisotropy profiles for the satellite system . in this case , however , while some limits on the amount of radial anisotropy might come from the requirement of consistency , stability arguments do not necessarily lead to strong constraints as long as the considered tracers are not dynamical dominant .",

    "<S> the stability of radially anisotropic spherical stellar systems in modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) is explored by means of numerical simulations performed with the @xmath0-body code . </S>",
    "<S> we find that osipkov - merritt mond models require for stability larger minimum anisotropy radius than equivalent newtonian systems ( enss ) with dark matter , and also than purely baryonic newtonian models with the same density profile . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value for stability of the fridman - polyachenko - shukhman parameter in mond models is lower than in enss , but higher than in newtonian models with no dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that mond systems are substantially more prone to radial - orbit instability than enss with dark matter , while they are able to support a larger amount of kinetic energy stored in radial orbits than purely baryonic newtonian systems . </S>",
    "<S> an explanation of these results is attempted , and their relevance to the mond interpretation of the observed kinematics of globular clusters , dwarf spheroidal and elliptical galaxies is briefly discussed .    </S>",
