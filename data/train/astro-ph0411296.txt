    "post - agb stars are evolved stars with low to intermediate mass ( 0.8 - 8.0  m@xmath1 ) progenitors , that have left the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) but not yet become the central stars of planetary nebulae ( pn ) ( see review by van winckel 2003 ) .",
    "the heavy mass - loss that occurred on the agb has ended and the dust envelope that surrounds the star , as a result of this mass - loss , expands away from the star , decreasing in temperature while the temperature of the central star increases . during this",
    "relatively short ( 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 years ) phase , these cool dust rich envelopes radiate most of their energy at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "observations in the mid - infrared probe the inner , warmest part of the envelope , the area of most recent mass - loss which occurred near the end of the agb . studies of individual objects in this transitional post - agb phase can be used to investigate this final period of agb mass - loss and to determine the physical and chemical properties of the dust .",
    "iras 19500 - 1709 is associated with the high galactic latitude f2 - 3i ( parthasarathy , pottasch & wamsteker 1988 ) post - agb star hd  187885 ( sao 163075 ) and has the double - peaked spectral energy distribution ( sed ) typical of post - agb stars with detached circumstellar dust envelopes ( hrivnak , kwok & volk 1989 ) .",
    "the radiation from the star , reddened by the dust shell , peaks at around 1  @xmath0 m whereas the thermal emission , from the shell itself , peaks at 25 - 30  @xmath0 m .",
    "the post-3rd - dredge - up status of this object is confirmed by its high abundance of s - process elements ( van winckel & reyniers 2000 ) .",
    "the expansion velocity of the envelope , based on the co - line emission , is 11  km  s@xmath4 with wings up to 30  km  s@xmath4 ( likkel et al .",
    "the envelope is carbon rich , showing no oh or h@xmath5o maser emission ( likkel 1989 ) .",
    "it has a weak 21  @xmath0 m feature ( justtanont et al .",
    "1996 ) and a broad feature around 30  @xmath0 m ( hony , waters & tielens 2002 ) .",
    "the origin of these two features is unknown .",
    "von helden et al . ( 2000 ) identified titanium carbide ( tic ) as the carrier of the 21@xmath0 m feature but this has recently been disputed by li ( 2003 ) .",
    "speck & hofmeister ( 2004 ) have suggested that sic may carry the 21  @xmath0 m feature .",
    "goebel & moseley ( 1985 ) proposed that the 30  @xmath0 m feature may be due to magnesium sulphide ( mgs ) .",
    "the central star has a temperature of 8000  k ( van winckel & reyniers 2000 ) .",
    "imaging polarimetry has shown that iras 19500 - 1709 has a bipolar structure in scattered light ( gledhill et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in section 2 of this paper we present 10 and 20  @xmath0 m images of iras 19500 - 1709 taken with the mid - infrared camera , oscir , on gemini north . in section 3",
    "we discuss the results of our modelling of these images and of the sed using a dust radiation transport ( rt ) code .",
    "we present 10 and 20  @xmath0 m ( n and q3 band ) images of iras 19500 - 1709 taken on 2001 july 12 with oscir , mounted on the 8.1-m gemini north telescope ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "oscir is a mid - infrared camera and spectrometer system built by the university of florida infrared astrophysics group .",
    "the array field of view is 11 x 11 arcsec and the pixel scale 0.089 arcsec .",
    "we used the standard nodding / chopping mid - infrared observational technique to correct for the thermal background with a chop frequency of 3 hz and a chop throw of 15 arcsec . for each filter ,",
    "frame times were 10  ms and on - source exposure times were 4.3 min . for flux calibration we used vega , which we observed before and after observing iras 19500 - 1709 .",
    "atmospheric transmission , as determined by the vega measurements , varied throughout the night and average calibration factors have been calculated .",
    "the resultant n and q3 band fluxes , obtained by summing over the whole object , are given in table  1 .",
    "we have also used the vega observations as an indication of the point spread function ( psf ) and the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) is shown in table 1 along with other observing details .",
    "flat - field images were obtained for each filter by exposing on sky and on a polystyrene flat - field source without chopping and nodding and the flat - field constructed using the oflat task , which is part of the gemini package within iraf .",
    "the observations were reduced using the oreduce task in the gemini iraf package which derives the average of the chop and nod differences and produces a single flat - field - corrected image for each filter . a few lines of bad pixels on these images , caused by an oscir channel problem which was present during the early gemini observing runs , were fixed using an idl procedure provided by scott fisher ( oscir support team ) .    the images of iras 19500 - 1709 show that it is extended relative to the psf , with a fwhm of 1.2 arcsec in both filters and diameter of 4 arcsec .",
    "the n band image appears elongated in the outer contours with position angle ( pa ) of @xmath6 deg .",
    "we note that the telescope psf , as determined by observations of vega , is also elongated in a similar direction ( shown contoured in fig .  1 ) .",
    "however , the outer contours of the q3 band image appear round , although the psf is also elongated , suggesting that the elongation seen in the outer regions of the n band image may be real .",
    "this interpretation is strengthened by previous lower spatial resolution imaging which also tentatively suggests an elliptical structure with pa @xmath7 deg .",
    "( meixner et al .",
    "the brightness peak in the n band image appears approximately 0.2 arcsec off centre to the east , relative to the outer contours .",
    "the inner boundary , of any detached shell , is unresolved .",
    ".measurements for iras 19500 - 1709 for each filter showing the central wavelength ( @xmath8 ) , bandpass ( @xmath9 ) , flux and the fwhm of the psf , estimated from observations of vega .",
    "due to variations in sky transparency , the errors on the fluxes may be as large as @xmath10 per cent . [",

    "we present mid - infrared images and a model of the sed of iras 19500 - 1709 using amc , sic and mgs grains .",
    "we find that small dust grains ( @xmath11  @xmath0 m ) and a steep power law size distribution ( @xmath12=5 ) provide the best fit to the data .",
    "the observations constrain the inner radius of any detached dust shell to be a maximum size of 0.4 arcsec .",
    "our results suggest that this object must be at a distance of at least 4 kpc to be sufficiently luminous to be a post - agb star .",
    "we show that , at this distance , iras 19500 - 1709 would have an envelope mass of 0.42  m@xmath1 , that during the high mass - loss phase the mass - loss rate was @xmath13  m@xmath1  yr@xmath4 and that this phase ended @xmath14  yrs ago .",
    "although the inner envelope structure has not been resolved in these oscir observations , there is evidence for axisymmetry along an axis perpendicular to that seen in near - ir imaging observations .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "all model calculations were run on the hiperspace computing facility at university college , london .",
