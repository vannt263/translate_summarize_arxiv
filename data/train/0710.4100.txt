    "turbulence is characterized by large fluctuations of velocity gradients which appear preferentially at the smallest scales of the flow .",
    "the amplitudes of these events exceed the mean values by orders of magnitude which is known as small - scale intermittency @xcite .",
    "it is also believed that these intensive fine - scale fluctuations are intimately connected with the nonlinear cascade - like transfer of kinetic energy through the hierarchy of eddy structures that fill the fluid on larger scales @xcite",
    ". a better understanding of fluid turbulence as a whole requires thus a detailed resolution of the intermittent dynamics at the small - scale end of the inertial range . in other words",
    ", it is necessary to determine how deep into the beginning dissipation range the roughest filaments from the inertial range can sweep and how they affect the spectral decay of turbulent fluctuations with increasing reynolds number .",
    "this can also be important for the mixing in reacting and non - reacting flows at high schmidt number @xcite where a significant fraction of stirring of the concentration field takes place in the dissipation range of the flow .",
    "such a study requires that the steepest gradients and their statistics are well resolved .",
    "although significant progress in measurement techniques has been made @xcite , the finest structures remain still spatially unresolved in experiments .    in this letter , we present numerical simulations of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence that unravel the dynamics in exactly the region where inertial and dissipation ranges match , both in physical and fourier space . in order to study the fine - scale structure and their statistics ,",
    "a grid resolution is applied which exceeds that of standard simulations by an order of magnitude . in particular , the following questions will be answered .",
    "what are the finest spatial scales across which large - amplitude gradient events evolve ?",
    "how are these scales distributed as a function of the reynolds number ? is consequently the large - wavenumber behaviour of the energy spectra in the dissipation range reynolds number - dependent ?",
    "the large - wavenumber behaviour of the turbulent fluctuations at the smallest scales is a long - standing problem .",
    "kolmogorov postulated 65 years ago a universal form of the decay of the energy spectrum that goes deep down into the dissipation range @xcite . since then several analytical attempts have been made to determine the spectrum .",
    "the works left unspecified constants @xcite or considered an infinitely extended range of excited scales @xcite .",
    "numerically , the time advancement in the dissipation range is very challenging since a significant fraction of the computational ressources has to be spent for the resolution of the tiny amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the classical theory of turbulence predicts a mean scale at which the turbulent cascade ends and the flow viscosity starts to dominate .",
    "this scale is known as the kolmogorov length @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "it is derived by a dimensional estimate and does not capture for the observed intermittency of the velocity gradients .",
    "we see that the energy dissipation rate , that probes the velocity gradient magnitude , enters the definition of @xmath3 as a mean , @xmath4 . on the one hand , there are very intense gradients in the form of thin and stretched vortex tubes that seem to have diameters around @xmath3 , or even less . on the other hand , ambient regions will exist with typical spatial variations larger than @xmath3 .",
    "a whole range of local dissipation scales around the classical kolmogorov length follows from the picture .",
    "this idea was put forward first within the multifractal formalism @xcite . however , a direct analysis of the scales from data records remained very difficult , simply because these structures were not resolved .",
    "yakhot derived an estimate that connects a dissipation scale @xmath5 with a velocity increment @xmath6 across this scale from the equations of motion ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it reads @xmath7 technically , eq .  ( [ eta ] )",
    "is derived from a local kinetic energy balance by a so - called point - splitting procedure @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eta ] ) tells us that @xmath5 is a field fluctuating in space and time and suggests an implicit way to determine the local dissipation scales @xmath5 in numerical simulations , by velocity increments over kolmogorov and sub - kolmogorov distances .",
    "relation ( [ eta ] ) can be also obtained by equating convective time scale , @xmath8 , and dissipation time scale , @xmath9 , a step which is at the core of the multifractal approach of paladin and vulpiani @xcite .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of the local dissipation scales will be denoted as @xmath10 in the following . in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , we show an instantaneous snapshot of two isolevel sets of the field @xmath5 where the isosurfaces in red are nested in the transparent gray ones .",
    "the figure clearly underlines the fluctuating character of the field @xmath5 .",
    "once one accepts the concept of local dissipation scales , the question on the smallest local dissipation scale arises . this scale can be determined by matching the inertial and dissipation range dynamics in the equations for the longitudinal increment moments of order @xmath11 which are defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the turbulent velocity field projected onto @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the matching scale becomes order - dependent and is given by @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the integral scale and @xmath18 the corresponding large - scale reynolds number with @xmath19 .",
    "the exponents @xmath20 determine the scaling behaviour in the inertial range of turbulence , i.e. @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "in the limit of @xmath23 we expect @xmath24 and thus @xmath25 one obtains a steeper decrease with respect to the reynolds number as for the kolmogorov scale , @xmath26 . the same relation ( [ etamin ] ) follows in the multifractal approach by paladin and vulpiani @xcite for the roughest increments with hlder exponents @xmath27 .",
    "the three - dimensional navier - stokes equations for an incompressible flow are solved .",
    "the direct numerical simulations are based on the pseudospectral method with fast fourier transformations and a 2/3 de - aliasing .",
    "the simulation domain is a periodic cube with a volume of @xmath28 .",
    "the velocity field is kept in a statistically stationary state by a large scale volume forcing that is added to the r.h.s . of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "it injects kinetic energy into the flow at a fixed rate , @xmath29 , and thus prescribes the mean energy dissipation rate . in the case of statistical stationarity",
    "the kinetic energy balance reduces to @xmath30 .",
    "more details are found in @xcite .",
    "the turbulence is homogeneous and locally isotropic .",
    "some parameters of the present simulations are listed in table 1 .",

    "the value @xmath36 grows from approximately @xmath37 at @xmath38 to @xmath39 at @xmath0 .",
    "the scales for the smallest reynolds number go barely below @xmath40 .",
    "this indicates an increasing probability of very fine sub - kolmogorov scales to appear .",
    "it is in line with increasing small - scale intermittency of the velocity gradients which has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the small - scale end of the support in each of the pdfs is taken as the scale @xmath41 . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the theoretical model @xcite predicts @xmath42 ( see eq .",
    "( [ etamin ] ) ) .",
    "table 2 compares this estimate with our findings .",
    "we see that @xmath41 decreases more slowly than the theoretical prediction .",
    "the value of @xmath43 reached @xmath44 for the largest reynolds numbers . to conclude , ever finer sub - kolmogorov scales are excited for increasing @xmath45 , but not as pronounced as predicted by theory .",
    "the first moment of the distributions @xmath10 gives a mean dissipation scale which is always larger than @xmath3 .",
    "we find @xmath46 and 8.1 for @xmath47 and 107 , respectively .",
    "for the range of accessible reynolds numbers we thus observe an increase of the mean towards a scale @xmath48 which is the generally expected crossover scale from the inertial to the viscous subrange @xcite .",
    "the central question that was addressed in @xcite is if the increasing small - scale intermittency in physical space manifests as well for the spectra in the crossover to the dissipation range or even in the far - dissipation range .",
    "figure  [ fig.3 ] shows the instantaneous compensated energy spectra for the run at the largest reynolds number .",
    "it provides information about the variation of the spectra in the dissipation range and how this adds up to a mean spectrum that will be used for the following analysis .",
    "many numerical studies of the energy spectra have been focussed on the bottleneck phenomenon ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is thought to result from a depletion of the nonlinear fourier mode interaction at higher wavenumbers such that non - local mode couplings become more dominant .",
    "we did not observe a bottleneck for our spectra ( see inset of fig .  [ fig.3 ] ) .",
    "the reason can be the moderate reynolds numbers which are accessed here .",
    "it can however also be that the significantly larger range of resolved fourier modes in the viscous range diminishes this effect .",
    "since the moderate reynolds numbers prevent the quasi - algebraic scaling analysis from @xcite , we study the spectral decay with respect to measures that follow from the spectra themselves @xcite .",
    "the beginning of the dissipation range can be set at @xmath49 where @xmath50 has a maximum . in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] , the dissipation spectra for the three largest @xmath45 are rescaled by the corresponding @xmath51 .",
    "the dotted line indicates the data window from @xcite . while the energy spectra collapse quite well within the dotted box , differences arise for the largest resolved wavenumbers",
    "this indicates a deviation from the universality postulate made in the classical theory for the large - wavenumber decay of the energy spectra @xcite .",
    "we wish to stress that our reynolds number might still be too small for a firmer conclusion .     in the dissipation range for different reynolds numbers .",

    "the results from fig .  [ fig.4 ] suggest a closer analysis of the reynolds number dependence of the decay of the spectra in the far - dissipation range .",
    "the following form of the spectral decay for @xmath57 is used @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are reynolds - number - dependent dimensionless constants .",
    "the exponential term can be motivated from stokes eigenfunctions in the viscosity - dominated regime of the navier - stokes dynamics @xcite .",
    "the power law term @xmath61 was calculated by the direct interaction approximation ( dia ) to @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments at low reynolds numbers demonstrated later that @xmath59 can exceed 3 due to small - scale intermittency which is not contained in the theory @xcite . equation ( [ decay ] ) is transformed into the following local slope form @xmath63 which allows for direct determination of the two constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 by a least square fit .",
    "the upper picture of fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] shows the local slope of the large - wavenumber spectral decay .",
    "the two lower pictures in the same figure list the results for both coefficients , @xmath53 and @xmath56 . we have performed therefore _ local",
    "_ least square fits to ( [ fit ] ) in the interval @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "it should be stressed once more that the present data allow a systematic study of the dissipation range decay over an order of magnitude of taylor microscale reynolds numbers .",
    "the results are consistent with the findings from refs . @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath59 , which determines the nature of the singularity in the euler case , remains smaller zero for @xmath65 which results in a convex shape of the dissipation range spectrum .",
    "interestingly , this is the range of @xmath66 for which velocity gradients are clearly non - gaussian @xcite .",
    "the overall magnitude of the exponent @xmath60 decreases for growing reynolds number .",
    "a saturation of this decrease can be detected for the two largest reynolds number runs .",
    "this would be consistent with a saturation to a constant magnitude which was predicted by kraichnan @xcite . neither for @xmath59 nor for @xmath60 a systematic behaviour with respect to wavenumber @xmath54 is observed . the limited range of sub - kolmogorov scales that can be resolved is one reason .",
    "moreover , it should be stressed that the local fits of the exponential decay require a very high numerical accuracy as has been demonstrated in pauls _",
    "the double precision floating accuracy which we can provide only was not sufficient to apply more sophisticated local fit procedures to ( [ decay ] ) @xcite .",
    "finally , it was also checked that the rescaling with @xmath40 instead of @xmath3 does not alter the fit results significantly .",
    "the finest - scale intermittent fluctuations of fluid turbulence have been studied with a spectral resolution never applied before .",
    "they are associated with a whole range of local dissipation scales rather than a mean dissipation scale  the kolmogorov length @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the increase of small - scale intermittency with increasing reynolds number goes in line with an increasing spread - out of the local dissipation scales into the dissipation range .",
    "the growth of this scale range with respect to the reynolds number is small , but present .",
    "this is consisitent with a logarithmic dependence of the extension of the intermediate dissipation range on the reynolds number as proposed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we detected a growing amplitude of sub - kolmogorov - scale fluctuations which manifests in a slower exponential decay of the energy spectra in the large - wavenumber range .",
    "both numerical results confirm indications from other studies that increasing small - scale intermittency affects a growing number of scales in the dissipation range that are expected to be reynolds - number - independent ( and thus universal ) in the classical theory of turbulence .",
