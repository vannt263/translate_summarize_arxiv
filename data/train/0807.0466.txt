    "consider an asymptotically free , confining qcd - like gauge theory with a rank @xmath4 gauge group @xmath6 and @xmath7 flavors of massless fermions in a vector - like representation @xmath8 of @xmath6 ( or a mixture of representations ) , formulated on a space with one compact dimension .",
    "such theories possess a strong dynamical scale @xmath9 as a consequence of dimensional transmutation .",
    "there are three pieces of conventional wisdom associated with this class of theories . *",
    "a ) * even though the chiral symmetry and center symmetry are independent symmetries , their realization are parametrically entangled . *",
    "b ) * if phase transitions occur , they must take place in the numerical vicinity of strong scale @xmath9 .",
    "* c ) * if one takes the large @xmath4 limit ( in the conventional t hooft sense @xcite ) , the scale of the phase transitions must be @xmath10 .",
    "lattice gauge theory simulations unambiguously demonstrate that in finite temperature phase transitions , the above conventional wisdom is correct . any confining qcd - like theory , regardless of the representation @xmath8 of the fermions , will undergo a center symmetry ( or approximate center symmetry if center symmetry is absent ) changing confinement - deconfinement transition accompanied with the chiral symmetry transition which occurs around the strong scale @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the fact that a very high temperature phase with broken center symmetry can not support any kind of chiral condensate can be proven rigorously @xcite .",
    "the second assertion seems to be robust due to the absence of any other dimensionful parameters in the theory .",
    "the last one states that the large @xmath4 limit should be a good guide to probe such transitions .",
    "this is also an underlying assumption in recent holographic models of qcd .",
    "the thermal qcd - like theories provide full support for these three assertions .    in this letter",
    ", we wish to examine the validity of these common assertions by testing them in a slightly different setup .",
    "we wish to classify the phases of _ zero temperature _ qcd - like theories on a space with one compact spatial dimension , @xmath5 , as a function of @xmath2 radius .",
    "we will work in a euclidean setup , @xmath11 , hence the anti - periodic or periodic spin structure of the fermions , @xmath12 , along the @xmath2 circle , determines whether @xmath2 is thermal or spatial circle , respectively .",
    "the rationale behind this proposal lies in the sharp qualitative differences between thermal and quantum fluctuations . in this sense",
    ", using periodic boundary conditions for fermions is equally physical , and in some ways a better guide to single out the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the phase transitions on spatial @xmath13 ( if any ) , are induced by zero temperature quantum mechanical fluctuations rather then the thermal fluctuations .",
    "hence these are quantum phase transitions , as often appear in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "these quantum phase transitions reveal new and surprising phenomena in clear contradiction with the conventional wisdom .",
    "most notably , there are cases with chiral transitions in the absence of * any * change in center symmetry realizations .",
    "more interestingly , some such transitions takes place at a scale parametrically split from @xmath0 by factors of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , in qcd(adj ) with multiple fermions and periodic boundary conditions ( in which center symmetry never breaks @xcite ) , we will show that the chiral transition scale is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an order one numerical factor .",
    "the existence of the scale ( [ quantum ] ) is the main new result of this letter .",
    "this scale is invisible in the planar perturbation theory which combines the two coupling @xmath16 into a single t hooft coupling @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the reason is , the planar perturbative expansion does not respect the center symmetry of the small @xmath2 regime .",
    "the presence of such a suppressed scale may seem exotic .",
    "however , i will argue that it must exist in * all * confining qcd - like theories in the following sense : were the center symmetry to remain unbroken in a multi - flavor qcd - like theory ( either thermally or spatially compactified ) , a chiral transition would still take place and it would occur at @xmath18 ( and not at @xmath0 ) .",
    "hence , ( [ quantum ] ) is in fact the natural scale of the chiral transition in qcd , answering a question raised in @xcite .",
    "the vector - like gauge theories with massless fermions formulated on @xmath19 split into at least four categories according to their spatial center ( @xmath20 ) , and chiral ( @xmath21 ) symmetry realizations .",
    "the classes are :    the theories in which @xmath20 and @xmath21 symmetry realizations are entangled , either into a single transition or a non - parametrically separable double transition , and both transitions occur around strong scale @xmath22 .",
    "as asserted earlier , this richness is a reflection of the distinction of quantum versus thermal fluctuations .",
    "sufficiently high temperatures melt the hadrons and glueballs into quarks and gluons regardless of the fermionic matter content of the theory .",
    "the quantum fluctuations may or may not generate quantum melting .",
    "this depends on the matter content of the theory .",
    "therefore , probing a theory solely based on quantum fluctuations may be a better guide to study qcd dynamics .",
    "* phase transition as a function of @xmath4 : * the corollary implies that , although an @xmath29 gauge theory on small , fixed @xmath30 may be in a confinement without chiral symmetry breaking phase , on the same four - manifold , the @xmath31 theory is in a chirally asymmetric , confinement phase . in other words , the large @xmath32 limit is separated from the small @xmath4 theory on the same four - manifold by a phase transition . in such circumstances ,",
    "the large @xmath4 is not a good guide to study phases of the small @xmath4 theories , and such cases are generic .",
    "we assume the vector - like theories of our interest are in center symmetry unbroken , chiral symmetry broken phase at large @xmath30 .",
    "in the small @xmath2 regime , the center symmetry realization can be determined by conventional techniques , by evaluating the one loop potential in the background of the constant spatial wilson line @xmath33 , and by using periodic boundary conditions for fermions .",
    "below are the simplest examples for the four classes .    *",
    "i ) * consider qcd with @xmath7 complex representation fermions , such as fundamental , antisymmetric or symmetric . in these theories , the examination of the effective potential @xmath34 $ ] on sufficiently small",
    "@xmath2 shows that @xmath35 , and center symmetry is broken .",
    "the effect is due to @xmath36 part of the potential .",
    "the perturbative one loop potential also renders fermions massive with a gap of order @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the long distance correlators of chiral operators decays exponentially , with no formation of any condensate . although this class do not exhibit any novel scales , the center broken phase also breaks c , p , t as well as cpt .",
    "@xcite . in this sense",
    ", it is an interesting phase .",
    "the lattice studies of such qcd - like theories with one compact spatial dimension is initiated recently in refs .",
    "@xcite , and for @xmath29 gauge theory , a cpt breaking and restoring transition is observed .",
    "* ii ) * the examples of this class are @xmath38 sym theory with arbitrary gauge group @xmath6 . the one loop potential is @xmath39=0 $ ] due to supersymmetry .",
    "nonetheless , a nonperturbatively generated potential provides a repulsive interaction among eigenvalues of the spatial wilson line , and the spatial center symmetry @xmath20 is unbroken .",
    "the unbroken @xmath20 in the _ weakly _ coupled regime implies gauge symmetry  breaking \" down to the maximal abelian subgroup , @xmath40 at large distances .",
    "consequently , the fermion modes along the cartan subalgebra of @xmath6 remains massless , and they are part of the long distance physics",
    ". the fractional instanton ( monopole ) effects are sufficient to produce a chiral condensate and spontaneous breaking of discrete chiral symmetry .",
    "the ir dynamics in this case is drastically different from both case i ) and the thermal compactification .",
    "small @xmath2 exhibits abelian confinement and discrete chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "* iii ) * the asymptotically free qcd - like theories with @xmath41 adjoint majorana fermion are in this category . introducing adjoint fermions with periodic boundary conditions @xmath42 stabilizes the center symmetry breaking instability @xcite .",
    "the one loop potential for qcd(adj ) with @xmath42 is proportional to the negation of the one of pure ym theory : @xmath43 = ( 1-n_f ) v_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm ym}[u(x ) ]   \\label{eq : potadj}\\ ] ] this implies unbroken spatial center symmetry in qcd(adj ) with @xmath42 at small @xmath2 weak coupling regime , and consequent dynamical abelianization down to @xmath44 at large distances .",
    "qcd(adj ) has a continuous @xmath45 chiral symmetry . at small @xmath2",
    ", the theory exhibits confinement without chiral symmetry breaking as shown in @xcite for @xmath46 few . at long distances ,",
    "abelian confinement is operative just like the @xmath38 sym theory in the same regime , and the photons acquire mass via magnetic bion mechanism . at length scales larger than the inverse photon mass",
    ", the long distance effective theory reduce to a njl - type lagrangian of zero mode fermions which is known to possess two phases : a weak coupling unbroken phase and a strong coupling broken phase .",
    "although the strong coupling phase is outside the region of validity of the effective theory , the transition is taking place just at its boundary where @xmath47 . here , @xmath48 is the monopole ( fractional instanton ) action .",
    "the interesting aspect , which is not addressed in @xcite in generality , is that in terms of compactification radius @xmath49 , @xmath4 and @xmath9 , this translates into @xmath50 .",
    "this is also the scale where the non - perturbatively generated photon mass becomes equal to the lightest @xmath51-boson mass @xmath52 and a long distance description based on @xmath44 ceases its validity .",
    "the theory moves from an the abelian confinement to non - abelian confinement regime @xcite . in multi - flavor qcd(adj ) theory , this is associated with a solo chiral phase transition .",
    "there is a deeper reason for the existence of a suppressed chiral transition scale @xmath3 .",
    "the non - perturbative physics of large @xmath4 qcd - like gauge theory is independent of the volume of the @xmath2 so long as the center symmetry is unbroken @xcite .",
    "this is the volume independence property at large @xmath4 , also known as eguchi - kawai reduction . for pure ym , a full ek reduction fails just because the center symmetry breaks spontaneously .",
    "qcd(adj ) with @xmath53 is the first continuum gauge theory example which satisfies the volume independence all the way down to arbitrarily small volumes @xcite , as opposed to the partial reduction discussed in @xcite and other schemes which are recently shown to fail @xcite .",
    "the independence of the physics from the @xmath2 size at @xmath54 limit implies that the chiral symmetry realization and chiral condensate must be independent of @xmath2 radius in qcd(adj ) .",
    "therefore , whatever chiral transition takes place at finite @xmath4 and finite @xmath2 must be pushed to @xmath55 at @xmath54 .",
    "also note that the existence of @xmath44 regime @xcite and the large @xmath4 volume independence @xcite are consistent with each other , because the region of validity of @xmath44 regime is pushed into an arbitrarily narrow sliver as @xmath4 is taken large .    *",
    "iv ) * the ym theory with one adjoint majorana and @xmath56 fundamental dirac fermions all with @xmath53 is in this class . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the theory is just @xmath38 sym .",
    "due to supersymmetry of @xmath57 background , @xmath58 $ ] is @xmath59 where the first non - vanishing contribution is due to @xmath7 fundamental fermions .",
    "the minimum of the @xmath58 $ ] is at @xmath60 and the center is broken at small @xmath2 .",
    "the interesting behavior of this theory is due to the fact that the one loop potential is @xmath61 .",
    "recall from thermal qcd the case in which thermal one - loop potential is @xmath36 that the usual electric mass of the holonomy ( or the @xmath62 field ) is @xmath63 . in our case ,",
    "the mass of the @xmath62 field is anomalously small @xcite @xmath64 in the large @xmath4 limit , @xmath65 and the one loop effective potential seen by the @xmath4 eigenvalues becomes arbitrarily flat .",
    "a classical moduli space opens up at this level of analysis . as in the @xmath38 sym case",
    ", the non - perturbative potential restores the center symmetry .",
    "this means , the chiral and center symmetry transition scales must be suppressed scales relative to @xmath0 .    another way to realize that there must exist a",
    "suppressed chiral and center symmetry transition scale is to use the large @xmath4 volume independence . in the @xmath54 limit",
    ", the sym theory obeys volume independence .",
    "the theory on @xmath66 is nonperturbatively equivalent to the theory on @xmath11 for any finite @xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "( somehow counter - intuitively ) , the @xmath54 limit of @xmath38 sym lacks a weak coupling @xmath67 description at long distances regardless of how small @xmath2 is , so long as it is finite .",
    "the addition of fundamental fermions on small @xmath30 is same as adding fundamental fermions to the theory on @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , at @xmath54 limit , fundamental fermions can not induce a center symmetry breaking in this theory .",
    "* refined ( abelian ) large @xmath4 limit : * for any confining qcd - like gauge theory which remains center symmetric at arbitrarily small @xmath30 , there exists a double - scaled , refined large @xmath4 limit . in this limit , @xmath68 are held fixed .",
    "the short distance is @xmath69 and long distance gauge structure is a @xmath70^{\\infty}$ ] mimicking the @xmath67 structure of the small @xmath4 , small @xmath2 center symmetric theories .",
    "the existence of an abelian large @xmath4 limit was first shown in non - vector - like @xmath71 sym theory @xcite .",
    "realizing that such a limit exists and is generic in qcd - like theories is new .",
    "we expect the refined large @xmath4 limits to be generically solvable as in @xcite .",
    "* a no - go theorem for holographic ( supergravity ) models of qcd : * since supergravity is the classical @xmath54 limit , the small radius phases of the classes iii ) and iv ) are invisible in the holographic modeling of qcd as a result of corollary . in particular , the confinement without chiral symmetry breaking phase and the associated solo chiral transitions are outside the reach of supergravity approximation .",
    "a stringy improvement of holographic models , which incorporates the @xmath72 effects , is needed to find the phase transitions in classes iii ) and iv ) .    confirming this result , the holographic models of qcd so far did not find any confinement without chiral symmetry breaking phase , although chirally asymmetric deconfined phases were found @xcite .",
    "this non - observation can naturally be explained by large @xmath4 volume independence .",
    "it is also tied with  dynamical abelian dominance \" of the refined large @xmath4 limit , one can not describe phases with @xmath73 weakly coupled fields as in @xcite in supergravity approximation @xcite .",
    "* testing on the lattice : * one may wonder why these novel scales are not already seen in lattice gauge theory simulations .",
    "the reason is simple .",
    "so far , there exist no non - thermal lattice simulation for classes iii ) and iv ) . even in the thermal setting ,",
    "the confinement without chiral symmetry breaking phase can be observed as follows : assume the center symmetry is stabilized at small @xmath2 by a double trace deformation @xcite . in multi - flavor theories , there will still be a solo chiral transition from a confined chirally asymmetric to a confined chirally symmetric phase , which will take place at @xmath74 due to similar reasons as in qcd(adj ) . in this sense , the natural scale of chiral transition is again ( [ quantum ] ) . in the thermal qcd ,",
    "this scale is shadowed by the deconfinement transition which occurs around @xmath0 and forces the chiral symmetry to restore @xcite far before @xmath3 .",
    "the simulation of deformed qcd and the quantum phase transitions are feasible by conventional techniques .",
    "* summary : * in any confining qcd - like theory which always remains center symmetric ( either by non - thermal fluctuations or by deformations ) on @xmath11 , the scale @xmath75 is the most important scale . for smaller radius , the long distance theory abelianizes down to @xmath67 and abelian confinement is operative . for larger radius ,",
    "non - abelian confinement is valid . for zero and one flavor theories ,",
    "the abelian and non - abelian confinement regimes are smoothly connected @xcite . for multi - flavor theories",
    ", there must exist a single chiral transition from a chirally symmetric abelian confinement regime to a chirally asymmetric nonabelian confinement regime occurring at @xmath76 .",
    "since the non - abelian confinement and volume independence holds for @xmath77 , and the theory just above this critical radius is equivalent to qcd on @xmath66 up to @xmath78 corrections , understanding the dynamics of qcd in the vicinity of ( [ quantum ] ) may hold the necessary insights into a fuller understanding of the theory .",
