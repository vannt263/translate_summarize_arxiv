    "the principal nest of a quadratic polynomial is a collection of pieces of the puzzle with good shrinking properties ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "we proposed a supplementary construction , the _ frame _ of the nest , to help classify different nest types .",
    "based on that classification , we introduce in this paper the family of @xmath0-recurrent maps .",
    "in essence , these are polynomials for which the nest frames are combinatorially modeled on the puzzle of a chosen critically periodic quadratic polynomial @xmath0 .",
    "we will generalize to the family of @xmath0-recurrent maps some results of m. lyubich and l. wenstrom that concern the real fibonacci parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the central pieces of the nest of @xmath3 are asymptotically similar to the julia set of @xmath4 .",
    "this fact is expanded in @xcite , where the shape of pieces is exploited to compute the exact rate of growth of the principal nest moduli .",
    "wenstrom translates these results to the parameter plane in order to obtain the corresponding shape of parapieces and the rate of paramoduli growth around @xmath2 on the mandelbrot set @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding results for @xmath0-recurrent maps are as follows :    let @xmath6 be the center of a prime component of @xmath5 and @xmath0 its associated quadratic polynomial",
    ". then the nest pieces of a @xmath0-recurrent map converge in shape to the julia set @xmath7 .",
    "the asymptotic shape of pieces is used to derive analytic information about the nest . in the simplest case",
    ", @xmath8 , the family of @xmath9-recurrent maps has an interesting description .",
    "a quadratic polynomial is @xmath9-recurrent if and only if it is complex fibonacci .",
    "moreover , the principal moduli of any map in this family grow linearly with growth rate @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding result is different when the critical point of @xmath0 has period @xmath11 .    for @xmath12 the principal moduli of a @xmath0-recurrent map grow exponentially with a rate that depends on the period of @xmath0 .",
    "when the shape results are translated to the mandelbrot set , the above statements find parametric counterparts .    the paranest pieces around a @xmath0-recurrent parameter @xmath6 converge in shape to @xmath7 .",
    "the growth of paramoduli around @xmath6 is as in the corresponding dynamical plane .",
    "the family of @xmath0-recurrent parameters forms a dyadic cantor set of hausdorff dimension 0 .    as an application of parapiece shape ,",
    "an easy diagonal argument yields a powerful auto - similarity result on @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath13 be two parameters such that @xmath14 has no indifferent periodic orbits that are rational or linearizable .",
    "then there exists a sequence of parapieces @xmath15 converging to @xmath16 as compact sets , but such that @xmath17 converges to @xmath18 in shape .      the puzzle of yoccoz , the principal nest and their parametric counterparts are defined in section [ sect : basics ] as a means to introduce notation .",
    "the adjacency graphs introduced in subsection [ subsect : graphs ] are used in section [ sect : frames ] to define the frame of a principal nest , and in section [ sect : def_q - rec ] to describe @xmath0-recurrent behavior .    in section [",
    "sect : q_recurrency ] we present the classification of complex fibonacci quadratic polynomials and the results on the shape of pieces and growth of moduli for the nest of @xmath0-recurrent maps .",
    "the corresponding results on parametric pieces of the mandelbrot set @xmath5 are presented in section [ sect : parameter_space ] .",
    "theorem [ thm : m_similarity ] introduces a new similarity phenomenon between different locations of @xmath19 .",

    "this yields connectivity of @xmath5 and allows us to define * parametric external rays * and * parametric equipotentials * as in the dynamical case .",
    "since there is little risk of confusion , we will use the same notation ( @xmath58 ) to denote these curves and say that a parametric ray lands at a point @xmath59 if @xmath6 is the only point of accumulation of the ray on @xmath5 .    for the rest of this work , all rays considered , whether in dynamical or parameter plane , will have rational angles .",

    "the motivation for this example is to investigate what properties of @xmath0-recurrent polynomials will hold for parameters that imitate the behavior of ( non - periodic ) postcritically finite maps .",
    "actually , the construction of @xmath687 is very similar to that of @xmath0-recurrent polynomials ; the main difference being as follows . since the critical orbit of @xmath688 does not return to the center , the first return to level @xmath294 must be delayed until after the composition of @xmath108 first return maps @xmath689 , when the critical orbit falls in @xmath123 .",
    "the parameter was chosen so that the first return to level @xmath294 occurs exactly at this moment ; that is , @xmath493 is precisely @xmath690 for all @xmath108 .",

    ", there can not be other real polynomials in this class . + the methods used to work with @xmath0-recurrent polynomials are not enough to study the nest of @xmath687 in a metric sense .",
    "in particular , we have relied on the fact that @xmath7 had a non - empty interior ; this is not the case for @xmath693 .",
    "nevertheless , the analogy is good enough that it is natural to pose the following .",
    "there are suitable rescalings of the nest pieces of @xmath687 such that the functions induced from the first return maps converge to @xmath688 and such that properly rescaled pieces converge to the interval @xmath694 $ ] in the hausdorff topology .",
    "one of the most amazing attributes of complex quadratic dynamics is the replication of dynamical features in the parameter plane .",
    "for instance , the structure of a limb @xmath695 reflects the initial steps of the critical orbit for any parameter contained in it .",
    "in @xcite , tan lei showed that for a strictly preperiodic parameter @xmath6 , the julia set of @xmath1 and the mandelbrot set exhibit local asymptotic similarity around @xmath6 .",
    "as it has been mentioned , a result of similar nature appears in @xcite where wenstrom shows that the paranest pieces around the real fibonacci parameter @xmath2 are asymptotically similar to the central pieces in the principal nest of @xmath3 .",

    "then the paranest around @xmath697 is infinite and the parapieces @xmath698 converge in shape to the filled julia set @xmath7 .",
    "this will require translating the corresponding result obtained in the dynamical plane to the space of parameters . to do this",
