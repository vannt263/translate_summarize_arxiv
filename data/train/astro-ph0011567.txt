    "this corrected peak luminosity succeeds as a standard candle where others fail because ( i ) the extreme luminosity of type  ia sne allows one to probe substantially further into the unperturbed hubble flow ( in comparison with competing secondary indicators such as the tully - fisher relation or surface brightness fluctuations ) , and ( ii ) the intrinsic scatter is smaller than that of other indicators . _ _    calibrating this secondary distance indicator can be approached from a purely theoretical tack ( e.g. , hflich & khokhlov 1996 ) , but the numerous model uncertainties still lead the conservative to favour the empirical calibration .",
    "the _ sandage / tammann / saha type  ia sn hst calibration project ( saha et  al .",
    "1999 ) was designed to provide just such a calibration , by determining the cepheid distances to eight nearby galaxies ( ic  4182 , ngc  5253 , 4536 , 4496a , 4639 , 3627 , 3982 , 4527 ) host to type  ia sne .",

    "( 2000 ) provides a complete list of the galaxies and sne covered by all these calibration programs , including a subjective quality ranking . _    in what follows , we review the steps involved in calibrating the type  ia sne extragalactic distance scale .",

    "_ if the peak luminosity of type  ia sne were a standard candle , one would expect the dispersion of the linear hubble diagram ( magnitude versus redshift ) to be limited only by photometric precision , providing both a precise _ and accurate value for the hubble constant h@xmath0 ( once the zero point was set by calibrating the peak luminosity via nearby sne of _ known distance ) . combining the 50 type  ia sne - corrections employed by hamuy et  al .",

    "( 2001 ; fig  4 ) show that the raw b- , v- , and i - band hubble diagrams are anything but indicative of a standard candle ( e.g. , the dispersion in the b - band corresponds to a dispersion in distance ( and h@xmath0 ) in excess of 40% ) . even upon applying corrections for foreground and host galaxy reddening , and culling the c - t@xmath3cfa samples for low - redshift interlopers ( which are more susceptible to peculiar velocity corrections ) and highly - reddened sne , the resulting dispersion and structure seen in the hubble diagrams ( middle column of fig  4 of freedman et  al .",
    "2001 ) still indicate that an adequate standard candle is not at hand . to provide a useful constraint on h@xmath0 ,",
    "it is clear that these raw hubble diagrams need modification .",
    "_ _ _    as has been well - documented over the past five years ( e.g. , hamuy et  al .",
    "1996 ; riess et  al .",
    "1996 ) , the necessary modification is provided by applying a mild correction to the observed peak magnitudes of the type  ia sne , the size of the correction being a function of the shape of the light curve . in its simplest form ( hamuy et  al .",
    "1996 ) , the observed peak magnitude m@xmath4 ( after correction for line - of - sight reddening ) is modified by a linear function of the sn light curve decline rate @xmath5 , where the latter is a measure of the b - band decline ( in magnitudes ) from the peak of the light curve to 15 days after the peak .",
    "higher - order quadratic fits have also been employed on occasion ( e.g. , suntzeff et  al .",
    "1999 ; phillips et  al . 1999 ; gibson et  al .",
    "2000 ) , as have more sophisticated multicolour light curve shape techniques ( riess et  al . 1996,1998,1999 ) .",
    "all such modifications result in hubble diagram dispersions which correspond to @xmath67% in distance , and are consistent with that expected from the photometric errors alone .",
    "starting with mark phillips ( 2000 ) homogeneous re - analysis of the photometry and light curves for both the c - t and cfa sne samples , we construct our desired b- , v- , and i - band hubble diagrams by enforcing two strict criteria : the sne must be consistent with ( i ) 3.5@xmath7@xmath8@xmath74.5 , and ( ii ) @xmath9b@xmath10v@xmath4@xmath9@xmath110.20 .",
    "this yields a preferred subset of 36 sne for the b- and v - band hubble diagrams , and 32 sne for the i - band . criterion ( i ) is ( essentially ) universally adopted ( for reasons already noted previously ) , and ( ii ) was chosen to mimic that employed by hamuy et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; stricter colour cuts have also been used ( e.g. , phillips et  al . 1999 ) , but they have little impact on the science which follows",

    "a bootstrapped , quadratic , outlier - resistant , fit to the data in each panel ( b- , v- , and i - band , from top to bottom ) was then undertaken , employing the functional form described by equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "the resultant colour - dependent coefficients ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) , their associated uncertainties , and overall dispersion @xmath23 are shown under the heading `` quadratic '' in figure  1 .",
    "a bivariate linear least squares fit was also employed ( effectively forcing coefficient @xmath21 of equation  ( 1 ) to be zero ) , the results for which are also shown in figure  1 adjacent to the heading `` linear '' . while @xmath24@xmath7@xmath25 , the statistical significance of the improved fit is marginal ( as measured by the fisher f - test ) , and is the primary reason why , for example , freedman et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) and gibson & stetson ( 2001 ) reverted to linear fits subsequent to our original quadratic analysis ( gibson et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "regardless , adopting the quadratic fits in lieu of the linear ones has no impact upon the ultimately derived value of the hubble constant .",

    "all permutations led to ( essentially ) identical values for the hubble constant , and so the reader will be spared the painful details .",
    "having generated what appears to be an excellent standard candle ( the corrected peak luminosity of a type  ia sne ) , limited now only by photometric precision , we are left with the set of coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and ( in the case of quadratic fits ) @xmath21 for equation  ( 1 ) , but no immediate value for the hubble constant .",
    "the problem lies in the fact that the corrected peak luminosity is indeed an excellent secondary distance indicator ( i.e. , the corrected hubble diagrams provide accurate _ relative distances ) , but it still needs to be calibrated with nearby sne of _ known distance @xmath30 ( and therefore _ known luminosity m@xmath4 ) .",
