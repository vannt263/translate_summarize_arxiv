    "social contagions , which has attracted much attention in recent years  @xcite .",
    "statistical physics approaches were widely used to investigate social contagions . on the one hand",
    ", scientists used these methods to analyse large databases of social contagions , and revealed that reinforcement effect widely exists  @xcite .",
    "the reinforcement effect means that individual adopting a behavior is based on the memory of the cumulative behavioral information that he / she received from his / her neighbors .",
    "centola established the artificially structured online communities to study health behavior spreading , and found that the reinforcement effect significantly increases the adoption of a new health behavior  @xcite .",
    "the reinforcement effect also exists in the adoptions of facebook  @xcite and skype  @xcite services . on the other hand , researchers proposed some novel models with reinforcement effect to describe the dynamics of social contagions . among these models ,",
    "linear threshold model  @xcite is a famous one , and it is a deterministic model ( i.e. , a trivial case of markovian process ) once the network topology and initial seeds are fixed . in this model , an individual will adopt the behavior once the current fraction of his / her adopted neighbours is larger than a static threshold .",
    "the linear threshold model induces that the final behavior adoption size first grows continuously and then decreases discontinuously with the increasing of mean degree for vanishing small fraction of seeds .",
    "another more realistic way to incorporate the reinforcement effect is whether an individual adopts the behavior should take his / her cumulative pieces of behavioral information into consideration  @xcite . in this case , the dynamics is a non - markovian process , which makes it more difficult to develop an accurate theory .",
    "et al _ proposed a non - markovian behavior spreading model , and found that the dependence of final behavior adoption size on information transmission probability can change from being discontinuous to being continuous under dynamical or structural parameters perturbation  @xcite .",
    "recently , scholars found that individuals exhibit limited contact capacity ( i.e. , individuals can only communicate or interact with a finite number of neighbors during a short time ) since the inelastic resources ( e.g. , time , funds , and energy ) restrict them to dedicate to social interaction from empirical analysis  @xcite . in facebook communication networks , golder _ et al _ revealed that users only communicate with a small number of people even though they have many declared friends  @xcite .",

    "researchers have studied the effects of contact capacity on some markovian dynamics ( i.e. , epidemic spreading )  @xcite .",
    "they found that the epidemic outbreak threshold increases when the contact capacity is limited  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , each connection ( edge ) has distinct effective spreading probability ( to be defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) , which makes the theoretical prediction deviate from simulation results more easily , especially in the case of strong structural heterogeneity .    for the dynamics of social contagions , whether an individual adopts a behavior behavior or not is determined by the cumulative pieces of behavioral information that he / she has received from neighbors  @xcite . once the contact capacity is limited , the behavioral information transmission will be limited , thus further affects the dynamics of social contagions .",

    ", we try to address how the contact capacity affects the behavior spreading dynamics .",
    "we first propose a non - markovian behavior spreading model with limited contact capacity , in which each adopted individual tries to transmit the behavioral information to a finite number of his / her neighbors . in order to understand ,",
    "quantitatively , the effects of contact capacity on behavior spreading , we develop a heterogeneous edge - based compartmental theory .",
    "we find that the final behavior adoption size increases with the contact capacity .",
    "more interestingly , the crossover phenomenon in which the dependence of the final adoption size on the information transmission probability can change from being continuous to being discontinuous . by enlarging the contact capacity ,",
    "the crossover phenomenon can be induced only when the degree exponent is above a critical critical degree exponent .",
    "however , the final adoption size always grows continuously for any contact capacity when degree exponent is below the critical degree exponent .",

    "<S> we first propose a non - markovian behavior spreading model with limited contact capacity . </S>",
    "<S> then , we develop a novel heterogeneous edge - based compartmental theory for this proposed model , and verify the effectiveness of this suggested theory based on large number of simulations . through theory and simulations , we find that the final behavior adoption size increases with the contact capacity . strikingly , we uncover a crossover phenomenon in which the dependence of the final adoption size on the information transmission probability can change from being continuous to being discontinuous . </S>",
    "<S> we find a critical degree exponent above which the crossover phenomenon can be induced by enlarging the contact capacity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the final adoption size always grows continuously for any contact capacity when degree exponent is below this critical degree exponent . </S>",
    "<S> our results help us to have a deeper understanding of the effects of contact capacity on social contagions , and the developed theory could be applied to other analogous dynamical processes ( e.g. , information diffusion and cascading failure ) . * </S>"
