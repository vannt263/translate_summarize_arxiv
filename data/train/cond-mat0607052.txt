    "one must have at hand a reliable theory capturing the salient features of the strong - coupling asymptotics to comprehend fully the effects of electron correlations in metals .",
    "most theoretical approaches are based on the well established weak - coupling expansion and we have only a few opportunities to test its extensions to the strong - coupling regime .",
    "the most reliable check of credibility of a theory in the strong - coupling regime is to compare its results with one of the existing exact solutions in this limit .",
    "there are two principal exact results for strongly correlated electrons .",
    "it is the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) and the @xmath0 hubbard model .",
    "the ground state of both models at half filling was constructed with the aid of the bethe ansatz .",
    "the former is a heavy - fermion liquid in the strong - coupling limit,@xcite while the latter is an electron - hole liquid for arbitrary interaction strength.@xcite    recently siam has won on importance , since its solutions form a fundamental building block in the construction of a dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) of strong electron correlations via the limit to infinite - dimensional lattices.@xcite unfortunately , there are only approximate impurity solvers in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "the only analytic theory , non - crossing approximation , is not a fermi liquid and displays low - energy pathological features.@xcite numerical quantum monte - carlo simulations@xcite are restricted to rather high temperatures .",
    "the most reliable impurity solver proved to be the numerical renormalization group .",
    "it produces the expected three - peak spectral function with the central kondo resonance for intermediate coupling.@xcite due to limitations of the numerical procedure it can not be extended to arbitrarily large interactions .",
    "neither of these solutions , however , is capable to produce a detailed ultimate picture of the the strong - coupling limit and to decide whether and in which form the kondo resonance survives or whether the system undergoes a metal - insulator transition .",
    "this question can only be answered by an analytically controlled theory .",
    "there is presently no global analytic theory capable of tracing down the genesis of the correlation - induced kondo resonance the standard weak - coupling , fermi - liquid - based perturbation expansion renormalized with various self - energy insertions becomes unstable for intermediate and strong electron interaction.@xcite attempts to go beyond one - particle renormalizations by introducing explicit vertex corrections and a two - particle self - consistency either do not lead to analytically solvable equations or have not yet produced the desired kondo asymptotics in siam.@xcite    the aim of this paper is to construct an analytically controllable approximation that would reliably interpolate between the weak- and strong - coupling regimes in models with a screened electron repulsion . to this purpose",
    "we use an appropriately renormalized diagrammatic many - body expansion .",
    "we demonstrate that it is not the one - particle self - consistency but rather a two - particle one that must be introduced in the critical region of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we further show that only a symmetric inclusion of electron - electron and electron - hole scatterings leads to the proper critical behavior .",
    "the two - particle self - consistency will be achieved within the parquet approximation in which we separate singular and regular functions . not to lose analytic control only the potentially divergent functions with long - range fluctuations",
    "are kept dynamical while the regular ones with short - range fluctuations are replaced by constants .",
    "such a simplification does not affect the universal features of the critical behavior .",
    "we explicitly construct the approximation for siam so that its reliability becomes transparent by qualitatively correctly reproducing the exact weak - coupling ( fermi - liquid ) and strong - coupling ( kondo ) regimes .",
    "we identify with our construction the minimal necessary conditions on approximate schemes to cover the kondo strong - coupling behavior .",
    "we formulate the construction of an approximate theory interpolating between the weak and strong coupling regimes independently of the underlying model via renormalized feynman diagrams and equations of motion . to demonstrate reliability of our approach we , however , use in our explicit calculations the single impurity anderson model the hamiltonian of which reads @xmath1 we denoted @xmath2 .",
    "when calculating the grand potential and thermodynamic properties of this impurity model we can explicitly integrate over the degrees of freedom of the delocalized electrons .",
    "to this purpose we standardly replace the local part of the propagator of the mobile electrons by a constant @xmath3 the value of which we set as the energy unit . for simplicity",
    "we assume half - filled case @xmath4 .",
    "the impurity grand partition function can then be represented via a local grassmann functional integral @xmath5 for this integral we can straightforwardly build up the standard weak - coupling ( diagrammatic ) perturbation expansion in powers of the interaction strength @xmath6 ( diagrammatically represented as a vertex ) and the bare propagator , being in the impurity case @xmath7 ( diagrammatically represented as an oriented line ) .",
    "we know that in the particular case of siam the non - renormalized weak - coupling expansion is preferred and converges for arbitrary interaction strength.@xcite to enable a treatment of phase transitions and singularities in more general extended lattice models we have , however , to renormalize the bare expansion .",
    "the fundamental quantity for renormalization in the many - body perturbation expansion is the self - energy . in our approach",
    "we do not use the self - energy as the approximation - generating quantity determined directly from sums of selected ( renormalized ) diagrams .",

    "equations   can be analytically solved ( in an approximate way ) individually for the full vertex @xmath8 by neglecting eq .   and using the irreducible vertices as input .",

    "the irreducible vertices are replaced by the bare interaction .",

    "we use the fact that only equation   develops a pole in simplifying the parquet approximation in the critical region of the metal - insulator transition to an analytically controllable theory .",

    "this replacement is not uniquely defined but the ambiguity has no impact on the qualitative ( universal ) critical behavior of the solution .",
    "we found that the most appropriate way in replacing the full vertex with a constant is to multiply both sides of eq .   with pairs of one - electron propagators @xmath28 from the left and by @xmath29 from the right .",
    "we then average over the fermionic matsubara frequencies with a constraint @xmath30 , conserved during the electron - electron multiple scatterings .",

    "conservation laws are guaranteed in any theory with an approximate self - energy functional containing physical external sources .",

    "a metal - insulator transition must be self - consistent in some way .",
    "self - consistency is necessary for any theory to handle singularities .",

    "the parquet construction offers a very natural way to reach this goal and to treat singularities in the bethe - salpeter equations appropriately .",
    "one - particle self - consistency influences the critical behavior of the two - particle vertex , but it does not offer any direct control of singularities in the bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "it can neither guarantee integrability of singular vertices nor is capable to reproduce the correct critical behavior in the kondo regime .",
    "when used in the parquet approach , the one - particle self - consistency interferes in the control of the two - particle singularities from the bethe - salpeter equations achieved by the two - particle self - consistency . the one - particle self - consistency can hence be used only when appropriately compensated so that it does not significantly affect the two - particle criticality .",
    "this is , however , not the case in the parquet approximation and the non - self - consistent one - particle propagators deliver better results than the self - consistent ones .",
    "to conclude , we derived a global approximation that is analytically tractable , sufficiently simple , and universal .",
    "it can be used in a number of physically interesting situations , including realistic ( multi orbital ) , material specific models as kind of a mean - field theory for models with strong local electron interaction .",
