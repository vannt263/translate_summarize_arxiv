    "chern insulators ( cis )  @xcite exhibit integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) conductance quantization in the absence of the magnetic field due to non - trivial filled band structure with non - zero topological chern number . in the ordinary ( continuum - not on a lattice ) iqhe the uniform external magnetic field defines a characteristic length , i.e. the magnetic length that describes classically speaking  the size of the particle orbit in the magnetic field \" , or better characteristic volume per particle . on the other hand , in model cis ,",
    "i.e. those based on quadratic hamiltonians , there is no obvious way to define such a length .",
    "although one is inclined to consider ci physics as a single particle problem in a varying magnetic field ( in inverse space ) , which we identify with the local berry curvature , this point of view may be questioned since the berry curvature appears to be a gauge non - invariant quantity ( as we will show below ) .",
    "interactions , if relevant , may fix gauge through spontaneous symmetry breaking , i.e. when fermionic bilinears acquire non - zero values . therefore it is not clear if it is always possible to define a local , physical characteristic length in cis .    on the other hand ,",
    "the quantization of the particle volume in the qhe problem inspired the geometric approach to fractional qhe ( fqhe )  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical metric degree of freedom is constrained by the demand that the metric is uni - modular ( this signifies the quantization of the volume , i.e. commensuration of flux and particles ) .",
    "low - lying collective modes are identified with the oscillations in the shape of the characteristic volume , i.e. changes in the metric , and the measure of the density variations is given by a local curvature .",
    "thus it is natural to ask whether this view of qhe phenomena may be extended to the domain of ( fractional)cis given that there is no obvious gauge - invariant local length characterization .    in the ordinary qhe",
    "there is a quantized response of the system where the magnetic length enters together with the characteristic spin of the qhe state  @xcite .",
    "this quantity is hall viscosity and it was explored in the context of dirac based cis in refs .",
    "a non - universal ( dependent on the model parameters ) characteristic length that takes place of the magnetic length in the expression for the iqhe system was identified .",
    "this was achieved considering the system in the presence of a non  trivial geometric background , and analyzing its low - energy , long - wavelength response near dirac points .",
    "inspired by the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite discussed the case of cis based on quadratically dispersing free 2-band ci hamiltonian in the presence of nematic ordering .",
    "the hall viscosity was discussed , a physical ( non - cut - off dependent ) quantity was not given , but one expects that this quantity exists with a characteristic length .",
    "in other words in principle from the physical response we expect to recover a characteristic length and a global , i.e. large scale ( long wavelength ) characterization .",
    "in this paper we will not discuss the response to geometrical perturbations .",
    "instead we will try to understand whether the internal degrees of freedom can be described in geometrical terms .",
    "if this internal  geometrization \" exists its characteristic length should coincide with the characteristic length for the response to the geometrical perturbations .",
    "we will discuss specific 2-band and 3-band ci and ask whether a geometric description of a ci ground state in which the characteristic length plays the role of magnetic length in the expression for the hall viscosity is possible .",
    "we find that in some regions of parameter space a global , geometric characterization with a characteristic length exists .",

    "are discussed with the emphasis on the gauge - invariant berry curvature at dirac point , and its special relationship with the fubini - study ( fs ) metric . after a short overview of the geometric description of fractional qhe in section  [ the geometric description of ( f)qhe - overview ] , in section  [ the geometric description of the ground state of interacting dirac based cis ] the geometric description of the non - interacting ci problem with a zero - flux equation is introduced .",
    "the geometric description of the interacting ci problem was given in terms of a lagrangian that mixes  cyclotron \" and  guiding center \" degrees of freedom .",
    "the form of the lagrangian was later used in section  [ discussion ] for a diagnostics of the characteristic length in agreement with previous studies on the response of the system .",

    "( [ top_part ] ) in detail let us make a few comments .",
    "first we would like to point out that we are describing 2 band problem .",
    "the one band ( i.e. interacting and filled band ) problem is trivial as the density , i.e. occupation number , is constant . in the 2 band problem",
    "the mixing of  cyclotron \" and guiding center degrees of freedom is expected and this motivates the coupling we introduced in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian_ci ] ) .",
    "also we are assuming that the system preserves , despite band mixing , the hall conductance quantization .",
    "we justify this by an assumption that interactions act as small perturbation which do not change the chern number quantization .    we should also comment that we used the same form of the spin connection , eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) , for the dynamical zweibein @xmath142 as for the bloch vector based zweibein , eq .",
    "( [ bloch_zweibein ] ) .",
    "thus we assumed that at any momentum - time point @xmath143 holds ( see section  [ dirac based 2 band cis and the geometric description of the single particle problem ] ) , where @xmath144 is the dynamical berry field , based on the dynamical @xmath145 .",
    "this assumption can be stated differently as a demand that for the dynamical berry curvature @xmath144 and connection @xmath146 the following requirement holds , @xmath147 here @xmath148 is the chern number equal to @xmath149 as in the case without the interactions . then this can be solved ( reduced over the @xmath150 , i.e. two - sphere angle integration ) by taking @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the two - component complex normalized vector field , i.e. we can have @xmath153 .",
    "thus at any point @xmath143 holds and the expression for the spin connection , eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) , follows .",
    "also , in this way , it follows that we consider the space of ( dynamical ) zweibeins which are smoothly connected to those based on bloch vectors in the non - interacting problem .",
    "in eq .  ( [ top_part ] ) the quantity @xmath132 plays the role of the guiding center spin . if the same formalism is applied to the fqhe in the case of ideal laughlin case we would have @xmath154 , compare with eq .",
    "( [ geo_l ] ) . in that case",
    "@xmath155 is the external vector potential of uniform magnetic field and @xmath156 is zero .",
    "if the rotational symmetry is assumed , the coefficient in the lagrangian @xmath157 in the inverse space becomes @xmath158 in the ordinary space .",
    "the coefficient in the ordinary space can be rewritten as @xmath159 and enters the expression for the hall viscosity of guiding centers in fqhe : @xmath160 in this way we might expect fixing @xmath161 that the same formula in the case of cis holds . but first we should carefully examine and compare expressions for the spin connection , @xmath162 in the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ top_part ] ) in both cases , fqhe and ci .",
    "we will study small deformations , i.e. small fluctuations from a flat ground state configuration .",
    "this will just serve as a way to detect the role of the characteristic length in the contribution to the hall viscosity from the internal ( interacting ) degrees of freedom .",
    "namely in the context of fqhe , @xmath163 and @xmath164 are dimensionless quantities and @xmath165 ( uni - modular metric requirement ) . to study the geometry deformations we rewrite @xmath166 in terms of zweibeins @xmath167 and @xmath168",

    "we find @xmath176 on the other hand , in the case of 2 band cis , zweibeins have two components denoted by @xmath83 in @xmath177 .",
    "thus @xmath178 and can be easily found in the long - distance approximation in the dirac case , eqs .",
    "( [ h ] ) and  ( [ vectorh ] ) : @xmath179 we induce deformations as @xmath180 i.e. we make deformations ( study fluctuations ) equal in both sublattices ( otherwise we would make a spin torque transformation  @xcite ) .",
    "here @xmath174 and @xmath175 are small deformation parameters .",
    "taking that @xmath181 in the ground state near expansion point we have for the spin connection , @xmath182 therefore in performing the same deformations we find that there is an extra 2 in the final expression for the spin connection and eventually hall viscosity in the case of cis .",
    "the hall viscosity of the internal degrees of freedom in the inverse space is @xmath183 leading to the hall viscosity in the ordinary space @xmath184 the expression is in the complete agreement with the conclusion of hughes et al .",
    "they found that in the case of dirac based cis the role of the magnetic length is taken by the @xmath61 length in the expression for the hall viscosity .",
    "thus we find that a geometric description of the dirac based haldane model is possible .",
    "that is also true for any dirac based ci , i.e. ci which low - energy description is given by eqs .",
    "( [ h ] ) and  ( [ vectorh ] ) .",
    "the 2-band haldane model is specific in having the property that we can recognize the effective cyclotron orbits in real space by looking at the bloch vector in the expression  ( [ vectorh ] ) .",
    "namely the weight on one of the sublattices is much larger ( in the long distance limit ) than on the other sublattice of the hexagonal lattice . thus if we consider a superposition ( wave packet ) of bloch vectors with gaussians in @xmath2 space as cut - offs : @xmath185 with coordinate @xmath186 , we recognize cyclotron orbit(s ) with @xmath187 as a characteristic length for the size of the orbit . if @xmath188 , i.e. @xmath189 ( lattice constant ) we expect a qh like ( lll like ) description of haldane model based ci . indeed small @xmath57 ( phase of complex hopping )",
    "for which @xmath188 is the condition that characterizes a region of phase space of haldane model ( as shown in ref .",

    "this region is closest to the effective ( gapless ) dirac description and thus , it seems , recovering the hall viscosity with @xmath61 playing the role of magnetic length is expected .",
    "therefore the question is , when we lose the correspondence @xmath190 ( average berry curvature ) or @xmath189 , i.e. for @xmath191 , whether the dirac based description is still appropriate and geometric description is still possible .",
