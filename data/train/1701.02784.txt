    "we seek an integrable @xmath23 on @xmath26 , @xmath27 , assuming that @xmath13 is also integrable if the ambient space is lossy ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the solution for @xmath29 is then obtained via analytic continuation .",
    "we also demonstrate that our solution is in good agreement with a numerical computation based on the finite element method .",
    "details of the underlying numerical method lie beyond our present scope ; the interested reader may consult  @xcite .",
    "physically , the problem at hand is motivated by the need to understand how an spp can be excited by a tm plane wave incident upon a conducting planar sheet with a defect , i.e. , an edge .",
    "our approach yields an integral that connects the relatively rapid spatial variation of the spp with the behavior of the total diffracted field near the edge . in 2d ,",
    "the edge acts as an induced point source which radiates a superposition of plane waves with a wide range of wave numbers ; depending on @xmath17 , these plane waves may selectively enable the requisite phase matching for the excitation of the spp .",
    "the wiener - hopf method singles out their contribution .",
    "in contrast , a plane wave incident on an _ infinite _ , flat conducting sheet _ can not _ excite an spp  @xcite .",
    "to solve the wiener - hopf functional equation , we use assumptions consistent with low - dimensional metamaterials such as graphene .",
    "specifically , the surface impedance , @xmath30 , of the sheet is much larger than the intrinsic impedance of the ambient space  @xcite ; and the imaginary part of @xmath19 is positive . for a slightly lossy ambient medium ,",
    "these hypotheses amount to having  @xcite @xmath31 . by",

    ", one wonders if the wiener - hopf method can be replaced by a simpler scheme in seeking a physically transparent approximation for the tangential electric field which would reveal the spp .",
    "let us heuristically entertain such a scenario of solving  .",
    "the first condition in   suggests that   is amenable to regular perturbations , since @xmath33 and @xmath13 do not depend on @xmath17 ; it is then tempting to solve   by successive iterations , starting with the replacement of @xmath23 by @xmath13 under the integral sign .",
    "this approach has the flavor of the neumann expansion for second - kind fredholm equations  @xcite ; and produces mathematically meaningful terms for @xmath23 if @xmath13 is a plane wave .",
    "however , this regular perturbation fails to _ directly _ produce the spp .",
    "the main reason is that the spp is expected to have a spatial microstructure , which is proportional to the small parameter , @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "this feature calls for applying singular perturbations , e.g. , a suitable two - scale expansion , for @xmath23 .",
    "alternatively , it is plausible to seek approximations of physical optics for the diffracted field ; see section  [ subsec : past ] for a discussion of related past works .",
    "the wiener - hopf method captures the spp by a closed - form expression which is amenable to transparent approximations because of  .",
    "thus , this method does not require any unnecessary , a - priori assumption about the structure of this wave .",
    "at the risk of redundancy , we repeat that the spp naturally arises as a pole contribution to a 1d fourier integral . on the other hand",
    ", direct asymptotic methods may prove useful for a _",
    "finite _ strip of graphene  @xcite .",
    "this problem is not studied in this article .",
    "there is a vast body of works in the diffraction of an electromagnetic or acoustic wave by a half plane .",
    "it is impossible to list them exhaustively .",
    "exact solutions to diffraction problems have been obtained in a limited number of cases .",
    "for example , sommerfeld first solved completely the diffraction of a plane wave from a perfectly conducting half plane via the fresnel integral  @xcite ; see also  @xcite .",
    "this technique has been extended to half planes and wedges with the `` impedance boundary condition '' , i.e. , a linear relation between the tangential electric and magnetic field components , separately on each face of the plane or wedge  @xcite .",
    "alternate approaches to this type of problem via the wiener - hopf functional equation can be found , e.g. , in  @xcite . for comprehensive reviews , the reader may consult  @xcite .    in principle",
    ", the impedance condition expresses a local physical effect different from the condition for a resistive sheet which underlies  .",
    "the latter condition expresses transmission of the tangential field components across the sheet , thus connecting values of the fields on the two sides of the sheet .",
    "however , as pointed in  @xcite , the solution to the problem with impedance conditions can be viewed as a linear superposition of the solution for a resistive sheet and its electromagnetic dual , of the `` magnetically conductive '' sheet , with the magnetic and electric fields interchanged .",
    "thus , the electric current , which is proportional to our @xmath23 , induced on the resistive half plane can be extracted as a particular physical contribution to the current of a suitably chosen problem with impedance boundary conditions .",
    "this approach is pursued in  @xcite with recourse to  @xcite .",
    "our treatment differs from  @xcite in the following three main aspects .",
    "first , our formulation spells out the structure of the corresponding boundary value problem for a conducting sheet via integral equation  , without direct invocation of an impedance condition .",
    "second , we obtain the solution directly , by means amenable to rigor .",
    "in contrast , in  @xcite the author employs a different integral - equation formulation , which amounts to impedance conditions ; and extracts a solution for the resistive sheet implicitly .",
    "hence , in  @xcite the analytical linkage of the derived solution to the underlying boundary value problem for a resistive sheet is not evident .",
    "third , the wiener - hopf method here invokes assumptions tailored to the physics of metamaterial sheets such as graphene ; cf .  .",
    "as a result , a principal ingredient ( split function ) , which depends on the kernel and is needed in the factorization process , is evaluated approximately in terms of a known transcendental function , euler s dilogarithm .",
    "in addition , the spp emerges as part of our solution . on the other hand ,",
    "the requisite split function is expressed in terms of an unresolved integral in past works  @xcite ; also , in those works the spp is apparently not part of the solution",
    ".    we should mention disparate studies that make use of keller s geometric theory of diffraction ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite . in a similar vein ,",
    "approximations of physical optics focus on the construction of high - frequency solutions to maxwell s equations away from the edge  @xcite .",
    "we believe that incorporating the spp into this physical - optics framework requires some prior knowledge of properties of this wave .",
