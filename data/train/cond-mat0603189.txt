    "[ paths ] the oriented vertex model and the the general vertex model simply coincide as the graph allows partitioning in two parts . a simple example of a general vertex model which does not correspond to any oriented case ( the whole family of nodes is not divisible in two groups ) is given by an interconnected triad of vertexes with pair interaction : @xmath45 .",

    "depending on the regime one may expect either dominance of some limited number of shortest loops , or a distributed effect of many loops .",
    "thus , for the viana - bray model @xcite , which contains a large number of short loops , considered in the high - temperature regime , the latter possibility was reported in the formal @xmath196 replica expansion @xcite . the leading correction to the bp expression for the averaged free energy",

    "<S> however , both approaches are very far from being complete and problem - free . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xcite lacks an invariant representation in terms of the partition function . </S>",
    "<S> instead it requires operating with correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the complexity of the equations related to the higher - order corrections rapidly grows with the order . </S>",
    "<S> the complimentary approach of @xcite contains dangerous , since lacking analytical control , divergences ( zero modes ) , which constitutes a very problematic symptom for any field theory . </S>",
    "<S> both @xcite and @xcite focus on the ising pair - wise interaction model . </S>",
    "<S> the extensions of the proposed methods to the most interesting from the information theory viewpoint multi - bit interaction cases do not look straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the approaches of @xcite and @xcite , if extended to higher - order corrections , will result in infinite series . </S>",
    "<S> re - summing the corrections in all orders , so that the result is presented in terms of a finite series , does not look feasible within the proposed techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite we suggested an ultimate way to account for loop corrections to bp . </S>",
    "<S> we represented the partition function for a general discrete statistical model defined on a finite factor graph in terms of a series decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> the most remarkable feature of the suggested exact decomposition , that does not appear within the previous approaches @xcite , is the representation of the partition function as a _ </S>",
    "<S> finite _ ( ! ! ) series with the first term being exactly represented by the bp solution . </S>",
    "<S> all higher - order terms are labeled by generalized loops in the factor graph . </S>",
    "<S> a generalized loop is defined as a possibly branching undirected path in the factor graph that has no loose ends . </S>",
    "<S> each term in the series is represented as a product of local contributions along the loop , each contribution being expressed explicitly in terms of some correlation functions calculated within the bp approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> the present manuscript generalizes and details the approach of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to explaining all technical details of the loop series derivation of @xcite we also provide an alternative approach based on an integral representation for the partition function . </S>",
    "<S> for the integral representation bp appears as a result of applying the saddle - point approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we pay special attention to clarifying the relation between the saddle - point approximation for the integral and the bethe free energy approach of @xcite , as well as between the analysis of the gaussian corrections and the saddle - point . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a technical rationale for a formal gauge transformation in the integral representation for the model partition function ( transformation of variables and decomposition of the integrand in a series ) that results in the loop series expression .    </S>",
    "<S> the integral representation approach is formulated for a bipartite factor graph model @xcite which is a particular case of the general vertex model of @xcite also considered in the manuscript . </S>",
    "<S> for the presentation clarity we introduce a bipartite vertex model , orientable vertex model , that is less general than the general vertex model , yet constitutes a generalization of the bipartite factor graph model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vertex models are more general compared to the bipartite factor graph model and allow a simpler derivation of the loop series using an auxiliary discrete transformation ( discrete fourier transforms ) in place of its integral counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> we actually start the technical part of the paper by describing a simpler and more compact discrete variable representation before turning to a lengthy , still ideologically important , integral ( continuous variables ) counterpart .    the auxiliary degrees of freedoms , </S>",
    "<S> one per the graph edge , introduced within both integral / continious and sum / discreet approaches , possess a gauge symmetry that allows an invariant definition of the bp equation . </S>",
    "<S> gauge transformation corresponding to the symmetry keeps the full expression for the partition function invariant while changing the individual term of the series . </S>",
    "<S> an individual term corresponds to a path on the graph that may generally contain some number of loose ends . </S>",
    "<S> the bp equations can be viewed as conditions for fixing a special gauge that requires all allowed paths ( i.e. those who contribute to the series ) to be nothing but generalized loops that do not contain any loose ends . </S>",
    "<S> for this special gauge the bp approximation is described by the first bare term in the loop series .    the formulation of bp as a gauge fixing condition also allows a clear physical interpretation of the entire approach . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the first bare term of the loop series can be viewed as a  ground state \" that minimizes the bethe free energy with loop corrections being related to certain excited states described as along - the - loops spin flips with respect to the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> such interpretation of the loop series makes our approach similar to the so - called high - temperature expansion , where individual contributions ( diagrams ) also correspond to close loops on the factor graph . </S>",
    "<S> there is , however , a very important key difference between the loop series and the high - temperature expansion . </S>",
    "<S> while the high - temperature expansion starts with a trivial bare term ( just unity in the expansion of the partition function ) the bare term in the loop series is highly nontrivial . </S>",
    "<S> it is represented by the bp approximation that already accounts for some local correlations in the model .    </S>",
    "<S> the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : models ] </S>",
    "<S> we introduce our three basic models : bipartite factor - graph model , orientable ( bipartite ) vertex , and general vertex models . </S>",
    "<S> vertex models are convenient generalizations of the bipartite factor - graph model . in section [ sec : models ] we also state our major result  exact expressions for the models partition functions in terms of finite series , coined loop - series , over closed paths defined in the models graphs . the rest of the paper is devoted to derivations and discussions of these results . straightforward and simple derivation of the loop series for the vertex model is described in section [ sec : ver ] . </S>",
    "<S> bp - equations emerge as a result of a requirement for the finite series representation for the partition function of the model to have the loop - series form ( with no terms , correspondent to a path with loose ends , present ) . in section [ sec : fac ] we derive the loop - series for the factor - graph model via an integral representation . </S>",
    "<S> this derivation is more involved , however we present it here in full as it allows to establish a relation between the loop - calculus and other approaches in theoretical physics , e.g. saddle point analysis . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec : fac ] contains a number of subsections . </S>",
    "<S> integral representation for the partition function of the factor - node model is introduced in subsection [ subsec : int ] . </S>",
    "<S> subsection [ subsec : bethe ] describes the relation of the integral representation to the bethe free energy variational approach of @xcite . the latter is also briefly sketched in appendix [ app : bethe ] . in subsection </S>",
    "<S> [ subsec : sp ] we present an approximate saddle - point analysis of the integral representation for the partition function of the factor - graph model . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the saddle - point is described by the bp equations . </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian approximation around the bp saddle - point is discussed in subsection [ subsec : gauss ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the derivation of the exact loop - series via the integral representation is described in subsection [ subsec : loopint ] . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec : con ] is devoted to conclusions where we also discuss possible generalizations as well as practical utility of the loop - series / caclulus in information / computer science and statistical physics . appendix [ app : single ] illustrates the loop calculus on a simple example of two bits , two checks bipartite factor graph model with single loop . </S>"
