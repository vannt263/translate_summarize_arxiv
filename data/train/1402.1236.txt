    "the flavor structure of the nucleon sea can provide new insight on the nature of qcd at the confinement scale .",
    "perturbative qcd predicts a largely flavor symmetric @xmath5 sea , as the @xmath6 process , in which a gluon split into a quark antiquark pair ( @xmath7 ) , is insensitive to the current - quark masses of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are small relative to the qcd scale .",
    "indeed , in the 1980s , it was commonly assumed that the nucleon s sea is @xmath5 flavor symmetric , notwithstanding the fact that ideas based on meson - cloud  @xcite , pauli - blocking  @xcite , and intrinsic sea  @xcite , already led to predictions of a flavor asymmetric nucleon sea .",
    "we emphasize that the term  flavor asymmetry \" does not imply that any fundamental symmetry principle is violated , it merely refers to the differences between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 sea quark distributions in the proton .",
    "the earliest evidences for a flavor asymmetric nucleon sea came from the observation of possible violation of the gottfried sum rule , suggesting @xmath12 , and the charm production in neutrino - induced deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , showing that strange quark sea is suppressed relative to the up and down quark seas .",
    "this topics continues to attract intense theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "we discuss some recent progress in our understanding of the flavor structure of the nucleon sea .",
    "we first present the recent analysis which leads to a determination of the intrinsic sea components for @xmath13 , and @xmath11 in the proton .",
    "we then discuss some recent effort to interpret the flavor structure and momentum dependence of sea quark distributions in the context of connected and disconnected seas in the framework of lattice qcd .",
    "brodsky , hoyer , peterson , and sakai ( bhps ) proposed some time ago that the @xmath14 five - quark fock state in the proton can lead to enhanced production rates for charmed hadrons at forward rapidity region  @xcite . the @xmath15 component in the @xmath14 configuration is coined  intrinsic \" sea in order to distinguish it from the conventional  extrinsic \" sea originating from the @xmath16 qcd process .",
    "the maximal probability for the @xmath17 fock state occurs when all five quarks move with similar velocities .",
    "the larger mass of the charmed quark implies that the @xmath18 and @xmath19 quarks would carry a large fraction of proton s momentum .",
    "this leads to the expectation that the intrinsic charm has a momentum distribution which is valence - like , peaking at relatively large @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the extrinsic charm , which results from gluon splitting , is dominant at the small @xmath0 region .",
    "while some tentalizing evidences for inrinsic charm have been reported , a study by the cteq collaboration  @xcite concluded that the existing data are not yet sufficiently accurate to confirm or refute the existence of intrinsic charm .",
    "r70 mm     it is natural to pose the question ,  are there any evidences for intrinsic sea of lighter quarks , i.e. , the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 fock states ? \" . in the bhps model , the probability for the @xmath23 fock state is expected to be roughly proportional to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the mass of quark @xmath26 .",
    "this suggests significantly larger probabilities for these light - quark intrinsic sea than for the intrinsic charm .",
    "therefore , it is potentially easier to find evidences for these light - quark intrinsic sea .",
    "the challenge , however , is to come up with ways to disentangle the intrinsic sea from the more abundant extrinsic sea .    in a recent attempt to search for evidences for intrinsic light - quark sea ,",
    "two approaches were adopted in order to disentangle the intrinsic from the extrinsic sea  @xcite .",
    "the first approach is to select experimental observables which have either very little or no contributions from the extrinsic sea .",
    "the other approach is to rely on the different dependences for the intrinsic and extrinsic seas .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the intrinsic sea is valence - like and is more abundant at large @xmath0 while the extrinsic sea is dominant at the small @xmath0 region .",
    "one example of an observable free from the contribution of the extrinsic sea is @xmath27 .",
    "the perturbative @xmath6 process is expected to generate @xmath28 and @xmath29 pairs with equal probability and would have no contribution to @xmath27 .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath27 data from the fermilab e866 drell - yan experiment  @xcite in comparison with the calculation using the bhps model .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 are predicted to have identical @xmath0 dependence if @xmath32 .",
    "the exact values for the probabilities of the @xmath21 and @xmath20 configuration , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are not predicted by the bhps model and must be determined from experiments .",
    "however , the difference between @xmath33 and @xmath34 is known from the moment of @xmath27 , namely ,    @xmath35    where the moment is evaluated using the @xmath27 data from the fermilab e866 experiment .",
    "figure 1 compares the @xmath27 data with the calculation ( dashed curve ) using the bhps model and the constraint given by eq .",
    "the bhps calculation is in apparent disagreement with the @xmath27 data .",
    "however , the relevant scale , @xmath36 , for the bhps model calculation is at the confinement scale , which is much lower than the @xmath37 gev@xmath38 scale of the e866 data .",
    "it is therefore necessary to evolve the bhps result from the initial scale to @xmath37 gev@xmath38 .",
    "figure 1 shows that good agreement between the calculation ( solid curve ) and the data is achieved when the initial scale is chosen as @xmath39 gev .",
    "note that an even better agreement with the data is obtained by lowering the initial scale to @xmath40 gev .",
    "r70 mm     an example for identifying the intrinsic sea component by making use of its valence - like @xmath0 distribution has been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the extraction of @xmath41 from a measurement of charged kaon production in semi - inclusive dis by the hermes collaboration  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing feature of fig .",
    "2 is that the strange sea falls off rapidly with @xmath0 for @xmath42 , and becomes a broad peak at the large @xmath0 region .",
    "the hermes result suggests the presence of two distinct components of the strange sea , one at the small @xmath43 region and another centered at the larger @xmath0 region .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the expectation that extrinsic and intrinsic seas have dominant contributions at small and large @xmath0 region , respectively . a comparison between the data and calculations using the bhps model is shown in fig . 2 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 gev .",
    "the data at @xmath44 are quite well described by the calculations , supporting the interpretation that the @xmath45 in the valence region is dominated by the intrinsic sea . from the normalization of the bhps calculations shown in fig .",
    "2 , one can extract the probability of the @xmath46 as @xmath47     with calculations .",
    "the solid and dashed curves are obtained by evolving the bhps model calculation to @xmath48 gev@xmath38 from @xmath49 gev and @xmath40 gev , respectively.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    another quantity which is largely free from the extrinsic sea is @xmath50 . under the assumption that the perturbative @xmath6 process leads to @xmath5 flavor symmetric sea ,",
    "only the intrinsic sea component can contribute to @xmath50 .",
    "from the hermes measurement of @xmath51 and the @xmath52 from the cteq6.6 pdf  @xcite , we obtain @xmath53 as shown in fig .",
    "3 . we note that chen , cao , and signal  @xcite have also examined this quantity earlier in the context of the meson - cloud model .",
    "figure 3 shows a remarkable feature that the @xmath54 distribution is valence - like and peaking at @xmath55 .",
    "one can compare it with the bhps model calculation using the following expression @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath0 distribution of @xmath58 in the @xmath59 fock state .",
    "since the quantity @xmath60 is flavor non - singlet , it can be readily evolved from the initial scale @xmath36 to @xmath61 gev@xmath38 .",
    "figure 3 shows a good agreement between the bhps model calculation and the data . from the comparison between the bhps calculations and the data shown in figs . 1 - 3 , the probabilities for the @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 fock states can be determined as follows ( using @xmath39 gev ) : @xmath65",
    "it is remarkable that the existing data on @xmath27 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 not only provide a test of the bhps model on the intrinsic sea , but also allow an extraction of the probabilities of various five - quark fock states involving light antiquarks .",
    "this result could also be extended to possible future studies on some related topics .",
    "some examples of these topics include :    * search for intrinsic charm and beauty . from the expectation that the probability for the @xmath68 fock state is proportional to @xmath24 and from the values listed in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , one can readily estimate that the probability for the intrinsic charm @xmath69 fock state , @xmath70 , to be roughly @xmath71 , which is smaller than earlier estimate  @xcite .",
    "therefore , future measurements with higher precision , possibly at rhic and lhc , would be very valuable . * search for intrinsic gluons .",
    "the fock state @xmath72 would provide a valence - like gluon component in the proton  @xcite .",
    "it remains a challenge to identify experimental signatures for such valence - like gluons .",
    "* spin and transverse - momentum dependent obsevables of intrinsic sea .",
    "only the spin - averaged distributions for the intrinsic sea has been considered so far .",
    "it would be very interesting to explore the implications of intrinsic sea on the spin - dependent and possibly transverse - momentum dependent parton distributions of the proton .",
    "* intrinsic sea for mesons and hyperons .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the formulation for the nucleon s intrinsic sea to the cases for mesons and hyperons .",
    "the presence of these valence - like seas could affect , for example , the meson- or hyperon - induced drell - yan cross sections in the forward rapidity region . * connection between the intrinsic sea and other models .",
    "it is important to understand the similarities and differences between the bhps intrinsic sea model and other theoretical models such as the meson - cloud model  @xcite and the multi - quark model  @xcite .",
    "some recent study  @xcite has been carried out to elucidate the connection between the intrinsic / extrinsic seas and the connected / disconnected seas in the lattice qcd formulatio , as discussed next .",
    "in order to gain further insight on the flavor structure of the nucleon sea , we note that , according to the path - integral formalism of the hadronic tensor , there are two distinct sources of nucleon sea , namely , the connected sea ( cs ) and the disconnected sea ( ds ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the two diagrams for the connected and disconnected seas . in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) , the quark line propagating backward in time between @xmath73 and @xmath74 corresponds to the connected - sea antiquarks @xmath75 or @xmath76 , which have the same flavors as the valence quarks .",
    "figure 4 ( b ) shows the ds component @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "these two different sources of sea quarks have distinct quark flavor and @xmath0-dependence  @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath30 and @xmath31 seas can originate from both the cs and ds , only ds is present for the @xmath80 and @xmath81 sea . at the small-@xmath0 region , the cs and ds",
    "are also expected to have different @xmath0 dependences .",
    "since only reggeon exchange occurs for cs , one expects @xmath82 at small @xmath0 .",
    "the presence of pomeron exchange implies that @xmath83 at small @xmath0 .",
    "the distinct @xmath0 dependences of cs and ds remain to be checked experimentally .",
    "since @xmath9 and @xmath11 sea is entirely originating from the ds , the hermes measurement of @xmath66 provides valuable information on the shape of the @xmath0 dependence for the ds , which is not yet available from lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 seas contain contributions from both the cs and ds .",
    "it is of interest to separate these two components . a first attempt to separate the cs from the ds",
    "was reported for the @xmath84 sea using the following approach  @xcite .",
    "first , a plausible ansatz that @xmath85 is proportional to @xmath86 ( or equivalently , @xmath66 , since only ds contributes to strange sea ) is adopted .",
    "a recent lattice calculation  @xcite gives the ratio @xmath87 for the moment of the strange quarks over that of the @xmath30 plus @xmath31 for the disconnected diagram as @xmath88 therefore , one can readily separate the cs and ds components for @xmath89 as follows : @xmath90 and @xmath91    figure 5 shows the decomposition of @xmath52 into the cs and ds components , using eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 dependences for cs and ds are very different and are in qualitative agreement with the expectation discussed earlier .",
    "this agreement lends support to the ansatz and approach adopted in this analysis .     into the connected sea ( cs ) and the disconnected sea ( ds ) components using the procedure described in the text .",
    "the ct10 parametrization of @xmath52 is also shown . ]     over @xmath84 versus @xmath0 at @xmath92 gev@xmath38 from various recent pdfs  @xcite . ]    from fig .",
    "5 one could also calculate the momentum fractions carried by the cs and ds .",
    "it is interesting that the momentum fraction of the @xmath93 is roughly equally divided between the cs and ds at @xmath48 gev@xmath38 .",
    "we also note that in a very recent work  @xcite , the possible sign - change of @xmath27 at @xmath94 as well as a qualitative explanation for this sign - change in the context of lattice qcd are discussed .",
    "the formulation of cs and ds can also explain qualitatively the @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath95 ratio .",
    "figure 6 shows the ratio @xmath96 from some recent pdf sets  @xcite .",
    "while @xmath96 is roughly constant at the small @xmath0 region , it falls with increasing @xmath0 in the region @xmath97 . at small @xmath0 ,",
    "the ds component is expected to dominate , due to its @xmath98 dependence .",
    "therefore , it is expected that @xmath99 at small @xmath0 , according to the lattice qcd calculation for the ds  @xcite .",
    "the recent measurement of @xmath100 and @xmath101 boson productions in @xmath102 collision at 7 tev by the atlas collaboration gives @xmath103 at @xmath104 to be @xmath105  @xcite .",
    "both the cteq6.6 and atlas result are consistent with a roughly @xmath5 flavor symmetric sea at small @xmath0 . at the larger @xmath0 region ,",
    "the valence - like cs can contribute to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , but not to @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "this results in smaller values of @xmath96 at larger @xmath0 .",
    "it is expected that future @xmath100 and @xmath101 production data as well as semi - inclusive kaon production data would further improve our knowledge on the @xmath0 dependence of the strange quark sea .",
    "in summary , we have generalized the bhps model to the light - quark sector and compared the model calculations with the @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath60 data .",
    "the qualitative agreement between the data and the calculations provides strong evidence for the existence of the intrinsic @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath9 quark sea .",
    "this analysis also allows the extraction of the probabilities for these fock states .",
    "the concept of connected and disconnected seas in lattice qcd offers new insights on the flavor and @xmath0 dependences of the nucleon sea .",
    "ongoing and future drell - yan ( and @xmath110 production ) and semi - inclusive dis experiments will provide new information on the flavor structure of the nucleon sea ."
