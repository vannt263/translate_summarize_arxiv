    "purification is one of the basic tools in quantum information science  @xcite : given a mixed quantum system @xmath4 described by a density matrix @xmath0 it is possible to introduce another ancillary system @xmath5 , such that the state @xmath2 of the composite system @xmath6 is a pure state and @xmath0 is recovered after partial tracing over @xmath5 : @xmath7 .",
    "the ancillary system may be a physical environment that must be taken into account when doing experiments on the system @xmath4 , but not necessarily so .",
    "it may be a fictitious environment that allows us to prove interesting results about the system under investigation .",
    "purification is a tool of great value in quantum information science , with countless applications , for instance in the study of the distance between quantum states  @xcite , of the geometry of quantum states  @xcite and of the quantum capacity of noisy quantum channels  @xcite . besides its theoretical relevance",

    "the purification state @xmath2 of a density matrix @xmath0 can not be uniquely defined , as any unitary transformation @xmath8 acting non - trivially on the ancillary system only maps the state @xmath2 into a new state @xmath9 which is again a purification of @xmath0 . in this paper , we propose a quantum protocol that selects a specific purification @xmath2 .",
    "such purification turns out to be very convenient since the state @xmath2 depends on a number of parameters exactly equal to the number of degrees of freedom of a generic mixed state @xmath0 and is easily determined as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we design a quantum circuit given by a sequence of quantum gates acting on both the system and the ancillary qudits .",
    "the parameters which determine such quantum gates can be tuned to generate , once the ancillary qubits are disregarded , any mixed state @xmath0 of system @xmath4 .",
    "finally , our protocol works for any system of @xmath1 qudits and requires @xmath1 ancillary qudits .",
    "we show that the number of ancillary qudits is optimal , that is , it can not be reduced if we wish to design a quantum circuit capable of generating any @xmath1-qudit mixed state .",

    "this purification procedure requires the diagonalization of the density matrix @xmath0 and therefore is in general only numerically feasible .    in what follows ,",
    "we propose a different purification scheme , which is optimal in that , for the purification of a generic @xmath1-qudit state , the number @xmath24 of qudits of the ancillary system @xmath5 can not be reduced . while this is the case also for the well - known purification ( [ eq : spectralpur ] ) based on the spectral decomposition ( [ dmatdiag ] ) , we anticipate that our method readily provides a purification state @xmath2 that depends on a number of parameters exactly equal to the number of degrees of freedom of a generic @xmath0 .",
