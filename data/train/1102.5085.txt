    "consider the probability @xmath35 for element a to not belong to the giant component .",
    "a is not a member of the giant component only if all of a s neighbors are also not members , so @xmath35 satisfies the self - consistency condition @xmath36 .",
    "the size of the giant component is then @xmath37 .",
    "consider a random module c and then a random member element a. let @xmath38 be the probability that c is connected to @xmath39 modules , including itself , through element a , who was originally connected to @xmath2 modules including c : @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( notice that @xmath42 when @xmath43 for all @xmath3 . ) the generating function @xmath44 for the number of modules that c is connected to , including itself , through a is @xmath45 once again , averaging @xmath44 over memberships gives @xmath46 the total number of modules that c is connected to is _ not _ generated by @xmath47 but by @xmath48 , where the @xmath49 are the generating functions for module size after elements fail : @xmath50 the probability @xmath51 to have @xmath16 member elements remaining in a module after percolation is given by @xmath52 the denominator is necessary for normalization since we can not observe modules with fewer than @xmath53 members .",
    "notice that @xmath54 when @xmath30 and @xmath55 .",
    "finally , the total number of modules connected to c through any member elements is generated by @xmath56 and the total number of modules connected to a random neighbor of c is generated by @xmath57 .",
    "as before , the module network has a giant component when @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath35 satisfies @xmath60 .    for the uniform case with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , the critical point for the module network",
    "is @xmath64 , a considerably higher threshold than for the element network ( @xmath65 ) . in fig .  [",
    "fig : results ] we show @xmath22 for @xmath32 and @xmath66 .",
    "the `` robustness gap '' between the element and module networks widens as the module failure cutoff increases , covering a significant range of @xmath9 for the larger values of @xmath7 .    of particular interest",
    "are scale - free networks  @xcite . here",
    "we take @xmath29 as before , but now @xmath67 , with @xmath68  .",
    "it is known that scale - free networks are robust to random failures when @xmath69 ( meaning that @xmath70 ) .",
    "however , this result also requires that the maximum value @xmath71 of the degree distribution be large ( @xmath72 )  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "as we lower @xmath73 , we discover that , while we increase the robustness of the elements , we actually _ decrease _ the robustness of the modules ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scalefree ] ) . for modular networks",
    ", it may not be feasible to build extremely large modules . interestingly , enforcing on @xmath1 a maximum module size cutoff @xmath74 only improves element robustness .",
    "we study failures in multiple social , biological , and informational real - world datasets ( see app .",
    "[ app : datasets ] ) . unlike the model",
    ", we do not know the modules in advance , so we estimate them with an overlapping community algorithm  @xcite ( a second method  @xcite displays similar behavior ) .",
    "these networks tend to be smaller than those previously discussed , introducing finite - size effects that mask the behavior of @xmath22 . to overcome this , we instead use @xmath75 , the fraction of _ original _ nodes that remain in the giant component ( see app .",
    "[ app : finitesize ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : realworld ] , the modules fall apart more easily than the elements , qualitatively matching our model across a broad range of networks .",
    "there are a number of interesting avenues for further work .",
    "we considered the simplest case of random failures but extensions to purposeful attacks ( failure proportional to @xmath3 or @xmath2 ) are also important .",
    "likewise , the model we use assumes that all links exist within modules , but links between modules are certainly possible .",
    "these additional links can only enhance the robustness of the element network , but will not improve the module network , so that the robustness gap may be significantly increased . beyond structural characteristics of these modular networks",
    "it is important to understand the effect of failures and modular structure on critical phenomena such as synchronization @xcite , contact processes @xcite , cascades  @xcite or other dynamics  @xcite .",
    "finally , this work can also help us to understand how empirical networks are affected by _ missing data _ , of critical importance when studying communities .",
    "here @xmath9 is the probability that a network element is successfully captured by an experiment , such as a high - throughput biological assay or web crawler .",
    "the robustness gap can explain how non - overlapping community methods may succeed in networks where overlap is expected : the network is sampled down to the intermediate regime where nodes are connected but modules are uncoupled .",

    "the authors acknowledge the center for complex network research , supported by the james s. mcdonnell foundation , the nsf , nih , us onr and arl , dtra , and nkth nap .",
    "in this work , we study six empirical networks .",
    "the word association , metabolic , and protein - protein interaction ( all ) networks were previously used in  @xcite ; details are available there .",
    "the web links network is constructed from a web crawl made available by google ; see http://google.com / programming - contest/. the collaborations network is constructed between authors who share at least one publication on the arxiv : cond - mat system @xcite .",
    "the brain network was derived using normal patient fmri data where each node is a `` voxel '' dividing the brain spatially and links exist between voxels whose respective bold time series are correlated ( measured using normalized mutual information ) .",
    "we begin with the top 200k most correlated links .",
    "a single voxel had very high degree , @xmath76 ( the next highest degree is @xmath77 ) so we first remove it .",
    "this leaves 5038 nodes and 196311 links .",
    "we further preprocess this dense network by extracting its multiscale backbone @xcite ( @xmath78 ) , giving a final network of 5038 nodes and 77680 links . for all networks ,",
    "link communities were extracted at the level of maximum partition density  @xcite , providing the estimated modules .",
    "for the empirical networks analyzed in fig .",
    "[ fig : realworld ] , we modified our definition of the quantity @xmath22 due to finite - size effects .",
    "there are two sources for these effects : ( i ) the number of modules is often much smaller than the number of elements , so that a small network of a few thousand elements may only have a few hundred modules ; and ( ii ) the rate at which elements fail may be slower than the rate at which modules fail ( the former is simply given by @xmath9 but the latter also depends on @xmath1 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "we suppress these effects by choosing @xmath22 with a well - behaved denominator as @xmath79 .",
    "specifically , our options are @xmath80 or @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the number of nodes ( either elements or modules ) within the largest component at percolation probability @xmath9 and @xmath83 is the total number of nodes at percolation probability @xmath9 .",
    "the quantity @xmath75 has better behavior under the above conditions , although the transition appears less dramatic than it does for @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : realworld_sorig ] we present the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : realworld ] using the original definition of @xmath22 ."
