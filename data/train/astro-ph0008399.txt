    "<S> starting from the helmholtz free energy we calculate analytically first- and second - order derivatives , as internal energy and specific heats , for the ideal system and the exchange and correlation interactions covering a broad range of degeneracy and relativity . </S>",
    "<S> the complex physics of coulomb interactions is expressed by pad approximants , which reflect the actual state of our knowledge with high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we assume complete ionization and provide a base system of thermodynamical functions from which any other thermodynamical quantities can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> we chose for the base system the free energy , the pressure , the internal energy , the isothermal compressibility ( or density exponent ) , the coefficient of strain ( or temperature exponent ) , and the isochoric specific heat . by means of the latter potentials entropy , isobaric specific </S>",
    "<S> heat and adiabatic temperature gradient can be determined . </S>",
    "<S> we give comparisons with quantities which are composed by numerical second - order derivatives of the free energy and show that numerical derivatives of the free energy as calculated , for instance , from eos tables , may produce discontinuities for astrophysically relevant quantities as , e.g. , the adiabatic temperature gradient . </S>",
    "<S> adiabatic temperature gradients are shown for different chemical compositions ( hydrogen , helium , carbon ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally the used formalism of pad approximants allows immediate incorporation of recent results from many particle statistics . </S>"
