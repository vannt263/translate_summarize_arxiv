    "during the last years there has been much effort devoted to the study of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the interest has been maintained by the behavior displayed by the high-@xmath5 copper - oxide compounds since the discovery of their superconductivity 15 years ago@xcite .",
    "there are a number of features exhibited by these materials that do not fit into the conventional theoretical frameworks .",
    "the normal state of the cuprates shows for instance unusual transport properties and , more strikingly , a pseudogap phase in which part of the density of states is lost at the fermi level while the system remains conducting .",
    "it seems that a new paradigm is needed to describe these materials , in the same way as the fermi liquid picture accounts for the behavior of conventional metals .    from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "progress has been made during the past decade in understanding the foundations of landau s fermi liquid theory and , consequently , the possible deviations that may open the way to a new kind of metallic behavior@xcite .",
    "the most powerful method used in this task has been the renormalization group ( rg ) approach developed for interacting fermion systems@xcite .",
    "we have learned from it that the fermi liquid picture is a very robust description of the metallic state .",
    "there are only a few perturbations that may destabilize the fermi liquid , favoring the formation of states with different types of symmetry breaking .",
    "the fermi liquid represents itself a universality class in which any electron system falls at dimension @xmath6 , unless the interaction is sufficiently long - ranged@xcite or the fermi surface develops singular points@xcite .",
    "soon after the discovery of the high-@xmath5 superconductivity , it was proposed that the presence of nonlinear dispersion near the fermi line of the copper - oxide layers could be at the origin of the unconventional behavior@xcite .",
    "the fermion systems in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice have necessarily saddle - points in their band dispersion , which give rise to van hove singularities where the density of states diverges logarithmically . in the most common instances ,",
    "the two inequivalent saddle - points lie at the boundary of the brillouin zone , and their hybridization has been proposed to explain the existence of a @xmath4-wave order parameter in the superconducting phase@xcite , as observed experimentally .",
    "further investigations have shown that the unconventional transport properties in the normal state may be accounted for by the proximity of the fermi level to the van hove singularity ( vhs ) in the copper - oxide layers@xcite .",
    "a careful examination of the kinematics near the saddle - points has shown indeed that a superconducting instability with @xmath4-wave order parameter arises in the @xmath7 hubbard model with bare repulsive interaction@xcite .",
    "the mechanism at work is of the same kind described by kohn and luttinger as giving rise to a @xmath8-wave pairing instability in the three - dimensional fermi liquid@xcite , but adapted now to the 2d model with saddle - points near the fermi line .",
    "other studies have considered in detail the influence of the entire fermi line in the development of the instabilities of the system@xcite .",
    "they have given further support to the picture of a competition between a spin - density - wave instability and a pairing instability with @xmath4-wave order parameter in the @xmath7 hubbard model with the fermi level at the vhs .",
    "more recently , a refined renormalization program has been implemented in ref . by trying to handle the momentum dependence of the vertex functions in the scaling procedure , what has confirmed the appearance of different phases with symmetry breaking in the spin and the charge sector .    despite all the results obtained in the system of electrons near the vhs",
    ", there are still important obstacles precluding a precise description of the effective theory at low energies . from a technical point of view",
    ", the source of the problem is the appearance of infrared singularities in the rg approach after accomplishing the renormalization of the leading logarithm .",
    "some vertex functions , like the four - point interaction with vanishing total incoming momentum at the one - loop level or the electron self - energy at the two - loop level , get @xmath9 corrections in terms of the energy cutoff @xmath10 . after applying the standard rg program , the renormalized quantities still contain factors of the form @xmath11 .",
    "this fact questions the predictability of the theory since the argument of the logarithm has a hidden energy scale , which sets the strength of the corrections . from a formal point of view",
    ", the theory becomes nonrenormalizable in the standard rg approach , since the energy cutoff is not the only dimensionful variable that appears in the scaling process .",
    "the problem of the renormalizability of the theory can be best handled by adopting a wilsonian rg approach , in which only the high - energy modes that live at the cutoff @xmath10 are integrated out at each rg step . in the present paper",
    "we follow shankar s rg program for interacting fermion systems@xcite , which has the advantage of decoupling the renormalization of the bcs channel ( with vanishing momentum of the colliding particles ) from that of the rest of the channels at the one - loop level .",
    "moreover , the important feature of the wilsonian approach is that it allows to set free the chemical potential , so that it can readjust itself at each step of integration .",
    "the issue of the renormalization of the chemical potential has been discussed in ref . in the context of fermi liquid theory , and it reaches great significance when considering the system of electrons near the vhs . the chemical potential can not be fixed at the singularity from the start , since it is actually the scale needed to regularize the infrared singularities that appear in the standard rg procedure . on the other hand ,",
    "the final location of the chemical potential relative to the vhs is not arbitrary , since it is a dynamical quantity that scales in a predictable way upon renormalization .",
    "we remark that the renormalization devised in the paper assumes a constant value of the bare chemical potential , instead of a constant particle number of the system .",
    "that is , we describe a situation appropriate for an electron system in contact with a charge reservoir , which sets the nominal value @xmath12 of the ensemble .",
    "the renormalization accounts for the reduction suffered by the effective chemical potential _ inside _ the electron system due to the repulsive interaction",
    "this description of the electron system at constant nominal chemical potential is most appropriate when dealing with the cu - o layers of the cuprate superconductors , since it provides a realization of the contact of the 2d layers with the charge reservoir .",
    "the conclusion is that a variation in the external chemical potential does not have always a linear correspondence with the variation of the final renormalized value of @xmath13 , which is identified with the fermi energy of the electron system .",
    "the renormalization of the chemical potential makes possible to address the question of the naturalness of the picture in which the fermi level is fine - tuned to the vhs .",
    "the strength of the predicted instabilities depends crucially on the proximity of the fermi energy to the singularity .",
    "this has been the main criticism to the proposals claiming that the features of the copper - oxide materials could be related to the properties of electrons interacting near a vhs .",
    "we will show that the chemical potential is renormalized towards the vhs in a certain range of filling levels , in such a way that it may become pinned to the singularity in the low - energy theory .",
    "this fact was already anticipated in refs . , and , and it has been used to cure the infrared singularities of the electron self - energy in ref . .",
    "in the present paper , we will take into account such an effect to determine in a predictable way the strength of the pairing instability in the system , as a function of the different values of the bare chemical potential .",
    "in the next section we describe the system to which our analysis applies . in section iii",
    "we classify the different renormalized vertices that arise by explicit consideration of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the universality classes of the system are obtained in section iv , where we also show the way in which the su(2 ) spin invariance is preserved along the rg flow .",
    "section v is devoted to establish the properties of the spin instability of the system , while section vi analyzes the renormalization of the chemical potential to determine the region of the phase diagram in which the superconducting instability prevails .",
    "finally , the last section is devoted to draw the main conclusions of this work .",
    "we take as starting point of our analysis a system of interacting electrons in the 2d square lattice with nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath14 and next - to - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath15 .",
    "the band dispersion of the model is given by @xmath16 where we have set the lattice spacing equal to one .",
    "some of the energy contour lines are shown in fig .",
    "[ saddle ] .",
    "the dispersion has two inequivalent saddle - points @xmath17 and @xmath18 at the boundary of the brillouin zone . in their neighborhood",
    ", the energy of the one - particle states can be approximated by the quadratic form @xmath19 where the momenta @xmath20 and @xmath21 measure now small deviations from @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    as a consequence of the nonlinear character of the dispersion , the density of states @xmath22 diverges logarithmically at the level of the saddle - points @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "this implies that , when the fermi level is close to the vhs , most part of the low - energy states are concentrated in the neighborhood of the two saddle - points . in order to apply the rg approach ,",
    "we may take two patches where the quadratic approximation ( [ qua ] ) holds around the saddle - points .",
    "higher - order corrections to the expression ( [ qua ] ) are irrelevant under the scaling that makes the action of the model a fixed - point of the rg transformations , as we see in what follows .",
    "we consider then a model whose action at the classical level is @xmath25 where the indices @xmath26 run over the two patches around @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    the scaling transformation that leaves invariant the kinetic term of the action is @xmath27 it is easily checked that , with the transformation ( [ s1])-([s3 ] ) , the interaction term in the action ( [ act ] ) is also scale invariant for a constant value of the potential @xmath28 . if this is not constant , provided that it is a regular function of the arguments we can resort to an expansion in powers of the momenta .",
    "only the constant term is significant , since the rest of higher - order terms fade away upon scaling to the low - energy limit @xmath29 .",
    "this means that we meet the first requirement to apply the rg program , that is to have a model which converges to a fixed - point under rg transformations at the classical level .    in the above scaling",
    ", we already find the first deviation in the rg program with respect to the analysis of fermi liquid theory . in the case of a model with circular fermi line ,",
    "the interaction term is scale invariant only for very special kinematics of the scattering processes@xcite . in our model",
    ", we have seen that no constraint is needed on the four momenta involved in the interaction at the classical level .",
    "it is only after taking into account virtual processes that the interactions will start to grow large under scaling for some particular choices of the kinematics .",
    "this will single out a number of so - called marginally relevant channels among all the scattering processes , recovering then the similitude with the analysis of fermi liquid theory at the quantum level .",
    "the two - patch rg analysis of the @xmath7 hubbard model has proven to give the dominant instabilities of the system with the fermi level at the vhs . for @xmath30 , a ferromagnetic phase has been found below a certain critical frequency@xcite , in agreement with the results obtained from monte carlo calculations@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will be interested in the regime with @xmath31 , where the competition between a spin instability and a pairing instability arises , making the model more appropriate for the comparison with the phenomenology of the cuprates .",
    "in what follows we apply a wilsonian rg approach to obtain the low - energy effective theory of the system .",
    "we proceed by progressive integration of the modes in two thin shells of width @xmath32 at distance @xmath10 in energy below and above the fermi level , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ muren ] . for the time",
    "being , we will assume that the fermi level is located precisely at the vhs , unless otherwise stated .",
    "this is crucial to obtain a significant renormalization in any of the interaction channels , and later on we will comment on the naturalness of this situation .    the vertex functions may become relevant , that is increasingly large at low energies , only for very definite choices of the kinematics . focusing on the four - point interaction vertex ,",
    "this is renormalized by a quantity of order @xmath32 at each rg step only when the momentum transfer along a pair of external lines is either * 0 * or @xmath33 , or when the total momentum of the incoming modes vanishes ( bcs channel ) . in the present work we deal with the latter two instances , since the first corresponds to the case of forward - scattering interactions , which are subdominant in the range @xmath31 that we are considering . in this regime , the divergences at vanishing momentum - transfer are related to charge instabilities of the system , which have been treated in detail elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we will see that divergences in the channel with momentum transfer * q * give rise to a spin instability , which competes with the superconducting instability in the bcs channel in the model with a bare on - site repulsive interaction .    the different kinematics which may appear in the bcs channel are listed in fig .",
    "we allow for the possibility of umklapp processes in which the incoming modes scatter from one of the saddle points to the other .",

    "the other important distinction is between direct ( @xmath34 ) and exchange ( @xmath35 ) interactions .",
    "direct processes are those in which the momentum transfer * q * is taken by the same scattered fermion line , while in a exchange process the momentum transfer takes place between two different fermion lines connected only by the interaction .",

    "the condensate is made of particle - hole pairs with a nonvanishing average projection of the spin .",
    "the fact that a macroscopic number of these pairs has been formed is what forces the quasiparticles to live out of the range already excited by the condensate .",
    "an important issue concerns the spontaneous breakdown of the spin - rotational symmetry in the condensate .",
    "let us consider the model at zero temperature regarding this matter .",
    "it is clear that the nonvanishing average spin can not have in principle any preferred direction in space .",
    "recalling our definition in eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) , a real value of @xmath145 implies that the spin of the condensate points in the @xmath116 direction , since @xmath146 a purely imaginary value of @xmath145 implies otherwise that the spin of the condensate lies in the @xmath147 direction .",
    "finally , it may also be that the nonvanishing mean value is realized for the @xmath148 component of the spin @xmath149    in the ground state of the model at zero temperature , the spin of the condensate has to point in a definite direction and the su(2 ) rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken . as a consequence ,",
    "two goldstone bosons arise in the spectrum , which correspond to the spin waves that propagate on top of the particle - hole condensate .",
    "these are the gapless excitations of the model , together with the quasiparticle excitations that exist sufficiently far away from the saddle - points .",
    "we now turn to the instability that arises from the divergent flow of eqs .",
    "( [ iu1 ] ) and ( [ iu2 ] ) .",
    "the integral of these equations depends on the position of the chemical potential with respect to the vhs . for this reason ,",
    "it is crucial to know how @xmath150 depends on the cutoff @xmath10 as this is progressively lowered .",
    "the issue of the renormalization of the chemical potential has to be treated necessarily in the framework of the wilsonian rg approach . as the high - energy modes are integrated out at the scale @xmath10 , @xmath13 shifts its position by a quantity propotional to @xmath36 . at the same time , it is the chemical potential which sets the level to measure the energy cutoff , as shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ muren ] .",
    "the outcome is that @xmath13 adjusts itself at each step of the rg process , until the point in which the cutoff @xmath10 is lowered down to the final chemical potential .    at the computational level ,",
    "the shift of @xmath13 is given by the frequency and momentum - independent part of the electron self - energy , with intermediate states taken from the high - energy modes being integrated .",
    "the renormalization is proportional to the charge of the occupied states in the lower slice of width @xmath36 , which couples through the forward - scattering vertex @xmath151 in the usual hartree and exchange diagrams .",
    "the rg equation for the chemical potential reads @xmath152 the perturbative approach is further improved by incorporating the renormalization of the @xmath151 vertex , which bears a well - known dependence on the energy scale measured from the vhs@xcite @xmath153    when the density of states @xmath22 is a smooth function of the energy , the integration of high - energy modes produces a steady downward flow of @xmath13 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this effect corresponds to the upward displacement of the one - particle levels due to the repulsive electronic interaction . in the neighborhood of the vhs ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath13 becomes highly nonlinear given the singular behavior of the density of states in eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) .",
    "it turns out that , in a certain range of initial values , the chemical potential is renormalized down to the vhs and precisely pinned to it in the low - energy regime .",
    "as stated in the introduction , this result pertains to a statistical description in terms of the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the physical picture is appropriate then for an open system in contact with a charge reservoir , which sets the bare value @xmath154 of the chemical potential .    in order to evaluate the influence of the vhs on the renormalization of the chemical potential , we have solved eq .",

    "it is manifest that , for initial values of the chemical potential @xmath156 above the singularity , the final renormalized value of @xmath13 lies very close to the vhs .",
    "these results are important to assure that the enhancement of the instabilities due to the divergent density of states does not rely on fine - tuning the fermi level to the vhs , as the chemical potential tends to pin itself in a natural way to the singularity .",

    "the couplings read directly from the hamiltonian of the hubbard model correspond to the boundary between the regions of stable and unstable flow .",

    "there are actually perturbations that fade away when the theory is scaled to low energies , but that may be important because they may destabilize the flow in the bcs channel .    in the particular case of the hubbard model ,",
    "such irrelevant perturbations are given by the iteration of particle - hole diagrams of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ iuwave ] . apart from the particle - particle diagrams , these are the only corrections that arise from the bare couplings of the model , and they are not enhanced at low energies since the particle - hole bubbles do not have the appropriate kinematics to be of order @xmath162 in the wilsonian approach@xcite .    the iteration of the bubbles in fig .",

    "that is characterized by the energy at which the bcs couplings grow large or , more conveniently , by the point at which these couplings have a singularity .",
    "this depends on the initial position @xmath12 of the chemical potential , and it has been represented as a function of this variable in fig . [ filldiag ] .",
    "we find that the bcs couplings diverge only for values of @xmath154 in the range of attraction to the vhs , that is when the renormalized chemical potential is pinned to the singularity .",
    "there is an optimal value of @xmath154 for which the scale of the transition reaches a maximum , as the chemical potential stays closer to the vhs during a greater part of the rg flow . for lower values of @xmath154 , the scale of the instability decreases , as a consequence of the fact that the renormalized chemical potential is not precisely pinned then to the vhs .",
    "we have also represented in fig .",
    "[ filldiag ] the energy at which the spin instability opens up , according to the estimate of section v. we realize that this scale is always above the energy at which the singularity develops in the bcs channel , whenever the spin instability exists in the system .",

    "the renormalized chemical potential deviates from the vhs by an amount even larger than the gap that would be due to the spin instability , so that this does not find the conditions to develop .",
    "we have then a picture in which the pairing instability exists alone for @xmath154 below the optimal doping , but it is actually precluded above that level since the spin instability sets in before with the formation of a gap in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "we comment finally on the symmetry of the condensate wavefunction .",
    "the fact that the umklapp interaction @xmath166 becomes increasingly repulsive when approaching the instability implies that the wavefunction must have opposite signs in the saddle - points @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "as long as in the unstable flow we approach the asymptotic regime @xmath168 , the response function for the @xmath4-wave operator @xmath169 develops a singularity at the frequency where the coupling @xmath170 blows up . by the same token , it is easily seen that the response function for the @xmath171-wave operator does not display any divergence at low energies . without the need of knowing precisely the shape of the gap , we may assure then that the symmetry of the order parameter is of @xmath4-wave type , with nodal lines at the bisectors of the four quadrants .",

    "we have paid attention to the spin degrees of freedom when considering the different interactions , what has allowed us to discern the universality classes of the system .",
    "we have seen that , regarding the spin correlations , there is a universality class characterized by a spin instability in the low - energy theory , in opposition to the regime of couplings with smooth behavior of the correlators for the spin operators . in the case of the extended hubbard model with on - site",
    "interaction @xmath1 and nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath3 , the spin instability arises for @xmath87 , irrespective of the value of @xmath3 , and it is absent for @xmath174 .",
    "several authors have previously considered the competition between the spin and the superconducting instabilites in the universality class corresponding to the divergent flow in the upper half - plane of fig .",
    "[ flowdd]@xcite .",
    "our analysis has shed light into a number of features of the spin instability .",

    "the fact that a macroscopic number of these pairs has been formed is what forces the quasiparticles to live out of the range @xmath145 excited by the condensate in the neighborhood of the saddle - points .",
    "the fermi line is destroyed in a region whose size is bounded by @xmath144 , in units of the inverse lattice spacing .",
    "this effect provides a paradigm for the disappearance of the fermi surface of an electron system which differs from the understanding of such a phenomenon in mott - hubbard insulators .",
    "those systems are supposed to be in a strong - coupling regime , in which the double occupancy of each lattice site is highly suppressed . in our case , we need otherwise to constrain the fermi level near the vhs , departing sensibly from half - filling as @xmath15 is increased .",
    "most remarkably , the instability takes place no matter how small the bare couplings may be in the above picture .",
    "this is what ultimately allows to discern the symmetry breaking in the ground state within our rg approach .",

    "the hubbard model with just on - site interaction is placed at first sight on the boundary between the regions with stable and unstable behavior .",
    "we have shown that the model has irrelevant perturbations that drive the system towards the side with divergent rg flow .",
    "since the departure from the limit behavior is weak , the superconducting instability is overshadowed by the spin instability , up to a point of optimal doping beyond which the latter is absent .",
    "the use of the wilsonian rg approach provides some advantages over other rg methods , the most important being the possibility of studying the renormalization of the chemical potential .",
    "given the divergent behavior of the density of states at the vhs , it is clear that all the positions of the fermi level can not be equally stable .",
    "the scaling of the chemical potential can be obtained by letting it free to evolve and computing the shift from the integration of high - energy modes near the cutoff at each rg step . following this procedure ,",
    "we have seen that there is a range of attraction near the vhs where the chemical potential is renormalized down to the singularity .",
    "this guarantees the naturalness of the different instabilities since , rather than relying on the fine - tuning of the fermi level , they arise from its precise pinning to the vhs in the low - energy effective theory .",
    "in this section we compute the imaginary part of some of the susceptibilities of the model .",
    "it turns out that the particle - hole susceptibility @xmath175 and the particle - particle susceptibility @xmath176 have a nontrivial imaginary part , while this vanishes for @xmath177 and @xmath178 at any finite frequency .    in our model , the susceptibility @xmath179 is given by @xmath180 where the energy cutoff is implicit in the integration over the momenta .",
    "according to the standard prescription , the imaginary part of ( [ susc ] ) is given by @xmath181 in the limit of small @xmath15 , eq .",

    "we obtain @xmath185    we see therefore that the imaginary part is equal to @xmath186 times the prefactor of @xmath187 in the real part of the susceptibility .",
    "it can be checked that the same relation holds between the real and the imaginary part of the particle - particle susceptibility @xmath176 .      a result similar to ( [ sferro ] )",
