    "thick branes have been proposed as a smooth generalization of the randall - sundrum scenario @xcite . in this model ,",
    "five - dimensional gravity is coupled to scalar fields .",
    "thick brane models consist in a more realistic scenario than the randal - sundrum one , since no singularities appear due to the form of the scalar potential functions .    as a matter of fact",
    ", thick brane models have been comprehensively used in the task of localization of physical fields on the brane .",
    "the importance of this subject stays in the fact that the introduction of extra dimensions affects both gravitational interactions and particle physics phenomenology , and leads to modifications in the standard cosmology .",
    "if the extra dimensions indeed exist , it will inevitably change our ideas about the universe .",
    "the quest of field localization can guide us to which kind of brane structure is more acceptable phenomenologically @xcite .    in this context",
    ", gravitons and fermions , as well as gauge fields can be localized on the brane in thick brane models .",
    "gauge fields , in particular , are localized only with the help of the dilaton field . the kalb - ramond field localization in this scenario",
    "was also studied by @xcite . there",
    "the use of the dilaton was again necessary in order to localize the kalb - ramond field on the brane .    on the other stand point",
    ", scenarios have been proposed where thick brane solutions are extended to spacetimes with dimension more than five @xcite . among these works , we have some where branes are embedded in a bulk with a string - like metric .",
    "the mainly motivation to study branes in the presence of a string - like bulk comes from the fact that most of the standard model fields are localized on a string - like defect .",
    "for example , spin-@xmath0 , spin-@xmath1 , spin-@xmath2 , spin-@xmath3 and spin-@xmath4 fields are all localized on a string - like structure . particularly , the bosonic fields are localized with exponentially decreasing warp factor , and the fermionic fields are localized on the defect with increasing warp factor @xcite .",
    "even more interesting is the fact that spin-@xmath1 vector @xcite , as well as the kalb - ramond field @xcite , which are not localized on a domain wall in randal - sundrum model , can be localized in the string - like defect .",
    "however , most of the thick brane models in six dimensional scenarios , proposed so far , have been suffering from some drawbacks .",
    "the first difficult is related with the introduction of scalar fields as a matter - energy source in the equations . in this case",
    "it is very difficult to find analytical solution to the scalar field and to the warp - factor as well .",
    "koley and kar @xcite have suggested a model where analytical solutions can be found in a six dimensional scenario , however they run into a second difficult .",
    "this difficult is related with the positivity of the components of the energy - momentum tensor and has been found by other authors also @xcite .",
    "finally , field localization are not possible for any field in the thick branes defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , at least for physically acceptable solutions .    on the other hand , in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "a model was proposed where a brane is made of a scalar field with bounce - type configurations and embedded in a bulk with a string - like metric .",
    "this model produces a sound ads scenario where none of the important physical quantities is infinite . among these quantities",
    "are the components of the energy momentum tensor , which have its positivity ensured by a suitable choice of the bounce configurations .",
    "another advantage of this model is that the warp factor can be obtained analytically from the equations of motion for the scalar field , obtaining as a result a thick brane configuration , in a six dimensional context .",
    "it has been shown that scalar field localization is suitable in the scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , paving the way in the sense of localization of other fields .",
    "therefore , in the present work we will study the possibility of localization of vector and fermion fields in these scenario , in order to test its applicability and robustness .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section2 ]",
    ", we address the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a bulk scalar field with bounce - type configurations generates a brane which is embedded in a bulk with a string - like metric . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we address the vector field localization , and in section [ section4 ] the fermion field localization is established . on the other hand , section [ section4b ] cope with qualitatively analysis of the fermionic massive modes .",
    "section [ section5 ] is devoted to remarks and conclusions .",
    "the use of bulk scalar fields to generate branes was introduced by goldberger and wise @xcite , and has been largely studied in the literature @xcite . in the six - dimensional context , koley and kar @xcite",
    "have built a scenario where the brane is made of scalar fields and analytical `` thin brane '' solutions have been found out .",
    "several progress have been obtained in the work by koley and kar in the intend of construct brane solutions in six dimensions , as well as , in the task of localize physical fields . however , some troubles with the energy conditions ( wec , sec , nec ) @xcite were found . in this model",
    ", the energy momentum tensor violates all the energy conditions since its components are not positive defined .",
    "recently , an ads type solution was found in a model which assumes a six dimensional action for a bulk scalar field in a double well @xmath5 potential minimally coupled to gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant @xcite . in this scenario , which will underly the present article ,",
    "it is admitted that the scalar field equation possess bounce - like statics solutions depending only on the radial extra dimension , where the simplest is @xmath6 .",
    "the model is described by the action @xmath7\\ ; , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the @xmath9-dimensional gravitational constant , and @xmath10 is the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "the fields live in a string - like scenario with the following metric @xmath11 where @xmath12 denote the @xmath9-dimensional space - time indices , @xmath13 the @xmath14-dimensional brane ones , and @xmath15 denote the @xmath2-extra spatial dimension ones . also @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    in the same way of the model introduced by koley and kar ,",
    "the one introduced in @xcite has the advantages to be analytical",
    ". however , the introduction of the bounce - type configurations to the scalar field that generates the brane supports a way to solve the problems with the energy conditions since the energy density may be positive or negative on the brane depending on the choice of the bounce configurations .",
    "moreover , the finiteness of the relation between the four ( @xmath19 ) and six ( @xmath20 ) dimensional reduced plank scale @xcite is ensured by the form of the warp factor found out by the authors which is given by @xmath21    in the expression above @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , the warp factor found out is equal to 1 at @xmath23 which ensures that on the brane one has a 4d minkowski space - time .",
    "besides , as @xmath24 goes to zero or infinity , the warp factor goes to @xmath0 .    in the reference @xcite",
    ", the authors also pointed the interesting possibility of localization of the standard model fields in this scenario . in this way",
    ", the scalar field localization has been implemented paving the way for the localization of other fields .",
    "an interesting result is that any non - gravitational trapping mechanism has not been necessary to localize scalar field in this model , which can been seen as an advantage when compared with results of dzhunushaliev and folomeev @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we will deal with vector and fermionic fields localization .",
    "it is know that it is possible to localize chiral fermions in the `` 5d version of this model '' @xcite .",
    "however , to localize vector field in this set up , in five dimensions , we need to have a dilaton field present in the model forming a  bounce - gravity - dilaton system \" @xcite .",
    "we expect , in this work , to localize fields in this scenario that is more realistic than the rs model ones , without the necessity of the dilaton field .",
    "[ vetor - local ]    in this section we will address the issue of the vector field localization . as we will see , it is possible to localize the vector field in this scenario if one has an exponentially decreasing warp factor , without the necessity of the dilaton field , as in the case of the the scalar field discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to deal with the vector field localization ,",
    "let us introduce the action @xmath25 where @xmath26 .    from the action above ,",
    "one obtains the equation of motion @xmath27 which results in @xmath28 this equation can be written in terms of equations for the vector field components as follows @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 as has been done in @xcite , if we choose the gauge condition @xmath32 and assume the decomposition @xmath33 and @xmath34 we can show that there exist the s - wave ( l = 0 ) constant solution @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that we assume that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 .    by substituting the constant solution in the initial action , the resultant integral in the variable @xmath24 is @xmath40 in order to have zero mode localization for the vector field in this model",
    ", we need that @xmath41 to be finite .",
    "it is clear that in the case for @xmath42 and with @xmath43 given by eq .",
    "the condition above is satisfied * ( as can be seen in figures ( [ fig.ia1 ] ) and ( [ fig.i1]))*. it is interesting to note that , in the domain wall case , this term is not present . that is why in 5d domain wall it is not possible to localize the vector field only by means of the gravitational interaction .    for further reference we may say that it is possible to obtain the zero mode localization for the vector field without imposing the gauge condition @xmath32 . indeed , if one consider a @xmath24 dependence of @xmath44 , say , @xmath45 , the system ( - ) will assume the form @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48    if the fields @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are decomposed as in eq .",
    "and eq . it is possible to obtain the constant solution @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the zero mode and s - wave .",
    "but in this case the function @xmath44 has to satisfy the equation @xmath51 whose general solution may be expressed as follows @xmath52 where @xmath53 are integration constants .",
    "obviously this equation admits a more simple solution as @xmath54 . for this specific case",
    "the results obtained for the vector field localization would be the same found above for @xmath32 .",
    "however , as will be seen this constant solution will be relevant for the localization of the fermion field in the next section .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here that other solutions for @xmath44 are possible , since they are finite for all @xmath24 _ and _ @xmath55 .",
    "however the simplest solution to achieve fermion confinement is @xmath56 .     +     +",
    "in this section , we will address the issue of fermionic field localization in a string - like defect scenario . at first , we will following the procedure of the reference @xcite , where fermionic fields are localized on a string - like defect .",
    "however , as will be shown , it is not possible to localize the fermionic field in this scenario if one requires an exponentially decreasing warp factor , which is possible in the case of scalar and vector fields as we have seen .    on another standpoint there",
    "exist an approach developed by liu and collaborators @xcite , where it is possible to localize the fermionic field in the case of a decreasing warp factor . in this approach ,",
    "one modifies the covariant derivative by adding a minimal coupling between the fields . on other hand , here we propose a mechanism in order to localize the fermion field using the minimal coupling in the bouncing brane keeping an decreasing warp factor in scenarios of codimension two brane .    to begin with ,",
    "let us proceed as in the reference @xcite .",
    "we have that the fermionic field action can be written in a scenario with six dimensions as @xmath57 and the equation of motion related with this action is @xmath58 where the matrices @xmath59 represent the dirac matrices in a curved spacetime .",
    "these matrices are related with the dirac matrices in the flat spacetime as @xmath60 where the _ vielbein _ @xmath61 is given by the relation @xmath62    the covariant derivative has the standard form @xmath63 where the spin connection @xmath64 is defined by @xmath65    in order to write explicitly the equation , we have to calculate the matrices @xmath59 as well as the covariant derivative . using the metric and the equation",
    ", we have that the relation between the dirac matrices in a curved space - time and the dirac matrices in the flat space - times is given by @xmath66    the nonvanishing components of the spin connection are @xmath67 moreover , one can explicitly write the covariant derivative components as @xmath68    in order to write the equations of motion to these fields , we have to set the way how the dirac matrices act on the _ spinor _ @xmath69 .",
    "this approach was presented by the references @xcite , which we follow closely .",
    "first , let us assume that the spinor can be written in two parts , the _ right _ part @xmath70 and the _ left _ part @xmath71 as @xmath72    the @xmath73 matrices act on these spinor as @xmath74 or yet in terms of the @xmath75 matrices in the flat spacetime , as @xmath76    naturally , for @xmath77 one has @xmath78    these equations can still be put in the form @xmath79",
    "@xmath80    we require here that @xmath81 must satisfies the dirac equation on the brane , namely @xmath82 .",
    "thus , taking into account the s - wave case , and the equations , , , , and , we will have that the equations of motion can be written as @xmath83    the general solution to the equation above is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant of integration .",
    "it is still necessary to verify if the solution is normalizable . in order to do this ,",
    "we need analyze the action with the spinor @xmath86 replaced by this solution and verify if the resultant integral in the variable @xmath24 is finite . from this ,",
    "the interesting integral for the case analyzed here assumes the following form @xmath87 at last , let us replace the expression for @xmath88 in the equation in a way that , for the case where @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 we note that no localization of the fermionic fields is possible in the case of a smooth warp factor given by @xmath91 .",
    "even the possibility of assume @xmath92 is not possible since @xmath93 . in consequence , in our case",
    "it is not possible to appeal to a growing warp factor .",
    "therefore , the only alternative that remains is to use the treatment introduced in the reference @xcite which consists in modify the covariant derivative by adding a term of minimal coupling .",
    "if one does this , the new covariant derivative reads @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a gauge field , @xmath96 the electrical charge , and @xmath97 is the imaginary unit .",
    "such modification does not change the relation between the gamma matrices , neither the nonvanishing components of the spin connection . on the other hand , the covariant derivatives components in this case ,",
    "will be changed to the following forms @xmath98 \\psi ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\\\",

    "it is sufficient that @xmath106 .",
    "the integral ( ) is naturally convergent for @xmath107 , so we have to study it in the other limit , @xmath108 .",
    "it is easy to see that in this limit the function @xmath109 is linear on @xmath24 and , in this case , it is possible to write @xmath110 . in this situation",
    "we can easily see that ( ) converges .",
    "indeed , it will assumes the simple form @xmath111    now , setting @xmath112 and since the exponential function always assumes values greater than values from a linear function , one sees that the integral above is convergent ( as can be seen in figures ( [ fig.ia12 ] ) and ( [ fig.i12 ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , for left handed fermions we must set @xmath113 in order to converge that integral .     +     +",
    "in this section we treat the fermionic massive modes using a qualitative analysis . in order to do this , we put the equations of motion of the massive spinor in the form of the schrdinger equation .",
    "first , we consider the massive counterpart of the eq .. indeed , with help of eq .",

    "we present a sketch of the potentials in fig.([fig.vbounce ] ) .",
    "we note from the fig.([fig.vbounce ] ) that both potentials are gap free when @xmath122 .",
