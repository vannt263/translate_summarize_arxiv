    "the depth of the flux ratio trough near the 3.6  micron channel in the atmospheric models with stratospheric absorber strongly depends on the redistribution parameter p@xmath50 ( @xcite , especially their fig .  4 ) .",
    "further modeling would allow tighter constraints on the p@xmath50 , not just for , but for a variety of planets .",
    "the fortuitous importance of the 3.6  micron irac channel to the study of planetary atmospheres is likely to be enhanced as the _",
    "spitzer space telescope",
    "_  runs out of cryo - coolant in 2009 , when only the 3.6  micron and 4.5  micron channels will be available .",
    "we report the estimated flux ratios of the planet   in the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0-@xmath9 channels .",
    "we find that the estimated fluxes are not consistent with a canonical cloudless model for thermal emission from the planet and instead may indicate an atmosphere with as yet unknown stratospheric absorber and a likely thermal inversion , which would cause the water band longward of 4.0 microns to switch from absorption to emission .",
    "the atmospheric model with a thermal inversion produces a tight match to the data at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0 microns , but is inconsistent by 2.7@xmath12 with observations at 5.8 microns .",
    "this is similar to observations of hd 209458b @xcite .",
    "the presence or absence of the stratospheric absorber and thermal inversion layer has been linked to the flux from the parent star at the sub - stellar point on the planet . the   sub - stellar point flux of @xmath10.49 @xmath2 10@xmath3 erg cm @xmath4 s @xmath5 is the lowest so far reported for a planetary atmosphere with a thermal inversion . observations of atmospheres of other planets may permit a better understanding of the thermal inversion layer and parametrization of the characteristics that create such a thermal inversion .",
