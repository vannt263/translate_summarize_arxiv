    "the apparent symmetry between the quark and lepton generations is a mysterious occurrence within the standard model ( sm ) and has inspired many theories which go beyond the sm to relate them at a more fundamental level . as a result",
    "many of these models naturally contain leptoquarks , or particles that couple to a lepton - quark pair .",
    "theories which fall in this category include , composite models with quark and lepton substructure@xcite , the strong coupling version of the sm@xcite , horizontal symmetry theories@xcite , extended technicolor@xcite , and grand unified theories ( guts ) based on the gauge groups @xmath8@xcite , @xmath12 with pati - salam @xmath13 color symmetry@xcite , @xmath14@xcite , and superstring - inspired @xmath3 models@xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the leptoquarks carry both baryon and lepton number and are color triplets under su(3)@xmath15 . in models where baryon and lepton number are separately conserved , which includes most of the above cases",
    ", leptoquarks can be light ( of order the electroweak scale ) and still avoid conflicts with rapid proton decay .",
    "their remaining properties , such as spin , weak iso - spin , electric charge , chirality of their fermionic couplings , and fermion number , depend on the structure of each specific model .",
    "if leptoquarks were to exist we would clearly need to determine these properties in order to ascertain their origin .",
    "an excess of events at large values of @xmath16 have recently been reported@xcite by both the h1 and zeus collaborations at hera in their neutral current deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data .",
    "zeus has collected @xmath17 of integrated luminosity in @xmath1 collisions and observes 5 events with @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the usual dis scattering variables , while expecting 2 events from the sm in this region .",
    "h1 reports 7 events in the kinematic region @xmath23 and @xmath24 , compared to a sm prediction of @xmath25 with @xmath26 of integrated luminosity . clearly , the statistical sample is too small at present to draw any conclusions and it is likely that this excess is merely the result of a statistical fluctuation .",
    "another possibility is that this discrepancy is the result of deviations from current parton distribution parameterizations at large @xmath21 .",
    "this case , however , has been examined by the h1 and zeus collaborations@xcite and is found to be unlikely .",
    "also , such large modifications in the parton densities would most likely result in disagreement with the dijet data samples at the tevatron@xcite .",
    "it is also possible that this hera data might signal the first hint of physics beyond the sm .",
    "such an excess in event rate at large @xmath16 is a classic signature for compositeness if the events show no specific kinematic structure .",
    "this scenario has recently been analyzed@xcite in light of the hera data , with the result that an @xmath27 contact interaction with a right - left helicity structure ( in order to avoid the constraints arising from atomic parity violation data discussed below ) and a scale of @xmath28 is consistent with the data . however , if instead , the events cluster in @xmath21 while being isotropic in @xmath22 , they would signal the production of a new particle .",
    "while the reconstructed values of the mass ( @xmath29 ) of such a hypothetical particle show some spread between the two experiments , they are consistent within the evaluated errors , yielding a central value in the approximate range @xmath30 .",
    "if this excess of events turns out to be the resonant production of a new particle , we will need to examine the possible classes of new lepton - hadron interactions which could give rise to such a signature . at present , there are three leading scenarios of this type : ( i ) models with leptogluons , ( ii ) explicit r - parity violating interactions in supersymmetric theories , and ( iii ) leptoquarks .",
    "we now briefly discuss the first two cases , with the remainder of the paper being devoted to the third .",
    "color octet partners of ordinary leptons are expected to exist in composite models with colored preons@xcite .",
    "these particles , denoted as leptogluons , are fermions , carry lepton number and couple directly to a lepton - gluon pair with an undetermined strength .",
    "this effective interaction may be written as @xmath31g^a_{\\mu\\nu }",

    "we note that this effective lagrangian is non - renormalizable .",
    "if the chiral symmetry in these models is broken by qcd effects , the leptogluons are expected@xcite to have masses or order @xmath37 , and hence could be as light as a few hundred gev for compositeness scales in the tev range .",
    "leptogluons in this mass range would clearly reveal themselves in high-@xmath16 dis at hera .",
    "a @xmath38 leptogluon would also be copiously produced at hadron colliders .",
    "in fact , as we will see below , present tevatron data most likely excludes leptogluons in this mass region .",
    "the second scenario for resonant new particle production listed above is that of supersymmetric theories with explicit r - parity violating interactions .",
    "the most general gauge and supersymmetry invariant superpotential ( with minimal field content ) contains the terms @xmath39 where the first two terms violate lepton number ( @xmath34 ) , the third violates baryon ( @xmath40 ) number , the @xmath41 s are _ a priori _ unknown yukawa coupling constants , and the @xmath42 are generational indices where @xmath35 invariance demands that @xmath43 . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) a discrete symmetry matter parity ( or r - parity ) is applied to prohibit all these dimension four @xmath40 and @xmath34 violating operators .",
    "however , it is sufficient to ensure only that the @xmath40 and @xmath34 violating terms do not exist simultaneously in order to preserve nucleon stability .",
    "in fact , a discrete anomaly free @xmath44 symmetry , denoted as baryon parity , naturally allows for the @xmath34 violating operators , while forbidding the @xmath45 operators@xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of these models is strikingly different than in the mssm , as elementary couplings involving an odd number of supersymmetric particles now exist .",
    "this results in the possible single production of super - partners and an unstable lightest supersymmetric particle . at hera ,",
    "the second @xmath34 violating term in eq .",
    "[ rparsp ] can mediate single squark production .",
    "this possibility was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and later examined in detail in ref .",
    "the relevant terms in the interaction lagrangian for this case are @xmath46 + h.c.\\ ] ] the requirement of @xmath35 invariance combined with the fact that the positrons must be scattered off of valence quarks in order to account for the event excess at hera , leaves us with only one possible scenario , the production of charm or stop squarks via the first term above .",
    "this case has been recently examined@xcite in light of the data and will not be considered further here . however , we note that such singly produced squarks must also decay via their r - parity conserving interactions ( , @xmath47 ) at competitive rates , and hence events with these signatures must also be observed .",
    "we will comment on some of the difficulties associated with gut theories with r - parity violation below .",
    "we now examine the third candidate scenario above , the existence of @xmath48 gev leptoquarks , in detail .",
    "the interactions of leptoquarks can be described by an effective low - energy lagrangian .",
    "the most general renormalizable @xmath49 invariant leptoquark - fermion interactions can be classified by their fermion number , @xmath50 , and take the form@xcite @xmath51 with @xmath52 assuming the fermionic content of the sm . if the sm fermion content is augmented it is possible that new lq interactions may arise . here ,",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the @xmath35 quark and lepton doublets , respectively , while @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the corresponding singlets .",
    "the indices of the leptoquark fields indicate the dimension of their @xmath35 representation .",
    "the subscripts of the coupling constants label the lepton s chirality . for simplicity , the color and generational indices",
    "have been suppressed .",
    "since , in general , these couplings can be intergenerational , there is the possibility of large , tree - level flavor changing neutral currents and flavor universality violations . as discussed in the next section ,",
    "this can be avoided by employing the constraint that a leptoquark couple only to a single generation .",
    "we see that the leptoquark fermionic couplings are baryon and lepton number conserving , hence avoiding the conventional problems associated with rapid proton decay .",
    "note that the leptoquarks with fermion number ( @xmath57 ) of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) couple to @xmath61 , while the @xmath62 leptoquarks ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) have @xmath65 couplings . once this effective lagrangian is specified , the gauge couplings of the leptoquarks are completely determined .",
    "thus , only the strength of the leptoquark s fermionic yukawa couplings remain unknown . for calculational purposes ,",
    "these couplings are generally scaled to the electromagnetic coupling , @xmath66 where @xmath36 generically represent the @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we note that in extended technicolor theories , the leptoquarks ( denoted there as @xmath69 ) have couplings which are proportional to the masses of the quark - lepton pair . in this case",
    "the @xmath70 coupling is clearly too small to be of interest to us here .",
    "the quantum numbers and structure of the quark - lepton couplings are summarized in table 1 for each leptoquark species . for the couplings we list the helicity , relative strength , and fermion pairs with which a particular leptoquark may couple , using the convention @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the leptoquark s branching fraction into charged leptons , @xmath73 , is also given .",
    "the weak isospin structure is denoted by the brackets . due to gauge invariance",
    "we would expect all the leptoquarks within a given @xmath35 representation to be degenerate apart from loop corrections . for future reference",
    "we have also listed the @xmath8 representations of lowest dimension within which the leptoquark can be embedded .",
    "note that we have assumed the conventional assignments of the sm fermions to be in the @xmath74 and * 10 * representations .",
    "generally , only a subset of these possible leptoquark states are contained within a particular model .",
    "for example , the scalar @xmath75 is the leptoquark present in superstring - inspired @xmath3 theories .",

    "as mentioned above , low - energy data places strong restrictions on the leptoquark yukawa couplings . in this section",
    "we summarize the most relevant of these constraints .    as is well known , for a leptoquark to be sufficiently light for it to be of phenomenological interest at existing or planned colliders , it must have essentially chiral couplings to fermions . here , we give two examples which demonstrate this conclusion .",
    "( @xmath123 ) consider a first generation leptoquark coupling to @xmath124 with strength @xmath125 , and to @xmath126 with strength @xmath127 . a fiertz transformation then yields the interaction @xmath128 which gives a large contribution to the decay @xmath129 .",
    "comparison with current data results@xcite in the bound @xmath130 tev , implying that at least one if not both of these yukawa couplings must be small , if leptoquarks are to be light .",
    "if one of these couplings is sufficiently large in order to induce leptoquark - fermion interactions at an interesting level , then the coupling with the other handedness must essentially vanish , , the couplings are chiral .",
    "( @xmath131 ) one can also examine the leptoquark s contribution to the @xmath132 of the muon arising from a one loop penguin diagram involving a light quark and a leptoquark . in this case",
    "if couplings of both helicities are present , current data places the constraint@xcite @xmath133 tev , and again we see that these couplings must be essentially chiral .",
    "even if the leptoquark - fermion couplings are chiral , strong constraints on their magnitude still arise from their potential contributions to a wide class of flavor changing neutral currents and related phenomena .",
    "an exhaustive study of this class of transitions has been performed by davidson , bailey and campbell@xcite , and hence we will not repeat this type of investigation here . the results of this study show that most of the stronger bounds can be satisfied if the requirement that a given leptoquark couple to only one generation is imposed .",
    "this results in the nomenclature of first , second and third generation leptoquarks found in the literature .",
    "note that this restriction is more severe than the simple requirement of family number conservation at a single vertex .",
    "this is easily illustrated by examining the process @xmath134 , which would receive a large tree - level contribution if leptoquarks were allowed to simultaneously couple to both the first and second families .",
    "after the constraints of chiral and single generation couplings are imposed , there are two important remaining low - energy constraints arising from atomic parity violation ( apv ) and the universality testing decay @xmath135 .",
    "comparable but somewhat weaker bounds also follow from quark - lepton universality .",
    "these additional restrictions have been examined by leurer@xcite and also by davidson @xcite for both cases of scalar and vector leptoquarks .",
    "we summarize these results in table 2 ( assuming that the lq is not responsible for the small difference between the sm expectations for the apv ` weak charge ' and what is obtained experimentally ) .",
    "these values have now been updated to include the recent results of wood on apv in cesium@xcite which are in good agreement with sm predictions@xcite yielding @xmath136 .",
    "note that these bounds are far from trivial .",
    "for example , we see from this table that a spin-0 , @xmath104 leptoquark with a mass of 200 gev must have @xmath137 ! as we will see below this is not far from the value suggested by the excess of events at hera .",
    ".combined limits on the ratio @xmath138 in gev , where @xmath139 is the leptoquark mass , for the leptoquarks multiplets from data on atomic parity violation and the decay @xmath135 . [ cols=\"<,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "at this point one may wonder how scalar leptoquarks of the @xmath62 type would fit into a larger picture .",
    "as we saw earlier , both @xmath140 can be embedded into a * 45 * , @xmath141 representation of @xmath8 while @xmath104 , which has less exotic electric charges , can be placed in a * 10 * or * 15*. in a susy extension , where one normally adds complete multiplets to automatically insure coupling constant unification , we would thus need to add either a * 10*@xmath142 ( * 15*@xmath143 ) or a * 45*@xmath144 at low energies . here",
    "the barred representation is introduced to avoid anomalies and to guarantee that the fermionic components are vector - like with respect to the sm gauge group . as is well - known",
    ", the addition of extra matter representations delays unification and brings the gut scale much closer to the string scale .",
    "a short analysis shows that adding complete * 15*@xmath143 s or * 45*@xmath144 s would lead to a dramatic loss of asymptotic freedom(af ) at one loop ( , @xmath145 ) and , in the later case , both @xmath140 would be present in the low energy spectrum .",
    "we would then need to explain why only one of the chiral couplings was present as well as the generational structure of the couplings by the imposition of some extra symmetries .",
    "the addition of the * 10*@xmath142 to the usual mssm particle content does not lead to either the loss of af at one loop or to the problem of suppressing one of the chiral couplings .",
    "interestingly , these general considerations tell us that the _ only _ leptoquarks consistent with both susy and unification within standard @xmath8 are @xmath104 and @xmath75 , the later being the familiar leptoquarks of @xmath3 string - inspired models@xcite . in both cases",
    "the qcd beta - function is found to vanish at one loop ( in the @xmath3 case three * 5*@xmath146 s are present with a different leptoquark for each generation ) .",
    "since we can safely add only a single * 10*@xmath142 at low energies , a realistic model would still need to explain the hierarchy of generation dependent coupling strengths .",
    "we note that in the light * 10 * together with the leptoquark will be a @xmath147 isosinglet bilepton@xcite and a @xmath148 , color triplet , isosinglet diquark .",
    "although the leptoquarks in the * 10*@xmath142 are found to be consistent with both unification and af considerations , we still can not identify them with the source of the hera events due to the nature of their @xmath8 coupling structure . to form a @xmath8 singlet in the product @xmath149 , only the antisymmetric terms in the @xmath150",
    "can contribute .",
    "this would imply that the leptoquark must couple in an antisymmetric fashion with respect to the generations@xcite so that the phenomenologically required @xmath151-type coupling would be prohibited .",
    "thus the requirements of af , susy @xmath8 unification , and the addition of complete multiplets do not simultaneously allow any @xmath62 leptoquarks with couplings to only a single generation .",
    "how do we circumvent this result ?",
    "one possibility is to surrender the assumption of the addition of complete @xmath8 representations at low energies .",
    "this certainly allows us more flexibility at the price of naturalness but still requires us to chose subsets of @xmath152 representations from the * 10 * , * 15 * or * 45 * which maintain af and unification . except for the rather bizarre choice of adding a @xmath153 from * 15 * and a @xmath154 from a * 10 * at low energy ,",
    "a short analysis shows that no other solutions were found to exist . here",
    "the notation refers to the @xmath155 quantum numbers of the representation .",
    "thus apart from this exotic choice we find that our constraints are sufficiently strong as to disallow any @xmath62 leptoquarks at low energy in the susy @xmath8 context .",
    "it is clear that we must give up conventional @xmath8 if we want a hera - inspired leptoquark in a susy - gut framework@xcite .",
    "perhaps the most attractive scenario for this is the flipped @xmath9 model@xcite wherein the sm fermion content is extended by the addition of the right - handed neutrino , @xmath156 , and the conventional roles of @xmath157 and @xmath158 are interchanged with those of @xmath159 and @xmath156 .",
    "thus , @xmath157 lies in the @xmath74 , the @xmath159 lies in the * 10 * and @xmath158 is in an @xmath8 singlet . in this case , completely different , and successful from the hera point of view , leptoquark embeddings are now possible . for example , @xmath101 can be placed in a * 10*@xmath142 without the difficulties associated with the cross generational couplings we encountered above since @xmath158 is an @xmath8 singlet .",
    "in this case we would still need to impose some additional symmetries so that @xmath101 could only couple to the first generation .",
    "note that this * 10*@xmath142 would also contain the @xmath85 leptoquark as well as an isosinglet bilepton with @xmath160 .",
    "the @xmath85 may also show up as a separate resonance in @xmath2 collisions as discussed above if it has yukawa couplings of order @xmath161 once sufficient luminosity is accumulated .",
    "@xmath95 can lie in a * 10*@xmath142 , but would require cross generational coupling as above since both @xmath34 and @xmath157 are in the @xmath74 . on the otherhand , @xmath104 now lies in a * 45*@xmath144 and is excluded by the af constraints .",
    "it thus appears that the flipped @xmath9 scenario provides a natural embedding for at least one of these @xmath62 leptoquarks , @xmath101 , and may predict the simultaneous existence of an @xmath162 leptoquark .",
    "other gut groups may provide phenomenologically successful embeddings for the other @xmath62 leptoquarks .",
    "the extension of the spectrum to include the @xmath156 field may introduce some new additional interesting phenomenological implications for these leptoquarks since their interactions now extend beyond those described by the lagrangian in section 2 and may possibly yield excess events in the charged current channel .",
    "if lq s really exist in a susy framework then their fermionic partners , leptoquarkinos(lq - inos ) must also be observed@xcite .",
    "what are the masses of such states ?",
    "if the lq - ino is lighter than the lq then the partner will decay directly to the lq plus the lsp , since the lq yukawa is so small , unless the two states are nearly degenerate .",
    "this implies that the lq - ino is the more massive of the two states , thereby decaying into the lq plus lsp .",
    "since the fermion pair cross section is larger than the scalar pair cross section at the tevatron when both are color triplet states , it is clear that the mass of the lq - ino must be substantially heavier than 200 gev in order to reduce the anticipated number of @xmath163 events to an acceptable level .",
    "what can we say about these leptoquarks in the non - susy context ?",
    "here we can only be more speculative .",
    "as is well - known , unification attempts without susy using only the sm particle content are doomed to failure in that they predict a too small value of the unification scale , implying a rapidly decaying proton , and lead to values of @xmath164 which are smaller than the experimentally determined value by many standard deviations .",
    "one is led to consider the general question of whether one could add ad hoc sets of additional ( non - susy ) particles with masses at the electroweak scale to those which already exist within the sm to get unification at a higher scale and a proper value of @xmath164 by sufficiently modifying the sm beta functions .",
    "a short consideration shows that this is difficult to arrange . at one - loop",
    ", the modified beta functions must satisfy the so - called `` b - test''@xcite : @xmath165 where @xmath166 clearly satisfies the test . in earlier work@xcite",
    ", many additional particles with a wide range of strong and electroweak quantum numbers were added in many thousands of combinations in order to attempt to satisfy these constraints with only two dozen candidates surviving ( see table 1 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "given the higher precision of current data , at least several of these survivors could now be eliminated leaving a very short list .",
    "a survey of this list shows that there is only one case with scalars which have the correct quantum numbers to be consistent with leptoquarks of _ any _ kind .",
    "interestingly , this case corresponds to a pair of @xmath104 leptoquarks with the higgs sector of the sm augmented by an additional doublet .",
    "this scenario was first discovered in the analysis of murayama and yanagida@xcite and is quite unique with @xmath167 .",
    "figure  [ guts ] shows a two - loop renormalization group(rge ) analysis of this particular case .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath168 and @xmath169 we obtain @xmath170 and a proton lifetime@xcite of @xmath171 yrs , which is close to the present limit in the @xmath172 mode@xcite .    as a final comment we note the oft - neglected problem of r - parity violation within a gut context .",
    "a term in the superpotential of the form @xmath173 would generate all of the usual lepton and baryon number violating r - parity violating terms _ simultaneously _ with comparable yukawa couplings and would lead to a very rapid proton decay .",
    "it may be possible , however , to forbid such an r - parity violating term at the renormalizable level while having them arise as higher dimensional operators@xcite .",
    "it is not clear , however , that an interaction of the type @xmath174 can be generated in this approach with a yukawa coupling of the right magnitude to explain the hera events@xcite .",
    "in this paper we have considered the detailed phenomenological implications of interpreting the excess of events observed by both h1 and zeus at hera as the production of an @xmath175-channel scalar leptoquark resonance .",
    "first , we demonstrated that the d0 leptoquark search data strongly indicate that this resonance could be neither a leptogluon nor a vector leptoquark with a mass near 200 gev due to their much larger pair production cross sections at the tevatron .",
    "secondly , we showed that the hera data itself , in particular the apparent lack of a signature in the @xmath2 channel even with the low accumulated luminosity , supports the idea that the leptoquark is of the @xmath62 type .",
    "we also showed that future hera measurements in all @xmath176 channels will allow a determination of the leptoquark s quantum numbers if sufficient luminosity and polarized beams become available .",
    "thirdly , we analyzed the sensitivity of the drell - yan process at the tevatron , dijet production at lep ii as well as precision electroweak measurements to the existence of leptoquarks . in all cases we found little sensitivity to leptoquarks with masses near 200 gev with values of @xmath177 near 0.1 .",
    "fourthly , we found that the single leptoquark production process at the tevatron main injector may provide an independent determination of its yukawa coupling , provided that sufficient integrated luminosity is obtainable , while pair production at the nlc allows one to directly determine all the leptoquark quantum numbers .",
    "lastly , we saw that leptoquarks can be embedded into a gut structure both with and , surprisingly , without susy .",
    "successful susy unification combined with the requirements of asymptotic freedom forced us to look beyond standard @xmath8 to the flipped @xmath9 model where @xmath101 can be embedded . without susy , a model with 2 higgs doublets and a pair of @xmath104 leptoquarks",
    "was found to unify near @xmath178 gev and led to reasonable values for both @xmath164 and proton lifetime .",
