    "clusters of galaxies are the most massive gravitationally bound and collapsed objects in the universe and are important systems for studies of the formation and evolution of large - scale structure ( lss ) in the universe .",
    "their large mean spatial separations ( @xmath0mpc ) make them excellent tracers for lss .",
    "the cosmological subfield of lss is still in its infancy , with new and exciting discoveries occurring often . as large ,",
    "all - sky surveys continue to catalog the heavens , galaxy clusters will remain the most efficient tool for mapping lss . the importance of a complete map of lss has become evident in some recent discoveries of how the internal properties of clusters can be affected by surrounding large - scale structure ( novikov et al .",
    "1999 ; loken et al . 1999 ; miller et al . 1999 ) .",
    "additionally , clusters are often thought to be a `` fair sample '' of the mass in the universe , and therefore useful for estimating the relative fractions of baryonic and `` dark '' matter ( white _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; white and fabian 1995 ; however see qin and wu 2000 ) .",
    "most of the largest cluster surveys presently available in the astronomical literature have been constructed at optical wavelengths using galaxy population overdensities to define the individual clusters .",
    "the best known example of this technique is the abell ( 1958 ) and abell , corwin , and olowin ( 1989- hereafter aco ) optical cluster catalogs .",
    "many researchers have discovered observational selection biases within these catalogs as a direct result of the criteria used in their creation ( see _ e.g. _ sutherland 1988 ; efstathiou 1992 ) .",
    "one of the more deserved critiques of the abell / aco catalogs is the inaccuracy of the the richness classifications ( lumsden et al .",
    "1992 ; van haarlem _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; white , jones and forman 1999 ) .",
    "richness has long been used as a classification in nearly all optically selected cluster catalogs  _",
    "i.e. _ abell , apm , edcc , pdcs etc  yet it is rather unphysical to quantify cluster properties ( such as mass , size , etc ) based on a simple two  dimensional galaxy count within an arbitrary radius , to an arbitrary magnitude - limit with a local and/or global field galaxy count subtracted off .",
    "this ignores a significant amount of information contained in the individual galaxies ( such as intrinsic brightness and color ) .",
    "also , the richness of a cluster can be severely contaminated by projection effects as one goes to higher redshift .",
    "in addition to these problems with galaxy richness , the recent discovery of `` fossil groups '' and `` dark clusters '' further illustrate the deficiencies of richness . both vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and romer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have discovered several examples of `` fossil groups '' which are the proposed relics of group formation and evolution _",
    "i.e. _ all the galaxies in the group have ` cooled ' and fully merged into one large galaxy in the center of the potential well . however , the x  ray emitting gas is still ` hot ' and appears extended .",
    "therefore , in an optical survey these systems appear to be one galaxy while in the x ",
    "rays they appear like groups of galaxies .",
    "clearly there is a dark ",
    "matter halo associated with such systems which would be completely missed in a classical , richness  limited survey .",
    "however , in an optical luminosity  based cluster survey , these systems would be included since the one central galaxy is typical many @xmath1 in brightness ( see romer et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we propose here dropping the notion of cluster richness in favor of total optical luminosity of a cluster ; this can either be in a single passband or as a function of color _",
    "e.g. _ constraining the color of the light to that appropriate for elliptical galaxies .",
    "thus we allow the individual galaxy properties to re - enter the analysis .",
    "currently , a large portion of the sky has reasonably accurate galaxy magnitudes through the apm / cosmos galaxy catalog .",
    "this database covers the southern galactic cap .",
    "there is a significant amount of work being done in the northern hemisphere ( _ e.g. _ the dposs survey ( djorgovski _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ) .",
    "soon , we will have precise magnitude , and color information for most bright ( @xmath2 ) galaxies throughout the entire sky .",
    "we show in this work that future cluster identifications would be better quantified by total optical cluster luminosity than by richness .      the edinburgh - durham cluster catalog ( lumsden et al .",
    "1992 -hereafter edcc ) was objectively selected from the edinburgh / durham southern galaxy catalogue ( edsgc ; collins , nichol & lumsden 1992 , 2000 ) which was built from machine - scans of 60 uk schmidt photographic survey plates . in total",
    ", the edcc contains over 700 galaxy overdensities covering over @xmath3 of the sky centered on the south galactic pole .",
    "the reader is referred to lumsden _",
    "( 1992 ) for details about the edcc .",
    "we supplemented the optically  selected edcc catalog with x  ray information taken from the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) bright source catalog ( voges _ et al .",
    "this was achieved through cross ",
    "correlation of the edcc centroids with the rass  bsc positions . in figure 1",
    ", we show our separation analysis for our edcc ",
    "bsc sample which demonstrates a positive correlation ( above that expected from random ) for separations of less than 4 arcmins .",
    "below 4 arcminutes , we would only expect a random 5.3 matching pairs while we see 53 matching pairs .",
    "therefore , we use 4 arcminutes as our matching radius which should ensure that 90% of our these 53 edcc clusters have a true x  ray companion .",
    "we then cut the edcc ",
    "bsc sample to include clusters with a known redshift ( collins et al .",
    "1995 ) as well as those edcc clusters coincident with an extended bsc source , thus guaranteeing minimal contamination from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "these restrictions leave us with a subset of 20 edcc ",
    "bsc clusters from the original 53 matches .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of the edcc ",
    "bsc clusters were computed as follows .",
    "first , the observed bsc count rate ( counts per second ) was converted to a flux ( ergs per second per @xmath4 ) by integrating a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum of @xmath5kev and metallicity of 0.3 solar over the rosat pspc response function ( @xmath6kev ) and comparing this to the observed count rate ( we corrected for absorption by the galactic neutral hydrogen using the data of stark et al .",
    "second , we corrected this aperture flux into a total cluster flux using a standard king profile ( @xmath7kpc and @xmath8 ) . finally , our fluxes were converted into x - ray luminosities using @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ( although we note that the choice of @xmath11 makes little difference in our calculations ) .",
    "the optical luminosities for these 20 edcc clusters were calculated using photometry from the edsgc which was calibrated to an accuracy of @xmath12 across the whole survey ( see collins et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we first calculated the absolute magnitudes for all galaxies with @xmath2 within each cluster using the same methods as lumsden _",
    "we use @xmath13 as the @xmath14-correction suitable for the @xmath15 passband ( ellis 1983 ) , and @xmath16 as the extinction values taken from the schlegel , finkbeiner , and davis ( 1998 ) reddening maps . assuming that each galaxy lies at the distance of the cluster",
    ", we summed the individual galaxy luminosities to determine the local average background luminosity out to @xmath17mpc around the cluster center .",
    "we then subtracted the local background from total cluster luminosity as determined within @xmath18mpc of the cluster center .",
    "we applied apparent and absolute magnitude constraints and found only small ( @xmath19 ) variations in our results .",
    "we also calculated the background using the average luminosity within the ring from @xmath20mpc to @xmath17mpc , effectively excluding the optical emissions from the clusters .",
    "again , our final results only varied by @xmath19 . from these analyses , we conclude that our methods are robust and we measure errors on @xmath21 according to the variation in the choice of absolute magnitude limits ( from @xmath22 )",
    ". we present our optical and x - ray luminosities in table 1 .    in this work",
    ", we are studying a unique subset of the edcc data , _",
    "i.e. _ only those that have a redshift and extended x - ray emission in the rass  bsc .",
    "therefore , the sample presented in table 1 has a complicated selection function since we have made two flux cuts ( for the edcc & bcs ) , a cut on x  ray extent and a cut on richness ( since the high richness clusters have measured redshifts ; nichol et al .",
    "however , this selection function should not effect our analysis and results since we are simply using this sample to study the relationship of optical  to  x  ray luminosities of these systems and are presently uninterested in the cross  comparison of these qualities between clusters .",
    "the second sample we have used is the abell / aco subset presented by fritcsh & buchert ( 1999 , hereafter fb ) who used a sample of 78 abell / aco clusters to create a fundamental plane in @xmath23 , @xmath24 and half - light radius and @xmath25 .",
    "they determined their optical luminosities after subtracting a local galaxy / photon distribution and applying a schechter luminosity function with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the individual galaxy magnitudes were taken from the cosmos galaxy catalog .",
    "the x - ray luminosities were determined from rosat data using a raymond - smith code .",
    "more details can be found in fb .",
    "unfortunately , fb do not provide the uncertainties on their data .",
    "our third cluster sample is the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) bright sample which contains 130 clusters constructed from the eso key program .",
    "this has since become the reflex cluster survey ( guzzo et al . 1999 ; bohringer et al .",
    "the rass bright sample is an x - ray selected cluster catalog .",
    "extended x - ray sources in the rass data were searched for over - densities in the galaxy distribution .",
    "this survey is count - rate limited in the rosat hard x - ray band .",
    "the rass bright sample covers 2.5 steradian around the southern galactic cap .",
    "we find 20 rass clusters within a similar section of the sky as the edsgc .",
    "however , due to the significantly different cluster selection and x - ray identification techniques between the rass and edcc surveys , we find only five clusters that are common to both .",
    "in other words , although the edcc and rass samples are in the same portion of the sky , the two samples remain nearly statistically independent .",
    "the x - ray luminosities for the rass clusters are listed in de grandi et al .",
    "we measured optical luminosities for the rass clusters similarly to the edcc clusters ( see above ) and present them in table 1 .      finally , we use data provided by mahdavi _",
    "_ 1997 for poor galaxy groups .",
    "studied 36 groups with at least five galaxy members selected from the center for astrophysics redshift survey ( ramella _ et al .",
    "nine of these groups were found to have definite x - ray emissions via rass data .",
    "the optical properties were determined from zwicky magnitudes listed in ramella _",
    "et al . _ and mahdavi _ et al . _",
    "fit schechter luminosity functions ( with @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) to determine total optical luminosities to a limit of @xmath30 .",
    "we note that three groups in this sample are also @xmath31 abell clusters ( although none are in the fb data as well ) .",
    "in figure 2 , we plot @xmath32 versus @xmath33 for the abell / aco clusters ( fig 2a ) , edcc clusters ( fig 2b ) , galaxy groups ( fig 2c ) and rass clusters ( fig 2d ) .",
    "a correlation analysis indicates that the optical and x - ray luminosities are linearly related to 4.4@xmath34 , 3.1@xmath34 , 2.1@xmath34 , and 1.9@xmath34 significance levels respectively .",
    "[ note : if we remove the three `` outliers '' in the rass sample , the significance rises to 3.2@xmath34 .",
    "this suggests that these points may not be clusters , but extended agns ] . in all but the group sample",
    ", we also provide a robust best - fit line through the data points .",
    "the fit for the galaxy group is given by mahdavi _",
    "( 1997 ) . in all cases , the slopes ( listed in fig .",
    "2 ) are very close to unity , suggesting a simple proportionality survives the many procedural differences in the way these samples were selected and analyzed : _ i.e. _ schechter functions were fit to some clusters , while for others , a simple sum of the individual galaxy luminosities was performed .",
    "also , different optical wavelength windows were used _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath15 for abell / aco , edcc , rass , and @xmath35 for the galaxy groups .",
    "different aperture sizes within which magnitudes were summed were used : variable radius for abell / aco clusters , @xmath36mpc for edcc clusters and rass clusters , and @xmath37mpc for the galaxy groups .    at this point , it would be helpful to understand the role of the amplitude in figure 2 .",
    "however , we simply do not have enough information to constrain any more parameters than the slope .",
    "some of the effects on the amplitude are more easily quantified , such as the solar luminosity used in the @xmath38 normalization or the hubble constant used .",
    "the other procedural differences within these samples are more difficult to ascertain and correct for , such as the counting - radius used , magnitude - limits , etc .",
    "therefore , at this point we would like to stress the importance of the simple proportionality between optical and x - ray cluster luminosities .",
    "the simplest possible assumption about the assembled contents and their emitted radiation seems to produce the observed results . this need not have been true .",
    "optical luminosity measures the total optical radiation of all the stars in the clusters  which depends on the efficiency of star formation , the initial mass function of the stars formed , and the age of the populations .",
    "the x - ray emission depends on the mass , temperature , and the ( square of the ) density of the hot gas .",
    "we have studied a wide range of objects from galaxy groups up through rich clusters  several orders of magnitude in mass and luminosity . the trend which forms the basis of our result continues through this mass hierarchy .",
    "this result could be the endpoint of a cosmic conspiracy of canceling effects .",
    "however , a simpler explanation is that `` averaging '' is effective , even on small scales . if systems as small as galaxy groups sample the stellar and gaseous phases of baryonic matter in the universe as well as rich clusters , and the overall efficiency and mass range of star formation is about the same , and if the radiative efficiency of bremsstrahlung radiation is again about the same on average , then our result will follow .",
    "a slightly puzzling aspect of this result is that the larger systems are known to have higher velocity dispersions  and one would expect higher gas temperatures .",
    "one would think this would lead to greater x - ray luminosity per unit mass of gas .",
    "besides the cosmological implications , we must also consider how these results can be immediately applied in the construction of future cluster catalogs . with a proper normalization to the @xmath39 relation",
    ", we can very quickly and easily estimate cluster x - ray luminosities and masses using only the galaxy magnitudes and a minimal amount of spectroscopic and x - ray information .",
    "we need not perform extensive spectroscopic or x - ray observations of an entire cluster sample in order to analyze mass functions or correlation - functions and their dependence on cluster masses and x - ray luminosities .    as an example , we plot @xmath40 vs @xmath21 for the abell / aco clusters in figure 3 . here , we have used cluster virial masses ( @xmath41 ) as published in girardi _",
    "( 1998 ) and the richness counts from the aco catalog .",
    "the optical luminosities presented in fb were calculated within radii that included all of the light above the background .",
    "therefore , we use those masses corresponding to the largest radii as published in table 3 of girardi _ et al .",
    "_ figure 3 shows that optical luminosity linearly traces the total mass in galaxy clusters over a wide range , whereas we see a much weaker dependence of richness on mass .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 is much easier to correlate to mass than richness .",
    "( 1997 ) have used more distant clusters to show that @xmath42 varies little over a much smaller range of mass .",
    "we can not provide any quantitative limits on @xmath42 for clusters without more information on the fb optical luminosities .    in this paper",
    ", we have demonstrated that the total optical luminosity of clusters and groups of galaxies is correlated with both the x  ray luminosity and mass of these systems .",
    "this result is very important because , in the near future , there will be many new surveys of galaxies and clusters , _",
    "e.g. _ dposs , reflex , sdss , eis , 2mass _ etc .",
    "_ , and we will need objective methods to a ) compare these different catalogs and b ) relate the cluster properties to physically meaningful quantities .",
    "optical cluster luminosities will be easy to compute from these digital catalogs and will allow us to directly relate optical cluster catalogs with x  ray  selected catalogs ( _ e.g. _ reflex , emss , sharc ) .",
    "moreover , it is hoped that the optical luminosity of a cluster is more easily related to theoretical cluster research than the galaxy richness , since we have shown that the optical luminosity is simply probing the density in baryons in the cluster .",
    "it is appears that galaxy richness has a similar physical motivation .",
