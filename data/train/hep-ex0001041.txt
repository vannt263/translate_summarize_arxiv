    "extensive air showers ( eas ) resulting from primary cosmic - ray particles of energies above 1 eev ( @xmath0 ev ) produce an ionization trail which is comparable to that of micro - meteors , which have been detected for many decades using radar methods ( lovell 1948 ; greenhow , 1952 ; hanbury brown & lovell 1962 ) .",
    "in fact , blackett & lovell ( 1940 ) proposed that earlier detections of sporadic radio reflections at altitudes of 5 - 20 km from the troposphere and mesosphere ( cf .",
    "colwell & friend 1936 ; watson watt et al .",
    "1936a , 1936b , 1937 ; appleton & piddington 1938 ) might be attributed to cosmic ray eas , although at the time both the energies and fluxes of such events were only crudely known .",
    "later confirmation of the meteoric origin of higher altitude ionization trails may have contributed to a lack of follow - up on this prescient suggestion for the source of these low - altitude sporadics .",
    "the idea was re - examined in the early 1960 s ( suga 1962 ) and a proposed experiment was described by matano et al . ( 1968 ) ; however , no results from this test have appeared in the literature to date .",
    "eas ionization trails are now commonly detected by their air fluorescence emission at near - uv wavelengths ( cf .",
    "baltrusaitas et al .",
    "future large eas detector arrays such as the auger project ( gurard et al .",
    "1998 ) and the proposed space mission owl / airwatch ( scarsi et al . 1999 ; krizmanic et al .",
    "1999 ) have made fluorescence detection of eas a centerpiece of their approach , since it can provide information such as the position of the shower maximum and the total shower energy which can be difficult to pin down with particle detectors alone .",
    "one of the most compelling reasons to extend the sensitivity of eas detectors in this energy regime is the possibility that neutrinos of energy @xmath1 ev may be an important component of the primary particles ( capelle et al .",
    "1999 ) , contributing to the fluxes at these energies either directly or indirectly .",
    "neutrinos and other highly penetrating particles will induce air showers that develop much deeper in the atmosphere than hadron - initiated showers",
    ". a unique signature of their presence would be the detection of highly inclined ( near - horizontal ) showers for which the point of maximum development is many radiation lengths deeper than is possible for a hadronic or electromagnetic shower .",
    "thus any technique which ( like the air fluorescence approach ) has a particular sensitivity to showers of this type is of interest in addressing this problem .    to our knowledge",
    "no one has reported any studies the ionization trail of eas using radar echo techniques , although as we will show here , the signals should be clearly detectable using standard radar methods .",
    "one reason for this may be the transient nature of the expected echoes ; short duration transients are typically rejected by radar systems designed to detect or track targets where the reflectivity does not rapidly decay .",

    "meteor ionization trails are commonly parameterized in terms of their ionization line density @xmath2 ( electrons m@xmath3 ) , a measure of the total ionization content divided by the length of the meteor track .",
    "typical radar - detected meteors occur at heights of 80120 km , and have line densities of @xmath4 to @xmath5 m@xmath3 . at the lowest detectable line densities , the incident meteor has a mass of @xmath6 g , with a radius less than 100 @xmath7 m . at typical velocities of @xmath8 km s@xmath3 , the implied kinetic energy of these meteor grains is 0.05 joules or more , much of which goes into ionization of the air along it path .",
    "a cosmic ray proton of energy @xmath0 ev also has a kinetic energy of order 0.1 j , and much of this energy also ultimately ends up in the form of ionization and excitation of atoms of the air along the path of the shower of charged particles that results from the proton s collision with nuclear hadrons .",
    "the primary differences between the meteor track and cosmic - ray - induced eas are in the way the ionization column forms , and in the resulting ionization density profile .    for the meteor , ablation of material from its surface yields atoms with kinetic energies of @xmath9 ev , which ionize air molecules by direct collision with a mean free path of several cm .",
    "this produces an ionization column with an approximately uniform distribution of radial density , and an initial radius of 2 - 10 m. the density then evolves with time due to diffusion , convective processes , bulk motions of the air , and the lorentz forces of the ambient electric and geomagnetic fields . electron attachment and recombination",
    "eventually complete the process of dissipating the ionization column . at radar frequencies in the hf to lower vhf range ( 10 - 100 mhz ) , echoes from typical meteors may be detectable for several seconds after the meteor is gone .",
    "the ionization in an eas , in contrast , is not produced by a single body , but rather by the collective effects of the disk highly energetic particles ( mostly electrons and positrons ) that make up the body of the shower . because the lateral distribution of these particles spreads out as the shower progresses ,",
    "the ionization column is formed with a different initial distribution than that of a meteor , reflecting the evolution of the cross - sectional charged particle density .",
    "in addition , since the shower propagates essentially at the speed of light , it appears almost instantaneously compared to even the fastest meteors at @xmath10 km s@xmath3 .",
    "an important measure of the transverse charged particle distribution in an eas is the moliere radius @xmath11 within which of order 90% of the charged particles can be found . for air at sea level , @xmath12 m , but it is important to note that within @xmath11 the radial distribution is a power law , and most showers retain a tight core of particles of diameter several m or less which may look much like the column initially produced by a meteor .",
    "in fact , of order 10% of the total number of electrons in an eas are likely to be found within a radius of @xmath13 , comprising much less than 1% of the area of the moliere disk .    [ [ lightning - ionization - columns . ] ] lightning ionization columns .",

    "ionization charge densities produced by lightning are many orders of magnitude higher than those produced by either eas or small meteors , and the plasma channels produced by lightning are also of much smaller diameter than either meteor or eas ionization columns .",
    "however they do occasionally occur in clustered networks with transverse scales comparable to those of eas and meteors , and at altitudes that overlap the altitudes of eas maxima .",
    "thus they can provide examples of radar targets with features that are in some ways relevant to our discussion .    in the following section we present the concept of the radar cross section and outline specific cases relevant to eas ionization columns .",
    "section 3 develops a semi - analytical method for determining the ionization densities for a given air shower energy and altitude , and discusses some issues related to the evolution of the electron density .",
    "section 4 then makes estimates of the radar echo power based on the formalism developed in the previous two sections .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper with a discussion of some applications to specific experimental conditions .",
    "for radar detection of the columns that result from meteors , eas events , or lightning , there are two regimes to consider , depending on the plasma frequency @xmath14 of the ionized region : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electron density in @xmath17 .",
    "these two regimes are known in as the under- and over - dense regimes , respectively , and traditionally ( in the meteor radar literature ) are divided at the line density of @xmath18 m@xmath3 . however , because of the significant differences in the radial distribution of the electrons in eas ionization compared to that of meteors , we distinguish them only on the basis of the ratio of radar frequency to plasma frequency , a distinction that is also common to radar lightning measurements .",
    "thus we will consider the over - dense portion of an ionization column to be that region where the electron density is high enough that the plasma frequency exceeds the radar frequency , and the radar can not penetrate it and is reflected .",
    "underdense columns are those which have electron densities such that the local plasma frequency is below the frequency of the incoming radar , which can therefore penetrate the ionized region .",
    "radar targets are most commonly described in terms of their effective radar cross section ( rcs ) , a measure of the equivalent physical area of an ideal scattering surface . here",
    "we will develop concepts useful to understanding the rcs characteristic to ionization columns , to prepare for later estimation of the expected radar return power from eas - induced ionization .    in the following subsections we introduce general formulas for the rcs for both over- and under - dense cases .",
    "an additional distinction is also useful in each case : the long wavelength , or _",
    "regime involves targets with characteristic dimensions smaller than the radar wavelength used ; and the short wavelength , or _",
    "regime involves cases where the characteristic target size is much larger than the radar wavelength .",
    "when the electron density @xmath19 is high enough to produce a surface where the plasma frequency exceeds the frequency of the incident radiation at some critical radius @xmath20 from the track , the resulting index of refraction becomes imaginary , and total external reflection of the radiation occurs . under these conditions the surface at @xmath20",
    "can be treated to first order as a metal cylinder , and the rcs is accordingly greatly enhanced .      when @xmath21 , the cylindrical region of reflecting plasma can be approximated as a thin wire . as we will show later",
    "when we develop an estimate of the ionization density for eas , this is the case that will be most relevant to low - frequency radar echoes from eas . in this case",
    "the maximum of the rcs , which occurs for normal incidence , can be approximated as ( crispin & maffett 1965 ) : @xmath22 \\right ) ^2 } \\ ] ] where @xmath23 the angle of linear polarization with respect to the axis of the wire .",
    "the behavior of @xmath24 at angles other than normal incidence is given by : @xmath25 \\right ) ^2 \\right ] } \\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the angle as measured from the axis of the wire ( or eas in our case ) .",
    "this approximation is valid in the range @xmath27 , but underestimates the cross section at angles closer to the axis of the wire , due to what are known as _ traveling wave _ effects , which produce large cross sections near the axis , in some cases comparable to that at normal incidence ( medgyeshi - mitschang & putnam 1985 ) , and significantly broader in angular range .",
    "however , the treatment of such effects is very complex and beyond our scope at present .      when @xmath28 , the reflection from the critical surface becomes almost entirely specular , and for normal incidence we have ( kraus 1988 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the maximum value of the rcs , and @xmath31 is the length of the cylindrical reflecting surface .",
    "radar cross sections for metal cylinders have been studied in detail ( cf .",
    "medgyeshi - mitschang & putnam 1985 ) and are complicated functions of angle , with resonances and nulls that depend strongly on the length and other factors . as we shall establish below , eas ionization columns will generally not fall into the optical regime for the overdense case , except at very high eas energies and very low radar frequencies .",
    "for this reason we do not treat these effects further here .      for radar frequencies well above the plasma frequency @xmath14 , the radiation penetrates the entire ionization column , and the electrons within the ionization column scatter independently according to the thomson cross section @xmath32 the total effective radar backscatter cross section @xmath24 will then depend on the individual phase factors of each of the scattering electrons .",
    "for @xmath33 , and angles that are nearly perpendicular to the track , all of the electrons scatter coherently over a longitudinal region of the track @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the perpendicular distance to the track and @xmath36 the radar wavelength ( hanbury - brown & lovell 1962 ) .",
    "this region of the track is known as the first fresnel zone of the track , and the total radar backscatter cross section then becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of electrons within a single fresnel zone along the track .",
    "the radar cross section depends of the square of the electron density because of the assumption of full coherence .    except for radar frequencies",
    "@xmath39 mhz , most radar ranging of eas ionization columns is not in the rayleigh regime .",
    "however , the concept of the fresnel zone , which establishes a characteristic length scale over the longitudinal extent of the track , will still be useful in what follows .      for tracks where the radar frequency @xmath40 , but @xmath41 , the assumption of coherent scattering is no longer satisfied , and the individual phase factors of the electrons must be included . for this case the effective rcs can be written ( cf .",
    "wehner 1987 ; also see appendix ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the wave vector of the incident field ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 is the vector distance to the volume element at which the scattering takes place .",
    "here we are neglecting refractive effects of the ionization column on the incident radiation , and assuming that the incident and backscattered waves satisfy @xmath46 .    note",
    "that the argument of the exponential here includes an extra factor of two to represent the two - way phase .",
    "this is due to the fact that as the scattered radiation returns on the same path as the incident radiation , it picks up an additional phase factor equal to that of the incoming radiation .",
    "the term @xmath47 represents the differential contribution to the scattered electric field of a volume element of electrons which scatter coherently .",
    "if we now write @xmath48 then equation [ phasor - eq ] becomes @xmath49    equation [ fft - eq ] thus reduces the problem of estimating the effective cross section in the underdense case to that of calculating the fourier transform ( and the resulting power spectrum ) of the electron number density distribution . in the appendix",
    "we describe the geometry more explicitly and show how this relation arises .",
    "a broader implication of this result can be stated as follows : _ a measurement of the complex amplitude of the radar echo from an eas in the underdense case is proportional to a measurement of one fourier component of the shower ionization profile .",
    "_ this will be true even in the case of a bistatic radar ( receiver location not coincident with transmitter ) although there will be an additional coefficient to account for the bistatic cross section and its angular behavior .",
    "in the previous section we introduced the mechanisms for radar reflection from cylindrical plasma columns in two regimes of ionization density . here we estimate the spatial distribution of the expected ionization from a high energy cosmic - ray air shower , which will then allow us to assess their effective radar cross section .",
    "there are many years of development of the theory of eas production .",
    "the most accurate treatments of the evolution of the electron density in the shower require numerical simulations , but there are a number of parameterizations available that yield results accurate enough for our needs . here",
    "we use the analytical model due originally to kamata & nishimura ( 1958 ) , and greisen ( 1965 ) , often referred to as the nkg approximation . in the nkg model the longitudinal ( along - track ) development of the shower at a depth @xmath50 is parameterized by its _ age _",
    "@xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 mev for electrons in air , and @xmath54 gm @xmath55 is the electron radiation length in air .",
    "the evolution of the total number of charged particles ( virtually all electrons and positrons ) with depth is then approximated by @xmath56 \\over   \\sqrt{\\ln ( e / e_{crit } ) }   } ~.\\ ] ] although this approach does not account for any of the large fluctuations that are possible in high energy air showers , it describes the average behavior reasonably well .",
    "the transverse charged particle densities are described in a similar fashion , also parameterized by the age of the shower and the moliere radius @xmath11 ( bourdeau 1980 ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the gamma function , and @xmath60 .",
    "the moliere radius for air is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the density of the air at the altitude under consideration , and @xmath63 is the sea level density .",
    "the calculated density @xmath64 is in units of charged particles per unit area , passing through a plane transverse to the shower axis at the given depth .",
    "since the shower thickness is typically of order several meters or less over its length , @xmath64 can be approximately equated with the number density in a slab transverse to the shower .    to convert these particle number densities to the resulting ionization density",
    ", we use the average value for electron energy loss given by @xmath65 mev gm@xmath3 @xmath55 , divided by the mean energy per ion - pair for air @xmath66 ev ( segre 1977 ) which accounts for the inefficiency of ion - pair production .",
    "this procedure is similar to that used by the fly s eye ( baltrusaitas et al .",
    "1985 ) in estimating shower parameters based on fluorescence yield .",
    "we note here that the nkg approach and subsequent modifications to it do not accurately account for the electron distribution at large radii from the core , and will in general underestimate the electron density beyond the moliere radius .",
    "however , since the ionization density at large radii is low compared to the core , there is very little coherent contribution from these electrons , in spite of their large integrated number .",
    "our results remain basically unchanged by this effect .",
    "[ ne - fig ] shows curves of calculated ionization line densities for several eas of different primary energies over the range of @xmath67 ev .",
    "the showers are assumed to be propagating horizontally at an altitude of @xmath68 km , and the shower parameters are corrected for the lower air density at this altitude .",
    "the bottom axis shows the along - track distance corresponding to the depth shown along the top axis . as noted above",
    ", the line densities at these energies correspond to typical line densities of radio meteors , which are detected at heights of 80 - 120 km",
    ". however , the lateral distributions will be quite different as noted above .",
    "we note also that the showers are physically very long , with the region of shower maximum extending over many km of physical distance for most showers at these energies .    in fig .",
    "[ cumne - fig ] we show the effective line density as a function of the radius within which the electron density is integrated , for the inner 40 m radius for the same set of showers shown in fig . 1 .",
    "here it is evident that the effective line densities of the inner @xmath69 m radius core of the showers are about a factor of 10 lower than those which include all the electrons produced in the shower .",
    "however , this area corresponds to only 0.25% of the area of the moliere disk ( @xmath70 m at 10 km ) , it is thus evident that the cores of the showers are highly concentrated in ionization density with respect to the bulk of the shower disk area .    in fig .",
    "[ rhoe - fig ] , we show the lateral ionization density distributions near shower maximum for the same four eas presented in fig .",
    "[ ne - fig ] ( solid lines ) .",
    "included also are curves of the effective plasma frequency corresponding to the density at each radial distance ( dashed lines ) .",
    "given the uncertainty in the accuracy of the analytical model for eas development at very small core radii ( cf .",
    "@xmath71 cm ) , the implied highest radar frequencies that will undergo total reflection are in the range of 10 - 50 mhz , with a strong dependence on the primary energy .",
    "it is evident from figures [ cumne - fig ] and [ rhoe - fig ] that the cores of the showers are likely to be most important in determining the radar response , since the electron density is much higher near the core . in fig .",
    "[ rhoevsalt - fig ] , we plot the core electron density again near shower maximum for a @xmath72 ev horizontal shower , at a variety of different altitudes to display the effects of the different atmospheric density . to first order the shape of the core is preserved with altitude , but the overall electron density decreases at higher altitudes because the production rate of ionization depends on the density of the air .      before estimating the radar echo power , we first address the important topic of the expected lifetime of the free electrons in the ionization column .",
    "if eas detection by radar is to be proven practical , it is first necessary to first establish that the ionization column can be treated as quasi - static over the timescale it might take to interrogate the shower with a radar pulse , either as a standalone system , or if a separate air shower detector provided the trigger .    as an example of the issue with respect to triggered operation , consider a large air shower array with radius 30 km .",
    "for typical electronics used in such systems the trigger forms within several tens of @xmath7s .",
    "round trip transit time to an eas within @xmath73 km requires another @xmath74s .",
    "thus in this case we require eas electrons to remain mostly free for of order 250 @xmath7s or longer , if an external trigger is to be used to allow interrogation of a detected shower .",
    "in general , if the free electron lifetime is @xmath75 , and the trigger formation and pulse initiation time is @xmath76 , then the maximum range for a triggered system is @xmath77    if a radar detection system is operated in a standalone mode , the free electron lifetime will determine how often the detection volume must be pulsed in order to have a reasonable efficiency at detecting the eas . in the limit where the free electron lifetime becomes so short that it is comparable to the pulse duration ,",
    "then pulsed radar detection will become impractical .",
    "other methods which use continuous - wave ( cw ) techniques may still apply in this case ; these will be discussed briefly in a later section .",
    "there are a number of effects that cause the electron density to evolve with time :    1 .",
    "diffusion of the electrons through the ambient air , lowering their density and thus their net radar cross section ; 2 .",
    "electronic recombination with ions ; 3 .",
    "attachment of electrons to neutral molecules , or dissociative attachment to atoms ; 4 .",
    "collisional detachment of previously attached electrons , which frees electrons that have been attached to atoms ;      although the conditions of the atmosphere at the 80 - 120 km heights that meteor echoes are observed at are quite different from those at eas heights , it is useful to preface our analysis with a discussion of the effects that determine the time scale for meteor echoes .",
    "the duration of meteor radar echoes has been modelled and studied experimentally in detail for many decades ( cf .",
    "hanbury brown & lovell 1957 ; kaiser 1968 ; kaiser et al .",
    "1969 ; jones & jones 1990 ; jones 1991 ) .",
    "the power of a meteor radar echo is found in the underdense regime to decay exponentially with a time constant @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the ambipolar ( or ion neutral ) diffusion coefficient . at the altitudes that meteors",
    "are observed with radar , @xmath80 m@xmath81 s@xmath3 , and the typical decay times for underdense trails are thus several tens of ms for frequencies in the vhf regime .",
    "to estimate diffusion effects at the lower altitudes of eas ionization columns , we note that @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the kinetic temperature and @xmath84 the collision frequency ( cf .",
    "buonsanto et al .",
    "thus at 10 km altitude , the diffusion coefficient is much smaller , @xmath85 cm@xmath81 s@xmath3 , due mainly to the much higher collision frequency at lower altitudes . the implied time constant , assuming diffusion progresses in the same manner for eas as for meteor ionization columns , is @xmath87 s for @xmath88 m.    s - band radar echoes from lightning at altitudes of @xmath69 km measured by williams et al .",
    "( 1984 ) were frequently found to persist for several hundred milliseconds . for a wavelength of 11 cm ,",
    "the diffusion time constant at this altitude is 240 ms , which suggests that diffusion may be the dominant effect in the evolution of lightning radar cross section , at least at microwave frequencies .",
    "however , lightning ionization densities are estimated to be initially @xmath89 @xmath17 , with plasma frequencies @xmath90 or more times higher than for eas columns .",
    "thus other effects relevant to the conditions of this much denser plasma may be important .",
    "since diffusion is less effective at dissipating the ionization column of an eas than it is for a meteor , at least at vhf frequencies , we expect that attachment and recombination may play a more significant role .",
    "the recombination rate for atmospheric electrons is described by ( cf .",
    "thomas 1971 ) : @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the initial and evolving electron density , respectively , @xmath93 is the electron - ion recombination coefficient ( in units of @xmath94 s@xmath3 ) , @xmath95 and is the electron attachment rate ( s@xmath3 ) .",
    "here we have ignored terms in thomas ( 1971 ) which relate to the presence of negative ions in the ionosphere since we are considering eas within the troposphere where such ions are not prevalent .",
    "the electronic recombination coefficient for hydrogenic atoms can be approximated by ( seaton 1959 ) @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the electron kinetic temperature , with @xmath100 k typical for ionization in this case .",
    "for air in the troposphere we thus expect @xmath101 to @xmath102 @xmath94 s@xmath3 , and the implied recombination time for the highest electron densities we have considered is several minutes or more .",
    "thus it is highly probable that the electrons will attach before recombining .",
    "@xmath94 s@xmath3 are found in the d region of the ionosphere ( thomas 1971 ) .",
    "such a high value is likely to be due to the large variety of ion species present , which increases the total recombination cross section per electron . ]",
    "molecular oxygen is electronegative , forming ions with free electrons primarily through dissociative attachment , via the process @xmath103 where the resulting oxygen ion and atom carry off the excess kinetic energy of the electron , and the electron affinity of o@xmath104 is of order 0.5 ev .",
    "molecular nitrogen , in contrast , does not form attachments with electrons but can be more easily collisionally excited , and may play a role in mediating detachment processes in air .",
    "several studies of electron attachment in air using electron swarm techniques ( see gallagher et al .",
    "1983 for a compilation ) have indicated a much lower attachment rate than that which is expected from using the attachment coefficient for pure molecular oxygen reduced by the molar ratio in air ( moruzzi & price 1974 & references therein ) .",
    "measurements of the attachment coefficient are very sensitive to contamination by carbon dioxide , and co@xmath104 was not removed from the samples in many early measurements . although co@xmath104 can be present in significant concentrations in the near sea level atmosphere , its average concentration in the atmosphere as a whole is @xmath105% .",
    "thus electron attachment rates for dry , high - altitude air must be determined with co@xmath104 largely removed from typical air samples .",
    "moruzzi & price ( 1974 ) , after carefully removing all co@xmath104 from their samples , confirmed earlier measurements in being unable to detect any attachment in pure dry air .",
    "this result was attributed to a competing process : rapid collisional detachment from n@xmath104 interactions , yielding an effective attachment rate that was less than 10% of the ionization rate and thus too small too measure .",
    "their limit on the effective attachment coefficient @xmath106 for pure air is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the number density of the attaching molecular species .",
    "the attachment rate @xmath95 is related to the effective attachment coefficient through @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the electron drift velocity . for a typical electron drift velocity of @xmath111 cm@xmath3 s@xmath3 , the limit on @xmath113 gives @xmath114 s@xmath3 , implying that attachment dominates completely over recombination .",
    "figure [ attach - fig ] shows the behavior of the electron density for three different altitudes for a @xmath115 ev shower core region .",
    "here we have plotted the electron density time evolution for both the case where the attachment rate is equal to the limit of moruzzi & price ( 1974 ) , and one - tenth of the limit ( dashed lines ) .",
    "it is evident that the expected electron lifetimes are at least 10 - 20 @xmath7s , increasing slowly at the higher altitudes .",
    "[ attach - fig ]    although this estimate of the electron attachment lifetime is important from the point - of - view of evaluating whether there is sufficient time for triggered - interrogation of an eas with radar , it is also important to establish an upper limit on the electron lifetime , both for purposes of evaluating the possibility of multiple - pulse interrogation of a shower , and for considerations of radar clutter from echoes of multiple showers for a radar system with very large range .",
    "the lightning radar measurements noted above ( williams et al .",
    "1984 & references therein ) often found radar echo persistence of several hundred ms using repetitive radar pulses .",
    "however , the plasmas produced by lightning are extremely overdense and hot relative to those we are considering , and thermal detachment may play a significant role . in addition , the large amount of water vapor present in typical lightning radar measurements complicates any comparison with eas in dry air .",
    "thus comparison of radar echoes from lightning with those from eas ionization must be done with caution .",
    "an rough upper limit for the free electron lifetime can be obtained by considering the equilibrium level of free electron content of the mesosphere in the region of maximum cosmic ray ionization , peaking at about 12 - 14 km altitude .",
    "here the dominant ionization is caused by low energy ( several hundred gev and above ) cosmic ray air showers , which produce of order 30 ion pairs per @xmath94 per second ( rossi 1966 ; gregory & clay 1982 ) , roughly 15 times the sea level rate of ion production .",

    "to estimate the rcs for the underdense regime of an eas ionization column , we need to evaluate the individual contributions of the scattering electrons and the phase of the resulting scattered fields .",
    "as noted in section 2 above , under certain conditions this is equivalent to determining the fourier transform of the electron distribution .",
    "here we describe the basis for this conclusion and provide details of the methods used for numerical evaluation of the rcs under these circumstances .      the geometry for this evaluation is shown in fig .",
    "[ geom - fig ] .",
    "here we let @xmath224 represent the vector distance from the origin @xmath225 ( at the radar transmitter / receiver ) to the position of shower maximum .",
    "we choose the @xmath226 plane to be coincident with the plane containing the axis of the shower and @xmath224 . within the ionization column itself ,",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath227 to calculate the proper ionization density at position @xmath228 with respect to the position of shower maximum ; @xmath229 is the vector separation of @xmath228 from shower maximum .",
    "the vector joining the origin to @xmath228 is denoted as @xmath45 .",
    "the angle between the shower axis and @xmath224 is denoted @xmath26 .",
    "given these definitions , we find @xmath230 which expresses the distance to an arbitrary point in the ionization column as a function of the distance to shower maximum , the local cylindrical coordinates of the point , and the angle of obliquity @xmath26 of the shower",
    ".      the electric field that is incident at @xmath228 can be written as @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the magnitude of the transmitted field , @xmath233 is the transmitter gain factor ( as defined in the main text ) , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is defined in fig .",
    "[ geom - fig ] . assuming that @xmath43 and @xmath45 are parallel ( that is , neglecting the effective dielectric behavior of the underdense plasma in the column ) ,",
    "the received field from a small volume of electrons @xmath234 which scatter coherently is then given by @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the effective gain of the electron scattering process ( @xmath237 for isotropic scattering ) , corresponding to electric dipole emission . however , this response is complicated in any real plasma by a number of effects , and we have assumed @xmath237 for all cases considered here . ] and @xmath238 are the wavevector and radial vector of the scattered wave .",
    "in this case we have @xmath239 and @xmath240 , and thus @xmath241 which displays the expected radial dependence of the field ( equivalent to a @xmath242 dependence in received power ) , and also the additional factor of two in the spatial phase which is due to the two - way trip of the radiation .",
    "if we assume for the moment that the time variation of the field is steady  state , we can drop the time dependence , and integrate over the volume of the shower to yield the total received field strength , assuming that the transmitted beam is larger than the dimensions of the shower .",
    "if we also assume that the distance from the shower is large enough that @xmath243 , then we have @xmath244 which shows ( taking @xmath48 ) that the received field is proportional to the fourier transform of the electron density distribution .      under conditions where the pulse is incident on the ionization column at normal incidence , and",
    "if we assume that the ionization column is essentially constant along its longitudinal length , the received field becomes proportional to the two  dimensional fourier transform of the cross  sectional electron density , times the length of the fresnel zone @xmath155 ( defined as the length over which the scattered fields are in phase ) : @xmath245 we have numerically evaluated this using fast fourier transform techniques , since the area @xmath246 over which this is done is of order @xmath247 and the number of @xmath248 cells in the grid is @xmath249 , where we have assumed @xmath250 m , giving a @xmath251 grid .",
    "the result of the fft can be normalized to provide a frequency  dependent phase factor , which we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ phasefac - fig ] above .      in the previous analysis",
    "we have assumed a steady  state incident field ( which corresponds to carrier  wave or cw radar ) .",
    "however , in our analysis of section 4 , we assumed that the radar is pulsed , and in fact pulsed radar is preferable to achieve the kind of time resolution required in this application .",
    "for the overdense case , the analysis presented in section 4 is adequate , since we are considering reflections from a localized source at the critical radius of the ionization column .",
    "also , for normal incidence , the reflections from the first fresnel zone arrive closely in phase and can be treated without explicitly accounting for the pulse echo behavior .",
    "when we allow for oblique shower angles , however , the concept of the fresnel zone loses its usefulness , and the received echo comes from the entire volume of the shower and is thus significantly spread out in time .",
    "we require a method of treating the behavior of a discrete pulse under these conditions .",
    "the approach we have followed is intuitively simple : we first produce a time - projected profile of the electron density ; that is , we calculate the round - trip time associated with the global phase of each of the contributing differential volume elements of the scattering electrons @xmath252 here @xmath253 is the round - trip time for the @xmath254th volume element at location @xmath255 .",
    "if we consider all of the volume elements for which @xmath256 within a specified interval @xmath257 , then we define a shell at distance @xmath258 with a thickness of 1 radian of phase at the radar angular frequency @xmath259 .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ tprogeom - fig ] .    summing all of the contributing elements in this shell",
    "gives the time ",
    "projected square root of the total cross section at that phase : @xmath260    once @xmath261 is determined for a given radar wavelength , shower angle and energy , and distance , then the pulse response of the ionization column is determined by convolving the electric field of the pulse profile with @xmath261 , and squaring the result . if the pulse is defined to have unit amplitude , then the resulting convolution can be expressed as an effective radar cross section for use in equation [ sn - eq ] .    for example ,",
    "if the pulse is assumed to be a @xmath262-function in time , the resulting convolution @xmath263 is @xmath264 and the received power is then proportional to @xmath265 . for other pulse profiles we numerically evaluate the convolution explicitly , and take the maximum of the resulting profile to be the effective radar cross section .    in fig .",
    "[ timepro - fig ] we show an example of the square of @xmath261 , giving the time ",
    "projected cross section calculated according to the manner described here . in each case",
    "the time bins correspond to a radian of angular phase according to the wavelength indicated , and the value for each bin is estimated according to equation [ y - eq ] .",
    "the profile in this case shows a characteristic rapid rise on its leading edge , reflecting the rise in cross  sectional ionization density of the nearest portion of the shower .",
    "the more slowly falling trailing edge is due to the contributions from portions of the shower further away .",
    "we note that @xmath261 defined in this way is analogous to a green s function for the time response of the system .",
    "it can be used in this manner to evaluate arbitrary radar pulse shapes , for a given eas energy and direction . for extremely broad - band radar systems",
    ", the effective rcs values will begin to approach those of @xmath261 . for more narrow - band radar pulses",
    ", the convolution of the field oscillations with @xmath261 will act to partially cancel and the effective rcs will decrease .",
    "the refractive index of a plasma is given by spitzer ( 1962 ) in the quasilongitudinal approximation by @xmath266^{1/2}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that the frequency of the radiation is well above the electron gyrofrequency in the earth s magnetic field ( @xmath267 khz ) .",
    "in this case the phase delay of the radiation after propagating a distance @xmath268 through the plasma is given as ( cf .",
    "sovers et al .",
    "1998 ) : @xmath269 where the variable @xmath270 here represents the column density of the electrons integrated along the ray path : @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the classical electron radius and @xmath273 is the speed of light . the negative phase delay , or phase advance given above is characteristic of propagation in a plasma .",
    "more appropriate for consideration here is the group delay , obtained by differentiating @xmath274 with respect to frequency @xmath275 which constitutes a net additive delay that increases at lower frequencies .",
    "numerically , this delay has the value @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the electron column density in e@xmath278 @xmath55    integrating the electron densities in the halo of a @xmath72 ev shower along a radial path from outside the shower down to a radius of 1 m and then back out again ( to approximate the radar ray path ) yields @xmath279 e@xmath278 @xmath55 , and the corresponding delay at 30 mhz is 0.6 ns , or about @xmath280 of rf phase . a group delay of this order will have a negligible effect on the received power compared to the geometric phase factors .",
    "at lower frequencies , such at 10 mhz , the group delay is an order of magnitude larger , but the induced rf phase lag is still only @xmath281 .",
    "thus it appears that the refractive effects of the radial plasma halo can be ignored to first order for the eas ionization columns considered here .",
    "similar analysis of ray - path deviation along chords in the outer halo ( due to the gradient in the plasma density ) shows that the refraction is not significant until the chords approach within several m of the eas core for the highest energy showers .",
    "thus although it is important to include such effects in any final calibration of parameters estimated by radar measurements , they do not appear to bear significantly on the detectability of the showers ."
