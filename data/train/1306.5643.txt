    "in the early 90ies erta and kardar  @xcite studied the dynamic roughening of directed lines , as for example dislocation , polymer , or vortex lines , and for that purpose used a model consisting of two coupled one - dimensional kpz equations .",
    "prominent further examples , employing the same type of langevin equations , are sedimenting colloidal suspensions  @xcite and crystals  @xcite , stochastic lattice gases  @xcite , and magnetohydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the langevin equation has the generic structure @xmath0 @xmath1 labels the fields , @xmath2 .",
    "the components , @xmath3 , have varying interpretations depending on the physical context and we refer to them simply as @xmath1 component of the height .",
    "@xmath4 is the imposed drift velocity of the @xmath1th component .",
    "@xmath5 is the coupling of the time change of height @xmath1 to the slope of the heights @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "obviously @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the diffusion matrix and @xmath10 is the noise strength matrix , where @xmath11 are independent , space - time white noises with covariance @xmath12 for @xmath13 the index @xmath14 is omitted and @xmath15 .",
    "then ( [ 1a ] ) is the original kpz equation  @xcite .",
    "note that the velocity @xmath16 can be removed by switching to a co - moving reference frame .",
    "but for @xmath17 this is no longer possible , in general .    in",
    "@xcite the following particular case was considered : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath9 , @xmath20 diagonal , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 . in further studies ,",
    "also three components , non - zero velocities , and further couplings are considered .",
    "of particular interest for us is the link to multi - component driven lattice gases .",
    "this context will be explained in fair detail below , but to mention already now , for lattice gases @xmath23 will be the @xmath1th normal mode and the velocities @xmath4 differ from each other , generically .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a most illuminating case study .",
    "much more recently  @xcite , it has been realized that the coupled kpz equations ( [ 1a ] ) cover also the dynamics of fluids in one dimension and of anharmonic chains on a mesoscopic scale .",
    "these systems have three conserved fields , number , momentum , and energy , hence @xmath24 .",
    "langevin equations of the form ( [ 1a ] ) govern the coupled dynamics consisting of two sound modes and the heat mode , labeled canonically by @xmath25 .",
    "one finds @xmath26 , @xmath27 with @xmath28 the speed of sound .",
    "in particular , @xmath29 always , which implies that the heat mode will scale differently from the sound modes , see  @xcite for details . for anharmonic chains one can add stochastic collisions either respecting all or only some of conservation laws  @xcite .",
    "such stochastic models on a mesoscopic scale are also described by eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) , see e.g.  @xcite .    of central interest",
    "are the steady state time correlations @xmath30 for ( [ 1a ] ) . depending on the physical application other correlations and/or initial conditions could be considered .",
    "one obvious example are deterministic initial conditions as the flat data @xmath31 . mostly in the context of one - dimensional fluids ,",
    "one studies ( [ 1a ] ) restricted to a finite interval , @xmath32 $ ] , with dynamically prescribed boundary fluxes at both ends .",
    "then the steady state profile and its fluxes would be the prime target .",
    "such applications are beyond the present scope and we concentrate on the steady state time correlations .",
    "the case of a single component is very well understood . for a detailed summary",
    "we refer to section  [ single ] . for @xmath17 , the pioneering works quoted above focus on the properties of the steady state for ( [ 1a ] ) and on the scaling exponents of the heights .",
    "now larger systems can be studied and finer details are resolved . in particular , molecular dynamics for anharmonic chains has been carried out by several groups with great intensity  @xcite .",
    "following the example of a single component , one would like to identify the universality classes , to predict and to numerically compute the universal scaling exponents and functions , and to express the nonuniversal coefficients in terms of @xmath4 , @xmath33 .",
    "this is a grand program and our contribution is only a very first step .",
    "we will discuss the relation between driven stochastic lattice gases and coupled kpz equations .",
    "as benchmark example we perform monte carlo simulations of the two - component ahr model  @xcite , for which @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the steady states have to be computed through the matrix product ansatz and are generically not of product form , thereby providing a more severe test of the theory .    in section  [ secthydro ] we first recall the case of a single conserved field and then introduce a @xmath36-component lattice gas on @xmath37 .",
    "its fluctuating hydrodynamics will be transformed into @xmath36 coupled kpz equations . in section  [ sectahr ]",
    "we explain the matrix product ansatz for the ahr model .",
    "in particular we obtain analytically @xmath4 and the matrices @xmath33 in their dependence on the densities of the two components .",
    "the respective monte carlo simulations are reported in section  [ sectmcsimulation ] .",
    "it turns out that for the ahr model the theoretically predicted scaling is established already on fairly short time scales .",
    "this is a rather surprising observation in view of the experience with anharmonic chains , for which slow convergence seems to be the rule . as obvious difference",
    ", the ahr model is governed by a stochastic dynamics , while anharmonic chains are deterministic following the hamiltonian equations of motion .",
    "since the mesoscopic nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics is identical in structure , one has to search for a deeper explanation , which will be discussed in section  [ sectcorrectionscaling ] .",
    "let us first recall the very well understood case of a single component , , since it will serve as a blueprint for the general case .",
    "in fact , we will concentrate on the simplest model , namely the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) which consists of particles hopping on the one - dimensional lattice @xmath37 . at each site",
    "there is at most one particle , the occupation variable of site @xmath38 being denoted by @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "particles hop independently to the right with rate 1 .",
    "jumps violating the exclusion rule are suppressed .",
    "the steady state of the tasep is characterized by an average density @xmath41 , @xmath42 . in the steady state",
    "the @xmath39 s are independent and @xmath43 . running the stochastic dynamics with this initial condition",
    "defines the space - time stationary process @xmath44 and our interest are the correlations of the conserved field , @xmath45 where @xmath46 refers to the average in the stationary process with density @xmath41 .",
    "there are two general identities which follow directly from the conservation law . defining the susceptibility @xmath47 @xmath48 for tasep ,",
    "it holds @xmath49 in addition , see @xcite e.g. , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the average current in the steady state , @xmath52 for tasep .",
    "thus @xmath53 has total weight @xmath54 and is centered at @xmath55 .",
    "it has been noted already some time ago , that the broadening of @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath57 , hence superdiffusive @xcite .",
    "this is special for one dimension . in higher dimensions one would find diffusive spreading  @xcite with @xmath58 as upper critical dimension . in fact",
    ", the tasep allows for an exact solution and in  @xcite it is proved that @xmath56 scales as @xmath59 for large @xmath60 . the non - universal coefficient is @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 is a universal scaling function , see figure  [ figfkpz ] .    ,",
    "tabulated in  @xcite , with the properties , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 for @xmath67.,height=151 ]    while ( [ 4 ] ) is proved for the tasep and a few other models , it should hold at much greater generality , where @xmath54 is still defined as in ( [ 2 ] ) and @xmath51 is the steady state current at density  @xmath41 .",
    "one argument supporting universality relies on the observation that on the mesoscopic scale , the fluctuations in the density are governed by a stochastic field theory .",
    "to derive it one starts from the macroscopic conservation law as @xmath68 with @xmath69 the macroscopic density profile .",
    "for the standard gaussian fluctuation theory one would expand at @xmath41 as @xmath70 to linear order in @xmath71 and add phenomenologically dissipation and noise as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is normalized space - time white noise .",
    "note that the invariant measure for ( [ 6 ] ) is spatial white noise with variance @xmath54 .",
    "if the steady state of the microscopic model has rapidly decaying correlations , this would precisely describe its statistical properties on a large spatial scale . in this sense",
    "the static properties of ( [ 6 ] ) are consistent with the microscopic model . on the other hand , ( [ 6 ] )",
    "predicts a gaussian peak traveling with velocity @xmath74 and of width @xmath75 , in contradiction to ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the crucial insight is that the superdiffusive spreading results from the second order expansion of the current in ( [ 6 ] ) , to say the correct , now nonlinear , fluctuating hydrodynamics reads @xmath76 usually called noisy burgers equation . despite adding the nonlinearity @xmath77 , spatial white noise of variance @xmath54 is still the stationary measure for ( [ 7 ] )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the covariance of the stationary mean zero process , @xmath78 , scales as stated in ( [ 4 ] ) . this can be checked through the replica method  @xcite .",
    "the validity of the scaling ( [ 4 ] ) , or related type of scaling behavior , has been confirmed in experiments  @xcite and in numerical simulations  @xcite .    integrating in @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and switching to the frame moving with velocity @xmath74 , eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) turns into @xmath81 which is the kpz equation , _",
    "i.e. _ eq .  ( [ 1a ] ) for @xmath13 .    from a mathematical perspective",
    ", the kpz equation ( [ 7a ] ) is fairly singular .",
    "this can be understood by considering the gaussian process obtained by setting @xmath82 .",
    "then , with probability one , the spatial dependence @xmath83 is hlder @xmath84 , certainly not differentiable .",
    "the nonlinearity requires to multiply pointwise the slope , which is not a well - defined operation . in a recent contribution",
    "@xcite hairer uses the theory of rough paths to give a meaning to the one - component kpz equation .",
    "the case of several components has still to be studied .",
    "a related issue is to derive the kpz equation from a stochastic particle model in a suitable limit .",
    "a generic method consists in the limit of weak drive .",
    "this is easily illustrated for the pasep ( partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ) , where particles hop with rate @xmath85 to the right and rate @xmath86 to the left , still satisfying the exclusion rule .",
    "weak asymmetry means @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the pasep height is implicitly defined through @xmath89 .",
    "one considers @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "then the height is @xmath92 .",
    "the correspondingly scaled height converges in the limit @xmath93 to the solution of the kpz equation  @xcite .",
    "a corresponding theorem is missing for the multi - component case .",
    "the proofs cited above rely on the integrable structure of the underlying stochastic model , like determinantal point processes , bethe ansatz , schur processes , and their generalization on the level of macdonald processes  @xcite .",
    "the extension of such techniques to several components has been explored only for a few models  @xcite .",
    "the scheme to be described is fairly general . but to keep track of the assumptions , it is convenient to consider a concrete class of stochastic lattice gases .",
    "the ahr model will then be a particular example .",
    "we consider a lattice gas having @xmath36 components with particles hopping on the one - dimensional lattice @xmath37 .",
    "the components are labeled by @xmath2 .",
    "the position of the @xmath94-th particle of type @xmath1 at time @xmath95 is denoted by @xmath96 .",
    "the particles hop according to a jump process with rates which are not written out explicitly here .",
    "we allow only for nearest neighbor jumps , _",
    "i.e. _ , hops from the current location @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "the jump rates are local and invariant under translations .",
    "they are independent of the particle label @xmath94 , but will depend in general on the type @xmath1 . by construction ,",
    "particles of type @xmath1 are conserved . to define the steady states one starts from a ring of @xmath98 sites with periodic boundary conditions and",
    "fixes the number @xmath99 of @xmath1 particles .",
    "it is assumed that the dynamics explores the whole set of configurations at given @xmath100 .",
    "there is then a unique invariant measure @xmath101 and it is also ensured that there are no further conservation laws .",
    "we now take the infinite volume limit of @xmath101 through @xmath102 at fixed @xmath103 . in principle",
    "the system could phase segregate .",
    "formally this will be excluded by assuming that @xmath104 , the infinite volume steady state at density @xmath105 , is translation invariant , ergodic with respect to translation , and has truncated correlations which decay to 0 as the separation of the reference points goes to infinity .",
    "such properties can be handled only case by case with no general abstract argument available , in sharp contrast to lattice gases satisfying detailed balance  @xcite . in the following we fix @xmath105 and assume the above properties for @xmath104 including a small neighborhood of @xmath105 .",
    "the object of interest is the stationary process , denoted again by @xmath96 , with initial measure @xmath104 . in our notation",
    "the dependence on the reference density @xmath105 will be mostly suppressed .",
    "next we introduce the conserved fields @xmath106 which is the number of particles of type @xmath1 at @xmath107 .",
    "( for the tasep one identifies @xmath108 with @xmath44 from section  [ single ] .",
    ") @xmath109 is a stationary process and by assumption @xmath110 almost surely .",

    "clearly , @xmath122 is symmetric and non - negative . to avoid a completely frozen component",
    ", we require that @xmath122 has strictly positive eigenvalues , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath123 . as discussed in the appendix [ appb ] , using space - time stationarity , for the first moment one has the identity @xmath124 where @xmath125 @xmath126 is regarded as a @xmath127 matrix . as a consequence @xmath128 with @xmath129 denoting transpose .",
    "( [ 15a ] ) ensures in particular that @xmath126 has real eigenvalues .",
    "the dependence on the background density @xmath105 will be mostly suppressed from our notation .",
    "@xmath130 can be viewed as the average density of @xmath131 caused by an initial perturbation of the @xmath6 density at the origin . on large scales",
    "one might hope to capture such a response by a hydrodynamic theory .",
    "the first step is to consider density fields @xmath132 varying on the macroscopic scale .",
    "they satisfy the system of conservation laws @xmath133 linearizing as @xmath134 one arrives at @xmath135 with @xmath126 of ( [ 15 ] ) . on this level of precision @xmath136 which implies , denoting by @xmath137 the eigenvalues of @xmath126 , that @xmath138 has @xmath36 peaks centered at @xmath139",
    ". of course , some of the @xmath4 s might coincide and some of the peaks might be missing because of particular symmetries . with this background information",
    "the real issue becomes to understand the broadening of the peaks because of dissipation and noise .",

    "@xmath143 , @xmath144 are constrained by @xmath145 the gaussian fluctuation theory fails already for a single component .",
    "hence , as for @xmath13 , we expand the euler currents up to second order yielding the hessians @xmath146 adding to ( [ 20a ] ) one arrives at the nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics @xmath147 where @xmath148 denotes the inner product in component space .",
    "since @xmath131 is stationary , we will study the space - time stationary solution to ( [ 20 ] ) , here denoted by @xmath149 , with @xmath150 since a small deviation from uniformity is considered .",
    "using @xmath151 and the identity ( [ 15a ] ) , @xmath126 has real eigenvalues and a non - degenerate system of left and right eigenvectors .",
    "therefore one can introduce the normal mode coordinates @xmath152 through @xmath153 such that @xmath154 in addition we require the normal modes to be orthonormal in the steady state , which means @xmath155 up to an overall factor of @xmath114 , the transformation matrix @xmath156 is then uniquely defined .",
    "the @xmath156 matrix acts only in component space . therefore the definition ( [ 24 ] ) applies also to the fourier transformed fields and to the currents . in the same way",

    "on the other hand , the leading couplings @xmath372 , @xmath373 do not vanish and the two modes are still interacting through the sub - subleading terms @xmath374 , @xmath375 , which are of the same order of magnitude as the leading terms .",
    "with very high precision we confirm that the two modes satisfy kpz scaling , including the scaling function and the dependence on the non - universal coefficients .",
