    "the purpose of this paper is to present a discrete model of the two - dimensional quantum oscillator that is both superintegrable and exactly solvable .",
    "the wavefunctions of this system will be given in terms of the two - variable meixner polynomials and the constants of motion will be seen to satisfy the @xmath1 algebra .",
    "a considerable amount of literature can be found on superintegrable systems and there is a sustained interest in enlarging the documented set of models with that property .",
    "recall that a quantum system with @xmath2 degrees of freedom governed by a hamiltonian @xmath3 is said to be superintegrable if it possesses , including @xmath3 itself , @xmath4 algebraically independent constants of motion , that is operators that commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "the quintessential example of a quantum superintegrable system is the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator , whose constants of motion generate the @xmath1 algebra .",
    "one of the motivating observations behind the study of superintegrable systems is that they are exactly solvable , which makes them prime candidates for modeling purposes . also of importance is the fact that these systems form a bedrock for the analysis of symmetries , of the associated algebraic structures and their representations , and of special functions .",
    "the majority of quantum superintegrable models cataloged so far comprises continuous systems , but there has also been some progress in the study of discrete systems ; for a review on superintegrable systems ( mostly continuous ones ) and their applications , see .    in the past years",
    ", several discrete models of the one - dimensional quantum oscillator , either finite or infinite , were introduced .",
    "the most studied system , originally proposed in as a model of multimodal waveguides with a finite number of sensor points , has @xmath1 as its dynamical algebra . in this model ,",
    "the hamiltonian , the position and momentum operators are expressed in terms of @xmath1 generators , the eigenstates of the system are the basis vectors of unitary irreducible representations of @xmath1 and the wavefunctions are expressed in terms of the one - variable krawtchouk polynomials . as a result ,",
    "the hamiltonian has a finite number of eigenvalues and the spectra of the position and momentum operators are both discrete and finite .",
    "germane to the present paper is also the discrete oscillator model based on the univariate meixner polynomials and related to the @xmath5 algebra considered in .",
    "see also @xcite , where instead the meixner - pollaczek polynomials are involved .",
    "the krawtchouk one - dimensional finite / discrete oscillator has been exploited to construct finite / discrete systems in two dimensions .",
    "two approaches have been used .",
    "the first approach consist in taking the direct product of two one - dimensional @xmath1 systems to obtain a system defined on a square grid with @xmath6 as its dynamical algebra . in the second approach ,",
    "the isomorphism @xmath7 is exploited to obtain a description of the finite oscillator on the square grid in terms of discrete radial and angular coordinates . in the continuum limit ,",
    "both of these models tend to the standard two - dimensional oscillator .",
    "however , they do not exhibit the @xmath1 invariance , or symmetry algebra , of the standard two - dimensional oscillator .",
    "recently another discrete and finite model of the two - dimensional oscillator was proposed .",
    "this model is defined on a triangular lattice of a given size and , like the standard oscillator in two dimensions , it is superintegrable and has @xmath1 for symmetry algebra .",
    "the wavefunctions of the model , which support irreducible representations of @xmath1 at fixed energy , are given in terms of the two - variable krawtchouk polynomials introduced by griffiths @xcite .",
    "these polynomials of two discrete variables are orthogonal with respect to the trinomial distribution .",
    "as required , this model tends to the standard two - dimensional oscillator in the continuum limit .",
    "shortly after appeared , it was recognized that the @xmath2-variable krawtchouk polynomials of griffiths arise as matrix elements of the unitary representations of the rotation group @xmath8 on oscillator states .",
    "this interpretation has provided a cogent framework for the characterization of these orthogonal functions and has led to a number of new identities .",
    "the group theoretical interpretation was also extended to two other families of discrete multivariate polynomials : the multivariate meixner and charlier polynomials , orthogonal with respect to the negative multinomial and multivariate poisson distributions , respectively .",
    "the multi - variable meixner polynomials , also introduced by griffiths @xcite , were shown to arise as matrix elements of unitary representations of the pseudo - rotation group @xmath9 on oscillator states .",
    "as for the multivariate charlier polynomials , they were first introduced as matrix elements of unitary representations of the euclidean group on oscillator states .",
    "let us note that these family of multivariate polynomials also arise in probability theory in connection with the so - called lancaster distributions @xcite .    in this paper , we present a new discrete oscillator model in two - dimensions based on the two - variable meixner polynomials .",
    "the model is defined on the regular infinite - dimensional @xmath0 lattice .",
    "it is governed by a hamiltonian involving three independent parameters expressed as a 7-point difference operator .",
    "this operator is obtained by combining the two independent difference equations satisfied by the bivariate meixner polynomials . by construction ,",
    "the wavefunctions of the model are given in terms of these two - variable polynomials .",
    "the energies of the system are given by the non - negative integers @xmath10 and exhibit a @xmath11-fold degeneracy .",
    "using the raising and lowering relations for the two - variable meixner polynomials , the constants of motion of the system are constructed and are shown to close onto the @xmath1 commutation relations . in the continuum limit , in which the lattice parameter tends to zero , the model contracts to the standard quantum harmonic oscillator , as required for a discrete oscillator model .",
    "the contraction process is illustrated at the wavefunction level using the two - variable charlier polynomials in an intermediary step .",
    "the continuum limit is also displayed at the level of operators .",
    "here is the outline of the paper . in section two",
    ", the essential properties of the two - variable meixner polynomials are reviewed . in section three ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is defined , the constants of motion are constructed , and the wavefunctions are illustrated . in section four , the continuum limit of the model and wavefunctions is examined .",
    "we conclude with an outlook .",
    "we now review the properties of the two - variable meixner polynomials using the formalism and notation developed in .",
    "let @xmath12 be a positive real number and let @xmath13 be a @xmath14 pseudo - rotation matrix .",

    "we now consider the hamiltonian obtained by taking the sum of the operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 involved in the eigenvalue equations .",
    "we hence define @xmath52 in principle the hamiltonian involves four independent parameters including @xmath53 , as any matrix @xmath13 depends on three independent parameters .",
    "however , it turns out that @xmath54 essentially depends only on three parameters , including @xmath53 .",
    "this can be seen explicitly as follows .",
    "consider the following parametrization of @xmath15 in terms of the `` euler angles '' @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 : @xmath58 upon using the expressions , it is seen that in the parametrization the hamiltonian has the expression @xmath59+\\big[\\cosh",

    "the @xmath67 symmetry of the hamiltonian explains why @xmath54 depends on three parameters instead of four : the @xmath57 parameter in has been `` rotated away '' from the hamiltonian by the choice of parametrization .    by construction ,",
