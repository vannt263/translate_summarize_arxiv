    "most studies of neutralino production @xmath8 and decay of neutralinos have been performed in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "( see , for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein . ) usually , in these studies the spin correlations between the production and decay process have been neglected .",
    "it is expected that these spin correlations are important in the angular distributions .",
    "angular distributions and angular correlations of the decay products of neutralinos can give valuable information on their mixing character .",
    "their measurement is very suitable for constraining the parameter space of the mssm . in this contribution",
    "we study @xmath9 with the subsequent decay @xmath10 , including the complete spin correlations of @xmath2 .",
    "we also take into account beam polarization .",
    "we give numerical results for polarized cross sections , forward ",
    "backward asymmetries , lepton angular distributions , lepton opening angular distributions and lepton energy distributions at @xmath11  gev .",
    "both the production process , @xmath12 , and the decay process , @xmath13 contain contributions from @xmath14 exchange and from @xmath15 and @xmath16 exchange .",
    "a treatment of these processes properly taking into account the polarization of @xmath2 has been given in @xcite following the method of @xcite .",
    "the amplitude @xmath17 of the combined process is a product of the helicity amplitude @xmath18 for the production process times the helicity amplitude @xmath19 for the decay process and the propagator @xmath20^{-1}$ ] of @xmath2 with helicity @xmath21 , summed over @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 denote the four  momentum squared , mass and width of @xmath2 .",
    "the amplitude squared @xmath25 is thus composed of the unnormalized spin density production matrix @xmath26 of @xmath2 and the decay matrix @xmath27 .",
    "interference terms between various helicity amplitudes preclude factorization in a production factor @xmath28 times a decay factor @xmath29 .",
    "the analytical formulae are given in @xcite .",
    "neutralinos are linear superpositions of the photino @xmath30 and the zino @xmath31 and the two higgsinos @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the composition of the neutralino states depend on the three susy mass parameters @xmath34 ( with the gut relation @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 , and on the ratio @xmath37 of the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields @xcite .",
    "the masses of the sleptons are determined by the common scalar mass parameter @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we shall consider two representative scenarios which differ significantly in the nature of the two lowest mass eigenstates @xmath41 and @xmath2 : ( a ) m=380 gev , @xmath42 gev , @xmath43 , @xmath44 gev ; ( b ) m=185 gev , @xmath45 gev , @xmath46 , @xmath47 gev .",
    "using the short  hand notation @xmath48 , in ( a ) both neutralinos @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 gev have strong higgsino components . in ( b ) @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 gev have dominating gaugino components , @xmath41 being almost a pure bino and @xmath2 nearly a pure wino .      the total cross section for the combined process is independent of spin correlations @xcite . for unpolarized beams",
    "it is 4.7  fb in scenario ( a ) and 4.1  fb in scenario ( b ) .      in figs .  1 and 2 we present numerical results for the distribution @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the angle between the outgoing leptons @xmath55 and the electron beam in the laboratory system .",
    "we compare our results with those assuming factorization of the differential cross section into production and decay ( figs .",
    "the spin effect is largest in the forward and backward direction . for gaugino - like neutralinos",
    "it amounts to about @xmath56 , for higgsino  like neutralinos it is smaller .",
    "the resulting forward - backward asymmetry @xmath57 depends sensitively on the mixing character of the neutralinos .",
    "for higgsino - like neutralinos ( scen .",
    "( a ) ) the angular distribution is nearly forward ",
    "backward symmetric with a minimum at @xmath58 for gaugino - like neutralinos ( scen .",
    "( b ) ) , however , the forward hemisphere is favoured ( table  1 ) .",
    "owing to the majorana character of the neutralinos the distribution @xmath59 of the opening angle between both outgoing leptons factorizes .",
    "the distributions are completely different for scenario ( a ) .",
    "( fig .  6 ) and ( b ) ( fig .  7 ) . for gaugino - like neutralinos",
    "it is rather flat with a maximum near @xmath60 , whereas for higgsino  like neutralinos it is much steeper with a peak at @xmath61 ( notice the different scales in figs .  6 and 7 ) . for gaugino - like neutralinos the position of the maximum depends strongly on the kinetic energy of the decaying neutralino",
    ". with increasing kinetic energy it moves from @xmath62 to @xmath63 . for higgsino - like neutralinos",
    "the maximum is always at @xmath63 , but the distribution becomes much steeper with increasing energy . in both scenarios most of the leptons are emitted with an opening angle between 0 and @xmath62 ( approximately @xmath64 for scen .",
    "( a ) and @xmath65 for scen .",
    "the opening angle distribution depends only slightly on the value of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , this distribution is more suitable for the discrimination between gaugino- and higgsino - like neutralinos than the lepton angular distribution which has a stronger @xmath38 dependence ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "we have computed the angular and energy distributions for longitudinal polarization @xmath66 of the electron beam and @xmath67 of the positron beam ( @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) for right - handed ( left - handed ) polarized beams ) .    in the following the different polarization states ared denoted by the sign of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , ( 0 0 ) denotes the case of unpolarized beams .    in table  1",
    "the total cross sections for the different beam polarizations are given in increasing order of magnitude .",
    "for higgsino - like neutralinos the cross section is highest for right - handed electrons and left - handed positrons .",
    "for the gaugino case it is highest for left - handed electrons and right - handed positrons due to the wino - like character of @xmath2 . for gaugino - like neutralinos",
    "the dependence on the beam polarization is also more pronounced than for the higgsino case .",
    ".total cross sections and asymmetries for different combinations ( sign@xmath70,sign@xmath71 ) of electron polarization @xmath72 and positron polarization @xmath73 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for higgsino - like neutralinos the distribution is nearly independent of the beam polarization and almost the same as for unpolarized beams ( fig .  3 )",
    "similarly , for the gaugino - like scenario ( b ) and left - handed electrons only the magnitude of the distribution changes for different positron polarization ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the consequence of non - factorization of the angular distribution in production and decay is most pronounced for gaugino - like neutralinos and right - handed electrons ( fig .  5 ) .    for unpolarized beams the differential cross section @xmath74 is larger in the forward hemisphere . for @xmath75-polarization ( + 0 )",
    "the distribution is nearly symmetric . for beam polarization",
    "@xmath76 the backward hemisphere is favoured .",
    "also in the case of polarized beams the opening angle distribution factorizes into the contributions from production and decay due to the majorana nature of the neutralino . in both scenarios",
    "the only effect of beam polarization is to increase or to reduce the cross sections without changing the shape .",
    "the dependence on beam polarization is the same as that for the total cross section , table  1 .",
    "it is different for gaugino- and higgsino - like neutralinos .",
    "( 6@xmath777 ) shows the opening angle distribution for different beam polarization for higgsino - like neutralinos , scen .",
    "( a ) and for gaugino - like neutralinos , scen .",
    "( b ) .",
    "the energy distributions of the outgoing leptons in the laboratory frame again factorize due to the majorana character of the decaying @xmath2 .",
    "since in both scenarios the shape is very similar , we only show the energy spectra of @xmath55 for scen .",
    "( b ) and different combinations of beam polarization ( fig .",
    "as a consequence of factorization the shape is independent of beam polarization .",
    "because of cp invariance and the majorana character the energy spectra of @xmath55 and @xmath78 are identical @xcite .",
    "we have studied the production of neutralinos , @xmath79 with polarized beams and the subsequent leptonic decay , @xmath80 .",
    "we have fully taken into account the spin correlations between production and decay .",
    "the lepton angular and energy distributions , and the distribution of the opening angle between the outgoing leptons at @xmath11  gev have been computed for two representative scenarios .",
    "the quantum mechanical interference effects modify appreciably the decay lepton angular distributions . especially for gaugino - like",
    "neutralinos we find contributions up to @xmath56 from spin correlations between production and decay .",
    "the shape of the angular distributions depends on the beam polarization .",
    "the effect of spin correlations is strong for right - handed electrons and gaugino  like neutralinos . it is smaller for left - handed electrons in both scenarios considered .",
    "the mixing character of the neutralinos influences the beam polarization dependence of the total cross section .",
    "therefore , the polarization of both beams is very useful for constraining the parameters of the mssm .",
    "owing to the majorana character of the neutralinos the quantum mechanical interference effects between various polarization states of the decaying neutralino @xmath2 cancel in the energy spectrum and in the distribution of the @xmath81-opening angle .",
    "consequently , these distributions factorize into production and decay similarly to the case of spinless particles . accordingly , the shape of these distributions is independent of the beam polarization .",

    "we are grateful to v.  latussek for his support in the development of the numerical program .",
