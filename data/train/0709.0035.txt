    "in recent years , there has been extensive research on designing practical encoding / decoding schemes to approach theoretical limits of mimo fading systems .",
    "the optimal rate - diversity trade - off @xcite is considered as an important theoretical benchmark for practical systems . for the encoding part , recently , several lattice codes are introduced which have the non - vanishing determinant property and achieve the optimal trade - off , conditioned on using the exact maximum - likelihood decoding @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the lattice structure of these codes facilitates the encoding . for the decoding part , various lattice decoders , including the sphere decoder and the lattice - reduction - aided decoder are presented in the literature @xcite @xcite . to achieve the exact maximum likelihood performance , we need to find the closest point of the lattice inside the constellation region , which can be much more complex than finding the closest point in an infinite lattice . to avoid this complexity",
    ", one can perform the traditional lattice decoding ( for the infinite lattice ) and then , discard the out - of - region points .",
    "this approach is called naive lattice decoding ( nld ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have shown that this sub - optimum decoding ( and even its lattice - reduction - aided approximation ) still achieve the maximum receive diversity in the fixed - rate mimo systems .",
    "achieving the optimal receive diversity by a low decoding complexity makes lattice - reduction - aided decoding ( using the lll reduction ) an attractive choice for different applications .",
    "nonetheless , this work shows that concerning rate - diversity trade - off , the optimality can not be achieved by the naive - lattice decoding or its approximations .    in @xcite , using a probabilistic method , a lower bound on the best achievable trade - off , using the naive lattice decoding ,",
    "is presented . in this paper , we present an upper bound on the performance of the naive lattice decoding for codes based on full - rate lattices . we show that nld can not achieve the optimum rate - diversity trade - off .",
    "also , for the special case of equal number of transmit and receive antennas , we show that even the best full - rate lattice codes ( including perfect space - time codes such as the golden code @xcite ) can not perform better than the simple v - blast ( if we use the naive lattice decoding at the receiver ) .",
    "it should be noted that in this paper , we have assumed that the underlying lattice is fixed for different rates and snr values ( e.g. lattice codes introduced in @xcite @xcite @xcite ) . if we relax this restriction , there can exist a family of lattice codes ( based on different lattice structures for different rates and snr values ) which achieves the optimum tradeoff using the naive lattice decoding @xcite .",
    "in section iv , we complement the result of @xcite by showing that for the special case of equal number of transmit and receive antennas , although the naive lattice decoding ( and its lll - aided approximation ) still achieve the maximum receive diversity , their gap with the optimal ml decoding grows unboundedly with snr .",
    "we consider a multiple - antenna system with _",
    "m _ transmit antennas and _ n _ receive antennas . in a multiple - access system , we consider different transmit antennas as different users .",
    "if we consider @xmath0^{t } $ ] , @xmath1^{t } $ ] , @xmath2^{t } $ ] and the @xmath3 matrix @xmath4 , as the received signal , the transmitted signal , the noise vector and the channel matrix , respectively , we have the following matrix equation : @xmath5 the channel is assumed to be raleigh , i.e. the elements of @xmath4 are i.i.d with the zero - mean unit - variance complex gaussian distribution , and the noise is gaussian .",
    "also , we have the power constraint on the transmitted signal , @xmath6 .",
    "the power of the additive noise is @xmath7 per antenna , i.e. @xmath8 . the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is defined as @xmath9 .",
    "we send space - time codewords @xmath10 $ ] with complex entries ( @xmath11 ) and at the receiver , we find @xmath12 as @xmath13 where @xmath14 $ ] is the closest @xmath15-dimensional lattice point to @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "to drive the upper bound on the rate - diversity trade - off of nld , we first present a lower bound on the probability that the received lattice ( the lattice code after passing through the fading channel ) has a short vector .",
    "assume that the entries of the @xmath3 matrix @xmath4 has independent complex gaussian distributions with zero mean and unit variance and consider @xmath17 as the minimum distance of the lattice generated by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the full - rank @xmath20 generator of a given complex lattice with unit volume is defined as @xmath21 , and is equal to the volume of the fundamental region of the lattice .",
    "] and @xmath22 is the @xmath23 block diagonal matrix constructed by repeating @xmath24 along the main diagonal .",
    "we have , @xmath25    consider @xmath26 the nonzero singular values of @xmath4 . considering the pdf of the singular values of a gaussian matrix @xcite , it can be shown that @xcite    @xmath27    thus    @xmath28 @xmath29    @xmath30    consider @xmath31 as the singular vector of @xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath32 . for each @xmath33-dimensional complex vector @xmath34^{\\mathsf{t}}$ ] ,    @xmath35    thus , assuming @xmath36 , @xmath37    consider @xmath38 as a @xmath39-dimensional hypercube with edges of length @xmath40 whose @xmath41 edges are parallel to the subspace spanned by the vectors @xmath34^{\\mathsf{t}}$ ] and the other @xmath42 edges are orthogonal to that subspace .",
    "the volume of this cube is @xmath43 .",
    "because the volume of the lattice is 1 , for @xmath44 , the number of lattice points inside this cube , we have @xmath45 .",
    "now , assuming @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the region @xmath48 is inside a @xmath39-dimensional orthotope ( in the subspace spanned by @xmath49 ) whose @xmath50 edges ( which correspond to the smallest singular value @xmath51 ) have length @xmath52 and the length of the other @xmath53 is at most @xmath54 ( because of the bound on the largest singular value @xmath55 ) .",
    "the @xmath56 smaller edges can be covered by at most @xmath57 segments of length @xmath58 and the others can be covered by at most @xmath59 segments of length @xmath58 .",
    "thus , this orthotope can be covered by at most @xmath60 hypercubes of edge length @xmath61 . because @xmath45 , when @xmath62 , the number of these small hypercubes is smaller than the number of lattice points inside them .",
    "thus , based on dirichlet s box principle , in one of these hypercubes there are at least 2 points of the new lattice , hence @xmath63 is smaller than the diameter of the small hyper cubes : @xmath64    therefore ,    @xmath65    consider a mimo fading channel with @xmath66 transmit and @xmath67 receive antennas ( @xmath68 ) with codebooks from an @xmath33-dimensional lattice @xmath19 , which are sent over @xmath69 channel uses . for the naive lattice decoding ,",
    "the rate - diversity trade - off of the system is    @xmath70 @xmath71    consider the code of rate @xmath72 constructed from the lattice .",
    "the number of codewords is equal to @xmath73 . without any loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that the volume of the lattice is fixed and is equal to 1 , and the power constraint @xmath74 is dependent on the rate . to satisfy the power constraint ,",
    "at least half of the codewords should have power less than @xmath75 .",
    "the number of codewords with power less than @xmath76 is equal to the number of lattice points inside a @xmath77-dimensional sphere whose volume is proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "thus , by approximating the number of lattice points with the ratio of the volume of the region and the volume of the lattice :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is a constant , independent of snr are only dependent on size of dimensions . ] . according to the definition of the multiplexing gain , @xmath81 . using ( [ eq:6 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath82    for the symbol error probability @xmath83 , considering @xmath84 ,    @xmath85    therefore , using lemma 1 ( with @xmath86 ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) , @xmath87    @xmath88    @xmath89    @xmath90    @xmath91    in a mimo fading channel with @xmath92 transmit and receive antennas , if we use the naive lattice decoding , the rate - diversity trade - off for full - rate lattice code can not be better than that of v - blast .    when @xmath93 , according to theorem 1 ,    @xmath94    on the other hand , for the v - blast system with lattice decoding @xcite , @xmath95    it is interesting to compare this result with the results on lattice space - time codes which have non - vanishing determinants .",
    "although by ml decoding , these codes ( such as the @xmath96 golden code ) achieve the optimal rate - diversity trade - off , when we replace ml decoding with the naive lattice decoding ( and its approximations ) , their performance is not much better than the simple v - blast scheme ( specially when the number of transmit and receive antennas are the same )        to better understand the difference between the naive lattice decoding and the ml decoding , we note that for small constellations , when the generator of the received lattice has a small singular value , the minimum distance of the lattice can be much smaller than the minimum distance of the constellation .",
    "figure 2 shows this situation for a small 4-point constellation from a 2-dimensional lattice .    we should note that this upper bound is for full - rate lattices .",
    "lattices with lower rate , can provide higher diversity , but their rate is limited by the dimension of the lattice .",
    "for example , the alamouti code , based on qam constellations , can achieve the full diversity for fixed rates ( @xmath97 ) , but its rate is limited by one .    ) , compared to the minimum distance of a lattice code ( @xmath98 ) ]",
    "in @xcite , it is shown that for @xmath99 , the naive lattice decoding achieves the receive diversity in v - blast systems ( indeed , even its simple latice - reduction - aided approximation still achieves the optimum receive diversity of order @xmath100 ) .",
    "however , there is a difference between two cases of @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "while for @xmath101 , compared to ml decoding , the performance loss of the naive lattice decoding is bounded in terms of snr @xcite , here we show this is not valid for the case of @xmath93 .",
    "this dichotomy is related to the bounds on the probability of having a short lattice vector in a lattice generated by a random gaussian matrix .    in @xcite , an upper bound on the probability of having a short lattice vector",
    "is given :    assume that the entries of the @xmath103 matrix @xmath4 has independent complex gaussian distributions with zero mean and unit variance and consider @xmath104 as the minimum distance of the lattice generated by @xmath105 .",
    "then , there is a constant @xmath106 such that @xcite , @xmath107    the term @xmath108 suggests an unboundedly increasing gap between the performance of ml decoding and the naive lattice decoding ( though both of them have the same slope @xmath109 ) .    in this section",
    ", we present a lower bound on the error probability of the naive lattice decoding and show that this unboundedly increasing gap does exist .    for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , for the lattice generated by an @xmath103 random complex gaussian matrix @xmath4 with zero mean and unit variance , there is a constant @xmath112 such that , @xmath113    consider @xmath114 as the lattice generated by @xmath115,@xmath116, ... ,@xmath117 .",
    "each point of @xmath114 can be represented by @xmath118 , where @xmath119 are complex integer numbers .    the vectors @xmath115,@xmath116, ... ,@xmath117 are independent and jointly gaussian . therefore , for every complex vector @xmath120 , the vector @xmath121 has complex circular gaussian distribution with the variance    @xmath122    now , considering the pdf of @xmath123 , we can bound @xmath124 by using the fact that @xmath125 for @xmath126 :    @xmath127    thus , because the volume of region of the integral ( which is a @xmath77-dimensional sphere with radius @xmath128 ) is proportional to @xmath129 ,    @xmath130    we can represent any @xmath131-dimensional complex integer vector as a @xmath132-dimensional real integer vector . in our proof",
    ", we consider only integer vectors in the set @xmath133 which consists of integer vectors @xmath134 such that their real entries do not have a nontrivial common divisor and @xmath135 where @xmath136 represents the norm of the largest real entry .",
    "first , we show that the number of such integer vectors @xmath137 in the region @xmath138 is at least @xmath139 .",
    "the total number of integer points in the region @xmath138 is is @xmath140 and the number of points in the cube @xmath141 is @xmath142 . ]",
    "the number of those points whose entries have a common divisor @xmath144 is at most equal to the number of integer points in the region @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , @xmath146 , the number of integer vectors @xmath137 whose entries does not have nontrivial common divisors , can be lower bounded by    @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath151 @xmath152 @xmath153    . ]    now , we find an upper bound on @xmath154 for two different complex integer vectors @xmath155 and @xmath156 which belong to @xmath157",
    ". we can write @xmath155 as @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a complex number and @xmath160 is a complex vector , orthogonal to @xmath156 .",
    "we show that @xmath161 .",
    "the area of the triangle which has vertexes @xmath162 , @xmath155 , and @xmath163 , is equal to @xmath164 . on the other hand , because @xmath162 , @xmath155 , and @xmath163 are integer points , @xmath165 should be integer . also , because the entries of @xmath155 do not have any nontrivial common divisor , @xmath155 can not be a multiplier of @xmath163 ( and vice versa ) . because @xmath155 and @xmath163 are not multipliers of each other , @xmath166 is nonzero .",
    "thus , @xmath167 , hence ,    @xmath168    @xmath169    now we bound @xmath170 . because @xmath171 , we can see that @xmath172 .",
