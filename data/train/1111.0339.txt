    "the statistics of @xmath43 can be most conveniently described in terms of its logarithm @xmath46 as shown in ref .",
    "( section 3.2.2 ) , the statistics of @xmath47 is given by a functional integral , which involves a diffusion - type quadratic action in @xmath47 and a delta - function constraint imposing the normalization of the wave function @xmath48 .",
    "an accurate treatment of that functional integral is difficult , and we simplify it by observing that the tails of @xmath35 contribute very little to the normalization , and therefore the normalization - enforcing delta - function term is of little importance for the tails of @xmath35 .",
    "the normalization is mostly determined by the maxima of @xmath47 , and therefore the main role of this delta - term is to normalize the maxima of the function @xmath47 .",
    "we expect that the distribution of the maxima of @xmath47 has a width of order one and centered around zero .",
    "this suggests our approximation for studying the wave - function tails . instead of working with a full path integral of ref .",

    "we thus arrive at the following coarse - grained description of the ensemble of the envelopes @xmath47 : a localized state is determined by the location @xmath49 of its ( global ) maximum ( where @xmath54 ) and the functional measure for the tails ( which follows directly from the formula ( 3.34 ) of ref .  )",

    "is done at @xmath192 but we expect that the leading @xmath20 dependence is the same in both regimes ) . in the other cases ,",
    "there are no exact calculations to which our results reported in tables [ table : r ] and [ table : s ] could be compared , thus they should be considered as conjectures .",
    "to summarize , in this paper we propose a simple technique of treating correlation of wave functions in anderson localization in terms of hybridization of localized states . while the essence of our method repeats the well - known mott argument , supplementing it with a log - normal probability distribution for the tails of localized wave functions ( and , consequently , for the hybridization matrix elements ) gives the method a quantitative power .",
    "we have checked that the results produced with our simplified method reproduce quantitatively the main features of the available exact results ( obtained by more sophisticated techniques ) .",
    "nevertheless , we should emphasize that the presented method remains a phenomenological recipe , and its justification still needs to be completed .",
    "the method depends on several assumptions of various level of rigor . for the benefit of the reader",
    ", we list them below :    * a possibility to define localized wave functions that are further hybridized into the eigenstates ( [ hybrid ] ) close in energy .",
    "these wave functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 are not rigorously defined in our argument , and the formalization of this step would be helpful for a rigorous justification of the method . * the log - normal distribution of the wave - function tails ( [ pure - log - normal ] ) , supplemented by a suitable cutoff ( [ tail - log - normal ] ) .",
    "while we present some arguments in favor of these formulas , they are not formally derived .",
    "we hope that a rigorous derivation of this step may be possible with the methods of ref .  .",
    "* the hybridization matrix elements ( [ j - chi ] ) are assumed to be proportional to @xmath113 , the product of the two hybridizing tails , and therefore to obey the same log - normal distribution .",
    "since neither @xmath95 nor @xmath193 are formally defined , this assumption also remains a phenomenological construction .",
    "* the factor @xmath104 in ( [ j - chi ] ) reflecting the interference of channels .",
    "its probability distributions ( [ phi - distributions ] ) are introduced phenomenologically .",
    "note that , for different calculations , different assumptions play a role . at the mott length scale ( section [ sec : mott ] )",
    ", we only used the assumptions 1 and 3 , with the assumptions 2 and 4 being irrelevant . for the leading behavior at @xmath194 ( section [ sec : leading ] )",
    ", we also used the assumption 2 , while in section [ sec : subleading ] we additionally need the assumption 4 to calculate the subleading terms @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we wish to remark here that our method was developed under the specific assumption of a weak disorder ( specifically , it is applicable in the model of the gaussian white noise ) , which implies the single - parameter - scaling relation ( [ sps - relation ] ) between the variance and the average of the wave - function tail .",
    "however , the method can be extended to other interesting models of localization by relaxing this assumption .",
    "this would imply a modification of the log - normal probability distributions ( [ tail - log - normal ] ) and ( [ pure - log - normal ] ) in the assumptions 2 and 3 .",
    "one example where such a modification may be applicable is localization far below the mobility edge ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "another interesting example is the exactly solvable localization problem with the cauchy - distributed disorder considered in ref .  .",
    "in that model , the single - parameter - scaling relation ( [ sps - relation ] ) does apply , but with a different coefficient .",
    "we believe that such a system can also be treated by our method with a suitably modified probability distributions ( [ tail - log - normal ] ) and ( [ pure - log - normal ] ) .    finally , it would be interesting to extend our approach to higher dimensions .",
    "the key issue for such an extension is the log - normal distribution of the wave - function tails ( our assumption 2 above ) . while we are not aware of such results for wave functions in higher - dimensions , a similar claim was made for the probability distribution of the conductance @xcite .",
    "namely , it was shown that , in the weak - scattering case and in the insulating phase , the conductance distribution in the large - system - size limit is log - normal with the single - parameter - scaling relation between the average and the variance of the form ( [ sps - relation ] ) .",
    "therefore one may assume that a similar universal distribution is also valid for the wave - function tails .",
    "if it is indeed the case , then our calculations in sections [ sec : mott ] and [ sec : leading ] can be straightforwardly extended to higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , the counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ two - vs - single-1d ] ) in any dimension would read @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the area of the @xmath197-dimensional sphere ( e.g. , in our one - dimensional case , @xmath198 ) , and the definition ( [ mott - length ] ) of @xmath7 remains the same in any dimension .",
    "also , under the same conditions , the behavior of @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( the right column of tables [ table : r ] and [ table : s ] calculated in section [ sec : mott ] ) would be universal in any dimension .",
    "this implies , in particular , the validity of the mott formula for the frequency - dependent conductivity @xmath199 in any dimension ( which can be deduced from @xmath9 , see , e.g. , ref .  ) , in agreement with the original argument @xcite .",
