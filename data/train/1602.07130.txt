    "the connection between quantum and classical dynamics of hamiltonian systems is revealed in the semiclassical limit @xmath2 , where the effective dimension of the hilbert space grows indefinitely . for propagation up to times of the order of the heisenberg time @xmath3 ,",
    "the classical - quantum correspondence has been extensively used to explore the spectral correlations on the scale of the mean level spacing @xmath4 , see @xcite .",
    "particularly , for generic single particle systems with classically chaotic dynamics the universal spectral correlations were established via the statistical correlations of long periodic orbits . on the other hand ,",
    "at very short ( classical ) time scales the contribution to spectral correlation functions are provided by very few periodic orbits , implying that universality can not be expected @xcite .",
    "this conclusion , however , should be taken with a grain of salt for systems composed of a large number @xmath0 of particles , extensively studied in recent years @xcite .",
    "first , for many - particle systems even periodic orbits with short periods @xmath1 might acquire large actions due to the interactions between particles .",
    "second , in chaotic systems periodic orbits typically proliferate exponentially with @xmath0 , such that their number becomes very large already for short @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore a natural question whether a kind of universality can be expected in the regime of short times @xmath1 but large number of particles @xmath0 .    to resolve this question",
    "we introduce a duality - based approach .",
    "its main idea can be understood on a classical level : consider a system of @xmath0 particles with positions @xmath5 and momenta @xmath6 . at discrete points in time",
    "the system is kicked by a `` potential '' consisting of both harmonic nearest neighbor interaction between the particles and an arbitrary field , acting on each particle separately , _",
    "@xmath7 for two neighboring particles . for the resulting hamiltonian",
    "we also impose cyclic boundary conditions which render @xmath9 invariant under the shift @xmath10 , in particular we have @xmath11 . this model defined by ( [ prototypemodel ] )",
    "can be thought of as @xmath0 interacting kicked rotors .    written in coordinate form the dynamics of the model is described by the map @xmath12 + \\omega^2\\left [ x_{t , n+1}+ x_{t , n-1}-2x_{t , n}\\right]=v'(x_{t , n})\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 stands here for the coordinate of the @xmath14-th particle at time @xmath15 . remarkably , these equations stay invariant under the exchange of the particle and time indices @xmath16 if one simultaneously exchanges the model parameters @xmath17 . in particular",
    ", this implies that all @xmath1-periodic orbits of the @xmath0-particle system with parameters @xmath18 are in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath0-periodic orbits of a @xmath1-particle system with exchanged parameters @xmath19 .",
    "such a duality relation was first observed in the model of coupled cat maps @xcite .",
    "it was noticed there that such a property of the classical hamiltonian must imply a relation between the corresponding quantum evolutions . indeed ,",
    "since the trace of the quantum propagator can be expressed in the semiclassical limit through periodic orbits of period @xmath1 , one might expect in that limit the relation @xmath20 between the propagator @xmath21 of the @xmath0-particle system for the time @xmath1 and the propagator @xmath22 for the dual system of @xmath1 particles and time @xmath0 .",
    "the importance of relation ( [ qduality ] ) stems from the fact that it allows one to study the regime of short times @xmath1 and a large number of particles @xmath0 by converting it into one of large times and a small number of particles .",
    "the last one is often amenable to treatment by standard semiclassical methods .    here",
    ", we explore the existence of the relation ( [ qduality ] ) in a different class of models , namely kicked spin-1/2 chains first introduced in @xcite . in this class of models an underlying classical limit does not exist .",
    "nevertheless , as we show later on , an analogue of ( [ qduality ] ) holds in this case as well .",
    "we can exploit this to express the traces of the short - time propagator for large @xmath0 in terms of the ( by modulus ) largest eigenvalues of its dual counterpart .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we introduce the evolution operator of the kicked spin chain and in section [ sec : dualityrel ] its dual complement .",
    "we analyze the spectrum of this dual operator in different parameter regimes in section [ sec : specdop ] and conclude in section [ section5 ] .",
    "technical details are relegated to the appendix . in an accompanying paper",
    "we will discuss applications of this trace duality to the calculation of spectral densities and form factors in the limit of large particle numbers .",
    "the kic model @xcite is defined as a ring of @xmath0 spins with homogeneous nearest neighbor coupling and an additional magnetic field kicking the system .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath23 is therefore a sum of two contributions . the first part , @xmath24 is the standard ising - hamiltonian for spins @xmath25 where the components @xmath26 are the pauli matrices for spin @xmath27 .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 governs the coupling strength .",
    "the second part contains a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath29 providing the action @xmath30 of the kicks . for convenience , we measure time in dimensionless units . without loss of generality the magnetic field can be restricted to the @xmath31 plane , such that @xmath32 the floquet operator for one period of the time evolution is thus given by the product @xmath33 where @xmath34 correspond to free evolution and kicks , respectively .    depending on the strength of the coupling @xmath28 and the magnetic field",
    "@xmath35 the kic shows different regimes ranging from integrable dynamics to full chaos .",
    "given the lack of a classical limit the definition of chaoticity is based on the spectrum of @xmath36 , the system is said to be chaotic if the nearest neighbor spacing distributions obeys wigner - dyson statistics .",
    "in @xcite a dynamical characterization based on correlators between spins was found to be consistent with the above approach . due to symmetries",
    "it is sufficient to consider the parameters @xmath37 in the interval of @xmath38 to @xmath39 only .",

    "by the duality relation ( [ duality ] ) the entire information on the spectrum of @xmath36 can , in principle , be extracted from the spectra of the dual operators @xmath73 for @xmath104 .",
    "thus , it is of great interest to understand how the spectrum of @xmath105 depends on the system parameters and time @xmath1 .",
    "we start by providing numerically calculated eigenvalue distributions of @xmath105 that are typical for the different parameter regimes of @xmath28 and @xmath106 .",
    "afterwards , we explain in detail how the spectrum of the dual operator is obtained from ( [ partfunc])-([hgleich ] ) , considering the non - trivially integrable case .",
    "the properties of the dual eigenvalue spectrum @xmath107 crucially depend on the regime considered . in the chaotic regime , see figure [ fig1 ] , the bulk of the eigenvalues is placed within the unit disc , such that its boundary serves as the edge of the spectrum . increasing @xmath1 this boundary becomes sharper while the gap between the largest eigenvalues and the bulk of the spectrum shrinks to zero .",
    "generically , @xmath73 is non unitary .",
    "however , along the line @xmath108 and @xmath109 $ ] we find @xmath110 which implies that both @xmath36 and @xmath73 are unitary and differ only by their dimension .",
    "this special case is reminiscent of @xcite , where the dual operator is strictly unitary .",
    "close to the trivially integrable regime , as seen in figure [ fig2 ] , most of the eigenvalues are localized in the vicinity of zero with a large gap separating the bulk from the largest eigenvalues . in the limit of @xmath111",
    "the entire spectrum except for two eigenvalues collapses to zero . in the non - trivially integrable regime",
    "@xmath112 the spectrum of @xmath105 has a regular structure , see figure [ fig4 ] , with large degeneracies in the absolute values of the eigenvalues . in this case",
    "we can distinguish two qualitatively different regimes , the upper row in figure [ fig4 ] is reminiscent of the chaotic regime with its minimal inner radius . in the lower one ,",
    "the inner gap is closed and this reminds visually of the trivially integrable regime . understanding the distribution of the eigenvalues in more detail is possible , as they are analytically accessible by a map on an equivalent system of free fermions .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we only consider spin - chains with an even number @xmath0 of total spins .",
    "but it is straightforward to generalize this to odd @xmath0 , see [ appenda ] for details . if the parameters of the operator @xmath36 belong to the non - trivially integrable regime this holds as well for the dual operator as can be inferred from ( [ hgleich ] ) because @xmath113 implies @xmath114 . in this case both of the other parameters , @xmath59 and @xmath85 , turn out to be imaginary up to a constant real part , @xmath115 in [ appenda ] we derive an analytic form of the eigenvalues of @xmath36 and @xmath73 . in both cases",
    "the eigenvalues are given by structurally similar combinatorial products .",
    "in particular , for even @xmath1 each eigenvalue of @xmath73 can be labeled by a sequence of symbols @xmath116 , @xmath117 such that @xmath118 here , each factor @xmath119 is drawn out of a set of four elements , @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 , with real valued functions @xmath123 provided in [ appenda ] .",
    "the index @xmath124 denotes which of the elements contributes to ( [ eq : lambdacomb : body ] ) .",
    "whereas for @xmath36 the absolute values of @xmath125 are always one , making its spectrum unitary , we find that for @xmath73 this is not necessarily the case .",
    "instead , it depends on the sign of @xmath126 . specifically , @xmath127 only if @xmath126 is negative , in which case @xmath125 is complex , in the other case @xmath125 is real .",
    "it is therefore apparent that different @xmath128 combinations which have identical values @xmath124 for all real @xmath125 lead to eigenvalues with identical absolute value .",
    "however , they must not necessarily ber degenerate as they can differ in phase due to the complex @xmath125 . under the variation of the system parameters it might happen that one of the @xmath126 s changes its sign . at these parameters a pair of circles",
    "merges which also leads to a change in the degeneracies of the absolute values of @xmath129 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the outer circle of the spectrum , _ i.e. _  the eigenvalues of @xmath73 with the largest magnitude , as they provide the dominant contribution to traces of the evolution operator ( see ( [ duality ] ) ) in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the degeneracy of the eigenvalues is characterized by a non - negative integer parameter @xmath130 counting the number of sets @xmath131 with a negative @xmath126 .",
    "figure [ fig : pyramid ] shows its values in dependence of @xmath28 and @xmath62 . for the eigenvalues with the largest modulus all @xmath125 for which @xmath132 have to contribute in ( [ eq : lambdacomb : body ] ) leaving only @xmath14 sets from which the entries can be chosen freely . as the entry @xmath133 appears twice in the set ( [ eq : lambdaset : body ] ) both choices do not affect the value of @xmath134 and thus lead to a degeneracy .    in general , the spectrum at each circle can be split into @xmath135 multiplets , where the @xmath27-th multiplet @xmath136 is composed of @xmath137 distinct eigenvalues having the same degeneracy @xmath138 . by simple combinatorial arguments we show in [ appenda ] that for the outer spectral circle these numbers are given by @xmath139 using ( [ eq : degdef ] ) we can express the total number of eigenvalues as @xmath140 and the number of distinct eigenvalues by @xmath141 as figure [ fig : pyramid ] suggests we find abrupt transitions of these numbers in the parameter space which occur whenever the outer circle is replaced by one of the inner circles taking on its role .     for different parameters of @xmath28 and @xmath40 with either @xmath142 ( left ) or @xmath143 spins ( right ) .",

    "this gives access to a regime opposite to the usually considered limits of few particles but large times . to achieve this",
    "we relate the trace of @xmath147 to the trace of a dual operator @xmath148 whose dimension @xmath74 is in this regime significantly smaller than the dimension @xmath149 of the original matrix . up to a multiplicative correction factor",
    "this dual operator is still described by an evolution operator for the kic , albeit ( typically ) for complex parameters .",
    "our approach indicates that for short times the system can not explore the full hilbert space due to the short ranged interaction , in a broad sense such a reduction in complexity can also be used for the propagation of states and the calculation of their expectation values @xcite .    due to these complex parameters",
    ", it turns out that @xmath73 is non - unitary and features a rich structure , which depends on the parameter regime considered .",
    "for instance , we find a sharp contrast between the chaotic regimes , where the eigenvalues of @xmath73 posses an inner gap , and the trivially integrable regime , where it is not present . in the chaotic case",
    "the eigenvalues are distributed over a ring , while in the integrable regimes they are highly ordered . in the non",
    "trivially regime they are situated on concentric circles and highly degenerate , close to the trivially integrable regime all besides two eigenvalues tend to zero .",
    "given that the kic model does not have a classical limit , chaos in this system can not be defined via the dynamics of an underlying classical model .",
    "instead one has to refer to spectral statistics , for instance to the level spacing , or to correlators of the evolution operator @xmath36 .",
    "the structural properties of @xmath73 might yield an additional approach to analyze such properties and transitions between the regimes .    especially in the intermediate regimes",
    "the non - unitarity allows us to approximate powers of @xmath73 by the largest eigenvalues , a property which we use heavily to determine asymptotic properties of the form - factor and the spectral density in the accompanying paper . in the chaotic case",
    "no longer single eigenvalues are important but instead the distribution on the outer edge .",
    "it is an interesting question to which extend such a distribution can be modeled by a rmt ensemble of non - unitary matrices",
    ". this could give further insight into the originally posed question of universality for short times but large numbers of particles .    finally ,",
    "although we present the concept of the dual operator for the kic only , it can be extended to a broader class of systems . for kicked systems with nearest neighbor interaction",
    "this is a straight forward step and may also include disorder in time or particle direction .",

    "this modification leaves the total number of eigenvalues ( [ sumtotalev ] ) invariant , however the distinct eigenvalues ( [ sumdistinctev ] ) are then given by @xmath203 .",
