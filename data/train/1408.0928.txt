    "[ fig : scheme]b ) exploiting the spin - selective optical dipole force of a focused near - resonant laser beam @xcite .",
    "the beam is circularly - polarized , with a detuning of 560 mhz from the @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) transition , 50 @xmath73 m waist and 4 mw power .",

    "[ fig : scheme]b is caused by the different shape of the cloud after stern - gerlach deflection ( caused by the non - uniform intensity gradient ) : integrating the density profiles to obtain the total number of atoms gives the same population for each of the spin states within an experimental uncertainty @xmath74 .",
    "the starting point for our experiment is an ultracold @xmath2yb trapped gas at @xmath75 ( where @xmath31 is the fermi temperature ) and @xmath76 atoms per spin component . by slowly increasing the intensity of a 2d optical lattice in @xmath77 ms we produce an array of @xmath78 independent 1d fermionic wires , weakly confined by a harmonic potential along the wire axis .",
    "the final depth of the optical lattice ( operating at a wavelength @xmath79 nm ) is @xmath80 ( where @xmath81 is the recoil energy ) , resulting in a tight radial confinement with ( angular ) trapping frequency @xmath82 khz .",
    "since the energy @xmath83 is larger than the fermi energy by more than one order of magnitude , the occupation of excited radial modes is negligible , which makes our wires truly one - dimensional .",
    "furthermore , the tunnelling time between different wires is on the order of several seconds , much longer than the timescale of the experiments , which makes the wires effectively decoupled from each other .",
    "* interaction regime for two - component fermions . * the interaction regime for a two - component 1d fermi gas with contact interactions can be described by the dimensionless parameter @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the 1d density ( per spin component ) and @xmath86 is the 1d scattering length @xcite , given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the 3d scattering length ( + 10.58 nm for @xmath2yb ) and @xmath89 is the radial harmonic oscillator length . in our system we calculate a mean interaction parameter @xmath24 ( averaged over the atomic density , see next section ) , which lies in the strongly - interacting regime between the ideal fermi gas ( @xmath26 ) and the fully - fermionized gas ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in 1d the effect of collisions between particles is increased as the density is decreased , contrarily to the behaviour in higher dimensions . as a consequence ,",
    "the fermi pressure , which limits the density @xmath85 of a trapped fermionic gas by keeping its constituent particles away from each other , in 1d has the counterintuitive effect of making a system of fermions more interacting than one of bosons ( and of a classical gas as well ) .",
    "another relevant quantity is the luttinger parameter @xmath90 , which enters the low - energy hamiltonian .",
    "after bosonization @xcite , the hamiltonian in the charge ( density ) sector reads @xmath91 \\ ; , \\label{eq : luttinger}\\ ] ] which describes the free excitations of the luttinger liquid , formally equivalent to the modes of vibration of an elastic string ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 are conjugate bosonic fields describing the collective density excitations of the liquid ) .",
    "we use the word `` charge '' for a system of neutral atoms , in analogy to the common use in condensed - matter physics , to indicate excitations involving a perturbation of the total fermionic density ( as opposed to excitations in the spin sector , where the total density is constant and the local magnetization is perturbed ) .",
    "the @xmath90 parameter determines the power - law divergencies in some relevant properties of the luttinger liquid ( for instance , the momentum distribution @xmath12 around the fermi momentum ) and characterizes the sound velocity of its collective ( charge ) excitations , given by @xmath44 . in our system",

    "* effect of inhomogeneity and finite temperature .",
    "* the presence of an axial trapping potential , with ( angular ) frequency @xmath54 ranging from @xmath94 hz to @xmath95 hz ( the precise number depending on the particular experiment ) , causes the 1d fermionic wires to have a nonuniform density profile @xmath96 .",
    "additionally , moving out of the trap center , the number of atoms per wire is decreasing from a maximum of @xmath8 ( per spin component ) in the central wire , to a vanishing occupation of the more peripheral wires . in order to interpret our experimental findings",
    ", we have considered these two effects very carefully .",
    "the number of fermions @xmath97 in each wire has been calculated in the noninteracting case by determining the lowest - energy configuration of @xmath97 which satisfies both fermi statistics and the constraint on the total atom number @xmath98 .",
    "the calculation has been performed by taking into account a wire - dependent energy potential offset @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the particle mass , @xmath101 is the lattice spacing and @xmath102 are the ( angular ) frequencies of the slowly - varying harmonic trapping potentials in the orthogonal directions to the wires .",
    "the resulting atom distribution @xmath97 is a very good description of the experimental system , as we can verify by looking at the agreement between the experimental points and the theoretical curves for @xmath11 in figs .",
    "[ fig : nk]a and [ fig : spectra]a , where the only adjusted parameter is the temperature ( see below ) .",
    "those curves have been calculated by taking the momentum distribution @xmath12 and the dynamic structure factor for a homogeneous ideal gas @xmath103 , respectively , and treating the effects of the axial harmonic potential in a local density approximation ( lda ) , i.e. assuming that locally the properties of the system are described in terms of a local fermi wavevector @xmath104 .",
    "then we have averaged the result over all the wires , taking the number of atoms per wire as weight .",
    "the temperature assumed for both the calculations is @xmath105 , which well agrees with the @xmath106 ratio measured in the 3d fermi gas after ramping down the lattices from a fit of a polylogarithmic function @xcite to the time - of - flight density distribution .",
    "* momentum distribution of the 1d interacting liquids . * the momentum distribution of the 1d interacting liquids is measured by suddenly switching off the optical trapping potentials and detecting the atomic density with absorption imaging after a time - of - flight @xmath107 ms of ballistic expansion .",

    "we neglect the initial size of the trapped sample since it contributes by only @xmath108 to the size of the expanded cloud .",
    "we rule out a possible explanation of the observed changes in @xmath12 in terms of different temperatures for different @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , we have verified that , after slowly ramping down the lattices in @xmath77 ms to recover a 3d fermi gas , the temperature measured for the different spin mixtures has the same value @xmath105 for all @xmath0 within the experimental uncertainties . in this 3d regime",
    "the effects of interactions are very weak . as a matter of fact , for 3d fermi gases",
    "we have not detected any significative change in @xmath12 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this observation both makes the temperature measurement in 3d reliable and demonstrates that the observed increase in width comes from the increased correlations in the interacting 1d systems .",
    "the theoretical @xmath12 curves for @xmath13 in fig . [",
    "fig : nk]b have been calculated by taking into account the increased width of the trapped interacting spin mixture following the results of @xcite .",
    "this effect leads to a decrease of the density ( with respect to the noninteracting case ) and to a reduction of the fermi wavevector @xmath40 , which influences both the momentum distribution and the excitation spectrum .",
    "the mean - field @xmath12 curve has been calculated from the momentum distribution of an ideal fermi gas in an effectively weaker harmonic trap , which accounts for the increase in spatial width calculated for our interactions strength .",
    "the @xmath28 curves have been calculated by taking the results of refs . @xcite and @xcite for a homogeneous system and treating them with lda + average over the atom distribution in the wires .",
    "the temperature of the 1d fermionic wires is slightly below the characteristic temperature scale @xmath109 for spin excitations , over which the spin - incoherent luttinger liquid regime begins @xcite .",
    "this spin temperature corresponds to the maximum energy difference between different spin configurations . in the limit of large @xmath59 the bandwidth of the spin excitations",
    "can be estimated @xcite as @xmath110 , which corresponds to a spin temperature @xmath111 for our experimental parameters .    * bragg spectroscopy and excitation spectra .",
    "* bragg spectroscopy is performed by exciting the atomic cloud with two off - resonant laser beams @xcite .",
    "this technique allows the selective excitation of density waves with energy @xmath112 and momentum @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the ( angular ) frequencies and the wavevectors of the two bragg beams , respectively . in order to access the low - momentum part of the spectrum ,",
    "the @xmath79 nm bragg beams are aligned at a small angle , resulting in a momentum transfer @xmath35 along the wire axis ( being @xmath49 the fermi wavevector corresponding to the peak density of the central wire ) .",
    "bragg pulse length and intensity are chosen in such a way to result in a combined interaction - time and power broadening @xmath116 hz , much less than the width of the measured spectra . in order to both minimize the effect of laser phase fluctuations and",
    "increase the signal , the spectrum of each of the two bragg beams contains both the frequencies @xmath117 and @xmath118 , resulting in both left - moving and right - moving excitations .",
    "we quantify the bragg excitation by measuring the momentum transferred to the cloud by time - of - flight imaging .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the imaginary part of the response function @xmath119 , which is directy related to the dynamic structure factor @xmath103 by the relation @xmath120\\propto \\left [ s(q,\\omega)-s(-q,-\\omega)\\right ] \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : responsebragg}\\ ] ] which reduces to @xmath103 in the small - temperature limit @xcite .",
    "we note that , since the bragg light is far detuned with respect to any atomic resonance , the bragg perturbation acts equally on the different nuclear spin states , i.e. we are only exciting _ charge _ modes ( density waves ) and not _ spin _ modes ( spin waves ) @xcite , which would propagate with a different velocity .",
    "experimentally , we characterize the shift in the sound velocity by determining the frequency @xmath121 corresponding to the excitation peak .",
    "this quantity is obtained by performing a gaussian fit to the experimental points ( blue dashed lines in figs . [",
    "fig : spectra]b , c ) . by considering the full dynamic structure factor in the noninteracting case ,",
    "we have theoretically verified that @xmath121 depends linearly on the excitation momentum @xmath48 up to the value used in our measurements .",
    "this means that , despite the average over different inhomogeneous systems and the finiteness of our momentum transfer , we are effectively probing the low-@xmath38 regime of linear dispersion in the excitation spectrum .",
    "the theoretical shift in the sound velocity expected for the low-@xmath38 excitation spectrum in the @xmath13 case has been evaluated following the results of @xcite for the homogeneous system and performing the same lda + averaging procedure described previously .",
