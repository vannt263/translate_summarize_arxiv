    "the formation of star clusters in bursts of star formation during galactic mergers has attracted much attention since the ground - breaking study by schweizer ( 1986 ) .",
    "young clusters can account for @xmath4 of the uv light flux of their sample starburst galaxies ( compared with @xmath5 for the milky way ; e.g. meurer et al .",
    "such numbers bring to focus the role that star formation in clusters plays in shaping the overall ( galactic ) stellar mass function .",
    "proto - typical cases where cluster formation has been a spectacular manifestation of interaction - induced starbursts are the merging systems ngc 4038/39 ( the antenn ) and the nearby galaxy m82 ( recent interaction with m81 ) .",
    "many of the brightest clusters in these galaxies have estimated ages on the order of @xmath6 years , based on optical and near - ir spectra .",
    "high resolution spectroscopic data and hst images have been used to measure velocity dispersions and estimate virial masses .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath7 ( losvd ) relates to the mass @xmath8 and projected half - light radius @xmath9 of a cluster in virial equilibrium through @xmath10 where @xmath0 is a dimensionless free parameter .",
    "a number of authors have set @xmath11 in their studies to derive @xmath8 from ( [ eq : eta ] ) ( sternberg 1998 ; mengel et al . 2002 ; smith & gallagher 2001 ; mccrady et al . 2003 ; maraston et al . 2004 ) .",
    "mccrady et al . give a derivation of this value of @xmath0 .",
    "mengel et al . ( 2002 ) quote a range from @xmath12 for king ( 1966 ) models with concentration parameter in the range 0.5 to 2.5 , which corresponds to most galactic globular clusters .",
    "we discuss the value of @xmath0 further below .",
    "dynamical masses derived from ( [ eq : eta ] ) have been compared to the stellar masses of synthetic populations , using both standard ( field ) and non - standard stellar initial mass functions ( henceforth imf ; see kroupa 2002 for a review ) .",
    "the data were found to be inconsistent with a universal imf ( mengel et al . 2002 ; smith & gallagher 2001 ) .",
    "in particular , several clusters in m82 were found to be over - luminous with respect to their estimated mass ( low mass - to - light ratio , @xmath13 ) .",
    "this suggests that m82 clusters may form with a top - heavy stellar imf ( smith & gallagher 2001 ; mccrady et al .",
    "much of what we report in this section draws from boily et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .      the equations of motion were integrated numerically based on the gas - dynamical approach pioneered by larson ( 1970 ) and developed further by louis & spurzem ( 1991 ) to include anisotropic velocity fields .",
    "the method leans on an analogy between exchange of kinetic energy through star - star interactions and the classical heat - diffusion process of fluid dynamics ( lynden - bell & eggleton 1980 ; heggie & ramamani 1988 ) .",
    "the implementation in spherical coordinates we used is largely due to louis & spurzem ( 1991 ) and giersz & spurzem ( 1994 ) but extended to include a spectrum of stellar masses ( spurzem & takahashi 1995 ) .",
    "the mass spectrum is sampled at constant logarithmic increments in the interval @xmath14 ; we used 14 bins in our standard runs ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "to each mass bin corresponds the same initial ( continuous ) radial density profile .",
    "star - star interactions ( including those between stars of the same mass bin ) lead to the diffusion of kinetic energy . roughly speaking",
    ", the resulting change in the velocity dispersion of each mass bin causes a readjustment of the density profile .",
    "this is obtained using a semi - implicit henyey integration .",
    "the gravitational potential is then updated by applying poisson s equation ( see louis & spurzem 1991 ) .",
    "we checked that the mass - segregation time obtained from the models is in quantitative agreement with n - body and fokker - planck integrators by evolving plummer models with three species of stars and following constant - mass lagrangian radii in time for all three components ( cf .",
    "spitzer & shull 1975 , fig .  1 ) .",
    "spurzem & takahashi ( 1995 ) report excellent agreement from their own two - component test calculations .",
    "the different mass components are evolved according to the cambridge tracks ( pols et al .",
    "1998 ; hurley et al .",
    "the tracks are efficiently coded in the form of fitting functions of the kind first presented by eggleton , tout & fitchett ( 1989 ) .",
    "the functions return the current bolometric luminosity , radius , mass and metal abundance for given time and initial metal abundance @xmath16 ; we set @xmath17 ( solar abundance ) throughout .",
    "a filter can be applied to the bolometric luminosity from model stellar atmospheres , and the total flux in a specified waveband read by interpolation polynomials from the basel stellar library ( lejeune et al .",
    "we have mapped the stellar luminosity near the strongest near - ir co bandhead ( @xmath18 ) and the caii triplet ( @xmath19 ) together with the bolometric limit ( all wavelengths ) . since our results",
    "are not strongly dependent on waveband issues , we will discuss only quantities computed from bolometric fluxes .",
    "all models were scaled to @xmath20 member stars and a total mass of @xmath21 when an salpeter mass function is implemented .",
    "this is significantly less than what is measured for massive clusters in starburst galaxies , where membership may well exceed @xmath22 .",
    "this point is important because the time - scale for segregation scales with @xmath23 .",
    "however we may explore the importance of varying the dynamical evolution time by constructing models with different sizes and central densities , while keeping the total mass , and @xmath24 , constant .",
    "this approach is attractive because two systems with the same mean density will have the same dynamical time @xmath25 , independently of their mass and size .",
    "we first setup three models with identical @xmath26 king parameter but each with different half - light radius .",
    "the model labeled ` m82-f ' has a mean surface density @xmath27 or half the value we derive for that cluster from the data of smith & gallagher ( 2001 ) .",
    "the densest model is labeled ` r136 ' , in reference to the 30 doradus cluster ( central volume density @xmath28 ; brandl et al .",
    "finally , a third low - density model was evolved for comparison ( labeled ` low ' ) .",
    "we start with the densest model ` r136 ' for which we compute the shortest relaxation time @xmath29 . since @xmath30 and @xmath31 are all known from the simulations , we solve for @xmath0 directly from ( [ eq : eta ] ) .",
    "the run of @xmath0 in time is displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : etavstime ] .",
    "the rapid increase of @xmath0 from an initial value @xmath32 is striking . after 15 myr of evolution , @xmath0 has more than doubled .",
    "the projected half - light radius @xmath9 is displayed alongside @xmath0 .",
    "the radius @xmath9 decreases steadily in time , a direct result of the migration of massive stars toward the centre .",
    "note the slow but systematic rise of @xmath0 after @xmath33 myr , when @xmath34 ( factor @xmath35 2.5 from its initial value .",
    "the results are robust and can be extended to other stellar imf ( fleck et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the time - evolution of @xmath0 for all three models is displayed on fig .  1 . both @xmath0 and @xmath9 for the ` low ' model",
    "stay essentially constant throughout .",
    "however the case ` m82-f ' ( initial surface density @xmath36 ) shows unmistakable evolution , suggesting that for clusters of such or higher mean surface density we may no longer presume a time - independent mass - to - light parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this has to be interpreted with care since unresolved , bright clusters will be more massive than the ones modelled here ; despite this caveat , evolution will always take place in the central regions where the density peaks .",
    "this has immediate bearing on fitting cluster light profiles .",
    "the losvd changes relatively little over time in comparison : we measure a monotonic decrease of @xmath37 from @xmath38 to 9.3 km / s ( or , -10.6% ) for the system as a whole , although for individual components evolution was more significant : down @xmath39 for the most massive stars , while the lightest component enjoys an increase of a comparable magnitude .",
    "these effects can all be traced back to the dynamical mass segregation .      in this section",
    "we ask what effect the background galactic potential may have on the formation and early evolution of a star cluster .",
    "more specifically , we ask whether the tidal field is an ingredient that matters when it comes to understanding cluster formation in mergers .",
    "the results reported here are taken from a doctoral dissertation by fleck ( 2007 ) .",
    "we built two equal mass bulge / disk / halo galaxy models to simulate an antenn - like major merger with initial conditions similar to barnes s ( 1988 ) .",
    "we set up self - gravitating models using the magalie software included with the nemo stellar dynamical package ( version 3.2.4 ; teuben 1995 ) .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated with gyrfalcon ( dehnen 2002 ) using a plummer softening kernel with @xmath40 in units where the gravitational constant @xmath41 and a numerical unit of time translates to 25 myr .",
    "the total mass of each galaxy is equal to @xmath42 mass units , where the exponential disk scale - length and mass @xmath43 .",
    "the bulge is an hernquist ( 1990 ) model with a scale parameter @xmath44 and total mass @xmath45 .",
    "thus our progenitor galaxies are `` s0 '' galaxies with relatively warm toomre @xmath46 disk parameter to ensure local stability to fragmentation modes .",
    "note that our model galaxies differ mostly from barnes s in that he used a lighter king ( 1966 ) model for the bulge .",
    "the dark matter halo was generated from a truncated isothermal distribution as described in hernquist ( 1993 ) .",
    "the mass ratio between individual particles @xmath47 to minimize two - body heating ; a total of @xmath48 particles were used for each galaxy , for a mass resolution of @xmath49 for the different components . converted to physical units , the simulations matched well the kinematics of the antenn ( peak systemic velocity of 130 km / s ) but for a total baryonic mass of @xmath50 , some twice that measured for that system ( cf .",
    "hibbard et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the galaxies were set on a prograde encounter with tidal tails developing on either side of the orbital plane , implying non - coplanar disks .",
    "v.17 of fleck ( 2007 , p.154 ) shows the orbit of the centers of mass of the two galaxies together with the orbit of the associated point - mass problem initially on a bound but eccentric orbit .",
    "the extent and mass of the dark matter halos are such that the galaxies are braking after the first passage ( @xmath51 ) before falling back together and merging .",
    "tidal tails form soon after the first passage and continue to expand until the end of the simulation at @xmath52 ( for a graphical time - sequence , see fleck 2007 , fig .",
    "iv.9 , p.123 ) .",
    "our mass resolution of @xmath53 implies that individual disk and bulge particles represent cluster - size star forming regions , which we follow on their orbit . to explore a full range of formation histories",
    ", we chose several orbits that ended up either in the tails or remained close of the nuclear region at the end of the simulation .",
    "we retrieved the tidal tensor at the particle position using a second order finite difference scheme from the forces at six points distributed on a box of radius @xmath54 ( @xmath55 pc ) .",
    "the forces were directly summed over all the particles .",
    "we then computed the eigenvalues @xmath56 of the tidal tensor using the fortran routines of kopp ( 2008 ) and looked for regions that undergo purely compressive modes @xmath57 . on figure",
    "[ fig : individual : orbit ] , we graph a selection of orbits and their maximum eigenvalue as a function of time . note that the orbit going back into the nuclei ( dot - dashed line ) experiences the strongest tidal force especially near the second passage , at and around time @xmath58 .",
    "nevertheless , this orbit also experienced a fully compressive mode for a cumulative time interval of one unit .",
    "the orbit which spends the longest total period in a compressive mode ( @xmath59 8 time units , or @xmath60 myr , solid line ) is the one staying closest to the nuclei after a short trek in the tidal arms",
    ". the other two orbits also experience compressive modes immediately after the first passage , between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "fig .  1 of mengel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shows that young massive clusters are dispatched throughout the region surrounding the tidal bridge linking the two nuclei . to determine whether the distribution in space of young clusters may coincide with the compressive modes in the current - day configuration , we isolated a series of bodies that ended in the overlap region of the merger simulation and found that in several instances the bodies were still embedded in a volume of compressive tidal forces .",
    "altogether we find that the fraction of bodies experiencing a compressive tidal field during the simulation rises from @xmath63 in the initial configurations at rest , to @xmath64 during both the first and second passage .",
    "it is clear from the statistics that tidal fields help push in and hold together the material that soon will burst to form a large ensemble of clusters ( renaud et al .",
    "this gathering of mass has long been evoked as a possible mechanism of dwarf galaxy formation with gas dissipation ( e.g. , bournaud et al .",
    "2006 ) . here",
    "we see that the same mechanism is operative at the very heart of a galaxy merger on scales that match those of rich star formation regions .",
