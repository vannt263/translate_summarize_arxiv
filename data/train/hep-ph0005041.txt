    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are believed to be the most plausible candidate for dark matter ( dm ) in the universe .",
    "wimps are predicted to exist in many extensions of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "most of the well - motivated wimp candidates are majorana ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath0 ) fermions .",
    "this in particular is often the case in models based on supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "perhaps the most popular wimp candidate is the lightest neutralino , a superposition of the susy partners of the electroweak gauge bosons ( gauginos ) and higgs particles ( higgsinos ) .",
    "other plausible wimp candidates for cold dm ( cdm ) , the axino and gravitino ( fermionic susy partners of the axion and graviton , respectively ) are also majorana particles .    in the case of non - relativistic majorana wimps ,",
    "their predicted elastic scattering couplings to atomic nuclei are effectively of two types  @xcite . in scalar , or spin - independent ( si ) interactions",
    "the wimp coupling is proportional to the mass of the nucleus . in the axial , or spin - dependent",
    "( sd ) case , the coupling is proportional to the spin of the nucleus .",
    "direct searches for galactic halo wimps through their elastic scattering off target nuclei are currently being carried out by several groups . in the absence of a positive signal",
    "it is the aim of these experiments to set limits on the properties of wimp dark matter independently of its precise composition .",
    "this is accomplished by setting limits on the cross sections for si and sd interactions between wimps and target nuclei as functions of wimp mass . to enable comparison with results from other experiments ( which may use different target nuclei )",
    "one often translates these limits to bounds on the wimp - proton cross section .",
    "the current procedure used for the conversion is relatively straightforward in the case of si interactions but becomes problematic in the case of sd interactions .",
    "the reason for this is that limits on spin - dependent wimp - proton scattering cross sections contain considerable dependence on a particular wimp composition ( _ e.g. _ , gaugino - like versus higgsino - like neutralino wimp )",
    ". since the spin of target nuclei is carried both by constituent protons and neutrons , when converting to a wimp - proton cross section a value for the ratio of the wimp - proton and wimp - neutron cross sections must be assumed .",
    "but in many cases this ratio can vary significantly depending on the assumed type of wimp . in the particular case of a predominantly gaugino neutralino wimp",
    "this ratio varies by several orders of magnitude  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "current experimental limits on the wimp - proton cross section for sd interactions are fraught with potentially significant wimp - type dependence .    in this letter",
    ", we introduce an alternative method for deriving limits on spin - dependent wimp - nucleon interactions .",
    "this new procedure allows one to extract experimental limits in a ( majorana ) wimp - model independent way .",
    "first , in sec .  2 , we briefly summarise the current practice .",
    "the new method is presented in sec .",
    "3 and its features are discussed in sec .",
    "the current procedure for calculating spin - dependent wimp - nucleon cross section limits from experimental data can be summarised as follows ( following refs .",
    "assume a detector consists of some species of nucleus , @xmath1 .",
    "using the convention of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see eqn .  ( 7.13 ) ) , the total wimp - nucleus cross section @xmath2 can be written as @xmath3 where the wimp - target reduced mass @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 for wimp mass @xmath6 and target nucleus mass @xmath7 . the `` enhancement factor '' @xmath8",
    "is given in eqns .",
    "( 7.14 ) and  ( 7.35 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for sd and si interactions , respectively , and will also be given explicitly below .",
    "as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath2 ( called there @xmath9 ) is , strictly speaking , _ not _ the total cross section .",
    "it is , by definition , the `` standard '' total wimp - nucleus cross section at zero momentum transfer .",
    "however , it is the quantity that is conventionally used by experimental groups for setting limits and we will continue calling it here the total wimp - nucleus cross section .    in the first step , the data is used to calculate limits @xmath10 on the si and sd wimp - nucleus cross sections .",
    "( if the target is made of several species of nuclei ( _ e.g. _ , na and i ) , the procedure is performed for each species separately and next the limits are combined together . ) in each case it is assumed that only the given type of interaction ( sd or si ) dominates the total cross section .",
    "the wimp - target cross section limit @xmath10 obtained for target @xmath11 can be expressed in terms of limits on wimp - nucleon ( _ i.e. _  _ free _ proton or neutron ) cross sections @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is defined by setting @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) in the expression for the reduced mass @xmath4 above , and similarly for @xmath18 ( see also below ) .",
    "this conversion is made conventionally to the wimp - proton cross section limit using the former expression .",
    "the purpose of this conversion is twofold .",
    "it allows one to compare limits derived by different experiments which use different target materials .",
    "second , theoretical calculations in specific ( _ e.g. _ , susy ) models give predictions for @xmath19 ( and @xmath20 ) which can be next directly compared with experimental results .    in the si case",
    "the conversion is straightforward .",
    "this is because now the enhancement factor is proportional to the square of the atomic number , @xmath21 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the effective wimp couplings to protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "for majorana wimps @xmath24 and so one typically has @xmath25 and the conversion does not depend on the specific wimp type . for massive dirac neutrino - like wimps",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 and again the conversion does not depend on the wimp model or its parameters .",
    "in the sd case however the situation is more complex . here",
    "the enhancement factor as defined here ( and in ref .",
    "@xcite ) differs slightly from a similar quantity @xmath28 used in refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath29 . ] is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are ( wimp - type dependent ) effective wimp - proton and wimp - neutron couplings and @xmath33 are the expectation values of the proton and neutron spins within the nucleus and @xmath34 is the total nuclear spin . in the particular case of free nucleons",
    "one finds @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 has been used .",
    "this definition of @xmath8 normalises the spin - dependent nuclear form - factor @xmath38 used in calculating nuclear recoil energy spectra to unity at @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 here the @xmath42 are the respective isoscalar , isovector and interference term form - factors for nucleus @xmath43 ( assumed to be known from nuclear calculations ) and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are isoscalar and isovector coefficients . using this definition most of the wimp model - dependencies in @xmath46",
    "are absorbed into @xmath8 , leaving @xmath38 and hence the shape of recoil energy spectra relatively model - independent .",
    "recent calculations  @xcite have shown that @xmath38 still contains some residual model - dependencies owing to differences in the @xmath47-dependence of the @xmath42 form - factors .",
    "these differences are however small for most nuclei of interest , including na , i and f  @xcite , and will henceforth be neglected .",
    "it is clear from eqn .",
    "( [ eq0.1c ] ) that , in the sd case , converting wimp - target cross section limits @xmath10 to the wimp - proton cross section @xmath12 becomes problematic .",
    "this is because the enhancement factor @xmath8 now receives contributions from both proton and neutron terms . as we will argue below , due to the presence of wimp - dependent coefficients",
    "@xmath48 , both of these contributions can be of comparable order and even of opposite sign . as a result , the ratio @xmath49 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) , and hence the derived limit @xmath12 will depend on the assumed type of wimp .    in the early ( single - particle or odd - group model ) calculations",
    "the nuclear spin was always assumed to be dominated either by the proton or by the neutron term in eqn .",
    "( [ eq0.1c ] ) .",
    "thus when dealing with odd - proton targets , such as na or i , the @xmath50 in the expression for @xmath8 was conveniently cancelled by the @xmath50 in the analogous expression for the wimp - proton cross section enhancement factor @xmath51 .",
    "model dependencies were thus eliminated .",
    "the conversion is however complicated when dealing with odd - neutron targets because of the factor @xmath52 remaining in the expression for @xmath12 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) .",
    "this ratio is not guaranteed to be constant and in general is wimp model - dependent . in the important case of susy neutralino wimps early estimates of the @xmath53 values used in calculating @xmath31 and @xmath32 were nevertheless such that the ratio @xmath54 was always of order unity , independent of the neutralino composition .",
    "later estimates of @xmath53  @xcite have however shown that although this is still true for predominantly higgsino neutralinos , the ratio for gaugino neutralinos is highly susy model - dependent and can vary by several orders of magnitude ( as demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] for models from the database described in refs .",
    "gaugino - like neutralinos as dm wimps are strongly favoured by a combination of naturalness and cosmological arguments  @xcite in which case this problem becomes particularly acute .",
    "a still further problem arises when using more recent shell - model calculations for @xmath55 and @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "these indicate non - zero contributions to the nuclear spin from _ both _ protons _ and _ neutrons , and in this case the @xmath50 factor can not be cancelled from even odd - proton nuclei .",
    "hence even if one of these contributions is larger than the other , as is often the case , then the wimp - dependent ratio of @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be such that both contributions to the cross section are substantial .",
    "furthermore , @xmath57 and @xmath58 can in general be of opposite sign and similar magnitude .",
    "hence , a more proper way of writing the enhancement factor would be @xmath59 in general therefore , depending on the particular wimp type , the wimp - target cross section can be considerably reduced relative to that of its constituent nucleons . in these circumstances limits set by assuming the simple case of higgsino neutralino or heavy neutrino wimps ( constant @xmath60 ) would prove to be unduly optimistic .",
    "we will now present a new method for deriving limits on spin - dependent wimp - nucleon interactions .",
    "the method will be free from the problems described above and will allow one to derive experimental limits in a way which is independent of the type of the assumed ( majorana ) wimp .",
    "we will start by identifying the separate proton and neutron contributions to the total enhancement factor @xmath8 @xmath61 in light of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : iapm ] ) , this gives @xmath62 .",
    "following eqns .",
    "( [ eq00 ] ) and  ( [ eq0.1c ] ) we thus define the proton and neutron contributions @xmath63 and @xmath64 to the total cross section @xmath2 as : @xmath65 using eqns .",
    "( [ eq00 ] ) , ( [ eq : iapm ] ) and ( [ eq9 - 1 ] ) , one can express @xmath2 as @xmath66    we note that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are _ not _ measured cross sections .",
    "they are nevertheless convenient auxiliary quantities which identify separate proton and neutron contributions to the total cross section @xmath2",
    ".    we will now proceed as follows .",
    "( see the appendix for a more rigorous treatment . )",
    "we will first make an auxiliary assumption that @xmath67 .",
    "in other words , we assume that the total wimp - nucleus cross section is dominated by the proton contribution only .",
    "we then _ define _ the wimp - proton cross section limit @xmath12 corresponding to the wimp - target @xmath11 cross section limit @xmath10 as @xmath68 analogously , the wimp - neutron cross section limit @xmath13 is defined by assuming that @xmath69 and writing @xmath70    it is clear that the use of the ratios @xmath71 and @xmath72 ensures the cancellation of the wimp - dependent @xmath50 and @xmath73 terms contained within the wimp - target cross section @xmath2 and hence ensures wimp model - independence .",
    "values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 for typical nuclei of interest obtained using data from refs .",
    "@xcite are listed in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "these properties can now be used in expressing wimp - independent experimental limits on the wimp - nucleus sd interaction cross section @xmath10 in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath20 which are the quantities whose values are predicted by specific theoretical models . if an experiment publishes the limits @xmath12 and @xmath13 then eqn .  (",
    "[ eq9 - 2 ] ) can be used to define a wimp - independent excluded region in the @xmath19 - @xmath20 plane as @xmath76    because of relative sign ambiguity , the condition  ( [ eq5 ] ) implies two bounds corresponding to constructive and destructive interference .",
    "a conservative limit corresponds to the relative minus sign which reduces the overall wimp - target cross section .",
    "we note , however , that in comparing with a specific theoretical ( e.g. susy ) model there will be no sign ambiguity : the theoretical model predicts not only @xmath19 and @xmath20 but also the signs of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in this case",
    "the sign in eqn .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is known and is given by the sign of @xmath77 .",
    "an alternative way of expressing the limits in this procedure is to consider exclusion regions directly in terms of the fundamental wimp - nucleon coupling coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in this case",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is replaced by @xmath78 where we applied eqn .",
    "( [ eq00 ] ) to the case of the nucleons to obtain @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the small proton - neutron mass difference has been ignored .",
    "the variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 can have either sign , and the relative sign inside the square is now determined by the sign of @xmath81 only . eqn .",
    "( [ eq5a ] ) corresponds geometrically in the @xmath31 - @xmath32 plane to excluding a region exterior to two parallel lines whose slope has opposite sign to @xmath82 .",

    "this region extends to infinity in both directions .",
    "so far , we have presented the method for one species of target nucleus only .",
    "a generalisation to two or more nuclei in the same target is straightforward .",
    "analogously to the wimp - proton cross section limit in the current method  @xcite , the limits @xmath83 and @xmath84 from different nuclei @xmath85 in the target @xmath11 can be combined by using @xmath86    it should be noted that when calculating the combined excluded region in @xmath19 - @xmath20 parameter space for two or more nuclei in the same target material it would be incorrect to use eqn .",

    "the correct approach is to use instead the generalisation of eqn .",

    "the allowed region would then lie inside the intersection of the two bands of opposite slope .    as a practical illustration , we consider limits from a synthetic data set ( assumed to be from a nai detector ) using both the current and the proposed techniques .",
    "the data set consists of recoil energy dependent event rate limits which have been converted to wimp mass dependent target nucleus cross section limits using nuclear kinematics and eqn .  ( [ eq0.2 ] ) as described in ref .",

    "we do this for three different neutralino wimp compositions ( _ i.e. _  different ratios @xmath89 from fig .  [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "this results in overall ( combined na and i ) limits @xmath90 which , for a given wimp mass but different type , can be different by almost two orders of magnitude : a thick solid curve corresponds to the limit for the higgsino wimp ( @xmath91 ) , which is currently commonly assumed , while the two thick dash - dotted lines correspond to the two gaugino wimp cases giving the extremal limits for wimps of mass 100 gev / c@xmath92 .",
    "these two curves illustrate the considerable effects of destructive ( upper curve ) and constructive ( lower curve ) interference between proton and neutron contributions to the nuclear spin .",

    "we plot the limits @xmath12 and @xmath13 calculated using eqns .",
    "( [ eq4.-1p ] ) - ( [ eq4.-1n ] ) and hence avoiding the assumption of a specific wimp composition .",
    "we can clearly see that the limits in windows ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) differ considerably .",
    "in all the cases at small wimp masses the best limits are provided by na due to its slowly - varying form - factor @xmath38 .",
    "however , at larger masses iodine provides a better limit due to its larger value for @xmath74 ( table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the spin of both nuclei is carried predominantly by protons and so for this target the limits @xmath12 are in general superior to @xmath13 .",
    "the individual limits @xmath12 and @xmath13 presented in figs .",

    ", this alternative method effectively uses both the wimp - proton and wimp - neutron cross sections @xmath19 _ and _ @xmath20 .",
    "this ensures that the wimp - model dependence of the experimental sd cross section limits is removed .",
    "the method applies to targets with one or more species of nuclei in the target and allows unambiguous comparisons with theoretical predictions .",
    "in contrast to the currently used procedure , the new technique makes it possible for a given experiment to set limits on the spin - dependent wimp - nucleon cross section in a wimp - independent way .",
    "another significant advantage of the new technique is that it makes the direct comparison of experimental results with theoretical predictions possible .",
    "given the wimp - proton and wimp - neutron exclusion plots from a particular experiment , one can determine whether a specific choice of parameters is allowed or excluded for a given wimp mass simply by using eqn .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "in fact , all the information needed to allow or exclude any wimp candidate ( like susy neutralino wimps with arbitrary composition , non - susy heavy neutrino , etc . ) can be presented in only three figures ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 1](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 1](c ) plus one si cross section limit plot ) .",
    "no additional plots similar to fig .  [ fig1 ] need be drawn to determine the exclusion region for a particular wimp mass .",
    "it is not surprising that dark matter experiments using odd - proton targets will generally give very good wimp - proton cross section limits and rather weak wimp - neutron cross section limits for the same wimp - target cross section limits .",
    "just the opposite will be true with experiments using odd - neutron targets .",
    "this is what one should in fact expect : odd - proton and odd - neutron targets are effectively measuring two quite different and unrelated quantities ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "it is only in the particular case of higgsino neutralino and heavy neutrino wimps  @xcite that the limits from such targets calculated using the new technique are still comparable , by using a constant value for @xmath91 to combine @xmath12 and @xmath13 into a single limit on the wimp - proton cross section .",
    "these limits are equivalent to those obtained using the current technique ( _ i.e. _  fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 1](a ) ) . in any case",
    ", experiments may find it useful to publish such limits in addition to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 limit curves calculated using the new technique ( _ i.e. _  fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 1](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 1](c ) ) .    in the event of a discovery of spin - dependent wimp - nucleon interactions it is likely that a different procedure from that described above would be required to analyse the data .",
    "in this case a fit would likely be performed to the observed nuclear recoil energy spectrum , with parameters such as the wimp mass and cross sections on each target nucleus being considered to be free .",
    "this would in turn define an allowed region in @xmath19 - @xmath20 parameter space for each allowed wimp mass and it would be this region which could be compared with theoretical predictions .    in conclusion ,",
    "a new technique has been presented for deriving spin - dependent wimp - nucleon cross section limits from direct detection dark matter experiments .",
    "this technique retains the attractive features of the current procedure , including the ability to combine limits from individual target nuclei .",
    "the new technique , however , has the additional advantage of allowing the calculation of wimp - nucleon spin dependent cross section limits in a wimp - independent manner and of making it possible to compare experimental results with theoretical predictions .",
    "here we present the basic formalism behind the alternative method presented in sec .  3 .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we will include here some expressions given already there .",
