    "as @xmath82 decreases , dirac cones get closer to the merging point and the interlayer conductivity is reduced .",
    "we do not claim that our calculations provide a continuous description of the dirac point motion from the zero gap to the gaped phase .",
    "but one could notice that there is a sign change of the magnetoresistance , for a normal field ( @xmath169 , if the system moves from the independent dirac valleys to the merging phase . in the former case , @xmath71 is linear to @xmath50 whereas in the latter case @xmath71 decreases with increasing @xmath50 .",
    "to obtain a continuous analytical description of the magnetotransport with the dirac point motion , one need to derive the expression of the eigenfunctions of the anharmonic quartic oscillator with the potential given by eq.[v(y ) ] . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "these eigenfunctions have not been analytically determined .",
    "et al._@xcite found solutions for the schrdinger equation corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath170 where @xmath171 with the condition @xmath172 .",
    "the solution is of the form : @xmath173 however , @xmath174 diverges for @xmath175 .",
    "+ in fig.[figsigmab ] we present the field dependence of the interlayer conductivity @xmath71 in the presence of an inplane field component .",
    "@xmath71 shows a positive magnetoresistance as a function of the field amplitude .",
    "+        figures [ figsigma - teta ] and [ figsigma - phi ] show the field orientation dependence of the interlayer conductivity at the merging .     at the merging of dirac points . ]     for a fixed field amplitude at the merging of dirac points . ]",
    "according to figure [ figsigma - phi ] the interlayer conductivity @xmath71 shows a maximum along the strain direction @xmath10 ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "this behavior is found to be independent of the out - of - plane angle @xmath5 as in the case where dirac cones are far from the merging ( fig.[figphi ] ) .",
    "+ however , the dependence of @xmath71 on the out of plane angle @xmath5 is different from that found far from the merging .",
    "the maximum of the conductivity is no more for a transverse magnetic field ( @xmath177 ) , as in fig.[figtheta ] , but is shifted towards @xmath102 as the inplane field component @xmath90 is turned along the strain direction @xmath10 .",
    "this behavior could be taken as an experimental probe for the merging of dirac cones .",
    "we have derived the expression of the interlayer magnetoresistance in a multilayer deformed dirac electron system . we have discussed the signature of the motion and the merging of dirac cones induced by the deformation . in the case of independent dirac valleys ,",
    "the system shows a negative magnetoresistance for a normal magnetic field as in undeformed case .",
    "however , a crossover from a negative to a positive magnetoresistance could take place in the presence of an inplane field component .",
    "the latter induces an inplane lorentz force which reduces the interlayer tunneling .",
    "this effect is more pronounced as the amplitude of the deformation is increased .",
    "the motion of dirac cones , resulting from the deformation , gives rise to a dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance on the azimuthal angle .",
    "however , the behavior of the interlayer resistance with the out - of - plane angle @xmath5 is unchanged compared to the undeformed case . we have argued that the sign change of the magnetoresistance could also result from a coupling between dirac valleys which removes the degeneracy of the landau level and , hence , reduces the density of carriers .",
    "this coupling is enhanced as the merging is approached or at high magnetic field .",
    "a criterion is proposed to define the range of validity of the independent dirac valleys assumption .",
    "these features may be observed in @xmath1-(bedt)@xmath2i@xmath3 under high pressure or in a stack of deformed graphene like systems .",
