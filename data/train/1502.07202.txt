    "a _ translation surface _ is the data @xmath4 of a compact riemann surface @xmath5 of genus @xmath6 and a non - zero abelian differential ( holomorphic @xmath7-form ) @xmath8 on @xmath5 .",
    "the moduli spaces of translation surfaces possess a natural @xmath9-action whose dynamical features play a key role in some applications to dynamical systems and algebraic geometry such as the study of interval exchange transformations and translation flows , and the classification of commensurability classes of ball quotients introduced by deligne and mostow .",
    "see , for example , the works of masur @xcite , veech @xcite , zorich @xcite , forni @xcite , delecroix - hubert - lelivre @xcite , athreya - eskin - zorich @xcite , and kappes - mller @xcite for some illustrations .",
    "a major actor in the investigation of the dynamics of the @xmath9-action on moduli spaces of translation surfaces is the so - called kontsevich - zorich cocycle ( kz cocycle for short ) : for instance , the properties of the kz cocycle are a crucial ingredient in the celebrated recent work of eskin - mirzakhani @xcite towards the classification of @xmath9-invariant measures on moduli spaces of translation surfaces .",
    "a detailed study of the kz cocycle was initiated by forni @xcite .",
    "these works are concerned with formulas for exponents , spectral gap and non - triviality of exponents , as well as applications to dynamics on translation surfaces .",
    "later , in @xcite it was proved that the kz cocycle is semisimple and its decomposition respects the hodge structure . using this property , in @xcite , an analysis of possible groups appearing in the zariski closure of the monodromy ( or the algebraic hull )",
    "up to finite index and compact factors , the list of groups and representations is :    * @xmath10 in the standard representation ; * @xmath11 in the standard representation ; * @xmath12 in an exterior power representation ; * @xmath2 in the standard representation ( see @xcite and for a description ) ; * @xmath13 in a spin representation .    in other words , this list of five representations",
    "_ suffices _ to account for all possibilities for the monodromy group of the kz cocycle .",
    "nevertheless , our understanding of the kz cocycle is not completely satisfactory yet : for instance , while the monodromy groups in items ( i ) and ( ii ) above appear in several families of examples in the literature ( see , e.g. , eskin , kontsevich , and zorich @xcite and mcmullen @xcite ) , question 5.5 of @xcite asks whether the monodromy groups in items ( iii ) , ( iv ) and ( v ) _ actually _ occur in the context of the kz cocycle .",
    "it is known that each item of this list can be realized _ abstractly _ as monodromy group of variations of hodge structures over certain families of riemann surfaces and abelian varieties ( see @xcite for more explanations ) .",
    "however , it is not clear how to convert these abstract realizations into non - compact factors of the kz cocycle over the closure of some @xmath9-orbit in the moduli space of translation surfaces . ]    in this note , we give the following partial answer to this question .",
    "[ t.ffm ] there exists an origami @xmath14 of genus @xmath15 such that the restriction of the kz cocycle over @xmath16 to a certain @xmath9-irreducible piece of the corresponding semisimple decomposition acts ( modulo finite - index subgroups ) through a zariski dense subgroup of @xmath0 in its standard representation .",
    "this result says that a particular case of item ( iv ) above occurs for the kz cocycle over the @xmath9-action on moduli spaces of translation surfaces .",
    "in fact , we have an exceptional isomorphism of real lie algebras @xmath17 .",
    "this can be seen , for instance , by comparing the satake diagrams in the back of @xcite .    moreover , letting @xmath18 act in its standard representation identifies it with @xmath19 acting in the second exterior power of its standard representation .",
    "the underlying vector space is @xmath20 viewed as @xmath21 .    in particular , up to finite center ,",
    "the groups @xmath0 and @xmath1 are isomorphic .",
    "this means that the example from is , in fact , also an example of @xmath1 acting in its second exterior power ( thus , of item ( iii ) in the list above ) .    in principle , the computations from as well as the discussion in suggest how to find further examples of pieces of the monodromy in @xmath2 for any @xmath3 .",
    "namely , one can first look for quarternionic representations occurring in the cohomology of some regular origami ( or more general family of translation surfaces with symmetries ) .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath3 of the representation will constrain the monodromy to lie inside @xmath2 .",
    "one then has to check that the monodromy is irreducible , i.e. that the cocycle does not split further .",
    "note that the computations of matheus , yoccoz , and zmiaikou @xcite give rise to a large number of explicit examples .",
    "on the other hand , the question of finding examples of @xmath9-orbits in moduli spaces of translation surfaces whose associated kz cocycles have monodromy groups with non - compact factors realizing all cases in items ( iii ) or ( v ) seems more challenging in our opinion ( cf . ) .",
    "regarding the multiplicities of representations for the cohomology of regular origamis , we have the next result .",
    "let @xmath22 be a regular origami , determined by a group @xmath23 and the two generator @xmath24 ( see for definitions ) .",
    "let @xmath25 be their commutator , and let @xmath26 be a complex irreducible representation of @xmath23 . then in the cohomology group @xmath27 , the representation @xmath26 appears ( see ) with multiplicity @xmath28 here @xmath29 is a constant equal to @xmath7 if @xmath26 is trivial and zero otherwise , while @xmath30 denotes the dimension of the vector subspace in @xmath26 fixed by the element @xmath31 .    in the cohomology group @xmath32 , the representation @xmath26 appears ( see ) with multiplicity @xmath33 here @xmath34 denotes the dimension of the space in the representation @xmath26 on which the element @xmath31 acts with eigenvalue @xmath35 , while @xmath36 is the order of @xmath31 in @xmath23 .    for regular origamis ,",

    "an _ origami _ ( or _ square - tiled surface _ ) is a translation surface @xmath41 such that the riemann surface @xmath5 is obtained by a finite covering @xmath42 of the torus @xmath43 which is unramified off @xmath44 , and the ( non - zero ) abelian differential @xmath8 on @xmath5 is the pullback @xmath45 of the abelian differential @xmath46 on @xmath47 .",

    "note that the translation surface @xmath41 associated to a pair of permutations @xmath48 is connected if and only if the group generated by @xmath57 and @xmath58 acts transitively on @xmath49 .",
    "these two definitions of origamis are related as follows .",

    "equivalently , the kz cocycle over @xmath105 acts on @xmath106 via appropriate elements of @xmath97 .    suppose from now on that @xmath41 is an origami and let @xmath42 be the associated finite ramified covering . in this case , the kz cocycle respects the following decomposition into ( @xmath97-invariant ) subspaces defined over @xmath107 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the kernel of @xmath110 , and @xmath111 is the symplectic orthogonal of @xmath109 with respect to the usual ( symplectic ) intersection form .",
