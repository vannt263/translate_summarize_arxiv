    "the evolution of the universe is determined by the complex interplay of a large number of processes that involve the exchange of mass and energy . a global view of these",
    "mass and energy flows has been taken to investigate the universal content of baryonic mass @xcite , energy @xcite , metals @xcite and star formation @xcite .",
    "these quantities give us useful insights in to the evolution of the physical universe as a whole and they help us understand how individual processes contribute to the evolution .    in this work , we aim to investigate a key part of this global energy interchange : radiative cooling of diffuse gas on cosmological scales . in particular , we aim to identify the cooling channels that dominate the energy budget of the diffuse gas that traces the large - scale structure of the universe and that feeds galaxies and fuels star formation through accretion processes . for our purposes",
    ", we define this diffuse matter as the sum of three main components : i ) the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , defined as the low - density gas that is not gravitationally bound to galaxies and their haloes ; ii ) the circum - galactic medium ( cgm ) , which is denser than the igm , resides in the immediate surroundings of galaxies , and is bound to galaxy haloes ; and iii ) the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , which is the hot , shock - heated gas that accumulates in the gravitational potentials of groups and clusters .",
    "both the cgm and the icm are gravitationally bound to haloes and represent the densest fraction of diffuse gas . while the distinctions between these components are often not clear in observations , they can be more cleanly defined in simulations . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will consider gas in simulations as  diffuse \" if its hydrogen number density is @xmath5  @xmath1 .",
    "thermal and kinetic energy are injected in to the diffuse gas by gravity , by galactic winds powered by stellar winds and supernova explosions , and by feedback due to black hole accretion ( agn feedback ) , cosmic rays and other processes .",
    "the gas cools via a variety of mechanisms and emits radiation in a broad range of wavelengths .",
    "the cooling radiation can in turn heat up gas locally or far away , can be absorbed and re - emitted at lower frequencies by dust , or ( if the mean free path of photons is very large ) can contribute to the background radiation field .",
    "cooling processes within galaxies are thought to contribute substantially to the diffuse infrared , optical , uv and x - ray  backgrounds and are an essential ingredient in galaxy formation .",
    "these are still not well understood , but can be somewhat constrained and quantified by observation .",
    "the radiation produced by the cooling of diffuse gas , on the other hand , is very difficult to observe directly because of its very low surface brightness ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "currently , the igm can therefore be more effectively studied in absorption rather than in emission .    in this work , we aim to provide a global view of how cooling occurs in diffuse gas . to this end",
    ", we use a subset of runs from the overwhelmingly large simulations ( owls  hereafter ) project @xcite to address a number of questions concerning the emission and cooling processes of diffuse gas , including : i ) which transitions , ions , and gas phases are responsible for most of the cooling radiation , and should thus be the focus of theoretical modelling efforts ?",
    "ii ) which wavebands and emission lines carry most of the energy emitted by diffuse gas through cooling and fluorescence radiation , and should thus be primary targets for observational studies ?",
    "iii ) what is the relative importance of continuum emission and line emission ?",
    "iv ) what is the global emission of diffuse gas , and how does it change with time ?",
    "how much energy is stored in the igm ?",
    "since our focus is diffuse gas , we will ignore emission by dust and by gas with densities exceeding @xmath6  @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ tables ] describes the emissivity tables used to calculate the gas emission and shows the dependence of the emissivity on temperature for a large sample of ions , individual emission lines and the continuum .",
    "section  [ owlproj ] discusses the simulations and the methodology used to calculate the gas emission .",
    "section  [ volume ] presents results for the fraction of energy emitted by different ions , elements and the continuum in the reference simulation set ( _ ref _  in the following ) at @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in section [ sims ]",
    "we compare results from different simulations to understand the effect of varying the physical prescriptions .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section  [ conclusion ] and present a series of numerical convergence tests in the appendix .",
    ".adopted solar abundances , from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this appendix we provide the full lists of the individual emission lines that contribute most of the cooling energy .",
