    "the apparent mutual exclusion of ferroelectricity and magnetism in abo@xmath0 perovskite oxides has both fascinated and puzzled researchers in the field of multiferroics for decades @xcite .",
    "it is generally known that the presence of @xmath7-electrons at the b - site cation , which is a requirement for magnetism , reduces or removes the tendency for noncentrosymmetric distortions of the bo@xmath19 octahedra , a phenomenon which has been dubbed the  @xmath1 rule \" .",
    "while there has been much progress in this field , the observed mutual exclusion between ferroelectricity and magnetism remains to be fully understood @xcite .",
    "perovskite oxides undergo various symmetry lowering distortions which decrease the total energy of the system . in the case of a ferroelectric material ,",
    "the noncentrosymmetric distortions of bo@xmath19 octahedra leads to breaking of inversion symmetry and a net macroscopic electric polarization @xcite .",
    "it is more common , however , for abo@xmath0 perovskites to undergo centrosymmetric distortions involving the tilting and rotation of bo@xmath19 octahedra @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that competition with such centrosymmetric distortions precipitates the ferroelectric @xmath1 rule @xcite .",
    "ferroelectricity in perovskite oxides can have different origins , e.g. , from canted spins in frustrated magnets @xcite , or from size and electrostatic effects in the hexagonal phase @xcite ; however , in this work , by using the term ferroelectricity we are implicitly referring to `` proper '' ferroelectricity . here , @xmath18 covalent bonding between the b - cation @xmath7 states and surrounding o @xmath6 states can stabilize the ferroelectric phase , which is characterized by a shift of the b - cation sublattice with respect to that of the surrounding o ions @xcite . examples of proper ferroelectrics include the classic cases of batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 , where the ti@xmath20 ion does indeed have a @xmath1 electron configuration , and therefore both batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 are non - magnetic ferroelectric perovskites , consistent with the @xmath1 rule @xcite .",
    "it has recently , however , been pointed out by bersuker @xcite , that certain @xmath21 ( @xmath22 @xmath23 0 ) magnetic cations should be unstable against a pseudo jahn - teller ( pjt ) driven ferroelectric distortion .",
    "this proposition suggests that there exists no fundamental explanation for the ferroelectric @xmath1 rule within the pjt theory for ferroelectricity , although an examination of experimental results suggests , at least empirically , that magnetic b - cations ( almost ) never exhibit proper ferroelectricity .",
    "nevertheless , currently there is a strong research effort focused on the design of magnetoelectric multiferroics , as the coupling of ferroelectricity and magnetism within a single phase material promises novel and exciting opportunities for future spintronic devices @xcite .",
    "the perovskite oxide bicoo@xmath0 has been shown to exhibit a tetragonal ferroelectric phase as the ground state ( i.e. , isostructural with pbtio@xmath0 ) @xcite . at the same time , the @xmath2 co@xmath3 ion is in the high spin state , with @xmath4-type antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "this system is therefore a rare example of a @xmath24 perovskite exhibiting proper ferroelectricity , and represents an opportunity to to investigate the interaction of ferroelectricity and magnetism in perovskite oxides .",
    "it has been proposed , based on first - principles calculations @xcite , that the ferroelectric phase of bicoo@xmath0 is driven by hybridization of the bi 6@xmath5 states and the o @xmath6 valence band ; however , we recently demonstrated that co@xmath3 ions doped into pbtio@xmath0 exhibit novel ferroelectric and multiferroic effects @xcite , and we therefore propose that the co@xmath3 ion is responsible for the strong ferroelectric distortions exhibited by bicoo@xmath0 @xcite , as well as for the multiferroic effects predicted theoretically @xcite .    at this point , it is clear that more work is needed , both experimental and theoretical , so as to understand novel multiferroic materials such as bicoo@xmath0 , as well as to further elucidate the complex interactions of ferroelectricity and magnetism on a microscopic scale . in this report , the interaction of ferroelectricity and magnetism in abo@xmath0 perovskites is investigated in detail .",
    "it is demonstrated that the presence of @xmath7-electrons at the b - cation does not necessarily rule out a strong ferroelectric distortion ; in fact , in the case of bicoo@xmath0 , the presence of unpaired @xmath7-electrons actually _ drives _ ferroelectricity , rather than inhibits it .",
    "the manuscript is presented as follows : the methodology is described in section  [ sec : methods ] and our results and discussion are presented in section  [ sec : results ] . in section  [ sec : pjte ] , we provide a brief introduction into perovskite ferroelectricity and multiferroicity . section  [ sec : labo3 ] investigates the interaction of ferroelectricity and magnetism via a qualitative trend study for artificial labo@xmath0 perovskites , and in section  [ sec : mfce ] we describe quantitatively the origins of ferroelectricity and multiferroicity for the realistic perovskite bicoo@xmath0 .",

    "we use predominantly the standard implementation hse06 , where the screening length and mixing parameter are fixed to 10   and 0.25 respectively . while the inclusion of 25% hartree - fock in the calculation of the exchange potential gives a highly accurate account of the atomic and electronic structure @xcite , for the calculations in fig .",

    "the phonon frequencies are calculated using the method of finite differences .",
    "as has been previously reported for phonon calculations with dft - vasp @xcite , we find that large values for the displacements are required to obtain reasonable results , and we use displacements of 0.04 in lattice units ; displacements this large are expected to be outside of the linear regime , however we also present the results of total energy calculations and lattice relaxations to confirm the findings of the phonon study .",

    "the key goal of this study is to determine the microscopic origins of the ferroelectric and multiferroic behaviour of bicoo@xmath0 ; however , based on our previous work @xcite , we propose that the co@xmath3 ion drives the lattice instability , rather than ( or in conjunction with ) the bi 6@xmath5 hybridization . to isolate the contribution of the b - cation to the ferroelectric lattice instability in abo@xmath0 perovskites , we perform a trend study of the labo@xmath0 series ( ruling out contributions from bi ) .",

    "for the remainder of this section , we focus on the role of the b - cation in the lattice instability of labo@xmath0 perovskites .    as has been discussed above , perovskites will typically undergo a competing centrosymmetric distortion , rather than a polar one ; this is true across the entire labo@xmath0 series . in table",

    "historically , one of the key ways in which multiferroicity has been studied , is to take a magnetic perovskite like the labo@xmath0 systems presented in table  [ tab : structure ] , and to calculate the ferroelectric lattice instability in the cubic phase , e.g. , by analysis of phonon softening @xcite .",

    "ls splitting is reduced and at about the halfway point of the interpolation , the ls state becomes the ground state ( note that we also performed test calculations for other magnetic configurations of the hs state , and also for the is state to confirm that the ls state becomes the ground state ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : switch ] provides a good first indication for electric field control of magnetism in bicoo@xmath0 , i.e. , changes in the internal polarization strongly affect the relative energies of the hs and ls states ; we propose experimental studies to confirm this magnetoelectric effect .",
