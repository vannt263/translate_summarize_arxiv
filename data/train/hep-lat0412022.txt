    "while the flic overlap and wilson overlap actions are both free of @xmath78 errors ( at both zero and finite quark mass ) , the actions may in general differ at @xmath79 , and as such there may be some difference in their properties at finite @xmath0 .",
    "we conduct a comparison between the two actions by calculating the flic overlap propagator on the same set of quenched ( luscher - weisz ) lattices as in the wilson overlap studies  @xcite .",

    "in particular , the lightest five flic overlap masses are significantly lighter than the corresponding wilson overlap masses . in order to compare the two actions , for each fixed momenta value",
    "we perform a quartic fit of both @xmath8 and @xmath9 as a function of @xmath91 ( excluding the lightest two masses for the flic overlap , so that the lightest bare mass included in the fit is approximately the same for both actions ) . the data and fits for the smallest 10 momenta on each of the lattice are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mqchifit ] for @xmath8 and fig .",
    "[ fig : zqchifit ] for @xmath92    we see that for the curves which correspond to larger @xmath93 the behaviour is essentially linear in the bare mass .",
    "however , for the curves which correspond to smaller @xmath93 we see that at heavy quark masses the behaviour is linear , while at moderate to light quark masses there is an increasing amount of curvature present .",
    "this is consistent with the behaviour of the hadron spectrum predicted by chiral perturbation theory .",
    "however , chiral perturbation theory does not give us a prediction of qcd type quantities such as @xmath94 in this work we used a ( quartic ) polynomial fit function , which would not take into account any non - analytic behaviour that might appear near the chiral limit .",
    "using a reliable formula for the extrapolation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 requires further study , as we must disentangle the effects of finite volume , quenched chiral logs and genuine curvature .",
    "we note at this point that on the @xmath95 lattice the wilson overlap masses change order at large quark mass , an indication that the flic overlap is superior for heavy quarks .    having obtained the fit functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 we then choose @xmath98 gev and compare the functions at these values of the bare mass . in this way we can compare the two actions with matched input masses .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig : wilsonvsflic ] , plotted against the kinematical momenta @xmath74    first we examine the mass function , plotted vs @xmath93 ( as in  @xcite ) .",
    "we see that the actions agree well in the infrared , and are both flat in the ultraviolet . at the lighter quark masses",
    "the two actions agree across the whole momentum spectrum , indicating the renormalisation of the bare mass is similar for the two actions .",
    "this is further supported by comparing the infrared behavior of the mass functions for the two actions at all quark masses .    for the heavier quark masses different asymptotic values of the quark mass are observed .",
    "the difference becomes more pronounced as the quark mass increases .",
    "what this shows is that with a matched input bare mass , the low energy properties of the two lattice actions are the same .",
    "that is , where the lattice approximation is good , the actions agree .",
    "there are well known difficulties associated with putting heavy quarks on the lattice , as the compton wavelength of the quarks becomes small .",
    "it is in this area that we are likely to see sensitivity to the discretisation errors , and this is shown by the data , particularly in the shape of the momentum dependence . in the very infrared the two actions agree for all masses , but at heavy quark mass as the momenta increases they begin to differ , with the coarser lattice showing a more rapid divergence ( as expected ) . given the relatively strange behaviour of the wilson overlap mass function on the coarsest lattice at the heaviest masses , we can conclude that the flic overlap inherits the benefits of the improved ultraviolet behaviour of the flic kernel , due to the ape smearing of the irrelevant operators .",
    "the comparison of the renormalisation function ( which we plot vs @xmath99 ) between the two actions leads to similar conclusions as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wilsonvsflic ] .",
    "two things should be noted however .",
    "the first is that the two actions disagree in the ultraviolet regardless of the quark mass .",
    "this suggests that @xmath9 is more sensitive to the cutoff than @xmath94 secondly , we note that we are comparing @xmath9 and not @xmath88 there is a good reason for this , as by fixing the behaviour of @xmath13 at high momenta and then comparing the two actions , we would have been led to believe ( spuriously ) that the actions agreed in the ultraviolet but not in the infrared .",
    "this also tells us that if we choose @xmath14 in the ultraviolet , then @xmath15 is different for the two actions .    using the same technique",
    ", we can test the scaling of the mass function and renormalisation function .",
    "the results for both the flic overlap and wilson overlap for the three quenched lattices , calculated at @xmath100 gev , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : contlimit ] . examining the flic overlap mass function first",
    ", we see that the scaling is best at light to medium quark mass . at heavy masses",
    "the two finer lattices agree reasonably well , but the coarsest lattice shows scaling violations . at the lighter quark masses the agreement between the lattices is best in the ultraviolet and the very infrared . in the intermediate momentum regime",
    "some difference in @xmath8 between the lattices appears .",
    "the difference seems to increase as the quark mass decreases .",
    "one possible cause for this difference is in finite volume effects , as the @xmath101 lattice had a smaller spatial volume than the @xmath102 lattice .",
    "if the smaller volume resulted in an enhancement of the mass function , then this would explain the difference between the finer lattices at lighter masses , as the lighter quark masses would be more sensitive to the small volume .    the wilson overlap mass function displays similar scaling properties to the flic overlap mass function , but the disagreement between the lattices is in general larger , especially at heavy quark mass .",
    "we note that at the lighter quark masses , the flic overlap shows noticably better scaling between @xmath103 gev , while the wilson overlap has slightly better scaling for @xmath104 gev .",
    "the wilson overlap also appears to scale better in the chiral limit .",
    "this could be due to differing finite volume effects .",
    "another , more likely potential source for the difference is in the chiral fits to the data .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we use a polynomial fit function .",
    "this may be a source of systematic error at light quark mass , as any non - analyticity that might appear in the mass function as we approach the chiral limit would be unaccounted for .",
    "the flic overlap renormalisation function @xmath105 shows agreement between all three lattices in the ultraviolet , but in the infrared there are differences between the three lattices . once again , these differences are largest in the intermediate momentum regime . in the very infrared the disagreement",
    "is somewhat smaller , in particular at the lighter quark masses .",
    "the wilson overlap renormalisation function again shows similar behaviour , but in the intermediate momentum regime the magnitude of the difference is slightly less .",
    "it is somewhat remarkable that for both actions all three lattices agree in the ultraviolet .",
    "the tells us that @xmath15 is essentially independent of @xmath0 ( but does differ between the flic overlap and wilson overlap ) .",
    "we have calculated the quark propagator in momentum space using the flic overlap fermion action in quenched qcd . a comparison with a previous study using the wilson overlap  @xcite indicates that both the mass function @xmath8 and the renormalisation function @xmath105 agree well in the infrared regime .",
    "the comparison was performed using a fitting technique to match the bare quark masses .",
    "the chiral behaviour of @xmath8 and @xmath105 was studied , and clearly demonstrates non - linear behaviour at low momenta and light quark mass , which is consistent with expectations from chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the heavy quark mass behaviour of the flic overlap appears to be better than that of the wilson overlap , as the flic overlap seems to inherit the benefits of smearing the irrelevant operators in the flic kernel .",
    "as one goes to lighter quark masses , @xmath8 for the two actions agree even in the ultraviolet .",
    "the same is not true of @xmath106 as the two actions disagree in the ultraviolet for all masses .",
    "the scaling of the wilson overlap and flic overlap results were also studied .",
    "the two actions showed similar scaling behaviour , with some differences .",
    "the results for @xmath8 showed relatively good scaling across the three lattices at @xmath107 the scaling was best in the ultraviolet and in the very infrared , with some differences appearing in the intermediate momentum regime .",
    "the results at @xmath108 showed clear scaling violations at the heavy quark masses .",
    "overall , for @xmath8 we see that the flic overlap shows superior scaling behaviour at heavy quark mass and in the ultraviolet .",
    "the scaling of the renormalisation function @xmath9 was good in the ultraviolet , but disagreements appeared between the three lattices in the infrared .",
    "given the superior properties of the flic overlap operator outlined above , and the fact that the flic overlap operator is significantly cheaper to invert , we advocate the flic overlap operator as the operator of choice for chiral studies of hadron phenomenology .",
    "future work will explore the effects of dynamical flic fermions  @xcite on the quark propagator  @xcite .",
    "further investigations of the potential effects of finite volumes and the chiral extrapolation function used will also be conducted .",
