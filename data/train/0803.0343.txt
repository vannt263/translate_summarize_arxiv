    "the first proposal of experimental search for @xmath1 violation effects in atoms was made almost 40 years ago @xcite .",
    "the modern advanced experimental techniques realized in the experiments on electron s electric dipole moment ( edm ) are based on that idea and have the sensitivity of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "apart from the electron edm , experimental searches for the edm of the neutron are on - going @xcite .",
    "current sensitivity allows for detection of electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron at the level of @xmath3 @xmath4 . from theoretical point of view",
    ", a non - zero edm could imply non - zero values for the qcd @xmath5-term as the latter can induce an edm @xcite .    an attractive idea to enhance the experimental sensitivity to the electron edm",
    "was proposed in @xcite . in an atom",
    ", the electrons are moving in the electromagnetic field of the nucleus .",
    "if the electron possess an edm , the electric coulomb field of the nucleus would induce a magnetic dipole moment , proportional to the electron edm and the electromagnetic field strength , leading to the magnetization of the sample .",
    "since the electromagnetic field strength inside the nucleus can be several orders of magnitude larger than those achievable in the experiment , the effect of a non - zero electron edm is expected to be magnified .",
    "due to chaotic relative orientation of atoms in a sample , these elementary magnetisations sum up to zero , therefore one would need a polarizing electric field to be applied to the sample , in order to observe the sample magnetization . at the same time , the authors of @xcite indicate that the effect of these atomic @xmath0-odd polarizabilities might interfer with the effect of nuclear edm , and has to be taken into account . if a non - zero neutron edm is discovered in the near future , further tests of our understanding of qcd and fundamental interactions will bring us to the study of the microscopic structure of the @xmath1-violating content of the nucleon , which can be described in terms of @xmath0-odd polarizabilities of the nucleon .",
    "in this paper i address the following questions .",
    "can the presence of these @xmath1-violating structure constants lead to a substancial interference with the measurement of the edm ?",
    "how and whether they can be measured ?",
    "the concept of the polarizabilities was first introduced in classical electrodynamics and characterizes the ability of the elementary charges within a given system to be displaced from their positions in the presence of an external electric field .",
    "the electric dipole moment resulting from such a displacement is proportional to the strength of the applied field , and the coefficient of proportionality is called the ( electric dipole ) polarizability .",
    "this constant quantitatively describes the forces that put the system together .",
    "for instance , the atomic or molecular electric dipole polarizability is known to be of the order of the atom s or molecule s volume @xcite .    instead , the nucleon electric dipole polarizability @xmath6 is only about 1/1000 of its volume , @xmath7 , which characterizes the strong forces that hold the proton together considerably stronger than the electromagnetic forces holding the electron in the atom .",
    "the @xmath0-violating polarizabilities of the nucleon result from two pieces : the short range @xmath0-violating physics ( @xmath0-violation is generated well above the electroweak scale by unknown new physics ) responsible , for instance , for the qcd @xmath5-term , and the ( mostly ) long range pion physics which is quite analogous to the usual compton scattering case .",
    "thus , the natural size of the nucleonic @xmath0-violating polarizabilities is expected to be ^t&~&10 ^ -3g_0fm^3 , where @xmath8 is the strength of the @xmath5-term and @xmath9 denotes a @xmath0-violating nucleon polarizability .",
    "one can compare this to the estimates for the atomic @xmath1-violating polarizability @xmath10 @xcite , & ~&10 ^ -2a.u .",
    ", + & ~&10 ^ -12a.u . , where atomic units were adopted , and @xmath11 is the edm of the neutron .",

    "the effect is quadratic in the photon energy @xmath17 .",
    "although this effect is tiny as compared to the parity - violating contribution , by going to very backward angles this latter is highly suppressed due to the @xmath70 factor in front .",
    "it furthermore has a cubic dependence on the photon energy @xcite .",
    "another important background is represented by the analyzing power of compton scattering .",
    "experimentally , it is impossible to achieve a 100% circular polarization .",
    "the remaining linear polarization component can lead to a similar @xmath0-odd observable that does not require @xmath0-violation , but arises from the final state interaction .",

    "finally , @xmath73 represents the degree of linear polarization , and @xmath34 the analyzing power .",
    "the analyzing power arises as an interference between the purely real leading order compton amplitude ( below the pion threshold ) , and the imaginary part of the next - to - leading order compton amplitude , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compton_an ] . inserting the leading in lex thomson term in place of the blobs in the figure ,",
    "we obtain : = _ em+o(^2 ) where the energy dependent factor is due to the phase space .",
    "the analyzing power @xmath34 is then obtained from interference terms like p ~ ~_em + o(^3 ) + , the above formula gives an adequate result for the leading contribution at low energies , and the corrections due to imaginary parts of other amplitudes arise at the order @xmath46 .",
    "assuming the degree of linear polarization in the photon beam to be of order 1% , and going to very backward angles , so that @xmath74 , we see that such qed final state interactions can lead to asymmetries of the order a^fsi&~&0.010.1 2 + & ~&10 ^ -72    as one can see , the analyzing power represents a very substantial background for a measurement of a @xmath1-violating compton scattering , as well as that of the parity - violating compton scattering as proposed in @xcite .",
    "this background can be distinguished experimentally by measuring the complete azimuthal angle dependence of the considered single spin asymmetry .",
    "the final result is given by a cosine - modulated fsi contribution plus a constant term in @xmath72 that is the @xmath34- and @xmath1-odd pieces .",
    "these estimates indicate that whenever @xmath1-violation in compton scattering is due to mechanisms that can directly contribute to the edm , as well , the corresponding asymmetries can not exceed roughly @xmath75 at energies just below the pion threshold .",
    "i will next examine the upper limit constraint on @xmath1-violation in spin - independent compton scattering .    as a possible ,",
    "although exotic scenario , one can assume that an unknown source of @xmath1-violation may exist , that generates the @xmath0-odd compton amplitude but is for some reason forbidden to show up in just one photon vertex ( for instance , the spin - independent @xmath1-odd term is not present in the one photon coupling , but arises in compton scattering ) .",
    "an example of such a lagrangian is a dimension-7 operator l = c ( ) _ f^f^ |nn , where @xmath76 represents the scale of the unknown @xmath1-violating new physics that is integrated out and is replaced by the above effective vertex , and @xmath77 the corresponding wilson coefficient .",
    "this operator generates the non - born part of the amplitude @xmath78 only , since the edm is supposed not to obtain contribution from this mechanism , 4_3^= [ eq : a3np ] where the wilson coefficient should be taken at low energy .",
    "the edm then arises at one - loop level as a qed radiative correction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : npedm ] ( d_n)~ such that we obtain a limit on this new physics contributions from the edm , c()10 ^ -10 the loop calculation contains a quadratic divergence due to the neglection of the vertex structure within an effective field theory treatment . to obtain",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate of this loop contribution , i use the `` naive dimensional analysis '' method @xcite that is based on the dimensional regularization approach that ensures that the only mass scales arising in such a calculation are physical particle masses . the quadratic divergence",
    "itself should cancel exactly , once one specifies the underlying theory that is renormalizable .",
    "unless there exists a symmetry that enforces the exact cancellation , at low photon energies this cancellation should not occur at 100% level .",
    "then , the naive dimensional analysis estimate is still adequate .    combining this limit with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a3np ] ) and ( [ eq : ssa ] ) we arrive to the following upper limit for the @xmath1-violating asymmetry generated by the new physics : a^np10 ^ -11 to arrive to this result i neglected the running of the wilson coefficient @xmath77 .",
    "this running may indeed be substantial , but one would rather expect a logarithmical , and not quadratic running , therefore the @xmath79 will be dominant for the dependence of the above limit on the new physics scale .",
    "an accurate treatment can indeed change the estimate somewhat , and i leave this investigation for a future work , as this calculation goes beyond the scope of the present article .    since the pion is the lightest hadronic state",
    ", this result means that the calculation of the @xmath1-odd polarizabilities of the nucleon in the chpt with pions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : polhbchpt ] ) represents the dominant contribution due to the @xmath79 suppression of heavier particles contributions .",
    "in other words , if a substantial @xmath1-violating mechanism in nucleon spin - independent compton scattering exists , it should involve some light particles , like pions or eta s for instance , to be observable at the same level as the @xmath1-violating @xmath80 coupling contribution considered here in greater detail .",
    "in summary , i considered compton scattering in the presence of @xmath1-violation .",
    "i defined the compton amplitudes that possess this feature and applied the low energy theorem to this amplitude .",
    "after the separation of the born contribution that is defined by static properties of the nucleon and its edm , i parametrized the unknown non - born part by introducing the model - independent structure constants , the nucleon @xmath0-odd polarizabilities .",
    "i calculated these polarizabilities in the assumption that the @xmath1-violation is due to non - zero qcd @xmath5-term that generates a @xmath1-violating @xmath80 coupling .",
    "i furthermore proposed an observable in compton scattering that is directly sensitive to @xmath1-violation that is a single - spin asymmetry with circularly polarized photon beam . within the model for the @xmath0-odd polarizabilities used in this work",
    ", i estimated such an asymmetry to be of order @xmath81 , @xmath17 being the photon energy , and found that it is picked at backward angles .",
    "the above limit originates from the experimentaql limits on edm translated into the strength of the qcd @xmath5-term .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath1-odd asymmetry is always accompanied by the @xmath34-violation contribution to compton scattering which was estimated in the literature as @xmath82 and is suppressed at backward angles as @xmath70 .",
    "i also considered a background process that involves the linear polarization component in the photon beam which can lead to azimuthal angle - dependent asymmetry due to final state interactions that generate an imaginary part of compton scattering . at very backward angles ,",
    "such fsi can lead to asymmetries of order @xmath83 , with @xmath72 the angle between the direction of the linear polarization and the scattering plane .",
