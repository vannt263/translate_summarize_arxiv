    "the inclination of a spiral galaxy ( i.e. , the angle between the galactic plane and the tangent plane of the celestial sphere ) is not only an important parameter , but also difficult to determine .",
    "a spiral galaxy consists of a thin disk , a bulge and spiral arms that are thought to be situated in the disk .",
    "if we assume that the thickness of the spiral plane is rather negligible in comparision to its extension , and that when a spiral galaxy is inclined moderately to the plane of sky , the thickness of the nucleus can be omitted , the inclination @xmath1 can be obtained by :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the apparent major and minor isophotal diameters respectively . when a spiral galaxy is seen edge - on , it is not possible to consider the thickness of the nuclear part as negligible",
    "thus , eq . ( 1 ) can not be used to calculate the inclination .",
    "the reason for this is that the apparent minor isophotal - diameter consists of two parts .",
    "one is attributed by the disk and , another by the bulge , the latter of which will decrease the real value of the inclination .    considering that the disk is not infinitely thin , aaronson et al .",
    "( 1980 ) corrected eq .",
    "( 1 ) by    @xmath5    the constant of @xmath6 is added in accordance with an empirical recipe . a more elaborate specification of the axial ratio for an edge - on system that depends on the hubble type could be justified .",
    "the thinnest galaxies are sc spirals , earlier types have larger bulges .",
    "giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) provided an example to justify why they assumed the axial ratio of sc galaxies to be 0.13 .",
    "a smaller value of the axial ratio for an edge - on system results in smaller derived inclinations , where the spirals are more face - on . besides , if the values @xmath3 and @xmath4 are approximations due to errors , the inclination obtained by eq .",
    "( 2 ) is not an exact value .",
    "ma et al . ( 1997 , 1998 ) proposed a method to determine the inclination of a spiral galaxy by fitting a spiral arm with a logarithmic spiral form with constant pitch angle .",
    "they obtained the inclinations of 72 northern spiral galaxies .",
    "the question of the mathematical form of spiral arms was recognized at the beginning of this century ( von der pahlen , 1911 ; groot , 1925 ) .",
    "then , danver ( 1942 ) , kennicutt ( 1981 ) and kennicutt & hodge ( 1982 ) systematically studied the shapes of spiral arms . using the method of the least squares and as many points as possible situated on the spiral arm in question , danver ( 1942 ) studied a sample of 98 nearby spirals by drawing the projected images on white paper and then , by copying it on the paper to be used for the measurement thanks to transparent illumination .",
    "kennicutt ( 1981 ) measured the shapes of spiral arms in 113 nearby sa - sc galaxies by disposing directly of photographic enlargement and using an iterative procedure to correct for inclination effects .",
    "he gave an initial estimate of the inclination and pitch angle to orient the spiral to a face - on geometry , and then used any residual sinusoidal deviations in the arm shapes to make small corrections to the derived orientation . using the iraf software , ma et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) fitted the shapes of spiral arms on the images , so that they could show clearly whether the fitting was good or not .",
    "the display program of iraf software can enlarge the image and change its grey scale to minimize any personal prejudice about the regularity and prominence of arms .",
    "but we must emphasize that the display program of iraf has many variables , so the results are not always objective . in our program , we modify z1 ( minimum greylevel to be displayed ) and z2 ( maximum greylevel to be displayed ) in the display program in order to display the images clearly . in the procedure of fitting , we emphasize the global spiral structure , where , except for the small - scale distortions , the arms can be represented by the logarithmic spiral forms .    there has been much interest concerning the separation of disk and bulge components in the observed surface brightness distribution of spiral galaxies .",
    "de vaucouleurs ( 1958 ) , for instance , established an isophotic map of m  31 in blue light by means of direct photoelectric scans , spaced at 10@xmath7 intervals in declination from + 39@xmath831@xmath7 to 42@xmath830@xmath7 . from photoelectric photometry , he determined that the thickness of the flat component is about 0.8 kpc . by assuming that a galaxy has an infinitesimally thin disk , freeman ( 1970 ) and sandage et al .",
    "( 1970 ) collected and studied the radial distribution of the surface brightness @xmath9 for thirty - six s0 and spiral galaxies , and showed that @xmath9 distribution for these galaxies can be presented by two main components : an inner spheroidal component which follows the law of @xmath10 and an outer exponential component ( disk ) , with @xmath11 where @xmath12 is defined as a radial scale length .",
    "van der kruit and searle ( 1981a ) proposed a model for the light distribution in the disks of edge - on spiral galaxies , assuming that a galaxy has a locally isothermal , self - gravitating and truncated exponential disk .",
    "this model has the feature of being isothermal in @xmath13 at all radii with a scale parameter @xmath14 and has an exponential dependence of surface brightness upon @xmath15 with a scale length @xmath12 .",
    "the space - luminosity of this model can be described by @xmath16 with this model , van der kruit & searle ( 1981a , 1981b , 1982a , 1982b ) determined @xmath12 and @xmath14 for seven disk - dominated and one spheroid - dominated spiral galaxies by using three - color surface photometry .",
    "peng et al ( 1979 ) investigated three - dimensional disk galaxies , based on the fundamental assumption by parenago that the density distribution along @xmath13-direction for a finite thickness disk is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is defined as an exponential scale height , @xmath19 is defined as a thickness of disk and equals @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the surface density . by solving poission s equation for a logarithmic density perturbation , peng et al .",
    "( 1979 ) obtained a criterion for density waves to appear , which is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the polar coordinate of the starting point from which arms of a galaxy stretch outward on the galactic plane , and @xmath24 is the number of the arms in a spiral galaxy .",
    "based on this criterion , peng ( 1988 ) proposed a method for estimating the thickness of a non - edge - on spiral , and derived the thicknesses of four galaxies .",
    "guthrie ( 1992 ) derived the axial ratios @xmath25 of disc components for 262 edge - on spiral galaxies on print copies of the blue palomar sky survey plates by using a microscope fitted with a micrometer eyepiece .",
    "he then analyzed the distribution of isophotal axial ratios for 888 diameter - limited normal sa - sc galaxies to give information on the true axial ratios @xmath26 , and at last presented the mean value of @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) derived the thicknesses of 72 spirals by using peng s proposal ( peng , 1988 ) and presented some statistical correlations between thickness or flatness and other parameters .",
    "the value of @xmath26 derived by guthrie ( 1992 ) is based on observational work and , should be much more reliable .",

    "2 shows @xmath0 as a function of different hubble types .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath0 of spiral galaxies decreases smoothly an average along the hubble type , but the dispersion in @xmath0 among galaxies of the same hubble sequence is very large .",
    "this , perhaps , reflects that the intrinsic flattening of spiral disks is smaller for later type galaxies . de grijs ( 1998 ) also shows that galaxies become systematically thinner when going from type s0 to sc .",
    "fig .  3 plots @xmath0 as a function of total ( `` face - on '' ) absolute magnitude in the b band . in fig .",

    "4 plots @xmath0 as a function of total galactic color index ( @xmath63 ) in the rc3 and shows a strong trend which suggests that a bluer galaxy has a smaller value of @xmath0 .",
    "roberts & haynes ( 1994 ) studied the physical parameters along the hubble sequence systematically by making use of two primary catalogues , the rc3 and a private catalogue maintained by r. giovanclli & m. haynes .",

    "4 also implies that later - type galaxies have smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "tully & fisher ( 1977 ) showed that if a spiral structure is well defined , the opening of the spiral structure could be used to define the inclination of the disk .",
    "it has been shown by danver ( 1942 ) , kennicutt ( 1981 ) and kennicutt & hodge ( 1982 ) that the spiral arm can be represented by a logarithmic spiral form with a constant pitch angle .",
    "grosb@xmath45l ( 1985 ) studied 605 galaxies with inclination angles inferior to @xmath76 , and estimated the position and inclination angles of these galaxies based on the bisymmetric intensity distribution in their outer parts applying a one dimensional fourier transform method .",
    "ma et al . ( 1997 , 1998 ) obtained the inclinations of 72 northern spiral galaxies by fitting the arms on the images .",
    "the rc3 lists the values of @xmath77 and their errors , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the apparent major and minor isophotal diameters measured at or reduced down to the surface brightness level @xmath78 b magnitudes per square arcsecond .",

    "this figure shows that , when we take into account the errors in the inclination due to errors in @xmath77 , and although there is some scatter , ma et al.s result ( 1997 , 1998 ) is consistent with what is derived from eq . ( 2 ) .",
    "hubble ( 1926 , 1936 ) introduced an early scheme to classify galaxies .",
    "its concepts are still in use , a sequence starting from elliptical to spiral galaxies , and including lenticular .",
    "this scheme has been extended by some astronomers ( holmberg , 1958 ; de vaucouleurs , 1956 , 1959 ; morgan , 1958 , 1959 ; van den bergh , 1960a , b , 1976 ; sandage , 1961 ; sandage & tammann , 1981 , 1987 ; sandage & bedke , 1993 ) over the years , who tried to employ multiple classification criteria .",
    "the two main systems commonly used are derived from hubble s original classification criteria .",
    "one is the hubble system as explained in detail by sandage ( 1961 ) , sandage & tammann ( 1981 , 1987 ) and sandage & bedke ( 1993 ) , and another , developed by de vaucouleurs ( 1956 , 1959 ) , adds more detailed descriptions to the notation and makes a division and extension of the sc and sbc families by introducing the scd , sd , sdm , sm and i m subdivisions .",
    "galaxy morphological classification is still mainly done visually by dedicated astronomers , based on the hubble s original scheme and its modification .",
    "it is possible for each observer to give slightly different weights to various criteria , although the criteria for classification are accepted generally by them .",
    "lahav et al . (",
    "1995 ) and naim et al .",
    "( 1995 ) investigated the consistency of visual morphological classifications of galaxies from six independent observers .",
    "they found that individual observers agree with one another with combined rms dispersions of between 1.3 and 2.3 type units , typically about 1.8 units of the revised hubble numerical type index t , although there are some cases where the range of types given to it was superior to 4 units in width .",
    "the tightness of the spiral arm , in addition to the degree of resolution in the arm and the relative size of the unresolved nuclear region , are the fundamental criteria in hubble s ( 1926 , 1936 ) classification of spiral galaxies . in order to better understand the nature and origin of the hubble sequence and evaluate the difference of classification , kennicutt ( 1981 ) compared the arm pitch angles as measured by him with the hubble type as determined by sandage & tammann ( 1981 , hereafter st ) and yerkes class by morgan ( 1958 , 1959 ) . from figs . 7 and 8 in kennicutt ( 1981 )",
    ", we can see that , although the st s classification is based almost solely upon disk resolution and the morgan s is based entirely on the central concentration of the galaxies , the trends between the arm pitch angles and the two types are almost the same . in the classifications by de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1976 , rc2 ; 1991 , rc3 ) , all these three criteria are considered .",
    "a most important feature of spiral galaxies is that the stellar content between the spiral arms and the spheroidal component is very different , and the central part is redder than the arm region .",
    "the yerkes system by morgan ( 1958 , 1959 ) contains the information on the state of stellar evolution in the central region of galaxies and it complements the information in the hubble sequence by de vaucouleurs ( 1956 , 1959 ) , which , in cases of conflicting criteria , emphasizes more strongly the strength of population in the arm .",
    "there are other sets of classifications in which disk - to - bulge is the primary discriminant ( van den bergh , 1976 ) or the ratio of disk - to - bulge to spiral arm morphology is primarily considered ( dressler , 1980 ; wilkerson , 1980 ) . among these three criteria , perhaps , spiral arm morphology may be distance independent .    until now , there are only a few papers dealing with pitch angles .",
    "so , the mean value of pitch angle for the different hubble types , which is an important parameter in the decision of whether the wkb approximation can be satisfied ( binney & tremaine , 1987 ) , has not been presented .",

    "the results are consistent between kennicutt ( 1981 ) and ma et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . some of the discrepancies can be attributed to our measured error , and the others may be expected from the galaxies themselves ; for example , when a spiral galaxy has two asymmetric arms : different authors ( kennicutt , 1981 ; ma et al .",

    "7 presents the mean values versus the hubble types in the rc3 , and it shows that , from the early to late hubble types , the mean values of the pitch angle increase , although the value for s0/a s is larger than that for sa s . in fact , it is difficult to distinguish between s0/a and sa .    besides hubble classification systems , elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1982a , b ; 1987 ) introduced another classification system which is designed to emphasize arm continuity , length and symmetry , and it is related to the presence or strength of density waves .",
    "this system is not dependent on the galaxy hubble sequence and contains 12 distinct arm classes , corresponding to a systematic change from the ragged and patchy arms in ` flocculent ' galaxies to the two symmetric and continuous arms in ` grand design ' ones .",
    "intermediate arm classes show characteristics of both the ` flocculent ' and ` grand design ' types . based on their spiral arm classification system , elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1982a , b ; 1987 ) classified the spiral galaxies in the field , in binary systems , in groups and in clusters , and suggested that bars tend to correlate with spiral density waves , companions may influence ( or generate ) symmetric density waves , grand design galaxies are physically larger than flocculent ones by a factor of @xmath90 1.5 , and grand design galaxies are also preferentially in dense groups .",
    "in this paper , we investigate some statistical correlations about the thickness of galactic disks and pitch angles of spiral arms .",
    "the main conclusions are : ( 1 ) .",
    "early - type spirals , that are brighter on the average , are thicker ; ( 2 ) . the axis ratio ( @xmath0 , here @xmath91 and @xmath92 are defined as two times the radial scale length ( @xmath12 ) and exponential scale height ( @xmath18 ) ) of galactic disk tends to be smaller along the hubble sequence ; ( 3 ) . except for a few galaxies , early - type spiral galaxies have larger values of @xmath0 ; ( 4 ) . @xmath0",
    "correlates strongly with galaxy color ; ( 5 ) .",
    "the inclinations obtained by fitting the pattern of spiral structure with a logarithmic spiral form are nearly the same as those obtained by using the formulas of aaronson et al .",

    ". thus the wkb approximation can be satisfied at the mean pitch angles from sa - sc s , but not by very much ; ( 7 ) . from early",
    "to late hubble types , the mean value of pitch angle increases , despite some scattering .",
    "although the method , proposed by peng ( 1988 ) for deriving the thickness of a face - on disc , is effective and simple , it relies on a spiral structure theory that predicts that a spiral arm has to end somewhere in the disk .",
    "however , this theory might not be completely right .",
    "for example , zaritsky et al . (",
    "1993 ) has presented k - band ( 2.2 @xmath93 ) images of m  51 , which reveal remarkable dynamical structure not visible in the conventional optical observations , and show that the spiral arms extend significantly further towards the galaxy s center than previously observed . in the optical images ,",
    "the spiral arms begins at a radius of about @xmath94 from the center .",
    "but , the k - band residual image showed the spiral arms wind through an additional @xmath95 beyond that seen in the b - band images of the entire galaxy , and end at about @xmath96 from the center of the galaxy .",
    "if spiral galaxies whose spiral arms do not stop anywhere in the disk exist , the parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( peng , 1988 ; ma et al .",
    ", 1997 , 1998 ) can not be found . in the k - band images , which minimize the effect of dust and maximize sensitivity to the dominant stellar population",
    ", we can derive our reliable values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "as an example , we apply our method to the image of m  51 in the k - band and derive the flatness of disk ( @xmath99 ) , which is @xmath100 . comparing this value with peng s ( 1988 ) ( @xmath101 )",
    ", we can find that the value of the flatness based on the k - band image is smaller .",
    "the reason is that , in the k - band image , the effect of dust can be minimized and the values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 may be reliably derived .",
    "we also emphasize that the images , which ma et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used , are from the digitized palomar sky survey , in which many images have burnt - out centers .",
