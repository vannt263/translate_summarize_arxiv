    "the success of any manufacturing process for particulate products depends on some key attributes of the particles which influence the outcome of various downstream operations carried out in the manufacturing process .",
    "in particular , the particle attributes of size and shape influence their behaviours such as flowability , filterability , ease of dissolution and so on .",
    "these behaviours in turn determine if the various downstream operations will be successful or not .",
    "hence it is necessary that the particles possess the desired particle size distribution ( psd ) and shape for a particular process @xcite .",
    "a very important upstream operation which is crucial to the manufacture of particulate products is the crystallisation process .",
    "the psd and shape of the particles produced during this crystallisation process vary due to a number of factors which include the nature of the material of which the particles are composed and the crystallisation process conditions .",
    "the combination of factors that will lead to the production of particles with the desired psd and shape are not easily determined .",
    "therefore , for the production of particles with the desired psd and shape during crystallisation processes , it is necessary that the crystallisation process be controlled so as to produce tailor made particles .    in order to control crystallisation processes ,",
    "it is necessary that the psd and shape of the particles produced in the process be monitored in situ , and this can be achieved by the use of inline sensors .",
    "however , these inline sensors have limitations on their applicability which could be due to the working principles of the sensors or various effects from the process or both",
    ". these limitations will influence the level of accuracy of the estimated psd and aspect ratio ( the metric for quantifying particle shape ) obtained using these sensors .",
    "this will then determine if the estimated psd and aspect ratio obtained from the sensor data is representative of the particles being measured .    in this work , we examine various process conditions and their effects on two inline sensors ; the mettler toledo focused beam reflectance measurement ( fbrm ) and the particle vision and measurement ( pvm ) sensors .",
    "these two sensors have been chosen because of their wide applicability in various particulate processes .",
    "we employ these sensors in different wet milling processes of three different organic crystalline particles .",
    "wet milling is one of the key processes carried out in industry during the production of particulate products .",
    "this process produces different effects typical of crystallisation processes .",
    "we explore the performance of these sensors under these effects .",
    "the methodology employed in this work consisted of wet milling experiments and subsequent analysis of data acquired inline and offline .",
    "the materials , equipment and experimental procedure employed are described in subsections [ subsec2 - 1 ] to [ subsec2 - 3 ] , while the methods of data analysis used are described in subsection [ subsec2 - 4 ] .",
    "the following materials were used in this work : paracetamol ( 98.0 - 102.0% usp ) , benzoic acid ( @xmath0% ) , and metformin hydrochloride ( reagent grade ) . both paracetamol and benzoic acid",
    "were purchased from sigma - aldrich while metformin hydrochloride was purchased from molekula .",
    "the benzoic acid particles were suspended in distilled water obtained from an in - house purification system , and the surfactant tween 20 from sigma - aldrich was added to the benzoic acid slurry to ease dispersion of the particles and avoid foaming .",
    "however , the paracetamol and metformin hydrochloride were both suspended in 2-propanol ( reagent grade , cas : 67 - 63 - 0 , assay ( glc ) @xmath0% ) obtained from from fisher scientific , uk .",
    "the experiments were conducted in a closed loop consisting of a mettler toledo optimax workstation made up of a 1l stirred tank crystallizer equipped with an inline hastelloy pt100 temperature sensor .",
    "the workstation was connected to a watson marlow du520 peristaltic pump , which was subsequently connected to an ika magiclab ( module utl ) rotor stator wet mill .",
    "the wet mill was finally connected back to the workstation to close the loop as sketched in fig .",
    "the temperature of the wet mill was controlled with a lauda heater / chiller unit as shown in fig .",
    "the process conditions of temperature and stirring speed of the slurry in the workstation were controlled using the icontrol v5.2 software from mettler toledo .",
    "data related to the size and the shape of the particles in the wet milling processes was captured with the mettler toledo fbrm g400 series and pvm v819 sensors within the stirred tank as sketched in fig .",
    "the fbrm sensor produces a narrow laser beam which moves in a circular trajectory .",
    "the beam , when incident on a particle , traces out a chord on the particle .",
    "the lengths of chords measured over a pre - set period of time for particles in the slurry is then reported as a chord length distribution ( cld ) @xcite .",
    "the pvm sensor takes images of the particles using eight ( some of which can be switched off ) laser beams .",
    "the images are recorded on a ccd array which are subsequently transferred to a computer .",
    "the size of each image of the pvm v819 is @xmath1 pixels with a pixel size of @xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "offline particle size and shape analyses were carried out using the malvern morphologi g3 instrument .",
    "the morphologi instrument consists of a dispersion unit which utilizes compressed air to disperse the particles over a glass plate .",
    "images of particles on the plate are captured using a camera with a microscope lens .",
    "the images are then analysed by the instrument software for size and shape information .      at the start of each experiment , a saturated solution of",
    "approximately 900ml was generated inside the optimax vessel at 25@xmath3c by adding the required quantity of solid .",
    "the temperature was ramped to 40 - 50@xmath3c to speed up dissolution and subsequently cooled to 25@xmath3c over 20min .",
    "once the temperature had reached the setpoint value , some solid particles ( whose mass varied with the different materials ) was added and allowed to equilibrate for 60min . before the addition of these solid particles , a sample of the original material ( starting material ) was initially analysed with the offline morphologi instrument for psd and aspect ratio information .",
    "after the equilibration period ( covering a period @xmath4 ) , the peristaltic pump and wet mill were started simultaneously .",
    "the speed of the pump was maintained at 50rpm throughout the experiments while that of the wet mill was initially set to 6000rpm ( for a duration @xmath5 ) after which it was increased in stages . at the next stage ( with duration @xmath6 ) of the process , the speed of the wet mill was increased to 10,000rpm , and subsequently to 14,000rpm ( for a duration @xmath7 ) and finally to 18,000rpm ( for a duration @xmath8 ) .",
    "the temperature of the mill outlet was regulated manually by adjusting the heater chiller setpoint in order to maintain it at 25@xmath3c and prevent dissolution .",
    "the time intervals @xmath4 to @xmath8 varied from 30 - 90min for each material .    at the end of the time interval @xmath8 ,",
    "the suspension was filtered and washed in a buchner funnel .",
    "the same solvents which were used in the experiments for benzoic acid and metformin hydrochloride were used for washing each material at the end of their respective experiments , while paracetamol was washed with chilled water .",
    "each of the cakes obtained at the end of each wet milling process was dried overnight in a vacuum oven . like the starting material",
    ", samples of the dry cakes ( milled product ) obtained at the end of each wet milling process were analysed for psd and aspect ratio information using the offline morphologi instrument .",
    "benzoic acid particles were prepared by using antisolvent crystallisation ( after dissolution of the original sample from sigma - aldrich ) in order to obtain long needle shaped crystals .",
    "the particles were filtered and dried before being suspended in water for the milling experiment .",
    "the particles were suspended in water ( saturated with benzoic acid ) due to the low solubility of benzoic acid in water . however , due to poor wettability of benzoic acid in water , the surfactant tween 20 was used at a concentration of 2ml / l .",
    "the solid loading in this experiment was 1.6% w / w .",
    "the original paracetamol sample from sigma - aldrich was dissolved in isoamyl alcohol after which prism like particles were obtained by cooling crystallisation .",
    "the particles obtained from the cooling crystallisation were then suspended in a saturated solution of paracetamol in 2-propanol for the wet milling experiment .",
    "the solid loading in this case was 4.2% w / w .",
    "although the solubility of paracetamol in 2-propanol is relatively high , the solvent was chosen to avoid agglomeration .",
    "the metformin sample from molekula was used directly as the particles were already needle shaped .",
    "the particles were then suspended in a saturated solution of metformin in 2-propanol ( in which metformin has a low solubility and good dispersion ) for the wet milling process .",
    "the solid loading in this case was 3.5% w / w .",
    "the wet milling process for metformin was stopped at the stage @xmath7 ( with the mill speed of 14,000 rpm ) as the particles were quickly broken in this case .",
    "as mentioned in section [ subsec2 - 3 ] , the starting material and the milled product for each material were analysed for psd and aspect ratio information using the offline morphologi instrument .",
    "the cld data acquired using the inline fbrm sensor were analysed using a previously developed algorithm @xcite for psd and aspect ratio information .",
    "similarly , the images captured using the inline pvm sensor were analysed using a previously developed @xcite image processing algorithm also for size and shape information .",
    "the number of particles produced during each wet milling process relative to the number of initially suspended particles ( for each of the materials ) can be estimated from analysis of images and cld data .",
    "the number of initially suspended particles can be estimated from the mass of initially suspended particles and the volume based psd of each starting material estimated with the offline morphologi instrument .",
    "even though the sample of each starting material initially analysed with the offline morphologi instrument is not the same as the sample that was suspended for each wet milling process , the estimated number of initially suspended particles will still be reasonable , as long as the particles in the original powder of each material were well mixed .    to estimate the number of initially suspended particles , the particle length @xmath9 is discretised and classified into @xmath10 bins with the characteristic length @xmath11 of bin @xmath12 representing the length of particles in bin @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the bin boundaries of bin @xmath12 .",
    "the number of particles @xmath15 in bin @xmath12 is given as @xmath16 where , @xmath17 is the mass fraction of the particles in bin @xmath12 , @xmath18 is the mass of the initially suspended particles , @xmath19 is the density of particles and @xmath20 is the volume of the particles in bin @xmath12 . approximating the shape of all particles in each bin with an ellipsoid of semi - major axis length @xmath21 and two equal semi - minor axis length @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the mean aspect ratio of all the particles in bin @xmath12 , gives the volume of the particles in bin @xmath12 as @xmath24 . since all particles have the same density , the mass fraction of the particles in bin @xmath12 can be replaced by their volume fraction @xmath25 . then the number of particles in bin @xmath12 becomes @xmath26 and the number of initially suspended particles @xmath27 is given as @xmath28 the number of particles in the slurry can be estimated from cld data using eqs . and",
    "however , since eq . requires the volume fraction of particles , the volume based psd is first estimated from the cld data .",
    "this is accomplished using the inversion algorithm developed in @xcite .",
    "then the volume fraction of particles can be estimated , and hence the number of particles @xmath29 in the slurry using eq . .",
    "subsequently , the number of particles in the slurry relative to the number of initially suspended particles @xmath30 can be estimated .    in the case of image analysis , the mean number of objects per frame @xmath31 is estimated by first counting all objects which were detected in focus and contained wholly within the image frames .",
    "this number of objects is then divided by the number of frames containing at least one object in focus to obtain @xmath31 .",

    "similarly , there is a more pronounced shift of the aspect ratio pdf in the case of paracetamol ( in fig . [ fig3](b ) ) when compared with that of benzoic acid in fig . [ fig2](d ) .",
    "this could be due to differences in material properties between benzoic acid and paracetamol making them respond differently to the wet mill .",

    "this is also reflected in the shift in particle length on moving from the starting material to the milled product seen in fig .",

    "another possible reason why the length dimensions of around @xmath41 m were not captured well in the cld data could be that some of the particles in the starting material had been broken down during the time interval @xmath4 reducing their contribution to the cld count .",

    "this is especially true for systems composed of long needle - like particles mixed with shorter or more rounded particles .",
    "this is because the cld method needs to find a compromise psd which fits the measured cld at an appropriate aspect ratio . in systems like these",

    "however , the inline imaging method is limited to particles of sizes above about @xmath58 m , whereas the cld method can go to smaller sizes .",
    "in addition , the psd estimated by the inline imaging method becomes less representative as the sizes of the particles approach the size of the image frame .",
    "the accuracy of the psd estimate is also affected by the proportion of objects that are captured outside the focal plane of the camera .",
    "similarly , the psd estimated by the cld method becomes less representative as the length of needle - like or rod - like particles approach the diameter of the circular trajectory of the fbrm laser spot making the chord length probability estimate less accurate .",
    "hence , in systems composed of a mixture of needle - like or rod - like particles and more rounded particles of various sizes , a combination of both the cld and inline imaging methods ( probably in a multi - objective approach ) should give more robust estimates of the psd and the aspect ratio .",
