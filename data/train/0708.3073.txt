    "the theory of phase transitions , among many results , substantiates the possibility of constructing reliable systems from non - reliable elements . as an example , consider the infinite volume stochastic ising model at low temperature @xmath0 in dimension @xmath1 see @xcite .",
    "it is well known , that if we start this system from the configuration of all pluses , then the evolution under glauber dynamics has the property that the fraction of plus spins at any time exceeds @xmath2 which is bigger than @xmath3 for @xmath4 ( here @xmath5 is the spontaneous magnetization . ) on the other hand , if we consider finite volume ising model ( with empty boundary condition , say ) , then this property does not hold , and the system , started from the all plus state , will be found in the state with the majority of the spins to be minuses at some later ( random ) times . therefore , the infinite system can remember , to some extent , its initial state , while the finite system can not .",
    "there are many other examples of this kind , that belong to the theory of interacting particle systems , such as voter model , contact model , etc . in all these examples",
    "we see systems , that are capable of remembering  their initial state for arbitrary long times .    in the present paper we are constructing a particle system that remembers its initial phase .",
    "the rough analogy can be described as follows .",
    "imagine a brownian particle @xmath6 with a unit drift , which lives on a circle .",
    "suppose the initial phase @xmath7 then the mean phase @xmath8 but with time we know the phase @xmath9 less and less precisely , since its variance grows , and in the limit @xmath10 the distribution of @xmath9 tends to the uniform one .",
    "however , one can combine infinitely many such particles by introducing suitable interaction between them in such a way that the memory of the initial phase does not vanish and persists in time .",
    "namely , one has to put such particles at the sites of @xmath11 and to introduce the attractive interaction between them .",
    "if the initial state is chosen to be coherent , then the phase of every particle will grow linearly , while its variance will stay bounded .",
    "this is roughly what we do in the present paper .",
    "we consider a network of simple servers which are processing messages .",
    "since the service time of every message is random , in the course of time each single server loses the memory of its initial state .",
    "so , in particular , the network of non - interacting servers , started in the same state , becomes de - synchronized after a finite time .",
    "however , if one introduces certain natural interconnection between servers , then it can happen that they are staying synchronized after an arbitrary long time , thus breaking some generally believed properties of large networks .",
    "we have to add here that such a phenomenon is possible only if the mean number of particles per server is high enough ; otherwise the infinite network becomes de - synchronized , no matter which kind of interaction between servers takes place .",
    "so the parameter of the mean number of particles per server , called hereafter _ the load _ , plays the same role as the temperature in the statistical mechanics .",
    "in other words , the transition we describe happens due to the fact that at low load the behavior of our system is governed by the fixed point of the underlying dynamical system , while at high load the dominant role is played by its periodic attractor .",
    "a similar phenomenon was described by hepp and lieb in @xcite .",
    "below we present the simplest example of the above behavior .",
    "but we believe that the phenomenon we describe is fairly general .",
    "its origin lies in the fact that any large network of the general type possesses some kind of the continuous symmetry in the infinite limit , and it is breaking of that symmetry at high load that causes the long - range order behavior of the network . in our case",
    "this is the rotation symmetry , corresponding to the periodic orbit of the limiting dynamical system .",
    "now we will describe one pattern of behavior of certain large networks , which was assumed to be universal .",
    "it is known under the name of poisson hypothesis .",
    "the poisson hypothesis is a device to predict the behavior of large queuing networks .",
    "it was formulated first by l. kleinrock in @xcite , and concerns the following situation .",
    "suppose we have a large network of servers , through which many customers are traveling , being served at different nodes of the network .",
    "if the node is busy , the customers wait in the queue .",
    "customers are entering into the network from the outside via some nodes , and these external flows of customers are poissonian , with constant rates .",
    "the service time at each node is random , depending on the node , and the customer .",
    "the ph prediction about the ( long - time , large - size ) behavior of the network is the following :    * consider the total flow @xmath12 of customers to a given node @xmath13 then @xmath12 is approximately equal to a poisson flow , @xmath14 with a time dependent rate function @xmath15 * the exit flow from @xmath16  * not * poissonian in general !",
    " has a rate function @xmath17 which is smoother than @xmath18 ( due to averaging , taking place at the node @xmath16 ) . * as a result , the flows @xmath18 at various nodes @xmath16 should go to a constant limits @xmath19 , as @xmath20 the flows to different nodes being almost independent .",
    "* the above convergence is uniform in the size of the network .",
    "note that the distributions of the service times at the nodes of the network can be arbitrary , so ph deals with quite a general situation .",
    "the range of validity of ph is supposed to be the class of networks where the internal flow to every node @xmath16 is a union of flows from many other nodes , and each one of these flows constitutes only a small fraction of the total flow to @xmath13 if true , ph provides one with means to make easy computations of quantities of importance in network design .",
    "the rationale behind this conjectured behavior is natural : since the inflow is a sum of many small inputs , it is approximately poissonian . and",
    "due to the randomness of the service time the outflow from each node should be smoother  than the total inflow to this node .",
    "( this statement was proven in @xcite under quite general conditions . ) in particular , the variation of the latter should be smaller than that of the former , and so all the flows should converge to corresponding constant values .    in the paper @xcite the poisson hypothesis is proven for simple networks in the infinite volume limit , under some natural conditions . for systems with constant service times",
    "it was proven earlier in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to construct a network that satisfies the above assumption  that the flow to every given node is an infinite  sum of infinitesimally small  flows from other nodes  but has coherent states .",
    "that means that the states of the servers are evolving in a synchronous manner , and the phase  of a given server behaves ( in the thermodynamic limit ",
    "i.e. in the limit of infinite network ) as a periodic non - random function , the same for different servers",
    ".    we have to stress that our network exhibits these coherent states only in the regime when the average number @xmath21 of the customers per server  called in what follows _ the load ",
    "_ is large . for low load",
    "we expect the convergence to the unique stationary state",
    ". this high temperature  kind of behavior will be the subject of the forthcoming work .",
    "our network @xmath22 is constructed from infinitely many elementary triangular  networks @xmath23 ( described below , in section [ nabla ] ) .",
    "a single triangle network @xmath24 with @xmath21 customers is just a markov continuous time ergodic jump process with finitely many states .",
    "as @xmath21 becomes large , this markov process tends ( in the appropriate euler  limit ) to a ( 5-dimensional ) dynamical system @xmath25 , possessing a periodic trajectory @xmath26 which turns out to be a stable ( local ) attractor .",
    "the coordinate @xmath27 parameterizing that attractor @xmath28 is the phase  alluded to in the previous subsection .",
    "the combined network corresponds in the same sense to the coupled family @xmath29 of dynamical systems @xmath30 we establish the synchronization property of that coupled family @xmath31 and that allows us to construct coherent states of the network @xmath32    the networks @xmath33 composed of @xmath34 * * triangle networks @xmath35 are * * ergodic .",
    "their evolution is given by irreducible finite state markov processes with continuous time .",
    "let @xmath36 be the invariant measure of the process @xmath37 .",
    "as @xmath38 , the sequence of markov processes @xmath37 converges weakly on finite time intervals to a certain limiting ( non - linear markov ) process @xmath22 .",
    "* * by the theorem of khasminsky  see theorem 1.2.14 in @xcite  any accumulation point of the sequence @xmath36 is a stationary measure of @xmath22 .",
    "the special measure @xmath39 , describing the poisson hypothesis behavior , is also a stationary measure of @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath39 is a global attractor of @xmath22 , then , of course , the poisson hypothesis holds .",
    "the proof of the poisson hypothesis in @xcite was based on this argument .",
    "the existence of an accumulation point of the sequence @xmath36 that differs from @xmath39 would be the strongest counterexample to the poisson hypothesis .",
    "this problem will be addressed in forthcoming papers . here",
    "we prove a weaker statement that @xmath39 is not a global attractor for @xmath22 .",
    "* * in @xcite rybko and stolyar observed that the condition that the workload at every node of a multiclass open queueing network is less than @xmath40 is not sufficient for the network to be ergodic . in connection with this , they introduced a new approach to the analysis of ergodicity of networks , which reduces the problem to the question of stability of the associated fluid models .",
    "it was shown by them that the two - node priority network , considered in @xcite , is ergodic if and only if for every initial state of the corresponding fluid model the total amount of fluid vanishes eventually .",
    "this approach was further developed by dai @xcite , stolyar @xcite , and puhalsky and rybko @xcite , who proved that stability of the fluid model is necessary and sufficient for ergodicity of a certain class of general networks .",
    "interesting instances of non - ergodic queueing networks with mean load being smaller than the capacity , where considered by bramson @xcite . our construction will be based on the following open network introduced by rybko and stolyar ( rs - network ) in @xcite .",
    "this queuing network with four types of customers is represented by the following 4-dimensional markov process .",
    "customers arrive to the network according to poisson inflows of constant rate @xmath41 the network consists of two nodes  @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "all the service times are exponential , hence the network is defined by the rates , the evolution of types of the customers and the priorities .",
    "the customer of type @xmath44 ( respectively , @xmath45 ) arrives to the node @xmath42 ( respectively , @xmath43 ) .",
    "the customer @xmath44 is served with the rate @xmath46 then is sent to @xmath47 with type @xmath48 there he is served with the rate @xmath49 and leaves the network .",
    "symmetrically , @xmath50 and @xmath51 each customer @xmath52 is served before all the customers @xmath53 while each customer @xmath54 is served before all the customers @xmath44 . the nominal workload at nodes @xmath55 and @xmath43 equals @xmath56 .",
    "the service rates satisfy the conditions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that for certain values of the parameters the resulting markov process is transient . the fluid limit ( or the euler limit ) of this network evolves in the following non - trivial manner : each node is empty during a positive fraction of time , but at other moments it is non - empty , and , moreover , the total amount of the fluid in the network tends linearly to infinity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we define our networks @xmath59 here @xmath34 is the size of the network and @xmath21 is the load per node .",
    "we formulate the preliminary version of our main result . in section 3",
    "we study the limiting network , @xmath60 and prove the convergence @xmath61 in section 4 we introduce the fluid networks , @xmath62 which are coupled dynamical systems , and their limit , @xmath31 which turns out to be a non - linear dynamical system , in the sense made precise in this section .",
    "in particular , we show that @xmath29 is not ergodic . in the next section 5",
    "we prove the convergence of the non - linear markov process @xmath63 to its euler fluid limit , @xmath31 as @xmath64 the last section 6 contains the formulation and the proof of our main result , theorem [ mr ] .    to save on notation",
    ", we consider throughout this paper the simplest elementary symmetric model , depending on 3 parameters .",
    "we stress the fact that this ( discrete ) symmetry is not essential in our case , and our results are valid for any small 6d - perturbation of our model .",
    "we will consider the following 5-dimensional markov process , @xmath65 .",
    "it describes a closed queuing network with @xmath21 customers .",
    "it consists of three nodes : @xmath66 @xmath42 and @xmath47 through which the customers go .",
    "all the service times are exponential , so we only need to specify the rates , the evolution of types of the customers and the priorities . to simplify the presentation we will make a specific choice of these rates .",
    "the node @xmath67 serves all the customers on the fifo basis , with the rate @xmath68 after being served , the customer goes to the node @xmath42 or to @xmath47 choosing one of them with probability @xmath69 if he arrives to @xmath70 he gets the type @xmath71 otherwise @xmath72 the customer @xmath44 is served with the rate @xmath73 then is sent to @xmath47 with type @xmath48 there he is served with the rate @xmath74 and goes back to @xmath75 symmetrically , @xmath76 and @xmath77 each customer @xmath52 is served before all the customers @xmath53 and each customer @xmath54 is served before all the customers @xmath44 . more precisely ,",
    "if an @xmath52 customer arrives to the @xmath43 node , while the node is serving some @xmath45 customer , his service is stopped and is resumed only at the moment when the service of all @xmath52 customers is over .     + the elementary network .",
    "of course , the above choice of the rates is not the only possible",
    ". any other choice would be as good , provided the corresponding fluid network , which can be associated to our queuing network , has some specific property  namely , we need this fluid network to have a * cyclic regime*. the fluid network will be described in details in the section [ s21 ] below .",
    "let @xmath78be the markov process , obtained from @xmath34 copies of @xmath79 interconnected in the mean - field manner .",
    "we take the total number of customers to be @xmath80    the mean field network is defined as follows .",
    "* * each node @xmath81 @xmath82 , is connected to _ all _ of the nodes @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 , and each customer , leaving the node @xmath86 goes to each of the @xmath87 nodes @xmath83 @xmath88 with the same probability @xmath89 the rate of leaving the node @xmath90 is the same , as above , i.e. equals to @xmath68 in a similar way , the @xmath44 customers of every node @xmath91 are exiting it with the rate @xmath92 and then choose one of the @xmath88 nodes with probability @xmath93 and so on .",
    "the priorities are kept the same : if the node @xmath94 say , is in the state with customers of both kinds  @xmath44 and @xmath54  present , then the @xmath54 customers are served first , with no delay .",
    "+ two coupled processes .",
    "the configuration of the process is given by the number of customers of each type at each of the @xmath95 nodes , that is by an integer point in @xmath96 due to the mean - field symmetry , we can factor the set of configurations by the product of permutation groups @xmath97 and still have the markov process .",
