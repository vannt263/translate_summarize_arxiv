    "the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc4945 contains the first h@xmath0o maser discovered in a galactic nucleus ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . within the nucleus",
    "there is a heavily absorbed hard x - ray component ( @xmath13 kev ) , with a measured column density of @xmath14 @xmath15 ( @xcite ) , and true x - ray luminosity ( 220 kev ) of @xmath16 erg s@xmath17 .",
    "the hard component varies on timescales of hours , implying a source size of @xmath18 cm .",
    "the nucleus is very prominent at infrared wavelengths , with a far infrared luminosity @xmath19 erg s@xmath17 from the inner 200 pc ( @xcite ) , at an assumed distance of 3.7 mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the nucleus also shows a @xmath20 kpc ionization cone along the galactic minor axis ( @xcite ) and emission knots with liner - like spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "optical line splittings of up to @xmath21  ( @xcite , @xcite ) indicate that the cone is evacuated by a nuclear wind .",
    "while x - ray characteristics suggest that the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is driven by an obscured seyfert nucleus , the high ir luminosity and wind indicate the presence of a nuclear starburst .",
    "spectra of the maser consistently show emission ( @xmath22 jy ) within about @xmath23  of the systemic velocity and stronger emission ( @xmath24 jy ) red - shifted by @xmath25 ( e.g. , @xcite , figure  1 ) .",
    "previously , no corresponding emission on the blue side of the systemic velocity has been detected ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a heliocentric systemic velocity of @xmath26 , based on co observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "( velocities are defined with respect to the standard radio astronomical definition of doppler shift throughout . )",
    "the importance of nuclear h@xmath0o masers to the study of agn has been widely appreciated after recent observations of the maser in the nucleus of ngc 4258 ( @xcite ) , where the masers were found to trace a thin molecular keplerian disk of 0.13 pc inner radius around a central mass of @xmath27 m@xmath11 . in this letter ,",
    "we report the first sub - arcsecond estimate of the maser position in ngc4945 , the detection of blue - shifted maser features , and the first interferometric map of the distribution of maser emission .",
    "we observed the maser with the very long baseline array of the nrao@xmath28 for 4 hours    @xmath28 the national radio astronomy observatory is operated by associated universities , inc , under cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .    on 1995 january 22 .",
    "we used the southernmost stations , at mauna kea , hi ( mk ) , saint croix , vi ( sc ) , and kitt peak , az ( kp ) . at kp",
    "the source reached a maximum elevation of @xmath29 , while it was @xmath30 and rising at mk .",
    "we obtained useful data for only 2.5 hours on the mk  kp baseline . observing conditions at saint croix were relatively poor and no useful data were obtained from it .",
    "tipping scans showed that the opacity at kp , mk , and sc were 0.07 , 0.05 , and 0.3 at zenith , respectively .",
    "the baseline length was 4470 km and the angular resolutions were @xmath31 and @xmath32 milliarcseconds ( mas ) in right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "the system temperatures for @xmath33 elevation at kp and mk were 170 and 130 k , respectively .",
    "we recorded four contiguous bandpasses covering the range 405  to 821 , so as to include the systemic emission , the red - shifted emission , and the likely velocity range of counterpart blue - shifted emission .",
    "the spectrum is shown in figure  1 .",
    "we calibrated the data with the nrao aips package .",
    "the interferometer delays and fringe rates were estimated from observations of the continuum sources 4c39.25 , 3c273 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the latter source was observed at elevations @xmath35 and was included so that we could estimate the magnitude of elevation dependent errors in the correlator model and post - correlation analysis .",
    "the delay calibration is accurate to about 3 ns overall , after implementing the u. s. naval observatory station positions and earth orientation parameters ( eubanks , private communication ) .",
    "we analyzed the fringe rate of the maser emission as a function of time to estimate the position of the maser , taking into account the effect of the atmosphere .",
    "we fit a sinusoid to the measured fringe rates for emission between 664 and 719  ( with uniform weighting ) to obtain position offsets of @xmath36 and @xmath37 from the _ a priori _ position @xmath38 , @xmath39 , with respect to a reference frame consisting of the sources 4c39.25 , @xmath34 , and 3c273b .",
    "we conservatively estimate the uncertainties in position based on the residual fringe rates of the maser and calibrator sources . the new maser position is    @xmath40 @xmath41    to map the brightness distribution of the maser",
    ", we phase referenced the data to the strong spectral feature at @xmath42 . the phases of this feature were subtracted from the phases of other spectral features , which corrected for the effects of the atmosphere and calibration uncertainties .",
    "we assumed a point source model and fit a sinusoid ( of 24 hour period ) to the difference phase , estimating relative feature positions and formal errors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sample phase plots are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the data were averaged in frequency across the line profile for each feature and averaged in time for between 300 s and 640 s so that phase ambiguities could be resolved prior to fitting . for a 1 jy feature that is 1wide ( half power width )",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in 300 s is about 4 .",
    "the structure of the maser is remarkably linear , with emission distributed over @xmath7 mas between 414 and 719(figure  3 ) .",
    "deviations from linearity are antisymmetric with respect to the systemic emission , which gives the apprearance of a shallow `` s '' on the sky .",
    "the centroids of the blue and red emission are separated by @xmath43 mas or 0.55 pc , at a position angle of @xmath44 , and roughly symmetrically bracket the systemic emission . the wide separations among the systemic , red , and blue emission correspond to many interferometer fringes and are well determined .",
    "maser features that are detected only marginally ( i.e. , with a rms of residuals about the fitted model of @xmath45 rad ) are not shown in the map , although they do not appreciably alter the source structure .",
    "these marginal features include one at @xmath46 , which is more red - shifted than any previously reported maser emission in ngc4945 . in nonetheless , not all of the detected maser features could be mapped , particularly near the systemic and blue - shifted velocities , because a significant fraction are not well approximated by a point source model ( i.e. , the phases could not be fit by a diurnal sinusoid ) .",
    "the interferometer calibration was sufficiently good that uncertainty in the astrometric position of the maser is the largest source of quantifiable systematic error in estimating maser feature positions .",
    "the error is @xmath47 @xmath6as , which is computed for an astrometric uncertainty of 100 mas and for a feature 200  from the reference , and is proportional to both quantities .",
    "( residual atmospheric delay contributes a moderate systematic error because of the low elevations at which we observed the maser ; it is smaller than the error from the astrometry . )",
    "a second source of systematic error arises from the possibility that emission , for each feature , may not be well described by a point source , which is difficult to quantify .",
    "however , the data for each mapped maser feature is well fit by a point source model over the limited range of hour angle available . the systematic error in position for each maser feature is less than the statistical error , which is dominated by the limited range of hour angle over which the phases were measured .",
    "this limitation leads to 1 ) a large correlation between right ascension and declination parameters and 2 ) an uncertainty as to in which lobe of the interferometer fringe pattern the maser lies .",
    "uncertainties in the estimated positions take into account possible lobe ambiguities .",
    "the new astrometric position of the maser clearly shows that it is associated with the center of the galactic nucleus ( figure  5 ) . the previous position of batchelor(1982 ) , obtained with the parkes antenna of the csiro , was substantially more uncertain because of the beamwidth of the antenna .",
    "the maser lies within @xmath48 of the infrared peak at 1.6 @xmath6 m and overlaps the radio continuum source , which whiteoak & wilson ( 1990 ) estimate is @xmath49 in size at 6 ghz ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "we cautiously interpret the data for the maser in ngc4945 in terms of the paradigm established for ngc  4258 .",
    "the extensive data on ngc  4258 , with its clear keplerian signature , show that the masers define a nearly edge on thin annular disk . the data for ngc4945 are more sketchy but they share the characteristic of systemic emission bracketted roughly symmetrically in velocity _ and _ position by high - velocity emission .",
    "moreover , the angular distributions of blue - shifted emission is roughly linear and the velocities decline with angular distance from the systemic emission .",
    "however , the position errors are significant , the red - shifted emission does not appear to mirror this structure , the decline in velocity for the blue - shifted emission is faster than what is characteristic for a keplerian rotation curve , and the non - point source emission that seems to exist at some systemic and blue - shifted velocities could not be mapped ( figure  4 ) .",
    "nonetheless , there is a suggestion that the structures of ngc4945 and ngc4258 may be similar , and we proceed on that assumption .    in the context of an edge - on disk ,",
    "the observations suggest a binding mass ( for circular orbits ) of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the enclosed mass in units of m@xmath11 , @xmath52 is the orbital velocity in units of , @xmath53 is the distance in mpc , @xmath54 is the radius in mas , @xmath55 is inclination , and @xmath56 is the azimuthal angle of the red - shifted masers in the disk plane ( @xmath57 is the plane of the sky ) .",
    "the binding mass is @xmath58 m@xmath11 for @xmath59 , @xmath60 mas or 0.3 pc , and @xmath61 ( figure  4 ) .",
    "the implied mass density is @xmath62 m@xmath11 pc@xmath63 .",
    "the position angle of the disk , @xmath8 , is comparable to the position angle of the larger galactic disk , @xmath64 , and the senses of rotation of the two disks are the same .",
    "if the observed @xmath16 erg s@xmath17 x - ray luminosity ( @xcite ) implies a bolometric luminosity on the order of @xmath65 erg s@xmath17 , then the central engine radiates 10% of its eddington luminosity .",
    "we note that the shallow `` s '' the mappable maser emission traces may be consistent with a warp in the disk , which could be caused by radiation - driven torques that result from oblique illumination by the central engine ( @xcite ) , though this is not a definitive explanation .",
    "the interpretation of the observed maser structure is not unique and radically different interpretations might be viable . the emission could arise from a complex of star forming regions superposed on or within the nucleus , or from jet - induced shocks in the agn .",
    "the linear extent of the maser is comparable to galactic star formation complexes ( e.g. , w49n ) , although the velocity difference between the systemic and red - shifted features is large for adjacent star forming regions .",
    "maser emission can arise in warm gas behind dissociative shocks ( @xcite ) and nondissociative shocks ( @xcite ) , although the maser spectrum mandates a complex line - of - sight velocity structure for the shocks .",
    "interferometric synthesis observations will undoubtedly clarify the dynamical characteristics of the maser region , providing a comprehensive map of the maser emission within 200  of the systemic velocity .",
    "the dual nature of the nucleus , as both a starburst and a very heavily obscured seyfert object , makes this water maser source particularly important since it may be used to probe the dynamics and structure of the nucleus on sub - parsec scales .",
    "1 spectrum of the water maser emission from the nucleus of ngc4945 made on 1995 october 13 at the parkes radiotelescope of the csiro .",

    "the right ascension and declination offsets of the maser features , with respect to the reference , were determined from these curves .",
