    "we present the first analysis of the proton - air cross - section based on measurements made at the pierre auger observatory  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we analyse the shape of the distribution of the largest values of the depth of shower maximum , @xmath1 , the position at which an air shower deposits the maximum energy per unit of mass of atmosphere traversed .",
    "the _ tail _ of the @xmath1-distribution is sensitive to the proton - air cross - section , a fact first exploited in the pioneering work of the fly s eye collaboration  @xcite . to obtain accurate measurements of @xmath1 , timing data from the fluorescence telescopes",
    "is combined with that from the surface detector array for a precise hybrid reconstruction of the geometry of events  @xcite .",
    "we place particular emphasis on studying systematic uncertainties in the cross - section analysis .",
    "the unknown mass composition of cosmic - rays  @xcite is identified to be _ the _ major source of systematic uncertainty and accordingly the analysis has been optimised to minimise the impact of particles other than protons in the primary beam .",
    "this begins with restricting the analysis to the energy interval @xmath2 to @xmath3 , where the shape of the @xmath1-distribution is compatible with there being a substantial fraction of protons ; also there are a large number of events recorded in this energy range .",
    "the corresponding average center - of - mass energy of a proton interacting with a nucleon is , significantly above the reach of the large hadron collider .",
    "the proton - air cross - section is derived in a two - step process .",
    "firstly , we measure an air - shower observable with high sensitivity to the cross - section . secondly , we convert this measurement to a value of the proton - air cross - section for particle production ( c.f .",
    "this is the cross - section that accounts for all interactions which produce particles and thus contribute to the air - shower development ; it implicitly also includes diffractive interactions . as the primary observable we define @xmath4 via the exponential shape of the tail of the @xmath1-distribution , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the fraction of most deeply penetrating air showers used .",
    "considering only these events enhances the contribution of protons in the sample , since the depth at which proton - induced showers maximise is deeper in the atmosphere than for showers from heavier nuclei .",
    "thus , @xmath6 is a key parameter : a small value enhances the proton fraction , but reduces the number of events available for the analysis .",
    "we have chosen @xmath7 so that , for helium - fractions up to 25% , biases introduced by the possible presence of helium and heavier nuclei do not exceed the level of the statistical uncertainty .",
    "this was chosen after a monte carlo study that probed the sensitivity of the analysis to the mass composition depending on the choice of different values of  @xmath6 .",
    "we use events collected between 1 dec 2004 and 20 sept 2010 .",
    "the atmospheric and event - quality cuts applied are identical to those used for the analysis of @xmath8 and rms(@xmath9 )  @xcite yielding @xmath10 high - quality events .",
    "the @xmath1-distribution of these data is affected by the known geometrical acceptance of the fluorescence telescopes as well as by limitations related to atmospheric light transmission .",
    "we use the strategy developed for the measurement of @xmath11 and rms(@xmath1 ) to extract a sample that has an unbiased @xmath1-distribution : a fiducial volume selection , which requires event geometries that allow , for each individual shower , the complete observation of a defined slant depth range .",
    "firstly , we derive the range of values of @xmath1 that corresponds to the fraction @xmath7 of the most deeply penetrating showers .",
    "for this we need an unbiased distribution of @xmath1 over the entire depth range of observed values of @xmath1 . to achieve this",
    "we perform a fiducial event selection of the slant depth range containing 99.8% of the observed @xmath1-distribution , which corresponds to the range from @xmath12 to @xmath13{g / cm^{2}}$ ] .",
    "this reduces the data sample to @xmath14 events providing an unbiased @xmath1-distribution that is used to find the range of values of @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath7 , identified to extend from 768to 1004 .",
    "unbinned likelihood fit to obtain @xmath4 ( thick line ) .",
    "the @xmath1-distribution is unbiased by the fiducial geometry selection applied in the range of the fit . ]    secondly , we select those events from the original @xmath10 that have geometries allowing the complete observation of values of @xmath1 from 768to 1004 , the tail of the unbiased distribution . this fiducial cut maximises the statistics of an unbiased @xmath1-distribution in the range of interest . in total @xmath15 events",
    "pass the fiducial volume cuts , of which @xmath16 events have their @xmath1 in the selected range and thus contribute directly to the measurement of @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] we show the @xmath15 selected events and the result of an unbinned maximum likelihood fit of an exponential function over the range @xmath17 to @xmath13{g / cm^2}$ ] .",
    "values of @xmath4 have been re - calculated for sub - samples of the full dataset selected according to zenith - angle , shower - to - telescope distance and energy : the different values obtained for @xmath4 are consistent with statistical fluctuations .",
    "the re - analyses of the data for changes of fiducial event selection , modified values of @xmath6 and for different ranges of atmospheric depths yield changes of @xmath4 that are distributed around zero with a root - mean - square of @xmath18{\\gcm}$ ] .",
    "we use this root - mean - square as an estimate of the systematic uncertainties associated to the measurement .",
    "this yields @xmath19\\,\\gcm,\\ ] ] with the average energy of these events being @xmath20 .",
    "the differential energy distribution for these events follows a power - law with index @xmath21 .",
    "the average energy corresponds to a center - of - mass energy of @xmath22\\,$ ] in proton - proton collisions .",
    "the determination of the proton - air cross - section for particle production requires the use of air - shower simulations , which inherently introduces some dependence on model assumptions .",
    "we emulate the measurement of @xmath4 with monte carlo simulations to derive predictions of the slope , @xmath23 .",
    "it is known from previous work that the values of @xmath23 are directly linked to the hadronic cross - sections used in the simulations  @xcite .",
    "accordingly we can explore the effect of changing cross - sections empirically by multiplying all hadronic cross - sections input to the simulations by an energy - dependent factor  @xcite @xmath24{\\ev}\\right)}{\\lg\\left(\\unit[10^{19}]{\\ev}/\\unit[10^{15}]{\\ev}\\right ) } ,    \\label{eq : factor}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 denotes the shower energy and @xmath26 is the factor by which the cross - section is rescaled at @xmath27{\\ev}$ ] .",
    "this factor is unity below @xmath28{\\ev}$ ] reflecting the fact that measurements of the cross - section at the tevatron were used to tune the interaction models .",
    "this technique of modifying the original predictions of the cross - sections during the simulation process assures a smooth transition from accelerator data up to the energies of our analysis .    for each hadronic interaction model , the value of @xmath26",
    "is obtained that reproduces the measured value of @xmath4 .",
    "the modified cross - section is then deduced by multiplying the original cross - section used in the model by the factor @xmath29 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : factor ] ) using @xmath30 . for the conversion of @xmath4 into cross - section",
    ", we have used the four high - energy hadronic interaction models commonly adopted for air shower simulations : qgsjet01  @xcite , qgsjetii.3  @xcite , sibyll  2.1  @xcite and epos1.99  @xcite . while in general no model gives a completely accurate representation of cosmic - ray data in all respects ,",
    "these have been found to give reasonably good descriptions of many of the main features .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the differences between the models used in the analysis are typically bigger than the variations obtained within one model by parameter variation .",
    "therefore we use the model differences for estimating the systematic model dependence .",
    "the proton - air cross - sections for particle production derived for qgsjet01 , qgsjetii , sibyll and epos are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 mb respectively , with the statistical uncertainty for each of these values being @xmath35 mb . the difference of these cross - sections from the original model predictions are @xmath36% , with the exception of the result obtained with the sibyll model , which is @xmath37 smaller than the original sibyll prediction .",
    "we use the maximum deviations derived from using the four models , relative to the average result of @xmath38 mb , to estimate a systematic uncertainty of @xmath39 mb related to the difficulties of modelling high energy interactions .",
    "this procedure relies on the coverage of the underlying theoretical uncertainties by the available models .",
    "for example diffraction , fragmentation , inelastic intermediate states , nuclear effects , qcd saturation , etc .",
    "are all described at different levels using different phenomenological , but self - consistent , approaches in these models .",
    "it is thus possible that the true range of the uncertainties for air - shower analyses is larger , but this can not be estimated with these models .",
    "furthermore , certain features of hadronic particle production , such as the multiplicity , elasticity and pion - charge ratio , have an especially important impact on air shower development  @xcite ; of these we found that only the elasticity can have a relevant impact on @xmath4 .",
    "the previously identified systematic uncertainty of @xmath39 mb induced by the modelling of hadronic interactions , corresponds to the impact of modifying the elasticity within @xmath40 in the models .",
    "the selection of events with large values of @xmath1 also enhances the fraction of primary cosmic - ray interactions with smaller multiplicities and larger elasticities , which is for example characteristic for diffractive interactions .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is thus more sensitive to the cross - section of those interactions . the identified model - dependence for the determination of @xmath41 is also caused by the compensation of this effect .",
    "also the choice of a logarithmic energy dependence for the rescaling - factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : factor ] ) may affect the resulting cross - sections .",
    "however , since the required rescaling - factors are small , this can only be a marginal effect .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of 22%  @xcite in the absolute value of the energy scale leads to systematic uncertainties of 7 mb in the cross - section and @xmath42 in the center - of - mass energy .",
    "furthermore , the procedure to obtain @xmath43 from the measured @xmath4 depends on additional parameters . by varying the energy distribution , energy and @xmath1 resolution in the simulations , we find that related systematic changes of the value of @xmath43 are distributed with a root - mean - square of @xmath44{mb}$ ] around zero .",
    "we use the root - mean - square as estimate of the systematic uncertainties related to the conversion of @xmath4 to @xmath41 .",
    ".[tab : syst]summary of the systematic uncertainties . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the presence of photons in the primary beam would bias the measurement .",
    "the average @xmath1 of showers produced by photons at the energies of interest is about @xmath45{g / cm^2}$ ] deeper in the atmosphere than that of protons .",
    "however , observational limits on the fraction of photons are @xmath46%  @xcite . with simulations",
    "we find that the possible under - estimation of the cross - section if photons were present in the data sample at this level is less than 10 mb .    resulting @xmath47 compared to other measurements  ( see  @xcite for references ) and model predictions .",
    "the inner error bars are statistical , while the outer include systematic uncertainties for a helium fraction of 25% and 10 mb for the systematic uncertainty attributed to the fraction of photons . ]    with the present limitations of observations , we can not distinguish air showers produced by helium nuclei from those created by protons . from simulations we find that @xmath41 is over - estimated depending on the percentages of helium in the data sample .",
    "lack of knowledge of the helium fraction is the dominant source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "we also find that the nuclei of the cno - group introduce no bias for fractions up to @xmath48% , and accordingly we assign no uncertainty in the cross - section due to these or heavier nuclei .    in table  [",
    "tab : syst ] we list the sources of systematic uncertainties . as the helium fraction is not known we show the impact of 10 , 25 and 50% of helium respectively . in what follows",
    "we include a systematic uncertainty related to a helium fraction of 25% . in the extreme case ,",
    "were the cosmic - ray composition to be 100% helium , the analysis would over - estimate the proton - air cross - section by 300 to 500 mb .",
    "given the constraints from accelerator data at lower energies and typical model assumptions , this extreme scenario is not realistic .",
    "we summarise our results by averaging the four values of the cross - section obtained with the hadronic interaction models to give @xmath49 \\,\\rm{mb}\\ ] ] at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath50 $ ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] we compare this result with model predictions and other measurements .",
    "the measurements at the highest energies are : hires  @xcite and fly s eye  @xcite that are both based on @xmath1 , yakutsk array  @xcite using cherenkov observations and akeno  @xcite measuring electron and muon numbers at ground level .",
    "all these analyses assume a pure proton composition .",
    "in the context of a possible mixed - mass cosmic - ray composition , this can lead to large systematic effects .",
    "also all these analyses are based on a single interaction model for describing air showers : only hires uses a second model for systematic checks .",
    "it is one of the prime aims of our analysis to have the smallest possible sensitivity to a non - proton component , and to perform a detailed systematic analysis on the uncertainties related to the mass composition .",
    "we also use , for the first time , all hadronic interaction models currently available for the estimation of model - related systematic effects .",

    "for the purpose of making comparisons with accelerator data we calculate the inelastic and total proton - proton cross - sections using the glauber model .",

    "we use a value of @xmath56 that is determined from measurements of the single - diffractive cross - section , as well as from proton - carbon cross - section data at lower energies .",

    ", this applies to the elastic slope parameter , @xmath51 , ( defined by @xmath57 for very small @xmath58 ) , the correlation of @xmath51 to the cross - section , and the cross - section for diffractive dissociation . for the example of @xmath59 , the correlation of @xmath51 with the cross - section",

    "these three independent contributions are 1 , 3 , 5 , and 4 mb respectively . for the total cross - section ,",
    "they are 13 , 6 , 5 , and 4 mb .",
    "we emphasize that the total theoretical uncertainty of converting the proton - air to a proton - proton cross - section may be larger than estimated here within the glauber model .",
    "there are other extensions of the glauber model to account for inelastic screening  @xcite or nucleon - nucleon correlations @xcite , and alternative approaches that include , for example , parton saturation or other effects @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] we compare our inelastic cross - section result to accelerator data and to the cross - sections used in the hadronic interaction models .",

    "we have studied in detail the effects of assumptions on the primary cosmic - ray mass composition , hadronic interaction models , simulation settings and the fiducial volume limits of the telescopes on the final result . by analysing only the most deeply penetrating events we selected a data sample enriched in protons .",
    "the results are presented assuming a maximum contamination of 25% of helium in the light cosmic - ray mass component .",

    "we convert the proton - air production cross - section into the total , and the inelastic , proton - proton cross - section using a glauber calculation that includes intermediate inelastic screening corrections . in this calculation",
    "we use the correlation between the elastic slope parameter and the proton - proton cross - sections taken from the interaction models as a constraint .",
    "we find that the inelastic proton - proton cross - section depends less on the elastic slope parameter than does the total proton - proton cross - section , and thus the systematic uncertainty of the glauber calculation for the inelastic result is smaller .",
