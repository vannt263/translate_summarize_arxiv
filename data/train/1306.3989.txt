    "the aim of this study is to pin down the properties and statistics of supersonic , compressible turbulence .",
    "this kind of turbulence is relevant for the highly compressible interstellar medium @xcite , because it controls the rate of star formation triggered by gas compression in shocks @xcite , affects the star formation efficiency @xcite , and determines the mass distribution of stars when they are born @xcite .",
    "supersonic turbulence also has an important effect on the gravitational instability of galactic discs @xcite .",
    "even the early universe was likely dominated by supersonic turbulence when the first cosmic haloes started to contract to form the first galaxies @xcite .",
    "analytic models of star formation are based upon the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the gas density and the scaling of the velocity spectrum in supersonic turbulence .",
    "it is thus crucial to determine the pdf and the scaling with high precision and to test whether these are universal in any kind of supersonically turbulent flow or whether they depend on the driving of the turbulence .",
    "it is important to study the influence of the driving mode , because interstellar turbulence is likely driven by a combination of different stirring mechanisms , all leading to potentially different excitation states and mode mixtures . driving mechanisms for interstellar turbulence include supernova explosions and expanding , ionizing shells from previous cycles of star formation @xcite , gravitational collapse and accretion of material @xcite , and galactic spiral - arm compression of hi clouds @xcite , as well as magneto - rotational instability @xcite .",
    "wind , jets and outflows from young stellar objects have also been suggested to drive turbulence on smaller scales @xcite .",
    "turbulence in high - redshift galaxies is probably generated during the collapse of primordial haloes and later by the feedback from the first stars @xcite .",
    "many of the aforementioned driving mechanisms for interstellar turbulence directly compress the gas ( which we call ` compressive driving ' ) , while others primarily excite vortices ( called ` solenoidal driving ' ) .",
    "mathematically , we distinguish those two extreme cases by defining a vector field @xmath11 that drives the turbulence @xcite :    * solenoidal driving ( @xmath12 ) , and * compressive driving ( @xmath13 ) .    in reality",
    ", we expect a mixture of both , some mechanisms will be closer to our idealized picture of solenoidal driving , while others might be closer to compressive driving .",
    "unlike the extensively studied case of incompressible turbulence led by the pioneering theoretical work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k41 ) , studies of highly supersonic turbulent flows only recently started to shed light on the basic statistics of supersonic turbulent flows .",
    "because of its complexity and three - dimensional nature , the properties of supersonic , compressible turbulence are primarily investigated through numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "early studies @xcite indicated that compressible turbulence might exhibit a turbulent velocity spectrum @xmath14 very similar to the phenomenological theory of incompressible turbulence by kolmogorov with @xmath15 ( k41 , * ? ? ? * ) . here",
    ", @xmath16 is the turbulent gas velocity and @xmath17 is the wavenumber ( or inverse length - scale @xmath18 ) of a turbulent fluctuation ( sometimes called ` eddy ' ) .",
    "the resolution of these early simulations , however , did not yield a significant inertial range ( the scaling range over which a power law in wavenumber space can be measured which is well separated from both the driving and the viscous scales ) , and the turbulence was only mildly compressible .    with the advent of supercomputers combining thousands of compute cores in one large - scale parallel application , it is only recently that the spectral scaling of supersonic turbulence could be measured with improved precision @xcite , indicating @xmath2 , which is much steeper than the kolmogorov spectrum and closer to burgers turbulence @xcite .",
    "burgers turbulence consists of a network of discontinuities ( shocks ) , which can only form in supersonic flows .",
    "however , the studies by @xcite and @xcite were limited to @xmath19 grid cells .",
    "the highest resolution simulation of supersonic turbulence so far was done by @xcite for a moderate mach number of 6 .",
    "although this is clearly in the supersonic regime , typical molecular clouds in the milky way have mach numbers of about and sizes in the range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". they can thus be significantly more compressible .",
    "here we focus on the most compressible type of clouds in the milky way and compare simulations with mach 17 turbulence . @xcite only studied solenoidal ( divergence - free ) driving , while here we study both extremes : solenoidal and compressive ( curl - free ) driving , in order to test the influence of different driving modes .",
    "we find significantly different statistics for these two extreme cases .",
    "first , we briefly summarize our limited theoretical knowledge of supersonic turbulence in section  [ sec : theory ] . in section  [ sec : methods ] , we then turn to the numerical simulation techniques used to compare to and test these theories .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents our results with details on the vorticity production and spatial structure of supersonic turbulence , the density pdf , and finally the scaling of the power spectrum .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "studying turbulence requires a sufficient scale separation between energy injection ( driving ) on large scales and dissipation on small scales .",
    "the range in between is known as the inertial range of turbulence with a constant energy flux , where the flow is directly influenced neither by driving nor by dissipation . the existence of an inertial range is well established for incompressible turbulence @xcite . however",
    ", this may not be the case for supersonic turbulence .",
    "it is only recently that @xcite have rigorously proven the existence of an inertial range for highly compressible turbulence produced by any type of driving mechanism , solenoidal or compressive .",
    "the existence of such an inertial range , however , does not exclude the possibility of different scaling properties for solenoidal or compressive driving , which we will test below .",
    "a fundamental idea for the scaling of supersonic turbulence was proposed by @xcite and later refined by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . based on the dimensional analysis by k41 and the assumption of a constant flux of the kinetic energy density , @xmath20 in the inertial range",
    ", we can write @xmath21 the second proportionality implies a time - scale @xmath22 for energy transfer on scale @xmath18 .",
    "the last , enforced equality in equation  ( [ eq : flux ] ) is that of a constant energy flux and is the same as that assumed in k41 , only that we keep the dependence on density @xmath23 , while @xmath24 in the incompressible model by k41 . taking this last equality in equation  ( [ eq : flux ] ) , we find that the third - order structure function of the density - weighted velocity , @xmath25 , scales linearly , @xmath26 , for an increment @xmath27 between two points separated by a distance @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the original kolmogorov scaling for the power spectrum @xmath28 would be preserved even for highly compressible turbulence , if the density - weighted velocity @xmath29 were taken instead of the pure velocity @xmath16 . indeed , numerical simulations with with mach numbers of and resolutions of @xmath19 grid cells , using solenoidal or weakly compressive driving , indicate a @xmath29 scaling consistent with @xmath30 @xcite , even if a magnetic field is included @xcite .",
    "however , the simulation with purely compressive driving by @xcite indicated a significantly steeper scaling with @xmath31 in the inertial range .    while this last result might be regarded as a false alarm , because of a limited or insufficient scaling range in simulations with purely compressive driving as argued by @xcite , recently , @xcite derived an exact relation for the scaling of compressible isothermal turbulence , which does exactly predict @xmath32 .",
    "their model is also based on @xmath29 and the predicted @xmath9 scaling applies for turbulence with a very strong @xmath10 component , such as produced by compressive driving . only around the sonic scale , where the local mach number drops to unity , would the spectrum approach @xmath30 .",
    "the central result in @xcite is an exact relation for compressible turbulence ( their equation  11 ) .",
    "it has two contributions to the total energy injection or dissipation rate @xmath33 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the energy flux as a function of length - scale @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a new term that vanishes for incompressible turbulence and contains the contributions of @xmath10 . using the general definition of the increment @xmath38 of any given variable @xmath39 at position @xmath40 and separated by a distance @xmath36 , the exact expression for the new term @xmath41 is @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denotes an average over all positions @xmath40 in the turbulent flow .",
    "assuming isotropy ( which is typically fulfilled , at least in a statistical sense ) and integrating over a sphere with radius @xmath36 , equation  ( [ eq : gb11exact ] ) can be written as @xmath47 with an effective dissipation rate @xmath48 to first order in a taylor expansion of @xmath37 for sufficiently small @xmath36 , but still larger than the viscous scale to probe the scaling in the inertial range ( see equation  15 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    following dimensional analysis , the flux @xmath49 . introducing again the density - weighted velocity @xmath50",
    ", we find @xmath51 and thus the spectrum of the density - weighted velocity @xmath52 if @xmath53 , then the spectrum @xmath30 is expected to follow k41 scaling as argued in our previous derivation above ( equation  [ eq : k07scaling ] ) .",
    "if , however , @xmath54 scales with @xmath36 to some power , then @xmath5 does not follow @xmath7 , but is modified by the scaling of @xmath55 according to equation  ( [ eq : vareps ] ) .",
    "it is thus the additional term @xmath37 in the derivation of @xcite that can lead to a modified scaling of @xmath5 .",
    "finally , @xcite argue that one may expect a scaling @xmath56 for turbulence with a strong @xmath10 component ( see the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath10 in equation  [ eq : gb11s ] ) , in which case we would obtain @xmath9 according to equation  ( [ eq : gb11scaling ] ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we run and analyse two extremely high - resolution simulations of supersonic turbulence with solenoidal and compressive driving to test the prediction of @xmath9 by @xcite .",
    "we do this here for compressive driving at a very high mach number ( @xmath57 ) , such that @xmath10 is potentially very strong on certain scales in the turbulent flow .",
    "we also analyse how @xmath10 depends on the driving mode .",
    "a direct measurement of the new term @xmath41 is beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented in a future study with focus on the analysis of structure functions .",
    "here we concentrate on the scaling inferred by fourier analysis .",

    "we use the flash code @xcite in its current version ( v4 ) to solve the compressible gas - dynamical equations on three - dimensional , uniform , periodic grids of fixed side length @xmath58 with resolutions of @xmath0 , @xmath59 , @xmath19 , @xmath60 , and @xmath1 grid points . to guarantee stability and accuracy of the numerical solution of the euler equations , we use the hll5r positive - definite riemann solver @xcite ,",
    "closed with an isothermal equation of state , which is a reasonable approximation for dense , molecular gas of solar metallicity , over a wide range of densities @xcite .",
    "keeping the gas temperature fixed has also the desirable advantage that the sound speed @xmath61 in the medium is fixed and thus the root - mean - square ( rms ) mach number @xmath62 does not change systematically for a constant kinetic energy injection rate of the turbulence .",

    "@xmath11 only contains large - scale modes , @xmath64 , where most of the power is injected at the @xmath65 mode in fourier space , i.e. , on half of the box size ( for simplicity , we will drop the wavenumber unit @xmath66 in the following )",

    "this projection allows us to construct a solenoidal ( divergence - free ) or compressive ( curl - free ) acceleration field by setting @xmath72 or @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "our aim here is to study the regime of _ highly supersonic turbulence _ such as in the interstellar medium , so we chose to drive the turbulence to @xmath74 for both extreme cases of driving ( solenoidal and compressive ) , which means that all the scales resolved in our calculations are in the supersonic regime , i.e. , above the sonic scale @xcite . assuming a power - law velocity scaling of the turbulence , @xmath75 , the sonic scale @xmath76 ( where the scale - dependent mach number , has dropped to unity ) can be estimated as @xmath77 because the mach number on the injection scale is roughly equal to the rms mach number , @xmath78 . with @xmath74 , @xmath65 , and @xmath79 ( the approximate velocity scaling for supersonic turbulence found in * ? ? ?",

    "thus , any resolved scales in our calculations are in the truly supersonic regime of turbulence , so we can exclude any potential contamination of the inferred supersonic scaling exponents by a transition region to subsonic flow around the sonic scale , because that transition region is on much smaller scales than we analyse here . a list of all numerical models and parameters is provided in table  [ tab : sims ] .",
    "in the following , we will primarily focus on comparing two simulations with solenoidal and compressive driving , each with a grid resolution of @xmath1 points , which is currently the world s largest data set of supersonic turbulence ( an equivalent resolution was so far only reached for incompressible turbulence by * ? ? ?",
    "each simulation was run for about 44,000 time steps ( see appendix  [ app : vpdfs ] ) on 32,768 compute cores running in parallel on supermuc at the leibniz rechenzentrum in garching ( which consumed about 7.2 million cpu hours altogether ) .",
    "each run produced @xmath81 of data ( 51 double - precision snapshots of the turbulent density and three - dimensional velocity , stretched over six turbulent turnover times ) . in order to study resolution effects",
    ", we also compare each @xmath1 model with the respective lower - resolution versions with @xmath60 , @xmath19 , @xmath59 , and @xmath0 compute cells ( see table  [ tab : sims ] for a complete list of simulations ) .          for all but the @xmath1 simulations , we start with gas of initial velocity @xmath82 and homogeneous density @xmath83 in a three - dimensional periodic box .",
    "the driving then accelerates the gas to our target mach number , @xmath74 , until a statistically converged regime of fully developed turbulent flow is reached , which happens after about two turnover times , @xmath84 . for",
    "the @xmath1 runs , we take the density and velocity fields of the respective @xmath60 simulations at @xmath85 and map them on @xmath1 grids to spare the initial transient start - up phase , @xmath86 .",
    "we run them until @xmath87 , which gives us a sufficiently large statistical sample of independent flow snapshots to obtain converged results . in order to allow the turbulence to adjust to the new resolution and to converge to a statistically steady state , we start analysing the results for @xmath88 , leaving us five turnover times ( @xmath89 ) to average pdfs and fourier spectra .",
    "this procedure also allows us to quantify the temporal variations of the turbulence in the fully developed regime .    to demonstrate statistical convergence within , we show the time evolution of the rms mach number and the mean vorticity magnitude , @xmath90 , in figure  [ fig : tevol ] for all resolutions with solenoidal driving ( left - hand panels ) and with compressive driving ( right - hand panels ) .",
    "we see that both @xmath62 and the vorticity grow quickly within @xmath84 and then reach a statistically steady state .",
    "the @xmath1 runs , which were initialized with the @xmath60 density and velocity fields at @xmath85 , reach a steady state by @xmath91 , so we choose to start averaging pdfs and spectra for @xmath88 , when all statistics have safely reached a steady state .",
    "( we also inspected the time evolution of the rms velocity divergence , as well as the time evolution of fourier spectra shown in section  [ sec : spectra ] , all of which were statistically converged for @xmath88 . )    figure  [ fig : tevol ] shows that both extreme types of driving generate vorticity , with solenoidal driving being about twice as efficient .",
    "this is because solenoidal motions are directly injected by solenoidal driving , while they have to self - generate in shock collisions and by viscous interactions across density gradients with subsequent amplification in the case of purely compressive driving ( for details of the  anti - diffusion  term responsible for this behaviour , see the vorticity equations in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    since the overall vorticity is always dominated by small - scale structures , which have the smallest turbulent time - scales , @xmath92 for any @xmath93 ( e.g. , @xmath94 for kolmogorov and @xmath95 for burgers turbulence as reasonable limiting cases ) , increasing the resolution leads to higher levels of vorticity , as the effective viscosity of the gas decreases and the effective reynolds number increases @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the vorticity tends to infinity at a finite time in the limit of zero viscosity @xcite .",
    "the effective reynolds numbers of our simulations are of the order of @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "for burgers turbulence with @xmath95 and for a grid resolution of @xmath97 , this yields @xmath98 .",

    "corresponding projections ( integration along the line of sight ) of the density and the mass - weighted vorticity are shown in figure  [ fig : images_proj ] .",
    "the latter is closer to what an observer would see in a molecular cloud observation .",
    "the gas density and vorticity appear to be correlated for both driving types in the slices and in the projections .",
    "this is because vorticity is primarily generated in shocks and across strong density gradients @xcite .",
    "solenoidal driving produces more space - filling structures with a fractal dimension @xmath99 , while @xmath100 and thus closer to sheets for purely compressive driving @xcite .",
    "the latter is consistent with the fractal mass dimension inferred for molecular clouds in the milky way @xcite and in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "dense structures with high levels of vorticity are confined to relatively small patches in the case of purely compressive driving .",
    "some large - scale regions with sizes of about @xmath101 or @xmath102 remain almost empty and exhibit very low gas density and vorticity .",
    "however , structures on smaller scales ( @xmath103 ) do show high levels of vorticity throughout .",
    "this indicates that the inertial range in @xmath74 turbulence with compressive driving starts on somewhat smaller scales than with purely solenoidal driving @xcite , which is different from the case of mildly supersonic turbulence with @xcite , where the inertial - range extent is not significantly different between solenoidal and compressive driving .",
    "the strong density variations in supersonic turbulence , such as seen in figures  [ fig : images ] and  [ fig : images_proj ] , are clearly the most prominent difference to incompressible turbulence . to quantify these , we briefly analyse the pdf of the gas density .",
    "the volume - weighted density pdfs of the logarithmic density @xmath104 are shown in figure  [ fig : pdfs ] .",
    "obviously , compressive driving produces a significantly wider density distribution with a larger standard deviation than solenoidal driving for the same rms mach number , which has been explored and discussed in detail in previous studies @xcite .",
    "previous works suggest that the density pdf should be approximately log - normal @xcite",
    ". deviations from perfectly log - normal distributions are caused by intermittency and sampling effects @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested an intermittency fit for the volume - weighted pdf with the following function ,    @xmath105\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{\\theta^2\\,\\omega(s)}}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ \\lambda\\equiv{\\sigma_s}^2/(2 \\theta^2),\\quad\\omega(s)\\equiv\\lambda/(1 + \\theta)-s/ \\theta \\;\\ ; ( \\omega\\geq0)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath106 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : pdffit ] ) is motivated and explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "it contains two parameters , the standard deviation of logarithmic density variations , @xmath107 , and an intermittency parameter @xmath108 . in the zero - intermittency limit @xmath109 ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : pdffit ] ) simplifies to a log - normal pdf .",
    "@xcite show that this intermittency form of the pdf provides excellent fits to density pdfs from turbulence simulations with extremely different properties ( solenoidal , mixed , and compressive driving , mach numbers from 0.1 to 18 , and varying degrees of magnetization ) .",
    "we apply fits to all pdfs in figure  [ fig : pdfs ] for different driving and resolutions by simultaneously fitting the standard deviation @xmath107 and the intermittency parameter @xmath110 , i.e. , we perform a two - parameter fit .",
    "we note that this yields fitted values of @xmath107 that agree very well with the actual data values ( to within 10% ) .",

    "our fit values for the infinite - resolution limit in figure  [ fig : pdfconv ] show that compressive driving is significantly more intermittent with @xmath120 , consistent with the fits in @xcite for @xmath121 simulations with solenoidal and compressive driving by @xcite .",
    "fourier power spectra are an ideal tool to study the scaling of fluid variables such as the turbulent velocity , density , or combinations of both , and the results are readily comparable to turbulence theories such as the incompressible ( * ? ? ?",

    "an important caveat of numerical turbulence simulations is that the fourier spectra are typically only converged within a very tiny range of scales for the resolutions achievable with current technology ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "thus , a large fraction of scales is either affected by numerical dissipation ( and thus not converged ) or a potential inertial range is contaminated by the so - called bottleneck effect @xcite .",
    "scales affected by numerical dissipation and the bottleneck effect must be excluded from the analysis .",
    "previous simulations established very stringent requirements on the numerical resolution . for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite find that at least a resolution of @xmath59 grid cells is required , but even with a resolution of @xmath19 grid cells , the scaling range is much less than half a decade .",

    "thus , we have to resolve structures that are @xmath148 times smaller compared to @xcite , which is about the difference in the required resolution , i.e. , @xmath149 is a factor of 8 in linear resolution , equivalent to the reduction in shock width between mach 6 and mach 17 turbulence .    from this analysis , we see that at least a resolution of @xmath1 grid cells is required to resolve the inertial range for supersonic turbulence with a higher mach number ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "even with such high resolution , the inertial range only extends between @xmath147 and @xmath135 .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath5 spectrum for compressive driving would have been consistent with the universal hypothesis of @xmath7 scaling , if we had only resolved it up to @xmath19 grid cells ( see the relatively flat dashed and dot - dashed lines for @xmath59 and @xmath19 resolutions in the bottom , right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : spect ] ) . in contrast , the additional @xmath60 and @xmath1 calculations clearly demonstrate a significant steepening to @xmath9 in the scaling range @xmath132 , before @xmath5 flattens again for @xmath150 due to bottleneck contamination there .",
    "the steepening to @xmath151 is basically absent for resolutions @xmath152 , because the bottleneck effect artificially flattens the spectra , i.e. , we would have measured a shallower slope closer to @xmath7 , if we had included scales in the fit that are affected by the bottleneck effect .",
    "thus , for fitting the spectra , great care must be exercised in choosing converged scales that reflect the physical scaling of supersonic turbulence , which requires extremely high resolution for @xmath153 turbulence , such as in many molecular clouds .",
    "given all statistical and numerical uncertainties , and given the systematic evolution of the spectra with increasing resolution in figure  [ fig : spect ] , our measured slopes for the @xmath1 models are converged to within an uncertainty of @xmath154 , which we estimated by extrapolating the slopes for @xmath19 , @xmath60 , and @xmath1 resolutions to the limit of infinite resolution ( the temporal variations are of the order of @xmath155 ) .",
    "varying the fit range arbitrarily between @xmath136 and @xmath156 ( given the constraint that @xmath157 ) changes the measured slopes by less than @xmath158 .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 slopes are significantly different between solenoidal and compressive driving .        to see that the slopes of the @xmath5 spectra are also converged in time , we fit each individual flow snapshot within the fully developed regime of turbulence .",
    "this analysis is shown in figure  [ fig : spectevol ] , demonstrating convergence and emphasizing our main result : the spectral slope of the density - weighted velocity @xmath29 is @xmath159 , only slightly steeper than k41 scaling , while compressive driving yields a significantly steeper slope of @xmath160 , consistent with the theoretical prediction in @xcite .",
    "the reason for the dependence of @xmath5 on the driving that we found above can be seen in the theoretical derivation by @xcite of the scaling in equation  ( [ eq : gb11scaling ] ) .",
    "this derivation shows that @xmath161 . since @xmath162 ,",
    "exactly defined in equation  ( [ eq : gb11s ] ) , @xmath54 is not constant , but instead modifies the scaling of @xmath5 .",
    "preliminary analyses of structure functions ( not shown here ) indicate a positive power - law scaling of @xmath41 , such that the effect of the new ( compressible ) term @xmath41 is to _ steepen _ the slope of @xmath5 compared to k41 scaling with @xmath7 . such a steepening is indeed seen in the numerical spectra in figure  [ fig : spect ] with @xmath163 and @xmath164 for solenoidal and compressive driving , respectively .",
    "the stronger steepening for compressive driving is caused by the stronger @xmath10 component for this type of driving ( see equation  [ eq : gb11s ] for the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath10 ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the scaling of the term @xmath37 is beyond the scope of this study , but we can nevertheless quantify the amount of compression and @xmath10 , causing the modified scaling of @xmath5 . to study the effects of compression , we first consider the compressive ratio spectrum , @xmath165 i.e. , the ratio of the longitudinal part of the velocity spectrum @xmath166 ( for which @xmath167 is parallel to @xmath168 ) divided by the total velocity spectrum @xmath14 .",
    "the compressive ratio is a useful measure to evaluate the fraction of compressible velocity fluctuations as a function of scale .",
    "it is shown in figure  [ fig : spect_divv ] ( top panels ) .",
    "we clearly see the effect of the distinct driving at @xmath169 .",
    "solenoidal driving does not excite compressible modes directly , producing a minimum in @xmath170 ( note that this is not exactly zero , because some compression is indirectly induced at @xmath169 , because the flow is supersonic ) . in contrast , compressive driving excites only compressible modes at @xmath169 and @xmath171 ( it is also not exactly unity , because of indirect production of solenoidal modes in shock collisions and along density gradients ) .",
    "however , the _ direct _ effect of the driving is only noticeable on scales @xmath172 ( see section  [ sec : methods ] ) . yet",
    ", we will see below that the driving does _ indirectly _ change the statistics in the inertial range of compressible turbulence , as the supersonic turbulent fluctuations cascade down to smaller scales .",
    "figure  [ fig : spect_divv ] ( top panels ) shows that the compressive ratio @xmath173 decreases from about 1/3 to 1/4 for solenoidal driving in the inertial range , consistent with @xcite , but remains almost constant at @xmath174 for compressive driving up to @xmath175 , where the scaling is nearly converged with resolution ( higher wave numbers , @xmath176 , are affected by numerical dissipation and the bottleneck effect as explained above , and were thus excluded from the fit ) .",
    "this emphasizes the very different nature of supersonic turbulence driven by a solenoidal force and driven by a compressive force .",
    "in contrast to the classical concept of incompressible turbulence with an inertial range that does not depend on the driving , we see here that the inertial - range scaling of compressible turbulence depends on the driving .",
    "consistent with the compressive ratio spectrum , also @xmath177 has a significant dependence on the driving as shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : spect_divv ] .",
    "@xmath178 decreases in the inertial range for solenoidal driving .",
    "remarkably though , for compressive driving , @xmath177 remains constant over an extremely extended range of scales .",
    "we believe that this is the key reason for the different scaling of the @xmath29 spectra . a quantitative analysis , however , requires a direct measurement of the scaling of @xmath179 , which must be done in a follow - up study .",
    "we studied the statistics of isothermal , highly compressible , supersonic ( mach 17 ) turbulence , such as relevant for the dynamics of the interstellar medium , with the mach numbers of the order of in the nearly isothermal density regime of molecular clouds .",
    "we analysed simulations with resolutions of grid cells to study the convergence of our results .",
    "comparing the two limiting cases of turbulent driving : ( 1 ) by a solenoidal ( divergence - free ) force , and ( 2 ) by a compressive ( curl - free ) force , we find significant differences in the production of vorticity , the density pdf , and the scaling of the turbulence in the inertial range .",
    "the vorticity produced by solenoidal driving is about @xmath180 larger than by compressive driving , close to the hypersonic limit ( figure  [ fig : tevol ] ) .",
    "the turbulent structures , in particular the density structures , exhibit significantly different fractal dimensions for solenoidal and compressive driving ( figures  [ fig : images ] and  [ fig : images_proj ] ) . for resolutions ,",
    "the density pdfs are converged to within 20% of the infinite - resolution limit , while simulations with @xmath181 resolution can deviate by more than a factor of two from the infinite resolution limit ( figures  [ fig : pdfs ] and  [ fig : pdfconv ] ) .",
    "compressive driving is more intermittent than solenoidal driving , with the pdf intermittency parameter @xmath120 .",
    "the pure velocity spectra are close to burgers scaling with @xmath2 for both driving cases .",
    "in contrast , we find that the previously suggested universal scaling of the density - weighted velocity @xmath29 is ruled out ( see figures  [ fig : spect ] and  [ fig : spectevol ] ) .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath182 , close to ( but slightly steeper than ) k41 scaling ( @xmath140 ) for solenoidal driving , is consistent with previous studies .",
    "however , @xmath5 is significantly steeper for compressive driving with @xmath183 in the inertial range .",
    "the latter is in excellent agreement with the theoretical estimate @xmath184 by @xcite for highly compressible turbulence with a strong @xmath10 component , which we find to decrease for solenoidal driving , but stays almost perfectly constant for compressive driving down to very small scales ( figure  [ fig : spect_divv ] ) .",
    "our study emphasizes the need to rethink the definition of the inertial - range scaling in highly compressible turbulence compared to incompressible turbulence .",
    "the latter defines an inertial range on scales sufficiently separated from the driving and dissipation scales , such that there is no influence of driving and dissipation .",
    "this basic rule can not be carried over to highly compressible , supersonic turbulence , where the inertial - range scaling does depend on the driving , as we have shown here .",
    "this may be caused by supersonic turbulent fluctuations ( shocks ) crossing multiple scales , in contrast to the more local energy transfer between scales in incompressible turbulence . answering this question",
    "requires a scale - by - scale analysis of the energy transfer tensor with high - resolution data in future studies .",
    "the author thanks hussein aluie , supratik banerjee , sebastien galtier , ralf klessen , lukas konstandin , alexei kritsuk , paolo padoan , alessandro romeo , and rahul shetty for stimulating discussions .",
    "an independent bayesian analysis of the fourier spectra by lukas konstandin is greatly appreciated .",

    "the standard deviation of the @xmath16-pdf is practically identical to the rms mach number , because the mean time - averaged velocity ( and the mean momentum ) is zero to machine precision .    given these maximum velocities @xmath186 , typical time steps for the simulations with @xmath97 are @xmath187 for @xmath188 and the cfl safety factor @xmath189 @xcite . the total number of time steps to evolve the simulations for six turbulent crossing times @xmath190 , where @xmath191 , is thus @xmath192 .",
