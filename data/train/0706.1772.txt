    "it has long been known that the plasma emitting gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) must be moving relativistically , and that its lorentz factor @xmath1 is much larger than unity .",
    "this follows by the so - called compactness argument @xcite .",
    "the high photon densities , coupled with the short variability timescales , imply that grb sources should be optically thick to pair production , leading to a huge suppression of the emitted flux and to thermal spectra , contrary to what is observed .",
    "the solution to the compactness problem requires the source to be in relativistic motion @xcite .",
    "lower limits to the lorentz factor @xmath2 are usually derived @xcite .",
    "the discovery of long - lived afterglows has greatly advanced our knowledge of grbs .",
    "afterglow radation is powered by the deceleration of the relativistic fireball .",
    "the afterglow behaviour at late times , however , is insensitive to the initial lorentz factor , since the fireball decelerates in a self - similar way @xcite .",
    "the fireball lorentz factor can be measured by observing the afterglow onset @xcite , which roughly corresponds to the time at which the fireball starts decelerating significantly . at this time , the afterglow luminosity reaches a maximum .",
    "unluckily , the early light curves are very complex , and the observed emission is a mixture of several components , which easily hide the afterglow peak : residual prompt activity , reverse shocks , late internal shocks , reverberberation of the main grb .",
    "a clear peak could be observed in very few cases , most noticeably grb030418 and grb050820a @xcite .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite triggered on the long - duration grb060418 and grb060607a , promptly located them , and for both discovered an x - ray and optical afterglow ( falcone et al .",
    "2006 ; ziaeepour et al .",
    "their redshifts are @xmath3 and 3.082 , respectively , thus implying an isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath4 and @xmath5 erg @xcite .",
    "the x - ray telescope followed their light curve for a few days , revealing intense flares for both .",
    "the rem ( rapid eye mount ) robotic telescope @xcite promptly reacted to the triggers , and started observing the grb fields about one minute after the grb , locating in both cases a near - infrared ( nir ) counterpart @xcite . in the case of grb060418",
    ", multifilter observations were secured to study the afterglow spectrum , while for grb060607a a single , densely sampled light curve was recorded .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a full description of these data .",
    "figure  [ fg : lcs ] shows the light curves of grb060418 and grb060607a . in the nir , a clear peak",
    "is observed @xmath6  s after the trigger .",
    "following the maximum , the curves evolve gradually into a power - law decay .",
    "this is different from what observed in the x rays , where the flares are observed superimposed to an underlying component with power - law behaviour . for grb060418 ,",
    "the decay goes on interrupted for more than three decades in time , directly linking the peak to the forward shock emission .",
    "these properties suggest that the observed maximum corresponds to the afterglow onset .",
    "the peak times were quantitatively determined by fitting a smoothly - broken power law to the light curve .",
    "the observed peak times @xmath7 ( 150 and 180 s for grb060418 and grb060607a , respectively ) are longer than the burst durations , and this corresponds to the so - called thin - shell case . in this scenario ,",
    "the afterglow peak time roughly marks the epoch at which the expanding fireball has swept up enough mass to be significantly decelerated . using the formulation by @xcite , we have @xmath8^{1/8},\\ ] ] where @xmath9  erg is the fireball ( isotropic - equivalent ) energy , @xmath10  @xmath11 is the particle density of the surrounding medium ( supposed homogeneous ) , @xmath12 is the radiative efficiency , and @xmath13 .",
    "we infer @xmath0 for both bursts , weakly dependent on the unknown efficiency and external medium density .    in our computation",
    ", we have assumed a homogeneous medium .",
    "the light curve before the peak indeed rises as @xmath14 , consistent with the expectations for a uniform ism @xcite and in contrast with a wind - shaped ( @xmath15 ) environment .",
    "after the peak , however , the behaviour of grb060418 is inconsistent with both a homogeneous and a wind medium .",
    "this might be due , for example , to varying microphysical parameters , or presence of compton emission , or radiative losses .",
    "assuming a wind - shaped density profile , we find a somehow lower value for the lorentz factor , @xmath16 .",
    "the measured values are in agreement with theoretical predictions and consistent with existing lower limits @xcite . using @xmath17 , we compute the emission radius @xmath18 ^ 2/(1+z ) \\approx 10^{17}$ ]  cm .",
    "this is much larger than the internal shocks scale ( where the prompt emission is believed to arise ) , confirming the different origin of these two components .",
    "albeit @xmath19 is similar for grb060418 and grb060607a , a universal value is unlikely .",
    "for example , no peak was observed for grb050401 @xcite , implying @xmath20 .",
    "the detection of the peak allows the measurement of another important quantity , the afterglow bolometric fluence @xmath21 .",
    "the integration over the frequency domain requires also the knowledge of the spectral shape . for grb060418 , our multiwavelength coverage , coupled with the x - ray monitoring , allows to determine the peak frequency as a function of time , and the spectrum can be safely extrapolated .",
    "the host - galaxy extinction ( @xmath22  mag ) was computed by imposing for the optical / nir and x - ray spectral slopes @xmath23 , and assuming an smc extinction curve .    by computing the integral , we get @xmath24  erg  @xmath25 . to our knowledge , this is the first case for which such a measurement has been performed . for comparison ,",
    "the prompt emission bolometric fluence ( easily computed thanks to the broad - band _ wind_/konus measurement ; @xcite ) is @xmath26  erg  @xmath25 .",
    "this implies an afterglow - to - prompt fluence ratio of 16% . in principle ,",
    "external shocks are more efficient in dissipating the fireball energy than internal collisions ( which have a low lorentz factor contrast ) .",
    "our result thus implies that external shocks are not much efficient in radiating the dissipated energy .",
    "this is consistent with the observed regime of slow cooling inferred by the sed modeling .",
