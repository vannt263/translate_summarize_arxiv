    "the question of the pairing state of high temperature superconductors ( htsc s ) continues to baffle researchers in the field .",
    "a recent review @xcite of many of the experimental results closes after over eighty pages with the tentative conclusion that the only state compatible with all experiments would have to exhibit two separate transitions , in contrast with the single transition invariably observed in htsc s .",
    "worse , even different experiments performed on the very same single crystal sample seem to lead to contradictory conclusions.@xcite this situation makes it particularly desirable to find good probes that may as unambiguously as possible discern the structure of the order parameter ( op ) function .",
    "one such probe is afforded by the nonlinear maxwell - london electrodynamics of exotic pairing states in superconductors in the meissner state .",
    "it was pointed out four years ago@xcite in the context of a two - dimensional model ( htsc s are nearly all highly anisotropic , layered materials ) that the presence of order parameter lines of nodes on a cylindrical fermi surface would lead to observable nonlinear effects in the electrodynamic properties . these effects were shown to be@xcite potentially capable of yielding a signature for the structure of the order parameter function , and therefore for the nodal structure of the gap itself .",
    "the most obvious of them is the presence of a transverse magnetic moment @xmath0 perpendicular to the direction of an applied magnetic field @xmath1 lying in the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) plane ( the @xmath4 axis is taken to be along the @xmath5 crystallographic direction , perpendicular to the stack of planes in the lattice structure ) .",
    "this transverse magnetic moment has an angular dependence , as the sample is rotated about the @xmath4 axis , reflecting directly the periodicity of the energy spectrum , that is , of the square of the order parameter , on the azimuthal angle @xmath6",
    ". this signal would be particularly prominent if the order parameter has nodes or very deep minima as a function of angle .",
    "the transverse moment can be measured directly or inferred from the torque it produces .",
    "electrodynamic effects are of particular interest because they probe the superconducting properties over a scale given by the field penetration depth , while many other experimental methods , such as tunneling and josephson junctions , probe only over the scale of the correlation length , which in htsc s is over two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "thus , electrodynamics probes the bulk properties of the superconducting material , not merely the surface",
    ". some of the apparent conflicts among experimental results may be resolved@xcite if the order parameter symmetries in the bulk and at the surface differ .    for these reasons",
    ", investigations of the transverse magnetic moment effect have continued . for the model of a `` slab '' shaped sample , infinite in the @xmath2 directions and of fixed thickness , and a cylindrical fermi surface ,",
    "the equations involved in the nonlinear maxwell - london electrodynamics have been solved numerically@xcite for the experimentally relevant ranges of applied magnetic field and temperature . at @xmath7 , for the same geometry and assumptions , a perturbative , but accurate , analytic solution has been obtained@xcite . in ref .",
    "results were obtained for both a pure d - wave state and a mixture of @xmath8 and @xmath9 waves .",
    "the amplitude of the transverse magnetization at low temperatures was found to increase@xcite as approximately the second power of the applied field , and , since one is dealing with an effect arising from a finite penetration depth , as the surface area of the sample .",
    "the results@xcite indicated that , for a pure d - wave state , @xmath10 should be detectable by a squid magnetometer in single crystal samples , even though the applied field is limited , by the need to keep the sample in the meissner regime , to the field of first flux penetration .",
    "the results of only one experiment seeking to find the transverse magnetization@xcite effect have been published@xcite .",
    "no evidence of a transverse magnetic moment having the proper periodicity was obtained , but the nature of the data and of its analysis was such that the absence of evidence could not be conclusively taken to be evidence of absence .",
    "the resolution of the measurements was , over most of the field range studied , comparable to the signal measured . at the higher fields used the signal was below , but only by a factor of two , the theoretically expected results for a pure d - wave state , based on the infinite slab assumptions@xcite discussed in the above paragraph , scaled to the finite size of the sample .",
    "although a subsequent analysis@xcite of the field dependence of the experimental signal @xcite was also supportive of the inference that no nodes were observed , a completely definitive statement about the existence of nodes could not be made because of theoretical and experimental uncertainties .    although this paper deals with the theoretical questions it is useful to briefly mention here the main difficulty associated with the experiments : except in the ideal world of theorists where all samples , even when finite , are spheres or other highly symmetric bodies , there _ always is _ in any superconductor , a transverse magnetic moment because of demagnetization effects@xcite . for the rectangular samples used in the experiment@xcite these effects are much larger than the nonlinear contribution",
    "of course , their main periodicity , @xmath11 , is twice that associated ( @xmath12 ) with the d - wave nonlinear effects .",
    "fourier analysis of the data , as done in ref .",
    "does filter out the main spurious demagnetization signal , but its @xmath12 harmonic still will be confounded with the nonlinear signal and , although it can partly be sorted out@xcite because of its different , linear , magnetic field dependence , the noise introduced in the original signal by the fourier transforms and subtractions takes a heavy toll .",
    "the work in this paper is motivated in large part by experiments now being planned@xcite on samples having approximately a flat disk shape that minimizes the demagnetization effect for an applied field lying in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "it seems to us that reaching conclusions from experimental data taken on samples lacking rotational symmetry would be difficult .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are related to the use in the work discussed above of two approximations : first , the use of an infinite slab geometry neglects the contribution to @xmath13 of return currents flowing along the sides of the sample , parallel to the z - axis .",
    "furthermore , the penetration depth for those currents , @xmath14 is much larger than that in the a - b plane , @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath0 increases with penetration depth , the question of how the larger @xmath14 must be included in the analysis arises .",
    "the effect of @xmath14 was included in the analysis of the data@xcite but in a purely heuristic way , which assumed that its influence was rather strong .",
    "although this assumption was relaxed in a subsequent reanalysis@xcite , the whole question remains a major obstacle in reaching conclusions from experimental evidence .",
    "a finite @xmath14 implies also abandoning the notion of a cylindrical fermi surface .",
    "further , the very neglect of finite size effects is suspect : they have been shown@xcite to affect the analysis of penetration depth experiments in rather large samples .",
    "the uncertainties related to these complications in analyzing experimental data in the context of the geometric approximations of ref .",
    "are about as large as the experimental uncertainties and it might be argued that , in combination , are about as large as the discrepancy between theory and experiment .    in this paper",
    "we therefore undertake the examination of maxwell - london electrodynamics , including nonlinear contributions , for finite samples .",
    "we include in the study the effects of @xmath14 , which affect the electromagnetic response even at linear order in the field , and we specifically consider geometries relevant to the experimental systems currently been studied . because of these realistic assumptions , not only is an analytic solution unattainable even at zero temperature , but the numerical work involved is quite considerable .",
    "our results confirm that a transverse magnetic moment should be observable in obtainable single crystal samples , if the bulk pairing is in a d - wave state .",
    "the effect discussed in this paper is a fingerprint for the existence of an op with d - wave symmetry .",
    "its experimental observation in suitable samples , would constitute very hard to refute evidence for d - wave pairing in the bulk . failure to observe this effect would at the very least put a lower bound on the existence of an s - wave component .    in the next section we present the equations solved and",
    "we discuss the methods we use . in section iii ,",
    "we present our results and predictions for experimental outcomes , assuming a d - wave order parameter is present .",
    "our conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "the equations of superconducting electrodynamics are in textbooks @xcite and need no rederivation .",
    "we will merely introduce here our notation , and briefly recall a couple of easy to overlook points .",
    "for the linear case , a particularly clear discussion of the complications that occur when the penetration depth tensor is anisotropic is in chapter 3 of ref .",
    ".    outside the sample the current is @xmath16 and therefore in the steady state the field @xmath1 satisfies the maxwell equations @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "one can therefore write @xmath1 in terms of a scalar potential @xmath19 satisfying the laplace equation :    [ out ] @xmath20 @xmath21    in the interior of the sample one must consider three fields : @xmath1 , @xmath22 and the `` superfluid velocity field '' @xmath23 defined as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the phase of the superconducting order parameter , @xmath26 the vector potential , and @xmath27 the proton charge .",
    "we set @xmath28 .",
    "eq.([vdef ] ) is equivalent to eq .",
    "( 5.99 ) in ref .. the field @xmath23 has dimensions of momentum , not velocity , but the factors associated with the effective mass and its anisotropies are more conveniently dealt with by placing them elsewhere .",
    "the three equations that one requires for these three fields are first , the second london equation obtained by taking the curl of ( [ vdef ] ) : @xmath29 second , ampre s law : @xmath30 and finally , a constitutive equation relating @xmath22 and @xmath23 which is discussed in general in the next subsection . for the usual linear case",
    "this relation is of course simply : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the superfluid density tensor .",
    "the nonlinear contribution is discussed below ( see eq .",
    "( [ jtzero ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath32 is related to the penetration depth tensor @xmath33 , whose components in the diagonal representation are the square of the london penetration depths , by the relation : @xmath34 when these tensors are proportional to the identity , then one can combine eqns.([londoneq ] ) and ( [ ampere ] ) and find that any one of the three fields considered satisfies the vector helmholtz equation .",
    "but this is not true@xcite when @xmath32 is anisotropic .",
    "one still has , however , the completely general equation : @xmath35 which is valid whatever the relation @xmath36 might be .",
    "( [ maxlon ] ) will be the basic equation we will consider here .",
    "these equations must be solved with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "these are : first , at infinity ( that is , very far away from the finite sample ) @xmath1 must reduce to the applied field .",
    "second , deep inside the sample all fields must vanish .",
    "finally , at the interface @xmath1 must be continuous@xcite and the component of @xmath22 normal to the interface must vanish .",
    "once the currents @xmath22 inside the sample are known , the magnetic moment can be obtained by integration:@xcite @xmath37    it is convenient to rewrite this equation in terms of surface integrals . using eq .",
    "( [ ampere ] ) and formulas for vector calculus @xcite we derive : @xmath38 integration is performed over the sample surface s , * r * is the position vector for a point on the surface s , and * n * is the unit normal pointing outwards .    in the linear regime , and for the case which is experimentally relevant here where one has a small but finite value of the ratio @xmath39 between a typical penetration depth @xmath40 and a characteristic sample dimension @xmath9 , the components of @xmath41 can generically be written in the form @xmath42 .",
    "examples for values of the positive constant @xmath43 are given in textbooks@xcite .",
    "one has , then , a reduction in the magnetic moment due to current penetration in the material .",
    "the nonlinear effects may be conveniently viewed for our purposes as anisotropic , field - dependent corrections to the values of the @xmath43 coefficients .      to obtain the supercurrent response one has to specify the full constitutive relation @xmath36 as discussed above .",
    "the linear contribution has been given in eqns .",
    "( [ linear ] ) and ( [ rholam ] ) .",
    "the anisotropy in @xmath33 is related to that of the fermi surface and can be related to the effective mass tensor@xcite .",
    "the anisotropy of the order parameter considered in this work would not , if the fermi surface were isotropic , lead to any anisotropies in the penetration depth@xcite , at linear order in the magnetic field .",
    "thus we have : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the effective mass tensor and @xmath46 the carrier density .",
    "the nonlinear corrections to @xmath36 were first discussed by bardeen@xcite in the context of an s - wave superconductor . in that case , at @xmath7 , the current - velocity relation is linear for velocities less than a critical velocity @xmath47 defined below .",
    "nonlinear corrections to the current - velocity relation arise from the thermal population of quasiparticles .",
    "these corrections are small@xcite ( cubic in the ratio @xmath48 ) and in the regime of larger flow velocities vortex nucleation may occur before these effects become important@xcite . on the other hand , in unconventional superconductors , particularly those with nodes in the op , nonlinear corrections are significantly larger and qualitatively different than in a superconductor with an s - wave excitation gap .",
    "the region on the fermi surface ( fs ) close to the nodes in the gap provides enhanced nonlinear response due to the higher population of quasiparticles .",
    "there the energy required to break electron pairs will be reduced and will vanish along the direction of the lines of nodes in the gap .",
    "thus nonlinear corrections in the presence of nodes in the op are nonvanishing even at @xmath7 and the nonlinear behavior exhibits anisotropy with respect to the relative angle between applied magnetic field and the lines of nodes of the gap function .    for the purpose of computing @xmath10 for a crystallographycally strongly anisotropic htsc , in the geometry considered here , we are concerned with the angular dependence of the op in the plane of the applied field , the @xmath3 plane . in most of the numerical calculations performed in this work ,",
    "we consider an order parameter of the pure d - wave form : @xmath49 where @xmath6 is the azimuthal angle referred to a node and @xmath50 the amplitude .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath10 , which equals that of the energy , is therefore @xmath12 . it would be possible , as we shall see , to generalize the calculations to other @xmath6 dependence for the op if necessary .",
    "possible dependence of @xmath51 on the @xmath5 direction is very uncertain because of multilayering effects@xcite , but we believe it is unlikely to be important .",
    "this follows from the above physical considerations , and from the brief discussion of results for alternative forms in the next section and appendix a. on the other hand , we must properly take into account the strong anisotropy of @xmath33 in the @xmath5 direction , which is related to that of the fermi surface .",
    "the assumption of isotropy in the @xmath3 plane deserves further discussion , since anisotropies in the in - plane penetration depth in htsc s are known to exist.@xcite anisotropy in @xmath15 will lead to a contribution to @xmath10 of periodicity @xmath11 ( instead of @xmath12 for the nonlinear signal ) , and ( see the paragraph below ( [ eq : magmoms ] ) ) down by a factor of @xmath52 ( the ratio of a typical penetration depth to a typical sample dimension ) from the longitudinal , linear magnetic moment .",
    "this contribution will be linear , not quadratic , in the field .",
    "hence , from an experimental point of view , it is in effect a small correction to the effective demagnetization factor which is , although to a small extent , present even in macroscopically symmetric samples .",
    "thus , fourier analysis of the experimental signal and examination of the field dependence of the harmonics would separate this from the nonlinear effect . as for the theoretical results discussed here",
    "it is sufficient to interpret our symbol @xmath15 for the @xmath3 plane penetration depth ( @xmath14 is that along the c - direction ) as the geometric mean of @xmath53 and @xmath54 . finally , if",
    "because of orthorhombic anisotropy the nodes are not precisely at @xmath12 angles , this can be accounted for by adding a small constant@xcite to ( [ op ] ) and therefore the @xmath12 fourier component of the response would be little affected .    for an order parameter with nodes , it is known@xcite that the details of the fs shape are not important for the nonlinear properties we deal with here : only the nodes and their symmetry matter .",
    "thus , our chief concern about the fs is to describe the anisotropy in @xmath33 . for this purpose ,",
    "we have used in our calculations an ellipsoidal ( of revolution ) fermi surface characterized by effective masses @xmath55 ( in the @xmath3 plane ) and @xmath56 , as in eq .",
    "( [ ef ] ) .",
    "we introduce the ratio @xmath57 .",
    "we define a speed @xmath58 in terms of the fermi energy @xmath59 as @xmath60 which facilitates comparison with two - dimensional results .",
    "the general expression @xcite for @xmath36 , including nonlinear terms , can be written as : @xmath61 \\label{jtzero}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the total density of states at the fermi level , @xmath63 is the density of states at point @xmath8 at the fermi surface , normalized to unity , @xmath64 is the @xmath8-dependent fermi velocity , @xmath65 the fermi function , and @xmath66 . in general , the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ jtzero ] ) can be evaluated only numerically , as was done in 2-d in ref .. however it was shown there that at the temperatures ( about two kelvin ) where the experiments are performed , one is very near the zero temperature limit .",
    "therefore we confine ourselves in this work to this limit , where , within the assumptions discussed above , it is possible to derive an analytic expression for @xmath36 , valid in the limit where @xmath67 is large .",
    "having an analytic expression for @xmath36 makes the subsequent substantial numerical work easier . in a magnetic field",
    "( hence @xmath68 ) even at @xmath7 there exists a region with @xmath69 where it is possible to have a quasiparticle population .",
    "one can then perform , as in ref .",
    "an approximate but accurate integration of the general formula eq .",
    "( [ jtzero ] ) , to obtain the nonlinear corrections at zero temperature ( details are given in appendix a ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath36 relation is valid under the assumptions for the fs and the op discussed above , and for any three dimensional strongly anisotropic superconductor ( independent of sample geometry ) .",
    "introducing cartesian axes x-y fixed to the crystal along the nodal directions the expression we obtain is :    [ jnl ] @xmath70 @xmath71    where @xmath72 . the components of the superfluid density tensor are @xmath73 , @xmath74 @xmath75 , in the @xmath3 plane and along the @xmath5 crystallographic axis respectively . even for ybco",
    "reported@xcite measured values for @xmath76 are quite large , between 15 and 50 .",
    "omitted terms in the above relation are those involving higher powers of @xmath77 1 ( for the regime of experimental interest in the meissner state ) or supressed by the small parameter @xmath78 .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the sample geometry considered in the calculation of the supercurrent response in the meissner state .",
    "the dependence of measured quantities such as the local magnetic field , actual current distribution and magnetic moment on sample shape is one of the issues of particular interest in this work , as explained in the introduction .",
    "the experimentally relevant regime is that of small but finite ratio of penetration depths to typical sample dimension . as mentioned below eqn.([eq : magmoms ] ) , the geometric dependence of the effect under investigation in this regime@xcite is proportional to these ratios .",
    "thus , the coefficient of this finite size term must be accurately calculated . a `` locally flat '' approximation ( assuming a purely exponential decay for the fields away from the surface ) is not sufficient for this purpose , as one can check even in the linear case from the exact solution for a sphere@xcite .",
    "it is therefore necessary to solve the complete boundary value problem , that is , to find the solution to the equations ( [ out ] ) and ( [ maxlon ] ) outside and inside of the sample .",
    "this is in principle a numerically difficult undertaking , since _ a priori _ it involves solving a system of partial differential equations with nonlinear terms in the entire three dimensional space , but with currents being confined to a very small region where great precision is required .",
    "although sophisticated variable grid methods could perhaps be found to take care of these complications , the relatively symmetric shape of the required experimental samples allows for a simpler approach .",
    "single crystals of htsc materials are typically flat , much thinner in the c - direction than in the @xmath3 plane . the magnetic field , we recall , is applied parallel to this plane along the @xmath79 direction .",
    "the geometry and coordinate system we consider are sketched in fig . [ fig1 ] .",
    "because of the complications associated with demagnetization factors , as described in the introduction , experiments must be performed on single crystals of a highly symmetric shape .",
    "this is achieved by laser cutting , or shaving@xcite the crystals so that their cross section in the direction perpendicular to the @xmath4 axis is circular .",
    "their shape is , therefore , roughly a disk , thinning towards the edges because of mechanical disintegration associated with the cutting .",
    "they have smooth edges and can therefore be described as ellipsoids of revolution .",
    "this geometry has also a considerable computational advantage : the form of the solution outside the sample in the limit @xmath80 is known exactly since the potential @xmath19 ( see ( [ out ] ) ) satisfies trivial neumann boundary conditions at the interface and can be found by electrostatic analogy .",
    "the solution contains a single parameter which is simply related to @xmath81 , the value of the longitudinal magnetic moment in the zero penetration limit .",
    "when the penetration depth is finite , the longitudinal moment does change , but its correct value can be determined from the boundary conditions and the solution inside through an iteration process as described in the next section .",
    "but , as important as these simplifications are , they only go so far : the fundamental equation ( [ maxlon ] ) is not separable in spheroidal coordinates .",
    "we therefore consider a supercondutor in the shape of a flat ellipsoid of revolution ( an oblate spheroid ) with the axis of revolution along the z - axis .",
    "its major and minor semiaxes are denoted by @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively , and we have @xmath84 for actual samples . we take ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) a coordinate system fixed to the direction of the magnetic field , with its z - axis parallel to the @xmath5 crystalographic direction of the superconductor ( and parallel to the @xmath83 semiaxis of an ellipsoid ) .",
    "the field is applied along the x - axis , and we picture the experiment as being performed by rotating the crystal about the z - axis . as the crystal is rotated the axes @xmath2",
    "remain fixed in space , and should not be confused with the previously introduced @xmath85 coordinates , affixed to the crystal structure .    even with the nonseparability of the equations , it is still convenient from the point of view of fulfilling the interface boundary conditions , to introduce oblate spheroidal coordinates @xmath86 . in the definition we use@xcite , they are related to cartesian coordinates by the transformation :    [ eq : coor ] @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89    where @xmath90 , and @xmath65 is a focal length scale factor .",
    "the surface of an ellipsoid corresponds to a given value of @xmath43 .    for an ellipsoid of revolution ( about its @xmath4 axis ) in the presence of uniform magnetic field @xmath91 applied along the direction that we denote as the @xmath79 axis the magnetic potential in the outside region for @xmath92 has the form @xcite @xmath93 , where the first term is the potential for the uniform applied field @xmath94 and the gradient of the second term is the field generated by the superconducting ellipsoid .",
    "writing out in detail the function @xmath95 one has : @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are associated legendre functions of the first and second kind respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath99 is determined from the boundary conditions .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath100 , the longitudinal magnetic moment : @xmath101 its value at @xmath92 is : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the value at the surface of the ellipsoid .",
    "eqns.([a1 ] ) and ( [ longmag ] ) can be combined to yield the usual expression for @xmath81 , the zero penetration depth , purely longitudinal , magnetic moment , in terms of the ellipsoidal demagnetization factors.@xcite at finite @xmath33 the value for @xmath99 is obtained from the iterative procedure discussed in the next subsection . in the spherical limit @xmath104",
    "we also recover the standard result@xcite .",
    "let us discuss now the iterative procedure we use to solve ( [ maxlon ] ) , while avoiding to have to numerically solve the field equations in all space",
    ". for clarity , let us focus first on the case where the nonlinear effects are neglected but the penetration depths are finite .",
    "this has two effects on the solution outside : first , the value of @xmath99 ( or of @xmath100 ) deviates from the value given by ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "secondly , the field acquires higher order multipoles , i.e. the field potential acquires additional terms : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the potential corresponding to the applied field ( the first term on the right side of ( [ eq : phiout ] ) ) and the gradient of the rest is the field created outside the sample by the current distribution in it .",
    "the terms with @xmath107 vanish at @xmath80 ( and also in the spherical case if @xmath33 is isotropic . )",
    "the fields generated by @xmath99 are not purely dipolar , since they have ellipsoidal symmetry .",
    "however , the dipole moment is determined by this parameter only . at the first step of the iteration",
    "we solve the linear version of ( [ maxlon ] ) for the current field , assuming that the outside field is given by its @xmath92 limit , i.e. the gradient of ( [ eq : phiout ] ) with ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "parameter counting shows that in order to do so we must give up one boundary condition , and accordingly we temporarily sacrifice the continuity of the `` radial '' field ( @xmath108 component ) . from the resulting current distribution we compute @xmath41 through ( [ eq : magmoms ] ) .",
    "this is of course not the same as the input moment .",
    "we then replace this obtained value in the external potential ( through ( [ longmag ] ) ) and repeat the procedure@xcite until the moment generated by the computed currents equals the input value .",
    "the iteration is considerably simplified by observing that several terms in ( [ eq : magmoms ] ) vanish explicitly when @xmath80 and by making use of the fact that the penetration depths are small@xcite compared to the sample dimensions .",
    "once the iteration is concluded , one finds that @xmath109 is continuous except in a very narrow band near the equator corresponding to a symmetry higher than dipolar .",
    "this can then be eliminated by adding small values for higher order @xmath110 s to the expansion ( [ figen ] ) , but symmetry considerations and examination of eq .",
    "( [ eq : magmoms ] ) show that these additions do not affect the already determined value of the sample magnetic moment .",
    "it is easy and very instructive to verify analytically that this procedure recovers the known result@xcite for the @xmath40 dependent magnetic moment of a sphere with an isotropic @xmath33 .",
    "the same procedure is used with the nonlinear terms , with only two important differences : first , to the field outside one must add a transverse dipole , i.e. a contribution of the form of the last term in ( [ eq : phiout ] ) rotated @xmath111 : @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "of course this term does not exist when the penetration depths vanish , since the nonlinear effects are absent unless the field can penetrate the sample . in principle one",
    "should also consider higher order multipole terms , as in ( [ figen ] ) but we have found that any such terms are below the precision level of our numerical results . both components of the moment @xmath41 are determined through the vector relation ( [ eq : magmoms ] ) .",
    "the other important difference is the obvious one of using ( [ jnl ] ) for the @xmath36 relation .",
    "there are also practical differences , however , since in the linear equations the variable @xmath114 can be separated out while in the full nonlinear case all three coordinates are coupled .    in the actual solution of the equations we use a relaxation method .",
    "we proceed in two steps : first we solve the linear problem , which involves only two variables , since then the @xmath114 dependence of all quantities can be determined analytically .",
    "the iterated solution for that problem is then used as the initial guess in the full three - variable nonlinear problem .",
    "we discretize the differential equations expressed in ellipsoidal ( oblate spheroidal ) coordinates , on a three dimenssional grid .",
    "an obvious advantage of the ellipsoidal grid is that it simplifies consideration of boundary conditions at the surface of the ellipsoid , given by equation ( [ londoneq ] ) .",
    "numerically , it is more intricate to consider boundary conditions that involve derivatives , and accuracy is increased if the grid points are also boundary points .",
    "the discretization procedure we have used has an estimated error quadratic in the spacing between the grid points .",
    "all quantities involved in equations ( [ maxlon ] ) have definite parity with respect to the exchange @xmath4 @xmath115@xmath116 and it is sufficient to solve them only for one half of the sample .",
    "accuracy is predominantly governed by the spacing between grid points along the @xmath108 direction . in the actual numerical solution ( for half the sample ) , we consider ellipsoids of different shapes ( different @xmath117 ) and sizes ( different @xmath82 ) .",
    "it is appropriate to increase @xmath118 proportionally to @xmath117 . denoting by @xmath119 the number of grid points along the @xmath108 direction , the smallest @xmath119 used was 100 , and the largest 800 , spaced in the region of nonvanishing currents .",
    "the number of grid points along the @xmath120 and @xmath121 directions was @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "increasing these numbers by a factor of two gave only effects below the numerical accuracy attained , which is about two significant figures , an error much smaller that the uncertainty arising from the imprecise knowledge of the experimental values of the input parameters .",
    "as one of the checks on the accuracy of the algorithm we use , it is instructive to consider the case of an isotropic spherical sample , ( both the sample and the fermi surface are spheres , @xmath124 ) in the linear regime , where the analytical solution is known . to ensure that we tested the same algorithm , we treated the sphere as the the spherical limit of ellipsoidal coordinates , which corresponds to @xmath125 @xmath126 .",
    "we used @xmath125 = 1000 , equivalent to eccentricity @xmath127=0.001 with the grid given by @xmath128 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 grid points .",
    "we solved equations ( [ maxlon ] ) in a spherical shell of thickness 10@xmath40 and studied both the magnetic moment and the current distributions .",
    "the accuracy for the current on any grid point corresponded to four significant figures for the region where currents are important .",
    "the magnetic moment calculated both from ( [ magmom ] ) and from the surface integrals ( [ eq : magmoms ] ) agrees with the exact result , including the correct finite penetration depth correction .",
    "we have also checked that our results for the longitudinal magnetic moment extrapolated to the zero penetration depth limit agree with the known analytic result for ellipsoids .",
    "we have also verified that the magnetic moment calculated from ( [ magmom ] ) agrees from that found from the surface integrals ( [ eq : magmoms ] ) .",
    "the latter procedure is , however , much more convenient .      in performing the calculations and describing the results ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce dimensionless quantities . because of the shape of the samples , we use @xmath15 as the unit of length .",
    "we then define the dimensionless fields : @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 : @xmath132 where we have introduced a characteristic magnetic field @xmath133 as : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the flux quantum and @xmath136 is the in - plane superconducting coherence length .",
    "the definition of ( [ h0 ] ) involves precisely the same numerical factors as that used in ref .. the required equations are easily rewritten in terms of these quantities .",
    "the boundary conditions for the velocity field in ( [ maxlon ] ) are now : @xmath137 where the right hand side is the external dimensionless field at the surface of the ellipsoid and from now on the derivatives are with respect to dimensionless length .",
    "the remaining boundary condition that there is no normal component of current at the surface is readily obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ jnl ] ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 in equations ( [ jnl ] ) then becomes :    [ maxlon2 ] @xmath138 @xmath139    where we recall @xmath140 . equations ( [ maxlon2 ] ) are transformed to ellipsoidal coordinates , as defined above .",
    "expressions for the superfluid density tensor and the differential operator @xmath141 , in ellipsoidal coordinates are included in appendix b.    in figures [ linearcur ] and [ nonlincur ] we show some of the results for the currents .",
    "these figures illustrate some of the physics , as well as the quality of the numerics .",
    "in fig [ linearcur ] we show the current @xmath142 going along the @xmath4 direction in the @xmath2 plane as a function of distance from the surface of the sample starting at the point with cartesian coordinates @xmath143 .",
    "this current is overwhelmingly determined by the usual linear response to the field .",
    "one can clearly see that its decay as a function of depth from the surface is governed by the @xmath14 penetration depth , and not by @xmath15 .",
    "the next figure illustrates the difference between the linear and nonlinear components of the current .",
    "it shows the current , again as a function of depth , starting at the center of the top of the sample , i.e. a point with cartesian coordinates @xmath144 .",
    "the component @xmath145 , normal to the applied field , is very predominantly `` linear '' and one can see that this time the decay is governed by the in - plane penetration depth , as expected from the geometry .",
    "the component @xmath146 along the applied field , on the other hand , arises exclusively from nonlinear effects : symmetry considerations show that it vanishes in the linear limit .",
    "its overall scale is down by a large factor ( basically the ratio of longitudinal and transverse moments ) .",
    "one sees that even though the overall decay of @xmath146 is determined by the scale @xmath15 , its behavior is very far from exponential : it changes sign as a function of depth .",
    "this can be readily understood : at the positions plotted , close to the center of the the top of the ellipsoid , @xmath146 is approximately proportional ( from ampre s law ) to the derivative with respect to @xmath4 of the anomalous component of the field , @xmath147 .",
    "this field component nearly vanishes at the surface ( it would vanish for a slab ) and decreases exponentially at depths larger than @xmath15 . hence , at this position in the sample , @xmath147 has an extremum as a function of depth , and its derivative with respect to @xmath4 _ must _ change sign at some point , as we find .",
    "this shows the delicate intricacy of the nonlinear current patterns inside the material .    before proceeding with the detailed discussion of the dependence of our results on the relevant physical quantitites ( i.e. size , shape , applied field , and penetration depths )",
    "we illustrate their general scope by describing our prediction for the transverse magnetic moment of a possible htsc superconducting sample , assumed to be in a pure d - wave pairing state .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ predict ] .",
    "we show there results for @xmath148 as a function of applied field .",
    "the quantity shown is the maximum value of @xmath148 as the crystal is rotated .",
    "it is assumed that the sample is an ellipsoid with @xmath149 mm and @xmath150 mm .",
    "material parameters are taken to be @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 . the characteristic field @xmath133 would be about 5800 gauss .",
    "one can see that the magnetic moments involved are readily accessible to measurement .",
    "predictions for samples of other sizes , shapes and material parameters can be conveniently extracted from the information given below .",
    "we have obtained results for the transverse magnetic moment for a wide range of the experimentally accessible values of the appropriate dimensionless parameters , which as we shall see , can be taken to be @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid of revolution .",
    "we did not consider in our study the `` thin film '' situation where the sample is so small or so thin that its relevant dimensions are comparable to or smaller than the corresponding penetration depth .",
    "this case would be of no interest since the nonlinear effects then are vanishingly small@xcite , and it is excluded from the analysis that follows .",
    "we begin our general discussion of the results by performing some dimensional analysis .",
    "the quantity @xmath158 has dimensions of magnetic field times volume .",
    "the expression @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the sample volume , is therefore dimensionless . even though @xmath161 is suitable for some purposes",
    ", it is more convenient to analyze the dependence of the results on sample size in a different way .",
    "the reason is that @xmath162 does not scale with the sample volume but@xcite as its surface area .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality between transverse moment and area depends on the sample _ shape _ and one can express this dependence through the aspect ratio@xcite @xmath163 . since the area of an ellipsoid of revolution is @xmath164 times a function of @xmath163 , it is easier for the purpose of giving results in a form more accessible to experimentalists , to scale explicitly results for ellipsoids of the same aspect ratio ( i.e. the same shape ) by a factor of the `` disk '' area @xmath165 .",
    "the third length that goes into the volume factor in the units of @xmath166 is@xcite a penetration depth .",
    "since we are dealing with rather large @xmath167 ratios , with currents predominantly in the @xmath3 plane , it is advantageous for our purposes to take this length into accout by writing out a factor of @xmath15 explicitly .",
    "thus we put , as a first step : @xmath168 here and hereafter we denote the magnitude of the applied field simply by @xmath169 , rather than @xmath170 , as there is no longer a possibility of confusion .",
    "it is not surprising in view of the above dimensional analysis that we find @xmath171 to be a rather weak function of its first two arguments and independent@xcite of @xmath172 and of @xmath173 .",
    "the angular dependence of @xmath174 is given by the function @xmath175 ) in terms of the angle @xmath176 between the applied field and a node .",
    "we normalize @xmath177 so that its value is unity at its maximum .",
    "our results for the angular dependence are shown in figure [ shape ] .",
    "the points shown are the values obtained from our numerical calculation .",
    "the error bars indicate the numerical uncertainty .",
    "the solid line represents the analytic result for the two dimensional calculations in the slab case@xcite , normalized in the same way .",
    "we see from the figure that the shape of @xmath177 is , within numerical uncertainty , the same as for the flat case , where , with the same normalization , @xmath178 , ( for @xmath179 ) .",
    "this is important , because@xcite the @xmath12 fourier coefficient of @xmath177 , as analytically calculated from the above expression , is unity to three significant figures .",
    "we can therefore identify here the coefficient of @xmath177 in ( [ mfirst ] ) with the fourier amplitude @xmath174 as introduced earlier in the paper .",
    "the results shown in this figure were obtained at @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 , but similar results are obtained in all other cases studied .    as can already be seen in figure [ predict ] , the coefficient @xmath171 depends strongly on its third argument , the applied field .",
    "we have studied the field range @xmath183 at @xmath184 intervals .",
    "we expect that the nonlinear @xmath174 is proportional to @xmath185 , as in the slab case at zero temperature .",
    "we therefore conclude that a very convenient way of writing our results for the amplitude is : @xmath186 equation ( [ mtr2 ] ) implies explicitly that @xmath187 is a function of field only through the ratio @xmath188 .",
    "we have verified that , as expected , @xmath189 is independent of the field .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ hsquare ] , where we plot the quantity @xmath190 vs @xmath169 .",
    "we see that our results , represented by the symbols with error bars , are on a straight line , which is indicated by a best fit . except for the field ,",
    "the parameter values are the same as in the previous figure . as in the case of the angular dependence",
    ", this qualitative result holds in all cases studied .",
    "the slope of the best fit straight line in plots such as that in this figure is used to extract @xmath189 .",
    "the geometric aspect ratios we have considered in the nonlinear case range from @xmath1917 up to 19 ( that is from @xmath1920.14433 to 0.05270 ) .",
    "comparison of the results with largest eccentricity to previous work on the slab case illustrates the effect of the return currents .",
    "this comparison can not be made by taking @xmath193 because we must have @xmath194 .",
    "the central portion of a flat ellipsoid can be identified as a `` slab '' .",
    "it is simpler to make the comparison in terms of @xmath161 defined in ( [ qeq ] ) .",
    "it follows from our dimensional analysis that : @xmath195 the corresponding result for the slab is of the same form , and the coefficient may be extracted from the @xmath7 results of ref .. when all the relevant factors , such as the different definition of @xmath133 , the normalization of @xmath177 , and the setting of the parameter@xcite @xmath196 ( slope of the op near a node ) to @xmath197 are taken into account , one finds that the slab value is @xmath198 .",
    "we obtain @xmath199 for our flattest ellipsoid at @xmath181 , a number only weakly dependent on @xmath67 .",
    "hence , the presence of return currents enhances the nonlinear effects but , as hinted by the recent reanalysis@xcite of the experimental data , the enhancement is about three times smaller , in typical situations , than the @xmath67 dependent factor postulated in ref . .",
    "we next show the dependence of our results on the remaining parameters , @xmath167 and @xmath155 . as explained above",
    ", our results are most useful to experimentalists if given in terms of the scaled dimensionless amplitude @xmath189 .",
    "we therefore summarize the dependence of this quantity on the mentioned length ratios in table i. this table can be used , in conjuction with eq .",
    "( [ mtr2 ] ) to compute the theoretical predictions , when planning experiments or comparing data and theory .",
    "the rows are the relevant material parameter , given as the square of the penetration depth ratio , and the columns are the crystal shape . for crystals that are not quite ellipsoidal",
    ", one should choose a @xmath117 ratio in the table so that the surface to volume ratio of the ellipsoid agrees with that of the crystal .",
    "as the results vary slowly across the rows and columns of the table , interpolation and reasonable extrapolation are obviously feasible .",
    "the value of @xmath189 in the table must be multiplied by the square of the applied field and by the cross sectional area of the sample in the @xmath3 plane , then divided by @xmath133 ( which is again a material - dependent parameter ) , to obtain the expected value of the magnetic moment amplitude to be observed .",
    "the table covers anisotropy parameter @xmath67 values up to 50 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath189 on its arguments is weak , less important than the unavoidable uncertainty in the values of the experimental input parameters such as those that go into e.g. the determination of @xmath133 .",
    "the slow dependence of @xmath189 on @xmath67 can be roughly understood as follows : the portion of the current loop which is along the @xmath5 direction does of course contribute to the magnetic moment .",
    "however , provided , as in the table , that @xmath200 the exact value of @xmath14 does not matter very much , since ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ nonlincur ] ) the decay of the nonlinear current is governed primarily by @xmath15 .",
    "the nonlinear moment is then limited by the smaller of the penetration depths .",
    "the slight downtrend with @xmath67 may be due to changes in the complicated current patterns discussed in connection with fig .",
    "[ nonlincur ] .",
    "the slight decrease with decreasing eccentricity is likely to be due to the influence of the @xmath142 component ( dominated by linear effects ) in a thicker crystal .",
    "the table indicates that flatter crystals are actually preferable to harder to obtain thick ones .",
    "again , however , a simple explanation in intuitive terms is hard to come by , since these results must be related to the intricacies of the nonlinear current patterns .",
    "finally we consider the sensitivity of our results to the unknown dependence of the order parameter on the crystallographic @xmath5 direction . in appendix a , we have calculated the coefficients of the nonlinear terms in the current ( as in eq .",
    "( [ jnl ] ) ) for the simplest form of the appropriate@xcite 3d op .",
    "we have verified that an increase occurs in the quantity @xmath189 but it is negated by a compensating increase in @xmath133 , where then one should replace @xmath201 by some average of in and out of plane correlation lengths .",
    "we conclude that the influence of any such dependence can be neglected as compared with the uncertainty in the material parameters .",
    "the detailed calculations for realistic samples performed here strongly confirm that the transverse magnetization effect should be readily observed in available crystals if the order parameter has nodes of the form expected for d - wave op symmetry . from our results , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ predict ] , it follows that the transverse magnetic moment generated in a typical sample of about 2 mm diameter and 0.1 mm thickness ( the precise thickness not being very important ) should be @xmath202 .",
    "these numbers are above what can be readily measured by standard experimental techniques : the rather high uncertainty levels quoted in past experiments@xcite arise from the geometrical problems described in the introduction and also from easy to overcome uncertainties@xcite in the angular positioning the sample .",
    "we have seen that the return currents in the z - direction produce an enhancement of the effect , although not nearly as large as that estimated in ref .. the effect of the boundary conditions and the finite size on the result is somewhat intricate and , perhaps not surprisingly , we have not been able to find a clear physical picture in terms of some nonlinear generalization of the demagnetization factors . although our results for the influence of sample geometry and anisotropy in penetration depth were not amenable to simple summing up either , the tabulated values of the quantity @xmath189 should facilitate experimental design and interpretation .    as briefly indicated in appendix a , ( see below eq.([phic ] ) )",
    "it is easy at @xmath7 to take into account different shapes of the d - wave order parameter function close to the nodes .",
    "our calculations can also be extended to other symmetries of the op , such as an @xmath203 or @xmath204 state , or to take into account dependence of the op in the c - direction . in the worst case , even at finite temperatures ,",
    "the functional @xmath36 could be , numerically evaluated and used in the calculations , although possibly at considerable cost in computer time , by means of a lookup table and interpolation scheme .",
    "we have not considered in this work the effect of impurities .",
    "this is unnecessary as it was shown in ref . that the impurity concentration required to noticeably decrease the nonlinear meissner effect at low temperatures",
    "is such that it would clearly reduce the transition temperature of the material .",
    "this result will not depend on the geometry of the sample . on the other hand ,",
    "we have considered here only the case where the order parameter has nodes , not just dips .",
    "the nonlinear effects are in fact extremely sensible to the presence of nodes and @xmath166 will decrease substantially , in finite as in infinite samples@xcite if an s - wave component eliminates the nodes .",
    "the magnitude of this decrease can be gauged from the infinite slab work@xcite since , again , it should not be excessively sensitive to return currents or sample shape .",
    "therefore , a negative experimental result could be used to put a _",
    "lower _ bound on the amount of s - wave component present .",
    "the methods discussed here can be extended to other sample shapes , to finite temperatures , and to the computation of other measurable effects that arise from the same nonlinear phenomena .",
