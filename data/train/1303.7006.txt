    "natural selection acts on phenotypes , however , in general , there will not be a one - to - one mapping between phenotypes and genotypes , but instead many genotypes can code for the same phenotype . as has been shown , for small population sizes ( @xmath5 ) , where populations are largely monomorphic",
    ", genotype - phenotype maps can give rise to a bias in evolution towards phenotypes with larger sequence entropy and in equilibrium is described by a balance between a tendency of phenotypes to increase their fitness and at the same time maximise their sequence entropy @xcite .",
    "this is embodied by the free fitness , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the malthusian fitness @xcite and @xmath10 is the sequence entropy , where @xmath11 is the equilibrium distribution of @xmath12 , the vector of traits and @xmath13 is the lagrange multiplier or effective inverse temperature of the canonical ensemble , which is linear in population size @xmath7 ; for the wright - fisher process @xmath14 and the moran process @xmath15 @xcite . in equilibrium ,",
    "the free fitness is maximised and the probability distribution of traits is boltzmann distributed , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .    out of equilibrium",
    ", we expect that stochastic dynamics will give rise to : 1 ) diffusion in phenotype space with diffusion constant @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is the mutation rate of all sites contributing to the phenotype ; 2 ) directed motion driven by gradients in the free fitness function with respect to changes in phenotype @xmath12 .",
    "the flux of probability in phenotype space will then be given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is a coefficient representing the strength of evolutionary change in response to an evolutionary force ( or gradient in free fitness ) and the factor of a @xmath20 for the mutation rate comes from converting from a discrete random walk to a continuous one .",
    "in equilibrium , detailed balance requires this flux to be zero , from which it is simple to show that    @xmath21    which is the evolutionary equivalent of the einstein relation that relates the friction constant to the diffusion constant of a brownian particle ; here the evolutionary friction constant @xmath19 is inversely proportional to the mutation rate and population size .",
    "we can now express the smoluchowski equation in its final form using the continuity equation , @xmath22 :    @xmath23    this smoluchowski equation can be converted to an equivalent set of stochastic differential equations @xcite    @xmath24    where @xmath25 corresponds to the @xmath26 trait of @xmath12 and where @xmath27 is a white noise gaussian process with moments @xmath28 & @xmath29 eqn.[eq : smoluchoskisdes ] , is a generalisation of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process for phenotypic evolution described in @xcite , but for an arbitrary free fitness landscape and including the correct population size dependence of the strength of the drift term via the einstein relation eqn.[eq : evolutionaryeinsteinrelation ] .",
    "the two - state approximation @xcite for transcription factor ( tf ) binding assumes that amino acid base pair hydrogen - binding energies are approximately additive and that each `` nonoptimal '' interaction increases the energy of binding by the same amount .",
    "this suggests replacing dna and amino acid sequences by binary strings .",
    "the binding energy is simply proportional to the hamming distance @xmath30 between a pair of binary sequences , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "we can assign a fitness @xmath33 to each value of @xmath34 , either arbitrarily or using some knowledge of the biophysics and function of a particular system . on the other hand ,",
    "the entropy is given directly by the nature of the binary model ; there are many sequences that give the same hamming distance , precisely @xmath35 , when @xmath36 , the sequence length , is large .",
    "so to a good approximation the sequence entropy is quadratic in hamming distance @xmath34 :    @xmath37    we see that entropy is maximised for @xmath38 , which corresponds to the hamming distance that has the largest number of genotypes coding it . in order to take advantage of the effective stochastic dynamics described in the previous section",
    ", we replace each sequence @xmath39 with a continuous variable @xmath40 and define a hamming distance like or binding energy variable as @xmath41 .",
    "further , we assume a simple quadratic fitness landscape @xmath42 . with sequence entropy given by eqn .",
    "[ eq : mutationalentropy ] , we have ( to within a constant ) the free fitness given by @xmath43 .    using eqn . [ eq : smoluchoskisdes ] , treating @xmath44 and @xmath45 as independent variables , we can write down a pair of stochastic differential equations describing the dynamics of the sequence - like variables in a quadratic landscape :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 , which is the curvature in the free fitness landscape and is a sum of the curvatures due to fitness and sequence entropy .",
    "in addition , we have used the fact that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the sign function that returns the sign of the argument .",
    "from eqn.[eq : smoluchoskisdesquadlandscape ] , fitness and sequence entropy balance ( maximum in free fitness ) for @xmath50 , so the free fitness is doubled peaked with a cusp valley at @xmath51 , except in the limit of an infinite population size ( @xmath52 ) . for the sake of analytical tractability , we can assume that each lineage is always confined to one or the other maximum , such that without loss of generality the initial condition @xmath53 remains true .",
    "this implies we can make the simplification @xmath54 , from which it follows :    @xmath55    where the characteristic relaxation rate of the system is given by @xmath56 .",
    "note that this system of equations is analogous to the dynamics of a pair of overdamped beads connected by spring with a temperature - dependent elastic constant . to solve these equations ,",
    "it is straightforward to take the laplace transform of these equations , solve the resulting matrix equation to give solutions in laplace space and find the inverse laplace transform to give    @xmath57    where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , the matrix @xmath60 is given by    @xmath61    and it is understood that the integral of the vector above is an element by element operation .",
    "there will be an equivalent set of stochastic differential equations for the second lineage of the same form as eqn.[eq : smoluchoskisdesquadlandscapesimple ] with solution @xmath62 given by eqn.[eq : x(t ) ] and binding energy @xmath63 with an identically distributed noise vector , but uncorrelated with the first lineage .",
    "if we let @xmath64 and @xmath65 and the hybrid binding energies be @xmath66 and @xmath67 , then it is straightforward to show using eqns.[eq : x(t ) ] , [ eq : j(t ) ] and the moments of the gaussian process that @xmath68 , where    @xmath69    we see that for long times ( @xmath70 ) , the average binding energy @xmath71 decays from the initial condition to its equilibrium value @xmath72 on the timescale @xmath73 ; in reality , using the full dynamics in eqn.[eq : smoluchoskisdesquadlandscape ] this variable would have zero mean in the long time limit , but as we see below the results are insensitive to this error .",
    "if we define the vector @xmath74 , we find that the covariance matrix @xmath75 is symmetric and has elements    @xmath76    we see for short times ( @xmath77 ) , the off - diagonal terms are zero , which suggests the binding energies of the two hybrids are uncorrelated .",
    "however , for long times ( @xmath78 ) they become anti - correlated , which shows , unlike at short times , the probability of both hybrids being incompatible are not independent .",
    "average hybrid fitness is then given by @xmath79 and we see that on long times it decreases like @xmath80 .",
    "a similar calculation of the variance on each lineage gives , @xmath81 which shows that , as expected , the co - evolutionary constraint of the free fitness landscape bounds the variance of binding energies on each lineage .",
    "so the variance in the hybrid binding energies is due to a pure diffusive term @xmath82 , which represents how the two lineages diffuse apart by independent mutations , plus a term which represents the saturating growth of variance of each lineage after divergence .",
    "the dynamics of the probability of a dmi for each hybrid , irrespective of whether the other hybrid has a dmi or not , is simply ,    @xmath83    where @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the threshold fitness below which an incompatibility arises in a hybrid .",
    "the variable @xmath86 is given by the sum of a number of gaussian processes , so @xmath87 itself must be gaussian ( with @xmath88 ) , which is completely specified by its mean ( eqn.[eq:<h>(t ) ] ) and variance @xmath89 , which can be directly calculated from eqns.[eq:<h>(t ) ] & [ eq:<h^2>(t ) ] . from eqn [ eq:<i>(t ) ] , the probability of a dmi is then simply an integral of a gaussian , which is expressed in terms of complementary error functions :    @xmath90    note that both the average hybrid fitness and the probability of incompatibilities ( eqn.[eq:<i>(t ) ] ) collapse to the same curves as a function of @xmath82 , for the same value of @xmath91 and when fitness is measured relative to the curvature @xmath92 .",
    "we can compare the analytical calculations of the previous section with numerical simulations of eqn .",
    "[ eq : smoluchoskisdesquadlandscape ] for a pair of lines diverging from a common ancestor , where no approximation is made regarding the values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the results of the simulations are averaged over @xmath93 independent realisations and all results assume an effective sequence length @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which is the mean value of @xmath97 in equilibrium .    in fig.[fig:<i(t ) > ] , we have plotted the probability of an incompatibility , for various values of @xmath98 , where solid lines are the analytical calculation and the dotted lines are from the numerical integration of eqn.[eq : smoluchoskisdesquadlandscape ] .",
    "firstly , we see that the analytical predictions compare very well to integrating the full stochastic differential equations , validating our simplifying assumptions .",
    "secondly , we see there is a large population size effect for the probability of an incompatibility ; the characteristic time for incompatibilities to arise is shorter as the population size decreases , where in addition for small populations ( @xmath99 ) there are two such characteristic timescales . in addition",
    ", we see that the dynamics of @xmath100 become insensitive to changes in population size both for small population sizes ( @xmath99 ) and large population sizes ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "note that , as we have not bounded the binding energies to a maximum value of @xmath36 , we would expect real sequences to have a smaller plateau value of @xmath102 in the long time limit of @xmath103 ; as we argue below it is the short time limit that is most relevant to speciation .    to understand this general behaviour",
    ", we can consider what happens in the phase space of @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the first lineage , versus the phase - space for @xmath44 and @xmath104 for the hybrids , as shown in fig.[fig : dmi_diagram ] .",
    "initially , both lineage and hybrid populations diffuse in a neutral and spherically symmetric manner ( like @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively ) up to the time @xmath107 , when the change in free fitness is of order the mean fitness @xmath108 and the accumulated variance of the hybrid population approaches the characteristic width of the potential @xmath109 . after this time",
    "the co - evolutionary constraint of the free fitness landscape is felt on each lineage and the probability density is then squeezed along a tube whose axis is defined by @xmath110 ( assuming an initial condition @xmath53 ) and width @xmath111 . as",
    "the marginal pdfs for @xmath44 and @xmath112 will be identical , the result is that in the hybrid phase - space , we have that the @xmath113 still grows in a spherically symmetric manner , as indicated by the term @xmath105 in eqn.[eq:<h^2>(t ) ] ; incompatibilities arise when hybrid populations have diffused to one or the other critical binding energy at @xmath114 . from eqn.[eq:<i>(t ) ] and fig.[fig : dmi_diagram ] , we see that there will in general be two characteristic times for dmis to arise , given by the condition that @xmath115 .",
    "it is then simple to see that in the limit of @xmath116 , @xmath117 and the time to diffuse to each boundary is the same as observed in fig.[fig:<i(t ) > ] .",
    "finally , for small population sizes ( @xmath118 ) @xmath119 , which shows the dynamics of dmis becomes independent of population size in this limit as well .",
    "it is clear that the population size dependence described here is likely to be also seen in more complex models of co - evolving loci as for a general free fitness landscape , the balance between sequence entropy and fitness is population size dependent , poising populations nearer or further away from such incompatible regions .    for the actual process of speciation",
    ", it will typically be the short - time behaviour that will dominate . given a large number @xmath120 of similar non - interacting clusters of loci , we would expect speciation when @xmath121 and so the critical probability of a dmi will be @xmath122 . as shown in the inset of fig.[fig:<i(t ) > ] , which is a plot of @xmath100 on a log - log scale together with the threshold probability @xmath123 , there is strong population size dependence on the time to speciation . in particular , we see this time is relatively insensitive to the exact value of @xmath124 , compared to the population size effect we describe and arises due to the steep gradient of @xmath100 at short times .",
    "the process of speciation underlies the vast diversity of life on earth .",
    "however , conventional models of speciation via dobzhansky - mller incompatibilities for geographically isolated populations with neutral divergence predict that speciation is independent of population size @xcite .",
    "however , such models are phenomenological with respect to the genetic basis of incompatibilities . here using the tools of stochastic dynamics and a simple biophysically motivated model for the genotype - phenotype map of protein binding dna , we have shown that there is a significant population size dependence of the time for hybrid incompatibilities to arise for independently evolving isolated populations under the same stabilising selection pressure .",
    "protein binding dna to control gene expression is a prototypical co - evolving system and critical for the proper development of organisms , thus these results have strong implications for the speciation rates and diversity of populations at small population sizes .",
    "we should note that our model does not account for differential selection across lineages , although it can easily be extended to do so , which can reinforce or have an opposite dependence on population size dependent on whether selection is beneficial or mildly deleterious @xcite ; the work here highlights a previously unanticipated population size dependence , which is necessary for a fully quantitative model of speciation ."

    "<S> it has since been understood that non - linear or epistatic interactions between different loci can give rise to so - called dobzhansky - mller incompatibilities @xcite between independently evolving lineages . for example , two lines evolving independently through geographic isolation ( allopatric evolution ) from a common ancestor _ ab _ , can fix the allelic combinations _ ab _ and _ ab _ respectively , yet the hybrid genotype @xmath4 is inviable .    field data @xcite suggest that the most dominant form of speciation does indeed involve geographically isolated populations with no or very little gene flow and that the mechanism is commonly via dobzhansky - mller incompatibilities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of models of allopatric speciation based on dobzhansky - mller incompatibilities , which consider independent lineages evolving neutrally or under varying selection pressures on each line @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we find , in contrast to current models , which predict no population size effect @xcite , that despite the two lines diverging neutrally , smaller populations have a higher rate of speciation as the effect of sequence entropy is to bias populations more closely to incompatible regions of phenotype space . </S>",
