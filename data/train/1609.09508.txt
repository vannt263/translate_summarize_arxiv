    "magnetic reconnection is invoked to explain plasma heating and energization in a variety of space environments , including earth s magnetosphere and the solar corona @xcite . despite kinetic numerical simulations and theoretical work @xcite ,",
    "it remains unclear precisely how magnetic energy is converted to particle kinetic energy during collisionless reconnection and how the conversion process depends on the plasma conditions .",
    "analysis of spacecraft data collected in earth s magneto - tail @xcite and a laboratory reconnection experiment @xcite suggest that @xmath0 of the magnetic energy released by reconnection is carried by the bulk electrons .",
    "we develop a model for the electron heating through the diffusion region of symmetric , anti - parallel magnetic reconnection .",
    "the diffusion region is a small volume where electron kinetic effects break the frozen flux condition , and it is a main focus of nasa s mms mission @xcite . while the electron heating in the diffusion region has been studied before @xcite , no previous model has offered predictions for how the electron temperature increase depends on the plasma conditions .    in previous work",
    ", we found that the electrons are energized anisotropically as they advect towards the x - line in the reconnection inflow @xcite .",
    "the fractional changes in parallel ( with respect to the local magnetic field ) and perpendicular temperatures turn out to scale in a predictable way with @xmath1 , the upstream ratio of electron to magnetic pressure . here",
    ", we consider how the dependence on @xmath1 extends into the electron energization within the diffusion region itself .",
    "the result is a model for the electron heating from upstream to the end of the diffusion region in which two main physical mechanisms operate : ( 1 ) the inflowing electrons are energized through an adiabatic trapping process @xcite and ( 2 ) the reconnection electric field then does additional work on a current sheet carried by meandering electrons within the diffusion region @xcite .",
    "relatively simple estimates developed here predict the additional heating within the diffusion region up to a factor of order unity that is determined empirically from kinetic simulations .",
    "the simulations cover a wide range of @xmath1 , and they demonstrate the limit of validity of the adiabatic model .    the net increase in the electron temperature is found to scale roughly as @xmath2 .",
    "this scaling is consistent with a survey of themis magnetopause reconnection observations @xcite . in the observations , the electron temperature increase @xmath3 from the inflow to the exhaust at least tens of ion inertial lengths downstream from the x - line scales with the upstream alfven speed squared , @xmath4 , which is equivalent to @xmath2 for anti - parallel symmetric reconnection .",
    "because only a small portion of the electrons in the far exhaust have passed directly through the diffusion region , it is not clear that the temperature scaling for the diffusion region and farther downstream should be the same .",
    "there is numerical evidence , however , that the diffusion region heating is related to the downstream temperature . in a numerical scaling study @xcite , the peak electron temperature was found to become nearly uniform from the end of the diffusion region out @xmath5 @xmath6 into the exhaust .",
    "additional evidence comes from the electron temperature illustrated in figs  [ fig : teopen](a - d ) at late times from a particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation of anti - parallel reconnection ( similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , but with an ion - to - electron temperature ratio of 5 and background density of 0.25 the peak harris density ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : teopen](e ) shows the time evolution of the electron temperature along the mid - plane ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "note that the peak electron temperature is reached first at the end of the diffusion region near @xmath8 , and this value then fills the exhaust as reconnected field lines are advected downstream at the outflow velocity .",
    "this suggests that additional energization processes @xcite allow the elevated temperature set in the diffusion region to fill the exhaust as reconnected flux is carried downstream .",
    "furthermore , the formation of magnetic islands within the diffusion region interrupts the diffusion region heating .",
    "the exhaust electron temperature in the affected flux tubes remains decreased as the reconnected plasma travels downstream .",
    "this modulation of the exhaust temperature is noticeable on both sides of the x - line , not only the side that contains the ejected island . because reconnection is driven by steady inflow boundary conditions in this simulation , neither the global reconnection rate nor the overall geometry of the exhaust without an island changes .",
    "this provides further evidence that the initial heating in the diffusion region plays some role in setting the ultimate temperature of the downstream exhaust .    in section  [ sec : pic ]",
    ", we describe the pic simulations we use to guide and confirm our model of electron heating .",
    "the kinetic energization processes and their resulting electron velocity distributions are presented in section  [ sec : pdf ] .",
    "some details of a previous inflow heating ( section  [ sec : inflow ] ) model and a new simplified diffusion region heating model ( section  [ sec : edr ] ) follow .",
    "to study electron energization in the diffusion region , we performed a series of 2d pic simulations of anti - parallel harris sheet reconnection using the code vpic @xcite with open boundary conditions @xcite . in our coordinates ,",
    "the initial magnetic field and density are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath12 cells @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ion inertial length based on the peak density @xmath15 .",
    "other parameters are initial uniform temperatures with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 particles per species per cell .",
    "we use a mass ratio of @xmath19 because a ratio of @xmath20 is necessary to capture the dynamics of electrons that follow adiabatic trapped orbits @xcite .",
    "the background density @xmath21 is varied so the initial upstream electron beta is @xmath22 with @xmath23 .    besides the main scan with varying @xmath21",
    ", we test the dependence of the electron heating on upstream electron temperature @xmath24 with two additional runs performed at fixed @xmath25 , with @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the harris sheet electron temperature ) . to study the dependence on mass ratio , we use three runs reported on previously @xcite with varying mass ratio @xmath31 .",
    "finally , while an exhaustive parameter scan is not feasible in 3d , data from the 3d run of @xcite ( with @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) is presented and is consistent with the model .",
    "indeed , 3d effects @xcite have been found not to substantially alter the dynamics of anti - parallel reconnection in typical magnetospheric regimes with @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "each simulation was run until reconnection reached a quasi - steady state .",
    "typical field profiles during quasi - steady reconnection are plotted in fig .",

    "the electron temperature @xmath45 is plotted in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : box](c ) ] is a typical trapped distribution that is elongated in the parallel ( @xmath46 ) direction @xcite .    the electron orbit in fig .  [ fig : box](b ) then undergoes meandering motion @xcite within the diffusion region and oscillates across the inner current layer .",
    "here within the diffusion region itself , the velocity distributions more finely structured .",
    "as electrons meander across the central sheet , they gain energy from the reconnection electric field @xmath49 .",
    "this process produces a distribution with a striated triangular tail extended in @xmath50 near the x - line [ as in figs .",
    "[ fig : box](d ) ] @xcite , where each striation is composed of electrons that bounced a set number times across the diffusion region layer .",
    "further downstream , the reconnected magnetic field component @xmath51 mixes the striations [ fig .",
    "[ fig : box](e ) ] @xcite . finally , in the exhaust [ fig .",
    "[ fig : box](f ) ] , the typical electron orbits include regions of chaotic motion , and pitch angle mixing produces nearly isotropic velocity distributions @xcite .",
    "as far as bulk energization , the electron distributions thus indicate two separate processes . first , the inflow trapping elongates the velocity distributions and increases the effective parallel temperature by @xmath52 while adiabatic cooling from @xmath39 conservation leads to a decrease @xmath53 .",
    "we denote the initial total temperature increment @xmath54 .",
    "next , the meandering electrons within the diffusion region are accelerated to larger @xmath55 by the reconnection electric field , forming the tips of the triangular velocity distributions .",
    "chaotic mixing finally produces isotropic distributions in the exhaust with an increased effective temperature @xmath56 .",
    "we refer to this additional temperature increase within the diffusion region as @xmath57 . both @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "depend on the upstream plasma conditions .",
    "the differences at varying @xmath1 are evident in the velocity distributions computed near the x - line in figs .",
    "[ fig : box](g ) and ( h ) .",
    "the distributions are only mildly anisotropic and have a small tail accelerated by @xmath49 at @xmath60 , while there is strong anisotropy and a tail accelerated to large @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "we now review a model for the inflow heating @xmath58 and develop estimates for the diffusion region heating @xmath59 to determine how the temperature increments scale with the plasma parameters .",
    "our results for the inflow heating derive from the fact that the electron temperature anisotropy and the pseudo - potential @xmath37 saturate when the electrons approach the firehose instability threshold , @xmath63 .",
    "this follows from gross momentum balance , which requires electron anisotropy to balance a large fraction of the @xmath64 magnetic `` tension '' force on the electron jets that flow in the diffusion region .",
    "typically , the electron temperature anisotropy therefore peaks at a value @xmath65 immediately upstream from the electron jets @xcite .",
    "we follow the method of @xcite to estimate the inflow anisotropic heating .",
    "first , upstream parameters @xmath21 , @xmath66 , and @xmath24 are found @xmath67 upstream from the x - line to use in normalizing the equations of state for the inflow electrons .",
    "these may differ by up to @xmath68 from the initial asymptotic values .",
    "next , we numerically solve @xmath69 based on the equations of state for adiabatically trapped electrons , @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite , to determine the magnetic field strength @xmath72 upstream from the diffusion region , measured where the electron current falls to @xmath73 of its peak value .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bheos](a ) .",
    "note that for anti - parallel reconnection , the equations of state do not apply in the center of the diffusion region where the electron orbits are unmagnetized .",
    "although they typically break down before the value @xmath72 is reached , the equations of state at the firehose threshold give a good estimate for the magnetic field immediately outside the current layer .",
    "finally , it is found empirically that evaluating the equations of state with @xmath74 ( the factor of 1.1 provides a better fit over the larger range of @xmath1 studied here than the factor of 1.25 used originally in @xcite ) and @xmath75 yields good estimates for both the peak pseudo - potential @xmath37 and the electron temperatures @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "see fig .",

    "the model of @xcite was confirmed numerically for a somewhat limited range of @xmath1 .",
    "meanwhile , additional simulations @xcite showed that the adiabatic model breaks down at low @xmath78 . the range of @xmath1 considered here covers the span of parameters from low @xmath1 where the adiabatic model begins to fail to high @xmath1 where the weak inflow heating is very difficult to resolve both in spacecraft data and in particle - in - cell simulations . predictions and simulation data are plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : curves ] . for low @xmath1 , the adiabatic model outlined above predicts the pseudo - potential scales as @xmath79 , the peak temperature anisotropy scales as @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "our scan of kinetic runs demonstrates that the parallel pseudo - potential in the inflow becomes larger than predicted by the adiabatic model at very low @xmath1 .",
    "the peak temperature anisotropy @xmath82 decreases somewhat .",

    "the net energization @xmath83 is greater than predicted by the adiabatic model .",
    "a simplified model is derived below that reproduces the scalings with plasma parameters we observe in a large number of kinetic simulations , even though it uses several approximations concerning the morphology of the electron diffusion region current layers .",
    "a single overall coefficient of order unity is determined empirically to fit the model to the simulation data . to estimate the diffusion region heating",
    ", we consider the electron conservation equations for mass , momentum , and energy over a control volume that covers the diffusion region of length @xmath84 and width @xmath85 24@xmath86 .",

    "while a previous study found that the size of the diffusion region scales as @xmath87 @xcite , our runs did not confirm this scaling .",
    "the precise length of the diffusion region may be sensitive to boundary conditions and the time selected for measuring its length . in any case",
    ", the nominal sizes we choose are sufficient for our estimates within the range of parameters relevant to magnetospheric reconnection that we consider .",
    "number or mass conservation demands that the inflowing flux of electrons @xmath88 and the diffusion region exhaust flux @xmath89 be equal , and we denote this single particle flux @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , a current sheet supported by anisotropy consistent with the equations of state for the inflowing electrons also requires that the magnetic field strength just upstream from the electron jet be uniform and equal to the value @xmath72 . by ampere s law ,",
    "this magnetic field is proportional to the net current in the sheet .",
    "while maintaining its magnitude @xmath72 , the magnetic field rotates in direction with the electron flow @xcite .",
    "as shown previously @xcite , the peak net out - of - plane flux within the diffusion region is therefore also of the same order as the in - plane flux , @xmath91 .",
    "the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : uex ] show the electron outflow jets , and the right - hand panels show mean electron flow profiles @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 averaged over the width of the diffusion region . at higher @xmath1 , the peak @xmath95 does not reach the peak @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "this approximation concerning the magnitude of the electron fluxes is thus roughest in the high @xmath1 cases where the electron jets do not flow much faster than the background alfvenic outflow . in these cases ,",
    "the diffusion region electron heating is small , and it is at the limit of resolution in both pic simulations and spacecraft observations .    as confirmed by the kinetic simulations , the main contributions to energy balance integrated over the diffusion region are advection across the boundaries and work done through @xmath97 .",
    "an exception is at the lowest @xmath1 of @xmath98 , where the thermal heat flux driven by instabilities carries nearly @xmath99 of the energy dissipated by @xmath97 .",
    "the electric field does work on the electrons ( per unit length in the out - of - plane direction ) of size @xmath100 where the factor of @xmath101 accounts for the current density profile falling off from its peak value at the center of the sheet . for our estimates , we take a typical value for the reconnection electric field of @xmath102 , although @xmath103 tends to decrease with increasing upstream density @xcite",
    ". meanwhile , the net electron thermal energy advected out of the box is @xmath104 balancing the contributions from eqs .",
    "[ eq : edotj ] and [ eq : pu ] , the temperature change across the diffusion region is @xmath105 , or in terms of the upstream conditions , @xmath106 our approximations , which include neglecting the precise current and field profiles , turn out to overestimate the diffusion region heating .",
    "we thus introduce the factor of @xmath107 to fit the simulation data .",
    "the model predictions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta](a ) .",
    "the model for first stage of heating , involving adiabatic trapping in the inflow , predicts both @xmath52 and @xmath108 , and the predictions are plotted along with the total @xmath58 .",
    "contrary to predictions , @xmath109 increases somewhat for @xmath78 .",
    "this results from non - adiabatic motion and streaming instabilities , and it highlights the need for an extended model at low @xmath1 . also plotted is the model for the second stage of heating within the diffusion region @xmath59 based on eq .",
    "[ eq : test ] .",
    "note that @xmath59 in eq .",
    "[ eq : test ] scales as @xmath110 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : delta](c ) for numerical results ] . on the other hand , @xmath58 is independent of the mass ratio as long as the trapped electron bouncing motion is adiabatic ( usually for @xmath111 ) .",
    "the net temperature change @xmath112 therefore scales more weakly than @xmath110 ( similar to @xcite ) , although our model predicts that it in fact does not follow any simple power law in @xmath113 .",
    "the results highlight that care must be taken when comparing various heating processes in kinetic simulations to observational data because different processes depend on the numerical parameters , such as mass ratio , in different ways . at the physical mass ratio of @xmath31=1836 , the diffusion region heating of our model will typically be of a similar magnitude or smaller than the inflow heating .    evaluating the model for the total temperature jump @xmath114 at the physical proton mass ratio yields the black curve fig .  [",
    "fig : delta](c ) .",
    "it compares favorably to , though it is slightly lower than , the empirical scaling @xmath115 ( red curve ) determined from the themis survey of reconnection exhausts in magnetopause crossings @xcite .",
    "observational data points from events with a weak guide field , corresponding to magnetic shear angles @xmath116 , are also plotted .",
    "the empirical scaling is equivalent to @xmath117 for weak guide fields , and the data are re - plotted normalized to @xmath118 in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta](d ) .",
    "the model is consistent with the scaling @xmath119 to a good approximation for @xmath120 .",
    "again , it is somewhat unexpected that our model based on the diffusion region agrees fairly well with spacecraft data collected possibly @xmath121 @xmath6 @xcite downstream from the x - line .",
    "this is consistent , however , with numerical calculations that show a uniform electron exhaust temperature @xcite and the relationship between the diffusion region dynamics and the downstream temperature presented in the introduction . in the run of fig .",
    "[ fig : teopen ] , islands within the diffusion region temporarily reduce the length of the electron current sheet by as much as 50% , and as a result @xmath122 is reduced from @xmath123 ( in agreement with eq .",
    "[ eq : test ] ) to @xmath124@xmath125 .",
    "the dip in temperature persists more than 100 @xmath6 downstream into the exhaust .",
    "the model for electron heating has a couple of implications for high - resolution electron measurements such as those available from the mms mission .",
    "first , it could possibly be combined with other methods , for example analyzing the striated diffusion region electron distributions @xcite , to help place constraints on the size of @xmath103 and the reconnection rate .",
    "furthermore , the model suggests that the diffusion region striated electron distributions should be most apparent in low @xmath1 reconnection . in this regime , @xmath122 may be larger than the upstream @xmath109 , and the striations should therefore be distinctly separated @xcite .",
    "in summary , a model for the diffusion region in symmetric anti - parallel reconnection predicts the electron heating .",
    "the first stage of energization occurs in the inflow because of adiabatic trapping , and it results in anisotropic heating with @xmath126 and @xmath127 described by known equations of state . as demonstrated by our simulations spanning a wide range of @xmath1 , an extended model will have to be formulated for low @xmath78 when the adiabatic assumption breaks down . in the next stage ,",
    "meandering electrons in the diffusion region are further energized by the reconnection electric field , and the temperature increases by an additional amount @xmath59 .",
    "it is worth noting that , unlike the adiabatic inflow heating for @xmath128 , the diffusion region heating is sensitive to the mass ratio employed in numerical simulations .",
    "we developed a simple scaling law for this additional heating @xmath122 , and the composite two - stage model agrees with an empirical scaling based on spacecraft measurements taken downstream in the reconnection exhaust . while it was not evident that the diffusion region heating could affect the temperature far downstream , this dependence is consistent with simulations that show a flux tube retains the temperature set in the diffusion region as it is advected far into the exhaust .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the individual anisotropic increases @xmath129 and @xmath53 of the inflow depend sensitively on @xmath24 , the predicted total heating @xmath114 turns out to be roughly proportional to @xmath130 to a good approximation for @xmath131 .",
    "this scaling also held in the magnetopause observations @xcite and a previous numerical scaling study @xcite .",
    "a fluid model based on magnetized electrons appropriate for reconnection with a guide field also resulted in a nearly identical scaling for the electron temperature in the exhaust @xcite . in the fluid model",
    ", the electron heating is related to overall pressure balance of the reconnection exhaust . for guide fields that are not too large",
    ", force balance requires the plasma pressure in the current sheet to compensate some significant fraction of the upstream magnetic pressure @xmath132 .",
    "it is thus natural that the total electron heating scales with the upstream magnetic pressure .",
    "the predicted level of heating and partition of energy between electrons and ions , however , depends in addition on the assumed equations of state for each species .",
    "adiabatic ion and double adiabatic electron closures yielded good results , suggesting heat transport is somehow limited .",
    "the observational survey @xcite and numerical study @xcite included a range of guide magnetic fields and plasma parameters .",
    "meanwhile , it has been found that the mechanisms that energize the electrons in the far exhaust  such as parallel electric field acceleration and drifts in perpendicular fields @xcite  play relatively smaller or larger roles depending on the strength of the guide field @xcite .",
    "it thus remains an open question how various electron processes , from adiabatic electric trapping to meandering diffusion region orbits to fermi bounce acceleration in the far exhaust , conspire to yield relatively uniform electron temperature profiles that obey a simple scaling law to a good approximation for a broad range of plasma parameters found in the magnetosphere .",
