    "data taken in hall b at jefferson laboratory have recently been published on polarization transfer in the reaction @xmath5 @xcite . while these data have been used to shed light on the @xmath6 quark pair creation operator in the associated strangeness production reaction",
    ", they can not yet provide direct constraints on the isobar models commonly employed to describe the reaction mechanism @xcite . these phenomenological models  ( e.g.@xcite ) rely on fitting the available data to provide constraints on the contributing intermediate - state resonant and non - resonant processes in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 reaction channels .",
    "the models differ in the set of specific resonant states included , as well as in their treatment of hadronic form factors and the restoration of gauge invariance .",
    "however , due to the sparsity of data for this reaction and the large number of parameters in the models , the contributions to the intermediate state remain largely unconstrained and , therefore , are highly uncertain .",
    "the new polarization transfer data are difficult to include in fitting the isobar model parameters .",
    "this is due to the fact that , by necessity , these data were averaged over a large range in momentum transfer @xmath3 ( 0.3 to 1.5  gev@xmath4 ) and a large range in the invariant energy @xmath2 ( @xmath10200  mev bins ) .",
    "the data have also been averaged over all @xmath11 , the angle between the electron scattering plane and the @xmath12 hadronic reaction plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig - kin ] )",
    ". one could expect significant variations in the model parameters over such large kinematic ranges .",
    "this means that including these data , say at their central kinematic values , into a global refit of the parameters is improper .",
    "therefore these data have been employed only as a cross check of the model parameters based on fits to other measured observables .",
    "the transferred polarization data can , however , provide useful new direct constraints to the models when they are used to extract the ratio of longitudinal to transverse structure functions , @xmath13 .",
    "this ratio has been previously measured using a rosenbluth separation @xcite .",
    "the results presented here provide a means of extracting @xmath14 that is less prone to systematic uncertainties than the rosenbluth method and give results that are systematically slightly smaller .",
    "following the notation of ref .",

    "the transferred polarization can also be defined in the @xmath47 coordinate system where @xmath48 is along the virtual photon direction , @xmath49 is normal to the electron scattering plane , and @xmath50 ( see fig .  [ fig - kin ] ) .",
    "the components of @xmath39 in the @xmath47 system are related to those in the @xmath19 system by a simple rotation and are given by : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the @xmath21 c.m .",

    "@xcite cites an absolute systematic error of less than 0.08 for each polarization point . assuming a comparable systematic uncertainty for the extrapolated polarization at @xmath86 leads to the estimated systematic uncertainties on @xmath72 given in the table",
    "the resulting values for @xmath72 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - rlt_ave ] . for comparison ,",
    "we have also included the previously published data  @xcite .",
    "we see that our results for @xmath72 using polarization transfer data are consistently smaller than the previous data obtained using the more common rosenbluth separation method . in this method ,",
    "the unpolarized cross section at a given @xmath3 and @xmath2 is measured in parallel kinematics as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "the cross section reduces to @xmath88 . in principle , fitting the cross section data with a straight line gives @xmath89 and @xmath70 . however , this technique relies on a very precise determination of the absolute cross section at all @xmath87 points . to illustrate the inherent difficulties of this technique , one only needs to compare the results of niculescu  @xcite with those of mohring  @xcite .",
    "these are two analyses of the _ same _ data set taken in hall c of jefferson lab .",
    "the mohring results were published later and are generally believed to be more reliable .",
    "these data were measured at @xmath2=1.84  gev  the same as our middle data point .",
    "our own results are strikingly different than the niculescu results and are slightly lower than  although within uncertainties of  the results of mohring for points at comparable kinematics ( lower two @xmath3 points ) .",
    "we also observe that our highest @xmath3 point is consistent with zero to within the extracted uncertainty .",
    "again , comparison of this point to the results of mohring is probably inappropriate because of the low average value of @xmath2 for our point .",
    "our result implies a small longitudinal structure function and hence a small longitudinal coupling of the virtual photon .",
    "in fact , at the highest @xmath3 point ( lowest @xmath2 ) our result is consistent with @xmath90 . this structure function is expected to be very sensitive to the kaon form factor  @xcite . a recently conducted experiment in hall",
    "a at jefferson laboratory  @xcite has as one of its main goals a rosenbluth separation at several values of momentum transfer @xmath8 leading to a chew - low extrapolation  @xcite of the kaon form factor .",
    "however , this method relies on having small _ relative _ uncertainties for @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath89 is as small as our results indicate , it seems unlikely that a reliable determination of the kaon form factor can be performed at these kinematics .",
    "a more significant discrepancy between rosenbluth and polarization - transfer results was previously observed in measurements of the ratio of the proton s electric and magnetic form factors , @xmath91 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the common wisdom is that the polarization - transfer method is much less susceptible to systematic errors .",
    "if one believes that the polarization transfer results are correct , then the slope derived from the rosenbluth technique is too large .",
    "this is similar to what is implied by our results .",
    "one explanation that is being widely discussed is that there is an @xmath87-dependent , two - photon - exchange effect that has not been properly accounted for in the radiative corrections applied to the experimental cross sections @xcite .",
    "some calculations  @xcite indicate that including this effect would bring down the high @xmath87 data points relative to the low @xmath87 data points and lead to better agreement between the rosenbluth and polarization - transfer results .",
    "it is certainly premature to attribute the small differences between rosenbluth results and our polarization - transfer results for @xmath12 electroproduction to two - photon exchange .",
    "however , it is interesting that the trend of the differences is in the same direction as observed in the @xmath91 results .",
    "we would like to note that the polarization transfer data from which we extracted @xmath72 is just the first to come out of a larger program of kaon electroproduction in hall b  @xcite at jefferson lab .",
    "analysis is currently underway in which cross sections and polarization observables will be measured covering @xmath2 from threshold up to 3.0  gev and @xmath3 from 0.3 up to 5  gev@xmath4 .",
    "these data will yield a factor of 4 better statistical uncertainty for the @xmath17 polarization transfer , thus leading to a more reliable determination of @xmath72 .",
    "additional back - angle data will also allow extraction of @xmath72 in anti - parallel kinematics .",
    "in addition , hall b will produce its own rosenbluth separation that will complement both the existing data and results that are expected soon from hall a  @xcite .",
    "we are eager to see if the apparent small differences between the two techniques of extracting @xmath72 hold up with the coming results or are simply a case of statistical fluctuations .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have done the first extraction of the ratio @xmath92 from transferred polarization data for the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "our results are systematically lower than the results obtained by the rosenbluth technique and are also significantly different from model predictions .",
    "these results indicate a small longitudinal structure function for @xmath3 of around 0.7  gev@xmath4 and @xmath2 of 1.72 , 1.84 , and 1.98  gev ."
