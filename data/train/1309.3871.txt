    "the spin dynamics and spin transport in semiconductor nano - structures have attracted much attention in the past decade due to the potential applications of the spintronic devices.@xcite the spin transport in semiconductors can be described by a set of key parameters such as the spin relaxation time @xmath1 , spin mobility @xmath2 and spin diffusion coefficient ( sdc ) @xmath3 .",
    "these parameters can be directly extracted from the temporal evolution of optically excited spin density wave ( sdw).@xcite since the optically excited electrons are inevitably accompanied by an equal number of positively charged holes , the interplay between charge diffusion and spin diffusion of electrons and holes is an important problem .",
    "so far , the spin and charge dynamics are usually studied separately by using different experimental setups . in the transient grating experiments , one can study the ambiplor transport by creating a pure charge density wave ( cdw ) without spin polarization using two parallel linearly polarized laser beams.@xcite in the transient spin grating experiments , however , one studies the spin dynamics by using two orthogonal linearly polarized laser beams to create the mixture of a pure electron and hole sdws with spatial homogeneous carrier concentrations .",
    "the problem is further simplified in @xmath4 or @xmath5 gaas quantum wells ( qws ) , since the hole spins quickly disappear in subpicoseconds , leaving only the electron sdw together with the spatial homogeneous and unpolarized hole gases.@xcite the amplitude decay rates of the electron sdw is characterized by electron spin lifetime @xmath6 and sdc @xmath7 . in @xmath0 gaas qws , the electron and hole sdws can coexist over a few hundred picoseconds , as the hole spin lifetime can be comparable or even larger than that of electrons in the special case of the cancellation of the dresselhaus and rashba terms in the spin - orbit coupling ( soc).@xcite it is expected that @xmath0 gaas qws would provide unique playgrounds to show the rich physics when the spin and charge degrees of freedom of both electrons and holes interplay with each other comparing to @xmath4 or @xmath5 qws .    recently , there are some experiments on the dynamics and transport in the case when the charge and spin inhomogeneity coexist . in the transmission - grating - photomasked transient spin grating experiments ,",
    "a spin polarized carrier grating is generated by a circularly polarized laser beam.@xcite similarly , a spin polarized charge package can be generated by a tightly focused circularly polarized laser beam.@xcite in the system where the spatial profiles of the sdw and cdw overlap , the spin and charge diffusions of both carriers are assumed to be governed by the ambipolar diffusion , since the spins are attached to the carriers.@xcite the sdc can be further reduced and become smaller than the charge diffusion coefficient ( cdc ) if the spin coulomb drag is taken into consideration.@xcite however , the validity of the assumption that spin and charge motions are bound together in the case of spatial overlapping of sdw and cdw has never been justified beyond hand - waving arguments.@xcite when the carriers are fully spin polarized , the motion of the spins are identical to that of the charges . in this case",
    ", it is expected that the motions of spins and charges are indeed bound together .",
    "however , it is not necessary so when carriers have different spins .",
    "a simple example is that when there are two electrons with opposite spins moving with the same velocity but in opposite directions , there is a spin current but no overall charge current .",
    "therefore , the spin motion can be separated from the charge motion when the system is not fully polarized . in the charge homogeneous system",
    "where pure spin current can flow without the accompanying of a charge current , the spin - charge separation ( scs ) is almost taken for granted .",
    "for the spatially overlapped cdw and sdw , the interplay between the charge and spin diffusion is more complex . unfortunately , a solid theoretical investigation on the effect of the interplay on the spin and charge motions from microscopic approach has not yet been carried out up to date .",
    "the possibility of the scs in such system has not yet been explored . in this letter , we study the transport of a spin polarized cdw ( spcdw ) , which can be excited optically@xcite and has both charge and spin spatial inhomogeneities , in gaas ( 111 ) qws , where both electron and hole spins can survive long enough@xcite to show the effect of the interplay between the charge and spin .",
    "we show that , contradicting to the currently accepted notion , the spin and charge motions are bound together only in the fully polarized system , but can be separated in the system with low spin polarization or short spin lifetime .",
    "we further demonstrate that , in the case of the scs the coulomb drag between electrons and holes greatly enhances the hole spin diffusion since the electron spins move much faster than the hole spins .",
    "when the spin polarization is high enough , the spin coulomb drag can boost the hole sdc by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "we study the transport of spin polarized electron and hole gases in nonmagnetic gaas qws grown along the @xmath8-axis .",
    "one can write down the kinetic spin bloch equations ( ) as following,@xcite @xmath9 + { \\partial\\rho_i(x,\\mathbf{k},t)\\over\\partial t}\\bigr|_{\\mathtt{s } } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we assume that the transport direction is along the @xmath10-axis and the carriers only occupy the lowest subbands .",

    "the scattering terms consist of the contributions from all the relevant scatterings , including the carrier - impurity , carrier - phonon and carrier - carrier coulomb scatterings .",
    "the expression for the hatree - fock and scattering terms can be found in refs .",
    "it is noted that the ksbes are valid for the time shorter than the recombination time , which is in the order of a few hundreds pico - seconds in gaas , since we have ignored the recombination of the electrons and holes in the ksbes .",
    "the spin and charge degree of freedom of the electrons and holes have many different combinations .",
    "all of these combinations can be described in our model using different parameters , including those discussed in ref .  .",

    "\\label{eq : spin_drag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these equations describe vast different transport scenarios under different conditions .",
    "we should first focus on the case when the coulomb drag is not important . in the traditional non - polarized ambipolar transport problem ,",
    "the carrier diffusion results in the charge inbalance in space and induces a nonzero electric field even if there is no applied electric field , due to the difference between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the electron and hole cdcs .",
    "this induced electric field prevents the further growth of the charge inbalance and results in the nearly neutral charge concentration in space .",
    "consequently , even though @xmath66 and @xmath67 are quite different , the electron and hole diffusion are characterized by a single ambipolar diffusion coefficient ( adc)@xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the electron and hole conductances , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 being the electron and hole mobilities , respectively .",
    "theoretically , this is obtained by removing the term involving @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ni ] ) and then setting @xmath74 to enforce the charge neutrality.@xcite    the spin diffusion is more complex than the charge diffusion .",
    "when both electrons and holes are fully spin polarized , such as in the intrinsic ( undoped ) system where nearly all the carriers are optically excited , one can easily see that the evolution of charges and spins are described by the same equations .",
    "therefore , in this special case the spins are indeed bound to the charges .",
    "the sdcs for both electron and hole should also be the adc .    however , the situation is quite different if there are unpolarized background charges , such as in the doped nonmagnetic qws . in this situation ,",
    "it is not longer appropriate to follow the stand procedure to enforce the charge neutrality for the spcdw . to study the dynamics of non - fully polarized spcdw",
    ", one has to solve the coupled ksbes and poisson equations self - consistently without artificially imposing the charge neutrality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ni ] ) . to achieve this",
    ", we use the periodic boundary condition and rewrite the simplified transport and poisson equations in the form of the fourier components for charge concentrations and spin polarization , eg . , @xmath75 .",
    "limited to the linear order of excited charge concentrations , we find that only @xmath76 components are relevant and obtain the following solution for the charge concentrations , @xmath77 }    \\bigr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where to the quadratic term of @xmath31 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the solution shows that electrons and holes indeed diffuse together as a bundle with the adc @xmath80 except a small difference that results in a small charge imbalance , @xmath81 ( e^{-\\lambda_-t}-e^{-\\lambda_+t}),\\ ] ] which induces an electric field that prevents the further growth of the charge imbalance .    using the above result for the charge concentrations ,",
    "one then obtains the equations for the spin diffusion , @xmath82 the first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff - ele - spin ] ) is the generation of the sdw from spin - charge coupling between the spatial homogeneous spin polarization and cdw .",
    "the generation rates are proportional to the charge inbalance and the homogeneous spin polarization .",
    "it should be noted that this sdw generation from the cdw is purely from the orbital motion and requires initial spin polarization .",
    "this should not be confused with the sdw generation from the cdw due to the soc.@xcite the last two terms are diffusion and relaxation of the sdw , respectively .",
    "these equations show that the sdw diffuses independently with different sdcs @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) , same as the individual cdcs .",
    "this contradicts to all previous assumptions that the sdc should also be the adc @xmath80 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : da ] ) ] , based on the assumption that carrier spin degrees of freedom are bound to the charge degrees of freedom .",
    "the difference between the charge diffusion and spin diffusion originates from the fact that spin diffusion does not necessarily result in charge inbalance even when the spatial profiles of the cdw and sdw overlap with each other , such as the case of spcdw . for example , for spcdw in @xmath85-type qws or spcdw with low spin polarization , the change in electron concentration caused by the spin - up electrons diffusing from left to right can be compensated by the one caused by spin - down electrons moving in the opposite direction .",
    "the net effect of this process is the pure spin diffusion that reduces the spin polarization without any accompanied charge diffusion .",
    "therefore , the spin motion can be separated from the charge motion . in the case of scs ,",
    "the electron and hole sdcs can be quite different from each other .",
    "the difference between the charge and spin diffusion can be further enhanced by the coulomb drag between electron and hole spin currents when the spin polarization is high enough .",
    "the above simplified ksbes can only qualitatively describe the temporal evolution of the spcdw . especially , eq .  ( [ eq : diff - ele - spin ] ) is valid when the spin polarization and the effect of the coulomb drag are small . to justify the existence of the scs in genuine situation and to study the effect of the coulomb drag",
    ", we now turn to the numerical solution of the full ksbes , which include all the relevant scatterings , such as the carrier - impurity , carrier - phonon as well as carrier - carrier coulomb scatterings , for the spcdw in @xmath0 gaas qws .",
    "we choose the out - of - plane electric field @xmath86 , which modifies the strength of the soc,@xcite in a regime not far away from cancellation point of the hole soc , so that the spin lifetimes of electron and hole are long enough . from the expressions of the soc [ eqs .",

    "one obtains the corresponding decay rates , which are functions of the wave - vector @xmath31 .",
    "the decay rates can be fitted using quadratic functions @xmath95 to obtain the diffusion coefficients @xmath38.@xcite    in figs .",

    "we first focus on the case of low initial spin polarization .",
    "we find that the numerical results for @xmath97% quantitatively confirm the analytical results presented in the previous section .",
    "namely , the charge transports are ambipolar diffusion , described by the adc @xmath80 , and the motions of the charges and spins are separated .",
    "the electron scs becomes obvious once one considers the difference between the electron sdc @xmath101 ( about @xmath102  @xmath103/s ) and @xmath80 ( about @xmath104  @xmath103/s ) . for hole sdw , even though the sdc @xmath105 ( about @xmath106  @xmath103/s ) are slightly larger than @xmath80 , the evidence of the hole scs is marginal .",
    "however , this is expected , since according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff - ele - spin ] ) @xmath105 should be close to the hole cdc @xmath67 , which is almost the same as @xmath80 , with or without the scs .",
    "a strong but somehow surprising evidence for the hole scs comes from the results with high initial spin polarization . for @xmath107% ,",
    "the hole sdc @xmath105 is @xmath108  @xmath103/s , which is close to the hole cdc @xmath67 , when @xmath99  kv / cm .",
    "as understood from the previous section , this numerical result leads to the conclusion that the spin and charge motions are not separatable for nearly fully polarized holes when @xmath99  kv / cm .",
    "however , once @xmath86 drops to @xmath100  kv / cm , @xmath105 drastically increases to @xmath109  @xmath103/s , much larger than @xmath67 . the huge difference between @xmath105 and @xmath67 when",
    "@xmath110  kv / cm is a strong indication of hole scs .",
    "however , it is also a surprising result , since one does not expect to see that @xmath105 can exceed @xmath67 by one order of magnitude even in the case of the scs from eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff - ele - spin ] ) .    the markedly enhancement of @xmath105 when @xmath110  kv / cm is understood as a result of the joint effect of scs and the coulomb drag between electron and hole spin currents . in our system , the hole spin motion is bound to the carrier motion for the holes when they are excited since the holes are almost fully polarized . when @xmath99",
    "kv / cm , the hole spin lifetime is very long ( about 1.7  ns ) , therefore the hole spin and charge are bound together in the time regime we study ( up to a few hundred pico - seconds ) , as there is not effective compensative motion from holes with the opposite spin .",
    "however , for @xmath110  kv / cm the hole spin lifetime reduces to 30  ps , therefore the hole spin and charge motions can be separated for time longer than 30  ps . moreover , due to the coulomb scattering between electron and hole spins , the fast moving electron spins can drag the hole spins to move together with them in the case of hole scs and result in the enhancement of the hole sdc . to verify that the coulomb drag is the reason of the markedly enhancement of @xmath105",
    ", we perform the numerical calculations without the electron - hole coulomb scattering and find that indeed there is not big difference between @xmath105 and @xmath67 for any @xmath86 .",
    "it should be further noted that , the spin coulomb drag between electron and hole is stronger for higher spin polarization .",
    "this is the reason that @xmath105 is only slightly larger than @xmath67 in the case of low spin polarization , while it can be one order of magnitude larger than @xmath67 in the case of large spin polarization .",
    "one can further conclude that , the markedly enhancement of @xmath105 can only be seen for the highly spin polarized spcdws in the @xmath0 gaas qws where both electrons and holes have proper spin lifetimes for the spin polarization to relax fast enough to allow the scs but not too fast to reduce the strong coulomb drag .    to observe this enhanced @xmath105",
    "experimentally , we propose to use the transmission - grating - photomasked transient spin grating technique to generate a spin polarized carrier grating with circularly polarized laser beam in the @xmath0 gaas qws,@xcite and monitor the evolution of the total electron and hole spin momentum using the circular dichromatic time - resolved pump - probe absorption spectroscopy.@xcite without the enhanced @xmath105 one is expected to observe fast changes in the total spin momentum as the electron spins quickly diffuse away , followed by a slow decay from the hole spins left behind . in the case of the markedly enhanced @xmath105 , one should not be able to observe any slow decay since the hole spins diffuse almost as fast as the electron ones .",
    "in conclusion , we study the possibility and the consequence of the scs when spatial inhomogeneities of charge and spin overlap in @xmath85-type @xmath0 gaas qws microscopically .",
    "we analytically show that , even though the motions of electron and hole cdws are bound together due to the requirement of the charge neutrality , their spin motions can be quite different from the charge motions . only in the intrinsic system with fully polarized spcdw",
    ", the spin and charge motions of both electrons and holes are bound together and their diffusions are all characterized by the adc .",
    "when carriers are not fully spin polarized , the change in the charge density caused by the spin - up carriers can be compensated by the opposite motion of the spin - down carriers . as a result , the spin and charge motions can be separated and the sdc can be quite different from the ambipolar one .",
    "the full numerical calculations confirm our analytical results that in the @xmath85-type qws the charge motions of the electrons and holes are indeed bound together , but the electron spin and charge diffusions are independent on each other due to the existence of large unpolarized background electrons .",
    "however , the spin and charge motions of holes can only be separated when the initial spin polarization is small or the spin lifetime is short .",
    "more importantly , when the spin and charge motions of holes can be separated , the coulomb drag between the spin polarized electrons and holes can have dramatic effect on the spin diffusion . with proper initial spin polarization and electron / hole spin lifetimes , which can only be achieved in @xmath0 qws",
