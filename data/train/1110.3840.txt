    "geometries in general relativity can possess various pathological features , and it is of interest how string theory , as a quantum mechanical theory of gravity , might or might not remove these pathologies .",
    "curvature singularities are the most well - known problematic features , but another interesting class is closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) , which apparently enable time travel and render the usual notions of causal time evolution untenable . hawking conjectured that no geometry initially free of closed timelike curves would develop them , the so - called chronology protection conjecture @xcite ; but whether a quantum theory of gravity might remove closed timelike curves that are already classically present is another question .    in a separate development ,",
    "there has been considerable interest in using the ads / cft correspondence to build models of condensed matter physics ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "the schrdinger spacetime , formulated in @xcite and embedded in string theory in @xcite , is of interest due to its isometry group matching the non - relativistic conformal symmetry @xcite of certain ultracold gases at unitarity , although a number of issues with the application of the geometry remain ( for a recent discussion of some aspects , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the schrdinger spacetime may be generated from the poincar patch of anti - de sitter space ( ads ) through the so - called ",
    "null melvin twist \" @xcite , generalized to a wide class of cases in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "nonzero temperature is implemented through acting the twist on a geometry containing a black hole .",
    "the appearance of rotation in such spacetimes is interesting and potentially relevant towards a description of rotating ultracold gases ; for a relativistic example , see @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting from the point of view of gravity to understand what results from acting the null melvin twist on a broader class of spacetime metrics .",
    "a natural step is then to apply the null melvin map to a rotating black hole .",
    "these black holes , however , live in global anti - de sitter space , and the only spacelike isometries available to perform the melvin map are rotational isometries , distinct from the translational symmetries used to generate the original schrdinger spacetimes and its descendants .    to understand the kind of spacetime that results , we study here the simplest case containing the essential features : the geometry resulting from acting the null melvin twist on global anti - de sitter space using a rotational isometry . since global ads",
    "holographically realizes the same field theory as the poincar patch of ads , but living on a sphere instead of flat space , it is natural to hypothesize that the geometry that results in this case will realize the same non - relativistic field theory as the original schrdinger spacetime , but living on a sphere .",
    "we find the resulting geometry is a homogeneous spacetime with a large isometry group , very similar to the symmetry group for the schrdinger spacetime , with the differences in the algebraic structure suitable for the space to indeed be dual to the non - relativistic system living on a sphere .",
    "moreover , the original schrdinger spacetime can be recovered through a coordinate limit of blowing up the size of the sphere on the novel geometry .",
    "however , there is a surprising feature of this new geometry : closed timelike curves exist .",
    "these ctcs pass through every point in the spacetime , but have a minimal radius .",
    "this aspect is strongly reminiscent of gdel spacetimes , both the original geometry @xcite and its supersymmetric descendants ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "consequently the spacetime we generate shares properties of both schrdinger and gdel systems , and we refer to it as the gdel - schrdinger spacetime .",
    "one is thus led to ask : is this gdel - schrdinger spacetime pathological due to the closed timelike curves , or does string theory mitigate them in some way ?",
    "we consider two distinct but complementary arguments suggesting that string theory does indeed avoid the difficulties of the closed timelike curves .",
    "first , one may consider a holographic screen in the spirit of the covariant holographic conjecture @xcite .",
    "for ordinary global ads space , this screen lives at the boundary , and hence it is natural to identify the boundary with the  location \" of the dual field theory degrees of freedom ; the entire spacetime is then holographically described by these modes . in the gdel - schrdinger case , however , the screen sits at a finite radius , interior to the smallest closed timelike curves ; a similar situation holds for the original gdel geometry and some of its supersymmetric descendants @xcite .",
    "thus the degrees of freedom can be taken to live at the screen , and only the interior ( ctc - free ) part of the geometry is associated to the holographic dual description .",
    "moreover , it is possible to place a brane probe inside the chronologically challenged region ; since a brane is a nonlocal object , it can sample an entire closed timelike curve and hence should be aware of the pathology .",
    "it was described by dyson @xcite how for certain black hole spacetimes with closed timelike curves , probe branes may develop a repulson - type instability @xcite which one would expect to be resolved by the branes condensation , analogous to the enhanon mechanism @xcite .",
    "a similar test was performed in the case of a supersymmetric gdel spacetime @xcite , where it was found that a bps supertube probe develops a negative kinetic term in the ctc region , implying an analogous instability . in close analogy",
    ", we find that a d3-brane  dual giant graviton \" probe develops negative kinetic terms precisely in the acausal region , and thus would be expected to condense .",
    "we thus hypothesize that while the geometry we obtain is a solution to type iib supergravity , it is not a true solution to type iib string theory . incorporating the condensed brane backreaction ,",
    "a new solution sourced by the condensed branes should exist at large radius , while the small - radius geometry would persist ; according to the holographic screen argument , only this region would be necessary to describe the dynamics experienced by a given observer .",
    "( for further work on chronology protection in string theory , see @xcite-@xcite . ) the null melvin map acting on rotating black holes would then produce holographic duals of rotating non - relativistic conformal field theories , whose analogous ctcs are presumably removed by a similar mechanism .    in section  [ melvinsec ] , we review the null melvin twist and the original schrdinger spacetime . in section  [ globalsec ]",
    "we apply the null melvin twist to global anti - de sitter space to generate the gdel - schrdinger spacetime , calculate the isometries and their algebra , and obtain ordinary schrdinger as a limit .",
    "we demonstrate the existence of closed timelike curves larger than a certain critical radius in section  [ screensec ] , compare the geometry to the gdel and supersymmetric gdel spacetimes , and demonstrate that like those geometries , an observer at the origin of gdel - schrdinger is associated to a holographic screen living inside the critical radius for ctcs .",
    "finally , in section  [ branesec ] we identify d3-brane giant graviton solutions in the gdel - schrdinger geometry and show that they develop negative kinetic terms precisely at the critical radius , suggesting an instability towards condensation of branes . in section  [ conclusionsec ] we conclude .",
    "the null melvin twist is an operation involving compositions of coordinate shifts and two t - dualities , which maps solutions to solutions in type iib supergravity @xcite .",
    "it was used by @xcite to generate the schrdinger spacetime from ordinary anti - de sitter space in the poincar patch , with an added black hole leading to the finite - temperature generalization .",
    "the melvin map was generalized to include its action on charged black holes and other , broader classes of spacetimes in @xcite ; our discussion follows @xcite .",
    "( for further developments generalizing schrdinger spacetimes , see for example @xcite . )",
    "the null melvin twist requires as input a ten - dimensional metric with timelike isometry @xmath3 and two spacelike isometries @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the solutions we are interested in have a product form with a more general compact sasaki - einstein space , but since our focus will be on phenomena in @xmath6 , we will not do so . ]",

    "the initial solution also has nonzero @xmath15 , @xmath16 with other rr fields and the nsns potential @xmath17 vanishing , and the dilaton constant @xmath18 .",
    "one may always write the five - dimensional metric as @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 running over the remaining three coordinates , and @xmath22 ; note the cross terms between the @xmath8 or @xmath9 and the other three coordinates are absorbed into @xmath23 , while a cross term between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is written as an explicit @xmath24 component .",
    "the null melvin twist then produces a new string frame type iib supergravity solution , characterized by a parameter @xmath25 , given by the nsns sector @xmath26 with the rr sector unchanged , where @xmath27 is a scalar function and @xmath28 is a 1-form on @xmath6 : @xmath29 and the new five - dimensional metric is @xmath30 with @xmath31 . in the limit @xmath32 , the original spacetime is recovered .",

    "the mode @xmath37 has no kinetic term in this string frame , but regains one in einstein frame , with @xmath38 : @xmath39      we next review the five - dimensional schrdinger solution and its symmetry group .",

    "defining @xmath42 we may apply the null melvin twist , resulting in the expressions @xmath43 and the massive vector @xmath44 since @xmath45 , the dilaton remains constant at @xmath46 , so we need not distinguish string and einstein frame metrics .",
    "it is standard to reexpress this solution in terms of light cone coordinates , @xmath47 in terms of which we obtain the metric @xmath48 with @xmath49 , and the 1-form @xmath50 this is the schrdinger solution , so called because its isometries coincide with the non - relativistic schrdinger conformal symmetry group with dynamical exponent @xmath51 , in @xmath52 spatial dimensions .",
    "the utility of non - relativistic conformal field theories ( nrcfts ) to ultracold gases at unitarity was described in @xcite , and the dual geometry ( [ pschro ] ) was first described in @xcite , and lifted to a solution of type iib string theory in @xcite .",

    "anti - de sitter space can be presented in a number of coordinate systems , some of which span the whole manifold and some of which do not .",

    "the poincar patch metric ( [ pads ] ) makes manifest the foliation of the space with respect to @xmath88 spanned by @xmath8 and the @xmath89 , and the corresponding @xmath90 lorentz subgroup and the @xmath70 translations are clearly visible .",
    "the boundary of the poincar patch is a copy of @xmath88 , and so the dual field theory lives on this space .",

    ". we will not be careful distinguishing the @xmath58 symmetry of compact time from the @xmath92 of the universal cover . ]",
    "the space is a foliation by @xmath93 ( the universal cover of @xmath94 ) , on which the boundary theory lives ; thus @xmath72 and @xmath3 are the geometrical symmetries of the dual field theory , and the remaining generators of @xmath87 are the conformal enhancement .    the ads / cft interpretation is that the poincar and global ads cases are dual to the same cft , only living on different spaces , @xmath88 vs. @xmath93 .",
    "note that it is rather nontrivial that the geometric symmetries of the two cases ( which are quite distinct for a non - conformal theory ) are enhanced to the identical symmetry group @xmath87 by the additional conformal generators .",
    "the natural question then arises : can one find something similar for the schrdinger case , a kind of  global schrdinger \" spacetime , which describes the same dual field theory but living on a sphere instead of a plane ?",

    "there are several motivations for exploring this possibility .",
    "the first is finding a gravitational dual for the nrcft on a sphere , as described above .",
    "another is understanding the implementation of rotation in the background of the nrcft , for which we want to explore the action of the melvin map on rotating black holes . the most general rotating black hole in 5d ads space preserves only three isometries , @xmath3 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we may study the null melvin twist applied to a rotational isometry of ads as the simplest case of the class of spaces that include the melvinization of the rotating black holes .    even choosing to pick a rotational direction",
    ", there is a certain amount of freedom still in defining the isometry .",
    "our philosophy will be to pick the isometry so as to make the resulting geometry resemble the schrdinger solution as much as possible .",
    "we will define the rotational isometry , the @xmath9 direction , as proportional to the hopf fiber direction @xmath99 : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a constant , so that @xmath107 then we have @xmath108 and thus @xmath109\\ , , \\\\",
    "we see that to avoid @xmath27 going negative ( and the string coupling becoming imaginary ) , we need @xmath110 . to further constrain this parameter , we note that the schrdinger solution @xmath53 has a constant dilaton . this may be achieved in the present case by demanding @xmath111 giving @xmath112 to avoid the unphysical result of vanishing or negative @xmath27 . as with @xmath53 ,",
    "the resulting constant dilaton means we need not distinguish the einstein and string frame metrics . note that a more general choice of rotational isometry ( [ choosepsi ] ) involving both @xmath99 and @xmath102 also results in a varying dilaton .",

    "unlike the schrdinger case , where @xmath25 can be absorbed into a redefinition of the light - cone coordinates ( [ lightcone ] ) , here @xmath25 defines a radial scale which has physical meaning relative to the unit ads radius .",
    "it is natural to expect that this ratio will be a nontrivial parameter in a spacetime dual to a theory living on a sphere , which possesses an extra length scale corresponding to the sphere s radius .    we will call this spacetime the five - dimensional gdel - schrdinger geometry , or @xmath82 , though so far we have not justified the connection either to the schrdinger solution @xmath53 nor to gdel spacetimes . in the remaining parts of this section",
    "we will do the former , while the latter will follow in the next section .",

    "thus the transition radius to a zone with ctcs is @xmath181 the radial scale parameter we defined previously ( [ definerctc ] ) , justifying the subscript .",
    "this radius obviously moves off to infinity as we take @xmath32 .",
    "of course , the spacetime is homogeneous , so there are closed timelike curves going through every point .",
    "what the argument above demonstrates is that these ctcs have a certain minimum size in the radial coordinate ; speaking loosely , only a region of space of characteristic size @xmath119 or larger will be able to sample a complete closed timelike curve .",
    "the fact that the spacetime is homogeneous but possesses closed timelike curves is highly reminiscent of the original gdel spacetime , as well as its higher - dimensional descendants .",
    "all these geometries are naively pathological due to the closed timelike curves .",
    "however , a number of ideas for rescuing or reinterpreting the various gdel solutions have been put forward , and we can apply these to our geometry as well . in the remainder of this section , we will consider the calculation of a holographic preferred screen for an observer at the origin in gdel - schrdinger spacetime , and show that it occurs in the region free from closed timelike curves , suggesting that the holographic description of the observer s dynamics is independent of the ctcs . in the next section ,",
    "we consider how a condensation of brane giant gravitons may modify the acausal region of the solution to remove the ctcs altogether .",
    "the original gdel solution @xcite is a four - dimensional geometry solving einstein s equations in the presence of pressureless dust and a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the metric may be written @xmath182 with periodic coordinate @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "the geometry is homogeneous , and orbits of the @xmath102 coordinate become closed timelike curves for @xmath183 .",
    "although the gdel spacetime has a global time coordinate @xmath147 , it has no global time function , as the constant-@xmath147 surfaces are not everywhere spacelike .",
    "certain properties of the gdel universe , notably the homogeneity and closed timelike curves , are also present in the spacetime we are considering .",
    "an even closer cousin is the five - dimensional supersymmetric generalization of the gdel spacetime , discovered by gauntlett , gutkowski , hull , pakis and reall @xcite .",
    "this is a solution to five - dimensional minimal supergravity with metric @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the rotation parameter , along with a nontrivial massless gauge field .",
    "following @xcite , we shall refer to this spacetime as @xmath186 .",
    "it may be lifted to a solution of eleven - dimensional supergravity , and is t - dual to a type iib pp - wave spacetime .",
    "this geometry shares a number of features with our gdel - schrdinger spacetime , the most immediately obvious being the cross - term between the time coordinate @xmath8 and the hopf fiber of the @xmath97 .",
    "they are both homogeneous , and also share the existence of closed timelike curves , which are present for @xmath186 starting at a radius @xmath187 furthermore , the symmetry groups are virtually identical .",
    "both possess a nine - dimensional group of isometries consisting of @xmath131 along with four more generators transforming in the @xmath188 .",
    "the only difference is that for @xmath186 these four generators commute except for closing onto the central extension , as was the case for @xmath53 , in contrast with the @xmath189 case , where the @xmath190 generators appear on the right - hand sides as well , as shown in equation  ( [ kcomm ] ) .",
    "other differences are that @xmath186 is supported by a massless gauge field and reverts to minkowski space as the rotation parameter is set to zero , while @xmath189 features a massive gauge field and a cosmological constant , and becomes global ads in the non - rotating limit .",
    "thus in a sense , our geometry is an anti - de sitter version of the gdel spacetime .",
    "there is also the question of whether @xmath82 is indeed nonsupersymmetric , and if so , whether there exist other solutions with properties analogous to @xmath82 ( in particular , closed timelike curves and asymptotic ads space ) that possess supersymmetry as well .",
    "the covariant holographic principle of bousso @xcite states that the size of a codimension - two area @xmath191 bounds the entropy ( or degrees of freedom ) passing through a  light sheet \" generated by the contracting null rays orthogonal to @xmath191 .",
    "in general two of the four possible null congruences orthogonal to @xmath191 ( two future - going , two past - going ) will be shrinking ; in weak gravity this is the ",
    "inward \"- moving congruence in each the past and the future , but this can change in the presence of strong gravity .",
    "a light - sheet terminates when the expansion ceases being negative ; when the null - energy condition is satisfied , this can only happen at a caustic where the curves pass through each other .    for a given observer , one may take the families of null rays emanating from any point on the observer s worldline and follow them until they cease expansion ; the area @xmath191 that is the locus of zero expansion is called a  preferred screen \" , with the family of null rays forming a light sheet for the screen .",
    "the union of all the observer s preferred screens forms a hypersurface called the preferred screen - hypersurface ; generally this hypersurface is simply referred to as a preferred screen itself , and we will follow this convention . the preferred screen holographically encodes a region consisting of all the light sheets associated to the null congruences , including the observer s worldline ; the region so encoded is called the holographic domain of the screen .    for anti - de sitter space and similar spacetimes , the preferred screen for all observers is the boundary , and the holographic domain of the boundary is all of spacetime ; thus there is a universal , observer - independent holographic boundary theory describing the entire geometry .",
    "this is not necessarily the case for a general spacetime .",
    "notably , for de sitter space , each individual observer has a distinct preferred screen coinciding with that observer s cosmological horizon , whose holographic domain does not span the entire space but instead is of finite size , suggesting each observer only has access to a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "another example in an ads - type space is the karch - randall geometry of an ads@xmath192 brane inside ads@xmath193 @xcite , where part of the space is in the holographic domain of the ads@xmath192 brane , and the rest is in the domain of the remainder of the ads@xmath193 boundary @xcite .",
    "one expects that for a general geometry , holography will be observer - dependent in some way .    as discussed in @xcite , holography in gdel - type universes",
    "is an example of such observer - dependence . for the supersymmetric gdel universe",

    "the surface of zero expansion , that is the preferred screen for the @xmath194 observer , was found to be at @xmath196 by homogeneity , this analysis holds for any point in the space .",
    "thus no single observer s preferred screen contains a complete closed timelike curve within its holographic domain , suggesting that the dynamics experienced by this observer may be consistently described by a theory living on the screen that is ignorant of the existence of the ctcs ; for further discussion , see @xcite .",
    "we will now demonstrate that a completely analogous story obtains for the gdel - schrdinger spacetime .",
    "consider an observer at @xmath194 ; again , homogeneity will imply the same obtains for any other point .",
    "the simplest way to find the screen is to note that given the large symmetry group of the @xmath82 spacetime , in particular the preserved @xmath190 acting on the squashed three - sphere , we may infer that the preferred screen will be an @xmath144 constant hypersurface .",

    "we note that the relationship between the screen location and the ctc radius is numerically identical to that for the susy gdel spacetime ( [ gscreen ] ) , further demonstrating the similarity between these two geometries .",
    "one expects that a similar argument would work for more general spaces with closed timelike curves , and sufficient symmetry . whenever the area of the would - be screen contains the direction that develops the closed timelike curve",
    ", the onset of ctcs will send the area to zero .",
    "given the area is also zero at the origin of the radial coordinate and growing as one moves away , there must be a maximal area somewhere before the ctc radius , which is the location of the screen .    to check that this is the correct result for the location of the preferred screen , and to better understand the geometry",
    ", we may explicitly find the null congruences heading away from the @xmath194 observer and calculate where their expansion vanishes .",
    "consider null geodesics passing through the origin ; let a given geodesic be parameterized by @xmath204 with @xmath205 the affine parameter .",
    "three constants of the motion are immediately obtainable from the fact that the coordinates @xmath8 , @xmath99 and @xmath102 are absent from the metric : @xmath206 in terms of which we can solve for @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 : @xmath210 the norm of the tangent vector to the geodesic is then @xmath211 this must vanish for a null geodesic ; given the first two terms , this is only possible at @xmath194 if @xmath212 .",
    "thus as one would expect for a geodesic passing through the origin , both angular momenta are zero . for a null geodesic , we may also rescale the affine parameter to impose @xmath213 .",
    "since the total @xmath129 angular momentum is zero , the rotational symmetry generators @xmath154 and @xmath155 ( [ symgens ] ) must also have zero inner product with the geodesic tangent vector . requiring this for arbitrary @xmath153 and @xmath101 forces @xmath214 .",
    "the only remaining component is then @xmath215 , and solving for it gives us @xmath216 it is already apparent a solution will only exist for @xmath217 .",
    "one can solve the resulting equations to find the solution for null geodesics passing through the origin , @xmath218 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 constant , where @xmath219 and @xmath220 are arbitrary initial values and we took @xmath221 at @xmath222 .",
    "since the spacetime is homogeneous , geodesics passing through any point behave the same way .",
    "thus as expected for a gdel universe , null geodesics spiral outward , advancing in both @xmath153 and @xmath99 as time progresses , while staying fixed on the two - sphere parameterized by @xmath101 and @xmath102 , until they reach a maximum radius of @xmath223 , after which they begin contracting again .",

    "the radius of the preferred screen is the red horizontal line . ]",
    "we may finally calculate the expansion @xmath101 of the null geodesic congruence , whose vanishing defines the preferred screen : @xmath224 which goes to zero at @xmath225 precisely the location of maximal area ; this indeed agrees with our previous result for the location of the preferred screen .",
    "it is interesting to note how gdel - schrdinger inherits properties both of anti - de sitter space as well as the gdel - type geometries . in ads , massive geodesics through the origin",
    "move out to an energy - dependent maximum radius before re - collapsing , while the lightlike geodesics make it all the way to the boundary ; in a sense ads s primary characteristic is that it traps massive particles but allows massless ones to reach infinity in finite time . in gdel spacetimes , in contrast , the null geodesics are trapped as well , and re - collapse to the origin in finite time , while rotating .",
    "this is another way of describing the observation that anti - de sitter space is holographically represented by a screen at the boundary , while gdel - type universes have a holographic screen ( for the observer at the origin ) at a finite radius .    in sum",
    ", we have demonstrated the close kinship between the gdel - schrdinger spacetime and the supersymmetric gdel universe @xmath186 ; the original gdel universe has a similar set of preferred screens @xcite , as will other , similar universes .",
    "the existence of the finite - sized preferred screen implies that any individual observer s dynamics may be calculable without having to include the ctcs , which are too large to fit inside any single holographic domain .",
    "this offers a kind of chronology protection .",
    "it may not be fully satisfactory , however , since it still leaves us with a global geometry in which the ctcs are present .",
    "one may wonder whether string theory directly addresses their existence , or only skirts it in the holographic description . in the next section",

    "it was suggested by dyson @xcite that in certain cases where the classical geometry has ctcs , the dynamics of branes may generate an enhanon - type mechanism that changes the geometry to remove the acausal behavior ; in her example , the closed timelike curves lived within a compact region , with chronologically safe geometry at infinity .",
    "a case closer to ours , where the ctcs appear outside a certain radius , was provided by drukker , fiol and simn ( dfs ) @xcite , involving a condensation of supertubes in a four - dimensional gdel - type geometry .",

    "the repulson should be removed by the condensation of branes with negative kinetic terms , in this case the supertubes , and replaced by a new  enhanon \" geometry @xcite .",
    "dfs suggested that the spacetime sourced by a collection of supertubes was the proper new geometry outside the ctc radius , and thus that after the condensation of branes the final geometry would be @xmath229 for @xmath249 , and the supertube - backreacted geometry for @xmath250 .",
    "the resulting spacetime is free of closed timelike curves .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether an analogous  repulson \" instability exists in the gdel - schrdinger spacetime .",

    "this is further evidence that string theory engages in a kind of chronology protection , as described by dyson @xcite , removing closed timelike curves by means of an enhanon - type mechanism .",

    "evidence was given that the condensation of supertubes results in a domain wall solution , with @xmath229 inside the wall , and the geometry sourced by the supertube backreaction outside @xcite .",
    "it is possible that a similar result occurs here , although we note a distinction between the cases : the supertube is a source for all the relevant spacetime @xmath227-form gauge fields due to the electric and magnetic fields turned on , while our giant graviton has no worldvolume fields , and thus does not seem to be a source for a @xmath17 field as found in the @xmath82 background .",
    "a related question involves the action of the null melvin twist , which is made out of coordinate shifts and t - dualities .",
    "one would expect both of these operations to map proper solutions to proper solutions , and indeed , as a supergravity solution the gdel - schrdinger spacetime is consistent .",
    "it contains no strong curvatures or singularities and may exist at arbitrarily weak coupling , and thus does not appear to immediately suggest string theory corrections need to be added . indeed ,",

    "understanding better how the pathological properties of the gdel - schrdinger solution arise from the action of t - dualities on anti - de sitter space would shed light on the nature of how string theory relates to and resolves non - local pathologies , and to the nonperturbative nature of string theory in general .",
    "it is also interesting to ask how the brane condensation relates to the homogeneity of the gdel - schrdinger spacetime .",
    "since every point is equivalent , observers through every point perceive their own preferred screen beyond which closed timelike curves manifest .",
    "the condensation of branes leading to a new enhanon geometry appears to break this homogeneity .",
    "does the brane condensation indicate an actual spontaneous symmetry breaking , with a single observer becoming preferred , or does each observer continue to perceive their own slice of @xmath82 , each of which being in some sense gauge equivalent to the others , in a manner analogous to horizon complementarity ?",
    "more understanding of these questions would be very useful in understanding how string theory implements holography and removes pathological features ; for related thoughts , see @xcite .",
    "the question of the relationship between supersymmetry and the gdel - schrdinger space - time is also of interest .",
    "the schrdinger geometry @xmath53 is nonsupersymmetric , but several of the gdel geometries we have described possess supersymmetry , as do generalizations of the schrdinger spacetime @xcite .",
    "the ability to reach @xmath53 as a coordinate limit of gdel - schrdinger suggests the latter is nonsupersymmetric , but this should be verified explicitly . if it is indeed nonsupersymmetric , one is naturally led to wonder whether the gdel - schrdinger geometry , like the original gdel spacetime , admits generalizations ( possessing closed timelike curves and anti - de sitter asymptotics , for example ) that are supersymmetric .",
    "certain gdel universes are known to be t - dual to pp - wave geometries @xcite .",
    "a natural additional question is then whether the gdel - schrdinger geometry has a dual description as a pp - wave or any other spacetime .",
    "a class of pp - wave spacetimes can be obtained as limits of anti - de sitter space and its cousins ; since the null melvin twist generates gdel - schrdinger from ads using coordinate limits and t - dualities , such a relationship would not be surprising .    finally , it is interesting to speculate on the application of the closed timelike curves to schrdinger holography .",
    "the null melvin twist acting on rotating black holes in ads will generate gdel - like spacetimes dual to spinning nrcfts that possess ctcs , and string theory presumably resolves them in a fashion analogous to that described here .",
    "one is led to wonder what , if any , meaning the closed timelike curves and their nonperturbative removal have in the non - gravitational dual .",
    "these issues are of considerable interest for further exploration .",
