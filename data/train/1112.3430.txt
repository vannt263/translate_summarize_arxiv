    "the interplay of heat and charge transport is the basis of thermoelectrics , enabling the conversion of heat flow to electrical power , and vice - versa .",
    "spintronics concerns the interplay of spin and charge transport and has transformed magnetic data storage technology and magnetic field sensing .",
    "the connection between these two important fields has been established in studies of thermoelectric properties of magnetic nanostructures @xcite .",
    "this interplay between heat and spin transport , now referred to as spin - caloritronics @xcite , has recently gained impetus because the combination of thermoelectrics and spintronics offers unique possibilities . on the one hand , it provides a new , spin - based approach to thermoelectric power generation and cooling . on the other hand",
    ", it provides a thermal route to create and control the flow of spin in novel spintronic devices that make functional use of heat and temperature gradients .",
    "in addition , most spintronic nanodevices involve the application of electrical currents , which create thermal gradients that might influence magnetic and spin - related phenomena and thereby device performance and efficiency .",
    "this underpins the importance of understanding the fundamental interactions between thermal and spin effects . +",
    "a notable recent development is the observation of the spin seebeck effect by uchida et al .",
    "@xcite . they found that when a ferromagnetic material ( permalloy ) is subjected to a thermal gradient @xmath5 , a spin current is injected into a non - magnetic metal ( pt ) strip attached to the ferromagnet .",
    "this spin current is converted into a voltage proportional to @xmath5 via the inverse spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "the name `` spin seebeck effect '' suggests it is the spin analogue of the classical charge seebeck effect .",
    "the latter can be understood in the following way , noting that the electrical conductance depends on the energy of the charge carriers .",
    "a thermal gradient across a ( non - magnetic ) conductor causes a flow of electrons with energy above the fermi energy from the hot to the cold side .",
    "simultaneously , electrons with energy below the fermi energy flow in the opposite direction .",
    "there is a net current because the two current components do not cancel when the conductivity for electrons above and below the fermi energy is different . in open circuit conditions",
    "this results in a voltage between the hot and cold end of the conductor , proportional to @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the seebeck coefficient . in a ferromagnetic conductor one",
    "expects that the seebeck coefficient is different for electrons with majority and minority spin , as their electronic properties are different . a thermal gradient across a ferromagnet",
    "would then yield a net flow of spin parallel to the thermal gradient , and produce in a spin voltage ( accumulation of spin ) at the hot and the cold ends of the ferromagnet .",
    "although this was originally suggested to be the cause of the observed spin seebeck effect @xcite , the currently accepted interpretation is rather different .",
    "it is now considered to originate from a non - equilibrium between the magnon distribution in the ferromagnet and the electrons in the attached non - magnetic metal , resulting in thermally driven dynamical spin pumping across the interface , without a global spin current or spin accumulation in the ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "this microscopic mechanism bears no relation with the classical charge seebeck effect . yet",
    ", the spin seebeck effect is a novel method to convert a thermal gradient into a voltage , via the spin , and the phenomenon is generic , i.e. , subsequent to the original demonstration for permalloy @xcite , it was also observed in ferromagnetic insulators @xcite , ferromagnetic semiconductors @xcite and other ferromagnetic metals @xcite . + in a different type of experiment , slachter et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated for the first time that the seebeck coefficient of a ferromagnet depends on spin .",
    "they showed that a thermal gradient in ferromagnetic permalloy induces a spin current in the permalloy parallel to the heat flow , and that when the heat flow is directed towards an interface with a non - magnetic metal , the spin current crosses the interface and produces a spin accumulation in the non - magnetic metal .",
    "this thermally - driven spin injection is directly proportional to the difference of the seebeck coefficient of majority and minority spin electrons _ in _ the ferromagnet , which was shown to be a fraction of the regular charge seebeck coefficient of the ferromagnet @xcite . + a distinctly different phenomenon , seebeck spin tunneling ,",
    "was observed by le breton et al .",
    "unlike previous work , seebeck spin tunneling is a pure interface effect that occurs in tunnel junctions with a temperature difference @xmath1 between the two electrodes , provided that at least one of the electrodes is ferromagnetic .",
    "it was demonstrated that seebeck spin tunneling creates a flow of spin angular momentum across a tunnel barrier _ without _ a charge tunnel current .",
    "this thermal spin current was shown to be governed by the variation of the spin polarization of the tunneling process with the energy of the tunneling electrons .",
    "as will be explained here , seebeck spin tunneling is directly linked to the spin - dependent seebeck coefficient of a magnetic tunnel contact .",
    "this implies that the results of le breton et al . effectively demonstrated that the seebeck tunnel coefficient for majority and minority spin is different .",
    "in addition , le breton et al . _ used _ seebeck spin tunneling for thermally - driven spin injection into a semiconductor , i.e. , they observed that in ferromagnet / insulator / silicon tunnel contacts , the thermal spin current induces a spin accumulation @xmath0 in the silicon .",
    "+ an interesting analogy exists between electrical and thermal spin transport across a tunnel junction .",
    "seebeck spin tunneling is the thermoelectric analogue of spin - polarized tunneling , which refers to the spin dependence of the electrical conductance of a magnetic tunnel contact .",
    "the latter was clearly demonstrated four decades ago in experiments @xcite on ferromagnet / insulator / superconductor junctions , showing that the charge tunnel current between a ferromagnet and a non - magnetic counter electrode is spin polarized . in magnetic tunnel junctions comprising _ two _ ferromagnetic electrodes , spin - polarized tunneling also gives rise to large tunnel magnetoresistance @xcite , denoting the change of the tunnel resistance as a function of the relative orientation ( parallel vs. antiparallel ) of the magnetization of the electrodes .",
    "analogously , seebeck spin tunneling produces a tunnel magnetothermopower , i.e. , a dependence of the thermopower of a magnetic tunnel junction on the relative magnetization alignment of the two electrodes .",
    "this tunnel magnetothermopower ( or tunnel magneto - seebeck effect ) has been theoretically predicted @xcite and recently observed by different groups , first in mgo - based tunnel junctions @xcite , and subsequently in al@xmath8o@xmath9 junctions @xcite .",
    "anisotropy of the tunnel magnetothermopower was also reported @xcite .",
    "last but not least , it was predicted that thermal gradients give rise to thermal spin - transfer torques in magnetic heterostructures @xcite and tunnel junctions @xcite and experimental evidence for thermal torques has been presented @xcite . + le breton et al .",
    "@xcite described the salient features of seebeck spin tunneling by numerical evaluation of a free electron model . here",
    "we present a phenomenological framework to describe seebeck spin tunneling in linear response in terms of parameters that can be obtained from experiment and analytical or _ ab - initio _ theory .",
    "key ingredients are a tunnel conductance with a spin polarization that depends on energy , and the spin polarization of the thermally - induced electrical transport across the tunnel barrier .",
    "an important aim is to establish the connection with a seebeck tunnel coefficient that depends on spin .",
    "we evaluate the thermal spin current , the induced spin accumulation and @xmath4 , and show that these are proportional to @xmath10 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the seebeck tunnel coefficient for majority and minority spin , respectively .",
    "we discuss limiting regimes , and point out that the thermally - induced spin accumulation increases for smaller tunnel resistance , in contrast to the electrically - induced spin accumulation that suffers from the impedance mismatch between a ferromagnetic metal and a semiconductor @xcite .",
    "we also compare the fundamental limits of thermal and electrical spin tunneling .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that the thermally - induced spin accumulation produces an additional thermovoltage proportional to @xmath0 that can significantly enhance the conventional charge thermopower .",
    "the thermopower can be manipulated with a magnetic field owing to the hanle effect , producing a hanle magnetothermopower in junctions with only one ferromagnetic electrode .",
    "we consider a tunnel junction with a ferromagnetic electrode and a non - ferromagnetic electrode , typically a semiconductor ( fig .",
    "1 ) or metal . it is assumed that the tunnel resistance @xmath11 is much larger than the resistance of the electrodes , such that tunneling limits the transport .",
    "the ferromagnetic and non - magnetic electrode are characterized by so - called spin resistances @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , describing the ratio of the spin accumulation in the material and the associated spin current due to spin relaxation @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath11 relative to @xmath12 and @xmath13 plays an important role in the spin transport , as it determines the coupling between the two spin systems .",
    "we will assume that @xmath14 , which is usually the case when an interface with a ( schottky or oxide ) tunnel barrier is formed ( the resistance - times - area product is 1 - 10 @xmath15 or larger for magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite , while @xmath12 is typically below 0.01 @xmath16 for transition metal ferromagnets @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , one does not need to consider the spin accumulation and spin - dependent ( electrical or thermal ) transport _ within _ the ferromagnet , including the spin - dependent seebeck effect @xcite due to any temperature gradients within the ferromagnet .",
    "the spin resistance of the non - magnetic material is normally much larger than @xmath12 .",
    "we do not make any specific assumptions about the value of @xmath11 relative to @xmath13 .",
    "we thus cover the regime with @xmath17 where the spin accumulation in the semiconductor is effectively decoupled from the ferromagnet by the tunnel barrier , as well as the regime with @xmath18 where the coupling to the ferromagnet reduces the spin accumulation in the non - magnetic material @xcite .    , whereas the ferromagnet is at @xmath19 .",
    "a spin accumulation exists in the semiconductor , described by a spin splitting @xmath20 of the electrochemical potential .",

    "it incorporates the effect of the shifts of the electrochemical potentials @xmath27 in the semiconductor due to the presence of the spin accumulation @xmath20 ( for convenience we have defined @xmath0 in units of volt ) .",

    "the second term on the right - hand side describes the thermally - induced tunnel current in response to a temperature difference , as governed by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which we will refer to as the thermoelectric tunnel conductances ( not to be confused with the thermal conductance that describes heat flow ) .",
    "we define @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath19 are the temperatures of the non - magnetic and ferromagnetic electrode , respectively , and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the spin - averaged potentials of the non - magnetic and ferromagnetic electrode .",
    "+ the total conductances are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and their spin polarizations are @xmath37 and @xmath38 . the charge tunnel current @xmath39 and the spin tunnel current @xmath40 are then : @xmath41 the spin current consists of an electrical ( @xmath42 ) and a thermal contribution ( @xmath43 ) , as well as a correction due to the @xmath0 that is induced by the ( electrical and/or thermal ) spin current .",
    "the feedback of @xmath0 on the spin / charge tunnel current implies that another ( independent ) relation between @xmath0 and @xmath40 is required to obtain a solution .",
    "this is provided by the requirement of a steady - state spin accumulation in the non - magnetic material , which implies that the spin current @xmath40 injected by tunneling is balanced by the spin current due to spin relaxation in the material , integrated over its full spatial extent .",
    "the spin current associated with spin relaxation is proportional to the spin accumulation .",
    "we define a spin resistance @xmath44 of the non - magnetic material via : @xmath45 in our model , @xmath44 is a phenomenological parameter that describes the conversion of the spin current @xmath40 that is injected by tunneling , into a spin accumulation @xmath0 . as mentioned before",
    ", @xmath0 denotes the value of the spin accumulation right at the tunnel interface .",
    "this definition of @xmath44 makes no specific assumptions about the spatial profile of the spin accumulation in the non - magnetic material , or the formalism used to compute it .",
    "if we use the spin - diffusion equation and a spin accumulation that decays exponentially with distance from the injection interface with the spin - diffusion length @xmath46 , then the spin resistance of a unit contact area can be expressed as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the resistivity of the non - magnetic material @xcite .",
    "this result is frequently used to analyze experimental data , but note that it requires introduction of a somewhat unusual factor of two in eqn .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq3]-[eq5 ] ) fully define the system and allow us to obtain the relevant quantities .",
    "we first derive a general expression for the spin accumulation , valid for electrical ( @xmath49 ) and thermal ( @xmath50 ) injection , as well as for a combination of the two .",
    "we shall discuss the case of purely thermal ( @xmath51 ) and purely electrical ( @xmath52 ) driving force later on .",
    "the solutions for @xmath0 and the spin current in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath39 are : @xmath53 \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] @xmath54 \\label{eq9}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the tunnel resistance and @xmath56 is the charge thermopower ( in the absence of a spin accumulation ; see below ) .",
    "the first term in eqn . ( [ eq9 ] ) , proportional to @xmath39 , is the electrical spin current associated with the spin - polarized charge current .",
    "the second term is the pure spin current due to seebeck spin tunneling ( driven by @xmath1 ) and will be referred to as the seebeck spin current .",
    "the seebeck spin tunneling coefficient @xmath57 is obtained by setting @xmath51 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , and rewriting @xmath58 in terms of spin - dependent seebeck tunnel coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 for majority and minority spin , respectively .",
    "we then obtain an important result , namely , @xmath61 is proportional to @xmath62 : @xmath63 since @xmath64 , the pre - factor always has a positive sign .",
    "the sign of @xmath65 is thus determined by the difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "note that the pre - factor tends to zero when the tunnel spin polarization becomes very large ( @xmath68 or @xmath69 ) , but @xmath65 does not because also @xmath70 for one of the two spin channels goes to zero .",

    "this includes recent experiments on seebeck spin tunneling @xcite ( where @xmath51 ) , as well as most experiments on electrical spin injection that are performed in constant current mode ( and @xmath52 ) .",
    "alternatively , we can express @xmath0 and @xmath40 in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath21 .",

    "+      the charge thermopower s is obtained from the voltage @xmath78 for which @xmath39 vanishes . from eqn .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) we obtain : @xmath79 this is another important result . in the presence of a spin accumulation ,",
    "the charge thermopower is not equal to @xmath56 .",
    "there is an additional , previously unidentified , contribution that is proportional to @xmath0 and thus to the seebeck spin tunnel coefficient @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath80 can be positive or negative depending on the properties of the ferromagnet / insulator interface , and also @xmath65 can have either sign , the additional contribution can enhance or reduce the charge thermopower .",
    "the enhancement can be significant because @xmath65 can be much larger than @xmath81 , as we will see in the discussion section .",
    "+ next we address how the thermally - induced spin accumulation can be detected as a voltage signal .",
    "just as for electrically - induced spin accumulation , this can be done via the hanle effect , which occurs when the spins in the semiconductor are subjected to a magnetic field @xmath82 at a solid angle @xmath83 with the spin direction @xcite .",
    "this causes spin precession and consequently a reduction of @xmath0 depending on @xmath83 and on the product of the spin lifetime @xmath84 and the larmor frequency @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the land g - factor , @xmath87 the bohr magneton and @xmath88 planck s constant divided by 2@xmath89 .",
    "when the tunnel resistance is sufficiently large ( @xmath90 ) such that the coupling of the spin accumulation to the ferromagnet can be neglected , spin precession causes a decay of @xmath0 in a lorentzian fashion @xcite : @xmath91 in the absence of any magnetic field there is no spin precession and the spin resistance is @xmath92 .",
    "if we keep @xmath1 and the charge current @xmath39 constant , apply a magnetic field perpendicular to the spins , and increase @xmath82 from zero to a value for which @xmath93 , the spin resistance is gradually reduced from @xmath92 to zero .",
    "the @xmath0 then also goes to zero , even if the spin current @xmath40 that is injected by tunneling is non - zero .",
    "this results in the desired voltage change , which is obtained from eqn .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) as : @xmath94 an important point is that this expression is valid irrespective of how the spin accumulation is created . in other words , also for a thermally - induced spin accumulation , the detected voltage signal @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 times @xmath97 , which is the same relation as for electrically - induced spin accumulation @xcite .",
    "+ in the regime where @xmath98 , the magnitude of @xmath0 is reduced by the coupling of the spins to the ferromagnet , but also the functional dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath82 is modified and eqn .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) does not correctly describe the dependence on @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "however , the maximum and minimum values of @xmath0 for , respectively , @xmath99 and @xmath93 are still properly described .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the spin accumulation can still be correctly obtained from eqn .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "however , extracting the spin lifetime from the line width of the hanle curve requires a detailed description of the line shape taking the interaction with the ferromagnet into account .",
    "+ the ability to manipulate the spin accumulation with an external magnetic field ( owing to the hanle effect ) also means that @xmath65 and hence the charge thermopower @xmath7 can be controlled by a magnetic field .",
    "we define the hanle magnetothermopower @xmath100 as the relative change of the thermopower between its value in zero magnetic field , and the value at @xmath101 that corresponds to @xmath93 : @xmath102 the magnetothermopower is mediated by the spin accumulation , has a variation with magnetic field that is governed by the hanle effect , and occurs in tunnel contacts in which only one of the electrodes is ferromagnetic .",
    "it is thus different from the tunnel magnetothermopower recently observed in a magnetic tunnel junction with two ferromagnetic electrodes , which has a magnetic field variation that is controlled by the angle between the magnetizations of the two electrodes @xcite .",
    "the hanle magnetothermopower can be very large because @xmath65 can be much larger than @xmath81 .",
    "we have seen that seebeck spin tunneling occurs when the seebeck coefficient of a magnetic tunnel contact is different for majority and minority spin .",
    "le breton et al .",
    "@xcite described the salient features of seebeck spin tunneling by numerical evaluation of a free electron model , and showed that seebeck spin tunneling is determined by the energy derivative of the tunnel spin polarization . in this section",
    "we will establish the important connection between these two notions , and also clarify the definition of seebeck spin tunneling .",
    "+ first , we note that @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath103 and that the spin accumulation induced by seebeck spin tunneling is proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "this is easily understood because when @xmath51 , any thermally - induced current ( with polarization @xmath104 ) must be balanced by an equal but opposite electrically - driven current ( with polarization @xmath80 ) .",
    "if the tunnel spin polarization does _ not depend on energy _",
    ", all the induced ( electrical or thermal ) current components necessarily have the same spin polarization , and we have @xmath105 . in that case @xmath106 , the seebeck spin current vanishes for all @xmath1 , and a spin current exists only if the charge current is non - zero . to illustrate that @xmath105 if the tunnel spin polarization does not depend on energy , we express @xmath70 and @xmath107 in terms of the tunnel transmission function @xmath108 integrated over energy @xmath109 , as @xcite : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the energy derivative of the fermi - dirac distribution function @xmath112 .",
    "when @xmath113 and @xmath114 have the same variation with energy , we can write @xmath115 , where the coefficients @xmath116 and @xmath117 do not depend on energy . inserting this in eqns .",
    "( [ eq11a ] ) and ( [ eq11b ] ) we find @xmath118 .",
    "then @xmath80 and @xmath104 are independent of @xmath109 and @xmath105 . since @xmath119 is proportional to @xmath120 ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath121 if the tunnel spin polarization does not depend on energy .",
    "this establishes the connection between the energy derivative of @xmath80 and a spin - dependent seebeck coefficient : @xmath122 only if the tunnel spin polarization depends on energy .",
    "+ there is ample evidence for the energy dependence of the tunnel spin polarization .",
    "indirect evidence comes from the decay of tunnel magnetoresistance with bias voltage in magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite .",
    "direct evidence is provided in two reports for transition metal ferromagnets on al@xmath8o@xmath9 , where the variation of the tunnel spin polarization with energy of the tunnel electrons was determined @xcite . a significant asymmetry in the decay of the tunnel spin polarization with energy below and above the fermi energy",
    "was reported , the decay being much faster above the fermi energy .",
    "+ let us define the term seebeck spin tunneling more precisely , because one could argue that a thermally - driven spin current can exist even if @xmath105 . while technically correct , in this case the charge current is non - zero , i.e.",
    ", it is not a pure spin current .",
    "in fact , for @xmath105 any thermally - induced spin current is from the spin - polarized charge current that arises from the shift of the @xmath123 curve by an amount equal to the charge thermovoltage @xmath124 .",
    "we do not consider this to be seebeck spin tunneling , which is associated with a non - zero energy derivative of the tunnel spin polarization ( in analogy with the conventional charge seebeck effect that is related to a non - zero energy derivative of the charge conductivity ) .",
    "experimentally , one will have a combination of a thermally - driven spin - polarized charge current and seebeck spin tunneling , unless one measures at @xmath51 , as done in ref . .",
    "+      it is instructive to compare the magnitude of the spin current due to electrical and thermal spin tunneling . besides the fundamental interest ,",
    "this is of course important from a technological point of view .",
    "one question is whether the creation of a spin current by a temperature difference across the tunnel barrier can be more energy efficient than creating a spin current electrically .",
    "another question is whether the heat that is produced by electrical generation of a spin current can be re - used to supplement it with a thermal spin current , and how much increase in spin current , or reduction in energy consumption , can be obtained in this way .",
    "the answer to those questions can not be given in general terms .",
    "the efficiency of creating the temperature difference depends crucially on the thermal design of the structures .",
    "moreover , whereas it has been known for four decades that the electrical tunnel conductance is spin polarized and the polarization has been rather well optimized , the seebeck spin tunneling has only recently been observed and the difference @xmath62 is far from optimum .",
    "we will therefore only discuss the factors that determine the ultimate limits of electrical and thermal spin current .",
    "+ we consider the driving term as well as the proportionality factor between @xmath0 and the driving term ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the thermal driving term is @xmath125 , which should be compared to the electrical driving term @xmath126 . for non - magnetic metal tunnel junctions @xmath81",
    "has been evaluated @xcite to be in the range of @xmath127v / k , although it has been predicted that it can be enhanced by magnons in ferromagnetic tunnel junctions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 for tunnel junctions will , in practice , be limited to about 10 k. hence , @xmath125 is of the order of 1 mv , which is to be compared to typical values of a few 100 mv for @xmath126 . in general , the thermal driving term will thus be smaller than the electrical driving term . + with respect to the proportionality factor , for electrical spin injection",
    "it is limited by @xmath80 , since its absolute value can not be larger than 1 ( by definition ) .",
    "however , such a restriction does not exist for the proportionality factor of the thermal spin current , since there is no limit for the energy derivatives that govern @xmath62 and @xmath128 . in principle ,",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 can be equal in magnitude but of opposite sign , so that @xmath129 and @xmath104 goes to infinity .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the situation where the tunnel spin polarizations for states above and below the fermi energy have opposite sign , such that one type of spin is driven from the hot to the cold side of the tunnel contact , and the other type of spin is driven from the cold to the hot side .",
    "hence , the proportionality factor for thermal spin accumulation can , in principle , be arbitrarily large for suitably engineered materials .",
    "this can therefore ( more than ) compensate for the smaller thermal driving term .",
    "this suggests that seebeck spin tunneling can be a viable approach to create a spin current , either by itself , or in conjunction with an electrical spin current .",

    "an important point is that the seebeck spin tunnel coefficient @xmath65 can be much larger than the regular charge thermopower @xmath81 . to illustrate this ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath65 and @xmath81 is shown as a function of relevant parameters in fig .",
    "2 . for materials with large tunnel spin polarization ( @xmath68 or @xmath69 ) ,",
    "a very large seebeck spin tunneling coefficient is produced if @xmath104 and @xmath80 are unequal , or preferably , of opposite sign .",
    "this situation would occur for ferromagnet / insulator interfaces that have an almost full spin polarization of the tunnel conductance for states at and below the fermi energy @xmath130 , but a rapidly decaying or even opposite spin polarization above @xmath130 , for instance due to the onset of a contribution to the tunneling of a band with opposite spin orientation .",
    "since the total thermopower is given by the sum of @xmath81 and @xmath131 ( eqn .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) ) , the thermally - induced spin accumulation in the non - magnetic material can significantly enhance the charge thermopower of a tunnel junction .",
    "normalized to @xmath81 , as a function of @xmath132 , for various values of @xmath133 and fixed @xmath134 , and ( inset ) for fixed @xmath135 and @xmath80 varied .",
    "note that @xmath106 if @xmath136.,width=302 ]      a noteworthy difference between electrical and thermal creation of a spin accumulation is the scaling with tunnel resistance ( fig . 3 , and appendix a for explicit expressions for the different regimes ) .",
    "for electrical spin injection , the polarization of the injected current ( @xmath137 ) is @xmath80 as long as the tunnel resistance is larger than the spin resistance of the semiconductor ( see appendix a , eqn .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) ) .",
    "however , when @xmath138 , the coupling to the ferromagnet starts to play a role , and the feedback of @xmath0 on the tunnel transport severely reduces the spin polarization of the tunnel current ( which is well established @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "@xmath139 , the spin accumulation per unit injected charge current , is constant at large @xmath11 but decays at small tunnel resistance ( fig .",
    "3 , top panel ) . + in contrast",
    ", the scaling of the thermally - induced spin accumulation is opposite : @xmath140 _ increases _ as the tunnel resistance is lowered , and reaches a large and constant value when @xmath11 becomes _ smaller _ than @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "3 , bottom panel ) .",
    "this behavior is consistent with that obtained by numerical evaluation of a free electron model @xcite .",
    "it thus appears that thermal injection is more efficient at small tunnel resistance , whereas electrical creation of spin accumulation requires sufficiently large tunnel resistance to overcome the impedance mismatch .",

    "3 we have neglected that @xmath81 decays for thinner tunnel barriers , because the decay is known to be very weak @xcite and does not critically affect the main scaling trend .",
    "it is also known that for an ultrathin tunnel contact , the thermal ( heat ) conductance @xmath141 , with @xmath142 the heat current , is limited by the interfaces rather than the bulk thermal heat conductance of the tunnel barrier material .",
    "therefore , the thermal conductance @xmath141 is expected to be approximately independent of @xmath11 .",
    "a similar trend would thus result if we would plot @xmath143 instead of @xmath61 .",
    "we thus find that the spin accumulation per unit _ charge _",
    "current is maximum for _ large _ tunnel resistance , whereas the spin accumulation per unit _ heat _ current across the tunnel barrier is maximum at _ small _ tunnel resistance .     for electrical injection ( top panel ) and @xmath61 for seebeck spin tunneling ( bottom panel ) , both as a function of the ratio @xmath132 of the tunnel resistance and the spin resistance of the semiconductor .",
    "the results are normalized to the maximum value as indicated ( @xmath144 for electrical and @xmath145 for thermal ) .",
    "the dashed lines describe the result when one neglects the feedback of @xmath0 on the spin current injected from the ferromagnet .",
    "the arrows indicate the reduction due to the feedback .",
    "the @xmath80 was set to 0.3.,width=302 ]",
    "a phenomenological framework has been presented to describe seebeck spin tunneling , the thermoelectric analog of spin - polarized tunneling .",
    "it was established that seebeck spin tunneling originates from the spin dependence of the seebeck coefficient of a tunnel junction with a ferromagnetic electrode , i.e. , @xmath146 .",
    "the connection with a tunnel spin polarization @xmath80 that depends on energy was also made .",
    "seebeck spin tunneling creates a thermal flow of spin - angular momentum across a tunnel barrier without a charge tunnel current . in ferromagnet / insulator / semiconductor tunnel junctions",
    "it allows creation of a spin accumulation @xmath0 in the semiconductor by a temperature difference @xmath1 between the electrodes .",
    "we expressed the thermal spin current , the induced spin accumulation and @xmath4 in terms of the spin - dependent seebeck coefficients , tunnel resistance and spin resistance of the non - magnetic electrode .",
    "the thermally - induced spin accumulation produces an additional thermovoltage proportional to @xmath0 , which can significantly enhance the conventional charge thermopower .",
    "because the spin accumulation can be manipulated via the hanle effect , the thermopower depends on a magnetic field , producing a hanle magnetothermopower in junctions in which only one of the electrodes is a ferromagnet .",
    "the thermally - induced spin accumulation was shown to be maximum for smaller tunnel resistance , in contrast to the electrically - induced spin accumulation that suffers from the impedance mismatch between a ferromagnetic metal and a semiconductor . while the efficiency of electrical spin injection is limited by the fact that @xmath147 , no such restriction exists for thermal spin current that is determined by the energy derivative of @xmath80 , which is unbounded .",
    "with suitably engineered materials , seebeck spin tunneling is thus a viable option for efficient creation of spin current .",
    "there are two limiting regimes for seebeck spin tunneling ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "when @xmath90 , the induced @xmath0 remains relatively small and the feedback of @xmath0 on the tunnel transport is negligible .",
    "for this regime one obtains : @xmath148 the spin accumulation decays at larger tunnel resistance since for a tunnel contact @xmath149 depends only weakly on @xmath11 .",
    "this is because all ( thermal or electrical ) tunnel current components , and hence @xmath150 and @xmath151 , decay exponentially with tunnel barrier width and height @xcite .",
    "+ when @xmath152 , we have : @xmath153 in this regime , which corresponds to tunnel contacts with sufficiently low resistance - area product , @xmath65 and @xmath0 do not directly depend on @xmath11 .",
    "+      for comparison , the spin accumulation @xmath154 induced by electrical injection of a spin - polarized charge current , without a temperature difference across the tunnel barrier , is given by : @xmath155 and the spin current is : @xmath156 we remark that it is customary @xcite to replace the real tunnel resistance @xmath11 by @xmath157 , introducing @xmath158 as an effective tunnel resistance .",
    "the pre - factor then takes a more simple form without the factor @xmath159 . as a result , it is no longer evident that in order to determine the transition into the regime where the feedback of @xmath0 on the tunneling becomes relevant , one has to compare the tunnel resistance to @xmath160 .",
    "the transition thus depends on the value of @xmath80 .",
    "we therefore choose to retain the term @xmath159 explicitly ."
