    "spacetime foam may be one of the features of the quantum theory of gravity : at microscopic length scales comparable to the planck length , spacetime is affected by quantum fluctuations of its geometry and topology  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting , then , to investigate how these fluctuations influence the propagation of particles in the emerging classical spacetime .",
    "many different models have been proposed over the years to represent the effects of spacetime foam ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . here , we are particularly interested in the approach used in ref .  @xcite .    in that work ,",
    "the possible remnants of the spacetime foam are described by a swiss - cheese - type classical spacetime manifold , where balls of space are removed from a spatial slice of minkowski spacetime .",
    "the holes of this manifold have antipodal points on their boundaries identified and we refer to the resulting structures by the name of `` spacetime defects . '' in this case , space around a defect is simply described by spherical coordinates and the topological structure of the defect is implemented by additional boundary conditions on the matter fields .",
    "but a system of spacetime coordinates that automatically describes the structure of the defect has not been supplied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a first attempt to solve this problem has been provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that it is indeed possible to introduce such a system of spacetime coordinates .",
    "however , the particular coordinates discussed in that work were used to define a manifold whose metric is not smooth at the defect surface and is not a vacuum solution of einstein s gravitational field equations .    an improved result has been obtained recently in ref .  @xcite . in that work , a different set of spacetime coordinates has been introduced , which allows us to define a defect manifold whose metric is smooth everywhere .",
    "the form of the metric has been derived as a vacuum solution of the einstein field equations .",
    "the three types of spacetime defects described in refs .",
    "@xcite have the same topological structure .",
    "the three manifolds are indeed related by homeomorphisms , but they are not diffeomorphic to each other  @xcite . here , we show that this is a physically relevant distinction and that the three manifolds really describe different types of spacetime defects with different observable characteristics . to do so , we compare the solutions of the massless klein ",
    "gordon equation for the three cases .    at this moment",
    ", a few remarks may help to place our spacetime defects in context .",
    "first , of the three spacetime defects considered in this paper only one is a solution of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "second , that particular vacuum solution ( with a mass - type parameter @xmath1 ) appears asymptotically in a finite - energy matter solution with the same topology  @xcite .",
    "this matter solution with a skyrmion field has , however , only been obtained numerically and the present paper focuses instead on the vacuum solution which is known analytically .",
    "third , the vacuum defect solution is reminiscent of the so - called @xmath2geon solution  @xcite ( further references and a brief review can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath2geon can be interpreted as a non - static defect with length scale @xmath3 ranging from @xmath4 ( at the initial and final curvature singularities ) to @xmath5 ( halfway between the initial and final singularities ) , whereas the defect vacuum solution is static and has constant length scale @xmath6 .",
    "fourth , the metric of the defect vacuum solution is non - lorentzian , i.e. , the standard elementary flatness condition does not apply everywhere  @xcite ; see below for details .",
    "the motivation of the present paper is to to better understand this non - lorentzian metric ( independent of coordinate issues ) by studying the klein ",
    "gordon equation . as such",
    ", the scope of the present paper is limited .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : framework ] , we introduce the three types of defects . in sec . [ sec : scalar_solutions ] , we discuss and compare the solutions of the klein  gordon equation for the three different cases . in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusion ] , we give a summary of the results .",
    "[ app : radial_solution_0 ] , we provide a detailed derivation of the solutions near the defect surface for the smooth manifold from ref .",
    "@xcite and compare to the case of standard minkowski spacetime .",
    "in this section , we introduce the different spacetime defects to be examined later on .",
    "the defect length scale is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "we start with the simplest case , where the defect is obtained from minkowski spacetime by surgery  @xcite and the resulting spacetime is denoted @xmath7 , which is a topological manifold with a differential structure inherited from minkowski spacetime .",
    "we , then , consider the defect described by the manifold from ref .",
    "@xcite , referred to as @xmath8 , which is a differentiable manifold but not a smooth lorentzian ( pseudo - riemannian ) manifold .",
    "finally , we introduce the manifold from ref .",
    "@xcite , denoted @xmath9 , which would be a smooth lorentzian manifold , were it not for the fact that at certain points the metric is degenerate and the standard elementary - flatness property does not hold ( details will be given in sec .",
    "[ subsec : smooth_defect ] ) .",
    "let us clarify the distinctions between these different types of manifold . with a `` topological manifold '' @xmath10",

    ".manifolds considered in this article , with defect length scale @xmath26 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the heuristic explanation for having only @xmath27 parity eigenvalues in table  [ tab : parity ] for the @xmath9 manifold is as follows .",
    "the original construction of this manifold  @xcite relies on the combination @xmath28 for the chart-1 coordinate @xmath29 ( and similarly for the charts 2 and 3 ) . in turn",
    ", the corresponding scalar solution involves the same combination @xmath28 .",
    "the explicit radial solution is then given by eq . and shows a nonvanishing value at @xmath30 , which rules out having continuous solutions that are odd in @xmath29 .    from the comparison in table  [ tab :",
    "parity ] , we conclude that the three spacetime defects , even if they are topologically equivalent , produce different modifications of the propagation of the scalar field  @xcite .",
    "these different effects become particularly important in the context of a spacetime foam , where the quantum fluctuations of spacetime may give rise to a `` gas '' of defects in the emerging classical spacetime .",
    "depending on which particular type of spacetime defect turns out to be relevant , different modified dispersion relations result .",
    "this conclusion also holds for photons , for which analogous results can be derived .",

    "kl 1103/2 - 1 .",
    "we thank the referee for useful comments and a. kern for spotting a few minor errors in the appendix .",
    "the results of sec . [ sec : scalar_solutions ] have shown that the scalar field solutions for minkowski spacetime [ eqs . and ] and those for the smooth defect metric [ eq . ]",
    "are equivalent in the separate regions @xmath32 and @xmath33 , but not at the origin @xmath31 . in this appendix , we study , for a neighborhood of the origin , the radial wave equation of the smooth defect manifold @xmath9 ( @xmath26 ) and the radial wave equation of minkowski spacetime @xmath34 , both expressed in the same coordinate system @xmath35 .",
