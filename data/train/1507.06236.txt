    "recently , after some remarkable works by different authors @xcite , showing the important role that spinor fields play on the evolution of the universe , the situation began to change .",
    "this change of attitude is directly related to some fundamental questions of modern cosmology : ( i ) problem of initial singularity ; ( ii ) problem of isotropization and ( iii ) late time acceleration of the universe .    given",
    "the role that the spinor field can play in the evolution of the universe , the question that naturally emerges is , if the spinor field can redraw the picture of evolution caused by perfect fluid and dark energy , is it possible to simulate perfect fluid and dark energy by means of a spinor field ?",
    "an affirmative answer to this question was given in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "in those papers , a spinor description of matter , such as a perfect fluid and dark energy , was given and the evolution of the universe , given by different bianchi models , was thoroughly studied . in almost all the papers the spinor field was considered to be a time - dependent function and its energy - momentum tensor was given by the diagonal elements only .",
    "some latest studies show that because of the specific connection with the gravitational field the energy - momentum tensor of the spinor field possesses non - trivial non - diagonal components as well , and these non - zero non - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor play decisive a role in the character of the geometry of space - time as well as on the components of the spinor field @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the evolution of the universe filled with spinor field within the scope of a locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) bianchi type - i ( bi ) cosmological model .",
    "it should be noted that a general bi model in the presence of a nonlinear spinor field duly evolves into a lrs bi model @xcite . in this paper",
    "we thoroughly study the role of a spinor field in the evolution of the universe given by a lrs bi model . here",
    "we also consider a more general type of nonlinearity .",
    "in this paper we plan to study the evolution of the universe given by a lrs bi anisotropic cosmological model filled with nonlinear spinor field .",
    "the lrs bi model is the ordinary bi model with two of the three metric functions being equal to each other and can be given by @xmath0 - a_3^{2}\\,dz^2 , \\label{lrsbi}\\ ] ] with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being functions of time only .",
    "the nontrivial components of the einstein tensor corresponding to metric ( [ lrsbi ] ) are    [ lrsbiet ] @xmath3    keeping in mind the symmetry between @xmath4 and @xmath5 we choose the symmetrized lagrangian @xcite for the spinor field as @xcite : @xmath6 - m_{\\rm sp } { \\bar \\psi}\\psi - f , \\label{lspin}\\ ] ] where the nonlinear term @xmath7 describes the self - interaction of a spinor field and can be presented as some arbitrary function of invariants generated from the real bilinear forms of a spinor field .",
    "we consider @xmath8 , with @xmath9 taking one of the following expressions @xmath10 .",
    "it can be shown that such a choice describes the nonlinearity in its most general form .",
    "here @xmath11 is the covariant derivative of spinor field @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the spinor affine connection . in ( [ lspin ] )",

    "the spinor affine connection matrices @xmath20 are uniquely determined up to an additive multiple of the unit matrix by @xmath21 with the solution @xmath22    the spin affine connection corresponding to lrs bi metric ( [ lrsbi ] ) can be written explicitly as @xmath23    varying ( [ lspin ] ) with respect to @xmath24 one finds the spinor field equations :    [ speq ] @xmath25    here we denote @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28    the energy - momentum tensor of the spinor field is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 in view of ( [ speq1 ] ) and ( [ speq2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath31 - m_{\\rm sp } { \\bar \\psi}\\psi - f(k ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\imath}{2 } { \\bar \\psi}[\\gamma^{\\mu } \\nabla_{\\mu } \\psi - m_{\\rm sp } \\psi ] - \\frac{\\imath}{2}[\\nabla_{\\mu } \\bar \\psi \\gamma^{\\mu } + m_{\\rm sp } { \\bar \\psi } ] \\psi - f(k),\\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 f_k ( i k_i + j k_j ) - f = 2 k f_k - f(k ) .",
    "\\label{lspin01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    further inserting ( [ covder ] ) into ( [ temsp ] ) the energy - momentum tensor of the spinor field can be written as @xmath32    finally , exploiting the explicit form of spin connection ( [ saclrsbi ] ) after some manipulations one finds the following non - trivial components of the energy - momentum tensor of the spinor field    [ emtlrsbi ] @xmath33    so the complete set of einstein equations for a bi metric should be    [ lrsbien ] @xmath34    before solving the einstein equations let us first write the equations for the bilinear spinor forms . recalling that there are 16 bilinear spinor forms , namely , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , pseudovector and antisymmetric tensor , respectively , for the lrs bi metric",
    "one finds the following system of equations :    [ invlrsbi ] @xmath37    where we denote @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we also denote @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath42    here we also introduce the volume scale @xmath43",
    "from ( [ s0lrsbi ] ) - ( [ q021lrsbi ] ) one finds the following relations :    [ inv0lrsbi ] @xmath44    let us now go back to the einstein equations .",
    "the off - diagonal components of einstein equations ( [ 13lrsbin ] ) and ( [ 23lrsbin ] ) impose the following restrictions either on the components of the spinor field or on the metric functions :    [ reslrsbi ] @xmath45    the restriction ( [ resmetlrsbi ] ) leads to @xmath46 with @xmath47 being some constant . in this case",
    "the system can be described by a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model from the very beginning . here",
    "we do not consider this case , which we will address in a later work , within the scope of a frw model .",
    "we consider the case when the restriction is imposed on the components of the spinor field in detail .",
    "subtraction of ( [ 33lrsbin ] ) from ( [ 11lrsbin ] ) gives    @xmath48    that leads to @xcite @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 being the integration constants .",
    "thus we see that the metric functions can be expressed in terms of @xmath52 .",
    "the solutions to spinor field equation ( [ speq1 ] ) in this case can be presented as @xcite @xmath53    with @xmath54 , and @xmath55 being the integration constants and related to @xmath56 as @xmath57 here we assumed that @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "the reason for this choice is discussed later .",
    "thus we see that the metric functions , the components of spinor field as well as the invariants constructed from metric functions and spinor fields are some inverse functions of @xmath52 of some degree .",
    "hence any space - time point where @xmath60 is a singular point .",
    "so it is important to study the behavior of @xmath52 , which we do in the next section .",
    "in this section we discuss the results obtained in the previous section . in doing so",
    ", we pay special attention to the volume scale , @xmath52 .",
    "let us first see whether the model becomes asymptotically isotropic .",
    "it can be shown that for an expanding universe , when @xmath61 as @xmath62 , the isotropization process of the universe takes place . to prove that we exploit the isotropization condition proposed in @xcite @xmath63 then by rescaling some of the coordinates , we can make @xmath64 , and the metric will become manifestly isotropic at large @xmath65 .    taking into account that @xmath66 from ( [ metricflrsbi ] ) we find @xmath67 as @xmath61 .",
    "recall that the isotropic frw model has the same scale factor in all three directions ( i.e. , @xmath68 ) .",
    "so for the lrs bi universe to evolve into a frw one we should have @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , the isotropic nature of the present universe leads to the fact that @xmath70 , so that @xmath71^{-1}dt \\to 0 $ ] for @xmath72 ( for @xmath73 with @xmath74 the integral tends to zero as @xmath62 ) .    our next step will be to define @xmath52 . combining the diagonal einstein equations ( [ 11lrsbin ] )  ( [ 00lrsbin ] ) in a certain way for @xmath52 we find @xcite @xmath75    now in order to solve ( [ detvlrsbi ] ) we have to know the relation between the spinor and the gravitational fields . using the equations ( [ s0lrsbi ] ) and ( [ p0lrsbi ] ) it can be show that    @xmath76    relation ( [ kv ] ) holds only for massless spinor field if @xmath9 takes one of the expressions @xmath77 , while for @xmath78 it holds both for massless and massive spinor fields . in the case of",
    "@xmath79 one can write @xmath80 and @xmath81 , whereas for @xmath82 one can write @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in",
    "what follows , we will consider the case for @xmath58 , as in this case further setting spinor mass @xmath85 we can revive the results for other cases . assuming @xmath86 on account of @xmath87 we find    @xmath88 , \\label{detvlrsbinew}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the solution in quadrature @xmath89 + { \\bar c } } } =   t + t_0 , \\label{quadlrsbi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath90 and @xmath91 being some arbitrary constants .",
    "thus we see that the metric functions , the components of the spinor field , as well as the invariants constructed from metric functions and spinor fields are some inverse functions of @xmath52 of some degree . hence any space - time point where @xmath60 is a singular point .",
    "so we consider that the initial value of @xmath92 is small but non - zero . as a result for the nonlinear term to prevail in we should have @xmath93 ( i.e. , @xmath94 ) whereas for an expanding universe when @xmath61 as @xmath95 one should have @xmath96 ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) . as is seen from , @xmath98 leads to a term that can be added to the mass term .",

    "we set @xmath116 , whereas @xmath117 and @xmath118 were taken in different combinations .",
    "it was found that depending on the sign of @xmath119 the model gives principally different types of solutions , namely , in the case of positive @xmath119 we have an accelerated mode of expansion of the universe , while for negative @xmath119 we have oscillatory solution .    defining the deceleration parameter @xmath120 from and we have @xmath121}{3 \\kappa \\left[\\left(m_{\\rm sp } + \\lambda_0\\right )",

    "[ vlrsbipos ] and fig .",
    "[ vlrsbineg ] we plotted the evolution of volume scale @xmath52 for a positive and negative self - coupling constant @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "as one sees from fig .",
    "[ vlrsbipos ] , a positive @xmath119 gives rise to an accelerated mode of expansion , whereas fig .",
    "[ vlrsbineg ] with negative @xmath119 shows the oscillatory mode of expansion . in fig .",
    "[ qlrsbipos ] the deceleration parameter @xmath124 is illustrated for a positive @xmath119 .",
    "finally we study what happens to shear and anisotropic parameters in this case .",
    "in doing so , let us first rewrite the corresponding quantities .",
    "the expansion @xmath125 for lrs bi metric reads @xmath126 whereas , from    [ shearcompslrsbi ] @xmath127    one finds the expression for shear @xmath128 =   \\frac{1}{3 } \\left(\\frac{\\dot a_1}{a_1 } - \\frac{\\dot a_3}{a_3}\\right)^2 . \\label{sheargenlrsbi}\\ ] ] the anisotropic parameter in this case has the form @xmath129   - 1 , \\label{anisoparam}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 .",
    "further from we find that @xmath131 now inserting into  we finally find @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 as was shown in and in the case of a positive @xmath119 that generates late time acceleration , both @xmath52 and @xmath135 become large with the expansion of the universe leading to @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "this corresponds to our earlier conclusion regarding isotropization .",
    "as far as negative @xmath119 is concerned , in this case the model gives rise to an oscillatory mode of expansion . in this case",
    "we have both local minima and maxima .",
    "the maximum ( minimum ) value of volume scale @xmath52 depends on the parameters and the initial condition and may be as large as possible . hence in case of a negative @xmath119 though it is possible to attain a solution such that @xmath139 and @xmath140 , but at the same time we have @xmath141 because at any space - time point where @xmath142 we have @xmath143 .",
    "this means that at any space - time point where evolution changes its direction ( expansion to contraction and vice versa ) the universe becomes highly anisotropic .",
    "within the scope of the lrs bi cosmological model we studied the role of the spinor field in the evolution of the universe .",
    "the reason for considering the lrs bi model lies in the fact that in the case of a full bi model the non - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor of the spinor fields imposes severe restrictions on the components of the spinor field , resulting in vanishing scalar @xmath144 and pseudoscalar @xmath145 @xcite . as a result both the mass term and nonlinear term in the lagrangian disappear .",
    "but , as was shown here , in the case of an lrs bi cosmological model , neither the mass term nor the nonlinear term vanish . moreover , unlike the bianchi type - vi model the present model leads to asymptotic isotropization .",
    "it is was also found that , depending on the sign of the self - coupling constant , the model allows either the accelerated mode of expansion or the oscillatory mode of evolution ."
