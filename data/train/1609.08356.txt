    "a significant part of contemporary nanomaterial research investigates one - dimensional ( 1d ) nanostructures .",
    "research motivations originate from a plethora of applications among medicine@xcite , nanoelectronics@xcite , nanomechanics@xcite , filters@xcite , sensors@xcite , material reinforcement@xcite , and the tailoring of material properties.@xcite some 1d nanostructures are synthesized bottom - up , others fabricated top - down@xcite , and some are simply found directly in the nature.@xcite yet all these nanostructures share one common feature : extreme slenderness . due to large aspect ratios , they are prone to bending , twisting , and stretching , along with their arbitrary combinations .",
    "such deformations are ubiquitous in practice , as proven by numerous experiments.@xcite    but just as eliminating deformations in experiments is hard , incorporating them into theory is even harder .",
    "all deformations are possible in finite structures , but related simulations are plagued by problems .",
    "first , most nanostructures have so many atoms that their straightforward simulation is simply out of question .",
    "second , quantum simulations of finite structures are often deteriorated by finite size artifacts . third , unless specifically designed to mimic experimental settings , mechanical deformation constraints can sabotage the very phenomena under study . and fourth , electronic structure analysis of finite constrained structures is often cumbersome . therefore , 1d nanostructures are best treated by periodic boundary conditions , effectively modeling infinite extensions .",
    "various loading conditions have been investigated earlier , but arbitrary deformations have always been simulated using finite structures.@xcite and although recent methodological advances have enabled simulating also periodic structures under pure twisting and pure bending @xcite , experimental deformations are rarely pure.@xcite electronic structure simulations of 1d nanostructures with realistic , arbitrary deformations have remained elusive .    in this article , therefore , i introduce a technique to model 1d nanostructures with arbitrary deformations . based on revised periodic boundary conditions , it eliminates artifacts related to quantum finite - size effects and mechanical deformation constraints .",
    "it also allows easy electronic structure analysis in studies on electromechanics .",
    "i demonstrate the utility of the technique by revealing surprises in the electromechanical properties of carbon nanotubes and by predicting unconventional structural yielding behavior in au@xmath0 and  nanowires .",
    "to first introduce notations , consider electrons in a potential @xmath1 invariant under an isometric symmetry operation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "since the hamiltonian operator @xmath4 commutes with the operator @xmath5 , the two operators share the same eigenstates .",
    "if we further assume periodic boundary condition after @xmath6 successive operations of @xmath5 , that is @xmath7 , the eigenstates acquire the property @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of symmetry operations and @xmath10 $ ] is a good quantum number used to index the eigenstates .",
    "consequently , the wave function @xmath11 within a minimal unit cell determines the wave function in the entire extended structure .",
    "if the symmetry operation @xmath12 is the translation @xmath13 , the above is obviously nothing but bloch s theorem in one dimension.@xcite the theorem however applies also for symmetries beyond translation , although as yet few implementations exploit this feature.@xcite the formalism of using symmetry and periodicity in this generalized fashion is referred to as revised periodic boundary conditions ( rpbc).@xcite     [ eq .  ( [ eq : s ] ) ] .",
    "arbitrary deformations can be created by simultaneous adjustment of bending ( via @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , twisting ( via @xmath16 ) , and stretching ( via @xmath17 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "the chiral symmetry axis ( dashed curve ) lies in the @xmath18-plane .",
    "the red shaded area sketches the simulation cell . ]",
    "consider then a one - dimensional nanostructure and the symmetry operation @xmath19({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}+ \\mathcal{r}[\\hat{t}(\\phi_s)]({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ) ) ,   \\label{eq : s}\\ ] ] where @xmath20({\\mbox{$\\vec{v}$}})$ ] means rotating a vector @xmath21 an angle @xmath22 with respect to the axis @xmath23 , where the angles @xmath14 and @xmath16 are small ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "successive operation of @xmath24 thus stands for a bending operation around @xmath25-axis combined to a screw operation around gradually reorienting chiral axis with a radius of curvature @xmath15 . compared to previous usage of symmetry ,",
    "the operation ( [ eq : s ] ) conceals one fundamentally novel feature : position - dependence of the operation itself .",
    "this dependence makes the operation in principle non - isometric .",
    "it will turn out , however , that if either @xmath14 or @xmath16 or both are small and if atom positions @xmath26 in the nanostructure have the symmetry @xmath27 , the property of isometry , the symmetry of the potential @xmath28 , and the commutation of operators @xmath29=0 $ ] become valid approximations . due to",
    "the commutation of operators , in the spirit of revised periodic boundary conditions , @xmath11 within a unit cell then suffices to describe the entire extended nanostructure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch]).@xcite although physically sensible structures require that @xmath14 and @xmath16 be integer fractions of @xmath30 , in practice their smallness renders such requirements irrelevant .",
    "that is , by requiring an interaction range small compared to @xmath17 , bending , twisting , and stretching can be regarded as _",
    "deformations , as established earlier.@xcite    consequently , eq.([eq : s ] ) becomes the foundation that enables effective modeling of 1d nanostructures with arbitrary deformations .",
    "deformations are controlled via the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath16 as follows .",
    "first , by considering a structure with diameter @xmath31 , bending can be quantified by the strain @xmath32 . in the absence of axial strain",
    "the bending angle is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the cell length of the undeformed structure , and @xmath35 equals the maximal tensile and compressive strains along the tangential direction .",
    "second , chiral twisting can be quantified by sidewall shear @xmath36 .",
    "third , axial strain can be quantified simply by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the strained axial length .",
    "thus , the three strains @xmath39 fully quantify arbitrary local deformations in 1d nanostructures . note that deformations are created not by external constraints but by underlying symmetries ; all atoms remain fully unconstrained .",
    "i implemented the technique using density - functional tight - binding ( dftb ) method and the hotbit code@xcite . any classical force field or electronic structure method",
    "would have suited equally well , but the dftb formalism allows straightforward implementation and describes the energetics and electronic structures of covalent and even metallic systems with reasonable accuracy.@xcite the pertinent parametrizations were adopted from refs .  , , and .",
    "according to the rpbc formalism@xcite , the dftb electron wave functions under the symmetry ( [ eq : s ] ) are described by the revised bloch basis functions @xmath40 where @xmath41 are minimal set of local orbitals and @xmath42 is the number of unit cells . in this basis",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonal in @xmath43 , @xmath44 where the hamiltonian matrix elements are @xmath45 { { \\rm d}}^3",
    "r. \\label{eq : h - mel}\\ ] ] together with analogous equations for overlap matrix elements , the dftb total energy expression is as usual@xcite , forces are calculated as parametric derivatives of the total energy , and structural relaxation and molecular dynamics are performed in the usual fashion.@xcite the positions of atoms periodic images were mapped exactly via eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) , but for simplicity the orbital rotations @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - mel ] ) were done using the averaged tangential vector of @xmath47 .    finally ,",
    "although the concept of a unit cell is familiar , conceptually intuitive , and visually helpful , here such a concept is in principle unnecessary .",
    "unit cell is even sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] , but in practical implementation it is nowhere to be found , because dftb only requires atoms relative positions , which are fully determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) .",
    "atoms do not need to remain inside certain spatial region .",
    "deformation simulations began with initial guesses for the positions of each atom @xmath48 that were determined from @xmath49(r\\hat{x } + \\mathcal{r}[\\hat{y}(\\chi\\phi_s)](\\tilde{x}_i\\hat{x}+\\tilde{z}_i\\hat{k } ) ) ,   \\label{eq : guess}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 were atom positions in an undeformed 1d nanostructure centered around @xmath51-axis .",
    "the length of the structure was @xmath52 so that the variable @xmath53 ranged from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "simulations then continued either by structural relaxation using the fire optimizer@xcite or by molecular dynamics simulations using langevin thermostat with @xmath56  k temperature and @xmath57  ps damping time .",
    "two notes are worth mentioning here .",
    "first , if @xmath58 , then symmetry operation became @xmath19({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ) ) , \\label{eq : s_psi0}\\ ] ] which made @xmath24 independent of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , in the general case , the radius of curvature for an untwisted , relaxed structure could not be controlled by @xmath24 ; for structure with the symmetry @xmath59 , the control could be regained by setting @xmath60 , thus mimicking the untwisted structure by a chiral symmetry operation .",
    "second , the eigenproblem was faced with occasional technical difficulties when the simulation cell was small and orbitals interacted with their own periodic images ; longer simulation cells removed these difficulties .",

    "dashed line is the curve @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is graphene s shear constant . ]    to validate the technique , i began by investigating single - walled carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) .",
    "they provided a good benchmark for testing , because their mechanical properties have been investigated thoroughly in the past.@xcite in particular , it has been shown that the energetics of carbon nanotubes with sufficiently large diameter follow closely the classical thin sheet elasticity theory with elastic parameters adopted directly from graphene.@xcite    for completeness and for later reference , before proceeding with arbitrary deformations , i verified the thin sheet model with pure bending , pure stretching , and pure twisting of cnts .",
    "the deformation energies under pure deformations agree very well with pertinent analytical estimates , where the related elastic parameters , the young s modulus @xmath66  ev /   and the poisson ratio @xmath67 , were calculated for graphene by dftb ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] ) .",
    "in addition to linear elasticity , non - linear ( bond anharmonicity ) effects cause cnt stretching upon bending , because bonds at inner edge compress less than bonds at outer edge elongate.@xcite assuming a strain - dependent young s modulus of the form @xmath68 with the anharmonicity parameter @xmath69,@xcite the analytically calculated axial strain upon bending becomes @xmath70 , as confirmed by simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energies]b ) .        ) ] for an @xmath71 cnt using periodic ( blue circles ) and finite ( red squares ) simulations .",
    "solid line corresponds to the analytic expression ( [ eq : deformatione ] ) ; @xmath72  % .",

    "that is , deforming began by pure bending , proceeded by additional twisting , further by yet additional stretching , and terminated by the synchronous reversal of bending , twisting , and stretching ( video 1 ) .",
    "the energy per unit length in a cnt under the deformation @xmath39 is @xmath80 which is a superposition of energies under separate pure deformations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] ) .",
    "now , as demonstrated for an @xmath71 cnt , energy from the periodic technique agrees with eq .",
    "( [ eq : deformatione ] ) to high accuracy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : proof]a ) . that is , deforming cnt merely by adjusting the symmetry operation @xmath24 gives accurate deformation energies .",
    "i emphasize that this agreement is not trivial , because in periodic quantum simulations the elastic properties are _ a priori _ indeterminate ; they emanate automatically from the electronic structure , from wave functions , and from wave function symmetries .",
    "the agreement can be therefore considered as a direct validation for the technique and a verification of the underlying approximations .      for comparison ,",
    "i applied the deformation path ( [ eq : path ] ) also to a finite @xmath71 cnt containing @xmath73 unit cells and @xmath76 atoms .",
    "the deformation was constrained by fixing atoms @xmath81 near bottom end and constraining the atoms @xmath82 near top end to move along a trajectory @xmath83 .",
    "for the finite cnt , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deformatione ] ) describes the energy well at small @xmath84 but poorly at large @xmath84 . around @xmath85",
    "the comparison of energies becomes even questionable , because the end constraints of the finite tube could not retain the deformation homogeneous and the tube axis lost its circular arc form ( fig .",
    "[ fig : proof]a ) .",
    "in addition , a single energy and force evaluation step took some thousand times longer for the finite cnt ( @xmath86  h ) than for the periodic cnt ( @xmath87  s ) , and also the number of optimization steps for finite cnt was about ten times larger .",
    "however , the main difference and the true power of the technique lies in the electronic structure analysis .",
    "although the atom count in the finite @xmath71 cnt was @xmath76 , the resulting aspect ratio of @xmath88 was petty compared to the experimental ratios @xmath89 or even @xmath90.@xcite as a result , the density of states ( dos ) from finite simulation was unreliable , as it included spurious end - localized states that arose from quantum finite - size effects ( near the fermi - level in fig .",
    "[ fig : proof]b ) . on the contrary , the electronic structure of periodic cnt",
    "could always be converged by a sufficient number of @xmath75-points .",
    "the dos for the @xmath71 cnt ( fig .",
    "[ fig : proof]b ) was recorded also for the entire deformation path . upon deforming",
    "the van hove singularities remain prominent , but shift to higher and lower energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : electromechanics]a ) .",
    "these shifts are reflected in changes of the fundamental energy gap , as reported earlier for pure deformations.@xcite regarding arbitrary deformations , it turned out that the gap is well described by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the gap change under pure axial strain and @xmath93 corresponding gap change under pure twist ( fig .",
    "[ fig : electromechanics]b ) .",
    "( [ eq : gap_prediction ] ) includes also contribution from axial strain due to bond anharmonicity , as discussed above.@xcite this effect is visible at @xmath94 , where @xmath95 but @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : electromechanics]b ) .",
    "thus , gap changes under arbitrary deformations are given by linear superposition of gap changes in separate _",
    "pure _ deformations . because the superposition is valid for all van hove singularities , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap_prediction ] ) is expected to pertain to optical transitions as well.@xcite the validity of linear superposition could be anticipated , but it has never been demonstrated directly .        the news is , however , that sometimes superposition principle goes awry without a warning .",
    "when considering @xmath97 cnt under the path ( [ eq : path ] ) with @xmath72  % , after @xmath98 the gap starts to behave _ opposite _ as compared to eq.([eq : gap_prediction ] ) ( fig.2c ) . in @xmath97 cnt",
    "pure stretching increases the gap ( inset of fig.2c ) , but the stretching of already bent - and - twisted tube",
    "_ decreases _ the gap .",
    "combination of deformations creates synergy that causes non - linear response in the electronic structure and invalidates linear superposition .",
    "for @xmath97 cnt the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap_prediction ] ) was regained by decreasing @xmath78 down to @xmath99  %  ( not shown ) , but the limits of validity could not be anticipated from cnt electromechanics under separate pure deformations ; confirmation of possible validity required explicit simulations with arbitrary deformations .",
    "i repeated the above analysis with @xmath72  %  for a set of different chiral and non - chiral cnts .",
    "it turned out that the superposition eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap_prediction ] ) is most accurate for zigzag and armchair tubes , and slightly less accurate for chiral tubes ( fig .",

    "the origin for this behavior is unknown and requires further investigation .      ) or armchair ( @xmath100 ) tubes . ]",
    "returning to the mechanical properties of cnts , previous simulations have already shown that chiral tubes display the poynting effect , which means that stretching and twisting are coupled ( twisting induces stretching or the other way around).@xcite while predictions have been made using purely classical models , here the predictions were confirmed by a quantum - mechanical method ( fig .  [",
    "fig : poynting ] ) .    given the poynting effect , the bending - induced axial stretching ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energies]b ) , and the technique to simulate arbitrary deformations , it was pertinent to investigate whether also bending could induce twisting in cnts .",
    "the twisting angle due to bending can be roughly estimated as @xmath101 , where @xmath102 measures the magnitude of the poynting effect . at maximum",
    "the magnitude is @xmath103 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : poynting ] ) , so the largest amount of bending - induced twisting becomes @xmath104 , which turns out to be only @xmath105  %  even at bending as large as @xmath106  % .",
    "a cnt with @xmath107  nm bent to @xmath108  %  would then need to be at least a quarter of a millimeter long to twist a full turn .",
    "being this tiny in magnitude , bending - induced twisting could not be resolved in periodic simulations .",
    "zhao and luo@xcite reported twisting - induced bending , but it was due to the poynting effect combined to a constrained length for a finite tube ; _ intrinsic _ bending - induced stretching in cnts seems to be too minor to be of practical significance .",
    "let us next leave cnts aside and move to studying mos@xmath110 monolayer -derived  nanowires.@xcite these wires are a timely example of deformed 1d nanostructures , as demonstrated by aberration - corrected transmission electron micrographs.@xcite for example , the work of lin _ et al .",
    "_ showed highly resilient  nanowires bent up to @xmath111  % .@xcite undeformed  wires are metallic , but twist of magnitude @xmath112  %  ( assuming wire diameter @xmath113  nm ) has been predicted to open a gap , which was confirmed also here ( fig .  [",
    "fig : mos]a).@xcite as suggested before , these properties could be exploited in an electromechanical switch that allows current propagation in a straight wire but not in a twisted one.@xcite here simulations agree with the previous results under pure bending and pure twisting , but the analysis is more transparent as the band structure can be always plotted for the same minimal cell .",
    "analysis reveals that pure bending creates small energy splittings due to weak wave function localization at inner and outer sides of the wire ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mos]b ) .",
    "analogous localization has been reported also in the vibrational modes of bent cnts.@xcite pure bending affects band structure weakly , but a pre - existing twist enhances the effect of bending notably ( juxtapose the changes in fig .  [ fig : mos]b from upper left to upper right with the changes from lower left to lower right ) .",
    "however , although the twisting - induced metallic - to - semiconducting transition is here seen also under bending , robust electromechanical switching operation should require also structural robustness ; this is what we discuss next .",

    "the minimal @xmath114-atom cell  was stable at least beyond @xmath115  % , as shown above ( lower right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : mos]b ) .",
    "when the simulation cell length was extended to @xmath116  nm , however , atomic structure revealed its sensitivity to combined deformations . when twisted , the elastic energy first depended quadratically on @xmath117 with the torsion constant @xmath118  ev , in fair agreement with the literature.@xcite upon further twisting the energy started to deflect from this quadratic trend and the wire began to yield ( inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : stability]a ) .",
    "most important , the deflection and yielding occurred at rapidly decreasing twist when bending increased . by plotting the yield points of twisting for different @xmath35",
    "it became evident that combining bending and twisting affects stability limits dramatically ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stability]a ) .",
    "for example , the yield limit in purely twisted wire was @xmath119  % , but modest @xmath120  %  bending cut this limit to less than half .",
    "the metal - insulator transition and robust operation of electromechanical switch device is thus feasible only for relatively straight wires ( @xmath121  % ) . besides , temperatures higher than the one used here ( @xmath56  k ) would probably lower the yield limits even further .    although the lowering of twisting yield limit under bending was anticipated , its abruptness was not ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stability]a ) .",
    "the yield limit follows the ad hoc form @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .",
    "this form differs radically from standard yield criteria valid for macroscopic solids , such as the von mises criterion.@xcite the von mises criterion is based on fixed allowed energy density and suggests instead a form @xmath126 with constant @xmath127 s . here",
    "the total energy and thereby energy density at yield point was not fixed , but dropped rapidly when @xmath35 increased ( inset of fig .",

    "i performed similar stability analysis also for a @xmath128  nm - diameter au@xmath0 nanowire with @xmath129  nm long cells.@xcite this nanowire showed yield limits qualitatively similar to those of  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stability]b ) .",
    "atom trajectories revealed that yielding occurred for the entire wire cross section at once , collectively , which helps to appreciate the qualitatively different behavior compared to macroscopic rods and wires .",
    "earlier studies of  and au wires have revealed several dislocations ; these could be indirect indications for the low yield limits under combined deformations.@xcite yet this yielding behavior remains a puzzle that deserves further investigations .    as a final observation , bending and twisting in au@xmath0 turned out to be coupled ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : stability]b ) . at given @xmath35 the energy was minimized at varying twist @xmath130 , following @xmath131 .",
    "that is , unlike in cnts , in au@xmath0 bending induces twisting and twisting induces bending , as familiar from mechanical springs.@xcite",
    "to conclude , i hope to have demonstrated that for a faithful modeling of the mechanical and electromechanical properties of 1d nanostructures , simple modeling with separate pure deformations is insufficient ; explicit simulations of combined deformations are mandatory .",
    "demand for such simulations grows as the control over 1d nanostructures improves .",
    "perspective for this demand can be obtained by considering the list of related nanostructure examples , which include metal , semiconductor and molecular nanowires , dna , polymers , single- and multiwalled cnts , cnt ropes and bundles , nanoribbons of graphene and other 2d materials , among many others .",

    "<S> a powerful technique is introduced for simulating mechanical and electromechanical properties of one - dimensional nanostructures under arbitrary combinations of bending , twisting , and stretching . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is based on a novel control of periodic symmetry , which eliminates artifacts due to deformation constraints and quantum finite - size effects , and allows transparent electronic structure analysis . via density - functional tight - binding implementation </S>",
    "<S> , the technique demonstrates its utility by predicting novel electromechanical properties in carbon nanotubes and abrupt behavior in the structural yielding of au@xmath0 and  nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> the technique drives simulations markedly closer to the realistic modeling of these slender nanostructures under experimental conditions . </S>"
