    "long baseline interferometric gravitational - wave detectors such as ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo600 @xcite or tama300 @xcite are now in their phase of construction , and should be fully operational in the first years of the next millenium .",
    "sources of gravitational waves that are expected in the bandwidth of these detectors , all involve compact objects such as black holes ( bh ) or neutron stars ( ns ) ; see @xcite or @xcite for a review . among them , inspiraling binaries seem to be the most promising sources for a first direct detection of gravitational waves .",
    "accordingly , a huge effort has been done up to now in order to be ready in time for analysing the inspiraling binaries data delivered by the interferometric detectors : detection of the signal by correlation with suitable templates ( matched filtering ) , see e.g @xcite or by time - frequency analysis @xcite , and estimation of astrophysical parameters ( mainly the masses of the stars and their spins ) @xcite . this part of gravitational - wave data analysis , concerning inspiraling compact binaries , is now well advanced and rather well understood . besides , periodic sources such as rotating neutron stars are maybe as interesting as the binary inspirals , since , despite the low expected gravitational waves amplitudes , these sources have the advantage of being permanent .",
    "a number of studies has been also dedicated to the analysis of periodic sources : see e.g @xcite or @xcite and references therein .",
    "historically , supernovae ( sn ) were the first envisaged gravitational - wave emitters and first resonant detectors have been designed to be sensitive around the typical frequencies expected in such bursts of gravitational radiation , around 1 khz . with the construction of intrinsically broadband inteferometric detectors ,",
    "this kind of sources has not been studied as much as inspiraling binaries or pulsars .",
    "expected sources of burst gravitational waves are first collapses of massive stars to neutron stars ( type ii sn ) or to black holes .",
    "modern simulations of the former show a rather small efficiency of gravitational radiation emission @xcite : amplitudes typically less than @xmath0 are expected for sn at the distance of the virgo cluster .",
    "nevertheless , observation of very fast pulsars in the galaxy ( such as the one in the guitar nebula @xcite ) may indicate that , at least in some cases , the collapse can be highly asymmetric and provides much higher gravitational wave strain amplitudes @xcite .",
    "estimates of gravitational wave amplitudes from the collapse to a bh reach similar orders of magnitude as for previous type ii sn @xcite .",
    "another possible source of gravitational wave bursts occurs during the merging of two compact stars , at the very end of the binary inspiral .",
    "if the inspiral signal for binary neutrons stars is well understood up to the 2.5 post - newtonian order @xcite , we know only little about the signal waveform corresponding to the merging phase itself , since its computation requires in particular fully relativistic hydrodynamical codes , although some semi - classical attempts have already been performed , see e.g. @xcite . some recent estimates @xcite give a maximum amplitude @xmath1 a few @xmath2 at 10 mpc within a frequency range of 1 - 2 khz .",
    "this is just the order of magnitude of the noise level at these frequencies for interferometric detectors in their initial design ; that leaves some hope for a future detection .",
    "concerning bh binaries , an ambitious program called the binary black hole grand challenge alliance @xcite is underway to handle the very difficult task of computing the waveform of the merging phase .",
    "damped oscillations of excited bh s or ns s , like baby born ns s ( just after the collapse ) , can also provide gravitational waves with detectable amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the corresponding waveforms are not really bursts like , they rather have some coherent structure ( they look like typically a damped sine )",
    ". however , their characteristic frequencies , above hundreds of hz to tens of khz , and their short damping times , make them belong to the category of signals of interest in this article .",
    "note that the frequencies and damping times are exactly known for kerr bh @xcite and the detection of gravitational waves emitted by such a perturbed bh could provide a direct measurement of both its mass and its angular momentum @xcite ; of course , in this case , matched filtering , with damped sine templates , is the more suitable method .",
    "all these gravitational wave burst signals have the following features : short durations from milliseconds to seconds , frequencies from @xmath3 100 hz to few khz and a large range of waveforms .",
    "filtering of such short signals in the ouput of interferometric detectors should therefore be as general or robust as possible , and designed with ( almost ) no _ a priori _ knowledge on the waveforms ; this prescription of course forbids the optimal ( wiener ) filtering as used for inspiraling binaries .",
    "such general filtering methods are then necessarily `` sub - optimal '' , in the sense that they are less efficient than the optimal filtering . in this article , we concentrate on the filtering of one detector s output , which is the first step in a detection process , the second one being the reconstruction of the gravitational wave signal from the filtered outputs of ( at least ) three detectors . the second step has been already studied in detail @xcite , while the first has attracted so far little attention in the litterature . here , we study three filtering ideas for the detection of bursts in the data of interferometric gravitational - wave detectors , two of them being very general and the third one more specific .",
    "these methods are namely a `` counting '' method , where we count the number of bins which are larger than some threshold in a certain window , then a method based on the autocorrelation function of the detector data and finally a filtering based on the correlation of the data with a peak generic function . for each of them",
    ", we develop the statistical properties : link to gaussian statistics , number of false alarms , threshold definition ... in order to quantify the performances of such filters , we use as gravitational wave signals the sn catalogue from zwerger and mller available on the web @xcite , and compute , as a benchmark , for each of them , the maximal distance of detection obtained by the three filters ; as a reference , we compare to the maximal detection distance calculated by optimal filtering .",
    "for this purpose , we will use , as a model for the detector noise , the minimum of the virgo sensitivity , which occurs precisely in the range of frequencies of interest .",
    "of course , any burst filtering is unable to distinguish a non - stationary noise from a real gravitational wave event  : such filterings will be sensitive to transient noise as well as to gravitational bursts .",
    "the goal of burst filtering in one detector is then mainly to act as a trigger and select interesting data streams in order to investigate coincidences with other detectors .",
    "it will also be useful to identify and study non - stationary noise in a single interferometric detector , ultimately providing vetos or cleaning procedures for `` known '' non - stationary noise sources .",
    "finally , it is stressed that a general filtering approach , such as those proposed below , will be sensitive to unexpected sources and therefore may provide some insight into new physics .",
    "since we know little about the expected waveforms of burst gravitational - wave sources a robust filtering is required . since such a filtering",
    "is wished to work as an on - line trigger , it should be fast .",
    "we study three of such filters in the following . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume that the detector noise is white , stationary and gaussian with zero mean . for the numerical estimates ,",
    "we chose the flat ( amplitude ) spectral density to be @xmath4 and the sampling frequency @xmath5 khz , so the standard deviation of the noise is @xmath6 ; we will note the sampling time @xmath7 .",
    "the value chosen for @xmath8 corresponds approximately to the minimum of the sensitivity curve of the virgo detector @xcite ; around this minimum , the sensitivity is rather flat , in the range @xmath3 [ 200 hz,1khz ] , which is precisely the range of interest for the gravitational wave bursts we are interested in .",
    "this validates then our assumption of a white noise ; otherwise , we can always assume that the detector output has been first whitened by a suitable filter @xcite .",
    "the principle of this first filtering method is quite simple . a data stream of length @xmath9 being given ( so containing @xmath10 data ) , we count the number of data ( bins ) whose value exceed a certain threshold , say @xmath11 , in unit of the noise standard deviation .",
    "the method is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "it follows the prescription about no preconceived idea about the waveforms to detect . in the absence of signal , the noise being gaussian ,",
    "the probability that a data bin @xmath12 is larger than @xmath11 is : @xmath13 it is then straightforward that @xmath14 , the number of bins above threshold , follows a binomial distribution and the probability that @xmath15 is @xmath16^n   \\left [ 1-{\\mathrm erfc}\\left ( \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\right)\\right]^{n - n},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the complementary error function .",
    "setting @xmath18 , the mean of @xmath14 is then @xmath19 and its standard deviation is @xmath20 .",
    "it is well known that the normalised random variable @xmath21 behaves like a normalised gaussian variable , as soon as @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "these conditions will be fullfilled in every situation of interest , so we will consider now that the random variable @xmath24 is well approximated by a standard normal one .",
    "two parameters are involved in this method : the window length @xmath9 ( or equivalently @xmath25 ) and the thresold @xmath26 .",
    "we will discuss the window length later , with the other filtering methods . on the contrary",
    ", the choice of @xmath26 is a specific issue for this approach .",
    "first , @xmath26 should not be too large , as we expect low amplitude signals .",
    "then , @xmath26 should not be too small because then the filter would become very sensitive to the noise fluctuations with the drawback of a huge number of false alarms ; as an example , if @xmath27 , @xmath28% , giving in average 46 counts in a window of @xmath29 sampled data .",
    "the optimal value for @xmath26 is evaluated as follows : we compute the average distance of detection for the supernovae signals of the zwerger and mller catalogue as a function of @xmath26 ; the calculation of this distance is explained with full details in section [ section detection ] .",
    "of course , many realisations of the noise are generated and the results are averaged in order to reduce the influence of noise fluctutations . the result can be seen in fig.2 .",
    "we choose accordingly @xmath30 in all the following , but any value of @xmath26 in the range [ 1.4,2.0 ] would also be reasonnable ( giving a loss up to 10% in the average distance of detection with respect to the maximum ) .",
    "this method has been initiated by the remark that white noise samplings are uncorrelated , while this is in general not true for a gravitational - wave signal .",
    "so the autocorrelation @xmath31 of the detector output @xmath32 should reveal the presence of a correlated signal hidden in a uncorrelated noise .",
    "however , two problems arise : the computing time ( depending on the window length ) and the choice of the detection criterion",
    ". the norm of the autocorrelation function seems a good one , since it should probably distinguish between noise and noise plus signal .",
    "but the squared norm of the aucorrelation of a gaussian discrete variable is generally not a gaussian variable itself : it becomes gaussian only for very long data windows , as we have checked , and so it requires prohibitive calculation times .",
    "we could live with non - gaussian statistics however , but we first require simplicity for these preliminary studies .",
    "this is why we turn our attention to the maximum of the autocorrelation , which is nothing but the squared norm of the output @xmath32 , since the autocorrelation of any function is maximal at zero . for the @xmath25 sampled data in a window of size @xmath33 ,",
    "the output of this filter is then @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the i@xmath36 data in the window . when no signal is present , @xmath35 is pure noise and , under our assumption of gaussian noise , @xmath37 , being the square of a gaussian random variable , is a chi - square random variable with one degree of freedom .",
    "@xmath38 is then the sum of @xmath25 such chi - square random variables with one degree of freedom , which is a chi - square random random variable with @xmath25 degrees of freedom .",
    "its mean is @xmath39 and its standard deviation is @xmath40 . if @xmath41 , the random variable ( related to the norm of the windowed detector output ) @xmath42 is very well approximated by a standard normal variable @xcite",
    "this fits the simplicity requirement and we will then use the output of @xmath43 as a filter .",
    "the only parameter for this filter is the window size @xmath25 ; it will be discussed in the next section .      since many of the expected waveforms present one or several peaks",
    ", it seems judicious to use single pulses as filters .",
    "these pulses are modelised with truncated gaussian functions like : @xmath44 with @xmath45 lying in the range @xmath46 $ ] , so that the function is truncated at about 1% of its maximum value .",
    "the only parameter for this set of pulse filters is the width @xmath47 .",
    "the discrete correlation between the data @xmath48 and the pulse can be written as : @xmath49t_s)\\ ] ] in the absence of a signal , the output of the filter @xmath50 is a gaussian random variable , as a sum of gaussian random variables weighted by the pulse fonction .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath51 is simply the square root of the sum of the squared weigths : @xmath52t_s)^2},\\ ] ] which can be recast as @xmath53 we can then define a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) as the filter output normalised by the standard deviation @xmath54 : @xmath55 , where @xmath51 is the maximum of the function defined in eq.(2.6 ) .",
    "the two first methods bc and nf are very easy to implement in practice , as we can write simple recurrence relations for the calculation of the filter outputs in a given window , as function of the filter outputs in the previous window .",
    "for instance , for the bc , the output of the filter in a window of length @xmath25 starting at the @xmath56 datum @xmath57 and ending at the datum @xmath58 is @xmath59 .",
    "the next filter output @xmath60 is obtained by moving the window by one bin , namely starting now at the datum @xmath61 and ending at the datum @xmath62 .",
    "the relation between @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be cast as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 if the datum @xmath35 is above threshold @xmath11 and @xmath65 if @xmath35 is below .",
    "similarily , for the nf , in the window of length @xmath25 starting at the datum @xmath61 , the norm of the data is @xmath66 and is simply related to @xmath67 by @xmath68 .",
    "this recurrence relation between @xmath69 and @xmath67 allows a very fast calculation of the filter output @xmath70 to be performed from the calculation of the previous filter output @xmath71 .",
    "one advantage of this practical simplicity for both methods allows the computation of filter outputs with a window moving from bin to bin , which is not always possible ( and anyway not necessary ) in case of correlations with a predefined lattice of filters .",
    "concerning the pc , we have first to built the lattice of filter , depending on only one parameter , the gaussian peak standard deviation @xmath47 .",
    "the parameter space is the interval @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "the distance between two successive filters of the lattice is noted @xmath73 and the problem is to estimate @xmath73 , which is _ a priori _ a function of @xmath47 .",
    "the output of the correlation between a gaussian peak filter @xmath74 and a `` signal '' @xmath75 is  : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a constant . if @xmath75 is itself a filter of the kind @xmath78 , it is easy to show that the maximal correlation is obtained for @xmath79 .",
    "following @xcite , we chose @xmath73 such that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the allowed loss in the signal to noise ratio .",
    "expanding the ratio of eq.[ratio ] to second order in @xmath82 leads to the simple inequality @xmath83 if the gaussian filter @xmath74 of width @xmath47 belongs to the lattice , then the next one @xmath84 is then built from @xmath85 starting from the first filter of width @xmath86 , it is then easy to built the k@xmath36 filter : its width is @xmath87 .",
    "the total number of templates in the lattice is finally the maximal integer @xmath88 such that @xmath89 .",
    "for example , fig.3 shows the distribution of the 117 templates in the interval [ 1ms,10ms ] for a loss in snr @xmath90 ( the one we will use in the next section ) ; the choice of @xmath91 reduces the number of filters to 13 for the same interval .",
    "we notice that we can allow for a very low loss in snr and still obtain a reasonable number of templates ; this is due both to the fact that we deal with an one - dimensional lattice space and to the smooth dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath81 .",
    "for instance , the same very low value of @xmath92 and a parameter space extended to the ( physically possible ) interval [ 1ms,1s ] lead to a lattice of only 349 templates , which is easy to implement for an on - line processing .      since the outputs of the three proposed filters behave like standard normal random variables ( when no signal is present ) , it is convenient to define the same detection threshold for all , with , consequently , the same number of false alarms produced .",
    "as we expect weak signals , this threshold has to be low . on the other hand",
    ", we can deal with a large number of false alarms ; these spurious events can be processed and discarded later when working in coincidence with other detectors .",
    "the relation between the detection threshold @xmath93 and the rate of false alarms @xmath94 for a gaussian random variable  : @xmath95 a false alarm rate @xmath96 ( @xmath97 false alarms per hour for a sampling rate @xmath98 khz ) corresponds to a threshold @xmath99 , while a false alarm rate 10 times smaller corresponds to @xmath100 . for the results presented in the following ) , the chosen threshold is @xmath99 .",
    "for the two first filtering methods , bc and nf , the situation is however not so simple because the outputs of the filters in two successive windows are in fact strongly correlated .",
    "for example , for the bc filtering , the filter outputs in two successive windows ( starting respectively at the datum @xmath57 and @xmath61 are related by eq.[recbin ] ; it is clear that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the same or differ at most by @xmath101 .",
    "so if the detection threshold is exceeded in a number of consecutive windows , there is in general only one `` event '' .",
    "this leads to redefine what is a detected event : an event is said to be detected in some time interval @xmath102 $ ] if the filter output @xmath103 exceeds the threshold @xmath93 for all values of @xmath104 in the interval @xmath105 $ ] and is less than @xmath93 outside .",
    "this is equivalent to define a correlation length @xmath106 for the event to be detected .",
    "in this section , we use the catalogue of simulated gravitational - wave signals emitted during supernovae collapses and computed by zwerger and mller @xcite , to implement and test the three filterings described previously , in a realistic context .",
    "the catalogue of zwerger and mller @xcite contains 78 gravitational - wave signals generated by axisymmetric core collapses .",
    "note that , in particular due to axisymmetry , these are purely linearly polarized waves ( @xmath107 ) . each of them corresponds to a particular set of parameters , essentially the initial distribution of angular momentum and the rotational energy of the star core , in the collapse models of zwerger and mller .",
    "the signal total durations range from about 40 ms to a little more than 200 ms .",
    "the gravitational wave amplitudes of the stronger signals are of the order @xmath108 a few @xmath109 for a source located at 10mpc ; that leaves little hope to detect such events with the first generation detectors .",
    "concerning the shape of the waveforms ( see fig.4 ) , zwerger and mller distinguish three different types of signals@xcite .",
    "type i signals typically present a first peak ( associated to the bounce)followed by a ringdown .",
    "type ii signals show a few ( 2 - 3 ) decreasing peaks , with a time lag between the first two of at least 10ms .",
    "type iii signals exhibit no strong peak but fast ( @xmath3 1 khz ) oscillations after the bounce .",
    "the fact that type i and type ii signals are characterised by strong peaks validates the choice of the filtering by correlation with generic peaks in order to detect such events .",
    "the 78 signal templates in the catalogue are not equally sampled , so we have first re - sampled them by interpolation at the desired sampling frequency ( @xmath98khz in our examples ) .",
    "since the 78 signal waveforms are known , we can explicitely derive the optimal snr provided by the wiener filter for each of them , and then compute the maximal distance of detection",
    ". we will then be able to build a benchmark for the different filters by comparing their results ( detection distances ) to the results of the wiener filter .",
    "in all the following , we assume that the incoming waves have an optimal incidence with respect to the interferometric detector .    let s call @xmath110 one of the 78 signals and @xmath111 its fourier transform .",
    "the optimal signal to noise ratio @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the one - sided noise power spectral density ( hence the factor of 2 ) .",
    "the noise is assumed to be gaussian and white with a standard deviation related to the constant spectral density @xmath115 by @xmath116 .",
    "the snr then becomes @xmath117 as previously , a supernova signal is detected by the wiener filter if @xmath118 , where @xmath93 is the same detection threshold as defined above .",
    "fig.5 shows the maximal distance of detection for each of the 78 signals .",
    "the mean distance , averaged over all the signals , is about 26.1kpc , which is of the order of the diameter of the milky way .",
    "a few signals can be detected at distances beyond 50kpc , the distance of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the most energetic signals ( number 77 and 78 ) can be detected at distances as high as 100 - 120 kpc .",
    "it is clear that this class of signals will be detected by the first generation inteferometric detectors only if the supernovae occur inside our galaxy or in the very close neighbourhood .",
    "the window size @xmath25 for the first two filters is a compromise between the need for not too small number of bins , in order to garantee that the filter outputs are well approximated by gaussian random variables , and the rather short signals we are looking for . the first constraint is easily fulfilled for the nf method , where @xmath25 must be larger than about 30 . for the bc method",
    ", we must have @xmath119 and @xmath120 ; with the optimal choice of @xmath121 , so that @xmath122 , the two inequalities give respectively @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the constraints are not very severe and require that @xmath25 must be between 80 and 150 , as it has been checked by monte - carlo simulations ( looking for the optimal window size giving the maximal mean distance of detection ) .    for the pulse filter pc ,",
    "the window size is automatically fixed by the definition interval of the gaussian peak @xmath125 $ ] for a filter of width @xmath47 .",
    "the window size for the correlation with the filter @xmath74 is then @xmath126 and depends then on @xmath47 .",
    "the efficiency of each filter is measured by the maximal distance of detection for each of the 78 gravitational wave signals of the catalogue .",
    "this distance is obtained by averaging over many noise realisations in a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "we present the results in two ways .",
    "fig.6 shows the number of detected signals as a function of the distance of detection for the three filters .",
    "results of fig.6 combined with the results for the optimal filtering ( fig.5 ) are reported in fig.7 in a normalised way .",
    "the histograms in fig.7 show the number of signals detected as a function of the reduced distance of detection for the three filters ; the reduced distance of detection is simply the distance of detection divided by the maximal distance of detection computed with the optimal filter .",
    "the means of the distributions are respectively 0.22 , 0.26 and 0.34 for the bc , nf and pc filters ; these can be seen as rough estimators of the efficiency of the filters .",
    "the histograms in fig.7 give also an idea of the sensitivity of the filters to the waveforms of the detected signals .",
    "we note that the histograms corresponding to the bc and nf filters are much more concentrated than the one corresponding to the pc filter ; this is particularly impressive for the nf filter .",
    "this means that the two first filters are rather robust and their efficiency does not crucially depend on the details of the gravitational wave signals . at the contrary",
    ", the larger dispersion of the last histogram ( pc ) indicates that the response of the pc filter depends much more on the gravitational waveform .",
    "the global efficiency can be measured as the mean detection distance averaged over the 78 signals .",
    "the results are reported in table 1 .",
    "the efficiency of the bc and nf filters are about one third of the efficiency of the optimal filtering ( max .",
    "efficiency ) , while the pc filter ( for @xmath90 ) has an efficiency about 58% of the maximal efficiency .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 : detection distance averaged over the 78 signals for the different filters .",
    "we note that none of the bc , nf and pc filters is efficient enough to cover all the galaxy on average .",
    "several signals however can be seen anywhere from the galaxy and even beyond ; in particular the signals 77 and 78 can be detected up to the lmc by any of the three filters .",
    "in fact , concerning the pc filter , the mean distance of detection depends on @xmath81 , the allowed loss in snr , and consequently on the number of filters in the lattice .",
    "fig.8 shows the mean distance of detection as a function of the loss in snr .",
    "as @xmath81 decreases , the mean distance of detection becomes closer to the maximal value ( a little larger than 15 kpc ) .",
    "we also notice that for high values of @xmath81 ( low number of templates ) , for instance above @xmath127 ( 13 templates ) , the efficiency of the pc filter is still well larger than the nf / bc efficiency .",
    "apart form the criterion of simplicity of the filters , we require also that the data processing with these filters has to be fast enough to be implemented on - line as a trigger .",
    "an analysis of one day of data has been performed ( in order to check the validity of the redefinition of an event -see section ii.e- and the number of false alarms ) on a dec alpha workstation , in about 14mn with the bc filtering and in about 25mn with the nf filtering .",
    "so there is about a factor 100 ( resp .",
    "57 ) between the data stream duration and the time needed to process them by the bc filter ( resp .",
    "the nf filter ) .",
    "these two filters can then be used on - line without any problem .",
    "the pc filter is no more problematic due to implementation in the fourier space and use of fft s .",
    "moreover the correlations do nt need to be computed in successive windows .",
    "indeed a template @xmath128 ( gaussian of width @xmath26 ) has a certain correlation length ( @xmath129 ) , so it is possible to compute the correlation with the template @xmath128 every @xmath130 , where @xmath130 is related to the allowed loss in filter efficiency . in practice , one order of magnitude on the calculation time can be gained with a loss of 1 - 2 % of efficiency .",
    "we have studied in this paper three filtering methods with the aim of building on - line triggers for the selection of burst - like events in the data flow of interferometric gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "such a filtering needs first to be as general and as simple as possible ; these two prescriptions are well fulfilled by the two first : bc and nf filterings . a third filter",
    "has then be studied in order to quantify what could be the gain with a more specific filtering , i.e. using some _ a priori _ information on the signals to detect ( namely here the fact that the supernova signals contain at least one peak of short duration ) .",
    "the catalogue of supernova gravitational - wave signals provided by zwerger and mller has been used in order to built a benchmark for the different filters in a realistic way , and to compare each of them to the optimal ( wiener ) filter .",
    "the results we find is first that a general filter , such as bc of nf , has an efficiency of about one third ( 0.30 - 0.36 ) of the efficiency of the optimal filter ( maximal efficiency for a linear filter ) .",
    "the peak correlator pc ( looking for the peaks in the zwerger and mller signals ) has a efficiency slightly larger ( 58% of the optimal filter efficiency ) .",
    "we note also that the general filters seem to be more robust ( less sensitive to the waveform details ) than the peak correlator , because of the smaller dispersion of their ( normalized ) responses to the 78 supernovae signals .",
    "the results for the detection of the zwerger and mller signals are not very optimistic . moreover , as we have assumed optimal incidence for the gravitational waves , the detection distances should be divided by @xmath131 for sources randomly distributed over the sky @xcite .",
    "so only a small fraction of the supernova events can be detected anywhere in the galaxy or beyond .",
    "this is not a surprise , and , anyway , not the main point of this paper .",
    "we finally notice that the two general burst filters bc and nf we studied are in fact non - linear filters ( they can not be reduced to a correlation with the detector output )",
    ". this may encourage people to develop and study such a class of filters in the context of gravitational wave detection . in the near future",
    ", we plan to study other filters based on the autocorrelation function and on wavelets analysis .",
    "we plan also to study the effect of a more realistic noise on the response of this class of filters , in particular the effect of non - gaussianity and non - stationarity .",
    "we keep in mind that non stationary noises can be treated as signals and the burst filtering can help to identify them and finally understand the detector behavior .",

    "<S> we study in this paper some filters for the detection of burst - like signals in the data of interferometric gravitational - wave detectors . </S>",
    "<S> we present first two general ( non - linear ) filters with no _ a priori _ assumption on the waveforms to detect . </S>",
    "<S> a third filter , a peak correlator , is also introduced and permits to estimate the gain , when some prior information is known about the waveforms . </S>",
    "<S> we use the catalogue of supernova gravitational - wave signals built by zwerger and mller in order to have a benchmark of the performance of each filter and to compare to the performance of the optimal filter . </S>",
    "<S> the three filters could be a part of an on - line triggering in interferometric gravitational - wave detectors , specialised in the selection of burst events .    </S>",
