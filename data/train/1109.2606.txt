    "symmetries play a central role in the understanding of physical phenomena .",
    "the laws governing the fundamental interactions in gauge theories and general relativity are strongly based on symmetry principles . on the other hand",
    "the developments of non - perturbative methods to study strongly coupled system rely on symmetries revealed by deep structures like the weak - strong coupling dualities in gauge theories .",
    "even though the noether symmetries of lagrangians and equations of motion are very important in many aspects of a given theory , it is perhaps correct to say that the hidden symmetries are the ones that have proved to be most efficient in the development of exact methods for non - linear and non - perturbative phenomena .",
    "the best examples of that are low dimensional theories with applications in many areas of physics like condensed matter , integrable field theories and solitons .",
    "the hidden symmetries responsible for the solvability of those @xmath1-dimensional theories appear in general as gauge symmetries of an auxiliary flat one - form connection @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , the connection is a functional of the physical fields , and the zero curvature condition for @xmath4 is equivalent to the classical equations of motion of the theory .",
    "the crucial fact here is that the flatness condition imply that the path ordered integral of the connection between two given points is independent of the choice of the path joining them .",
    "that statement is a conservation law , and the conserved quantities are given by the eigenvalues of the operator obtained by the path ordered integral of @xmath4 over the entire one dimensional space sub - manifold .",
    "the exact developments in soliton theories and in many non - linear phenomena in low dimensions , over the last decades , were a direct consequence of that very important and simple fact .",
    "if higher dimensional theories present similar structures or not is an open and interesting problem . there have been several approaches to tackle that question , and we want to discuss here one which is a quite straightforward generalization of the ideas described above .",
    "one should expect the conserved quantities of a @xmath5 dimensional theory to be associated to integrals of quantities on the @xmath6-dimensional space sub - manifold .",
    "however , that space can be seen as a path in a generalized loop space in the following way .",
    "choose a reference point @xmath7 in the @xmath8-dimensional space - time @xmath9 , and defined the space of maps @xmath10 from the @xmath11-dimensional sphere @xmath12 into @xmath9 , such that the north pole of @xmath12 is always mapped into @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath13 . the images of those maps are @xmath11-dimensional closed hyper - surfaces @xmath14 in @xmath9 based at @xmath7 , and each one of them corresponds to a point of @xmath10 .",
    "given a @xmath6-dimensional hyper - volume in @xmath9 , one can scan it with a collection of those closed hyper - surfaces @xmath14 .",
    "such collection is a path in @xmath10 , and so the hyper - volume in @xmath9 can be seen as a path in the loop space @xmath10 .",
    "the idea now is , for a given theory in @xmath9 , to look for a one - form connection @xmath15 in @xmath10 , such that the conditions for its curvature to vanish are equivalent to the classical equations of motion of that physical theory .",
    "the flatness condition for @xmath15 implies that its path ordered integral between two given points in @xmath10 ( hyper - surfaces in @xmath9 ) is independent of the choice of path ( hyper - volume in @xmath9 ) joining them .",
    "that would lead , in a similar way to @xmath1-dimensional theories , to conserved quantities as the eigenvalues of the path ordered integral of @xmath15 over the paths corresponding to the @xmath6-dimensional space sub - manifold .",
    "that is the approach put forward in @xcite and implemented in several examples of field theories in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "see @xcite for a review of the interesting results obtained . among the difficulties of the approach are those associated to the non - locality and to the reparameterization invariance of the physical quantities .",
    "note that a given hyper - volume in @xmath9 corresponds in fact to an infinite number of paths in @xmath10 , which is a consequence of the infinity of ways of scanning it with hyper - surfaces .",
    "so , the physical phenomena should not depend upon the change of scanning . despite those difficulties it was possible to impose local conditions in @xmath9 which lead to the vanishing of the curvature of the connection @xmath15 in the loop space @xmath10 , and made the physical quantities reparameterization invariant @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to use the very same ideas proposed in @xcite to construct conserved quantities for a large class of theories , which include integrable field theories in @xmath1 dimensions , chern - simons theories with sources in @xmath2 dimensions , and yang - mills theories in @xmath2 and @xmath3 dimensions . however , instead of looking for a connection in loop space which zero curvature condition is equivalent to the classical equations of motion , we propose an integral form of those equations , related to generalizations of the non - abelian stokes theorem , and which lead in a quite simple and direct way to the conservation laws .",
    "consider a physical theory in a @xmath8-dimensional simply connected space - time @xmath9 , and let @xmath16 be any ( in some sense topologically trivial ) @xmath6-dimensional hyper - volume in @xmath9 , and suppose that the dynamics of such theory can be described by integral equations of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the border of @xmath16 , and where @xmath19 and @xmath20 stand for hyper - surface and hyper - volume ordering integrations respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 are built out of @xmath23 and @xmath6 forms in @xmath9 respectively , and which are functionals of the physical fields .",
    "the details of the construction will be given in the examples discussed in the next sections .",
    "however , we deal with local field theories and the equations are a direct consequence of the local differential equations of motion of the theory and of some generalization of the non - abelian stokes theorem . on the other hand ,",
    "since is valid on any hyper - volume @xmath16 , it turns out that imply those local differential equations when @xmath16 is taken to be infinitesimally small . in order to define",
    "the ordered integrations in we scan @xmath16 with @xmath11-dimensional closed hyper - surfaces based on a reference point @xmath7 on its border @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the equations are not really defined on each @xmath16 , but on the generalized loop space @xmath24 , i.e. the space of mappings from the @xmath11-dimensional sphere @xmath12 to @xmath16 , such that its north pole is always mapped into @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , @xmath16 can be seen as a path in @xmath25 , and the r.h.s .",
    "of is defined on such a path , with the l.h.s .",
    "of being evaluated on its end points .",
    "but there is an infinite number of paths in @xmath25 corresponding to the same @xmath16 .",
    "when one changes the choice of path representing @xmath16 , both sides of change .",
    "however , the non - abelian stokes theorem leading to guarantees that the changes are such that both sides of remain equal .",
    "therefore , transforms `` covariantly '' under change of parameterization of @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , we show in the next sections that transforms covariantly under gauge transformations associated to the differential forms leading to the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    an important consequence of the integral form of the equations of motion is that if one considers a closed hyper - volume @xmath26 , i.e. without border , then the l.h.s of becomes trivial and one gets that p_de^__c j = note that @xmath26 corresponds to a closed path in @xmath27",
    ". then let us choose an intermediate point on that path , i.e. a closed @xmath11-dimensional hyper - surface @xmath14 , such that @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the part of @xmath26 going from the infinitesimal hyper - surface @xmath30 around the reference point @xmath7 to @xmath14 , and @xmath31 to the part going from @xmath14 back to @xmath30 .",
    "then , the ordered integration implies that @xmath32 .",
    "the order may be reversed depending upon the definition of the ordered integration . by reverting the sense of integration along the path one",
    "gets the inverse operator , and so one can rewrite that relation as @xmath33 , with @xmath34 being the path @xmath31 in reversed order . since that is valid for any closed path passing through @xmath30 and @xmath14 , one concludes that the operator @xmath35 is independent of the path @xmath16 joining @xmath30 and @xmath14 .",
    "that path independency is a conservation law , and by choosing appropriate boundary conditions as we explain in the next sections , one gets that the conserved charges are the eigenvalues of the operator obtained by the path ordered integral @xmath35 , with @xmath16 corresponding to the whole space sub - manifold . in the examples we discuss such conserved charges",
    "are shown to be gauge invariant , and independent of the parameterization of the hyper - volumes as well as of the choice of the reference point @xmath7 . in the case where the space - time is of the form @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being the time , and @xmath38 being a space sub - manifold without border , i.e @xmath39",
    ", then one gets from that @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , such operator is not only constant in time but trivial . in many cases ,",
    "that topological property of the space - time leads to quantization of charges .",
    "that is a very important consequence of our construction .",
    "even though we have not introduced a one - form connection in the loop space @xmath25 , that concept is hidden in the quantity @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , since we use generalizations of the non - abelian stokes theorem , the quantity @xmath22 corresponds to some sort of curvature of the quantity @xmath21 , now seen as a connection on a lower loop space @xmath41 , made of the space of maps of the @xmath42-dimensional sphere @xmath43 to the border @xmath44 of @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , there must be some sort of poincar lemma playing a role here , implying that the curvature of a connection which is already a curvature should vanish .",
    "so , in that sense @xmath22 would play the role of the flat connection in the approach proposed in @xcite .",
    "note however that the integral form of the equations of motion does not require the introduction of a connection in loop space to obtain conserved quantities for the theories we consider in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:1 + 1 ] we implement our construction for integrable field theories in @xmath45 dimensions re - obtaining well known results in that research area using the integral form of the equations of motion . in section [ sec:2 + 1 ] we discuss the cases of the chern - simons theory in the presence of a source as well as the yang - mills theories , both in @xmath46 dimensions .",
    "an important result of this section is the quantization of the charges in the case where the two dimensional space sub - manifold has no border . in section [ sec:3 + 1 ]",
    "we discuss the interesting case of non - abelian gauge theories in @xmath47 dimensions , in the presence of matter currents .",
    "an important result here is an integral formulation of the yang - mills equations , and the construction of gauge invariant conserved charges .",
    "in the appendices [ sec : curves ] and [ sec : surface ] we give the proofs of the non - abelian stokes theorems used in our constructions .",
    "in a @xmath45 dimensional space - time @xmath9 we establish a dynamical equation relating a field @xmath48 , element of a lie group @xmath49 , to another field @xmath50 , a 1-form taking values in the lie algebra @xmath51 of @xmath49 .",
    "the relation between those two fields is built as follows .",
    "consider a path @xmath52 in @xmath9 , parametrized by @xmath53 , and define a quantity @xmath54 through the differential equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , are the cartesian coordinates in @xmath9 of the points of @xmath52 .",
    "integration of can be formally written as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 stands for the path - ordering , and @xmath60 is an integration constant corresponding to the value of @xmath54 at the initial point @xmath7 of the path @xmath52 .",
    "given any smooth path @xmath52 in @xmath9 , with initial and final points denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath61 respectively , we impose the following equation for the fields @xmath48 and @xmath50 @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 corresponding to the values of @xmath48 at the end points @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and the r.h.s . of is obtained by integrating along the path @xmath52 , assuming that the integration constant is unit .",
    "note that has the form of since the border of @xmath52 corresponds to its end points , i.e. @xmath67 , and @xmath68 stands for the integration of @xmath21 on @xmath69 , which in this case would be a zero - form .     and @xmath70 , connecting the points @xmath7 and @xmath61 , which are used to construct the conserved charges as the eigenvalues of the operator . the horizontal paths are parallel to the space axis and the vertical ones to the time axis . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "the first important consequence of is that the path ordered integral of @xmath50 is independent of the path . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath71 and @xmath72 are two paths in @xmath9 with the same end points @xmath65 and @xmath66 , then implies that @xmath73 .",
    "that fact together with some appropriate boundary conditions is a conservation law as we now explain .",
    "consider the space - time as being @xmath74 , and let @xmath75 and @xmath76 be the time and space coordinates respectively .",
    "we choose the coordinates of @xmath7 as being @xmath77 and of @xmath61 as @xmath78 , with @xmath79 being a length scale which will be taken to infinity at the end of calculations .",
    "we choose two paths joining @xmath7 and @xmath61 as shown in figure [ path_charge_1d ] , i.e. the first path is @xmath80 and the second @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath81 and @xmath82 are paths at constant time at @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively . on",
    "the other hand @xmath85 and @xmath86 are paths at constant space at @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "if one assumes that the time component of the one - form satisfies the boundary condition @xmath89 , for all values of @xmath90 , then the path ordered integrals of @xmath91 along @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the same , i.e. @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the equality of the path ordered integrals of @xmath91 along @xmath71 and @xmath72 leads to the iso - spectral evolution equation p_1e^-__tdc_(x)= u(t ) p_1e^-__0dc_(x)u(t)^-1 consequently the eigenvalues of the operator q = p_1e^-__tdc_(x)= g(t , l)g^-1(t ,-",
    "l ) where in the last equality we have used , are constant in time .",
    "similarly , one can express those constants of motion as @xmath93 , for any integer @xmath94 .",
    "when we take the limit @xmath95 , one observes that the conserved charges are determined by the asymptotic values of the field @xmath48 , which is a known result in soliton theory @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the case where the space - time is of the form @xmath96 , where the space submanifold @xmath38 has no border , like for instance the circle @xmath97 .",
    "it then follows from that the path ordered integral of @xmath91 on the whole space @xmath38 must be unity , i.e. p_1e^-_sdc_(x)= since the initial and final points are the same and so @xmath98 .",
    "that is true for any value of time , and consequently can be interpreted as a conservation law , where the conserved charges are in fact trivial .",
    "however , depending upon the theory under consideration , one gets ( topological ) quantization conditions for some quantities .",
    "a simple example would be that of an abelian pure imaginary connection , @xmath99 , where leads to @xmath100 , with @xmath101 integer .",
    "note that transforms covariantly under the gauge transformations c _",
    "hc_h^-1-_hh^-1gh g since implies that @xmath102 , with @xmath7 and @xmath61 being the end points of @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the conserved charges given by the eigenvalues of are invariant under those gauge transformations satisfying @xmath103 .    if @xmath52 is taken to be a path infinitesimally short , so that its end points approach each other , then @xmath104 at @xmath66 can be written as an approximation of the value it has at @xmath65 by using a taylor expansion : @xmath105 , with @xmath106 being the infinitesimal displacement between @xmath61 and @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the l.h.s . of , up to first order in @xmath106 , becomes @xmath107 .",
    "in addition , the path - ordering effects in the integration of @xmath91 are of higher order in @xmath106 , and therefore the r.h.s of , up to first order , becomes simply @xmath108 .",
    "since that is valid for any infinitesimal path located anywhere in the space - time @xmath9 , we get that implies the following differential equation for the fields @xmath48 and @xmath50 @xmath109 therefore @xmath91 is of the form of a pure gauge field , and consequently its curvature vanishes , i.e. _ c_-_c_+[c_,c_]=0 the relation is the so - called lax - zakharov - shabat equation @xcite or the zero curvature condition , which is the basic structure used in the development of exact methods in soliton theory and two dimensional integrable field theories .",
    "the equation is therefore an integral formulation of the lax - zakharov - shabat equation .",
    "one can in fact obtain one from the other . however , there are some subtleties in the integral formulation , since it works with the two fields @xmath91 and @xmath48 and a relation between them , namely .",
    "that approach leads in a quite natural way , as shown in , to the fact that the conserved charges come from boundary terms .",
    "such result is known for a large class of soliton theories @xcite , but it is not so certain that it holds for integrable field theories not possessing solitons . it would be interesting to investigate that issue further .",
    "in addition , the integral formulation leads to the triviality of the charges , or its topological quantization , in the case where the space sub - manifold has no border .",
    "in the case of theories defined on a @xmath2-dimensional space - time @xmath9 the basic ingredient of our construction is the so - called non - abelian stokes theorem for a one - form connection @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath14 be a two dimensional smooth surface on @xmath9 , and let @xmath110 be its border , i.e. a closed curve on @xmath9 .",
    "the theorem states that the path - ordered integral of @xmath91 around @xmath110 is equal to the surface ordered integral on @xmath14 , of the curvature of @xmath91 , i.e. p_1e^-_dc_w_r = w_rp_2e^_ddw^-1 g _ w where g_=_c_-_c_+c _ , c _ a proof of is given in the appendix [ sec : curves ] , but its meaning is the following .",
    "one chooses a reference point @xmath7 on the border of @xmath14 and scan it with closed loops starting and ending at @xmath7 .",
    "the loops are labelled by @xmath111 such that @xmath112 corresponds to the infinitesimal loop around @xmath7 , and @xmath113 corresponds to the border @xmath114 .",
    "each closed loop is parametrized by @xmath53 such that @xmath115 and @xmath116 corresponds to @xmath7 . the l.h.s .",
    "of is obtained by integrating the differential equation along @xmath114 , and @xmath60 is the integration constant corresponding to the value of @xmath54 at @xmath7 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath117 is that such integration has to be path ordered .",
    "as shown in the appendix [ sec : curves ] , the r.h.s . of",
    "is obtained by integrating on @xmath14 the differential equation @xmath118 with _ 0 ^ 2dw^-1g_w and the meaning of @xmath119 is that such integration has to be surface ordered according to the scanning of @xmath14 with loops as explained above .",
    "again @xmath60 is the integration constant and corresponds to the value of @xmath120 on the infinitesimal loop around @xmath7 .",
    "that the two integration constants have to be the same can be understood by shrinking @xmath14 to the reference point @xmath7 .",
    "we now show how to use the non - abelian stokes theorem to define an integral formulation of the chern - simons and yang - mills theories , both in the presence of sources , and on a space - time of @xmath46 dimensions .",
    "we then show how to use to construct conserved charges for those theories .",
    "consider a theory on a @xmath2-dimensional space - time @xmath9 for a vector field @xmath4 and a current @xmath121 , with @xmath122 , and let its classical equations of motion be defined as follows . on any two dimensional smooth surface @xmath14 on @xmath9 , with border @xmath114 , the fields must satisfy the integral equations @xmath123 where @xmath124 stands for the hodge dual of the matter current i.e. , @xmath125 , and where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are coupling constants of the theory .",
    "the meaning of the path ordered ( @xmath117 ) and surface ordered ( @xmath119 ) integrals in is the same as those in , i.e. the l.h.s . of is obtained by integrating with @xmath128 , and its r.h.s . by integrating with @xmath129 .",
    "since is valid on any @xmath14 , then it has to hold true when @xmath14 is taken to be an infinitesimal surface .",
    "it then follows that implies local differential equations for the fields as we now explain .",
    "indeed , take @xmath14 to be a planar surface of rectangular shape on the plane defined by two axis of the cartesian coordinates , let us say @xmath56 and @xmath130 , with @xmath131 and @xmath132 fixed .",
    "the border @xmath114 is then a rectangle of infinitesimal sides @xmath106 and @xmath133 .",
    "we evaluate both sides of by taylor expanding the integrands around one given corner of the rectangle , and keeping things at the lowest non - trivial order .",
    "one can check that the l.h.s . of becomes @xmath134 , with no sum in @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and where f_=_a_-_a_+iea _ , a _ the r.h.s . of in lowest order is given by @xmath135 ( no sum in @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) .",
    "therefore , for an infinitesimal surface , implies the local differential equations for @xmath4 f_= _ = _ j^ which are the equations of motion of the chern - simons theory in the presence of an external current @xmath121 .    on the other hand one",
    "observes that if one takes @xmath91 in as @xmath128 , and therefore @xmath136 , and uses , then one obtains .",
    "in other words , is a direct consequence of the non - abelian stokes theorem and the chern - simons equations of motion . since implies ,",
    "we see that is indeed an integral formulation of the chern - simons theory .    note that in obtaining from the non - abelian stokes theorem we have dropped the integration constant @xmath60 .",
    "that has to do with the covariance of under gauge transformations , as we now explain .",
    "the chern - simons equation transforms covariantly under the gauge transformations @xmath137 , since @xmath138 , and @xmath139 . from",
    "we have that under a gauge transformation @xmath140 , where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the values of @xmath104 at the initial and final points of the curve where @xmath54 is defined .",
    "consequently , on a closed curve one has that @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the value of @xmath104 at the reference point @xmath7 , where the curve starts and ends .",
    "in addition , @xmath145 defined in , with @xmath146 replaced by @xmath147 , transforms as @xmath148 , and so from we have that @xmath149 .",
    "however , if @xmath150 and @xmath151 are solutions of and respectively , so are @xmath152 and @xmath153 , with @xmath154 and @xmath155 constant group elements . under a gauge transformation one would then have @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , with @xmath158 .",
    "but since @xmath154 and @xmath155 are arbitrary group elements one should not expect them to depend upon @xmath4 , and so be insensitive to its gauge transformations .",
    "therefore , one could as well conclude that @xmath159 , and @xmath160 . the only way to establish a compatibility is to assume that @xmath154 and @xmath155 should belong to the center of the gauge group @xmath49 , since @xmath144 can be any element of @xmath49 .",
    "since the integration constants @xmath60 in have the same status in this discussion , as @xmath154 and @xmath155 , we have to take them to lie in the center of @xmath49 to have the gauge covariance of the integral chern - simons equation .",
    "however , when that is done they drop out from since they commute with the path and surface ordered integrals .",
    "so , when integrating and to construct the l.h.s . and r.h.s .",
    "respectively of one should keep in mind that those operators can carry an integration constant lying in the center of @xmath49 without destroying the gauge covariance of .",
    "that fact may be important in some applications .",
    "note that both sides of depend upon the choice of the reference point @xmath7 and also on the choice of the scanning of @xmath14 with loops .",
    "however , when one changes the scanning and the reference point , the non - abelian stokes theorem guarantees that both sides of change in a way that they remain equal to each other . in that sense one can say that transforms `` covariantly '' under the change of scanning and reference point . in fact , even though we have defined the equation on any surface @xmath14 in @xmath9 , it is formally defined on the loop space @xmath161 , consisting of maps from the circle @xmath162 into @xmath14 , such that the north pole of @xmath162 is mapped into @xmath7 .",
    "the images of such maps are closed loops in @xmath14 , starting and ending at @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath14 is scanned by a collection of such loops , and the loops are points in @xmath163 , one can see @xmath14 as a path in @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , a change in the scanning of @xmath14 corresponds to a change of path in @xmath163 representing the same physical @xmath14 .",
    "despite the fact that is defined on loop space , it leads to very physical consequences , like conservation laws as we now explain . consider the case where the surface @xmath14 is a closed surface @xmath164 , i.e. with no border .",
    "then , the l.h.s . of is trivial and we are lead to @xmath165 being a closed surface , @xmath164 corresponds to a closed path in the loop space @xmath166 , starting and ending at the reference point @xmath7 .",
    "consider now a point on that path corresponding to a loop @xmath52 in @xmath164 .",
    "it divide the path in two parts corresponding to two surfaces , i.e. we have @xmath167 . from the ordering defined by",
    "we have that p_2e^__1ddw^-1_wp_2e^__2ddw^-1_w= by reverting the sense of the integration along the path , one obtains the inverse operator when integrating . then , @xmath168 and @xmath169 are two surfaces corresponding to two paths starting and ending at the same points , namely the reference point @xmath7 and the loop @xmath52 , which is their common border .",
    "therefore , implies that the integration along two paths with the same end points gives the same operator . since that is valid for any closed surface @xmath164 and any partition of it into two surfaces , we conclude that the quantity @xmath170 is independent of the surface @xmath14 .",
    "it depends only on the initial and final points of the path corresponding to @xmath14 in loop space , i.e. the border @xmath110 and the reference point @xmath7 on it .",
    "note that such independency corresponds to the change of the reparameterization ( scanning ) of the surface , as well as to the change of the surface itself , but keeping the border and reference point fixed .",
    "such surface independency leads to conservation laws as we now explain .",
    "first we consider the topology of space - time to be @xmath171 , with time being the real line @xmath37 , and the space being the closed two dimensional surface with no boundary @xmath172 .",
    "a simple case is when @xmath172 is the two - sphere , i.e. @xmath173 . then if we evaluate in space ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath174 ) we get that the quantity @xmath175 , is conserved in time and equal to unity .",

    "equation does not only describes the yang - mills theory in loop space , but also leads to a conservation laws as we now discuss . for a closed path in loop space , corresponding to a closed volume @xmath348 in space - time , with no boundary , the l.h.s of equation becomes trivial and we get @xmath349 consider now a given point in that path , in space - time , the surface @xmath14 , which divides it into two parts : @xmath350 .",
    "then , we can split equation as @xmath351 each term of this equation is obtained from integration of .",
    "it can be written as @xmath352 .",

    "in other words , the integration of , for the volumes @xmath356 and @xmath357 , with the same boundary @xmath14 and reference point @xmath7 , leads to the same operator .",
    "in fact , since equation holds for any closed volume @xmath348 and for any partition of it into two other volumes , what we just saw is that not only the integration of along two volumes with same boundary gives the same operator but also that @xmath358 is independent of the volume , for any volume @xmath16 .",
    "this means that as long as the border is kept fixed , one can change the volume and there will be no consequences to @xmath359 .",
    "the fact that this operator depends only on the border @xmath18 and on the reference point @xmath65 on it , leads to conservation laws as we now explain .",
    "consider first the case in which space - time @xmath9 has the topology @xmath360 , with @xmath172 being a closed unbounded spatial submanifold and @xmath37 the time .",
    "then , equation can be evaluated for @xmath361 , giving that the quantity @xmath362 is conserved in time and is equal to the unit .",
    "this has two main implications : the first is that the net charge on the whole space vanishes , and the other is that it might lead to some quantization condition . in particular , for the case of the maxwell theory , where the ( abelian ) gauge group is @xmath176 , this equation for @xmath363 is satisfied if @xmath364 , is such that @xmath365 with @xmath101 integer .",
    "if for some reason @xmath241 can be fixed at the quantum level , then express the quantization of electric charge @xcite .",
    "next we consider the space - time @xmath9 to have the topology @xmath366 .",
    "lets take two points in the loop space , which correspond in space - time to the following two surfaces ( see figure [ path_charge_3d ] ) : the infinitesimal 2-sphere @xmath367 around @xmath65 , at time @xmath368 and the 2-sphere which is the border of the entire space at time @xmath369 ; and which we denote as @xmath370 .",
    "now , these two points in @xmath25 are joined by two different paths ( volumes in space - time ) and each of these paths are composed by two parts as we now explain .",
    "the first part of the first path is the infinitesimal hyper - cylinder @xmath371 , with @xmath200 being the interval in @xmath37 from @xmath372 to @xmath90 and @xmath367 the infinitesimal sphere around @xmath65 .",
    "the second part of this path is the volume inside the sphere @xmath370 , which we make by `` blowing up '' the infinitesimal sphere @xmath367 when we reach the point @xmath369 ; we denote this volume by @xmath373 .",
    "this first path is then the composition @xmath374 .",
    "the second path has a first part , which in space - time corresponds to the whole spatial volume @xmath375 , inside @xmath376 at @xmath368 , and its second part is the hyper - cylinder @xmath377 .",
    "this path is the composition @xmath378 .",
    "basically we are dealing with different paths ( volumes ) which boundaries - @xmath367 and @xmath379 - are common , and thus , following our previous result , the operator @xmath380 , is independent of the volume , and should depend only on the boundaries of @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , it follows that @xmath381 , and this can be written as @xmath382    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    of the `` path '' used in the construction of the conserved charge .",
    "[ path_charge_3d ]    in order to obtain @xmath359 for each step it is necessary to evaluate @xmath383 on the surfaces scanning each volume @xmath16 .",
    "we shall scan a hyper - cylinder @xmath384 with surfaces , based at @xmath7 , of the form given in figure ( 5.b ) , with @xmath209 denoting a time in the interval @xmath200 .",
    "each one of such surfaces are scanned with loops , labelled by @xmath111 , in the following way . for @xmath385 , we scan the infinitesimal cylinder as shown in figure ( 5.a ) , then for @xmath386 we scan the sphere @xmath256 as shown in figure ( 5.b ) , and finally for @xmath387 we go back to @xmath7 with loops as shown in figure ( 5.c )",
    ". then , we can split @xmath335 in three parts : @xmath388 , each of them corresponding to one of the three surfaces , defined by the @xmath111 intervals .    from the physical point of view",
    "it is very reasonable to take the current and the field strength to satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath389 for @xmath390 , with @xmath271 and @xmath391 bigger than zero . with that , integration of @xmath145 over @xmath392 vanishes and we get @xmath393 for the path @xmath353 .",
    "we notice that for the path @xmath356 , the infinitesimal sphere @xmath367 does not contribute to @xmath394 , and we have also @xmath393 in this case .",
    "then we conclude that @xmath335 calculated in both spheres @xmath392 and @xmath367 gives the same result and therefore @xmath395 it is now possible to contract the cylinders into a line , so that the loops scanning them in the intervals @xmath396 $ ] and @xmath397 $ ] become exactly the same .",
    "however , since one set of loops is `` going up '' , and the other is `` going down '' ( the sign of the velocity @xmath398 changes ) , the contributions @xmath399 and @xmath400 exactly cancel . note that @xmath120 inside @xmath335 , obtained from does not change sign since it does not see the direction the loops are going to but only takes into account the profile of the loop for each @xmath111 .",
    "finally what remains is exactly @xmath120 calculated on @xmath373 , whose border is the sphere @xmath379 , where we need to evaluate @xmath335 . in order to scan the sphere",
    ", we establish the point @xmath401 , on its boundary .",
    "this is the point @xmath65 at time @xmath369 , so that the path starts at @xmath65 , goes up to @xmath401 , and from this point we scan the sphere with loops .",
    "then , we go back to @xmath65 .",
    "so , we construct the wilson line composed of the two parts : @xmath402 the one corresponding to the `` leg '' that goes up from @xmath65 to @xmath401 , denoted by @xmath403 , and the one that corresponds to the path from @xmath401 to the point @xmath404 , on the sphere . using this decomposition we can re - write every needed quantity in terms of the new reference point @xmath401 .",
    "in particular , @xmath268 in equation is decomposed as @xmath405 .",
    "this leads to @xmath406 ; in the same way the quantities @xmath394 and @xmath145 transform as @xmath407 and @xmath408 , so that @xmath359 obtained from becomes @xmath409 plugging this into the equation we finally get @xmath410 with @xmath411 .",
    "therefore , the operator @xmath412 has an iso - spectral evolution in time , and thus , its eigenvalues , or equivalently @xmath413 , are conserved in time .",
    "using yang - mills integral equation one can write @xmath414 as a volume or a surface ordered integral : @xmath415    the fact that this operator is independent of the parameterization of the volume guarantees that the conserved charges constructed from it are also independent of this parametrization .",
    "one can , however , argue about the dependence of our results with respect to the choice of the reference point . as we saw above , by changing @xmath401 to @xmath416 , @xmath417 changes under conjugation with respect to @xmath418 , and",
    "so its eigenvalues ( conserved charges ) are invariant under change of reference point .",
    "in addition , the reference point is placed at the border of @xmath419 ( the spatial infinity ) , and the field strength is supposed to vanish there , which implies that the gauge field @xmath4 is asymptotically flat , and therefore the wilson line depends only on the points and not on the path joining them .",
    "the conserved charges are also gauge invariant , since under a gauge transformation we have seen that @xmath420 , with @xmath144 being the group element , performing the gauge transformation , at @xmath229 .",
    "note in addition that if @xmath421 has an iso - spectral evolution so does @xmath422 , with @xmath423 and element of the centre @xmath344 of the gauge group @xmath49 .",
    "that fact has to do with the freedom we have to choose the integration constants to lie in @xmath344 , without spoiling the gauge covariance of .",
    "note that there are several integral and loop space formulations of yang - mills theories @xcite .",
    "our approach shares some of the ideas of those formulations in the sense of using ordered integrals of the gauge potential and of the field strength tensor .",
    "however , it differs in an essential way because it is based on the new eq . .",
    "in addition , it leads in a quite novel and direct way to gauge invariant conserved charges .      consider a theory where the gauge group @xmath49 is spontaneously broken into a higgs field in the adjoint representation . consider a bps dyon solution : @xmath424 with @xmath425 an arbitrary constant angle .    at spatial infinity ( @xmath426 , @xmath427 ) , we have @xmath428 where @xmath429 is an element of the lie algebra of @xmath430 , covariantly constant @xmath431@xcite .",
    "also , the field strength goes to zero there , which leads to a asymptotically flat gauge field @xmath432 and therefore , at @xmath433 we get @xmath434 where @xmath435 stands for the value of @xmath429 at @xmath65 .",
    "then , the operator @xmath359 discussed previously becomes @xmath436 \\frac{dx^{\\mu}}{d\\sigma}\\frac{dx^{\\nu}}{d\\tau}}=e^{\\left[-ie(\\alpha\\,\\cos \\theta+\\beta\\,\\sin\\theta)g_r\\right]}\\ ] ] and the conserved charges are given by the eigenvalues of @xmath435 , which contain the magnetic and electric charges of the dyon solution .",
    "it is important to remark that since @xmath435 is at spatial infinity , according to our observations a change of the reference point makes it change by conjugation with the wilson line of the path between the new point and the old one ; this changes nothing in the eigenvalues of @xmath435 .",
