    "this note is on inverse spectral theory for the schrdinger operator on a flat two - dimensional torus with electric and magnetic potentials",
    ". this problem can be remarkably rigid . for generic flat tori ,",
    "if the variation of the magnetic field is strictly less than its mean , and the total magnetic flux on the torus is @xmath0 , then the spectrum of the schrdinger operator determines both the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this is in marked contrast to both the schrdinger operator without a magnetic field ( see [ 3 ] ) and the case of a magnetic field of mean zero ( see [ 1 ] ) . in both those problems",
    "there are large families of isospectral fields , and rigidity results are much more difficult to obtain ( see also [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the observation that there can be spectral rigidity when the total flux is @xmath0 is due to guillemin ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "here we give a short proof of the slightly stronger result stated above . instead of thinking of the hamiltonian as acting on functions with values in a line bundle over the torus @xmath1 ,",
    "we think of the hamiltonian as acting on functions on @xmath2 which are invariant with respect to the magnetic translations \" associated to @xmath3 . however , these two settings are completely equivalent .",
    "our assumption that the variation of the magnetic field @xmath4 is strictly less than its mean @xmath5 takes the simple form @xmath6 for all @xmath7 .",
    "the spectrum of the laplacian plus lower order perturbations on flat tori has the feature that there are large families of spectral invariants corresponding to sets of geodesics with a fixed length . in analogy with results on @xmath8 guillemin proposed the name band invariants \" for these families .",
    "the nice feature of the problem discussed here is that only the simplest of the band invariants are needed to prove rigidity .",
    "the first complete solution of an inverse spectral problem was mark krein s definitive analysis of the weighted string \" , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] . since that time many other inverse spectral problems in one space dimension",
    "have been solved ( see [ 11 ] ) . in higher dimensions",
    "it is widely believed that , modulo natural symmetries and deformations like gauge transformation , most problems will be spectrally rigid",
    ". however , so far there have been relatively few settings where this has been proven ( for instance those in [ 6 ] and [ 14 ] ) and many interesting examples where it fails ( see [ 12 ] and [ 4 ] ) .",
    "this should remain an active field of research for many years to come , and one can reasonably say that it began with the work of mark grigorevich krein .",
    ".2 in we begin with the smooth magnetic field @xmath9 , periodic with respect to the lattice @xmath3 in two dimensions , expanded in a fourier series in terms of the dual lattice @xmath10",
    "@xmath11 for this magnetic field we introduce the magnetic potential @xmath12 with @xmath13 , chosen to be as periodic as possible , i.e. @xmath14 we also have a mean zero periodic electric field which is the gradient of the mean zero periodic potential @xmath15 the quantum hamiltonian for an electron in these fields ( with all physical constants set to 1 ) is @xmath16 .1 in let @xmath17 be a fundamental domain for @xmath3 . to define the domain of @xmath18 as an operator in @xmath19 we will use magnetic translation operators \" ( see [ 13 ] ) .",
    "letting @xmath20 and @xmath21 be a basis for @xmath3 and the corresponding dual basis for @xmath10 , define for linearly independent vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 then the commutator @xmath25 $ ] is given by @xmath26u(x)=(e^{iv_2\\cdot e_1}-e^{iv_1\\cdot e_2})e^{i(v_1+v_2)\\cdot x}u(x+e_1+e_2),\\ ] ] and the periodicity of @xmath27 and @xmath28 implies that the commutator @xmath29 $ ] is given by @xmath30u(x)=e^{iv_j\\cdot x}((i\\partial_x+a(x)+a^0(e_j))^2-(i\\partial_x+a(x)-v_j)^2)u(x+e_j).\\ ] ] thus , in order for the @xmath31 s to commute with @xmath18 we require @xmath32 , and in order for the @xmath31 s to commute with each other we require @xmath33 for some integer @xmath34 .",
    "note that this implies @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the total magnetic flux .",
    "hence the assumption @xmath39 is equivalent to nonzero flux , and it implies @xmath40 . defining the domain of @xmath18 to be the subspace of @xmath41 such that @xmath42 , we make @xmath18 a self - adjoint operator in @xmath19 . .1 in as in many previous works we will look for spectral invariants for @xmath18 by studying the wave trace .",
    "letting @xmath43 be the distribution kernel for the fundamental solution for the initial value problem @xmath44 the distribution kernel for the corresponding initial value problem in @xmath45 is @xmath46 where the operators @xmath31 act on the @xmath7 variable .",
    "note that , since the principal part of @xmath47 is @xmath48 , @xmath49 when @xmath50 and the sum in is has only a finite number of nonzero terms for @xmath51 in a bounded interval .",
    "thus @xmath25=0 $ ] implies @xmath52 .",
    "the fundamental spectral invariant for this problem is the distribution trace of the operator @xmath53 corresponding to the kernel @xmath54 .",
    "conventionally ( with all terms to be interpreted in distribution sense ) this is written @xmath55 .1 in to avoid degeneracies in the contributions to @xmath56 from the terms in ( 1 ) , we assume that vectors in @xmath3 have distinct lengths , i.e. @xmath57 since @xmath43 is singular as a distribution in @xmath58 only when @xmath59 , it now follows that the singularity of @xmath56 at @xmath60 comes from just two terms @xmath61dx .",
    "% \\eqno{(2)}\\ ] ] to determine the spectral invariants coming from the leading terms in the expansion of this singularity it is convenient to use the hadamard - hrmander expansion [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] for @xmath43 .",
    "beginning with the forward fundamental solution , @xmath62 , defined by @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 one has @xmath66 where @xmath67 is chosen so that @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the forward fundamental solution for @xmath48 . in two space dimensions",
    "this means @xmath71 for @xmath72 , @xmath73 for @xmath65 .",
    "for @xmath74 the distribution @xmath75 is defined by @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "hence the coefficients @xmath80 are determined by the recursion @xmath81 where @xmath18 acts in the variable @xmath7 . solving this with the requirement that @xmath82 , we have        where @xmath85 is determined by @xmath86 . the fundamental solution @xmath43 is given by @xmath87 .1 in",
    "we define @xmath88 and @xmath89e^{i(2a^0(x)\\cdot   d-\\int_0 ^ 1d\\cdot a^1(x+sd)ds)}dx.\\ ] ] from - one sees that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are spectral invariants for @xmath18 .",
    "however , the periodicity implies that @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    ".1 in the rest of this article is devoted to studying @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we have @xmath96 , @xmath97 and gcd(@xmath98)=1 .",
    "let @xmath99 .",
    "then we have @xmath100 since @xmath101 when @xmath102 , the terms in the fourier series for @xmath27 which contribute to @xmath94 have @xmath103 , and this implies @xmath104 hence , @xmath105 , and @xmath94 reduces to @xmath106 defining @xmath107 ( note that @xmath108 ) , we have @xmath109 extending @xmath110 to a basis for @xmath111 , and letting @xmath112 be the dual basis for @xmath3 , we make the change of variables @xmath113 , and choose @xmath114 then we have @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the jacobian factor , and only depends on @xmath117 . since we have this spectral invariant for all @xmath118 , it follows that @xmath119 is a spectral invariant for any function @xmath120 which can be expanded in terms of @xmath121 , i.e. for any @xmath122 which has period @xmath123 .          since @xmath128 ,",
    "the hypotheses imply that the derivative of @xmath129 is strictly positive and the inverse function @xmath130 to @xmath131 is defined on the range of @xmath132 for @xmath133 $ ] . since @xmath134 has period 1 , the range is @xmath135 $ ] .",
    "letting @xmath120 in tend to the @xmath110-function at @xmath136 , the limit of is @xmath137 if @xmath138 for @xmath133 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath139 for @xmath133 $ ] then the limit of is @xmath140 , where @xmath141 , and @xmath142 . in other words taking these limits",
    "we recover a function of period 1 in @xmath136 which agrees with @xmath137 on @xmath143 .",
    "thus we recover @xmath144 modulo an additive constant , and we obtain @xmath145 by taking the derivative . since we can carry out this argument for all prime elements @xmath146 , we recover the full fourier expansion of @xmath9 .",
    "we now turn to the recovery of @xmath28 .",
    "the preceding analysis shows that , keeping the same @xmath147 as above , the spectral invariant @xmath95 , modulo terms determined by @xmath86 , reduces to @xmath148 where @xmath149 this immediately gives the following :      since we are assuming the hypotheses of theorem  [ theo:2.1 ] , we have the function @xmath130 and can make the substitution @xmath150 in . that gives @xmath151 but , since @xmath152",
    ", we can extend @xmath130 smoothly to the whole line by defining @xmath153 .",
    "thus , since @xmath154 has period 1 in @xmath155 , we have @xmath156 since we have this spectral invariant for @xmath157 , we recover the fourier series of @xmath158 , and , hence , since @xmath130 is determined by @xmath159 , we have @xmath154 . as before , since we can carry out this argument for all prime elements @xmath146 , we recover the full fourier expansion of @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath160 , for the lattice @xmath3 , then @xmath124 for the lattice @xmath161 generated by @xmath162 and @xmath163 when @xmath164 .",
    "so if @xmath4 and @xmath165 are periodic with respect to @xmath161 , theorems 1 and 2 apply in the sense that the spectrum of @xmath18 on the torus @xmath166 determines @xmath4 and @xmath165 .",
