    "constituent quark models ( cqm ) provide a basic tool for the description of low - energy hadron phenomena .",
    "important features of non - perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) can be incorporated in the cqm providing a framework for quantitative calculations of hadron properties and reaction observables . in particular cqm",
    "can be made to incorporate some of the basic symmetries @xcite of qcd and , at the same time , can be defined within relativistic frameworks where covariance is preserved @xcite .",
    "gluons and quark - antiquark pairs surrounding a current quark are considered an integral part of it and together they make the constituent quark : a picture which seems to be substantiated by recent lattice qcd results @xcite .",
    "once explicit gluon degrees of freedom are integrated out , spin - dependent forces emerge within a potential description .",
    "such forces between quarks have been associated to the chromomagnetic interaction of one - gluon exchange ( oge ) @xcite , to goldstone - boson exchange ( gbe ) in connection with the breaking of chiral symmetry @xcite , and to the effects of instantons @xcite . at present",
    "all three models seem to have enough flexibility to approximate , to a large extent , existing data and the question whether they are just different ways of describing the same thing , remains unanswered .",
    "actually the debate on the `` defects '' of the oge as well as of the gbe is particularly active @xcite .",
    "the investigation has been mainly confined to low - energy hadron excitation spectrum @xcite and to the electroweak form factors of the nucleon @xcite . in the present work",
    "we want to enlarge considerably the front of a possible comparison between the oge and the gbe dynamical mechanisms considering the effects of the spin - dependent forces on the nucleon deep inelastic responses ( structure functions ) .    despite the fact that the subject has a rather long story",
    ", we can show that only at present we have the necessary tools to address the problem in a simple and transparent way and to elucidate the important role of spin - dependent forces on parton distributions .",
    "let us begin summarizing existing approaches .",
    "f.e . close in 1973 @xcite discussed the sensitivity of the ratio @xmath1 in relation with spin - dependent forces .",
    "he used a model of the nucleon where the nucleon first breaks up into a quark ( which then interacts with the electromagnetic field ) and a `` quasi '' particle called core . the core can have spin 0 or 1 and these two components have equal probability in a @xmath0 symmetric model only ( where spin - dependent forces are neglected ) .",
    "he concluded that the predictions for the ratio @xmath1 are related to the high - momentum behaviour of the proton-@xmath2 transition form factors .",
    "carlitz @xcite investigated the @xmath0 symmetry breaking effects in deep inelastic scattering concluding that the mass difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 states of the baryons implies that the ratio @xmath1 should approach 1/4 as @xmath4 . in a more recent work close and thomas @xcite related the @xmath2-n mass difference , to the ratio of neutron and proton inelastic structure functions and to deep inelastic polarization asymmetries .",
    "nathan isgur @xcite in a quite recent paper investigates the hyperfine - perturbed quark model to make predictions for the nucleon spin - dependent distribution functions and shows that precise measurements of the asymmetries @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( in the valence region ) can test the model and verify the `` normal '' behaviour of the valence - quark spin distribution at variance with the ( sometimes ) invoked `` spin crisis '' . in the same paper isgur",
    "critically discusses the history of the @xmath0-breaking effects with particular emphasis on the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "in fact both papers of close and carlitz and thomas studied the behaviour of the spin 1 ( @xmath7 ) and zero ( @xmath8 ) pair wave - functions separately ; an approximated scheme which is not consistent with the pauli principle unless @xmath7 and @xmath8 have very special properties under the permutation group in three dimensions .",
    "isgur concludes that the situation remains rather unclear also because most authors have attempted `` absolute '' calculations of the structure functions with the unavoidable need of assumptions , approximations and `` procedures '' . a criticism which involves also other calculations @xcite .",
    "aim of the present paper is a close investigation of the relation between the @xmath0-breaking effects , responsible for the @xmath2-n mass splitting and the charge radius of the neutron , and the ratio @xmath1 . in our approach",
    "the pauli principle is fully satisfied and we can compare effects of spin - dependent forces originating from both : chromomagnetic ( hyperfine ) oge interaction and chiral symmetry motivated gbe mechanism .",
    "because of the large debate on the subject , this last result is probably the most motivating one , and we show that the pauli principle effect reveals to be of crucial importance in the discussion .",
    "let us introduce the method we use to calculate the proton and neutron structure functions and its quite natural connection with the nucleon wave - function built in a given quark model .",
    "the work by glck , reya and coworkers @xcite has shown that , starting from a parton parametrization at a low resolution scale @xmath9 , the experimental deep inelastic structure functions at high - momentum transfer can be reproduced and even predicted @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 is evaluated by evolving back the second moment of the valence distribution to the point where it becomes dominant .",
    "the procedure , closely related to a suggestion due to parisi and petronzio @xcite , assumes that there exists a scale , @xmath9 , where the short range ( perturbative ) part of the interaction is negligible , therefore the glue and sea are suppressed , and the long range ( confining ) part of the interaction produces a proton composed of three ( valence ) quarks only .",
    "jaffe and ross @xcite proposed thereafter to ascribe the quark model calculations of matrix elements to the hadronic scale @xmath9 . for larger @xmath10",
    "their wilson coefficients will give the evolution as dictated by perturbative qcd .",
    "in this way quark models , summarizing a great deal of hadronic properties , may substitute low - energy parametrizations .",
    "following such a path , a partonic description can be generated from gluon radiation even off a pure valence quark system , which can be used to evaluate the non - perturbative input occurring in the operator product expansion ( ope ) analysis of lepton - hadron scattering in qcd @xcite .",
    "a systematic analysis shows that the approach can consistently be developed at next - to - leading order both for polarized and unpolarized structure functions , including non - perturbative contributions from the nucleon cloud @xcite or from the partonic substructure of the constituent quarks@xcite .",
    "in addition it can consistently be improved including relativistic covariance effects within the light - front hamiltonian dynamics @xcite .    in the light - front description of deep inelastic scattering",
    ", the parton model is recovered , in the bjorken limit , due to the dominance of short light - cone distances in the relevant feynmann diagrams . as a consequence",
    "the partonic description can be developed in the rest frame of the hadron by using light - cone formalism .",
    "in particular the @xmath11-th parton distribution can be related to the light - cone momentum density ) can be found in the paper by mair and traini in ref.@xcite . ]",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the light - cone momentum fraction of the struck parton in the rest frame , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the nucleon and parton mass respectively and @xmath16 , @xmath17 represent the light - cone momentum density of the @xmath11-th parton whose spin is _ aligned _ ( @xmath18 ) or _ anti - aligned _ ( @xmath19 ) to the total spin of the parent nucleon . if one assumes that at the scale @xmath9 only the @xmath20 and @xmath21 constituent quarks are resolved , the momentum densities can be written @xmath22 the light - cone distributions ( [ n_up / down ] ) can be evaluated including relativistic effects as introduced by a light - front formulation of a three - body interacting system @xcite . as a consequence we remain within a constituent picture where the partons in the rest frame are identified with three ( constituent ) quarks at the hadronic scale , and covariance requirement as well as pauli principle are fulfilled .    since the hadronic scale @xmath9 turns out to be very low ( @xmath23 gev@xmath24 ) , close to the constituent quark mass ranges from 0.1 gev@xmath24 , if only valence quarks are considered , to 0.37 gev@xmath25 , when non - perturbative @xmath26 pairs and gluons are included . ] , we assume that the constituent picture at this scale is represented by a constituent quark model , with parameters fixed to reproduce the basic features of the nucleon spectrum in the energy region @xmath27 gev . the constituent quark models",
    "we will make use of , in the present paper , are the isgur - karl model ( ik ) proposed long ago @xcite and the gbe recently developed @xcite .",
    "in particular the unpolarized valence parton distributions @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 ) , at the hadronic scale are related to the scalar momentum densities @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 ) calculated making use of the wave - functions of the ik or gbe models with no free parameters .",
    "the dynamical effects due to the @xmath0-breaking terms in the quark hamiltonian are entirely embedded in the momentum densities and no approximation is required .",
    "details of the approach can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the results for the ( twist - two part of ) proton and neutron structure functions predicted by the two models , are shown in figs .  1 both at the hadronic scale and experimental scale @xmath32 gev@xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath33-dependence of the ik and gbe models differs quite substantially in the large @xmath33-region both at the hadronic and at the experimental scale .",
    "in particular the ik model lacks high-@xmath33 components : a result related to the lack of high - momentum components in the nucleon wave - function .",
    "the relativized nature of the gbe hamiltonian reflects into a larger component of high momenta in the corresponding densities , an important ingredient to reproduce the behaviour of the structure functions at high-@xmath33 related to the presence of the @xmath34 term in the hamiltonian and therefore manifested in all the relativized models .    before entering the discussion",
    "let us notice that the expected results for @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be separated in two main regions .",
    "the low-@xmath33 ( @xmath37 ) region will be dominated by gluonic and sea partons . in the present calculation",
    "they are generated via bremsstrahlung radiation through renormalization group evolution .",
    "it is well known@xcite that the inclusion of these hard partons is not sufficient to explain the absolute values of the structure functions at low-@xmath33 and soft components have to be added at the hadronic scale to approach the data .",
    "therefore we do not consider our calculation to be quantitative for that region . at",
    "most we will obtain a qualitative description of the two structure functions .    in the region of large-@xmath33 ( @xmath38 ) the structure functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are dominated by valence parton effects which are sensitive to the quark model wave - functions .",
    "it is just that region where the results for the ratio @xmath1 can become a specific test for the model wave - functions .",
    "our main results are presented in figs .  2 , and a few comments are in order :    \\i ) despite of the large sea and gluon contributions produced by qcd evolution ( as illustrated in the figs .  1",
    "a and 1  b ) the ratio @xmath1 is scarcely influenced by the perturbative qcd radiative effects , as expected .",
    "@xmath39 for the whole range @xmath40 .",
    "such insensitivity is , in our case , an advantage .",
    "in fact the effects of qcd evolution largely cancel in the ratio @xmath1 compensating also the uncertainties coming from an evolution which starts from a quite low hadronic scale . as a result ,",
    "the details connected with the model wave - functions are emphasized ( see figs .",
    "2  a,2  b ) .",
    "\\ii ) in particular it is evident that the leading order and the next - to - leading order results do not differ appreciably .",
    "\\iii ) the ratio @xmath1 differs from the value 2/3 , the asymptotic value for @xmath0-symmetric models , because of the presence of spin - dependent forces in the model hamiltonian .",
    "\\iv ) both the chromomagnetic ( hyperfine ) interaction of the ik model and the chiral mechanism of the gbe model fail to reproduce the correct behaviour of the experimental data in the region of validity of our calculation , namely @xmath40 . a conclusion already known in the case of the ik model @xcite , but valid also for the gbe model .",
    "note that this discrepancy is highly significant , since it concerns the region of bjorken-@xmath33 where valence quarks dominate .",
    "therefore complications arising from sea and gluon contributions can not affect these results .",
    "\\v ) the effects of the large amount of high - momentum components generated by the relativistic expression of the kinetic energy can be noticed in the case of the gbe model , where the deviation with respect to the @xmath0-symmetric value 2/3 is shifted at higher value of @xmath33 .",
    "similar effects are found in a calculation @xcite which makes use of the relativized extension of the ik model proposed by isgur and capstick@xcite .",
    "\\vi ) it should be stressed that the disagreement emerges only if the pauli principle effects are properly included . a simple model of the scattering involving separately the effects from an active quark plus a core of spin 1 and 0 quark pairs ,",
    "would naturally reproduce the decreasing behaviour of the ratio @xmath1 as function of @xmath33@xcite .",
    "\\vii ) the disagreement with the experimental data does not depend on the details of the wave - function , but on the specific form of the @xmath0 breaking terms introduced in the model hamiltonian .",
    "they are quite similar in the case of gbe and oge models@xcite despite of the different dynamical mechanisms invoked .    in conclusion , by means of a direct and transparent light - front calculation",
    ", we have shown that the ratio between the neutron and the proton structure functions is sensitive to the spin - dependent part of the quark - model hamiltonian describing @xmath0-breaking effects at low hadronic energy .",
    "the correct theoretical behaviour of the ratio can be obtained only if the pauli principle is preserved in the explicit calculation of the structure functions .",
    "both hyperfine interactions , from the one - gluon - exchange potential model and from the spin dependent part of the goldstone - boson interaction , can not reproduce the large-@xmath33 behaviour of the data even at the qualitative level .",
    "the @xmath0-breaking mechanism seen in deep inelastic scattering seems to be different from the dynamical effects at low - energy , at least in the two cases we studied .",
    "previous studies of unpolarized structure functions @xcite show that a model able to invert the tendency of a ratio larger than 2/3 in the large-@xmath33 region is the algebraic model proposed by iachello @xcite . despite the fact that the model is built in such a way that only the symmetry properties are retained and",
    "no dynamical mechanisms can be deduced , the parametrization which emerges is consistent with the data , in particular if the structure of the ( effective ) constituent quark is taken into account @xcite .",
    "work to include the instanton dynamics and to enlarge the study of @xmath0 breaking effects into the region of polarized parton distributions is in progress .",
