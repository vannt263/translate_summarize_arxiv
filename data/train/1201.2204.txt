    "the high cadence and large field of view ( fov ) of these imaging observations have greatly enhanced our understanding of these solar eruptions .",
    "however , imaging observations only allow us to study the plane of sky ( pos ) component of the kinematics , which is usually a good approximation of the full kinematics only for limb events . for earth - directed eruptions , especially halo - cmes which are the cause of most strong geomagnetic storms ,",
    "imaging instruments placed close to the sun - earth line often fail to observe their initial or complete evolution .",
    "spectroscopic observations , on the other hand , can provide information on the plasma motions in the line of sight ( los ) direction and thus are critical for us to understand the kinematics of earth - directed eruptions .",
    "for both disk and limb eruptions , their three - dimensional ( 3-d ) evolution can in principle be revealed through simultaneous imaging and spectroscopic observations .",
    "in addition , spectra of different emission lines can be used to diagnose plasma properties such as electron density and temperature .",
    "spectroscopic data can also be used to estimate the mass of the erupted material and mass loss in the dimming region .",

    "however , a preliminary study of @xcite suggests that some line profiles in the dimming regions are asymmetric , with a weak enhancement in the blue wings .",
    "eis observations have also revealed an obvious increase of the line broadening in dimming regions , which was interpreted as a growth of alfvn wave amplitude or inhomogeneities of flow velocities along the los @xcite .",
    "the presence of asymmetric line profiles suggests that there are probably two emission components and that a single gaussian fit may not reveal the real physics in dimming regions @xcite .",
    "the outflow speed derived from a single gaussian fit is roughly in the range of 10 - 40  km  s@xmath1 and usually it does not change significantly for coronal emission lines formed at different temperatures @xcite .",

    "there have been a few investigations of the plasma properties of dimmings and euv jets . @xcite and @xcite used the si  347.40  &  356.04 line pairs to diagnose the electron density and found that it decreased as dimming occurred . using some assumptions of the emitting volume and the distribution of the amount of material at different temperatures",
    ", they also made an effort to estimate the mass loss in the dimming region and found that it is of the same order as the mass of the associated cmes .",
    "taking values of the formation heights of different emission lines and the densities from static solar atmosphere models , @xcite also developed a method to estimate the mass losses in dimming regions associated with two events during 2006 dec 13 - 15 . using the fe  186.88  &  195.12 line pair , @xcite measured electron densities higher than log ( _ _ @xmath2/@xmath3)=11 for an euv jet .",
    "however , they only simply summed up the spectral intensities in the wavelength windows of the lines and could not separate the blueshifted component from the background emission component .",
    "besides dimmings and ejecta associated with cmes and euv jets , other solar eruption related phenomena such as flare induced chromospheric evaporation @xcite , flare - related magnetic reconnection @xcite , filament oscillations @xcite and coronal waves @xcite have also been investigated through euv spectroscopic observations . as the approaching of the new solar maximum , there is no doubt that more spectroscopic observations will be employed to study solar eruptions since the high - resolution eis instrument is still in good condition and the interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ) is expected to be launched in 2012 .    in this paper",
    "we analyze several data sets obtained by eis during cme eruptions and euv jets .",
    "the shapes of the eis spectral line profiles suggest that the emission often consists of at least two components so that previous results based on a single gaussian fit may need to be reconsidered .",
    "we apply the recently improved techniques of red - blue ( rb ) asymmetry analysis and rb - guided double gaussian fit @xcite , which we used previously to study properties of the high - speed outflows in non - eruptive active regions ( ars ) , to the spectra acquired during solar eruptions .",
    "we find various types of flows and discuss possible mechanisms to produce these flows .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are several density sensitive line pairs used in the first ( 15:11 - 16:01 ) and last scans ( 10:29 - 11:19 ) of the 2006 dec 14 - 15 observation .",
    "thus , we can compare the densities of the dimming region with pre - eruption densities .",
    "line pairs fe  186.88  &  195.12 and fe  203.82  &  202.04 were chosen for the density diagnostics .",
    "fe  186.88 is actually a self blends of two fe   lines ( 186.85 , 186.88 ) and the fe  195.12 line is blended with fe  195.18 @xcite .",
    "the s  186.84 line usually contributes no more than 5% of the fe  186.88 feature and thus was ignored in our calculation @xcite .",
    "fe  203.82 line is a self blends of two fe   lines ( 203.79 , 203.82 ) .",
    "we calculated the line ratios and the associated standard deviations in the obvious dimming region ( defined as the region with an intensity reduction larger than 20% ) of the last scan and in the corresponding region of the first scan .",
    "the theoretical relationships between the line ratios and densities , as extracted from chianti database @xcite , are presented in figure  fig.17 .",
    "the measured values before the eruption and during dimming are indicated by the solid diamonds and squares respectively .",
    "we can see that the average density changes from log ( _ n_@xmath4/@xmath3)=8.89 to log ( _ n_@xmath4/@xmath3)=8.67 at log ( _ t_/k)=6.1 , and from log ( _ n_@xmath4/@xmath3)=8.70 to log ( _ n_@xmath4/@xmath3)=8.58 at log ( _ t_/k)=6.2 .",
    "this density decrease , together with the fact that the dimming is seen at all temperatures , strongly suggests that the dimming is an effect of density decrease rather than temperature change .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we have attempted to estimate the mass losses in several well - observed dimming regions by using two different methods .",
    "the first method is just to multiply the density change and the emission volume , which is similar to the si   method used by @xcite .",
    "the calculation process can be expressed as following :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the total mass loss , change of the number density , area of the dimming region , depth of the dimming region and proton mass , respectively .",
    "the density change @xmath7 can be calculated from the line pair fe  186.88  &  195.12 , or estimated from the intensity change of fe  195.12 if the other line was not used in the scan of dimming .",
    "the use of the fe  195.12 line seems to be reasonable since from figure  fig.16 we can see that the most significant decrease as well as the dem peak occur around log ( _ t_/k)=6.1 .",
    "the dimming area @xmath8 is defined as the total area where the fe  195.12 intensity drops more than 20% , multiplied by the ratio of the total dimming area in simultaneous full - disk coronal images ( eit or aia observations ) and the dimming area observed by eis .",
    "assuming that the emission volume is as deep as it is wide , the depth of the dimming region can be calculated as @xmath11 . as mentioned by @xcite ,",
    "the mass calculated from this method should be considered to be a reasonable figure for a comparison with the mass of the associated cme , although the fe  186.88  &  195.12 line pair can only detect density changes at a temperature of around log ( _ t_/k)=6.1 .",
    "the second method is similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "we take the emission heights of tr lines from the val3c model @xcite and coronal lines from @xcite , then calculate the densities at these heights from an empirical relationship between height and density @xcite . any density sensitive line pairs available in eis observations",
    "are then used to derived the densities , which are then compared with and scale the model densities .",
    "density changes at different heights can then be derived from intensity changes of corresponding eis lines .",
    "the total mass loss is then expressed by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the density change and dimming area respectively at the emission height of the _ i_th line .",
    "the mass losses calculated from the two methods for several well - observed dimming events are listed in table  table2 .",
    "it can be seen that the mass losses estimated from different methods are 20%-60% of the cme mass calculated from lasco white light data @xcite .",
    "such results indicate that a significant part of the cme mass originates from the dimming region .",
    "thus , in principle the values of mass loss estimated from spectroscopic observations can be used to guide our identifications of cme / icme sources .",
    "we have to mention that no strong tr lines were used in the 2011 jun 21 observation so that the mass loss derived from the second method is likely to be underestimated .",
    "we think that the difference of the dem curves before and during the dimming , as shown in figure  fig.16 , can in principle be used to derive the mass loss of the dimming region .",
    "however , it seems that we still have to make several assumptions for the dimming depth as well as the changes of density and temperature gradient , which are hard to evaluate .",
    "thus , we do not make an effort in this direction and leave it open for future investigations .",
    "@xcite made an effort to calculate the mass flux for the outflows in dimming regions and concluded that the total ejected mass is about one order of magnitude larger than the cme mass .",
    "the flow velocities they used were derived from a single gaussian fit to line profiles in dimming regions and they are of the order of @xmath020  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the density values were taken from static solar atmosphere models .",
    "if we assume that the mass refilling the corona comes from the high - speed outflows , we should expect to see an equivalence of the total mass supplied by the outflow and the mass loss in the corresponding dimming region .",
    "if we simply estimate the total mass supplied by the outflow as the product of mass flux density , area ( @xmath8 ) and duration ( @xmath15 ) of the dimming , we can have the following relationship :    @xmath16    from eit or aia observations , we roughly estimated the duration of significant dimming as 14 , 14 and 10 hours for the 2006 dec 14 , 2006 dec 13 and 2011 jun 21 events , respectively . if we take a value of 100  km  s@xmath1 for the speed ( @xmath17 ) , the density ( @xmath18 ) of the outflow can then be calculated from equation  equation4 .",
    "the calculated densities of the outflows are listed in table  table2 .",
    "these values are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the pre - eruption densities at log ( _ t_/k)=6.1 and should only be regarded as the lower limits since some of the outflows may overcome the gravity and become part of the solar wind .",
    "the lower limit of the mass flux density associated with these high - speed outflows is thus estimated to be about 1.67@xmath1910@xmath20 g  @xmath21  s@xmath1 if using a density of log ( _ n_@xmath4/@xmath3)=7.0 . while the average outflow mass flux density of the dimming region in the 01:15 - 03:30 scan on 2006 dec 14 is estimated to be about 1.0@xmath1910@xmath22 g  @xmath21  s@xmath1 if using results of single gaussian fit , i.e. , an average velocity of 12.5  km  s@xmath1 and a density of log ( _ n_@xmath4/@xmath3)=8.67 .",
    "these values are within one order of magnitude of the mass flux density of type - i spicules ( @xmath01.67@xmath1910@xmath22 g  @xmath21  s@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , type - ii spicules ( @xmath01.5@xmath1910@xmath22 g  @xmath21  s@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and outflows in the quiet - sun network ( @xmath01.6@xmath1910@xmath22 g  @xmath21  s@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "we have to point out that the calculations of the mass flux of the high - speed outflows are based on the assumption that there are only two emission components and that the primary component is at rest .",
    "however , in fact we can not tell whether the primary component is really at rest or moving upward with a small velocity ( e.g. , @xmath010  km  s@xmath1 ) since eis does not allow an absolute wavelength calibration .",
    "moreover , due to the large instrumental width we can not rule out the possibility of more than two components with each slightly doppler - shifted with respect to each other ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .      in the case",
    "of erupted cme loops or euv jets , since we can often unambiguously separate the ejecta emission component from the background emission component , e.g. , figures  fig.12&fig.13 , in principle we should be able to diagnose the plasma properties separately for each of the two components . using the fitting results shown in figure  fig.13 , we calculated the dem curves of the two components . from figure",
    "fig.18 we can see that the ejecta ( euv jet ) has more emission around log ( _ t_/k)=5.5 , as compared to the background .",
    "we can also see that the emitting materials of the euv jet are almost equally distributed over the temperature range of log ( _ t_/k)=5.4 - 6.1 .",
    "we have to mention that there was only one line with a formation temperature of log ( _ t_/k)@xmath235.5 ( he  256.32 ) in our eis observations so that the low - temperature part of the dem is not well constrained .",
    "future joint observations of eis and iris are thus highly desired .",
    "unfortunately , there are no very cool lines ( with a formation temperature comparable to that of he  256.32 ) in the 2011 feb 14 observation so that we could not perform a reliable dem analysis ( with a wide temperature coverage ) for the cme ejecta in this observation .",
    "the density sensitive line pair fe  264.78  &  274.20 were included in both the 2007 jun 5 and 2011 feb 14 observations .",
    "the fe  274.20 line is blended with si  274.18 .",
    "the intensity of si  274.18 can be estimated from si  275.35 since the ratio of the two is at most 0.25 @xcite .",
    "we used another observation which included both the si  275.35 and fe  274.20 lines @xcite and estimated that the contribution of si  274.18 to the total emission is at most 5.4% .",
    "thus , we simply ignored this blend .",
    "the theoretical relationship between the line ratio and density , as well as the measured values for the two components , are shown in figure  fig.19 .",
    "we can see that the measured values are in the density sensitive part of the theoretical relationship .",
    "the ejecta , which is an euv jet in the 2007 jun 5 observation and an erupted loop in the 2011 feb 14 observation , seems to have a larger density compared to the background emission .",
    "the measured densities are log ( _",
    "n_@xmath4/@xmath3)=9.89 for the euv jet and log ( _",
    "n_@xmath4/@xmath3)=10.01 for the erupted cme loop . however , the uncertainties of the line ratios for the ejecta are very large .",
    "this is largely due to the fact that the ejecta component in the fe  274.20 line profile was too close to the edge of the spectral window so that it was only partly resolved .",
    "the measured densities of the background components are consistent with ( in the jet case ) or about two times larger than ( in the cme case ) the normal ar densities at similar temperatures @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that the electron densities of euv jets and erupted cme loops are measured through an unambiguous decomposition of line profiles .",
    "unfortunately , no density sensitive line pairs formed at lower temperatures were included in these two observations .    for the euv jet",
    ", the total mass of the ejected material can be calculated by multiplying the mass flux density , cross section area and life time of the jet .",
    "taking a density of log ( _ n_@xmath4/@xmath3)=9.89 , a speed of 223  km  s@xmath1 , a jet width of @xmath24 and a life time of 11 minutes @xcite , the total ejected mass is estimated as 5.0@xmath25  g. this is about two orders of magnitude lower than the typical value of cme mass .",
    "the mass of the erupted loop in the 2011 feb 14 observation can be calculated by taking a density value of log ( _ n_@xmath4/@xmath3)=10.01 . after estimating the loop cross section area and loop length from the aia 193 image at 19:29 , the mass of the erupted loop was estimated to be 2.5@xmath26  g.",
    "such a value is comparable to the lower limit of the typical cme mass .",
    "however , we have to bear in mind that the density value we used only represents the density of the emitting materials with a temperature around log ( _ t_/k)=6.25 .",
    "we have to mention that both the dem and density calculations are based on ionization equilibrium . in the case of flows ,",
    "this equilibrium might be destroyed @xcite . to quantify how the flows impact the results of temperature and density diagnostics , further numerical simulations are needed .",
    "we have analyzed several data sets obtained by eis during solar eruptions such as cmes , coronal dimmings and euv jets .",
    "we have mainly identified three types of flows and investigated the properties of them .",
    "we have also performed density diagnostics and dem analyses for coronal dimmings , erupted cme loops and euv jets .",
    "our analyses suggest that spectroscopic observations can provide valuable information on the los kinematics and plasma properties of cmes and euv jets .",
    "previous analyses based on single gaussian fits reveal significant blueshift and enhanced line width in the cme - induced dimming regions .",
    "however , our detailed rb asymmetry analyses and rb - guided double gaussian fits of the coronal line profiles clearly show blueward asymmetries in dimming regions , suggesting perhaps the presence of a relatively weak ( @xmath010% of the total emission ) high - speed ( @xmath0100  km  s@xmath1 ) upflow component superimposed on a strong background emission component . this upflow component may result from the impulsive heating in the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "we have found that both the blue shift and line width correlate very well with the blueward asymmetry , suggesting that the significant blueshift and enhanced line width are actually largely caused by the superposition of the two components .",
    "this finding suggests that a small portion of the plasma in the dimming region is flowing outward at a velocity of the order of 100  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "our plasma diagnostics of the dimming region suggest that dimming is mainly an effect of density decrease rather than temperature change .",
    "the mass losses in dimming regions have been estimated from two different methods and they are 20%-60% of the masses of the associated cmes , suggesting that a significant part of the cme mass indeed comes from the dimming region . the mass flux carried by the outflows has also been estimated from observations .",
    "several temperature - dependent outflows have been found immediately outside the ( deepest ) dimming regions .",
    "the speed increases with temperature and it reaches @xmath0150  km  s@xmath1 at log ( _ t_/k)=6.3 .",
    "interestingly , our rb asymmetry analysis is able to detect some of these temperature - dependent outflows .",
    "these outflows are interpreted as evaporation flows which are perhaps driven by enhanced thermal conduction or nonthermal electron beams along reconnecting field lines , or induced by the interaction between the opened field lines in the dimming region and the closed loops in the surrounding plage region .",
    "profiles of emission lines formed at coronal and transition region temperatures clearly exhibit two well - separated components in erupted cme loops and euv jets . besides an almost stationary component accounting for the background emission ,",
    "there is a highly blueshifted ( @xmath0200  km  s@xmath1 ) component representing emission from the erupting material .",
    "the two components can be easily decomposed through a double gaussian fit and we have diagnosed the electron density , performed a dem analysis , and estimated the mass of the ejecta .",
    "different properties of the two components suggest the importance of separating emission from different sources when studying dynamic events . combining the speed of the blueshifted component and the projected speed of the ejecta from simultaneous imaging observations",

    "the high - speed outflowing component discussed in section 3.1 is usually much weaker than the primary component , which may prompt people to think whether these high - speed outflows are caused by a weak blend or simply random noise .",
    "however , from the red contours in figure  [ fig.1 ] we can clearly see that most fe  202.04 profiles showing significant blueward asymmetries actually have a high enough signal to noise ratio .",
    "moreover , the blueward asymmetries form patches and they coincide with patches of significant blue shift and enhanced line width . if the blueward asymmetries are cause by random noise , we should see a random distribution of asymmetric line profiles in space .",
    "the cause of the blueward asymmetries by possible blends at the blue wings of the line profiles can also be ruled out , since we see these blueward asymmetries in not only one line , but all strong coronal lines in the eis spectrum . as discussed in section 3.1 , the significant blueward asymmetries in the velocity range of 70 - 130  km  s@xmath1 at wings of these line profiles",
    "can not be caused by identified blends .",
    "there is another way to verify the above argument : the center to limb variation .",
    "we could not find any eis observation of a coronal dimming region as it rotates from the limb to disk center .",
    "however , we do have eis observations of ars as they rotate from the limb to disk center .",
    "as discussed in section 3.1 , the high - speed outflows in dimming regions seem to be very similar to those in ar boundaries .",
    "we take three eis raster scans of the ar 10978 from 2007 dec 10 to 15 for an analysis .",
    "details of these observations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the ar was close to the east limb , disk center and west limb on dec 10 , 12 and 15 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig.s1 ] shows the spatial distributions of the single gaussian parameters and profile asymmetries ( averaged over the velocity interval of 70 - 130  km  s@xmath1 , as obtained from the rb@xmath28 profiles ) for the three scans .",
    "center to limb variations of the profile asymmetries are clearly present .",
    "when the ar was on the disk center , we see prominent blueward asymmetries at both boundaries .",
    "as the ar rotated to the west limb , the profile asymmetries disappeared at the western boundary .",
    "and the profile asymmetries almost disappeared at the eastern boundary when the ar was close to the east limb .",
    "clearly , it is hard to explain this phenomenon by noise or blends . while our scenario , namely a high - speed outflow superimposed on a nearly static coronal background , can easily explain this center to limb variation by taking into account the los projection effect .",
    "when the ar was close to the west limb , the magnetic field lines in the western boundary are almost perpendicular to the los so that the projection of the outflow speed on the los direction is very small , leading to a very small velocity offset between different components and greatly reduced blueward asymmetries in the velocity interval of 70 - 130  km  s@xmath1 .",

    "<S> solar eruptions , particularly coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) and extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) jets , have rarely been investigated with spectroscopic observations . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze several data sets obtained by the euv imaging spectrometer onboard _ hinode _ and find various types of flows during cmes and jet eruptions . </S>",
    "<S> cme - induced dimming regions are found to be characterized by significant blueshift and enhanced line width by using a single gaussian fit . </S>",
    "<S> while a red - blue ( rb ) asymmetry analysis and a rb - guided double gaussian fit of the coronal line profiles indicate that these are likely caused by the superposition of a strong background emission component and a relatively weak ( @xmath010% ) high - speed ( @xmath0100  km  s@xmath1 ) upflow component . </S>",
    "<S> this finding suggests that the outflow velocity in the dimming region is probably of the order of 100  km  s@xmath1 , not @xmath020  km  s@xmath1 as reported previously . </S>",
    "<S> density and temperature diagnostics of the dimming region suggest that dimming is primarily an effect of density decrease rather than temperature change . </S>",
    "<S> the mass losses in dimming regions as estimated from different methods are roughly consistent with each other and they are 20%-60% of the masses of the associated cmes . with the guide of rb asymmetry analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we also find several temperature - dependent outflows ( speed increases with temperature ) immediately outside the ( deepest ) dimming region . </S>",
    "<S> these outflows may be evaporation flows which are caused by the enhanced thermal conduction or nonthermal electron beams along reconnecting field lines , or induced by the interaction between the opened field lines in the dimming region and the closed loops in the surrounding plage region . in an erupted cme loop and an euv jet , profiles of emission lines formed at coronal and transition region temperatures </S>",
    "<S> are found to exhibit two well - separated components , an almost stationary component accounting for the background emission and a highly blueshifted ( @xmath0200  km  s@xmath1 ) component representing emission from the erupting material . </S>",
    "<S> the two components can easily be decomposed through a double gaussian fit and we can diagnose the electron density , temperature and mass of the ejecta . combining the speed of the blueshifted component and the projected speed of the erupting material derived from simultaneous imaging observations , we can calculate the real speed of the ejecta . </S>"
