    "each of the known amsps have now been well - studied in followup observations , and a review of their observational properties can be found in @xcite .",
    "six of the seven are transients with outburst intervals of 2 or more years .",
    "however , activity of the most recently - discovered example , hete  j1900.1@xmath02455@xcite , has continued long beyond the usual active interval for the other six sources .",
    "the latest observation , on 2006 february 2 , indicates that the source is still at approximately the same flux level as it was throughout the second half of 2005 .",
    "the source is also unusual in that the pulsations are not detected consistently while the source is active @xcite .    here",
    "we present a summary of the outburst history of the accretion - powered msps , in order to compare the long - term accretion rates .",
    "we also introduce a new method which can give an upper limit on the distance for sources where no bursts have been detected .",
    "we analysed observations of the amsps made with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "we used measurements of the persistent flux and peak flux of thermonuclear ( type i ) bursts ( where available ) tabled in the catalog of galloway et al .",
    "( 2006a , in preparation ) .",
    "the data were analysed with lheasoft version 5.3 , released 2003 november 17 .",
    "the persistent flux was measured by averaging the integrated flux from the best - fit absorbed blackbody plus power - law model in the energy range 2.525  kev , to spectra extracted separately for each pcu .",
    "we used a bolometric correction to the 2.525  kev flux based on absorbed comptt model fits to combined pca and hexte data .",
    "the x - ray colors for individual amsps were relatively constant over each outburst , and so we adopted a constant correction for each source : xte  j1814@xmath0338 , 1.86 ; sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 , 2.12 ; xte  j0929@xmath0314 , 1.80 ; xte  j1751@xmath0305 , 1.66 ; xte  j1807@xmath0294 , 1.57 ; and igr  j00291 + 5934 , 2.54 .",
    "we estimated the fluence for each outburst using public _ rxte _",
    "pca and asm measurements . for intervals where the outburst was not covered by pca observations , we integrated the asm intensities instead , using a linear cross - calibration between the pca and the nearest 1-day average 210  kev asm intensities .",
    "xte  j1807@xmath0294  and xte  j1751@xmath0305  lie towards the galactic center , and a cataclysmic variable is within the @xmath1 _ rxte _ field - of - view centred on igr  j00291 + 5934 .",
    "thus , for those sources we subtracted out a baseline level of 10 , 5 and @xmath2 respectively , which we attribute to contributions from diffuse background and/or unrelated field sources .",
    "the fluences derived by this method , scaled to give the estimated bolometric values , are listed in table [ outbursts ] .",
    "we propagated the errors from the uncertainties on individual asm / pca measurements .",
    "we note that the calculated fluences were generally consistent with prior estimates , to within the uncertainties .    the time - averaged accretion rate driven by angular momentum loss arising from gravitational radiation from the binary",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the minimum companion mass , @xmath5 the neutron star mass , and @xmath6 the binary orbital period .",
    "because pulse timing allows measurement only of the projected semimajor axis @xmath7 , only a lower limit on @xmath4 is available .",
    "thus , on equating the time - averaged x - ray flux @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we derived lower limits on the distance @xmath10 for the interval prior to each outburst ( table [ outbursts ] ) .",

    "the combination of very low expected burst rates for these sources , and low duty cycles for the pca observations ( e.g. 6.6% for xte  j1807@xmath0294 ) makes it difficult to constrain the distances .",
    "the duty cycle for the pca observations of igr  j00291 + 5934 , on the other hand , was higher , at 27% . since the mass donor in this source",
    "is also thought to be h - rich , we expect the highest burst rate of all four sources with no detected bursts , and thus is the least likely to have missed all the bursts .",
    "we generated plausible burst sequences for igr  j00291 + 5934  based on the cubic - spline interpolated flux evolution measured during the 2004 december outburst , with burst ignition conditions calculated as in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details .",
    "we adopted a grid of distances beginning at the lower limits in table [ outbursts ] .",
    "we assumed a @xmath48 neutron star with radius @xmath49 , giving a surface gravity @xmath50 and redshift @xmath51 .",

    "we fixed @xmath54 ( equivalent to solar metallicity ) throughout .",
    "we varied the start time of the first burst evenly within the first predicted burst interval , and also introduced a modest degree of scatter on the burst times , with a standard deviation of 0.13  hr we then checked how many of the predicted burst times fell within the intervals during which the pca was observing the source .",
    "we interpreted the fraction of trials which resulted in one or more detected bursts , as the probability that we could reject that set of parameters .    at the lowest value of @xmath53 , the predicted burst rate was sufficiently low that the likelihood of missing any bursts present was high , even for distances as large as 8  kpc",
    "however , for higher values of @xmath44 , the higher @xmath39 implied by such large distances made it increasingly unlikely that we would have missed all the bursts . thus , the likely distance limit became smaller .",
    "since we expect the mass donor in igr  j00291 + 5934  is h - rich , we expect a source distance of no more than 6  kpc ( fig .",

    "we have derived distances or limits to the known amsps via analysis of _ rxte _ observations . based on the outburst history of the amsps ,",

    ", we find evidence that the long - term averaged flux is decreasing .",
    "for the two transients with independent constraints on the distance from the peak flux of photospheric radius - expansion bursts , sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  and xte  j1814@xmath0338 , the maximum lower distance limit derived from equating the average flux and @xmath9 is just above the distance range derived from the bursts .",
    "we also derived an upper limit on the distance to igr  j00291 + 5934  of 6  kpc , based on the predicted burst rate and the duty cycle for the _ rxte _ observations .",
    "given a sufficiently high observational duty cycle , this method may be used to derive distance limits on other lmxbs where bursts have not been detected .    finally , we note the discovery of hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 , the first `` quasi - persistent '' amsp . as of 2006 february",
    "this source is still active , more than 8 months after its discovery .",
    "although the estimated @xmath55%  @xmath42 is significantly lower than the peak reached by most of the other transient amsps , the fact that activity is continuous indicates that the long - term time - averaged @xmath39 of this source may exceed all the others . in that case ,",
