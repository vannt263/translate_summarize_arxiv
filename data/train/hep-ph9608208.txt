    "noncommutative differential geometry ( ncg ) on the discrete space such as @xmath13 and , in general , @xmath14 ; minkowski space multiplied by several points space allows one to regard the higgs field as the gauge field on the same footing as the ordinary gauge field .",
    "a number of articles in various versions of ncg @xcite-@xcite have confirmed this fact by reconstructing the standard model and the grand unified theory ( gut ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite without any theoretical and experimental contradictions .",
    "this is because the ncg approach to understand the higgs mechanism apparently shows the reason for the existence of the higgs boson field and , in addition , it does not requires any other extra physical mode except for those in the standard model and gut .",
    "the bosonic lagrangian of the spontaneously broken gauge theory derived from the ncg approach has the restrictions on the gauge and the higgs quartic coupling constants .",
    "these restrictions yield the numerical estimate of the weinberg angle and the mass relation between the higgs boson and other particle such as gauge boson and top quark , _ though these relations hold only in tree level_. several works have been done @xcite , @xcite to estimate the quantum effects of these relations by assuming them to hold at some renormalization point .",
    "shinohara , nishida , tanaka and sogami @xcite have recently calculated in a very clear formulation the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of the mass relation @xmath15 for the higgs boson and top quark , which was proposed by sogami @xcite in a variant of ncg with the generalized covariant derivative with gauge and higgs boson fields operating on the total fermion field .",
    "since connes proposed the first idea @xcite concerning ncg , many versions of the ncg approach @xcite-@xcite have appeared to understand the higgs mechanism , among which the present author @xcite , @xcite has also proposed a characteristic formulation of ncg .",
    "our formulation of a ncg is a generalization of the usual differential geometry on an ordinary manifold to the discrete manifold @xmath16 .",
    "the reconstruction of so(10 ) gut @xcite and left - right symmetric gauge model @xcite had been already performed according to our ncg scheme . in a ncg on @xmath13 , the extra differential one - form @xmath17 in @xmath18",
    "is introduced in addition to the usual one - form @xmath19 in @xmath20 , and therefore our formulation is very similar to ordinary differential geometry , whereas , in connesoriginal one and his follower s ncg , the dirac matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 are used to describe the generalized gauge field . in a ncg , the gauge and the higgs boson fields are given as coefficients of @xmath19 and @xmath17 in the generalized connection on @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "however , there is no symmetry to mix @xmath19 and @xmath17 , and , therefore , the ordinary gauge field can not be transformed to the higgs boson field . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "three generations of fermions including left and right - handed quarks and leptons and the strong interaction are incorporated in a new scheme of our ncg to reconstruct the standard model . by setting coupling constants on the @xmath23 and @xmath24 planes with an argument @xmath25 in @xmath18 to be equal ,",
    "we could obtain @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "following shinohara and co - workers @xcite , we will perform in this article the rg analysis of the mass relation @xmath27 for the gauge and higgs bosons , which holds at the energy derived from @xmath1 as for the running su(2)@xmath2 and u(1)@xmath3 gauge coupling constants . in other version of ncg",
    "including sogami s approach @xcite , the mass relation between the higgs boson and top quark is presented , whereas ours is the mass relation between the higgs and charged gauge bosons .",
    "this is because the yukawa coupling constants written in matrix form in the generation space are not contained in the generalized gauge field in our formulation .",
    "this article consists of five sections .",
    "the next section presents the brief review of our new scheme of a ncg in ref.@xcite which incorporates the strong interaction . in the third section",
    ", the reconstruction of the standard model based on the new scheme of our ncg presented in the second section is reviewed .",
    "a characteristic point is to take the fermion field to be a vector in 24-dimensional space containing color and three generations indices .",
    "the fourth section , the main section in this paper , includes the numerical estimation of the rg evolution of the mass relation @xmath27 on the assumption that it holds at a energy of @xmath1 with su(2)@xmath2 and u(1 ) gauge coupling constants .",
    "the last section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "we review our previous formulation @xcite proposed to reconstruct the standard model in which three generations of left and right - handed quarks and leptons are taken into account and also the strong interaction is incorporated .",
    "a characteristic point of this formulation is to take the left and right - handed fermions @xmath28 with arguments @xmath29 and @xmath30 in @xmath20 and @xmath18 , respectively as @xmath31 where subscripts @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the left - handed and right - handed fermions , respectively and superscripts @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the color indices .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath28 has the index for the three generation and so do the explicit expressions for fermions on the right hand sides of eq.([2.1 ] ) . in the strict expressions ,",
    "@xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 in eq.([2.1 ] ) should be replaced by @xmath41 respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath42 is a vector in the 24-dimensional space . in order to construct the dirac lagrangian of standard model corresponding to @xmath42 in eqs.([2.1 ] ) , we must need 24-dimensional generalized covariant derivative composed of gauge and higgs fields on @xmath13 .",
    "this is achieved by developing a ncg on the discrete space in the follows .",

    "thus , eq.([2.9 ] ) means that the color symmetry of the strong interaction does not break spontaneously .    in order to find the explicit forms of gauge and higgs fields according to eq.([2.3 ] ) , we need the following important algebraic rule of non - commutative geometry .",

    "if we use the data reported by dawson @xcite , @xmath230 for @xmath231 . generally speaking , the ncg approach provides the yang - mills - higgs lagrangian with the restrictions on gauge and higgs quartic coupling constants .",
    "our mass relation @xmath27 is with respect to gauge and higgs boson masses , whereas other version of ncg @xcite , @xcite including sogami s approach @xcite present the mass relation between the higgs boson and top quark .",
    "this is because the yukawa coupling constants written in matrix form in the generation space are not contained in the generalized gauge field in our formulation .",
    "this aspect is a characteristic point of our approach compared to others .",
    "this is due to the introduction of one - form basis @xmath232 in @xmath20 and @xmath17 in @xmath18 instead of @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "this leads to the meaningful higgs potential even in one fermion generation and the mass relation for the higgs and gauge bosons .",
    "therefore , we predict relatively small higgs boson mass as seen in this article .",
    "calculations have performed within one loop approximation and top quark dominance is assumed in the whole range of @xmath235 in the rg equations for @xmath7 functions .",
    "though there are fairly uncertainties with respect to yukawa coupling constants for three generations of fermions , it is very interesting to analyze the rg equations for the higgs boson mass in two loop approximation .",
    "this will be attempted in future work .",
