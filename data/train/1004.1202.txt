    "the area of intimate contact between surfaces plays a central role in continuum models of friction and adhesion . due to surface roughness , this real area of contact @xmath1 is typically much less than the apparent area of the surfaces @xmath2 .",
    "analytic and numerical work indicates that @xmath1 rises linearly with load for nonadhesive surfaces , whether they deform elastically @xcite or plastically @xcite .",
    "this linear relation , and the assumption of a constant shear stress , provides one of the most common explanations of the linear relation between friction and load in many experiments @xcite .    the advent of nanotechnology and the ability to measure friction in contacts with molecular dimensions has led to great interest in extending continuum models to nanometer scales and identifying its limits @xcite .",
    "one fundamental question is what contact means at the molecular scale .",
    "the mere presence of an interaction between surfaces is not enough , since attractive van der waals interactions extend to arbitrary scales .",
    "one common approach has been to associate the onset of direct repulsion between atoms with contact @xcite . for most systems",
    "this coincides with common definitions of atomic diameters @xcite , but the notion of contact is still complicated by thermal fluctuations and the finite range of interactions .",
    "these are not commonly included in continuum models and recent work reveals that they greatly complicate the extension of continuum views of contact to atomic scales .",
    "early experiments found that friction measurements could be fit by applying continuum theory to nanometer scale contacts and assuming a constant shear stress at the interface @xcite .",
    "simulations with tips of the same size showed that while friction forces could be fit in this way , the fit parameters were often significantly different than the independently determined material properties @xcite .",
    "the actual area of contact was often a factor of two larger than the continuum prediction , the contact stiffness was up to an order of magnitude smaller , and the friction force varied by two orders of magnitude with changes in atomic geometry by much less than an atomic diameter .",
    "knippenberg et al .",
    "@xcite examined contact between atoms in sliding contacts between nanometer scale tips and a substrate covered with a surfactant .",
    "they found that the area of contact was broadened due to the compliance of the surfactant layer , but that most of the atoms contributed little to the normal and lateral ( friction ) forces .",
    "roughly 90% of the force was carried by only 10% of the atoms , calling into question the binary nature of contact .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "@xcite considered the effect of single monolayers of short chains .",
    "they also found very large variations in the force on individual atoms , both spatially and temporally .",
    "one consequence was that measures that included the magnitude of forces , such as moments of the pressure distribution , gave very different contact radii than simply counting the atoms feeling any nonzero repulsion .",
    "mo et al . have considered contact between a bare diamond substrate and an amorphous surface that is nominally spherical @xcite .",
    "they found that the number of contacting atoms grew linearly with the applied load .",
    "they concluded that their surfaces were sufficiently rough that the continuum results predicting area proportional to load could be applied .",

    "yang et al .",
    "@xcite have tested persson s theory by simulating contact between a flat substrate and a surface with roughness on all length scales .",
    "they found many more atoms with low forces than predicted .",
    "the area of contact was not obtained by counting atoms , but by fitting the distribution @xmath3 at larger forces .",
    "the result was then in reasonable agreement with persson s predictions .",
    "luan et al .",
    "@xcite examined two dimensional models with much larger linear dimensions .",
    "they also found many atoms had low forces and that @xmath3 decreased monotonically with @xmath4 . the contact area obtained by counting atoms was extremely sensitive to the detailed atomic structure .",
    "one might not expect that continuum theory could capture these local details , but it did correctly capture the long - range stress correlations in the simulations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we explore the effect of thermal fluctuations on different definitions of contact .",
    "the simplest possible case , contact between atomically flat surfaces , is considered first . even identical crystals with atoms directly over each other exhibit unexpected behavior .",
    "the number of atoms exhibiting repulsion at any instant rises linearly with load , as might be expected for rough surfaces in continuum theory .",
    "this linear scaling is observed for temperatures from @xmath5 to 1/4 of the melting temperature , @xmath6 .",
    "the contact area determined from time - averaged forces shows full contact for this geometry , but not for incommensurate crystals with different lattice constants or surfaces cut from amorphous solids .",
    "a simple harmonic mean - field model for thermal fluctuations of individual surface atoms provides a quantitative description of the above results .",
    "it also explains several other new observations in our simulations .",
    "these include a nearly universal exponential distribution of the magnitude of instantaneous repulsive forces , and a corresponding universal distribution of the fraction of load carried by the atoms with the largest force .",
    "there is also a direct correlation between the fraction of time in contact and the time averaged force on an atom that is independent of surface structure .",
    "the force required for atoms to remain in contact more than half the time is surprisingly large at typical temperatures , with the corresponding pressure comparable to the ideal hardness .",
    "the prototypical case of contact between a spherical tip and flat substrate is considered next .",
    "different atomic geometries of the tip , including commensurate , incommensurate and amorphous are considered .",
    "the same harmonic model used for flat surfaces describes the time average force and fraction of time in contact for tip atoms . for nonadhesive tips ,",
    "the contact area obtained by counting the number of atoms with a repulsive time - averaged force depends on the observation time and grows monotonically .",

    "in continuum theory , contact between two rough elastic solids can be mapped to that between a flat elastic substrate and a rigid rough upper solid @xcite .",
    "we consider the latter case , and take the upper solid to be atomically flat or a spherical tip .",
    "previous studies at zero temperature indicate that the continuum mapping remains approximately valid at atomic scales @xcite , but it does not take into account thermal effects . at any finite temperature ,",
    "annealed roughness from thermal fluctuations will be superimposed on top of any quenched structural roughness on the surfaces . while the mapping may not accurately capture the quantitative effect of thermal fluctuations on both surfaces , using a rigid upper surface and a flat elastic substrate minimizes the parameter space to be explored .",
    "preliminary results for two elastic solids show the same effects and trends are mentioned where relevant .",

    "the amorphous tip is a spherical shell carved out of the same amorphous solid from which the flat amorphous surface is cut .",
    "tips used in afm experiments are likely to be closest in structure to the amorphous or stepped tips .",
    "the spherical tips and flat upper surfaces all have a finite thickness .",
    "this is irrelevant for simulations of nonadhesive contacts . for adhesive contacts",
    ", the finite thickness merely reduces the effective adhesion between two surfaces and does not affect the trends and conclusions presented below .",

    "we equilibrated the system for at least @xmath54 after each change in load , and data were typically averaged over a subsequent @xmath55 .    for contact between nominally flat surfaces ,",
    "the natural dimensionless measure of load is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the nominal area of the contacting surfaces , @xmath58 is the mean pressure in the contact , and @xmath59 is the effective modulus .",
    "the latter is related to young s modulus @xmath60 and the poisson ratio @xmath61 by @xmath62 and @xmath63 for our substrate @xcite .",

    "molecular dynamics simulations provide complete information about forces and positions , but it is not obvious how this information should be used to identify the real area of contact . for nonadhesive contact ,",
    "it is natural to say an atom is in contact when it feels a force from the opposing surface .",
    "this can be generalized to adhesive contact by saying atoms separated by less than some distance are in contact . in the following we use the same distance as for nonadhesive contact ,",
    "so atoms are counted as contacting when the force between them is repulsive .",
    "this definition has also been used in discussing afm experiments @xcite , and previous simulations @xcite .",
    "one can define an area of real contact , @xmath66 , by multiplying the number of contacting atoms @xmath67 by the area per atom @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "thermal fluctuations introduce ambiguities in this definition because atoms fluctuate in and out of contact .",
    "we first consider the case of nominally flat non - adhesive surfaces . from the continuum perspective",
    "one would expect that these surfaces should be in complete contact , @xmath70 , at any positive load .",
    "however surfaces constructed of discrete atoms can never be perfectly flat .",
    "even when all the rigid atoms are at the same height , as for commensurate and incommensurate cases , the height at which substrate atoms feel a given force varies with lateral position .",
    "this corrugation depends on the relative size of substrate atoms and the normal force , but the peak - to - peak height change is of order @xmath71 for the cases considered here @xcite .",
    "the change in height of atoms on the amorphous surface leads to additional roughness of the same order . because the potential changes very rapidly with separation on these scales , the atomic scale corrugation of any surface can lead to large changes in contact properties even in the limit of zero temperature considered in refs . @xcite .",
    "thermal fluctuations lead to additional time varying or annealed roughness on the surface .",
    "an estimate of the magnitude of local fluctuations can be obtained from the root mean squared ( rms ) normal displacement of a surface atom if its eight neighbors are held fixed : @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",

    "these values are similar to the measured height fluctuations discussed further below",
    ". one can estimate the period of normal vibrations @xmath78 in the same way : @xmath79 .    while @xmath80 is always smaller than the quenched surface corrugations described above , thermal fluctuations lead to time variation that significantly complicates the definition of contact .",
    "in particular , the number and identity of atoms that exert a force on the opposing surface varies with time .",
    "some authors have associated @xmath81 with the mean number of contacting atoms at any instant in time @xcite . however , continuum theories generally consider time - averaged forces and displacements . from this perspective",
    "it may be more natural to find the average force on surface atoms over a long time interval and identify all atoms with an average repulsion as in contact .",
    "one can interpolate between these limiting cases by defining @xmath82 , the mean area associated with atoms that exert a repulsive force over an averaging interval @xmath0 , where @xmath0 varies from a single time step to the length of the run @xcite .",

    "the contact area for the stepped tip is equal to that of the bottom terrace at low loads and jumps up at high loads when the second terrace contacts .",
    "the other tips all show the same scaling as the hertz prediction at low loads , but with different prefactors . as shown by luan and robbins , the contact is spread over a larger radius than predicted by hertz theory @xcite .",
    "all atoms of the commensurate surface that lie within this region make contact , leading to an area about twice as large as the hertz prediction in fig .",
    "[ conareatipnonadh ] ( a ) .",
    "the quenched variation in substrate - tip separations for incommensurate and amorphous surfaces reduces the fraction of atoms that contact .",
    "this almost exactly compensates for the increased radius of contact for the incommensurate surface , while the number of contacting atoms is roughly half the hertz prediction for the amorphous surface .",
    "the ratio of md results to hertz predictions depends sensitively on the ratio of lattice constants in the incommensurate case @xcite , and to the density in the amorphous case , but is typically within a factor of two .",
    "the time interval is much more important for high temperatures .",
    "the area corresponding to atoms in contact at any instant is substantially reduced from hertz theory in all cases .",
    "the rise with load is also more rapid than the hertz prediction , showing something like the more linear area - load relation found for flat surfaces .",
    "note that the range of dimensionless pressures is much higher for tips because of the small radius .",
    "the hertz prediction for our geometry and loads gives @xmath251 between 0.01 to 0.07 , while for flat surfaces @xmath252 ranged from less than @xmath253 to 0.01 in fig .",

    "the results are in excellent agreement with the simulations and imply that the contact area of tips should scale linearly with load at low @xmath251 .",
    "it is not possible to test this scaling to lower loads in our simulations since there are only a handful of atoms touching at the two lowest loads . accessing the lowest @xmath251 studied for",
    "flat surfaces would require increasing @xmath64 into the micrometer range .",
    "this size scale is relevant for nanoindenters and is consistent with common estimates of the size of surface asperities in macroscopic contacts @xcite .",
    "as the averaging time interval @xmath0 grows , the contact area rises above the hertz prediction .",
    "the increase is more than an order of magnitude at low loads",

    "the fractional change in area scales as @xmath261 and would become smaller for micrometer and larger tips .",
    "the time averaged pressure is small in the region where contact is only made possible by thermal fluctuations .",
    "one consequence is that measures of the contact radius based on the second moment of the pressure distribution remain closer to the value predicted by hertz and measured at low temperature @xcite .",
    "another is that a small fraction of the atoms carry a very large fraction of the load .",

    "the fit parameters are generally within a factor of two of independently measured quantities and may thus be useful in extracting approximate values from experiments .",
    "however , our results reinforce the conclusion reached previously @xcite that the success of fits to m - d theory does not represent a quantitative success of continuum theory , which can not be expected to hold at atomic scales .    the contact areas in fig .",

    "it is also harder to describe with continuum theory .",
    "the area grows smoothly with load , but could not be fit to m - d theory .",
    "the reason is that the power law describing the rate of increase in area is significantly different from the value of 2/3 that enters continuum theories .",

    "continuum theory would predict a sharp transition from no contact to full contact .",
    "the transition would occur at zero load for nonadhesive surfaces , and also for adhesive surfaces if contact is identified with repulsion .",
    "this sharp transition is only seen in atomic simulations for the highly unlikely case of two identical , commensurate surfaces with atoms aligned on top of each other . even there , it is only found near zero temperature or using time averaged forces with adhesive interactions . in all other cases , the contact area rises very gradually .",
    "indeed , pressures comparable to the ideal hardness are required to reach full contact .",
    "measures of contact area based on instantaneous forces between atoms were shown to be extremely sensitive to thermal roughness .",
    "one common approach is to identify the contact area @xmath66 with the mean number of atoms feeling a repulsive force times the area per atom @xcite . for both flat surfaces and spherical tips , thermal fluctuations lead to a linear rise in @xmath66 with load when the mean pressure in the contact is small . for flat commensurate surfaces ,",
    "linear scaling extends over the entire temperature range studied , corresponding to @xmath27 from 0.01% to 25% of the melting temperature . for incommensurate and amorphous surfaces ,",

    "a simple mean - field model was developed that quantitatively describes changes in @xmath66 .",
    "each substrate atom is assumed to be bound to the substrate by a harmonic spring @xmath109 that represents the net effect of bonds to neighboring substrate atoms .",
    "the atom also feels a force from the opposing wall @xmath154 that depends on its height @xmath26 .",
    "the probability of an atom having a given height and force can then be calculated from the boltzmann equation . over a wide range of parameters",
    "only the effective stiffness @xmath189 associated with the second derivative of @xmath155 near its minimum is important .",
    "in addition to reproducing the variation of @xmath66 with load , this simple harmonic mean - field model makes several predictions about local forces that are consistent with simulations .",
    "one is that the distribution of instantaneous forces @xmath4 on substrate atoms is exponential , which leads to a universal distribution of the fraction of load born by the atoms with the largest forces .",
    "[ forcestasnapshot ] and [ exponentialforce ] show that these predictions describe contact between flat surfaces with all geometries except at extremely low temperatures ( @xmath270 ) and high pressures ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "another prediction is that for all atomic ( commensurate , incommensurate , amorphous , or stepped ) and large scale ( flat or sphere ) geometries , the mean force on an atom and the fraction of time in contact have a functional relationship that depends only on temperature .",
    "the same relation holds for adhesive surfaces if contact is defined as repulsion and the mean repulsive force @xmath202 is calculated .",
    "the fraction of time in contact rises linearly with force at low forces and this quantitatively describes the variation of @xmath66 with load for commensurate surfaces . for incommensurate and amorphous surfaces ,",
    "the prediction need only be scaled by a constant factor to include the fact that some substrate atoms are too far from wall atoms to make contact . the linear relation between @xmath66 and load or @xmath203 and",
    "@xmath202 breaks down when the fraction of time in contact approaches unity .",
    "this does not occur until quite large values of @xmath251 .",
    "for example , @xmath203 reaches 50% at @xmath272 and @xmath273 for @xmath274 and @xmath275 , respectively .",
    "the simplicity of the harmonic mean - field model allows us to make estimates about the range of validity of the above statements that are quite general and should not depend on the details of atomic interactions .",
    "equation [ simple2 ] gives the ratio between the dimensionless pressure and the fraction of area in contact at any instant .",
    "the main variation in this ratio comes from @xmath80 , which rises as the square root of temperature .",
    "the lindemann criterion says that the value of @xmath276 should be about 10% of the nearest - neighbor spacing at the melting temperature @xcite .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath277 . inserting this into eq .",
    "[ simple2 ] and multiplying and dividing by @xmath109 we find @xmath278 with @xmath279 the values of @xmath59 and @xmath109 are both determined by the interactions between neighbors , and the ratio @xmath280 will generally be near unity . for the potential used here it is @xmath281 .",
    "the value of @xmath282 should also be close to unity if interactions across the interface are comparable to internal interactions . the value of @xmath236 is directly related to @xmath100 via eq .",
    "[ simple1 ] , but varies extremely slowly .",

    "one can thus conclude that @xmath284 for any potential .",
    "note that this expression differs from the simple estimate based on thermal collisions in eq .",
    "[ csuba ] by a factor of order unity .",
    "molecular dynamics is only accurate for temperatures high enough compared to the debye temperature that quantum effects can be ignored .",
    "this typically corresponds to @xmath285 and applies to most materials at room temperature .",
    "as @xmath27 increases from @xmath286 to @xmath6 the pressure required for atoms to be in contact more than 50% of the time rises from @xmath287 to 0.05 .",
    "plastic deformation sets in when @xmath248 exceeds the hardness , @xmath114 .",
    "typical values of @xmath115 are of order @xmath5 to @xmath288 for macroscopic crystals .",
    "while larger values may be observed in defect free systems and at nanometer scales , the theoretical limit is only @xmath289 .",
    "thus one can generally expect that atoms will spend a significant fraction of their time out of repulsive contact at temperatures and pressures of experimental interest .",
    "our simulations reduced the number of free parameters and the size of the simulation by keeping one surface rigid . if both surfaces are compliant , there are two offsetting changes .",
    "one is that there are thermal fluctuations by atoms on both sides that increase thermal roughness .",
    "this can be modeled roughly by replacing @xmath290 by the sum of the inverse values for the two surfaces .",
    "continuum contact mechanics says that the inverse of the effective modulus is related in the same way to the moduli of the two solids .",
    "since the same interactions determine both @xmath59 and @xmath109 , the two changes should nearly cancel .",
    "simulations for a few examples confirmed this .",
    "the above discussion neglects quenched geometric disorder due to differences in separation between substrate atoms and atoms on the opposing surface .",
    "this reduces the number of atoms on amorphous and incommensurate surfaces that can be brought into contact by thermal fluctuations . at @xmath274 and 0.25 we found that the mean - field theory still worked if one reduced the available number of contacts by a constant fraction .",
    "for example , the fit lines in fig",
    ". 5 used 84% for the incommensurate surface and 57% for the amorphous case .",
    "at the much lower temperature of @xmath28 , @xmath291 is much smaller than the atomic scale roughness on incommensurate and amorphous surfaces . particularly in the case of amorphous surfaces , those atoms that contact at a given load stay in contact",
    "most of the time .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "2 , where for all loads @xmath82 increases by less than a factor of 2 as @xmath292 increases from 0 to 500 . one can also calculate the mean force on atoms from the measured @xmath66 and @xmath52 . at the lowest load in fig .",
    "2c , @xmath293 , which is larger than the force @xmath294 where the linear relation between force and @xmath203 breaks down .",
    "thus , in contrast to the commensurate case , the rise in @xmath66 reflects an increase in the number of atoms that are close enough to contact rather than an increase in the fraction of time in contact . as load increases ,",
    "contacting atoms are pushed down relative to other atoms , allowing new atoms to contact the opposing surface .",
    "note that the rise in @xmath66 with load is nonlinear for both incommensurate and amorphous surfaces .",
    "continuum theory predicts a linear relation for rough surfaces , but it is not clear it can be applied at these scales or that the surfaces have an appropriate distribution of roughness .",
    "experimental surfaces are generally much rougher than those considered here , with bumps on top of bumps at all scales @xcite . at low loads",
    ", contact occurs only where two asperities from opposing surfaces overlap . in continuum theories ,",
    "the linear area - load relation comes from the growth in the number of such contacts with load .",
    "the distribution of contact sizes and forces remains unchanged .",
    "simulations of the spherical tip geometry give insight into the behavior of asperity contacts . as for flat surfaces , at typical experimental temperatures , thermal roughness leads to a linear relation between area and pressure until @xmath251 is 0.01 to 0.05 .",
    "this pressure is generally large enough to produce plastic deformation under micrometer and larger asperities , and comparable to the hardness of nanoasperities . in the cases of nanoasperities ,",
    "these and previous simulations @xcite show that the contact area is not accurately described by continuum theory . thus it is not clear that @xmath66 will follow continuum predictions @xcite for rough surfaces at experimental temperatures .",
    "since continuum theory ignores thermal fluctuations , it is natural to work with definitions of contact area based on time - averaged rather than instantaneous forces . for adhesive surfaces ,",
    "the area where time - averaged forces are repulsive is nearly independent of averaging time and is insensitive to temperature .",
    "while this seems the least ambiguous definition of contact , it only shows a sharp transition from no contact to full contact for flat commensurate surfaces . for flat incommensurate and amorphous surfaces ,",
    "the transition is spread over a range @xmath295 that is comparable to the pressures needed to produce plasticity .",
    "the time averaged force gives much less satisfactory results for nonadhesive surfaces .",
    "since the force is always repulsive , any contact leads to a positive time - averaged force .",
    "the contact area grows monotonically with the averaging time interval @xmath0 , leading to substantial ambiguity in @xmath66 for both flat and spherical surfaces .",
    "averaging positions instead of forces reduces the sensitivity to rare events .",
    "however , one finds that the mean separation is beyond the interaction range for most loads , implying that there is no contact even though there is a large repulsive force .",
    "averaging positions and forces gives similar results for adhesive surfaces if contact is based on repulsive interactions between atoms .",
    "however we have found that another definition gives a sharper transition from partial to full contact for incommensurate surfaces . instead of basing contact on forces between atoms ,",
    "it is based on the separation between surfaces .",
    "a delaunay triangulation of each surface is performed and triangles on opposing surfaces are said to contact if they are separated by less than the distance where atomic interactions become repulsive .",
    "we are currently exploring whether associating contact with surface separations instead of atomic forces improves the comparison of simulations and continuum calculations of rough surfaces with multiasperity contacts .",
