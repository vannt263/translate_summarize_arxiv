    "cometary nuclei are the most primitive objects in the solar system . within about 3 au of the sun , solar heating causes the surface temperature of the nucleus to rise above 200 k ; water ice sublimes and other volatiles and icy dust grains are expelled from the surface . the motion , chemistry and rate of sublimation of molecules from the icy grains are influenced by the solar wind and solar radiation .",
    "initially the escaping gases form a dynamic , gravitationally - unbound atmosphere , the coma .",
    "they are subsequently swept into the comet s plasma and dust tails and eventually dissipate into interplanetary space .",
    "the surface of the nucleus is processed during the course of repeated visits to the inner solar system , becoming covered with a rubble blanket of particles too large to be dragged away by escaping gas . during the course of numerous perihelia ,",
    "the outer surface becomes completely depleted of volatile materials which either escape from the surface or else migrate inwards .",
    "this creates an outer mantle of siliceous dust ( huebner , 2008 ) , above a layered structure in which the more volatile species are found at greater depths ( prialnik et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "this structure results in the great variety that is observed in active comets .",
    "cometary nuclei typically have radii of @xmath53 km and are not able to be resolved from earth . during close approaches , the inner coma of some comets are resolvable with large terrestrial instruments .",
    "however , in general , data obtained with earth - based instruments are indicative of conditions in a wider region of the coma , and our understanding of conditions within the inner coma ( a region extending up to a few hundred km , where energy transfer is collisionally - dominated , relies largely on modelling .",
    "our understanding of the more extended regions of the coma , where the densities of the species are too low for thermodynamic equilibrium to exist , also relies on modelling .",
    "in particular , models of cometary coma predict the existence of so - called ` solar pumped fluorescent ' ( spf ) h@xmath1o emission lines . these originate from ro - vibrational excited upper states of the molecule , which , if observed in a collisionally - dominated region would be characteristic of kinetic temperatures of several thousand k , but are able to be produced in the cold , rarefied conditions existing in cometary coma , since these excited states , which have relatively large einstein a coefficients , have time to decay radiatively before they are de - excited by collision with another molecule .",
    "despite the success of models in predicting spf lines ( crovisier , 1984 ; weaver and mumma , 1984 , mumma et al . , 1995 ) , the physical conditions existing in cometary coma are highly complex and recent observations of comet tempel 1 ( barber et al .",
    ", 2007 ) revealed a type of emission line , not previously recorded in cometary spectra , and not predicted by the existing cometary models .",
    "these so - called ` sh ' lines originate from upper states that are excited to higher vibrational energies than are the upper states of the spf lines . consequently , their production mechanisms are not able to be explained simply , by the existing cometary models .",
    "the near - earth approach of comet 8p / tuttle in january 2008 , provided an opportunity for us to search for , assign and characterise sh emission lines in its coma .",
    "we believe that our findings , which are presented in this paper , provide the basis for a more thorough investigation of the physical processes involved in the production of sh lines in cometary coma .",
    "8p / tuttle is a short period comet , p@xmath6 = 13.51 yr , and is the parent of the ursid meteor stream ( jenniskens et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "it had been estimated that the comet has a radius of @xmath5 7.5 km , making it the largest of the group of 18 short period comets reported on by licandro et al.(2000 ) .",
    "however radar images obtained on 2 - 4 january 2008 ( harmon et al . , 2008 ) show a bifurcated nucleus consisting of two lobes each 34 km in diameter , suggesting a possible contact binary .",
    "photometric measurements , have yielded rotational times of the nucleus as being either 5.71@xmath70.04 hr ( schleicher and woodney , 2007b ) , 7.7@xmath70.2 hr ( harmon et al . , 2008 ) , or multiplicities of 5.7 and 7.47.6  hr ( drahus et al . , 2008 ) . however",
    ", these results may need to be re - interpreted in the light of the probable bifurcation of the nucleus .    in the scheme proposed by levison ( 1996 )",
    ", comets are classified by reference to the tisserand invariant . to a first order ,",
    "this parameter is a constant of the motion of a comet .",
    "it is based on the jacobi integral in the restricted three - body problem ( tisserand , 1894 ; moulton , 1947 ) . because 8p / tuttle has a tisserand invariant of less than 2 ( t@xmath8 = 1.601 ) , it is classified as a ` near isotropic comet ' ( nic ) of the halley type .",
    "however , its present orbit is not characteristic of this class , since most nic comets have long orbital periods ( defined as being greater than 200 yr ) .",
    "8p / tuttle also differs from most short period comets as these normally have a tisserand invariant 2 @xmath9 t@xmath10 @xmath9 3 and in the levison scheme are referred to as ` ecliptic comets ' ( ec ) .",
    "being a short period nic , the chemistry of 8p / tuttle is of particular interest . unlike most short period comets , which are of the ec type , 8p / tuttle",
    "is believed to have been formed in the region of the giant planets .",
    "it therefore has the potential to reveal possible differences between ec and nic objects . because it has made many approaches to the sun , 8p / tuttle s surface may be highly processed like that of an ec .",
    "if then , despite having a highly - processed surface , its spectra reveal a chemistry that is more like that of nics than of ecs , it may be possible to identify differences in the chemistries of various regions of the very early solar system .    even though , with the exception of the 1953 approach , 8p / tuttle had been seen on each orbit since its discovery in 1858 , until recently there had been no detailed investigation of its near - ir spectrum . during the 2008 apparition , 8p / tuttle approached to within 0.25 au of the earth and",
    "was favourably placed for observing ( see for example , bonev et al . , 2008 and bhnhardt et al . , 2008 )",
    "in the near ir , the spectra of comets are rich in ro - vibrational h@xmath1o emission lines which can , in principle , be observed from earth . however , because of the low temperatures that characterise cometary comae , the strongest water lines are fundamental transitions ( that is to say , transitions to ground vibrational states ) from low - energy ro - vibrational states .",
    "photons from these transitions are absorbed by water vapour in the earth s atmosphere , the molecules of which are in ground vibrational states .    close to the nucleus",
    "the density is sufficiently great ( generally upward of 10@xmath11 molecules @xmath12 ) to ensure that the molecules are collisionally thermalised in low _",
    "j _ ground vibrational states , with a rotational temperature equal to the local kinetic temperature ( weaver and mumma , 1984 ) .",
    "there is no precise boundary between the collisionally - dominated and the less dense , radiatively dominated region , as the breakdown of thermal equilibrium occurs at different distances from the nucleus for each of the allowed rotational transitions between ground vibrational states .",
    "these distances vary between several tens of kilometres to several thousands of kilometres ( bockele - morvan , 1987 ) .",
    "moreover , beyond the region where h@xmath1o ",
    "h@xmath1o collisions are able , alone , to maintain local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) there is a region where the additional contribution of h@xmath1o  electron collisions and line - trapping effects maintains lte to greater radial distances ( bockele - morvan , 1987 ; zakharov et al . , 2007 ) . in particular",
    ", xie  and  mumma ( 1992 ) showed that at distances of several thousand kilometres , e@xmath13h@xmath1o collisions play an important role in exciting water molecules . in section[origins ]",
    "we discuss a number of mechanisms , including e@xmath13h@xmath1o collisions , that may possibly be involved in the formation of the so - called ` sh ' water lines that were observed to be present in our 3 january 2008 ut spectrum of 8p / tuttle .",
    "sh , or ` stochastic heating ' lines were first identified in the ` deep impact ' spectrum of comet tempel  1 ( barber et al . , 2007 ) , and",
    "were subsequently noted to be present in another spectrum of the same comet ( mumma et al . ,",
    "2005 , figure  2 ) .",
    "their characteristics are discussed in section[data_analysis ] .    at distances greater than a few thousand kilometres from the nucleus",
    "the density of the species is sufficiently low , and the mean free path between collisions large enough , for ` fluorescence equilibrium ' to exist .",
    "that is to say , radiation is due to the balance between solar pumping to vibrationally - excited states and subsequent spontaneous radiative decay ( crovisier , 1984 ) . under collisionally - thermalised conditions",
    ", these upper states would typically require temperatures of several thousand kelvin for them to be sufficiently populated for their collisionally - induced radiation to lower states to be observable .",
    "the observation in cometary spectra of transitions from vibrationally - excited upper states , indicates that they must be produced in regions where boltzmann statistics do not apply .    when vibrationally excited states decay radiatively to lower energy ro - vibrational states above the ground vibrational state ( hot bands )",
    ", the photons emitted are not absorbed in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "recognition of this fact was a key factor in developing the ` solar - pumped fluorescent ' ( spf ) approach to analysing cometary spectra ( mumma et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "spectra containing these spf transitions enable information to be derived about the rotational temperature , t@xmath14 of the inner coma and the water production rate , q@xmath15 .",
    "a comparison of this latter value with the production rates of trace species provides the abundance ratios that are fundamental to understanding cometary chemistry .",
    "because the upper states populated by solar pumping are not collisionally thermalised , the derivation of physical quantities from line intensities requires knowledge of all the possible excitation as well as the alternative de - excitation routes .",
    "each upper excited ro - vibrational state can be populated directly by radiative pumping of rotational levels of the ground vibrational state , as well as by cascade from higher energy states ( crovisier , 1984 ) .",
    "the relative probabilities of these various upward and downward routes are temperature - dependent .",
    "models have been developed to compute the _",
    "g_-factors for each spf line , from which line intensities are able to be calculated as a function of temperature ( crovisier , 1984 ; mumma et al . , 1995 , dello russo et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "these models require a knowledge of the einsteina coefficients for the downward transitions .",
    "ideally , the upward pumping rates should be computed using the einstein b coefficients . however , for simplicity , the temperature - dependent vibrational band intensities are frequently used to compute the upward pumping rates . for example , dello russo et al . (",
    "2004 ) used einsteina coefficients from the bt2 synthetic water line list ( barber et al . , 2006 ) to model _",

    "we observed 8p / tuttle on its approach to the sun ( perihelion being on 27 january ut ) , on the nights of 3 , 4 and 5 january 2008 ut from ukirt , hawaii , using the echelle grating on cgs4 .",
    "we report here on the spectra that we obtained on 3 january ut , in the frequency range 3440.63462.6 @xmath0 .",
    "the heliocentric distance on this date was @xmath51.09 au , and the geocentric distance and velocity were @xmath50.25 au and @xmath53.3 km s@xmath4 respectively ; the latter figure corresponds to a red shift of 0.038 @xmath0 , which was equivalent to 1 pixel on the array , and less than the minimum resolution of our instrument , which at r = 37000 was 0.093 @xmath0 at 3450 @xmath0 .",
    "the total visual magnitude of 8p / tuttle at the time of our observations was @xmath55.8 .",
    "however our observations were of the bright inner coma region which presented a point source in our instrument , and required long integration times .",
    "we used a slit of 2-pixel width of length 90 arcsec , oriented east - west .",
    "the scale was 0.86 arcsec per pixel in the spatial direction ( 156 km at the comet ) and 0.41 arcsec in the spectral direction , ( 149 km at the comet for a 2-pixel slit ) .",
    "the telescope was dithered to give 2x2 sampling every 40 seconds .",
    "observations were acquired using a standard abba sequence , which was achieved by nodding the telescope 22 pixels along the slit . in this mode ,",
    "the comet signal was present in both the a and b beams ( rows 114 and 92 respectively ) , which , compared to nodding to blank sky , increased the signal to noise ratio by a factor of @xmath20 , when both signals were added using the ( a - b)-(b - a ) routine to remove the sky .",
    "each abba series represented a total of 160 seconds integration time .",
    "total time on - target was 152 minutes .",
    "spectra of an a0v star , hd 6457 , were obtained at the beginning and end of the observing session .",
    "standard star spectra are required in order to adjust for frequency - dependent atmospheric transmission , and also to enable absolute flux calibration . before dividing by the standard star , we removed high frequency noise from both the 8p / tuttle and standard star data using fourier transform smoothing .",
    "we rejected all data at frequencies where the atmospheric transmission was less than 20% , and this resulted in 19% of the data in the 3440.6 to 3462.6 @xmath0 range being excluded .",
    "we noted that transmission was poor at frequencies less than 3449.0 @xmath0 and above 3460.2 @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore decided to limit the spectral region under investigation to that lying between these frequencies . in this reduced , 11.2 @xmath0 , frequency range less than 3% of the data failed to meet our 20% minimum atmospheric transmission requirement , and the average transmission in this reduced frequency range was 66% .",
    "after dividing by the standard star , flux calibration was achieved by multiplying the result by the frequency - dependent flux of hd 6457 , calculated relative to vega as a photometric 0.0 magnitude standard ( hayes , 1985 ) , and assuming a black body function with _",
    "t_@xmath21  =  9480",
    "k ( tokunaga , 2000 , p151 ) .    because of the lack of arc lines in this spectral region , we frequency - calibrated our data using the position of several known spf lines that were present in the 8p / tuttle spectrum .",
    "this had the effect of transforming the observed spectrum into the rest frame .",
    "the fully - reduced , flux - calibrated spectrum is given in figure  1 .",
    "[ spectrum ]",
    "we compared the features in figure  1 with our bt2 database of h@xmath1o spf line positions and _ g_-factors .",
    "nine of these features are at frequencies corresponding to known spf lines ( there are actually eleven spf lines , with two features being blends of two spf lines ) .",
    "details are given in table[assignments_table ] .",
    "however , figure  1 also includes a number of other features , whose shape and intensity above the continuum ( s / n @xmath222 ) suggest that they are spectral lines , rather than noise , but whose frequencies do not correspond to spf lines .    in order to assign these other features , we employed the methodology detailed in barber et al.(2007 ) for the identification of non - spf features in the post deep impact spectrum of comet tempel  1 .",
    "initially we used the bt2 line list to generate synthetic emission spectra for water at a temperature of 3000 k in the 3449.03462.2 @xmath0 frequency range , restricting the value of _ j _ for the upper state to 8 , and the intensity of the weakest line to be generated was limited to 10@xmath23 of the strongest .",
    "the output , which consisted of about 600 individual lines was convolved to match the resolving power of the cgs4 echelle , r=37000 .    some of the features in this synthetic spectrum are at frequencies corresponding to features in the spectrum of 8p / tuttle",
    ". however , the relative intensities of the features in the observed and synthetic 3000 k spectra do not agree .",
    "the reason is that the observed emission lines originate in low - density regions where vibrationally - excited upper states have sufficient time to decay radiatively before they can be collisionally de - excited .",
    "these upper states are populated by pumping low - lying rotational states and by cascade from higher levels ( of which there will be many , most of which contribute little and can therefore be disregarded ) .",
    "since the water molecules are not collisionally thermalised , the populations of the upper states can be substantially greater than would be the case if boltzmann statistics applied , and the frequencies and intensities of the emissions from these states are frequently similar to those of emission lines from h@xmath1o vapour in lte regions at temperatures of , say , 3000 k.    our synthetic spectrum contains many more features than are present in the spectrum of 8p / tuttle .",
    "it is therefore important to try to identify specific characteristics of the observed lines that differentiate them from lines in the synthetic spectrum that are absent in the observed spectrum .",
    "when synthetic spectra are generated using bt2 , one of the output files gives the frequency , assignment , intensity , einstein a coefficient and lower state energy of every water transition in the frequency range , down to a specified intensity cut - off .",
    "using these data , we were able to identify certain characteristics of those lines in our synthetic spectra whose positions matched those of features in the observed spectrum , that differentiated them from those that did not .",
    "this information enabled us to constrain the parameters applied when generating the bt2 synthetic spectrum , which reduced the number of lines in the synthetic spectrum and hence the risk of confusing noise and real spectral lines .    before detailing these tighter parameters and our findings",
    ", we comment briefly on the ro - vibrational states of water .",
    "the three vibrational modes of the h@xmath1o molecule , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( symmetric stretch , bend and asymmetric stretch respectively ) , require different amounts of energy for one quanta of excitation .",
    "also , the magnitude of each increment decreases as the total internal energy of the excited molecule increases . in the energy range in which we are interested",
    ", each quanta of symmetric and asymmetric stretch represents @xmath53400 - 3700 @xmath0 .",
    "these values are approximately twice the energy of one quanta of bend .",
    "hence it is convenient to talk in terms of ` polyads ' , where each polyad , designated @xmath16 is the equivalent of one quanta of stretch or two of bend .",
    "single bend quanta are denoted by  ` @xmath26 ' .",
    "we noted that all the spf lines in the observed spectrum came from the 2@xmath16 polyad , whilst the large majority of non - spf lines that matched features in our synthetic spectra , were from the 3@xmath16 and 3@xmath16+@xmath26 polyads . we also noted that none of the upper states had more than two @xmath27 quanta .",
    "in addition , the lines in our synthetic spectrum that corresponded to non - spf features in figure  1 all had einstein a coefficients @xmath28 1.0 s@xmath4 , and were on average higher than those of the spf lines , the average a@xmath29 being 23.0 and 7.4  s@xmath4 respectively .",
    "the spf lines had upper states with energies in a very narrow range : 72427613 @xmath0 , whilst the non - spf lines had upper states with energies in the range 10365 12940 @xmath0 .",
    "rotational excitation , also affects which lines are observed in cometary spectra .",
    "this is defined in terms of the asymmetric top labels , @xmath30 which represent total angular momentum and the prolate and oblate levels respectively .",
    "we designate ro - vibrational states ( @xmath31)[@xmath32 and when assigning transitions , give the upper state first .",
    "an examination of the @xmath5 600 transitions in our synthetic spectrum revealed that none of the features in the spectrum of 8p / tuttle corresponded to lines whose upper state had _ j _  @xmath28 5 .",
    "we also noted that none of the lines in our observed spectrum , assigned in table[assignments_table ] , correspond to very weak features in our synthetic spectrum .",
    "they all correspond to lines in our synthetic spectrum having intensities greater than @xmath50.5% of the intensity of the strongest line in the synthetic spectrum . in all of these respects the non - spf lines that we identified in the spectrum of 8p / tuttle had the same characteristics as the sh lines observed in the ` deep impact ' spectrum of comet tempel 1 ( barber et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "this information provided us with with a second , even tighter , set of parameters with which to search for sh lines .",
    "we produced a second synthetic bt2 spectrum with the constraints : _ j _ @xmath9 5 , 3@xmath16 or 3@xmath16+@xmath26 polyad , a@xmath29 @xmath28 1.0 s@xmath4 and a minimum intensity cut - off equivalent to 0.5% of the intensity of the strongest line in the frequency range .",
    "also we lowered the temperature of the synthetic spectrum to 2500 k , which further reduced the total amount of data generated .",
    "although it still includes all the spf lines that were present in our observed spectrum , this second synthetic lte spectrum contains only 26 possible sh lines . using these data",
    ", we were able to assign seven unblended sh lines in the observed spectrum .",
    "these are detailed in table[assignments_table ] , which also gives e@xmath33 , a@xmath29 ; the type of transition , spf or sh ; the nuclear spin species identity ( ortho / para ) and the estimated signal - to - noise ratio of the lines .",
    "in addition to the unblended sh lines , we identified a feature centred at 3458.49 @xmath0 .",
    "there is a known spf line , ( 200)[423]-(100)[432 ] , at 3458.51 @xmath0 .",
    "however , at 62 k , the _ g_-factor for this line is only 8.2@xmath34 , which equates to a line of only @xmath53% of the intensity of the feature observed at 3458.49 @xmath0 .",
    "the bt2 synthetic spectrum contains only one other water line in the 3458.49 @xmath0 region , an sh line , ( 022)[432]-(120)[541 ] at 3458.47 @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore conclude that this line is also present in the observed spectrum of comet 8p / tuttle , which represents an eighth sh detection .",
    "barber _ et al._(2007 ) assigned two unblended sh transitions in the spectrum of comet tempel  1 at 3453.39 and 3451.51 @xmath0 and a feature at 3453.90 @xmath0 which they suggest might be a blend of two lines : ( 211)[322](210)[221 ] , which has a 3@xmath16+@xmath26 polyad upper state , of energy 12354 @xmath0 and ( 103)[110](102)[110 ] , which has a 4@xmath16 polyad upper state of energy 14356.8 @xmath0 .",
    "the spectrum of 8p / tuttle in figure  1 also contains a feature at 3453.90 @xmath0 , and based on the polyad constraints that we detail above , we are inclined to believe that this is the unblended ( 211)[322](210)[221 ] line , and that there is no observable ( 103)[110](102)[110 ] component .",
    "this view is reinforced by considerations of @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( see below ) .",
    "figure  1 also contains a feature ( s / n = 2.1 ) at 3451.51 @xmath0 , which we identify as the ( 220)[212]-(021)[111 ] sh transition , which is in agreement with barber _ et al _ s assignment",
    ". however , there is no feature in our observed 8p / tuttle spectrum at 3453.39 @xmath0 .",
    "this may be because of the width of the strong feature ( a blend of two spf lines ) centred at about 3453.25 @xmath0 , since a line at 3453.39 @xmath0 would be in wing of this feature .",
    "it should also be noted that the line that barber _ et al _ identified in tempel  1 at 3453.39 @xmath0 is the ( 210)[101]-(011)[110 ] transition , whose upper state is of the 2@xmath16+@xmath26 polyad , at an energy of 8784.7 @xmath0 , and hence would not satisfy the 3@xmath16 and 3@xmath16+@xmath26 test that we are applying for sh lines in the current paper .",
    "having identified that the observed spectrum of 8p / tuttle contains eight of the 26 sh lines appearing in table[sh_table ] , we examined the data for additional characteristics that might distinguish the observed eight from the unobserved 18 , and noted one further feature that is common to all the observed sh lines ; they all have @xmath37 @xmath22 @xmath38 - 1 .",
    "now of the 18 lines in table3 that were not observed , half had @xmath37 @xmath22 @xmath38 - 1 , and half did not . moreover , of the nine lines in table[sh_table ] that had @xmath37 @xmath22 @xmath38 - 1 , but which were not identified in the observed spectrum , only the ( 300)[542]-(101)[441 ] transition at 3457.85 @xmath0 , labelled * _ b _ * in table[sh_table ] was definitely absent . adopting a cautious approach",
    "we also include the ( 220)[322]-(120)[413 ] transition at 3452.42 @xmath0 and the ( 003)[440]-(002)[541 ] transition at 3449.64 labelled * _ m _ * and * _ r _ * respectively in table[sh_table ] as being not present even though there is a weak feature in figure1 centred at 3452.48 @xmath0 , which is only 0.06 @xmath0 away from * _ m _ * , and therefore theoretically unresolvable from it , and a 2.1 s / n feature centered at 3449.55 , which would also theoretically be unresolvable from the synthetic sh line * _ r_*. of the remaining six lines in table[sh_table ] that have @xmath37 @xmath22 @xmath38 - 1 , but were not observed to be present in figure1 , two are at frequencies where they would be blended with stronger spf features , and four are at frequencies corresponding to weak features ( s / n @xmath39 2 ) . on this basis , we estimate the probability as 1 in 763 that the property common to all sh lines assigned here ( @xmath40 - 1 ) is a chance event .",
    "we therefore conclude that this characteristic has a physical cause , most probably relating to the mechanism by which sh lines are produced .",
    "we discuss this in more detail in section[origins ] , but comment here that for a given @xmath38 , there are 2@xmath38 + 1 possible combinations of @xmath37 and @xmath41 , and the higher the value of @xmath37 , the higher is the energy of the state .",
    "the preferential population of higher value @xmath37 states is the reverse of what would be observed in a boltzmann distribution , and this inversion of states strongly suggests that the upper levels of sh transitions are populated by cascade from more energetic levels , rather than by pumping from ground vibrational states , which is the principal method of populating the upper states of spf transitions .",
    "in addition to analysing our own 8p / tuttle data , we examined the spectra of comet c/1999 h1 lee obtained on 19 and 21 august 1999 using nirspec on keck ( dello russo et al .",

    "we comment here on the possible origins of the sh lines that we have identified in cometary spectra and which are characterised by upper states of the 3@xmath16 and 3@xmath16+@xmath26 polyad with excited symmetric / asymmetric stretch modes coupled with low bending ( @xmath60 ) and and low rotational ( @xmath61 ) excitation , with only transitions from the more energetic @xmath62 states being observed .",
    "population inversion ( @xmath62 ) suggests that the upper states of the sh transitions are populated by cascade from higher vibrationally - excited states , rather than by pumping from lower levels ( which would preferentially populate high @xmath41 , low @xmath37 states which are at lower energies ( see for example , the three para states of water : ( 300)[440 ] , ( 300)[422 ] and ( 300)[404 ] which have energies , 11048.4 , 10898.1 and 10810.2 @xmath0 , respectively ) . the ladder of downward transitions from an over - populated upper state through progressively lower energy levels is a ` water maser backbone series ' , and is illustrated in figure  1 of cooke and elitzur ( 1985 ) .",
    "the manner in which the highest level of the backbone is populated is an area for further research .",
    "here we mention three possibilities : ( i )  direct excitation by electrons ( ii )  dissociative recombination of h@xmath63o@xmath64 , and ( iii )  photo - dissociation of water with subsequent quenching of o(@xmath44d ) by an h@xmath1o molecule .",
    "xie  and  mumma ( 1992 ) demonstrate that in the case of active comets , electron - water collisions can play an important role in populating the rotational states .",
    "they base their analysis on _ giotto _ measurements of the ion temperatures in the coma of comet halley ( lmmerzahl et al . , 1987 ) and assume the electron temperature is approximately equal to the ion temperature .",
    "the temperature of the electrons rises ( faure et al . , 2004 ) , and hence the cross - section for e@xmath13h@xmath1o collisions declines with distance from the nucleus .",
    "in addition , away from the inner coma , electron density is assumed to fall - off as the inverse square of the nuclear distance .",
    "hence the greatest effect of electron excitation will be within the neutral - neutral collisionally - dominated inner coma , where t@xmath65 @xmath5200 k. however , xie  and  mumma ( 1992 ) show that the rate of e@xmath13h@xmath1o collisions is still significant at distances of 3@xmath6610@xmath67 km from the nucleus , where t@xmath65 is @xmath68 10000 k , which represents energies that are able to excite the 3@xmath16 polyad in the h@xmath1o molecule .",
    "the second process also involves electrons .",
    "the recombination of h@xmath63o@xmath64 ( formed as a result of dissociation of water ) gives rise to h@xmath1o and h with 25% efficiency , and the fragments carry 6.4 ev of excess energy ( jensen et al .",
    "this exceeds the bond energy of h@xmath1o , but it is very likely that a large fraction of the energy is carried by fast h - atoms , leaving the h@xmath1o in bound states that are highly vibrationally excited .",
    "recent experimental work by mann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) on the dissociation of h@xmath18o following charge exchange of h@xmath18o@xmath69 with caesium revealed that h@xmath1o is produced in excited symmetric / asymmetric stretch modes coupled with low bending and rotational excitation .",
    "the fact that the majority of the h@xmath18o@xmath69 ions undergoing dissociative recombination were initially in ground vibrational states with a rotational temperature of 20 - 60 k and that the majority of the available energy is partitioned to h@xmath1o internal energy would appear to have direct parallels with vibrational excitation of h@xmath1o molecules initially in low j , ground vibrational states in the collisionally - dominated region of the cometary inner coma .    in the last of the three processes ,",
    "photolysis of h@xmath1o produces o(@xmath44d ) atoms with a quantum yield of  5% under quiet sun conditions ( huebner et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "o(@xmath44d ) is long lived (  110 s ) , so it can collide with water in the inner coma before radiative relaxation .",
    "about 1.97 ev (  16000 @xmath0 ) is available upon collision , more than enough to excite the 3@xmath16 polyad , and 3@xmath70 polyad .",
    "subsequent vibrational cascade could feed the observed sh lines , but detailed models are needed to evaluate this .",
    "an important issue is the balance between excitation transfer and dissociative reactions .",
    "some laboratory work suggests efficient production of two oh fragments rather than excitation transfer ( dunlea and ravishankara , 2004 ) .",
    "further work is required in order to gain a more complete understanding of the production of sh lines .",
    "this will include more high s / n observations in order to correlate the presence of particular sh lines with parameters such as cometary activity and nucleocentric distance ( i.e. , local density ) and additional laboratory work to understand and quantify the physical processes involved .",

    "<S> high resolution spectra of comet 8p / tuttle were obtained in the frequency range 3449.03462.2 @xmath0 on 3 january 2008 ut using cgs4 with echelle grating on ukirt . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to observing solar pumped fluorescent ( spf ) lines of h@xmath1o , the long integration time ( 152 minutes on target ) enabled eight weaker h@xmath1o features to be assigned , most of which had not previously been identified in cometary spectra . these transitions , which are from higher energy upper states , are similar in character to the so - called ` sh ' lines recorded in the post deep impact spectrum of comet tempel  1 ( barber et al . </S>",
    "<S> , 2007).we have identified certain characteristics that these lines have in common , and which in addition to helping to define this new class of cometary line , give some clues to the physical processes involved in their production . </S>",
