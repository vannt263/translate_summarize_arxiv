    "rotation is a key property of stars that has important consequences for their long term evolution and eventual demise .",
    "rotation is particularly important in massive stars where it contributes significantly to chemical mixing @xcite and may determine the eventual explosion energy and nucleosynthetic yield of the star @xcite . given its importance , it would be extremely beneficial if constraints could be placed on stellar internal rotation as well as on the dominant physical mechanisms responsible for such rotation .",
    "however , theoretically determining the internal rotation of stars is plagued by complicated hydrodynamic processes which are difficult to simulate numerically and until recently , observations have provided little constraint .",
    "fortunately , the observational landscape has recently changed due to space missions like convection , rotation and planetary transits ( corot ) and kepler . with the continuous duty cycle provided by these missions",
    "observers have been able to place constraints on the internal rotation of hundreds of evolved stars using mixed modes @xcite .",
    "the overall consensus of these observations is that angular momentum coupling between the contracting core and envelope is far more efficient than previously expected .",
    "although it is still unclear what the physical mechanism is that causes this efficient coupling , internal gravity waves ( igw ) are a key contender @xcite .",
    "core - envelope differential rotation has also been measured in eight intermediate and massive main sequence stars using both p- and g - modes @xcite .",
    "we note that the term core here is used to mean the region just outside the convective core and is really the inner radiative region . throughout this text",
    "we will use this terminology for consistencies sake but emphasize that `` core '' used here does _ not _ refer to the _ convective _ core .",
    "this handful of observations have shown a variety of differential rotation profiles .",
    "the measurements of hd 157056 @xcite , kic 9244992 @xcite , kic 11145123 @xcite and the binary system kic10080943 @xcite show fairly uniform rotation , although notably not _ exactly _ uniform . on the other hand , hd29248 @xcite and hd129929 @xcite show cores spinning more rapidly than their envelopes .",
    "finally , hd 10526294 @xcite shows an envelope spinning faster than the core and with the opposite direction .",
    "it has been shown previously that igw generated by convection are very efficient at transporting angular momentum @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true in stars which have convective cores and extended overlying radiative regions . in this configuration igw",
    "generated at the convective - radiative interface propagate outward into a region whose density is decreasing dramatically .",
    "this causes wave amplitudes to increase rapidly . because of this increase in amplitude , very small amplitude perturbations at generation can lead to large perturbations in the envelope and therefore , lead to efficient angular momentum transport if the waves dissipate @xcite .",
    "convection generates both prograde and retrograde waves at the convective - radiative interface .",
    "the initial symmetry breaking of a uniformly rotating medium caused by the dissipation of predominantly prograde or retrograde waves at the surface is a stochastic process , meaning the angular momentum transport by igw could either speed up ( if prograde waves are dissipated ) or slow down ( if retrograde waves are dissipated ) the radiative region .    this initial symmetry breaking sets the stage for further angular velocity evolution , which will depend on the dominant dissipation mechanism .",
    "if waves dissipate through nonlinear wave breaking , then subsequent evolution can vary in sign and a strong mean flow may not develop .",
    "if waves dissipate predominantly through radiative dissipation then whichever sign flow dominates initially will grow and eventually reverse in time ( as in the quasi - biennial oscillation @xcite , although it is still unclear whether such an oscillation would proceed in a massive star @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , if a critical layer develops , then any initial mean flow will be amplified , but on a much faster timescale ( than radiative diffusion alone ) . in massive stars",
    "the density stratification is such that waves are likely to non - linearly break .",
    "however , whether or not a critical layer develops will depend on the surface wave flux , which depends on the convective flux , and the details of the stratification .",
    "therefore , the outcome of igw transport can vary from simple efficient angular momentum transport between the convective and radiative regions , to strong differential rotation if a critical layer develops .    while the observed",
    "stars vary in mass they share the common characteristic of having convective cores with overlying radiative regions , albeit with different extent . given the limited number and resolution of the observations , here we use a single fiducial model of a star with a convective core and radiative envelope . by simply varying the initial rotation rate ( to mimic different initial conditions ) and convective flux ( to mimic different masses and ages )",
    "we show that angular momentum transport by convectively driven igw can explain the variety of observed rotation profiles .",
    "to date core - envelope differential rotation has been measured in eight main sequence intermediate and massive stars . here",
    "we briefly summarize those results .",
    "the first measurement of core - envelope differential rotation ( @xmath2 ) in a main sequence star was done by @xcite for the b3v star hd129929 . that star was found to have a core rotating approximately 3.6 times faster than its envelope @xcite .",
    "hd29248 , another b star of similar mass @xcite , was found to have a core spinning approximately 5 times faster than its envelope .",
    "@xcite found a rotation profile consistent with uniform rotation for the @xmath08@xmath1 star hd157056 .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite have found nearly uniform rotation for the f stars kic9244992 and kic11145123 .",
    "though importantly , with high confidence , they find that kic9244992 has an envelope rotating slightly slower than its core ( @xmath3 ) and conversely kic11145123 has an envelope spinning slightly faster than its core ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite constrained core - envelope differential rotation in both components of the binary system kic10080943 and found one object has a slightly faster core than envelope , while the other member shows the opposite .",
    "finally , @xcite used 19 g - mode multiplets to do a full inversion to find the radial differential rotation profile for kic10526294 .",
    "they found that the envelope was spinning significantly faster than the core ( @xmath5 ) but perhaps more surprising , with the opposite sign .",
    "that is , the envelope is rotating in the opposite direction to the core , see fig.[sant ] .    with the exception of @xcite ,",
    "all of these stars only have a measurement of the ratio of @xmath2 and not an actual rotation profile .",
    "these ratios are derived from multiplets of g - modes , which are confined to the region just outside the convection zone , and multiplets of p - modes , which are confined to the surface regions .",
    "therefore , the differential rotation measurement is really a measure of two regions of the star , just outside the convective core and just beneath the surface .",
    "furthermore , mode identification is much easier in slower rotators , therefore , all of the observed stars are slow rotators , perhaps unusually so .",
    "therefore , these observed stars may not represent the rotation profiles of intermediate and massive main sequence stars as a whole .",
    "consequently , in the following we will consider a variety of initial rotation rates .",
    "in order to model angular momentum transport by igw in stellar interiors we solve the navier - stokes equations in the anelastic approximation @xcite .",
    "the equations are solved in two - dimensions ( 2d ) , representing an equatorial slice of the star .",
    "here we use a 3@xmath6 star as a fiducial model .",
    "the radial domain extends from 0.01@xmath7 to 0.90@xmath7 , encompassing both the convective core and radiative envelope to accurately model the convective generation of waves .",
    "the reference state thermodynamic variables are calculated from a polynomial fit to a one - dimensional model calculated using the cambridge stellar evolution code stars for a 3@xmath6 star @xcite , with a central hydrogen fraction , x@xmath8 = 0.47 . at this age",
    "the convective core occupies 0.30@xmath9 or 14% of the radial domain . because of the steep density gradient 90% of the angular momentum of the star resides within 60% of the radius .",
    "these simulations , like all hydrodynamic simulations , require higher than realistic diffusion coefficients for numerical stability ( here we use @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "such diffusion coefficients would damp igw unrealistically on their journey to the surface of the star . to compensate for this enhanced diffusion we force the waves harder by forcing the convection harder so that the waves reach the surface with more realistic amplitudes . forcing",
    "the convection harder leads to convective velocities which are @xmath12 times larger than expected from mixing - length theory , depending on the model .",
    "however , if we compare our simulated surface velocities to those calculated assuming mixing length theory for the convective velocities , proper density stratification and realistic diffusivities , those velocities are comparable .",
    "more details of the numerical model can be found in @xcite .    because the observations span a range of masses , here we consider slightly different convective fluxes as a crude way to mimic different stellar masses and ages .",
    "broadly , we expect higher convective fluxes ( q / c@xmath13 ) to be associated with more massive stars , but given the other details we have neglected , such as varying stratification and age , this is not necessarily the case .",
    "we further consider different rotation rates to mimic different initial conditions .",
    "table 1 lists the initial conditions and parameters of the models considered along with their resulting core - envelope differential rotation .",
    "fig.[snap ] shows a typical time snapshot within the simulated domain of the temperature and vorticity for model m4 .",
    ".model parameters .",
    "@xmath14 is the initial rotation rate given in rad / s .",
    "@xmath15 represents the convective forcing in units k s@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the specific heat at constant volume .",
    "the values 1.5 and 3 result in root mean squared convective velocities of @xmath0 2.9 and 4.5 km s@xmath16 , respectively , values @xmath010 and @xmath020 times larger than predicted by mixing length theory . the differential rotation , @xmath2 , represents the mean ratio of core to envelope rotation . the time and spatial averaging are discussed in the text .",
    "errors quoted are due to variations in time , also discussed in the text .",
    "@xmath18/@xmath19 represents the integrated angular momentum compared to the initial angular momentum content of the system , demonstrating the level at which angular momentum is conserved in the system .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to mimic the regions probed by observations we average the core rotation over @xmath20 outside the convection zone ( @xmath21 ) and the surface rotation over @xmath22 below the surface ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the ratio of these two values varies substantially in time , therefore , to best illustrate the results we show the histogram of values obtained for each model in fig.[histogram ] ( details are in the figure caption ) .",
    "the distribution of values seen in fig.[histogram ] indicates the stochastic nature of wave generation and dissipation .",
    "hence , while most of the profiles are gaussian with a clear average , there is some deviation and skewness .",
    "the values of @xmath2 quoted in table 1 are the mean values with errors of one standard deviation .",
    "the variability due to differences in spatial averaging are smaller than those in time , so long as @xmath21 is measured within the radiative region and away from convective overshoot .",
    "if the core value includes the convection zone , the ratio @xmath24 becomes significantly more variable , tends to increase and its distribution is often not gaussian .",
    "this may be due to inadequate time resolution or reduced dimensionality , but is more likely due to the stochastic nature of turbulent convection .",
    "each of the models is run for at least 20 wave crossing times of the entire radiative envelope for a typical wave ( horizontal wavenumber 10 and frequency 10@xmath25hz ) , or @xmath0 100 convective turnover times , which amounts to @xmath26 .",
    "we note that some models are run substantially longer and do not show substantial variation and certainly none outside the error bars quoted .     for models listed in table 1 .",
    "( a ) low flux , low rotation models m1,m2,m3,m5,m6 .",
    "mean values range from @xmath00.5 to @xmath04 . in general",
    ", these models could explain the rotation measurements of hd129929 , hd29248 , hd157056 , kic9244992 , kic11145123 and kic10080943 .",
    "( b ) low flux , high rotation models m8,m10,m12 . such stars have not yet been observed .",
    "ratios are @xmath01 , igw transport some angular momentum but not so much to bring about substantial differential rotation .",
    "( c ) high flux , low rotation models m5 and m8 . in these models",
    "igw transport significant angular momentum , causing the envelope to spin substantially faster than the core . in these low rotation models ,",
    "negative ratios ( envelope spinning retrograde ) are favored , nicely explaining the observation of @xcite .",
    "( d ) high flux , high rotation models m9,m11 and m13 .",
    "igw transport is efficient enough to cause the envelope to spin faster than the core , so that @xmath27 , but in contrast to the slowly rotating models , these favor positive ( prograde ) surface rotation .",
    "again these stars have yet to be observed.,width=345 ]    in fig.[histogram ] we immediately see that the range of differential rotation profiles seen in the simulations ( @xmath285 ) is similar to that observed ( @xmath295 ) . more specifically , our low flux models with a variety of low rotation rates converge to core - envelope differential rotation values between @xmath0 15 , similar to seven of the eight observations of differential rotation ( hd129929 , hd29248 , hd157056 , kic9244992 , kic11145123 , kic10080943 ) .",
    "these models show a slight preference toward values closer to one than to five , similar to the observations .",
    "simply , we expect hd129929 , hd29248 and hd157056 to be described by high flux rather than low flux models . however , numerous other effects ( such as stratification , brunt - vaisala barrier , etc . - see discussion ) could affect the surface flux of waves contributing to these stars appearing more like low flux models .",
    "low flux , high rotation models also show values very close to one . notably though , the averages are not exactly one . therefore ,",
    "in these low flux models , there is some angular momentum transport by waves but not enough to bring the system significantly away from its initially uniform state .",
    "this is particularly true in faster rotating models , where wave transport is less efficient .",
    "high flux models on the other hand converge to core - envelope differential rotation values generally between @xmath301 . in this case ,",
    "igw are particularly efficient at spinning up ( in amplitude ) the radiative envelopes and hence , envelopes generally spin faster than cores . for slow rotators",
    "this transport is efficient enough and predominantly due to retrograde waves , so that negative values are common . on the other hand , in fast rotators ,",
    "prograde waves dominate and bring about a fast , but positive rotation in the envelope .",
    "it is worth noting that , in general , slow rotators tend to favor retrograde wave deposition at the surface and hence , retrograde envelope rotation , while fast rotators favor prograde wave deposition at the surface and hence , prograde envelope rotation . at the moment , the theoretical reason for this tendency is unknown .    the high flux , slow rotator behavior seen in these simulations is similar to the differential rotation pattern observed in the star kic10526294 @xcite . in fig.[sant ] we show the rotation profile inferred for kic10526294 @xcite , with error bars , along with the time - averaged rotation profile from m4 which was initiated with a rotation rate similar to kic10526294 and which develops a counter - rotating envelope .",
    "there we see that a low rotation model with high igw flux could reproduce the observed rotation profile of kic10526294 .",
    "the outer layers of the star , that are spinning retrograde , represent only @xmath01% of the angular momentum .",
    "therefore , those models which only conserve angular momentum to @xmath02% might not accurately capture the surface dynamics .",
    "however , in this particular case ( m4 ) , the angular momentum is _ larger _ than the original value , so the angular momentum discrepancy can not be explained by the retrograde envelope .",
    "therefore , while we have to be careful when interpreting our surface angular velocities , this likely does nt affect these particular results .",
    "we should note that while our time averaged @xmath24 are similar to observed values it is worth keeping in mind that observations represent an instant in time , not a time average , so any of the values seen in fig.[histogram ] could potentially be observed .",
    "similarly , while we have been able to reproduce the rotation profile of kic10526294 with a time averaged profile , we expect that run long enough , our simulated profile would evolve .",
    "based on these 2d numerical simulations we conclude that igw can explain current observations of core - envelope differential rotation in main sequence stars with a convective core .",
    "these results lead to a few conclusions and predictions .",
    "low flux models with low rotation can show a variety of differential rotation profiles , ranging from @xmath015 .",
    "low flux models with high rotation have rotation profiles closer to uniform , though notably , not exactly .",
    "high flux models with low rotation generally show faster and counter - rotating envelopes .",
    "finally , high flux models of high rotation ( which have not yet been observed ) will have envelopes spinning faster than their core , but with positive sign . in our simulations",
    "the transition between fast and slow rotators ( or retrograde versus prograde envelopes ) occurs @xmath31 rad / s , but this will likely depend on the age and mass of the star .    given that simply changing the convective flux by a factor of two in our simulations can lead to significantly different rotation profiles it is worth discussing what could lead to a different convective flux in a real star , or more appropriately , a different surface wave flux . of course , the first is mass , with higher mass stars having higher luminosities and therefore , higher convective fluxes .",
    "the second is age , as a star evolves its luminosity increases somewhat which could lead to enhanced convective fluxes .",
    "however , as the star ages it also develops a severe gradient in the brunt - vaisala frequency at the convective - radiative interface due to the chemical composition gradient left behind by converting hydrogen to helium .",
    "such a gradient could act as a filter to waves propagating outward to the surface and thus reduce the surface wave flux , possibly causing a massive star to appear more like a low flux model .",
    "it is hard to know how these two effects combined affect the surface wave flux . in reality ,",
    "changes in both mass and age are also accompanied by changes in the stratification throughout the radiative region which could affect the effective propagation and dissipation of waves , and hence the surface wave flux .",
    "any of these effects could contribute to individual stars being better described by different model parameters than initially expected and all of these effects should be considered in future models and as more observations become available .",
    "this work , in addition to @xcite , are some of the first to make direct comparisons between numerical hydrodynamic simulations and observations .",
    "such comparisons clearly require some caveats .",
    "first and foremost , these simulations are carried out in 2d .",
    "we expect that igw transport would be more efficient in 2d as waves are not able to spread out over the sphere and because 2d turbulence has an inverse cascade .",
    "therefore , we expect the timescales of angular momentum transport in these simulations to be shorter than in the actual star , but we can not say by how much .",
    "this difficulty in extrapolating timescales is because mean flow development depends on velocity correlations and it is difficult to say how much more efficient these correlations are in 2d versus 3d .",
    "furthermore , we do not know how wave transport will proceed at higher latitudes but we expect it to be less efficient than at the equator",
    ". therefore , the observations , which represent a latitudinal average , are likely a lower limit of our simulated equatorial differential rotation . finally , treating mass and evolutionary state as simply a change in flux is inadequate .",
    "we have shown that our numerical simulations of igw can explain the observed differential rotation profiles observed in intermediate and massive main sequence stars .",
    "given the shortcomings of these simulations ( 2d , increased viscosity , increased thermal diffusivity ) it is surprising that the results agree as well as they do .",
    "this agreement is likely due to the limited observational constraints and to the fact igw transport can vary significantly . as observational constraints become more numerous , more sophisticated simulations which properly consider mass and age of individual stars and proper dimensionality will be necessary . in turn",
    ", we expect that additional observational constraints can be used to constrain simulation parameters .",
    "one robust conclusion from both the observations and the numerical simulations is that stellar rotation is complex and can admit a variety of profiles .",
    "support for this research was provided by nasa grant nnx13ag80 g to t.rogers .",
    "computing was carried out on pleiades at nasa ames .",
    "t. rogers would like to thank an anonymous referee for insightful and helpful comments which improved this manuscript significantly .",
