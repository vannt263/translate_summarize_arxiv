    "shared entanglement is an essential resource in many quantum information processing applications such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , and quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "these applications generally require that two remote parties maintain a very high degree of entanglement in order for their protocols to work properly .",
    "therefore , the generation of maximally entangled states such as the bell states is an essential task in quantum information science .",
    "however , even if one can initially generate maximally entangled states with ease , they often become non - maximally entangled or partially mixed at the remote locations because of dissipation and decoherence through interactions with the environment .",
    "while each application has its own level of tolerance to entanglement degradation , most applications would be practically unusable without some kind of procedure to restore the degraded entanglement to its initial maximally entangled state .",
    "the need for most quantum information processing applications to overcome unavoidable loss of entanglement has led to several methods for entanglement restoration @xcite .",
    "these techniques typically seek to improve the quality of entanglement between a pair of entangled qubits by selecting , filtering , and applying unique processing algorithms to a larger number of lower quality entangled qubits .",
    "entanglement restoration provides a path to utilizing entangled qubits that would otherwise be dicarded because their entanglement quality is below the threshold necessary for specific applications .",
    "the cost of entanglement restoration is that many pairs of the lower quality entangled qubits must be generated and processed , which requires more resources and longer times for each application processing step .",
    "it is therefore of interest to choose a method that is efficient in terms of resources and processing required to achieve a certain level of entanglement quality . among these methods , schmidt projection ( sp )",
    "@xcite has the interesting property that it can be applied to more than two pairs of entangled qubits at the same time and that the distillation efficiency can approach unity when applied to a large number of initial pairs . despite these advantages ,",
    "schmidt projection is considered difficult to implement because it requires simultaneous collective measurements on multiple qubits .    in this work ,",
    "we illustrate the working principle of schmidt projection @xcite by applying the technique to two pairs of partially entangled qubits .",
    "first , we use the concept of physical mapping to encode the two pairs of entangled qubits into four physically distinguishable states of two hyperentangled photons .",
    "the two photons are entangled in both polarization and momentum degrees of freedom so that the four qubits can be distinguished by their photon , polarization , and momentum . by hosting two qubits per photon carrier ,",
    "we eliminate the problem of bringing the two qubits together to overlap completely in time for quantum logic gate operations . moreover , the two types of qubits can be manipulated deterministically using single - photon two - qubit ( sptq ) quantum logic @xcite .",
    "the sp protocol is carried out efficiently using sptq quantum gates to produce a single maximally - entangled pair of qubits . in sect .",
    "ii we describe the basic idea of the sp protocol and show how this protocol can be implemented with hyperentangled photon pairs .",
    "section  iii describes our experimental implementation including the generation of partially hyperentangled photons and the use of sptq logic to perform the schmidt projection .",
    "the resulting maximally polarization - entangled photons are characterized and the effectiveness and efficiency of the protocol are analyzed and discussed in sect .",
    "iv , and finally we summarize and show how the concept of physical mapping can be applied to trapped - atom and trapped - ion systems .",
    "before we describe how the schmidt projection protocol can be implemented in our experiment , it is useful to clarify the sometimes confusing terminology in entanglement restoration . given one or more pairs of entangled qubits one can extract from them a smaller number of pairs with a higher degree of entanglement ( or the same number of pairs with less than unity probability ) by using local operations and classical communication .",
    "this process of improving the amount of entanglement is called entanglement distillation . in the literature , this process is sometimes called entanglement purification or entanglement concentration . in this work ,",
    "we follow the convention given by ref .",
    "@xcite , in which entanglement purification refers to the process of enhancing the purity of a mixed state by extracting a number of purer entangled states from a larger number of less pure entangled pairs .",

    "we employed hyperentangled photons produced by spontaneous parametric down - conversion to generate pairs of partially - entangled states .",
    "we developed a technique to independently control the amount of entanglement in the polarization ( by pump adjustments ) and momentum ( by crystal temperature ) degrees of freedom of the hyperentangled photon pairs .",
    "this entanglement control capability was utilized to prepare the identical pairs of partially entangled qubits as the initial state for the sp protocol .",
    "schmidt projection on the hyperentangled photon pairs was realized by a pbs and two m - cnot gates , and we used a p - cnot gate to convert the output into a polarization bell state .",

    "we note that schmidt projection can be selectively applied to perform entanglement purification . if classical communication is used to compare the projection results , then certain types of mixed states can be purified , such as @xmath135 , as well as a mixture of two identically decohered pairs @xcite .",

    "therefore the same concept can be applied to other qubit systems such as cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) @xcite or trapped ion @xcite systems , where multiple - qubit product states can be mapped into different internal states within the same atom .",
    "for example , in a cqed system illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cavity](a ) , alice has two trapped atoms each of which is entangled with the corresponding trapped atom in bob s cavity , where the qubits are stored in the ground - state zeeman levels .",
    "consider the case in which the first qubit is stored in @xmath136 and @xmath145 of a@xmath71 ( b@xmath71 ) and the second qubit is in @xmath137 and @xmath146 of a@xmath72 ( b@xmath72 ) on alice s ( bob s ) side as shown in fig .",
    "[ cavity](a ) .",
    "one can coherently transfer the quantum states stored in alice s two atoms completely to a@xmath72 while leaving a@xmath71 in @xmath136 by adiabatic passage via a dark state of the two - atom + cavity system @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath147 when @xmath148 is in a binary representation . by mapping all four possible quantum states into four internal states of a@xmath72 ,",
    "the undesirable states such as @xmath137 or @xmath138 can be eliminated by driving the cycling transitions from the undesirable states to an auxiliary state ( not shown in the level structure ) @xcite , and the process can be confirmed by the induced fluorescence .",
    "if no fluorescence is observed , we can conclude that schmidt projection has successfully taken place .    in the trapped - ion case",
    ", one can use the quantized center - of - mass vibrational mode ( ` bus mode ' ) in a similar way as in the cqed case .",
    "when there are two ions , the electronic state of the first ion can be transferred to the bus mode @xcite with a red - sideband transition , and this bus mode can be transferred to the second ion while mapping four different two - qubit states to four distinct internal states of the second ion .",
    "the rest of the procedure is similar to the cqed case .",
    "we believe that further studies of schmidt - projection implementations in atoms and ions and for mixed states should enhance our expanding collection of tools in quantum information science .",
