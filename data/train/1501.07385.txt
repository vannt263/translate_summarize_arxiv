    "the primary goal of tomography is to determine the internal structure of an object without cutting it , namely using data obtained by methods that leave the object under investigation undamaged .",
    "these data can be obtained by exploiting the interaction between the object and various kinds of probes including x - rays , electrons , and many others .",
    "after its interaction with the object under investigation , the probe is detected to produce what we call a projected distribution or tomogram , see fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] .",
    "tomography is a rapidly evolving field for its broad impact on issues of fundamental nature and for its important applications such as the development of diagnostic tools relevant to disparate fields , such as engineering , biomedical and archaeometry .",

    "the reconstruction problem can be formulated as follows : one wants to recover an unknown function through the knowledge of an appropriate family of integral transforms .",
    "it was proved by j. radon  @xcite that a smooth function @xmath0 on @xmath1 can be determined explicitly by means of its integrals over the lines in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the integral of @xmath3 along the line @xmath4 ( tomogram )",
    ". then    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the laplacian on @xmath1 , and its square root is defined by fourier transform ( see theorem  [ thm : inversioneformula ] ) .",
    "we now observe that the formula above has built in a remarkable duality : first one integrates over the set of points in a line , then one integrates over the set of lines passing through a given point .",
    "this formula can be extended to the @xmath7-dimensional case by computing the integrals of the function @xmath3 on all possible hyperplanes .",
    "this suggests to consider the transform @xmath8 defined as follows .",
    "if @xmath3 is a function on @xmath9 then @xmath10 is the function defined on the space of all possible @xmath11-dimensional planes in @xmath9 such that , given a hyperplane @xmath12 , the value of @xmath13 is given by the integral of @xmath3 along @xmath12 .",
    "the function @xmath10 is called _ radon transform _ of @xmath3 .",
    "there exist several important generalizations of the radon transform by john @xcite , gelfand @xcite , helgason @xcite and strichartz @xcite .",
    "more recent analysis has been boosted by margarita and volodya manko and has focused on symplectic transforms @xcite , on the deep relationship with classical systems and classical dynamics @xcite , on the formalism of star product quantization @xcite , and on the study of marginals along curves that are not straight lines @xcite .    in quantum mechanics",
    "the radon transform of the wigner function @xcite was considered in the tomographic approach to the study of quantum states @xcite and experimentally realized with different particles and in diverse situations . for",
    "a review on the modern mathematical aspects of classical and quantum tomography see  @xcite .",
    "good reviews on recent tomographic applications can be found in  @xcite and in  @xcite , where particular emphasis is given on maximum likelihood methods , that enable one to extract the maximum reliable information from the available data can be found .",
    "as explained above , from the mathematical point of view , the internal structure of the object is described by an unknown function @xmath3 ( density ) , that is connected via an operator to some measured quantity @xmath14 ( tomograms ) .",
    "the tomographic reconstruction problem can be stated as follows : for given data @xmath14 , the task is to find @xmath3 from the operator equation @xmath15 .",
    "there are many problems related to the implementation of effective tomographic techniques due to the instability of the reconstruction process .",
    "there are two principal reasons of this instability .",
    "the first one is the ill - posedness of the reconstruction problem : in order to obtain a satisfactory estimate of the unknown function it is necessary an extremely precise knowledge of its tomograms , which is in general physically unattainable  @xcite .",
    "the second reason is the discrete and possibly imperfect nature of data that allows to obtain only an approximation of the unknown function .",
    "the first question is whether a partial information still determines the function uniquely .",
    "a negative answer is given by a theorem of smith , solomon and wagner  @xcite , that states : `` a function @xmath3 with compact support in the plane is uniquely determined by any infinite set , but by no finite set of its tomograms '' .",
    "therefore , it is clear that one has to abandon the request of uniqueness in the applications of tomography .",
    "thus , due to the ill - posedness of reconstruction problem and to the loss of uniqueness in the inversion process , a regularization method has to be introduced to stabilize the inversion .",
    "a powerful approach is the introduction of a mumford - shah ( ms ) functional , first introduced in a different context for image denoising and segmentation  @xcite .",
    "the main motivation is that , in many practical applications , one is not only interested in the reconstruction of the density distribution @xmath3 , but also in the extraction of some specific features or patterns of the image .",
    "an example is the problem of the determination of the boundaries of inner organs . by minimizing the ms functional",
    ", one can find not only ( an approximation of ) the function but also its sharp contours .",
    "very recently a ms functional for applications to tomography has been introduced in the literature  @xcite .",
    "some preliminary results in this context are already available but there are also many interesting open problems and promising results in this direction , as we will try to explain in the second part of this article .    the article is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : radon ] contains a short introduction to the radon transform , its dual map and the inversion formula .",
    "section  [ sec : ill ] is devoted to a brief discussion on the ill - posedness of the tomographic reconstruction and to the introduction of regularization methods . in section",
    "[ sec : ms ] a ms functional is applied to tomography as a regularization method . in particular , in subsection  [ subsec : ms ] the piecewise constant model and known results are discussed together with a short list of some interesting open problems .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:3dinterpretation ] we present an electrostatic interpretation of the regularization method based on the ms functional , which motivates us to introduce an improved regularization method , based on the blake - zisserman functional  @xcite , as a relaxed version of the previous one .",
    "consider a body in the plane @xmath1 , and consider a beam of particles ( neutrons , electrons , x - rays , etc . ) emitted by a source .",
    "assume that the initial intensity of the beam is @xmath16 .",
    "when the particles pass through the body they are absorbed or scattered and the intensity of the beam traversing a length @xmath17 decreases by an amount proportional to the density of the body @xmath18 , namely @xmath19 so that @xmath20 a detector placed at the exit of the body measures the final intensity @xmath21 and then from @xmath22 one can record the value of the density @xmath18 integrated on a line . if another ray with a different direction is considered , with the same procedure one obtains the value of the integral of the density on that line .",
    "the mathematical model of the above setup is the following : given a smooth function @xmath23 on the plane , @xmath24 , and a line @xmath12 , consider its tomogram , given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the euclidean measure on the line @xmath12 . in this way",
    ", we have defined an operator @xmath27 that maps a smooth function @xmath3 on the plane @xmath1 into a function @xmath10 on @xmath28 , the manifold of the lines in @xmath1 .",
    "we ask the following question : if we know the family of tomograms @xmath29 , can we reconstruct the density function @xmath3 ?",
    "the answer is affirmative and in the following we will see how to obtain this result .",
    "let us generalize the above definitions to the case of an @xmath7-dimensional space .",
    "let @xmath3 be a function defined on @xmath9 , integrable on each hyperplane in @xmath9 and let @xmath30 be the manifold of all hyperplanes in @xmath9 .",
    "the radon transform of @xmath3 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ sharp lambda ] ) , where @xmath26 is the euclidean measure on the hyperplane @xmath12 .",
    "thus we have an operator @xmath27 , the _ radon transform _ , that maps a function @xmath3 on @xmath9 into a function @xmath10 on @xmath31 , namely @xmath32 .",
    "its dual transform , also called _ back projection operator _ , @xmath33 associates to a function @xmath14 on @xmath31 the function @xmath34 on @xmath9 given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the unique probability measure on the compact set @xmath37 which is invariant under the group of rotations around @xmath38 .     using its signed distance @xmath39 from the origin and a unit vector @xmath40 perpendicular to @xmath12.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    let us consider the following covering of @xmath30 @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the unit sphere in @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the equation of the hyperplane @xmath12 is @xmath43 with @xmath44 denoting the euclidean inner product of @xmath45 .",
    "[ fig : radon nd ] . observe that the pairs @xmath46 are mapped into the same hyperplane @xmath47 . therefore ( [ double covering ] ) is a double covering of @xmath30 .",
    "thus @xmath30 has a canonical manifold structure with respect to which this covering mapping is differentiable .",
    "we identify continuous ( differentiable ) functions @xmath14 on @xmath30 with continuous ( differentiable ) functions @xmath14 on @xmath48 satisfying @xmath49 .",
    "we will momentarily work in the schwartz space @xmath50 of complex - valued rapidly decreasing functions on @xmath9 .",

    "now we want to obtain an inversion formula , namely we want to prove that one can recover a function @xmath3 on @xmath9 from the knowledge of its radon transform . in order to get this result",
    "we need a preliminary lemma , whose proof can be found in  @xcite , which suggests an interesting physical interpretation .",
    "[ sharp flat ] let @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",

[",
    "fig : potential ] .",
    "notice , however , that the potential of a point charge scales always as the inverse distance _ independently _ of the dimension @xmath7 , and thus it is coulomb only for @xmath69 .",
    "the only dependence on @xmath7 is in the strength of the elementary charge @xmath65 .",
    "this fact is crucial : indeed , the associated poisson equation involves an @xmath7-dependent ( fractional ) power of the laplacian , which appears in the inversion formula for the radon transform .",
    "[ thm : inversioneformula ] let @xmath60 .",
    "then @xmath70 where @xmath71 , with @xmath72 , is a pseudodifferential operator whose action is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the fourier transform of @xmath3 , @xmath75    the proof of theorem  [ thm : inversioneformula ] can be found in  @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ inversion formula0 ] ) says that , modulo the final action of @xmath76 , the function @xmath3 can be recovered from its radon transform @xmath10 by the application of the dual mapping @xmath77 : first one integrates over the set of points in a hyperplane and then one integrates over the set of hyperplanes passing through a given point .",
    "explicitly we get @xmath78 which has the following remarkable interpretation .",
    "note that if one fixes a direction @xmath79 , then the function @xmath80 is constant on each plane perpendicular to @xmath40 , i.e.  it is a ( generalized ) plane wave .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ inversion formula ] ) gives a representation of @xmath3 in terms of a continuous superposition of plane waves .",
    "a well - known analogous decomposition is given by fourier transform .",
    "when @xmath81 , one recovers the inversion formula  ( [ eq : radoninversion ] ) originally found by radon @xcite .",
    "we have defined the radon transform of any function @xmath82 as @xmath10 .",

    "moreover , the radon operator @xmath27 can be extended to a continuous operator from @xmath83 and @xmath91 .    in medical imaging ,",
    "computerized tomography is a widely used technique for the determination of the density @xmath3 of a sample from measurements of the attenuation of x - ray beams sent through the material along different angles and offsets .",
    "the measured data @xmath14 are connected to the density @xmath3 via the radon transform @xmath92 . to compute the density distribution @xmath3 the equation @xmath93 has to be inverted .",
    "unfortunately it is a well known fact that @xmath27 is not continuously invertible on @xmath91  @xcite , and this imply that the problem of inversion is ill - posed .",
    "for this reason , regularization methods have to be introduced to stabilize the inversion in the presence of data noise .",

    "the original mumford - shah functional  @xcite , is the following : @xmath121 where    * @xmath122 is an open set ( _ screen _ ) ; * @xmath123 is a closed set ( _ set of edges _ ) ; * @xmath124 ( _ cartoon _ ) ; * @xmath125 denotes the distributional gradient of @xmath126 ; * @xmath127 is the datum ( _ digital image _ ) ; * @xmath128 are parameters ( _ tuning parameters _ ) ; * @xmath129 denotes the @xmath11-dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "the squared @xmath130 distance in ( [ defn : jms ] ) plays the role of a fidelity term : it imposes that the cartoon @xmath126 approximate the image @xmath14 . the second term in the functional imposes that the cartoon @xmath126 be piecewise smooth outside the edge set @xmath120 . in other word",
    "this term favors sharp contours rather than zones where a thin layer of gray is used to pass smoothly from white to black or viceversa .",

    "now we consider a measured tomogram @xmath212 and let us assume that @xmath213 for some @xmath214 . by lemma [ lemma : normrf]-[lemma : electricfield ]",
    "it follows immediately that the fidelity term @xmath215 can be rewritten as follows : @xmath216 where @xmath217 are the corresponding electric fields , while @xmath218 are the corresponding potentials .    with respect to the standard mumford - shah functional @xmath134 in ( [ defn : jms ] ) , the new fidelity term in the functional @xmath139 in ( [ def : msfunctional ] ) controls the distance between the radon transform of @xmath3 and the tomographic data @xmath14 .",
    "the relevant difference with respect to the original functional is that the function @xmath3 and its radon transform @xmath10 are defined in different spaces .",
    "let us try to interpret the fidelity term @xmath219 from a physical point of view .",
    "a key ingredient for this goal is the electrostatics formulation of the radon transform .",
    "this formulation can be summarized as follows : if we consider , in dimension @xmath199 , a function @xmath3 , we can think at it as a charge distribution density ; if we apply to @xmath3 first the radon operator @xmath27 and then its adjoint @xmath77 we obtain , up to a constant , the electrostatic potential generated by the charge distribution @xmath3 .",
    "this formulation can be stated in any dimension @xmath7 : the difference with general potential theory in dimension @xmath7 is that , in tomography , the potential produced by a point charge always scales like @xmath220 , which is the case of electrostatic potential only in dimension @xmath199 . from the electrostatic formulation of the radon",
    "transform we can prove that the fidelity term in the functional @xmath139 actually imposes that the electric field produced by the charge distribution @xmath3 must be close to the `` measured electric field '' . therefore we conclude that the term @xmath221 is a fidelity term in this weaker sense .    using this property based on the electrostatic interpretation of the tomographic reconstruction",
    ", we can try to minimize some appropriate functionals in the new variables @xmath222 ( electric field ) or @xmath223 ( electric potential ) and then compute the corresponding @xmath3 ( charge density ) .",
    "we manipulate the functional @xmath139 as follows : @xmath224 where @xmath225 is a new functional depending on a vector function @xmath222 and on a set @xmath120 , and we used the fact that @xmath226 , since @xmath222 is conservative .",
    "we observe that the functional @xmath227 is a second order functional for a vector field @xmath222 in which appears the measure of the set @xmath120 that is the set of discontinuities of @xmath3 and thus is the set of discontinuities of @xmath228 . in the functional @xmath225",
    "we recognize some similarities with a famous second - order free - discontinuity problem : the blake - zisserman model .",
    "this model is based on the minimization of the blake - zisserman functional @xmath229 among admissible triplets @xmath230 , where    * @xmath122 is an open set ; * @xmath231 are closed sets ; * @xmath232 is the set of discontinuities of @xmath233 ( jump set ) , and @xmath234 the the set of discontinuities of @xmath235 ( crease set ) ; * @xmath236 , @xmath237 is a scalar function ; * @xmath238 denotes the distributional laplacian of @xmath233 ; * @xmath239 is the datum ( grey intensity levels of the given image ) ; * @xmath240 are parameters ; * @xmath129 denotes the @xmath11-dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "the blake - zisserman functional allows a more precise segmentation than the mumford - shah functional in the sense that also the curvature of the edges of the original picture is approximated . on the other hand ,",
    "minimizers may not always exist , depending on the values of the parameters @xmath241 and on the summability assumption on @xmath242 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for motivation and analysis of variational approach to image segmentation and digital image processing .",
    "in particular see @xcite for existence of minimizer results and @xcite for a counterexample to existence and @xcite for results concerning the regularity of minimizers .",
    "equation  ( [ eqnaeeay_manipulation ] ) implies that the functional @xmath139 can be rewritten in terms of the vector field @xmath222 and of the discontinuities set of @xmath228 , i.e. the set of creases of @xmath222 , using the terminology of the blake - zisserman model . the fact that in the functional @xmath225 the discontinuities set of @xmath222 is not present depends on the fact that we are assuming that the charge density @xmath3 in the functional @xmath139 do not concentrate on surfaces or on lines .",
    "if we admit concentrated charge layers we can consider the blake - zisserman model for the vector function @xmath222 as a relaxed version of the mumford - shah model for the charge @xmath3 .",
    "in other words we propose to investigate the connections between minimizers of @xmath139 and minimizers of the higher order functional @xmath243 : @xmath244 with the additional constraint @xmath245 .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that the functional @xmath243 is a purely differential functional , while the functional @xmath139 is an integro - differential one .",
    "we expect that some results about the blake - zisserman model that could be rephrased into tomographic terms would provide immediately new results in tomography .",
    "conversely all the peculiar tomographic features as the intrinsic vector nature of the variable @xmath222 , the fact that its support can not be bounded and the extra - constraint @xmath246 , motivate new research directions in the study of free - discontinuities problems .",
    "for example , an interesting result in this context would be the determination of a good hypothesis on the datum @xmath247 that ensure that the charge density @xmath3 do not concentrate .",
    "we conclude this section with some comments :    * we proved that the measured data @xmath14 are actually the measured electric field produced by the unknown charge density , so the term @xmath200 in the functional is a fidelity term in a weak sense .",
    "* the problem of the reconstruction of the charge can be rephrased into a reconstruction problem for the electric field .",
    "the electric field is an irrotational vector field , so the new minimization problem is actually a constrained minimization . in order to avoid this constraint",
    "one could reformulate the reconstruction problem in terms of the electric potential @xmath223 ( @xmath248 ) obtaining a third - order functional in which the fidelity term is @xmath249 where the potentials are given by  ( [ eq : potentials ] ) . * all this",
    "considerations hold true in dimension  @xmath199 . in a generic dimension",
    "@xmath250 the situation is quite different because the inversion formula for the radon transform involves a ( possibly fractional ) power of the laplacian . in this case",
    "the electrostatic description of tomography given in this section fails . in order to restore it",
    ", it is necessary to consider another radon - type transform which involves integrals of @xmath3 over linear manifolds with codimension @xmath251 such that @xmath252 , i.e. @xmath253 , see e.g. @xcite .",
