    "in a series of works david nelson and collaborators  @xcite investigated the extinction versus survival of bacterial colonies undergoing convection in a medium with heterogeneous distribution of nutrients .",
    "space is divided into an``oasis '' , with high nutrients , and a  desert \" with low nutrients .",
    "the above model is similar to models used in mathematical epidemiology in which a population is divided into subpopulations  ( patches ) and disease - causing factors are non - uniformly distributed across patches  @xcite .",
    "nelson @xmath0 @xmath1 solved the kolmogorov - fisher equation ( kfe ) with a convective term , using its similarity to a nonlinear schr@xmath2dinger equation with a non - hermitian perturbation  @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum of this equation has a diverging localization length with a sharp mobility edge .",
    "this mobility edge is identified with the fisher velocity , the speed of propagation in the kfe .",
    "this means that while at high convection velocity all bacteria are transported into the desert and become extinct , at low velocity the surviving population is localized near the oasis . if the desert can support a non - zero steady state population extinction is replaced by a delocalized steady state .",
    "it is tempting to consider the continuum deterministic equations of nelson @xmath0 @xmath1  @xcite as a coarse grained description of a more microscopic stochastic model of this system  @xcite .",
    "a potential candidate for such a model is a generalized contact process  ( cp ) on a lattice which includes both drift and spatial heterogeneity . using monte carl simulations , we find that this stochastic model does in fact have a phase diagram which is qualitatively similar to that obtained from nelson s deterministic continuum approach . various transitions between phases ( extinct , localized and delocalized ) are identified .",
    "stochastic modeling of the discrete microscopic space - time events underlying the type of physical phenomena considered in  @xcite raises many conceptual and methodological questions .",
    "these are further complicated by the practical limitations of computer simulations  the size of the system , the time it can be followed and the number of samples are all strictly limited and are generally small compared to the macroscopic space - time scales of the physical phenomena .",
    "experience nevertheless indicates that judicious microscopic modeling , which requires choosing system sizes and simulation times large enough to well represent `` typical '' behavior plus `` normal '' fluctuations , can add to our understanding of the macroscopic phenomena  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the simulation time must not be too large so as to avoid rare events such as extinction of populations , which will always occur eventually in finite systems .",
    "these , however , occur on a time scale that grows exponentially with the size of the system and so will almost never be seen at intermediate time scales .",
    "we do not attempt here any deep analysis of these important issues but refer to the literature @xcite .",
    "the more modest goal of this paper is to investigate the effect of locomotion with drift , in an inhomogeneous spatial environment , on the behavior of the stochastic contact process .",
    "this is a frequently used model for population dynamics , spread of epidemics , etc .",
    "we consider in particular an environment consisting of a single oasis surrounded by a patch of desert several times the size of the oasis . by using periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "this is equivalent to considering a periodic array of such patches which , quite unrealistically , are microscopically identical .",
    "we first describe the basic contact process with additional spatial jumps and find that these jumps have the effect of destroying correlations .",
    "this brings the system closer to its mean field behavior .",
    "we then investigate the oasis - desert system in one and two dimensions .",
    "hydrodynamical scaling which connects this stochastic model to continuum deterministic models is discussed briefly .",
    "the contact process  ( cp ) is frequently used to model population dynamics where the population lives on the @xmath3-dimensional cubic lattice @xmath4  @xcite . at each site @xmath5 of the lattice",
    "there is an organism which can exist in one of two states @xmath6 : we will refer to @xmath7 as dead or @xmath8 as alive .",
    "let @xmath9 be the variable which specifies the state at a site @xmath5 of a @xmath3-dimensional simple cubic lattice @xmath10 and let @xmath11 , @xmath12 , be the configuration of the system at some given time .",
    "the stochastic dynamics of the process are specified by the following rates : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of neighbors of site @xmath5 .",
    "equivalently , a live site dies at rate @xmath15 or attempts to give birth to a new bacterium on a randomly chosen neighboring site at rate @xmath16 .",
    "it succeeds if that site is empty , otherwise nothing happens .",
    "we are assuming here for simplicity that the birth rate is spatially uniform , although of course one might expect both to depend on local conditions .",
    "in particular one expects higher birth rates in the oasis than in the desert .",
    "what is most important , however , is just the ratio of birth rate to death rate , hence the effect we are modeling should be essentially captured by just considering variations in the latter .    as there must be at least one live site to propagate ,",
    "the all - zero state is absorbing ,",
    "i.e. , if @xmath17 for all @xmath5 at any time @xmath18 it will stay like that forever  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath19 is constant , the evolution depends only on the ratio @xmath20 . for large @xmath20 a live population can survive .",
    "as @xmath20 decreases there is a transition from survival to extinction at a critical value of this ratio which depends on the dimension @xmath3 of the lattice . in units of @xmath21 , @xmath22 in one - dimension and @xmath23 on the square lattice  @xcite .    in the mean field approximation ,",
    "corresponding to the neglect of correlations between different sites , one can write a deterministic equation for the density of live sites . thus , for the spatially homogeneous case , with density @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 starting with some non zero density @xmath26 the long time solution of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) is @xmath27 if @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , if @xmath30 , and so @xmath31 .",
    "this shows in particular that @xmath32 for @xmath33 ( or indeed for any finite @xmath3 ) .",
    "this can be understood by noting that correlations between live ( occupied ) sites are positive for the contact process in the stationary state , i.e. : @xmath34 .",
    "thus correlations inhibit growth , since live sites give birth only on unoccupied neighboring sites .",
    "we now add to the cp a mechanism for the movement of the bacteria via a kawasaki exchange kinetics  @xcite .",
    "this permits a bacterium at site @xmath5 to move ( jump ) to a neighboring site @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the exchanges conserve the total number of individuals in the system .",
    "these two processes can be considered as follows .",
    "a clock at each live site @xmath5 rings at a rate 1 , i.e. , the probability that it will ring in a very small time interval @xmath37 is equal to @xmath37 .",
    "when it rings the bacterium at that site attempts to jump to a neighboring site with probability @xmath38 , dies with probability @xmath39 , or attempts to give birth to a bacterium on a randomly chosen neighboring site with probability @xmath40 , and with probability @xmath41 $ ] nothing happens .",
    "the constant @xmath42 is chosen as small as possible to make all probabilities non - negative , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "we note further that if the bacteria decides to jump or give birth on a neighboring site which is already occupied , nothing happens .    if a jump is decided upon , the appropriate neighboring site is chosen as follows : in one dimension a bacterium at site @xmath5 attempts to jump to the site @xmath44 with probability @xmath45 and to the site @xmath46 with probability @xmath47 , @xmath48 . in two dimensions",
    "the symmetry of the kawasaki exchanges along the @xmath35 axis is broken while the exchanges along the @xmath5 axis are symmetric .",
    "a bacterium at site @xmath49 attempts to jump to site @xmath50 with probability @xmath51 and to site @xmath52 with probability @xmath53 while it tries to jump to site @xmath54 and to site @xmath55 with equal probability @xmath56 . when @xmath57 there is a drift to the right or up ( left or down for @xmath58 ) .",
    "in all cases jumps succeed if the target site is empty , otherwise nothing happens .    when @xmath59 particles jump in each direction with equal probability .",
    "this corresponds to a symmetric stirring . for constant @xmath60 and @xmath59",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the limit , @xmath61 one can rescale space and time appropriately to obtain rigorously a continuum reaction - diffusion equation for the density . a space time - scaling ,",
    "leading to a reaction - diffusion equation with drift holds also for @xmath62 ; see section vi .",
    "this means that when the jumps become very frequent they destroy the correlations between sites .",
    "subsequently the critical value of @xmath63 assumes its mean - field value in this limit .    in general the configuration probability distribution , @xmath64 ,",

    "we carried out monte carlo simulations of the contact process with a homogeneous death rate , @xmath21 , and with symmetric kawasaki exchanges for various jump probabilities @xmath38 .",
    "the system was a ring containing 50 , 100 , 200 , 300 , 500 sites ( with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
