    "in a one page pioneering paper @xcite and a book @xcite , strogatz suggested a simple pedagogical model describing a love affair .",
    "his goal was to teach harmonic oscillation phenomena using `` a topic that is already on the minds of many college students : the time - evolution of a love affair between two people '' .",
    "later , rinaldi , gragnani , and feichtinger proposed more realistic mathematical models for love dynamics @xcite : they showed that dynamic phenomena in the field of social science can also be analyzed by using a modeling approach via ordinary differential equations .",
    "their models explained that two individuals , who are completely indifferent to each other from the start , approach a plateau of love affair .",
    "they also showed that the coexistence of insecurity and synergism results in a cyclic dynamics of romantic feelings .",
    "secure individuals react positively to their partner s love and are not afraid about their partner becoming emotionally close to them while non - secure ones react negatively to high involvement @xcite .",
    "synergic individuals are those who increase their reactions to their partner s appeal when they are in love @xcite .",
    "thereafter , following a suggestion of strogatz , sprott investigated the dynamics of a love triangle , which produce a chaotic behavior @xcite , and suggested dynamical models of happiness @xcite . moreover , wauer et al .",
    "studied the love dynamics for time - varying fluctuations @xcite .",
    "very recently , rinaldi et al . constructed full catalog of possible love stories among two individuals @xcite , and barley and cherif studied the stochastic love dynamical model @xcite .    on the other hand , a dynamical model described by using delay differential equations ( ddes ) has attracted much attention in various fields of science , e.g. , biology @xcite , chemistry @xcite , neural systems @xcite , excitable systems @xcite , transport control @xcite and cryptography @xcite .",
    "ddes also support a realistic mathematical modeling of economic dynamics @xcite . in the field of social science , liao and ran recently showed that the time delay on love dynamics can cause a hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "however , they did not consider the linear , secure , and non - secure returns .",
    "also , they did not deal with the synergic instinct . for that reason , they could not clarify the condition for the occurrence of hopf bifurcation .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of time delay on the nonlinear dynamical model describing a love affair between two individuals . by analyzing the characteristic equation of linearization of the model",
    ", we theoretically prove that if no one exhibits a non - secure return in both cases of synergic and non - synergic couples , then the existence of time delay can not disturb a plateau of love affair , i.e. , steady state .",
    "however , if at least one of them has a non - secure return , then the time delay on return function can cause a hopf bifurcation and a cyclic love dynamics . on the other hand , through numerical bifurcation analysis , we confirm the theoretical results on hopf bifurcation and investigate additional bifurcation phenomena . as a result , we obtain a universal bifurcation structure consisting of a supercritical hopf and a cascade of period - doubling bifurcations , resulting in chaotic motion for our models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec:2 ] presents the love dynamical model . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we prove the occurrence of hopf bifurcation by using a local stability analysis . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we show the results of our numerical bifurcation analysis .",
    "the conclusion is given in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "now , let us investigate the love dynamical model based on a series of models proposed by rinaldi , gragnani , and feichtinger @xcite .",
    "the model has a variable @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , which is a measure of the love of an individual @xmath2 for his or her partner @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "positive values of @xmath0 represent love while negative values are associated with hate .",
    "complete indifference is identified by @xmath5 .",
    "it is important to mention the time scale of the love dynamical model .",
    "fast fluctuations of the feelings influenced by daily or weekly activities can not be captured by the model .",
    "also , the learning and the adaptation processes over a long range of time are not considered .",
    "thus , the following model can only be used on an intermediate time scale ( months / years ) , for example , in predicting if a love story will be characterized by stationary or stormy feelings @xcite .    the dynamics of love is comprised of three basic processes : oblivion @xmath6 , return @xmath7 and instinct @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9    in the following , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are replaced by @xmath0 and @xmath12 for compact notation .",
    "oblivion is described by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is a forgetting coefficient .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 decays exponentially when an individual @xmath2 loses partner @xmath3 ( @xmath15 ) .    the return @xmath7 is related to the reaction of individual @xmath2 to the partner s love @xmath12 .",
    "three different types of return functions have been considered , namely , the linear return @xmath16 , the secure return @xmath17 , and the non - secure return @xmath18 .",
    "the simplest one is the linear return @xcite given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a reactiveness to the love .",
    "it is unbounded and describes that an individual @xmath2 `` loves to be loved '' and `` hates to be hated '' .",
    "the secure return @xcite is specified by    @xmath21    it is an increasing and bounded function , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1.eps](a ) .",
    "secure individuals react positively to their partner s love and are not afraid about their partner becoming emotionally close to them .",
    "however , non - secure individuals react negatively to high pressures and involvement , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1.eps](b ) .",
    "the non - secure return @xcite is described by    @xmath22    , ( b ) non - secure return @xmath23 , and ( c ) synergic function @xmath24.,width=359 ]    the instinct @xmath8 is related to the reaction of individual @xmath2 to the partner s appeal @xmath25 . in the following ,",
    "we only consider positive appeal @xmath25 .",
    "two different types of instinct functions have been suggested , namely the synergic instinct @xmath26 and non - synergic instinct @xmath27 .",
    "the non - synergic instinct @xcite is given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a reactiveness to the appeal .",
    "when the synergic instinct is considered , the individual s reaction to the partner s appeal can be enhanced by love .",
    "for example , mothers often have a biased view of the beauty of their children .",
    "the synergic instinct @xcite is described by    @xmath30    where the synergic function @xmath24 is an increasing and bounded function for @xmath31 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1.eps](c ) .",
    "now , we can take the essential step for describing our love dynamical model .",
    "how does an individual know the partner s romantic feeling ?",
    "in a real situation , the romantic interaction is mediated by communication , e.g. , a talk , a phone call , an email , a letter , etc .",
    "that is , time is required for the romantic feelings of someone to transfer to the other .",
    "in addition , ackerman et al . very recently showed that an individual could delay one s confessing love to adjust potential costs and benefits @xcite .",
    "therefore , the oblivion , the return , and the instinct in the model of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) do not proceed _ simultaneously _ , and the delay time @xmath32 must be added to the return function . as a result",
    ", the love dynamical model can be described by ddes as follows :    @xmath33    for the purpose of simplification , we consider the same delay time @xmath32 for both individuals .",
    "it seems appropriate to comment on the recent work of liao and ran @xcite .",
    "they introduced the time delay on return functions and observed the occurrence of a hopf bifurcation . using the same notation as ref .",
    "@xcite , their model is represented by    @xmath34    it contains the same basic processes of love dynamics : oblivion , return , and instinct .",
    "however , their return function @xmath35 could not fully consider the linear , the secure , and the non - secure return functions .",
    "also , they did not deal with the synergic instinct . as a result",
    ", they could not clarify in which type of return functions the hopf bifurcation can arise .    in their model , the condition for a hopf bifurcation results in    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is a fixed point of the model in eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 - 1 ] ) .",
    "they also showed a numerical example of a hopf bifurcation in which @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "note that @xmath42 is an increasing and bounded function , so individuals 1 and 2 exhibit a secure @xmath43 and an _ anti - secure _ return @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "but an _ anti - secure _ individual seems unusual .",
    "therefore , we will fully investigate the effect of time delay on the love dynamical models suggested by rinaldi , gragnani , and feichtinger @xcite .",
    "in the following section , we will explicitly show that , in both cases of synergic and non - synergic couples , if at least one individual exhibits a non - secure return , then the time delay on the return function can cause a hopf bifurcation .",
    "first , let us consider a couple composed of non - synergic individuals . we follow the same steps in refs .",
