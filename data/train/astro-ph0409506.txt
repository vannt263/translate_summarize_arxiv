    "present understanding of extrasolar planets resembles that of solar system planets when galileo first used the telescope for astronomy in 1610 .",
    "he discovered that the planets of our solar system variously display disks , phases , moons , and ring systems @xcite . though the planets he was studying had been known for thousands of years , before galileo s telescopic observations scientists knew only the character of their motions and lacked a method for learning more .",
    "now that the orbital parameters for 120 planets orbiting other stars are available , we are looking for the breakthrough techniques that will lead us to the next level of understanding for these new extrasolar planets , just as galileo s telescope did 400 years ago for the planets known in ancient times .",
    "we think that the most promising technique for characterizing extrasolar giant planets in the near future is precision photometry .",
    "photometric monitoring of stars has resolved one transiting planet detected by radial velocity methods , hd209458b @xcite , and three more detected by ground - based transit surveys : ogle - tr-56b @xcite , ogle - tr-113b @xcite , and ogle - tr-132b @xcite .",
    "fitting the transit lightcurve of hd209458b allowed @xcite to measure the size of the planet s disk , which determined hd209458b to be a gas giant like jupiter .",
    "further observations of the wavelength dependance of hd209458b s transit lightcurve revealed the presence of upper atmospheric sodium @xcite and an extensive hydrogen envelope @xcite .",
    "extrasolar planets in orbits not in the plane of the sky ( _ i.e. _ , not face - on ) should show phases . though searches to date have not detected the photometric signature expected for the phases of orbiting extrasolar planets , these studies were able to place constraints on the reflective properties of close - in giant planets @xcite .    showed that large moons around transiting extrasolar planets should reveal themselves both by additional stellar dimming while they transit and by their effect on the transit timing of their parent planets . using transit photometry from the _ hubble space telescope _ , @xcite employed this technique to search for moons orbiting hd209458b , but found no evidence for any , consistent with theory for the orbital evolution of such moons @xcite .    the purpose of the present work is to predict what observational photometric transit signatures a ringed planet might make and to point out the possible scientific value of a survey for such signatures .",
    "it is not intended to be a final or comprehensive theory for the study of extrasolar rings in transit .",
    "it is intended to serve as a guide for observers , so that they might have insight into what the unusual deviations in their transit lightcurve residuals might be .    in this paper , we first investigate the possible science that could be done from a transit photometric ring survey .",
    "next we study the practicality of detecting systems of rings around extrasolar giant planets using transit photometry by looking into the effects of extinction and diffraction .",
    "lastly , we simulate a transit of saturn as a well - known example .",
    "ring systems orbit each of the giant planets in our solar system .",
    "the rings are made up of individual particles orbiting prograde in their host planet s equatorial plane .",
    "however , each system of rings is unique , differing in character , radial and azimuthal extent , optical depth , composition , albedo , and particle size .",
    "see table [ table : ring.info ] for a brief summary of what is known about the rings of our solar system .    among solar system planets , by virtue of its rings large effective cross - sectional area ( which we define to be the product of the rings actual cross - sectional area and one minus their transmittance ) saturn by far has the greatest capability to block starlight during a transit .",
    "thus for the remainder of this paper we will concentrate on ring systems with similar radial extent and optical depth , which we refer to as saturn - like ring systems .",
    "the ring systems of uranus , neptune , and jupiter would reamin undetectable with current or predicted future photometric capabilities , and thus our analysis is only applicable to the aforementioned large , saturn - like ring systems .    l|cccc",
    "saturn & 0.01 - 10 m & water ice & young ? & unknown + uranus & not yet measured & uncertain & unknown & unknown + neptune & not yet measured & uncertain & unknown & unknown + jupiter & mostly & silicate & continuously & hypervelocity impacts + & @xmath1 & dust & replenished & into adjacent moonlets +      a survey of ring systems orbiting extrasolar giant planets can potentially address the two big picture questions about ring systems : ( 1 ) how do rings form ? and",
    "( 2 ) how long do rings last ?",
    "if saturn s ring system formed recently and ring systems decay quickly , then extrasolar ring systems as spectacular as saturn s should be rare . if ring systems around extrasolar giant planets are shown to be common , then ring systems are either long - lived , easily and frequently formed , or both .",
    "the typical lifetime of ring systems can be tested directly based on the distribution of ring systems detected around stars of differing ages .",
    "if ring systems survive for many billions of years , then the frequency of ring systems as a function of stellar age should be either flat ( if rings are primordial ) or increasing ( if they are formed by later disruptive events ) . if rings are less prevalent around planets orbiting older stars , then typical ring lifetimes can be constrained by the observations .    uncertainties in stellar age measurements are notoriously large , though , and those uncertainties will propogate into any subsequent estimate of ring formation times and lifetimes using our method .",
    "it seems reasonable that 10 - 20 ringed planets would be necessary to attempt this type of analysis  a number possibly in excess of the number of ringed planets _ kepler _",
    "alone will discover , depending on what fraction of planets have saturn - like ring systems . on the other hand",
    ", kepler might discover that a large fraction of very young ( < 1 gyr ) planets have ring systems , thus improving the statistics and revealing a primordially created population of rings . at present",
    "we lack the basic understanding that would be required to create a model to predict the statistics for ring distribution as a function of stellar age .",
    "photometry during stellar occultations revealed the uranian and neptunian ring systems ; photometry of extrasolar giant planet transits can be used to search those planets for rings .",
    "note , though , that an extrasolar ring census could also be done using photometry of reflected light from directly detected planets @xcite or by microlensing @xcite .    planets with small semimajor axes are most likely to transit . however , ring systems around the closest - in planets ( semimajor axis less than @xmath2 au ) are expected to decay over timescales that are short compared with the age of the solar system , due to such effects as poynting - robertson drag and viscous drag from the planet s exosphere @xcite . although the currently ongoing transit searches are aimed at finding only these short - period planets @xcite , the _ kepler _ ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) space mission will monitor a single region of the sky for up to 4 years and be capable of detecting transiting planets with any period .",
    "planets with periods greater than the length of a photometric survey can not have their periods determined , and thus can not be followed up on . as we show in this paper , though , the _ kepler _ mission should attain sufficient temporal resolution and photometric precision to detect saturn - like ring systems without additional observations .",
    "the number of transiting planets at 10 au that we expect to be detected is low . using the approximate detection probability @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 as the stellar radius and @xmath5 the planet s semimajor axis ) for planets with periods ( @xmath6 ) longer than the observation time ( @xmath7 ) , if every star had a saturn then _ kepler",
    "_ would find @xmath8 among the 100,000 stars it will monitor . if all saturn - like ring systems are made of water ice , then only transiting planets at large semimajor axes could posess rings and therefore the statistics for a ring survey of extrasolar giant planets are not good .",
    "however , every large ring system need not necessarily be made of water ice .",
    "although the composition and temperature of saturn s rings may yet prove necessary for their formation and continued existence , we can not at present rule out silicate rings inward of the ice line , metallic rings around close - in planets , or rings made of lower temperature ices at larger planetary semimajor axes .",
    "_ kepler _ will find and search 50 hd28185b - type giant planets at 1au , if every star has one .",
    "the presence or absence of these unfamiliar ring systems will help constrain the processes involved in the formation and evolution of ring systems as a whole .",
    "rings affect a planet s transit lightcurve in two ways : extinction and scattering .",
    "multiple scattering is negligible in most cases .",
    "extinction occurs as a result of the interception of incoming starlight by ring particles that either absorb , reflect , or diffract the light , removing it from the beam .",
    "the amount of light transmitted through any given portion of the ring is equal to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the normal optical depth and @xmath11 is equal to the sine of the apparent tilt of the rings ( zero being edge - on ) .",
    "the factor @xmath11 compensates for the increased extinction at low tilt angles .",
    "no presently existing or near - future technology can resolve other main - sequence stars , much less a planet in transit across a star s disk .",
    "instead , we calculate the total stellar brightness that would be observed during the transit , and determine whether the structure of dimming expected for transiting planets with rings could be differentiated from the structure expected for planets without rings .    to determine the amount of expected dimming",
    ", we compare the integrated stellar surface brightness to the flux intercepted by a planet and its potential ring system . the stellar surface brightness @xmath12 as a function of projected distance from the star s center , @xmath13 ,",
    "is expressed in terms of @xmath14 as in @xcite , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are coefficients that parameterize limb darkening : @xmath17 the constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 define the character of the limb darkening , with @xmath15 measuring the overall magnitude and @xmath16 the second order shape .",
    "this nontraditional limb darkening parameterization allows meaningful representation of stellar limb darkening from a single parameter , @xmath15 , instead of two or more ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ; our @xmath15 corresponds to their @xmath18 ) and is therefore more appropriate for use in fitting transit lightcurves .",
    "we calculate the total stellar flux ( @xmath19 ) by integrating @xmath20 across the disk of the star over the projected distance from the star s center , @xmath13 : @xmath21 the distance from the star to the observer , @xmath22 , drops out in equation [ eq : integralalgorithm ] and so is not calculated explicitly .    to determine the fraction of starlight blocked by the planet or intercepted by ring material , we integrate over both @xmath13 and the apparent position angle @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fraction of light transmitted at the corresponding @xmath13 , @xmath23 location . the relative flux detected by an observer at time",
    "@xmath26 is then @xmath27 this algorithm is similar to the one that we used in @xcite , but with an explicit azimuthal integral to incorporate ring effects .",
    "as we demonstrated in @xcite , the difference between the transit lightcurve of a given planet and the lightcurve of _ that same planet _ with an additional feature ( such as rings or oblateness ) is not an appropriate measure of the detectability of the feature .",
    "because the parameters of the transit such as the planet radius ( @xmath28 ) , stellar radius ( @xmath4 ) , impact parameter ( @xmath29 ) , and stellar limb darkening ( @xmath15 ) are initially unknown and must be determined using a fitting process , the presence of the ring manifests itself as an astrophysical source of systematic error in the measurement of these quantities .",
    "these errors act to simulate the transit of the ringed planet , and thus diminish the ring detectability .",
    "we then define the detectability of a ring around a transiting planet to be equal to the difference between the ringed planet s transit lightcurve and the lightcurve of the planet - only model that best fits the ringed planet s lightcurve .",
    "figures [ figure : ring.symm.detectability ] and [ figure : ring.asymm.detectability ] show the expected detectability ( in extinction only ) of a planetary ring . in these figures , we simulated transits of a spherical @xmath30 planet with a @xmath31 ring in its equatorial plane extending from @xmath32 to @xmath33 in order to show the character that the detectability of rings might have .",
    "we address more realistic ring systems in section [ section : application ] .",
    "although the particular lightcurves shown are for a planet with a semimajor axis of 1.0 au , _ the detectability for planets at other distances from their stars is the same _ , differing only in the timescale .",
    "thus , the results in this section apply equally well for transiting planets that orbit their stars at @xmath34 and for close - in planets . for a @xmath35 star , to obtain the detectability curve of a planet with semimajor axis @xmath5 multiply the values on the time axis by a factor of @xmath36 .",
    "transits of planets with differing radii and ring structures will differ quantitatively from those plotted in figures [ figure : ring.symm.detectability ] and [ figure : ring.asymm.detectability ] .    for each case , the extinction of starlight through the rings leads to a deeper transit , and therefore a transit lightcurve s best - fit ringless model planet is larger than the real planet .",
    "if an observer were to use the transit depth to estimate the planet s parameters , he or she would overestimate the planet s radius .",
    "this could account for the anomalously high radius of hd209458b ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we find this explanation unlikely : rings around hd209458b would be subject to strong orbital perturbations due to their proximity to the star @xcite , and any ring system would be in the planet s equatorial plane and therefore be seen edge - on during transit if , as expected , the planet is in tidal equilibrium .",
    "we introduce an angle @xmath37 , which we call the axis angle , to represent the azimuthal angle around the orbit normal corresponding to the direction that the planet s rotational angular momentum vector points ( see figure [ figure : schematic ] ) .",
    "we measure @xmath37 from the direction that the planet is travelling in at mid - transit and positive is defined to be toward the star .",
    "the axis angle thus corresponds to the planet s season at midtransit , with @xmath38 being the northern fall equinox , @xmath39 being the northern summer solstice , @xmath40 being the northern spring equinox , and @xmath41 being the northern winter solstice .",
    "we assume the rings to be two dimensional , which is quite a good approximation for the rings of saturn , uranus , and neptune : uranus rings , for instance , are only @xmath42 thick @xcite .",
    "hence , the rings we model do not at all contribute to the lightcurve if they are edge - on during transit , and thus the detectability for planets with obliquity ( @xmath43 ) near @xmath44 or with axis angle ( @xmath37 ) near 0 or @xmath45 is negligible .",
    "also , due to the geometry of the problem , transits for a given axis angle and its opposite are identical .",
    "hence , the transits of planets at solstice , such as those in figure [ figure : ring.symm.detectability ] , could have either @xmath39 or @xmath46 .    in the symmetric case ( @xmath39 ; figure [ figure : ring.symm.detectability ] ) , for low impact parameter transits ( @xmath47 , upper subgraph ) the lightcurve of the ringed planet starts earlier than that of that transit s best - fit spherical planet as the rings encounter the stellar limb first , leading to an initial downturn in the detectability curve .",
    "that curve turns around when the best - fit naked planet hits and the ring s inner gap encounter the stellar limb at nearly the same time causing a sharp change in derivative , whereby the best - fit lightcurve starts to overtake the ringed planet in total light blocked . as a large fraction of ringed planet itself starts to occult the star , the two hypothetical transits become equal about midway through their ingresses .",
    "this trend continues past the midpoint until the inner gap once again causes the simulated ringed planet transit to brighten relative to its best - fit model , and by the end of ingress the edge of the ring encounters the limb of the star at second contact .",
    "the bottom of the transit is nearly flat , as both the planets block the same fraction of starlight .",
    "this process repeats itself in reverse upon egress .",
    "all things being equal , a non - ringed planet would have a much shorter ingress and shallower transit depth than its ringed twin .",
    "but all things are not equal .",
    "what happens instead is that the best - fit naked spherical planet model mimics the simulated ringed planet s lightcurve by lengthening the model fit s ingress and increasing the model s transit depth .",
    "the resulting fits have a higher impact parameter ( @xmath48 ) and greater stellar radius ( @xmath4 ) , which both act to increase the time that the model planet takes to cross the star s limb . at the same time , the model planet s radius ( @xmath28 ) is higher than that of the actual planet to account for the greater effective cross - sectional area that the rings provide the ringed planet . the stellar limb darkening coefficient ( @xmath15 )",
    "differs only slightly in this case to compensate for the different transit impact parameters , and its inability to completely do so results in the downward bow of the detectability curve through the transit bottom .",
    "at this low impact parameter , the most important distinction between the ringed planet transit and its best - fit model is the ringed planet s longer ingress , or earlier first contact and later second contact . because a planet s rings extend equally far from the planet s center regardless of obliquity , low obliquity rings ( @xmath49 ) are as detectable as high obliquity rings ( @xmath50 ) , but remain distinctive by their smaller central clearing . though the ingress only lasts about 45 minutes for a planet with hd209458b s semimajor axis , a planet at 1 au would have a more leisurely ( and more easily sampled ) 3.75 hour ingress .",
    "the signature of a symmetric ringed planet is similar to , but distinct from , the detectability signature of a highly oblate planet @xcite .",
    "the signature for a symmetric ringed planet returns to zero three times during ingress , while the oblate planet detectability signature returns to zero just twice .",
    "the difference between the two is caused by the interior clear area between the planet at the inner edge of the ring .",
    "a planet with rings that extend all the way down to the top of the atmosphere would be very difficult to distinguish from a very highly oblate planet by observational means .    at moderate impact parameters ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath51 ; figure [ figure : ring.symm.detectability ] , middle subgraph ) , expected ring detectabilities are similar in character and magnitude to those at low impact parameter , but last longer due to longer ingress and egress times .",
    "however , symmetric , low obliquity ringed planets no longer have such extended ingress times relative to a ringless planet , and thus have significantly lower detectabilities than they do at lower impact parameters .    high impact parameter symmetric transits of ringed planets ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath52 ; figure [ figure : ring.symm.detectability ] , bottom subgraph ) deviate from the patterns described above",
    ". planets with high obliquity have their ring systems extend beyond the star s edge throughout the transit , and thus become grazing .",
    "lower obliquity planets transiting at high impact parameter have their first contact start no earlier than that of a ringless planet , and thus their detectabilities are less than expected noise levels .",
    "when a ringed planet is not tilted directly toward or away from the observer , the lightcurve that results when the planet transits its star is asymmetric .",
    "the asymmetry is greatest for planets in mid - season , those with @xmath53 where @xmath54 is any integer , and the predicted detectability of rings around these planets is displayed in figure [ figure : ring.asymm.detectability ] .",
    "differences from the symmetric case come about due both to differing lengths of ingress and egress times and to a different part of the planet - ring system making first contact with the stellar limb .",
    "these effects are most important when the planet s projected equatorial plane ( _ i.e. _ the line containing the planet center and the apparent furthermost edges of the rings ) is parallel to the stellar limb during ingress of egress .    at low impact parameter ( @xmath47 ; figure [ figure : ring.asymm.detectability ] ,",
    "top subgraph ) , the planet s direction of motion is nearly perpendicular to the stellar limb , and thus the differences between the symmetric and asymmetric lightcurves are small , changing primarily the intensity of the positive and negative deviations but not their character . small to moderate planetary obliquities ( @xmath55 ) therefore have transit lightcurves that strongly resemble the lightcurves from the symmetric case .",
    "the least detectable configuration at low impact parameter in the mid - season case is for planets with obliquity @xmath56 .",
    "these uranus - like objects have symmetric transit lightcurves for all impact parameters , and low detectabilities at @xmath47 because the stellar limb is covered by the rings at the same time the rings parent planet is covering the limb ( a situation that the best - fit nonringed planet simulates well ) .",
    "differences between the time required for ingress relative to the time for egress dominate the lightcurves for planets transiting near the critical impact parameter ( @xmath51 ; figure [ figure : ring.asymm.detectability ] , middle subgraph ) .",
    "the most detectable cases are those where the projected equatorial plane is parallel to the limb : the @xmath57 and @xmath58 cases in figure [ figure : ring.asymm.detectability ] . for these ringed planets ,",
    "first contact occurs after , and second contact occurs before , the contacts for their best - fit ringless counterparts in the case where the apparent planet motion is left to right ( see diagram at upper left of subfigures of figure [ figure : ring.asymm.detectability ] . upon egress from transit , the rings encounter the stellar limb before the best - fit spherical planet , and hang on to the limb after the best - fit ringless planet ends its transit . these differences in limb - crossing time result in a large initially positive detectability ( ringed minus best - fit nonringed ) as the best - fit planet starts its transit before the ringed planet , a transition to negative values while both are near second contact , and then a return to near - zero detectability for the transit bottom when both objects are entirely in transit .",
    "on egress , the resulting detectability is again initially positive as the ringed planet lightcurve brightens when the rings exit transit before the limb of the best - fit planet , and again becomes negative when the best - fit planet exits transit before the lingering final edge of the rings of the ringed planet .",
    "this character of transit lightcurve is appropriate for planets with @xmath59 . for planets with @xmath60",
    "the sequence would be time - reversed . for low",
    "obliquity ringed planets transiting at @xmath51 , the asymmetric component of the transit lightcurve is overshadowed by the symmetric component , and thus in character resembles a cross between the two . at maximum obliquity ( @xmath56 ) , the detectability curve is symmetric but moderately large , with maxima resembling the @xmath38 case in magnitude .",
    "the detectabilities of asymmetric ringed planets when transiting at high impact parameters ( @xmath52 ; figure [ figure : ring.asymm.detectability ] , bottom subgraph ) are similar to those for @xmath51 , except that the transit lightcurve sequences are truncated due to the grazing nature of this particular transit . because there is no second or third contact",
    ", there is no transit bottom and the detectabilities never return to near zero as they do in the non - grazing cases .",
    "the discovery mission _ kepler _ , with typical photometric precision @xmath61 and 15 minute sampling @xcite should be most sensitive to planets with large ring systems and with periods longer than @xmath62 , irrespective of scattering ( see section [ section : diffraction ] ) .",
    "higher cadence measurements with similar precision , as acquired by _",
    "hst _ @xcite and as may be possible in the near future from the ground @xcite , would be capable of detecting rings around closer - in planets , if such rings exist ( see section [ section : motivation ] ) .",
    "calculation of scattering from a transiting extrasolar ring system resembles the calculation of scattering from a ring in the solar system as it occults a star . in both problems",
    ", starlight passes through a thin slab of ring particles and is altered on its way to the observer , who measures the star s brightness .",
    "however , while for solar system applications the distance between observer and ring is small and the observer - star and ring - star distances are both large , in the transit case the distance between the ring and the star is small and the observer - star and observer - ring distances are large .",
    "@xcite analyzed photometry from saturn s occultation of the star 28sgr in 1989 , and we base our theoretical models on theirs , with appropriate modifications for the altered circumstances between occultations and transits",
    ".    particles between @xmath63 and @xmath64 in size contribute most of the opacity in the rings around saturn , uranus , and neptune @xcite .",
    "particles like these , much larger than the wavelength of light passing through them , scatter light in the forward direction when incident light diffracts around individual particles .",
    "the relative scattered flux as a function of the scattering angle , the phase function @xmath65 , is ( assuming spherical particles ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the particle radius , @xmath68 is the wavelength of light , and the function @xmath69 represents the first bessel function .",
    "equation [ eq : phasefunc ] integrates to @xmath70 over the forward @xmath71 steradians in order to conserve flux , but is only accurate when @xmath72 .",
    "the shape of this function resembles that of a stellar diffraction point spread function from a telescope . in effect",
    ", it represents the collective poisson s spots of the ring particles viewed from , say , 50 parsecs away .",
    "the total flux diffracted by the ring particles is equal to the flux that they intercept .",
    "this can be inferred from babinet s principle : the diffraction of a beam caused by a particular screen containing both transparent and opaque areas appears the same as the diffraction of the screen s inverse , which has the opaque and transparent areas switched .",
    "hence the flux of light diffracted by a ring filled with particles of radius @xmath67 is the same as the flux of diffracted light coming from a black sheet peppered with holes of radius @xmath67 , which is equal to the light transmitted thorugh the holes in the sheet .",
    "thus on top of absorption , diffraction provides an additional , equal source of opacity for photons travelling straight through the ring .",
    "this effect can be confusing @xcite , so we follow @xcite in explicitly representing the optical depth resulting from geometrically intercepted , absorbed light as @xmath73 and the total optical depth , including scattering effects , as @xmath74 .",
    "the actual effective geometrical cross - sectional area of the ring particles varies with optical depth due to shadowing effects .",
    "we express the total scattered flux that emerges from a point on the ring integrated over all angles ( @xmath75 ) as a function of the flux incident on that point ( @xmath76 ) @xcite : @xmath77 @xmath75 peaks at @xmath78 with a value @xmath79 .",
    "the variable @xmath11 is equal to the sine of the apparent tilt of the rings ( zero being edge - on ) , and compensates for the correspondingly higher optical depths for low tilt . the flux exitting the ring in the direction of the observer ( designated @xmath80 ) at a specific angle ( @xmath23 ) when diffracted from _ a point source star _ ,",

    "however , for transits the planet is in close enough proximity to the star that the star must be treated as an extended source .",
    "hence , the scattered flux from a point on the ring is not simply the product of the incident flux on the ring and the phase function , as in the solar system case , because @xmath23 is not constant",
    ". instead we integrate over the stellar disk to derive the total scattered flux at earth from across the extended star , @xmath83 .",
    "we first calculate the illumination provided for each parcel of the star onto the ring . to determine this incident flux",
    ", we treat the star as a limb - darkened lambertian disk .",
    "the flux incident on a point in the rings from a region of that disk depends on the emergent stellar flux from the region as a function of the projected distance from the star s center , @xmath84 ( which we get from equation [ eq : limbdarkening ] ) ; the area of the region , @xmath85 ; and the distance between the region and the ring portion in question , which we approximate to always be @xmath5 , the planet s semimajor axis : @xmath86    one of the two @xmath87 terms derives from our assumption that the star is a flat disk , and the other comes from the need to measure the incoming flux in a plane perpendicular to the observer s line of sight . though the second @xmath87 is real , the first term is an artifact of our model , and as such is probably not representative of an actual planet around a spherical star .",

    "the total flux emergent from the ring , scattered from the extended star in the direction of the observer ( @xmath88 ) , comes from integrating the star s flux over each infinitessimal area of the star @xmath89 , times the phase function for the particular angle @xmath23 between that area , the scatterer , and the observer : @xmath90 due to circular symmetry around the center point of the limb darkened star , the _ total _ integrated incident flux is only a function of the projected distance of the ring from the star s center , @xmath91 , and not of the azimuthal location of the rings around the star , @xmath37 . when incorporating scattered light into the calculation of transit lightcurves , we integrate equation [ eq : starfluxintegral ] numerically using an adaptive stepsize runge - kutta algorithm from @xcite .",

    "these very large particles diffract the light only from the point directly behind them on the star toward the observer , and therefore in the large particle limit the maximum diffracted flux per unit area at a given point is equal to the flux emitted by the star at the point behind the ring ( times the optical depth factor ) . hence to the rightward edge of figure [",
    "figure : partsizescattering ] the scattered fluxes approach the flux levels at the equivalent point on the stellar disk . in figure",
    "[ figure : rpositionscattering ] , the flux scattered by a sufficiently large particle would trace the limb darkening of the star for @xmath95 and be zero for all values larger than @xmath96 , similar to the curve of the 1 mm particles plotted .    for a transiting ring made up of large particles , diffraction does not affect the shape of the lightcurve .",
    "however because light diffracted out of the incident beam is redirected to the observer , diffraction would act to partially fill in the lightcurve during the transit , reducing the total transit depth ( figure [ figure : scatter.lightcurve ] ) .",
    "the reduced depth gives the impression that the rings are dispersing less flux than they really are .",
    "thus , if the ring particles are large , the _ measured _ optical depth of the rings is equal to the geometrical optical depth , @xmath97 , because the light diffracted out of the beam is entirely replaced ( the same as if there were no diffraction at all ) .    for small particles ( smaller than @xmath98 for the 1 au case )",
    ", incoming light is diffracted nearly isotropically . in this limit",
    "only a small fraction of the incident flux is diffracted in any one direction , and the received scattered flux is constant over the planet s orbit ( except , of course , during the secondary eclipse ) .",
    "the diffracting behavior of such particles is represented by the leftmost edge of figure [ figure : partsizescattering ] and resembles the behavior of the @xmath99 particle in figure [ figure : rpositionscattering ] .    since for a ring made up of small particles the diffracted flux reaching",
    "the observer is unvarying , the shape of the planet s transit lightcurve is the same as it would be in the absence of scattering ( figure [ figure : scatter.lightcurve ] ) . for this case",
    "the best - fit measurement of the ring s optical depth would represent the total optical depth , @xmath100 : a negligible fraction of the diffracted light reenters the beam .",
    "note that the large particle and small particle cases can not be distinguished based on their transit lightcurves alone .",
    "if a ring were detected in transit , but no distinctive signature of scattering was found ( like are described below ) , it would be impossible to determine whether the ring s component particles were large or small .",
    "likewise the proper interpretation of the measured optical depth would also be degenerate .    for ring particles that lie in between these extremes of size",
    ", scattering affects the lightcurve and can be used to infer the size of the component particles that make up the ring . in this moderate regime ,",
    "the light diffracted toward the observer from a parcel of ring particles comes from a circularly symmetric region behind the parcel that grows in size as the particles diameters shrink .",
    "this footprint , shown in figure [ figure : scatterimage ] , represents a weighted map of where photons scattered toward the observer come from .",
    "most of the light comes from the area within the first fringe .",
    "the effect of scattering on a transit lightcurve is maximized for ring particles near the size that has its first diffrataction fringe a projected distance @xmath4 from the particles .",
    "this critical particle size is large enough to allow the footprint to scatter a lot of light toward the observer while the ring is in front of the star s disk , but small enough to scatter significant light toward the observer while the planet is off the limb of the star as well .",
    "we set @xmath23 to the first zero of the the phase function , @xmath65 ( equation [ eq : phasefunc ] ) , and solved to obtain the critical particle size , @xmath101 , which we define to be the ring particle radius near which diffraction s effect on the lightcurve is maximized , using the small angle approximation : @xmath102    transit lightcurves for ringed planets change significantly as @xmath67 varies within an order of magnitude of @xmath101 .",
    "however for particle diameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 , transit lightcurves are indistinguishable from those for @xmath105 and for @xmath106 respectively .",
    "thus large particles are those with @xmath107 , and small particles are those with @xmath108 .",
    "parcels of ring containing particles with diameters within a factor of @xmath109 of @xmath101 scatter light to the observer both before and after they encounter the stellar limb , as viewed from earth .",
    "this leads to an increased photometric flux measured just before first contact , and just after fourth contact during a transit event .",
    "the lightcurve signature ( see figure [ figure : scatter.lightcurve ] , inset ) of this ramp is diagnostic of diffractive scattering .",
    "moreover , the characterisic size of the extrasolar planet ring particles can be determined from the shape and magnitude of the pre- and post - transit scattering signature .",
    "only if the ring particle diameters are within a factor of 10 of @xmath101 can anything at all be discerned about the particle sizes  otherwise , lightcurve models using very large particles and those using very small particles will fit equally well .",
    "similar lightcurve ramps to the ones shown in figure [ figure : scatter.lightcurve ] can result from refraction through the outer layers of the atmosphere of a transiting extrasolar giant planet .",
    "@xcite showed that refractive scattering will likely become important only for planets with semimajor axes of tens of au or greater .",
    "in particular , our calculations ( using the codes developed for @xcite ) show that the refraction ramp for a typical transiting egp at 14 au would be 100 times smaller than the ring diffraction ramps in figure [ figure : scatter.lightcurve ] .",
    "therefore , a detected lightcurve ramp for a transiting ringed planet can reasonably be ascribed to diffraction from ring particles .",
    "near @xmath101 , rings diffractive scattering affects the planet s transit lightcurve in between first and fourth contacts as well .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure : scatter.lightcurve ] , the depth of the transit bottom decreases as ring particle size increases because inside the transit larger particles scatter light incident upon the ring into the direction of the observer more efficiently than small particles do .",
    "if @xmath110 , more of the diffraction footprint will overlap with the star near mid - transit than at the beginning and end of transit . in this case ,",
    "more diffracted light is detected at midtransit , and the transit lightcurve bottom is flattened . fitting the simulated lightcurves plotted in figure [ figure : scatter.lightcurve ] with spherical planets , we calculate that the flattening is of order @xmath111 for a standard ring .",
    "though the lightcurve deviations described in this section are illustrative of those we would expect to see owing to diffraction through planetary rings , they are not a perfect calculation of what diffraction through a real ring system will look like .",
    "an actual ring system is likely to have complexity in its radial structure that we have not simulated here .",
    "also , real ring particles will have a nonuniform distribution of sizes , similar to the particles that make up saturn s rings @xcite .",
    "we are able to say , however , that difraction around appropriately sized ring particles can lead to a ramp in the transit lightcurve of a ringed extrasolar planet , that this ramp can be detectable , and that such a ramp is greatly in excess of the expected magnitude for similar ramps resulting from planetary atmospheric effects .",
    "saturn s ring system is distinctly more complex than the @xmath78 , @xmath112 standard ring that we have used up to this point . in particular",
    ", @xcite showed that the intricate radial optical depth structure of saturn s rings significantly alters the directly - detected orbital lightcurve relative to the lightcurve for radially uniform rings .    to test whether the detectability of complex ring systems differs substantially from that of our simple standard ring",
    ", we used a radial optical depth profile of saturn s rings obtained during the 28 sgr occultation in 1989 @xcite binned down into 39 subrings .",
    "we set the rings particle diameter to 1 cm , a typical value from @xcite .",
    "we then simulated transits of saturn at impact parameter 0.2 , calculated a best - fit spherical planet transit to match , and subtracted the two to represent saturn s detectability .    the detectability of the rings around saturn , as shown in figure [ figure : saturn.detectability ] , is a bit less than the standard ring because the total area covered is smaller .",
    "however , the character of the ring signal is the same as that of the standard ring .",
    "extrasolar astronomers , viewing a transit of saturn with a photometric precision of @xmath113 from 28 sgr , would detect saturn s rings as long as the axis angle @xmath37 was nt such that they were viewed edge - on .    at 10 au from the sun , @xmath101 for saturn",
    "is 0.66 mm ( from equation [ eq : acritical ] ) .",
    "therefore , as calculated saturn s particle size falls in the large regime and we would predict no scattering effects to be discernable .",
    "figure [ figure : saturn.detectability ] does not show any significant pre- or post - transit scattered light , in agreement with our analysis . without a positive identification of scattering",
    ", the astronomers from 28 sgr would not know whether the ring particles were large or small , and therefore would not know whether their measured ring optical depth corresponded to the geometric optical depth ( @xmath73 ) or the total optical depth ( @xmath10  see section [ section : results ] ) .",
    "the primary effect rings have on a planet s transit lightcurve is to increase the transit depth . without knowledge of the rings existence , the best - fit unadorned spherical model planet will have an anomalously large radius and transit closer to @xmath51 than the actual ringed planet .    the detection of large , saturn - like ring systems requires photometric precision of a few @xmath114 , achievable with space based photometers and potentially from future ground - based platforms .",
    "the transit signature of rings is concentrated at ingress and egress , and therefore ring detection requires high time - resolution photometry .",
    "diffraction around individual ring particles manifests as forward scattering that can be detected from transit lightcurves as excess flux just before and just after a ringed planet s transit .",
    "the shape and magnitude of the scattering signal can be used to discern the ring particles modal diameter .      in the near - future",
    ", the experiments described in this paper can be tested on close - in transiting planets found from the ground , using follow - up transit photometry from space .",
    "later , the nasa discovery mission _ kepler _ will be capable of both detecting planets with larger semimajor axes , and surveying these new worlds for rings .",
    "together , these observations hold the promise to establish a rough outline of the distribution of large saturn - like ring systems within the next decade .",
    "the authors wish to thank : robert h. brown and william b. hubbard for excellent advising ; renu malhotra , gwen bart , and wayne barnes for manuscript suggestions ; and peter lanagan for allowing the generous use of his u of a press library ."
