    "the size density adheres to standard scaling , in contrast with some aggregation processes in which scaling is violated ( see e.g. @xcite . )    in general , introduction of choice changes the shape of the cluster - size distribution . when the merger maximizes the size of the final aggregate , the small - size tail of the distribution",

    "surprisingly , the large - size tail of the distribution is also enhanced .",
    "the opposite effect emerges when the merging clusters minimize the aggregate size .",

    "we found a number of interesting features for aggregation with choice . in the asymmetric version with maximal choice",
    ", the scaling function does not capture the entire size density .",
    "in particular , when @xmath163 clusters are involved in the aggregation process , there are @xmath163 distinct scaling laws that characterize the density of monomers , dimers , up to @xmath163-mers .",
    "the population of these small clusters is anomalously large compared with that of typical clusters . in the asymmetric version with minimal choice , the large-@xmath81 tail is super - exponential @xmath238 $ ] , and it is governed by a nontrivial exponent @xmath153 .",
    "this exponent is selected from a spectrum of possible values according to a principle that is reminiscent of velocity selection in nonlinear traveling waves .",
    "one model with symmetric choice which would be interesting to explore is the following : pick up randomly three clusters and merge two of them , e.g. the smallest or the largest .",
    "we analyzed our models only in the mean - field case , and another extension is to aggregation in finite spatial dimensions .",
    "for instance , clusters may occupy a single lattice site , and hop to adjacent sites with the same mass - independent rate , and when three clusters occupy the same site , two of them , say the smallest , merge .",
    "the third ( largest ) cluster thus plays a role of a catalyst .",
