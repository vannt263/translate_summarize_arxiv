    "it is a well known fact that the nonrelativistic nucleon - nucleus optical potential is nonlocal and energy dependent feschbach_ann , feschbach_book .",
    "nevertheless , a common approach to studying the elastic @xmath0 scattering is the use of phenomenological local optical models , and a variation of the model parameters with the incident projectile energy can be taken as a sign of the presence of nonlocal effects in the scattering process @xcite .",
    "for example , a recent work presented local and global optical potentials for neutron and proton elastic scattering from nuclei that fall in the mass range @xmath1 @xcite , while nucleon incident energies ranged from 1 kev to 200 mev .",
    "the authors obtained excellent elastic angular distribution fits using local optical potentials each consisting of 20 fit parameters , however , the strength of the central real part showed the largest variation with incident energy .",
    "another measure of nonlocality is given by the size of the perey damping factor , as will be discussed in the present study for the case of the presence of a gradient term in the optical potential .",
    "such a gradient term , also denoted as velocity dependent term , is usually absent in conventional optical model potentials , but has been introduced in a previous study @xcite , and will be the object of further analysis in the present investigation .",
    "the nonrelativistic optical potential contains several sources of nonlocalities .",
    "one such nonlocality is due to the pauli exclusion principle and can be taken into account by antisymmeterizing the wave function as in the hartree - fock theory @xcite .",
    "further , in the hartree - fock equation , the nonlocality due to exchange effects can be expressed in terms of a spatially variable mass @xcite .",
    "more recently , the importance of accounting for the pauli principle at incident energies greater than 25 mev has been established @xcite . at low energies",
    "the importance of the pauli exclusion principle has been investigated in collective - model coupled - channel calculations @xcite .",
    "a second source of nonlocality is due to the coupling of the inelastic excitations to the nuclear ground state during the scattering process @xcite , that gives rise to a nonlocal dynamic polarization potential in the elastic channel .",
    "since this nonlocality is difficult to take into account rigorously , it is usually accounted for by numerically coupling a few important inelastic channels to the elastic channel @xcite .",
    "however , when the energy of the incident nucleon is low enough , the scattering process is strongly affected by the individual discrete states of the target nucleus . a recent study that employed the multichannel algebraic scattering theory ( mcas ) to explore the dynamic polarization potential fraser , canton for low incident energies also showed that the resulting optical potential was strongly nonlocal and energy dependent .",
    "recently , we introduced a novel gradient term in the schrdinger equation describing the @xmath0 elastic scattering process .",
    "we interpreted this term as a change in mass of the incident nucleon when moving inside the nuclear matter of the target nucleus @xcite .",
    "the mass change could be a consequence of the nucleon - nucleon interaction being affected by the presence of surrounding nucleons , like a surface tension which is present only at the surface of the target nucleus .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that our model , in ref .",
    "@xcite , resulted in excellent fits to the @xmath2 elastic scattering data when the coefficient of the derivative term was assumed to be proportional to the gradient of the nuclear density , which is most important at the nuclear surface .",
    "furthermore , our model reproduced well the large angle scattering minima that are usually associated with nonlocalities @xcite .",
    "however , it is still not yet clear whether the gradient term also simulates other sources of nonlocal effects in the phenomenological optical model like , for examples , the pauli exclusion principle and coupling of the elastic channel to the inelastic ones .",
    "we formulated the mass dependence by introducing a kisslinger type potential into the conventional optical model @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by writing the schrdinger operator as @xmath3    where the resulting potential @xmath4 is velocity - dependent and has the form : @xmath5 .",
    "\\label{vdp}\\end{aligned}\\]]the velocity - dependent potential @xmath6 plays the role of a nonlocal potential @xmath7 .",
    "in fact there is an equivalence between a velocity - dependent ( or momentum - dependent ) potential and a nonlocal potential @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this can be seen by interpreting the gradient term that acts on the wave function as the first term of a taylor series that displaces the wave function from point @xmath8 to a different location .",
    "furthermore , the spatially variable effective mass @xmath9 is assumed to have the @xmath10where @xmath11 is an isotropic function of the radial variable @xmath12 that expresses the change of the projectile s mass with distance @xmath12 from the center of the target nucleus @xcite .",
    "the notion of an effective mass has also been introduced in relation to relativistic optical models that give rise to significantly reduced effective masses serot . for example , the relativistic effects on the nucleon mean free path in the intermediate energy range were investigated in ref .",
    "in addition , the idea of an effective mass was considered for the specification of a microscopic optical model potential ref .",
    "@xcite . at this point",
    "we stress that the gradient term in our model is different from the darwin term present in the nonrelativistic equivalent of the dirac - based relativistic formulation @xcite because , firstly , our effective mass is real while the darwin term is complex . secondly , in the nonrelativistic equivalent of the dirac formulation , the darwin term",
    "is closely coupled to the spin orbit potential while our gradient term is independent of the spin orbit term @xcite .",
    "furthermore , unlike the case for the relativistic models mentioned above , our gradient term is expressed as an effective mass that has a radial dependence , rather than in terms of an additional scalar potential that is added to the mass .",
    "finally , the effective mass formulation has also been introduced in the field of condensed matter physics calculations @xcite .",
    "other phenomenological forms of nonlocalities have also been considered such as a parity - dependent term in the optical potential @xcite for low energy scattering of protons from @xmath13 .",
    "this parity dependence was later justified tentatively in terms of the feshbach channel coupling effect @xcite . a presently much used nonlocality , first introduced by frahn and lemmer @xcite and further developed by perey and buck in the 1960ies , is given in the form of an integral kernel @xmath14 that acts on the wave function .",
    "perey and buck also obtained a local equivalent potential in the corresponding schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "a non local potential @xmath15 acts on the nonlocal wave function @xmath16 in the form @xmath17 while a local potential @xmath18 acts as a factor @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a local wave function .",
    "like the local wave function , @xmath16 is a function of one radial coordinate only . in the nuclear interior ,",
    "a local potential leads to local wave functions which are different from the corresponding nonlocal ones obtained using a nonlocal potential , even though both forms may lead to the same asymptotic phase shift .",
    "this is known as the perey effect austern , and may be expressed quantitatively as @xmath21where @xmath20 and @xmath22 are the local and nonlocal wave functions respectively , while the perey damping factor is defined as @xmath23 @xcite . in the nuclear interior , an attractive nonlocal potential results in a reduction in the nonlocal wave function ( @xmath24 ) , while for a repulsive potential the situation is reversed leading to an enhancement of @xmath22 , that is , @xmath25 . as discussed by austern @xcite , nonlocality arises when one singles out from the overall wave function that part which describes the motion in the elastic channel . outside the nucleus",
    "@xmath22 is the full physical wave function of the system .",
    "however , inside the nucleus part of the wave function of the system is hidden in the invisible ( inelastic ) channels , which results in a suppression of the nonlocal elastic wave function compared to the local one .",
    "conversely , for a repulsive nonlocal potential , the particles of the target nucleus are driven away from the incident particle .",
    "however , conservation of the flux demands that the incident particle carries more flux in order to compensate for the part of the channel space which has been suppressed austern . a more recent work employed nonlocal potentials in three - body direct nuclear reaction calculations and an important nonlocality effect in transfer reactions was reported @xcite .    in this work",
    "our aim is to show that the presence of a velocity - dependent part in the conventional , phenomenological optical potential simulates a source of nonlocality .",
    "this is achieved by showing that , in the interior of the nucleus , the nonlocal wave functions are different from the corresponding local ones obtained in the absence of a gradient term ( @xmath26 ) in accordance with the perey effect",
    ". we shall also demonstrate that this effect is angular momentum dependent .",
    "in ref .",
    "@xcite , we considered a novel velocity - dependent optical potential of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ vdp ] ) based on the change of mass of the incident nucleon , and obtained excellent fits for the elastic @xmath27 angular distribution data in the low energy range of @xmath28 mev .",
    "most notably the model reproduced well the prominent large - angle , backscattering minima which depend sensitively on the incident energy , and which are a sign of the presence of nonlocalities rawitscher - l-69,clark .",
    "the local potential consisted of central and spin orbit potentials and was taken to have the form : @xmath29where @xmath30 stands for @xmath31 and so on for the rest of the terms .",
    "in addition , the function @xmath32 has the following woods - saxon form : @xmath33},\\]]with @xmath34 being the mass number of the target nucleus . in order to reduce the number of fit parameters ( 12 ) we used the same set of parameters for the real and imaginary parts of the spin - orbit term . in what follows the nonlocal wave function",
    "@xmath22 is the solution of the schrdinger equation corresponding to the velocity - dependent potential @xmath35 given in eq .",
    "( [ vdp ] ) .",
    "the potential parameters are adjusted to obtain a best fit to the experimental @xmath2 elastic scattering angular distribution .",
    "the local wave function @xmath20 , however , is the solution of the schrdinger equation corresponding to the equivalent local potential @xmath18 whose parameters are adjusted to ( i ) fit experimental data and ( ii ) produce the same phase shift values as those obtained using the nonlocal potential @xmath35 . in the local equivalent potential case , the effect of nonlocalities in the scattering process are manifested as a variation of the potential parameters with energy .",
    "this procedure is not unique , but is guided by the conventionally used method to fit angular distributions .",
    "the local wave function obtained in this way is not equal to the trivially equivalent local wave function , which is obtained by starting the fit in the presence of a velocity dependent term , and then mathematically transforming the @xmath36 away by a renormalization of the wave function @xmath37 ericson .    in sec .",
    "[ rd ] , we demonstrate that the nonlocal wave function @xmath38 is indeed different form the local wave function @xmath39 in the nuclear interior , which supports our hypothesis that the gradient term introduced into the conventional phenomenological optical potential simulates a source of nonlocality . in addition , we find that the enhancement or suppression of the nonlocal wave function relative to the local one to be angular momentum dependent .",
    "this is in line with earlier works that modeled the @xmath0 elastic scattering by introducing a parity - dependent term @xmath40 into the optical potential @xcite .",
