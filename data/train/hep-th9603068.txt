    "there have been many recent investigations into the formation of disoriented chiral condensates ( dccs ) following a relativistic heavy - ion collision@xcite .",
    "the original motivation for studying this problem was the centauro events@xcite , rare cosmic ray events in which a deficit of neutral pions was observed@xcite . in a recent work @xcite , the time evolution of the hadronic plasma produced in such a collision was studied by using the @xmath0 linear sigma model in a longitudinal expansion . the large-@xmath1 expansion was used to incorporate non - equilibrium and quantum effects into the problem . after performing numerical simulations to solve the time - dependent equations of motion ,",
    "instabilities were found to exist for only a short time , and thus no significant amount of pion domains would be formed . in this work",
    ", we study the same problem using a spherical expansion , since at late times the expansion becomes spherical .",
    "this situation produces the most rapid cooling of the system .",
    "we would like to see if the formation of instabilities in this geometry is more pronounced than in a longitudinal expansion .",
    "there are two questions which should be examined .",
    "first , we want to know which types of initial conditions lead to the formation of instabilities in the system ; and second , if instabilities do form , we want to find out if the size of the unstable region is large enough to see significant domain growth . to answer the first question , we examine the proper - time evolution of the system , starting a short time after the phase transition , where the linear sigma model is appropriate .",
    "we look for the effective mass of the pion to go negative during the time evolution .",
    "this signifies the onset of growth in long - wavelength modes , which is believed to lead to the formation of dccs .",
    "when we have a case where instabilities form , we then compute the momentum distribution of outgoing pions , and compare to a hydrodynamical model calculation , assuming local thermal equilibrium .",
    "we find a noticeable enhancement of low momentum modes as compared to the hydrodynamical model .",
    "this provides an experimental signature which can be measured .",
    "the implication is that the system is evolving out of thermal equilibrium , which is a necessary condition to have significant growth of low momentum modes .",
    "we prepare the initial state of the system in local thermal equilibrium , and study the evolution using scale invariant kinematics ( @xmath3 ) to model the cooling of the plasma .",
    "scale invariant kinematics are appropriate for a high energy spherical expansion starting from a point source @xcite , and imply that mean - field expectation values only depend on the proper time @xmath4 .",
    "we incorporate non - equilibrium and quantum effects through the use of the large-@xmath1 expansion .",

    "we fixed the value of @xmath21 at the initial time as the solution of the gap equation in the initial thermal state .",
    "we also required that the initial expectation values of the @xmath12 and @xmath153 fields satisfy @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the equilibrium value of @xmath10 at the initial temperature @xmath156 .",

    "this can be compared with the longitudinal expansion @xcite , where the regime of instability was much smaller , @xmath166 .",
    "this is because the spherical expansion leads to a much larger negative gradient for @xmath21 than the longitudinal case .",
    "figures [ fig : chi ] and [ fig : sigpi ] show the results of the numerical simulation for the proper time evolution of the system .",
    "we display the auxiliary field @xmath21 in units of @xmath167 , the classical fields @xmath20 in units of fm@xmath159 , and the proper time in units of fm . at proper times greater than @xmath169",

    "the size of the unstable region ( @xmath172 ) is at most 2 - 3 fm .",
    "thus we find that the spherical expansion does not produce larger domains than the longitudinal case .",
    "we also see that when we start the initial expectation value of @xmath20 in the @xmath173 direction that the system becomes slightly more unstable .",
    "we notice that if the derivative of the field is positive or zero that this is insufficient to generate instabilities .    in fig .",

    "figures [ fig : ns1 ] and [ fig : ns0 ] show the number density calculated from ( [ nstau ] ) , for several different proper times .",
    "figure [ fig : ns1 ] is a case where instabilities have arisen in the system , and there is a large amount of particle production during the time that @xmath21 has gone negative .",
    "figure [ fig : ns0 ] is a case with no instabilities , and there is very little particle production as a function of proper time .",

    "we compare these distributions to a hydrodynamical model calculation [ see ( [ eq : c - f3 ] ) ] , where we have assumed that when the system reaches the `` out '' regime , the final distribution is a combination of a thermal distribution in the comoving frame at @xmath177 boosted to the center of mass frame using the boost variable @xmath178 ( see @xcite ) . for comparison purposes , we have renormalized the thermal distributions to give the same center of mass energy ( @xmath179 gev ) as the corresponding non - thermal distributions .",
    "we see that as a result of the non - equilibrium evolution , there is an enhancement at low momentum independent of whether or not there are instabilities ; however , the effect of instabilities is to greatly magnify this low momentum enhancement .",
    "in this paper we have performed numerical simulations to examine the chiral phase transition during a uniform spherical expansion of the hadronic plasma .",
    "we used the linear @xmath12 model to leading order in a large-@xmath1 expansion and studied a wide range of initial conditions starting above the critical temperature for the phase transition .",
    "we found initial conditions which drove the system to instabilities that lead to the formation of disoriented chiral condensates . due to the necessity of a rather large renormalized coupling constant , the formation of instabilities lasted only a short time because of the large exponentially growing quantum corrections in ( [ eq : chiu ] ) , and no significant amount of domain formation was observed .",
    "however , we find that the phase space number density for our non - equilibrium evolution is significantly different from one which would result from an evolution in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the experimental signature for domain formation is an increase in the pion particle production rate at low momentum .",
    "our calculations were done in a mean - field approximation , where all the mode coupling is due to the presence of this mean field . in next order in large-@xmath1 , scattering in the background mean field occurs , and the possibility for re - equilibrization exists .",
    "these effects will be incorporated in a future calculation . in comparison to particle production during a longitudinal expansion , we find that in a spherical expansion the system reaches the `` out '' regime much faster and more particles get produced . however the size of the unstable region , which is related to the size of the domain of dccs , is not enhanced .",

    "<S> we also show that an experimental signature of domain growth is an increase in the low momentum spectrum of outgoing pions when compared to an expansion in thermal equilibrium . in comparison to particle production during a longitudinal expansion , we find that in a spherical expansion the system reaches the `` out '' regime much faster and more particles get produced . however the size of the unstable region , which is related to the domain size of dccs , is not enhanced . </S>"
