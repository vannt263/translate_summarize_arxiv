    "the calculation of hadron masses in lattice gauge theory has a long history . over the years",
    "there has been a steady improvement in computing power and methods allowing simulations on larger volumes and smaller quark masses with higher statistics . however , the progress to smaller lattice spacing @xmath3 has been slower because of the high computer cost which increases by at least a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "since it is so expensive to reduce cut - off effects by reducing @xmath3 , we should consider reducing them by improving the action .",
    "a systematic improvement program reducing the cut - off errors order by order in @xmath3 has been proposed by symanzik  @xcite and developed for on - shell quantities in ref .  .",
    "the standard gluonic action has discretization errors of @xmath5 , but those for wilson fermions are of @xmath0 . therefore it is the fermionic action which is most in need of improvement .",
    "sheikholeslami and wohlert   proposed the action ( we assume @xmath6 throughout the paper ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the original wilson action and @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) the sum extends over the four plaquettes in the @xmath10-plane which have @xmath11 as one corner , and the plaquette operators @xmath12 are the products of the four link matrices comprising the plaquettes taken in a clockwise sense .",
    "if @xmath13 is appropriately chosen , this action removes all @xmath0 errors from on - shell quantities such as the hadron masses .",
    "a non - perturbative evaluation of this function leads to  @xcite @xmath14 when we talk about improved fermions in the following , we always understand that @xmath13 has been chosen according to eq .",
    "( [ nonpert ] ) .    in this paper we shall present results for the light hadron mass spectrum , the light and strange quark masses and the light meson decay constants using the improved action .",
    "the calculation is done for two values of the coupling , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which allows us to test for scaling .",
    "the mass calculations extend our earlier work  @xcite where we have examined the @xmath13 dependence at @xmath1 . to exhibit the effect of improvement",
    ", we have also done calculations with wilson fermions on the same lattices .",
    "most of our wilson data come from our structure function calculations  @xcite , and we combine this with masses from the literature at other @xmath15 values to see the dependence on @xmath3 clearly .    from the meson correlation functions we also extract meson decay constants and quark masses . however , simply improving the action is not sufficient to remove all @xmath0 errors from these quantities",
    ". here we also have to improve the operators which is done by adding higher dimensional terms with the same quantum numbers in an appropriate fashion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we briefly describe our numerical method .",
    "the hadron masses are given in sec .",
    "3 , concentrating in particular on the extrapolation to the chiral limit and the scaling behavior of improved and wilson action results . in sec .",
    "4 we compute the light and strange quark masses using two different methods , from the axial vector current ward identity and from the lattice bare quark masses .",
    "the meson decay constants are discussed in sec .",
    "5 . finally , in sec .",
    "6 we give our conclusions .",
    "our calculations have mainly been done at @xmath1 and @xmath2 on @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 lattices .",
    "we use quadrics ( formerly called _ ape _ ) parallel computers . for the improved case the parameter @xmath13",
    "is given from eq .",
    "( [ nonpert ] ) as @xmath19 at @xmath1 and @xmath20 at @xmath21 .",
    "the simulations are done for at least five different @xmath22 values in each case .",
    "this helps with the extrapolation to the chiral limit .",
    "for the gauge field update we use a combination of 16 overrelaxation sweeps followed by a three - hit metropolis update .",
    "this procedure is repeated 50 times to generate a new configuration .",
    "the improvement term in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) appears in the site - diagonal part of the action . the major overhead in our case is multiplication by this term during inversion of the fermion mass matrix .",
    "in our basis of hermitean gamma matrices we can rewrite this term as  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 are @xmath26 matrices ( two - spinors with color ) , so that instead of a @xmath27 multiplication we have two @xmath26 multiplications and two inexpensive coordinate transformations .",
    "this reduces the overhead for the improvement in the inverter from 45% to 30% . also , the inverse of the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ matr ] ) is required on half the lattice due to the even - odd preconditioning .",
    "we now have to invert two @xmath26 instead of a @xmath27 matrix .",
    "however , this is only required once for each propagator inversion .    for the matrix inversion we mainly used the minimal residue algorithm , except for the lightest quark mass on the larger lattices where we used the bicgstab algorithm  @xcite .",
    "as convergence criterion we chose @xmath28 for the residue , which is the best that can be achieved for our single precision machine .    for the mass calculations we used jacobi smearing for source and sink . for a detailed description of our application of this procedure see ref .",
    "we have two parameters we can use to set the size of our source , the number of smearing steps , @xmath29 , and the smearing hopping parameter , @xmath30 .",
    "we chose @xmath31 for @xmath1 and @xmath32 for @xmath21 and @xmath33 at both @xmath15 values .",
    "this gives roughly the same r.m.s .",
    "radius in physical units in both cases , namely @xmath34 . to define the matrix elements for the decay constants and quark masses , we have also computed correlation functions with smeared source and local sink .",
    "this does not require any additional matrix inversions .",
    "at @xmath1 and @xmath35 we had generated @xmath36 configurations for our structure function project on which we have computed the hadron masses .",
    "to these we added @xmath37 new configurations on which we computed the meson decay constants and the chiral ward identity .",
    "for @xmath19 we have analyzed @xmath38 configurations .",
    "for the heavier quark masses , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , respectively , the number of configurations was @xmath43 . on the @xmath44 lattice",
    "we have generated @xmath45 and @xmath43 configurations at @xmath35 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "at @xmath21 we only ran on @xmath44 lattices .",
    "here we have analyzed @xmath45 configurations for @xmath35 and @xmath47 configurations for @xmath20 .",
    "we employed both relativistic and non - relativistic wave functions  @xcite , except for the high statistics runs where we only looked at the non - relativistic wave function in order to save computer time .",
    "besides our calculations at @xmath1 and @xmath2 we also made exploratory studies at @xmath48 to see what effect varying @xmath13 has on coarser lattices .",
    "if one decreases @xmath15 , increases @xmath13 or increases @xmath22 , one starts to get problems with exceptional configurations .",
    "this showed up in non - convergence of our fermion matrix inversions .",
    "it was , however , only a real problem at @xmath48 , @xmath49 and  @xcite @xmath1 , @xmath50 .",
    "we consider hadrons where all the quarks have degenerate masses .",
    "we looked at @xmath51 , @xmath52 , nucleon ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 masses , and we have used this nomenclature for all quark masses , not just in the chiral limit .    in our mass calculations we have made single exponential fits to meson and baryon correlators over appropriate fit ranges .",
    "the errors are determined using the bootstrap method with 50 data samples .",
    "we present our hadron mass results in tables [ tm57 ] , [ tm60 ] and [ tm62 ] .",
    "table  [ tm60 ] updates the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the meson masses we found very little difference between using relativistic and non - relativistic wave functions , and we settled for relativistic wave functions ( except for the high statistics runs ) .",
    "for the nucleon we have chosen non - relativistic wave functions  @xcite which performed slightly better because the effective mass plateaus extended to larger times . at @xmath1 we repeated the lightest quark mass on @xmath16 on the @xmath17 lattice , for both improved and wilson fermions .",
    "the values agree within less than 3% .",
    "this indicates that all our results on the @xmath16 lattice do not suffer from significant finite size effects .      to obtain the critical value of @xmath22 , @xmath57 , and the hadron masses in the chiral limit",
    ", we extrapolate our data to zero @xmath51 mass .",
    "we first tried @xmath58 using this relation gives a rather poor fit of the data , and we saw that there was a slight curvature in a plot of @xmath59 against @xmath60 .",
    "quenched chiral perturbation theory predicts  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is small and positive .",
    "we made fits using this formula but found that @xmath62 was always negative .",
    "as in our previous work  @xcite we conclude that our @xmath22 values are too far from @xmath57 for the formula to be applicable .",

    "( note that the two formulae differ only by terms of @xmath79 ) . to decide which fit formula is best and to do a reliable extrapolation to the chiral limit , it is important to have many @xmath22 values . for the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 masses",
