    "more generally , we show that the cloaking efficiency ( the ratio of total cross section to geometric cross section ) must worsen proportional to the diameter when averaged over any finite bandwidth for cloaking of isolated objects in air ( or any medium of negligible loss and dispersion ) . unlike our previous proof that sensitivity to imperfections worsens with diameter at individual frequencies  @xcite , the result in this paper holds even for perfect fabrication and for materials with negligible absorption over the desired bandwidth .",
    "our proof involves some unusual mathematical techniques .",
    "first , we equate the frequency - averaged problem to a single scattering problem at a complex frequency with the help of a version of the optical theorem .",
    "second , we map the complex - frequency problem to an equivalent real - frequency problem with transformed materials .",
    "we can then use the fact that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath2 for any physical causal material at @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite to analyze an `` effective '' absorption loss in a manner similar to our previous work  @xcite . finally , in sec .",

    "the idea of transformation - based invisibility cloaks was proposed in 2006 @xcite , a fascinating idea that was followed by many theoretical works  @xcite and several experimental demonstrations of cloaking of isolated objects at one frequency  @xcite . however , as pointed out by pendry using a speed - of - light argument  @xcite and by miller with a more formal approach  @xcite , _ perfect _ cloaking of an isolated object in vacuum over a non - zero bandwidth is impossible due to causality .",
    "this severe limitation helped inspire the idea of ground - plane cloaking @xcite and its experimental demonstrations  @xcite , which circumvents such causality limitations ( although it is still subject to other practical scaling difficulties  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the pendry and miller proofs say little about imperfect cloaking ( a nonzero but small scattering cross - section ) . by continuity ,",
    "if near - perfect cloaking is attained at a single frequency , `` good '' cloaking ( total cross - section bounded by some given fraction of the geometric cross - section ) must persist over some finite bandwidth .",
    "we show that causality imposes an even stronger constraint than forbidding perfect cloaking over a finite bandwidth : for a bandwidth - limited cloak , we show that causality constraints imply that the bandwidth of good cloaking scales inversely with the object diameter .",

    "@xcite we showed that the cloaking problem at one frequency becomes increasingly difficult as the size of the object being cloaked increases .",
    "in particular , we proved that the imperfections due to absorption losses and random fabrication disorder must decrease asymptotically with the object diameter in order to maintain `` good '' cloaking performance : for the total ( scattering + absorption ) cross - section to be less than a given fraction @xmath14 of a geometric cross section @xmath15 . to prove these results , we assumed bounds on the attainable refractive index contrast in the cloak , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , which we showed to be equivalent to bounds on the singular values of @xmath13 . using these bounds , we were then able to bound the field amplitudes in the cloak in terms of the field amplitudes in the virtual space ( which are a constant for incident planewaves ) ; such bounds , in turn , impose bounds on the allowed absorption losses and random disorder . in particular , we showed in the case of absorption losses that @xmath18 scales proportionally to @xmath19 , a measure of the inverse diameter .",
    "we now wish to analyze the effect of other imperfections , especially inevitable material dispersion , on the cloaking performance , even in the idealized case of perfect fabrication and negligible absorption .",

    "consider any finite - volume scatterer ( in a linear time - invariant system ) , described by some change @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the permittivity and the permeability compared to the ambient medium .",
    "let the incident field ( in the absence of the scatterer ) be described by a six - component vector field @xmath41 . in the presence of the scatterer ,",
    "this is modified to a new total field @xmath42 , the sum of the incident and scattered fields .",
    "the charge perturbations in the scatterer are described by bound electric and magnetic polarization currents @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , which can be combined into a six - component current field @xmath45 .",
    "abstractly , we can write @xmath46 for some linear operator @xmath47 relating the incident fields to the induced currents , and causality ( currents come after fields ) implies that @xmath47 is an analytic function in the upper - half complex-@xmath38 plane  @xcite .",
    "physically , the scattered field is the field produced by these oscillating induced currents @xmath48 in the scatterer , and the interactions of the currents and fields provide a simple way to characterize the absorbed and scattered powers .",
    "the total absorbed power @xmath49 , assuming an ambient medium with negligible dissipation , equals the total time - average ( @xmath50 ) incoming poynting flux : @xmath51 where we have defined the inner product @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , the scattered power is the work done by the currents on the scattered field : @xmath53",
    ". therefore , the total ( @xmath54 ) power is : @xmath55 where we have defined @xmath56 .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath14 as a forward - scattering amplitude when @xmath57 is a planewave is actually irrelevant to our proof , but it follows from the fact that @xmath14 in that case is simply the forward - planewave fourier component of the field @xmath58 corresponding to the currents @xmath48 .",
    "the key question , for our purposes , is to understand what @xmath14 looks like at a complex frequency .",
    "suppose we have homogeneous , lossless ambient medium with an incident planewave @xmath59 propagating in the @xmath60 direction for a constant amplitude @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath62 moving all the @xmath63 dependence to the right - hand side of the inner product . at a complex frequency @xmath64 in the upper - half plane ( @xmath65 ) ,",
    "@xmath66 is analytic by causality , while the planewave terms are analytic everywhere ( and become exponentially decaying or growing waves in space at complex @xmath38 ) .",
    "so , @xmath14 at a complex frequency represents an overlap with an exponentially growing field of the currents produced ( via @xmath47 ) by an exponentially decaying source . in the next section ,",
    "we clarify this picture further by relating the scattering operator @xmath47 at a complex frequency to scattering at a real frequency with complex materials .    in order to perform contour integrations of @xmath67 multiplied by a lorentzian ,",
    "it is not enough for @xmath14 to be analytic , however : it must also be bounded as @xmath68 so that we can close the contour above .",
    "this fact is used extensively in quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , this occurs because the the exponential growth of @xmath69 cancels the exponential decay of @xmath70 .",
    "mathematically , as @xmath68 the @xmath39 and @xmath40 must vanish ( since all susceptibilities vanish in the limit of infinite frequency  @xcite ) , and so @xmath47 simplifies : to lowest order for weak scatterers ( i.e. , in the first born approximation ) , @xmath71 , in which case the exponential factors exactly cancel .",
    "we will use a similar procedure , below , to analyze the effects of small imperfections in the cloak due to material dispersion .      combining the previous two sections",
    ", we can now relate the frequency - averaged scattering cross - section , for an incident planewave ( say in the @xmath63 direction to the solution of a single scattering problem at a single complex frequency : @xmath72 evaluated at @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath74 represents the induced currents @xmath48 , for the materials evaluated at the complex @xmath38 , in response to an exponentially decaying incident planewave ( multiplied by a constant amplitude @xmath61 ) .",
    "the interpretation of this problem is simplified by the fact that a complex frequency is mathematically equivalent to using modified _",
    "materials _ at a real frequency @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , consider maxwell s equations in the frequency domain : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are ( free ) electric and magnetic current densities , respectively . for our complex @xmath38 , the @xmath78 term becomes @xmath79 { \\omega_\\text{op}}{\\mathbf{e}}$ ] , which looks exactly like the term for a real frequency @xmath22 at a modified permittivity @xmath80 @xmath81 similarly for @xmath82 .",
    "thus , operating at a complex frequency is equivalent to _ two _ changes in the materials .",
    "first , the multiplication by @xmath83 corresponds to an effective absorption added throughout all space ( including the ambient medium ) .",
    "second we evaluate @xmath31 and @xmath32 at @xmath84 rather than at the real frequency @xmath22 , which will change their values in the presence of material dispersion .",
    "so far , we have shown that the problem of finding the frequency - averaged scattering cross section is equivalent to solving a certain scattering problem at a single complex frequency , which in turn is equivalent to a scattering problem at a single _ real _ frequency @xmath22 with modified complex materials @xmath80 and @xmath85 . in this section ,",
    "we analyze the consequences of those effective material modifications , divided into two separate material changes as discussed above , for cloaking performance .",
    "the first change in the materials is the multiplication of @xmath31 and @xmath32 by @xmath86 . but this change does not hurt the cloaking performance because it is done uniformly _ everywhere _ in space .",
    "more explicitly , if @xmath87 is a valid transformation - based cloak , so is @xmath88 , except that this is now a transformation - based cloak for a lossy ambient medium @xmath89 , and similarly for @xmath90 .",
    "therefore this change in the materials leaves the scattering cross - section invariant .",
    "the second change in the materials is that we need to evaluate @xmath31 and @xmath32 at the complex frequency @xmath84 instead of @xmath22 , and here the presence of material dispersion ( unavoidable for any material other than vacuum ) acts to spoil the cloak . in particular , as reviewed in the appendix , causality and other fundamental principles imply that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both strictly _ positive _ at @xmath91 for @xmath92  @xcite , corresponding to an unavoidable additional absorption in the complex - frequency scattering problem .",
    "unlike the artificial absorption in the previous section , this is an absorption _ defect _ introduced only in the cloak : @xmath31 ( both @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) differs from the cloaking transformation of the ambient medium by @xmath95 \\left(1 + i\\frac{\\delta\\omega}{{\\omega_\\text{op}}}\\right),\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath32 .",
    "the key assumptions here are that the ambient medium has no dispersion over the given bandwidth , so that the ideal cloaking transformation at the complex @xmath38 is given by the second term in @xmath39 , and that the ambient medium is lossless , so that @xmath96 is real and @xmath97 .",
    "more generally , it is sufficient for the dispersion and loss of the ambient medium to be small enough , compared to the dispersion of the cloak materials , such that @xmath98 is @xmath99",
    ".    we can analyze the consequences of this effective absorption imperfection similarly to our previous work  @xcite it is convenient to first transform the imperfections to virtual space ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cloak - iso ] ) where the scattering problem is easier , because in the absence of @xmath39 and @xmath40 we have a planewave in a homogeneous medium .",
    "in particular , given an upper bound @xmath30 on the index contrast as discussed above , one obtains @xmath100 in virtual space , and similarly for @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "furthermore we are only interested in the regime in which we have a good cloak  once the imperfections become so large as to make the cloak useless , all of the scaling relations break down and the problem is no longer interesting .",
    "this is the regime in which @xmath39 and @xmath40 are small , and therefore virtual space at complex @xmath38 is equivalent to a homogeneous medium with small imperfections and perturbative methods are applicable .",
    "in particular , the lowest - order scattering current ( in virtual space ) is simply @xmath101 , and similarly for @xmath102 . in the notation of sec .",
    "[ sec : optical ] , @xmath103 . substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ transformed - scat ] ) , we find that the exponential factors @xmath104 exponential factors exactly cancel , leaving : @xmath105 .\\ ] ]    this has two main consequences .",
    "first , @xmath106 for @xmath92 since @xmath98 and @xmath107 are strictly positive as noted above : even if the cloak is a perfect cloak at @xmath22 , it is imperfect when averaged over any non - zero bandwidth .",
    "this is , therefore , an alternative proof of the results of pendry  @xcite and miller  @xcite that cloaking of isolated objects over a non - zero bandwidth is impossible for physical , causal materials .",
    "second , exactly as we showed for other imperfections in previous work  @xcite , it immediately follows that @xmath36 grows @xmath108 and hence the frequency - averaged cloaking efficiency @xmath109 scales proportionally to a mean diameter @xmath110 .",
    "this is the central result of our proof , but to better understand its consequences we consider some special cases in the next section .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the fractional cross - section @xmath111 , averaged over a bandwidth @xmath21 around @xmath22 , must scale proportional to the diameter @xmath24 , at least as long as @xmath112 ( i.e. until cloaking breaks down completely ) .",
    "there are two possible sources of this linear scaling , depending on whether @xmath36 is limited by the cross - section at @xmath22 ( due to imperfections in the cloak at the design frequency ) or by the bandwidth of a dip in the cross - section around @xmath22 ( due to material dispersion degrading a near - perfect single - frequency cloak ) . in the former case ,",
    "the physical mechanism is simply that the losses due to imperfections at @xmath22 scale with diameter , as we already proved in ref .  .",
    "in the latter case , however , it leads to a new prediction : in a bandwidth - limited cloak , the bandwidth must narrow as the object diameter increases .",
    "in fact , we show in this section that the bandwidth generically narrows inversely with the diameter in this case .",
    "first , let us consider the bandwidth scaling from generic dimensional considerations .",
    "because of material dispersion , one expects good cloaking to only be possible in some limited bandwidth @xmath113 around some design frequency @xmath22 , in which case a small @xmath114 requires @xmath115 . if we taylor - expand @xmath116 in @xmath117 , we would generically expect an expansion of the form : @xmath118\\ ] ] for some coefficient @xmath119 , where @xmath119 is generically @xmath99 if @xmath22 is chosen to be a minimum of @xmath20 .",
    "for sufficiently small bandwidths @xmath120 , this is dominated by the scattering at @xmath22 , which scales linearly with diameter in the presence of imperfections as shown in ref .  .",
    "on the other hand , for a good single - frequency cloak at @xmath22 , there is a regime @xmath121 where the second term dominates , i.e. where material dispersion is the limiting factor .",
    "the @xmath122 term must therefore also scale linearly with the diameter in order for @xmath116 to scale linearly for such @xmath21 , and hence we can conclude that the bandwidth @xmath123 of the cloak generally _ scales inversely with diameter_.    this is best illustrated by a simple example . consider the case where @xmath124 achieves a minimum @xmath125 at @xmath22 with an approximately lorentzian lineshape of width @xmath123 , going to  1 at frequencies far from @xmath22 : @xmath126 the integral of eq .",
    "( [ meanscat ] ) for this @xmath127 can be evaluated analytically to obtain @xmath128.\\ ] ] since this must scale linearly with diameter for any @xmath125 and any @xmath129 , it follows that both @xmath14 and @xmath130 scale linearly with diameter until cloaking breaks down .",
    "to illustrate and validate our predictions of this scaling of cloaking bandwidth , we performed explicit numerical calculations of the scaling for an example bandwidth - limited spherical - cloaking problem ( near - perfect at one frequency , but degraded by causal dispersion at other frequencies ) in vacuum ( with nondimensionalized units @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) .    at an operating frequency @xmath22",
    ", we use an exact `` pendry '' cloak  @xcite : a sphere of radius @xmath133 is surrounded by a cloak of radius @xmath134 that is linearly mapped to an empty sphere ( @xmath135 ) , resulting in materials : @xmath136 @xmath137 we fixed @xmath138 , so that the cloaking material parameters are the same for all @xmath133 , merely rescaled in space as the object becomes larger or smaller .    by construction",
    ", at @xmath22 we have a _ perfect _ cloak , and the only limiting factor is the bandwidth : we use idealized lossless materials but with causal dispersion relations that satisfy the kramers  kronig constraints .",
    "in particular , we use a combination of two limiting cases : a plasma model ( a limit of a drude model as losses go to zero ) and a limit of lossless lorentzian resonance ( corresponding to a polarization field described by a lossless harmonic oscillator ) at a frequency @xmath139 . combined with the prescribed pendry values at @xmath22 from above , this results in dispersion relations : @xmath140\\frac{{\\omega_\\text{op}}^2}{\\omega^2 } , \\ ] ] @xmath141 the lorentzian resonance frequency @xmath139 can be chosen arbitrarily ; we used @xmath142 .",
    "this geometry was then simulated using a spectral ( spherical - harmonic expansion ) scattering - matrix method as described in ref .  .",
    "the continuously varying anisotropic material parameters are approximated by a large number of piecewise - homogeneous isotropic layers  @xcite .",
    "the total scattering cross - section was computed over a range of frequencies for @xmath143 ( where @xmath144 ) , and is plotted in fig .",

    "[ fig : cs - w ] are converged with resolution ( the number of spherical layers ) to within a few percent accuracy . at @xmath22 ,",

    "as predicted , the cloaking bandwidth decreases linearly with the object radius , for three object radii relative to @xmath147 . ]",
    "as expected , the material dispersion prevents this from being a good cloak except at frequencies in a narrow bandwidth around @xmath22 , and this bandwidth becomes narrower as the diameter increases .",
    "quantitatively , if we look at the bandwidth at a fixed @xmath145 of about 1/4 its maximum , we find that the bandwidths for @xmath148 and @xmath149 are @xmath150 and @xmath151 times the bandwidth for @xmath152 , respectively , almost exactly the predicted linear scaling .",
    "[ far from @xmath22 , one expects @xmath20 to approach twice the total geometric cross section , in the limit of a large scatterer , because in this limit all of the incident light is scattered .",
    "the factor of two comes from the definition of scattering cross section  @xcite , in which the scattered power appears twice : once as the scattered waves propagating in other directions , and once as the `` shadow '' canceling the forward - propagating wave . here",

    "@xmath156 in this work , we extended on our previous paper  @xcite to study the bandwidth limitation of isolated - object cloaking which is a key limiting factor for this type of cloaking  @xcite .",
    "although it was known that perfect cloaking was impossible over a nonzero bandwidth , this result did not seem to exclude the possibility of imperfect cloaking over a finite bandwidth . indeed , imperfect finite - bandwidth cloaking is possible , but we have now shown that it is subject to a severe practical constraint : the bandwidth inevitably narrows proportional to the object diameter , given fixed materials .",
    "although we can not infer any hard upper bounds on the size or bandwidth of such cloaking without further information about the attainable materials , this result indicates a fundamental challenge in scaling up small experimental demonstrations to larger cloaks .",
    "the use of gain has been proposed to compensate for loss problems in cloaking  @xcite .",
    "although gain is necessarily nonlinear and can be detected by a sufficiently strong incident field , in the idealization of linear gain then many of the techniques in this paper are complicated by the fact that a linear - gain resonance ( the complex - conjugate of an absorption resonance ) would be non - analytic ( and have negative imaginary parts ) in the upper - half complex - frequency plane .",
    "( the average @xmath20 must also be replace by the average @xmath157 or similar , since gain can produce a @xmath158 .",
    ") however , the bandwidth limitations described in this paper arise even for idealized materials with negligible dissipation loss , due to dispersion in the real part of the @xmath159 and @xmath32 alone , in which case even idealized linear gain is inapplicable .",
    "( furthermore , as pointed out in our previous work  @xcite , gain compensation of absorption must become increasingly perfect as the object diameter increases , nor does it compensate for scattering from fabrication disorder . )",
    "ground - plane cloaking does not suffer from any intrinsic limitation on its bandwidth from causality , nor does our proof apply in that case .",
    "the reason our proof does not apply ( at least , in the present form ) to ground - plane cloaking is the figure of merit is no longer @xmath20 : a ground - plane is actually _ designed _ to reflect waves , albeit to reflect them in a way that mimics the ground plane . on the other hand",
    ", our previous work  @xcite showed that even ground - plane cloaks are increasingly sensitive to imperfections as the size of the object increases .",
    "this suggests that ground - plane cloaks should also be increasingly sensitive to material dispersion , for cloaking over a finite bandwidth , as the object size increases , and a challenge for future work is to quantify ( or disprove ) this relationship .    an alternative direction for cloaking theory ( and experiment )",
    "is to consider relaxations of the cloaking problem that might prove more practical . in particular",
    ", it would be valuable to make precise the intuition that the cloaking problem becomes easier if the incident waves are restricted ( e.g. to plane waves from a certain range of angles ) and/or the observer is limited ( e.g. only scattered waves at certain angles are visible , or only amplitude but not phase can be detected , or sufficiently small time delays are undetectable ) , since this is arguably the situation in most experiments . for example , current `` stealth '' aircraft are designed in the radar regime mainly to reduce back - scattering only  @xcite .",
    "so , it is clear that a sufficiently relaxed cloaking problem is practical even for large objects , and one interesting goal is to find the `` weakest '' relaxation that remains practical at useful scales .    this work was supported in part by the army re- search office through the institute for soldier nanotechnologies ( isn ) under contract w911nf-07-d-0004 , and by the afosr multidisciplinary research program of the university research initiative ( muri ) for complex and robust on - chip nanophotonics , grant no .",

    "<S> we show that cloaking of isolated objects is subject to a diameter  bandwidth product limitation : as the size of the object increases , the bandwidth of good ( small cross - section ) cloaking decreases inversely with the diameter , as a consequence of causality constraints even for perfect fabrication and materials with negligible absorption . </S>",
    "<S> this generalizes a previous result that _ perfect _ cloaking of isolated objects over a nonzero bandwidth violates causality . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate broader causality - based scaling limitations on any bandwidth - averaged cloaking cross - section , using complex analysis and the optical theorem to transform the frequency - averaged problem into a single scattering problem with transformed materials . </S>"
