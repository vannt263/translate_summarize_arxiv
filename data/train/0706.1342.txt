    "the electron dephasing time , @xmath0 , in mesoscopic structures at very low temperatures has recently attracted intense theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite attention .",
    "one of the key issues under exquisite discussion is whether @xmath0 should diverge to an infinite value or  saturate \" to a finite value as @xmath5 k. it is known that even very dilute magnetic scattering , if any exists , could eventually dominate over all other kinds of inelastic electron scattering ( in particular , the nyquist electron - electron scattering @xcite and the electron - phonon scattering @xcite ) and control @xmath0 at sufficiently low temperatures , leading to a seemingly saturated behavior over a certain range of temperature .",
    "the magnetic scattering time , @xmath6 , in clean metals containing dilute magnetic impurities have very recently been extensively checked theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it has been argued if intrinsic electron - electron interactions in the presence of disorder might lead to saturation in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "there are also theories proposing that materials properties associated with specific dynamical structural defects ( often modeled as two - level tunneling systems @xcite ) may cause noticeable dephasing at low temperatures @xcite . in spite of these different opinions",
    ", one consensus has been reached by several groups , saying that the responsible electron dephasing processes in _",
    "highly disordered _ and _ weakly disordered _",
    "metals might be _ dissimilar _ @xcite .",
    "that is , while magnetic scattering is responsible in weakly disordered metals @xcite , a different mechanism may be relevant for the  saturation \" or very weak temperature dependence of @xmath0 found in highly disordered alloys @xcite .",
    "thus , systematic studies of the temperature and disorder behaviors of @xmath0 in highly disordered metals should be of great interest , and would provide valuable information complementary to that learned from weakly disordered metals @xcite .    for the convenience of discussion , those samples recently studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where the values of diffusion constant @xmath3 are comparatively large ( typically , @xmath8 100 @xmath9/s ) , will be referred to as being  weakly disordered , \" while the samples with values of @xmath10 10 @xmath9/s and smaller to be discussed in this work will be referred to as being  highly disordered . \" in the free - electron model , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the fermi velocity ( wave number ) , @xmath14 is the effective electron mass , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the electron elastic mean free time ( path ) , and @xmath17 is the dimensionality of the sample .",
    "that is , in the following discussion we assume @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ( residual ) resistivity .",
    "we shall survey and discuss the low - temperature electron dephasing times in the concentrated gold - palladium ( aupd ) alloys whose resistances , magnetoresistances and @xmath0 have previously been extensively measured by several groups @xcite .",
    "the reasons for our revisiting the temperature and disorder behaviors of @xmath0 of this particular material are discussed below . here",
    "we emphasize that the electron dephasing time @xmath20 or @xmath21 is both a function of temperature and a function of disorder .    1 .   ever since the first works of dolan and osheroff @xcite , and giordano _ et al .",
    "@xcite on the weak - localization and electron - electron interaction effects in 1979 in aupd , this material has been continuously studied by several groups until nowadays .",
    "narrow wires , thin films , and thick films have been fabricated and studied , corresponding to one- ( 1d ) , two- ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems , respectively , with regards to the weak - localization @xcite and electron - electron interaction @xcite effects .",
    "thus far , there already exist in the literature a good amount of data based on this single material .",
    "therefore , a close examination of any possible correlation among those _ independently measured _ dephasing times @xmath0 should be desirable and insightful .",
    "2 .   in the course of the quantum - interference studies , the source materials used by different groups were obtained from different suppliers , and",
    "the molar compositions au@xmath22pd@xmath23 used were different .",
    "in most cases , @xmath24 varied between 40 and 60 and , thus , the samples fell in the concentrated alloy regime .",
    "moreover , different techniques were employed for the fabrication of samples , including the thermal - flash evaporation , electron - beam evaporation , dc sputtering , and rf sputtering deposition methods .",
    "different substrates such as glass , quartz , and sapphire substrates were also adopted in different experiments ; whereas it is known that quartz and sapphire substrates contain far fewer ( magnetic ) impurities than glass substrates do .",
    "+ as a consequence , the levels of magnetic impurities contained in the bulk of the samples , if exist , should be different from sample to sample prepared by different groups .",
    "furthermore , in the case of narrow wires and thin films , the amounts of magnetic scattering due to the surfaces and the interfaces between the sample and the substrate , if exist , should also differ from sample to sample prepared by different groups .",
    "therefore , one should expect _ randomly distributed",
    "_ values of the  saturated \" dephasing time @xmath2 for the various samples , if the measured @xmath2 should originate from the magnetic scattering due to _ unintentional _ magnetic impurity contamination .",
