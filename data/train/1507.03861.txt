    "the characterization of biaxial nematic phases in a number of thermotropic liquid - crystalline systems @xcite stimulated a revival of interest in the investigation of theoretical models to describe biaxial structures @xcite .",
    "about forty years ago , freiser @xcite showed the existence of uniaxial and biaxial nematic phases in a generalization of the mean - field maier ",
    "saupe theory of the nematic transition with the addition of suitably asymmetric degrees of freedom .",
    "a nematic biaxial phase has also been shown to exist in a lattice model with steric interactions between platelets @xcite , and in a number of calculations for model systems with soft and hard - core interactions @xcite .",
    "the early experimental results , however , referred to a lyotropic liquid - crystalline mixture @xcite , which should be better represented by a model of uniaxial nematogenic elements @xcite , and which motivated the use of an elementary version of the maier  saupe theory @xcite to investigate a lattice statistical model for a binary mixture of cylinders and disks .",
    "we now propose an extension of this elementary model , along the lines of freiser s generalization of the maier  saupe theory , in order to analyze the global phase diagram of a mixture of uniaxial and biaxial molecules .    in some analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite calculations ,",
    "it has been pointed out that shape fluctuations play an important role in the stability of the biaxial nematic phases . in spite of the complexity of the liquid - crystalline systems , whose complete description may require the introduction of more realistic , and necessarily involved , theoretical models , we believe that there is still room for the investigation of elementary statistical lattice models , with the addition of some ingredients that may be essential to describe the main features of the thermodynamic behavior . along the lines of freiser s early work ,",
    "we then add extra degrees of freedom , of biaxial nature , to an elementary lattice model , which leads to the definition of a six - state maier ",
    "saupe ( ms6 ) model .",
    "this ms6 model is similar to an earlier proposal by bocarra and collaborators @xcite , and may be regarded as a generalization of a previously used three - state potts model to describe the uniaxial nematic transition @xcite .",
    "shape fluctuations are taken into account by introducing a biaxiality parameter  @xmath2 , and by considering a binary mixture of molecules with @xmath3 ( intrinsically uniaxial molecules ) and @xmath4 ( intrinsically biaxial molecules ) .",
    "this model system is sufficiently simple to be amenable to detailed statistical mechanics calculations for either quenched @xcite or annealed mixtures of molecules .",
    "we then carry out calculations to obtain global phase diagrams , and write an expansion of the free energy to make contact with the standard form of the phenomenological landau ",
    "de gennes theory of phase transitions .",
    "this paper is divided as follows . in section [ sec : ms6 ] , we define the ms6 model for a binary mixture of molecules , and formulate the statistical problem . in section [ sec",
    ": mean - field ] , we analyze the mean - field equations , draw a number of characteristic phase diagrams , and make contact with the landau  de gennes theory .",

    "the standard formulations of the maier  saupe theory of nematic phase transitions @xcite can be described in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a positive parameter , @xmath7 means that the sum is over pairs of molecules at sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the symmetric traceless quadrupole tensor associated with a molecule at site @xmath8 . in general , @xmath11 may be written in terms of the direction cosines or euler angles which connect the laboratory and molecular frames . from the traceless condition",
    ", we write the eigenvalues @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , of the tensor @xmath15 , where @xmath2 is a parameter that gauges the degree of biaxiality .",
    "the problem is considerably simplified if we resort to a discretization of directions , which has been used to describe the isotropic - nematic transition @xcite .",
    "we then assume that the principal molecular axes are restricted to the directions of the cartesian coordinates of the laboratory .",
    "therefore , the quadrupole tensor @xmath16 can assume only six states represented by the matrices @xmath17{ccc}% -1+\\delta & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1-\\delta & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{array } \\right )   , \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{ccc}% -1+\\delta & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & -1-\\delta \\end{array } \\right )   , \\nonumber\\label{seisa}%\\]]@xmath17{ccc}% -1-\\delta & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1+\\delta & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{array } \\right )   , \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{ccc}% -1-\\delta & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & -1+\\delta \\end{array } \\right )   , \\label{seisb}%\\]]@xmath17{ccc}% 2 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1-\\delta & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & -1+\\delta \\end{array } \\right )   , \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{ccc}% 2 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1+\\delta & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & -1-\\delta \\end{array } \\right )   , \\nonumber\\label{seisc}%\\ ] ] which leads to the definition of the six - state maier ",

    "we introduced an elementary six - state maier - saupe ( ms6 ) lattice model , which is obtained by the addition of extra degrees of freedom , of biaxial nature , to an earlier three - state model .",
    "we then described a phase diagram with biaxial as well uniaxial nematic structures and an isotropic phase .",

    "results are obtained in terms of a parameter @xmath2 of shape fluctuations that gauges the degree of biaxiality .",
    "we then used this ms6 model to consider a binary mixture of intrinsically uniaxial ( @xmath3 ) and intrinsically biaxial ( @xmath4 ) molecules , and investigated the effects of shape fluctuations \" on the phase diagrams in terms of temperature and either chemical potential or concentration of biaxial molecules .",
    "taking into account the fluid character of the liquid - crystalline systems , in the present work we restricted the analysis to a thermalized ( annealed ) situation , in which case orientational and shape degrees of freedom reach equilibrium simultaneously .",
    "we obtained a wealth of topologically distinct phase diagrams , with several nematically ordered structures and multicritical points .    in the uniform case , in terms of temperature @xmath0 and the parameter @xmath2",
    ", we regained the first - order transitions between isotropic and uniaxial nematic phases , and the critical lines between the biaxial and uniaxial nematic phases , which meet at a landau multicritical point . for a binary mixture of biaxial and uniaxial molecules ,",
    "we have drawn a number of phase diagrams in terms of temperature versus concentration of biaxial molecules , with fixed values of @xmath2 , which display many distinct features .",
    "depending on parameters , there appear additional multicritical points , such as tricritical and critical end points associated with the biaxial nematic phase .",
    "the landau , tricritical and critical end points may give rise to a higher - order multicritical point . also , depending on the range of values of @xmath2 , there may be a line of landau points meeting a line of triple points at a landau end point .",
    "this intricate behavior of the mixtures of intrinsically uniaxial and biaxial molecules can be understood in terms of crossings of the microscopic energy levels as we change the degree of biaxiality @xmath2 .",
    "the explicit expressions for the free energy were used to obtain the coefficients of an expansion at high temperatures , in the vicinity of the landau multicritical point , and to make contact with the landau - de gennes theory .",
    "we were then able to check our numerical findings against a number of phenomenological calculations of the literature . also , we provided a simple way of obtaining the expansion coefficients in terms of the values of the molecular parameters .",
    "the calculations predict the presence of stable biaxial nematic phase at low temperatures and sufficiently high concentrations of biaxial molecules , which is in agreement with recent calculations of longa and coworkers @xcite for a more elaborate model system of a mixture of biaxial molecules in the annealed situation .",
    "depending on the degree of biaxiality , we predict first - order transitions between biaxial and uniaxial nematic phases , as well as tricritical points , even in the absence of a landau multicritical point . for larger values of the degree of biaxiality ,",
    "the landau point splits into lines of triple points .",
    "also , we note a clear reentrance of the biaxial regions for some choices of the parameters , which is agreement with the early work of alben for a lattice model of platelets @xcite .    in some recent publications , akpinar , reis , and figueiredo - neto @xcite@xcite reported x - ray and optical characterizations of biaxial nematic structures in a large class of quaternary liquid - crystalline mixtures . from these measurements , it has been possible to establish many novel phase diagrams in terms of temperature and molar fraction of the components , which represents a real advance with respect to the early work of yu and saupe for a ternary lyotropic mixture . for all concentrations of the amphiphile component ,",
    "if there is a nematic biaxial structure , it is thermodynamically stable at intermediate temperatures , between regions of different uniaxial nematic structures , at lower and higher temperatures .",
    "also there are examples of temperature - concentration phase diagrams with a clear indication of the existence of a landau multicritical point . with a suitable choice of parameters , the ms6 model of a binary mixtures",
    "can qualitatively reproduce all of these observations . in a very recent experimental investigation , amaral and coworkers",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the phase diagram of a ternary sds lyotropic mixture , and pointed out a peculiar coexistence of uniaxial and biaxial nematic structures , which still seems to demand a theoretical explanation .",
    "the present calculations , for the elementary ms6 lattice model , at the mean - field level , are a contribution to the understanding of the effects of shape fluctuations on the thermodynamic behavior of complex liquid - crystalline systems .",
    "the model of a binary mixture is sufficiently simple to produce a number of analytical and numerical results for a wide range of values of the molecular parameters .",
    "also , it seems to be possible to go beyond the mean - field scenario .",
    "the use of more powerful techniques may uncover additional aspects of the phase diagrams , in particular limitations of the mean - field approach at very low and very high concentrations ."
