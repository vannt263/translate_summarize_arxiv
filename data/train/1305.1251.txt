    "in the derivation , the first key point is that for a @xmath102 with either trs or phs , the symmetries can be preserved on the @xmath4 if it is chosen to be centrosymmetric with respect to the origin of @xmath5-space .",
    "secondly , it is crucial to observe that all six formulas for the topological charges of fss can formally be used to calculate the topological numbers of tis / tscs , where we make the integration over the whole @xmath5-space , in stead of making it over @xmath4 for an fs .",
    "the topological difference of symmetry identification plays an essential role in the derivation of the topological classification table of tis / tscs . in practical calculations for fss ,",
    "we use the following spherical coordinates for the chosen @xmath103 , @xmath104 with @xmath105 $ ] for @xmath106 and @xmath107 . without loss of generality",
    ", we have assumed that the fs is a fermi point with codimension @xmath3 in a @xmath108-dimensional @xmath5-space . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the class aii as an illustration , which has only trs with @xmath109 , while other seven classes can be treated in the same way and results are the same .",
    "the trs on the chosen @xmath103 with the spherical coordinates can be represented as @xmath110 note that the transformation of @xmath111 is different from those of the others .",
    "correspondingly , green s function @xmath112^{-1}$ ] is transformed as @xmath113 while the green s function for a ti in the class aii satisfies @xmath114 it is seen that that all @xmath115s of the ti reverse the signs under the trs transformation , which is in contrast to the situation of the chosen @xmath103 enclosing an fs where the last coordinate @xmath111 does not reverse its sign .",
    "we first illustrate how trs makes the @xmath7-type topological charge of an fs with codimension @xmath116 vanishing .",
    "the formula for the @xmath7-type topological charge with codimension @xmath117 is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "implementing the trs transformation , @xmath20 eq.([eq : trs - fs0 ] ) , and the coordinate substitution @xmath120 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , we have @xmath123 making a permutation that reverses the order of all the indices of @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath124 where the extra @xmath125 comes from the permutation .",
    "now it is clear that when @xmath126 with @xmath33 being an integer , @xmath20 @xmath116 , the @xmath7-type topological charge of an fs is vanished for the class aii . for the corresponding case of ti ,",
    "the procedure is almost the same .",
    "first , the integral form of topological number is the same as eq.([eq : topo - charge ] ) , but the integration is made over the whole @xmath5-space : @xmath127 in a similar way to the case of fs , we make the variable substitution @xmath128 , matrix transposition , and then a permutation to reverse all the indices of @xmath69 .",
    "the only difference is that when substituting the variables , we could not obtain an extra minus sign as that in the second equality of eq.([eq : partial - sign ] ) , since the number of partial derivatives of @xmath129 is even .",
    "thus we have @xmath130 which implies the topological number of a ti with @xmath131 in the class aii is always trivial , but that with @xmath32 can be nontrivial .    comparing eq.([eq : trs - ti ] ) with eq.([eq",
    ": trs - fs ] ) , we see clearly a one - dimension shift from @xmath132 to @xmath133 . from the established classification table of fss in class aii , we know that a sole but minor remaining uncertainty is whether the topological types of tis / tscs for @xmath134 are @xmath7 or @xmath34 , which can surely be fixed by examining an appropriately chosen case .",
    "since the dirac model of @xmath135 can have a unit topological charge belonging to @xmath7-type , the topological charges for @xmath134 is of @xmath7-type , and thus @xmath136 .",
    "the same results are obtained for the other seven classes due to the same reason .",
    "thus we show rigorously that @xmath137 , which reflects the topological difference between the @xmath0-space and the chosen @xmath103 to enclose an fs when the symmetry class is concerned .",
    "the boundary effective theory for a 3-dimensional ti reads @xmath138 where the term @xmath139 merely indicates that the hamiltonian in the class aii allows such term , which will turn out to be irrelevant for the topological charge of the fermi point .",

    "when we choose a circle in the @xmath159-plane , the green s function restricted on this circle is given by @xmath160 with @xmath161 .",
    "noting that trs for the green s function is @xmath162 , this trs is accordingly represented as @xmath163 on the circle .",

    "it turns out that there exist @xmath351 degenerate solutions with degeneracy originated from the internal space : @xmath352 where @xmath15 labels the @xmath351 degenerate eigenvectors of @xmath342 with eigenvalue @xmath353 .    to obtain the low - energy effective hamiltonian on the boundary , we consider the remaining terms along the other directions of eq.([eq : modify - dirac ] ) : @xmath354 as perturbations . since we are only interested in the low - energy behavior of the boundary , it is sufficient to implement the perturbation theory of quantum mechanics in this subspace with zero energy to obtain the low - energy effective hamiltonian @xmath355 , that is @xmath356 we first show that the quadratic terms vanish as follows .",
    "note that @xmath357 and @xmath358 as a result , @xmath359 , and thus the quadratic terms have no contribution to @xmath355 . for the linear terms of @xmath360 , noting that @xmath361=0,\\qquad for\\quad a\\ne1\\ ; or\\ ; b,\\ ] ] all @xmath362s with @xmath363 can be diagonalized into @xmath174 blocks as @xmath364 where each block satisfies @xmath365 thus either @xmath366 or @xmath367 forms a @xmath174 representation of the clifford algebra .",
    "thus up to a unitary transformation , we can express the effective theory as @xmath368 subject to the condition of eq.([eq : existence - condition ] ) .",
    "note that for @xmath34 cases , the first @xmath177 matrix in the above expression should be @xmath337 .",
    "it is a crucial to observate that the low - energy effective theory ( [ eq : effective - weyl ] ) , which is obtained on the boundary of the unified model ( [ eq : unified - ti ] ) of tis / tscs , takes also a unified form for all types of fss , @xmath20 , models ( [ eq : weyl - type ] ) , ( [ eq : first - weyl ] ) , ( [ eq : second - weyl ] ) , ( [ eq : fs-2z - nonchiral ] ) , ( [ eq : dirac - type ] ) , ( [ eq : fs - dirac - z2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : fs - dirac-2z ] ) . since our final aim is to prove the general index theorem , namely , to show that the same topological information is encoded in both bulk and boundary , our remaining task is to look into the topological charge of the fermi point with the obtained effective theory . to be explicit ,",
    "we shall complete two tasks : the first one is to identify the symmetry operators of a boundary effective theory according to those of its bulk hamiltonian ; the second one is to check whether the topological charge of the fermi point on the boundary matches the bulk topological number on both magnitude and topological type .",
    "the first one can be done by comparing the symmetries and their signs , and thereby it turns out that , for a given symmetry case , the corresponding symmetry operators are just those we defined previously in the constructions of that kind of fs with unit topological charge .",
    "this can be clearly seen from the fact that our constructions of fermi surfaces and tis / tscs matches to our classification table of both fss and tis / tscs , where the symmetry situation of an fs of codimension @xmath88 is the same as that of a @xmath16-dimensional ti / tsc . for the second task , again from our classification table of fss and tis / tscs , we see that the topological charge of the fermi point has the same type as that of the corresponding bulk topological number , and furthermore their numerical equality is obvious .",
    "thus we finally have the following general index theorem : @xmath369 where @xmath15 is the index of the symmetry classes , @xmath88 is the codimension of the fermi point on the boundary , and @xmath16 is the spatial dimension , for a concerned ti / tsc ."

    "<S> as is known , various kinds of tis / tscs , which possess the time - reversal symmetry(trs ) or / and particle - hole symmetry(phs ) , and chiral symmetry(cs ) , may be realised whenever the symmetry constraints on the bulk topology are enforced , while these symmetries can be preserved in the presence of weak disorders from a viewpoint of random matrix theory  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , these gapless modes are originated from a fact that the boundary of a ti / tsc as a domain wall separates the system in different topological phases , with topological order - parameters being identified as the bulk topological numbers . </S>",
    "<S> as it is generally believed that there exists a faithful bulk - boundary correspondence , the above wisdom is practically useful , while it is likely to provide a qualitative insight on topology merely from the bulk to boundary , rather than a complete and quantitative description of this topological correspondence . on the other hand , stimulated by volovik s pioneering work on topological fermi surfaces ( fss ) without any discrete symmetry  @xcite , a topological theory of fss </S>",
    "<S> has recently been established for describing many - fermion systems with trs or / and phs , where a nontrivial topological charge of an fs with a specific symmetry ensures its topological stability against symmetry - preserving weak disorders / perturbations and interactions  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> finally , we address briefly the predictions and restrictions on the boundary low - energy effective theories of tis / tscs .    </S>",
    "<S> let us begin with a brief introduction to topological fss . </S>",
    "<S> an fs is actually a region of fermionic gapless modes in the @xmath0-space of energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> some fss are stable against disorders / perturbations , while some others are vulnerable and easy to be gapped  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the topological charge of an fs is responsible for its stability  @xcite . for a @xmath1-dimensional fs in a @xmath2-dimensional @xmath0-space </S>",
    "<S> , we can choose a @xmath3-dimensional sphere @xmath4 from @xmath5-space to enclose it from its transverse dimensions , where @xmath3 is referred to as the codimension of the fs . </S>",
    "<S> note that the spectrum is gapped on the whole @xmath4 since the @xmath4 is constructed in the transverse dimensions of an fs . </S>",
    "<S> for an fs without any discrete symmetry , its topological charge is given by the homotopy number of the inverse green s function restricted on the @xmath4  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath6|_{s^p}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this idea has recently been generalized to fss of the other classes for characterising the corresponding types of symmetry - dependent topological charges  @xcite , as summarized in tab.[[tab : periodic - table ] ] ( in a left - to - right manner ) , where the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denote the integer - valued topological charge , @xmath10-valued ( integers of modular @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) topological charge for the first descendant of a @xmath7-type , and @xmath10-valued topological charge for the second descendant of a @xmath7-type .    </S>",

    "<S> cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now derive the relation between the classification of fss and that of tis / tscs , as indicated in tab.[[tab : periodic - table ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is crucial to observe that all six formulas for the topological charges of fss can formally be used to calculate the topological numbers of tis / tscs , where we make the integration over the whole @xmath5-space in these formulas@xcite , in stead of making it over @xmath4 for an fs , as illustrated in supplemental material  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> -space , and the right corresponds to an @xmath18 enclosing a fermi point in a three - dimensional @xmath0-space . [ fig : symmetry - identification ] ]    we emphasise here that the operation of trs and phs on the @xmath5-space of a ti / tsc is essentially different from that on an @xmath4 for an fs , as shown in fig.[[fig : symmetry - identification ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> if the symmetry operation is regarded as an identification , the resulting topological space of @xmath4 for an fs is a @xmath3-dimensional projective space @xmath19  @xcite , while that of @xmath0 space is not . </S>",
    "<S> this topological difference of symmetry operation leads to that the topological types of tis / tscs _ vs. _ the dimension @xmath16 have globally a one - dimension shift with respect to those of fss _ vs. _ the codimension @xmath3 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote , respectively , the topological types of fss ( with the codimension @xmath3 ) and tis / tscs ( with the spatial dimension @xmath16 ) in the @xmath15th class . without loss of generality , we below consider class aii ( @xmath24 ) and highlight the key steps in the derivation of this relation . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that in the absence of any discrete symmetry , fss with nontrivial topological charges can exist only when @xmath25 with @xmath26 being an integer  @xcite , and tis / tscs can have nontrivial topological numbers only when @xmath27 . after operations of the minus - sign trs on @xmath4 and @xmath5 space  @xcite , we obtain the following relations for fss and ti / tscs : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote respectively the topological charge of an fs ( with the codimension @xmath3 ) and the topological number of a ti / tsc ( with the dimension @xmath16 ) in the @xmath15th class if they are of @xmath7-type . </S>",
    "<S> it is found for class aii that nontrivial @xmath7-type ( or @xmath17-type ) fss can exist only when @xmath31 , while there are nontrivial @xmath7-type ( or @xmath17-type ) tis / tscs only if @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is an integer . since @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as the first and second descendants of @xmath7 , will follow @xmath7 successively when @xmath16 is reduced , our remaining task is to distinguish types of @xmath7 and @xmath34 for tis / tscs , which can be done for class aii as follows : noticing that fss are of @xmath7-type when @xmath35 , while tis / tscs , whose hamiltonians can be constructed by dirac matrices , possess unit topological number ( i.e. , @xmath7-type ) for @xmath36  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have @xmath37 . since similar derivations can be made for the other seven classes ( not shown here ) , eq.([eq : table - relation ] ) is rigorously deduced and therefore the classification table of tis / tscs is established , as presented in tab.[[tab : periodic - table ] ] in a right - to - left manner , which is one of our main results .    </S>",
    "<S> notably , a similar classification table of tis / tscs was first postulated by generalizing a pruiskein s theory for the integer quantum hall effect(iqhe)(without any above - mentioned symmetry ) to the other symmetry classes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pruiskein s theory is a non - linear @xmath38 model handling disorders , which attributes the stability of the gapless boundary modes to a topological wess - zumino - witten term on the boundary  @xcite . as a specific symmetry class has a unique group for its non - linear sigma model  @xcite , the classification in tab[[tab : periodic - table ] ] </S>",
    "<S> was postulated according to whether eligible topological terms can appear on the boundary of a system in each case  @xcite . while in the present work , first , it is shown rigorously that all types of the bulk topological numbers are just those ( with one - to - one correspondence ) for topological charges of fss identified in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , as seen in eq.([eq : table - relation ] ) ; secondly , the periodic table for tis / tscs is refined by classifying the two different topological types of @xmath39 , enabling us to choose a corresponding formula for calculating the topological charges correctly ; while no such distinction can be seen from the existing results  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been known from many examples that the boundary gapless modes of a given ti / tsc with one ( or more ) above symmetry are robust against disorders / perturbations that do not break the corresponding symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the fss corresponding to these gapless modes are actually protected by their nontrivial topological charge with the same symmetry class according to a theory of topologically stable fss  @xcite , while such robustness can also be attributed to a nontrivial topological number of bulk . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we attempt to find a quantitative relation between the topological number @xmath40 of a bulk ti / tsc and the topological charge @xmath41 of its boundary fss . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a @xmath16-dimensional semi - infinite ti / tsc of a symmetry class @xmath15 with a boundary being at @xmath42 on its left - side . under the natural boundary condition of the ti / tsc , i.e. </S>",
    "<S> , no dramatic anisotropy is induced and the symmetries in the @xmath15th class are preserved when the system approaches to its boundary , fss on the boundary will always be some fermi points in a topological sense . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is obviously valid for @xmath43 . in addition , its validity can also be extended to tis / tscs for @xmath44  @xcite . as a result , the boundary codimension @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> then by appropriately choosing an @xmath46 in the @xmath5 space of the boundary to enclose all the fss , we are able to compute the total topological charge @xmath47 of all fss . therefore , from eq.([eq : table - relation ] ) , which enables the same type of nontrivial topological charge of boundary fss and bulk number to protect the fss , we may expect a general index theorem as a quantitive topological description of the boundary - bulk correspondence of a ti / tsc : @xmath48 clearly , the above equation reflects essentially that the same topological origin protects both the stability of fss on the boundary and the gapped spectrum of bulk against disorders / perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we note that eq.([eq : index - theorem ] ) accounts for the earlier statements for classification of tis / tscs based on the random - matrix theory by assuming certain boundary topological terms in a non - linear @xmath38 model  @xcite , and reveals that the bulk topology can also be quantified by the topological charge of boundary fss . </S>",
    "<S> notably , a similar index theorem for systems without any symmetry was given in ref.@xcite , and has been generalized to other cases with either physical arguments or strict verifications for some concrete models  @xcite , though the topological charge of fss was not used explicitly .    </S>",
    "<S> to see eq.([eq : index - theorem ] ) more clearly , we first present two typical examples , with the proof to be given later . consider a 3-dimensional ti described by the dirac - lattice model @xcite , @xmath20 @xmath49 with @xmath50 being @xmath51 hermitian dirac matrices@xcite and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this model has trs with a minus sign and thus may have a non - trivial @xmath53-type , as seen from tab.[[tab : periodic - table ] ] @xmath54 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> its boundary effective model reads @xmath55 with @xmath56 being pauli matrices  @xcite , which preserves the same trs and has a fermi point with codimension @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> one can find that @xmath58  @xcite , verifying eq.([eq : index - theorem ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , another 2-dimensional model , which describes the quantum spin hall effect , is given by @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> it has also trs with a minus sign and therefore belongs to class aii with a @xmath60-type topological number . </S>",
    "<S> its boundary effective hamiltonian is @xmath61 , which has a fermi point ( @xmath62 ) with the same @xmath60-type topological charge . </S>",
    "<S> we can also find that @xmath63  @xcite .    at this stage </S>",
    "<S> , we turn to brief readers the proof of the general index theorem : eq.([eq : index - theorem ] ) , with more details being presented in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is seen from the topological nature of a ti / tsc that the total topological charge of fss on its boundary and the topological number of its bulk are both invariant under continuous deformations of its hamiltonian without closing the bulk spectrum gap . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , it is noted that hamiltonian of each type of fs ( point ) for a given codimension @xmath3 and class @xmath15 with a unit charge ( or double - unit charge for @xmath34 type ) can be expressed by dirac matrices in a unified form : @xmath64 where @xmath65 are @xmath66 dirac matrices , and @xmath67 is an integer that is specified by the corresponding topological type of the fs . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , a modified dirac - type model for each type of bulk ti / tsc with unit topological number(or double - unit for @xmath34 type ) can also be constructed in a unified form : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant , @xmath70 for @xmath34 cases and @xmath71 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath69 term is necessary for a prescription of the singularity of @xmath72 when @xmath73 approaches to infinity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model has a unified expression of the topological number for all types of tis / tscs : @xmath74 where the coefficient is @xmath13 for @xmath34 cases , and @xmath75 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> next , we proceed to consider an arbitrarily given ti / tsc in a certain type with the topological number @xmath76 , which can be deformed continuously to a model that is @xmath40-multiple ( or for @xmath34 cases , @xmath77-multiple ) of the model ( [ typical - ti ] ) , preserving the corresponding symmetries and without closing the bulk spectrum gap . after this deformation , both the bulk topological number and the total topological charge of boundary fss </S>",
    "<S> are preserved , as indicated above  @xcite , and therefore it is sufficient to consider the unit model ( [ typical - ti ] ) for proof of eq.([eq : index - theorem ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this deformation lies in that the boundary low - energy effective theory of the model ( [ typical - ti ] ) can be systematically derived by using a standard perturbation theory of quantum mechanics under the open boundary condition@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after some tedious derivations detailed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the boundary effective theory of the model ( [ typical - ti ] ) turns out to be @xmath78 for the boundary at @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the symmetries of the system are now represented in the boundary effective theory ( [ bet ] ) . by matching the symmetry representation of the theory ( [ bet ] ) to that of our constructed model ( [ typical - fs ] ) , we find that not only the topological charge of fermi point in the boundary effective theory ( [ bet ] ) is equal to the topological number of the model ( [ typical - ti ] ) , but also the topological type of the fs is the same as that of the bulk model ( [ typical - ti ] ) , namely , the general index theorem is validated@xcite . before concluding this paper , we address briefly implications of eq.([eq : index - theorem ] ) on the form of a boundary effective theory with a given bulk topological number . </S>",
    "<S> based on the atiyah - bott - singer(abs ) construction in k - theory and a fact that an fs of multiple charge can be perturbed to a more stable state consisting of a number of unit fss@xcite , we assert that a typical low - energy effective theory of boundary for a @xmath7 type ti / tsc is a collection of @xmath79 for non - chiral cases or @xmath80 for chiral cases , with the total topological charge being equal to the bulk topological number . on the other hand , for @xmath39 type tis / tscs , the constraint from abs construction is not as strong as that of the above cases , while the constraint on @xmath8 type is stronger than that on @xmath81 type , since the latter needs one more extra parameter . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , a boundary effective theory can still be constructed by dirac matrices , whose expression is not uniquely determined . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are both eligible as the boundary effective theory of a quantum spin hall system .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the topology - intrinsic connection between the stabilities of fss and tis / tscs has been revealed . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have proposed and proven a general index theorem , providing for the first time a quantitive description of the bulk - boundary correspondence of tis / tcss . </S>",
    "<S> it is anticipated that the present work will also provide a deeper insight and open a wider door for exploring exotic boundary gapless modes of tis / tscs such as majorana fermions .    </S>",
