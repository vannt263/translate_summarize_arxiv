    "charm production in cc dis is dominated by an @xmath2 transition at the virtual @xmath3-boson vertex .",
    "the @xmath4 background is sizable at large @xmath5 where the cabibbo suppression is balanced by the valence enhancement of @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath6 is well known i will not consider @xmath4 and assume a vanishing cabibbo angle for simplicity .",
    "the results presented here are , however , not affected by this choice .",
    "the lo production cross section of charmed hadrons @xmath7 manifests the obvious possibility to extract the nucleon s strange sea density @xmath8 and the charm fragmentation function @xmath9 from experimental data @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) @xmath5 and @xmath10 are the standard inclusive dis observables and @xmath11 ; @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the momentum of the charmed hadron , the target nucleon and the mediated gauge boson , respectively . in the target rest frame",
    "@xmath15 reduces to the charmed hadron energy @xmath16 scaled to its maximal value @xmath17 . in the massless parton model the fractional momentum",
    "@xmath18 of the struck strange quark reduces to the bjorken variable @xmath5 . for theoretical predictions to be reliable",
    "one has of course to consider the nlo of the qcd perturbation series where @xmath19 ( incl .",
    "virtual corrections ) and @xmath20 contributions enter the game . the nlo terms mix quark and gluon initiated contributions and induce a scheme dependence due to the necessity of handling collinear divergencies arising from on - shell strange quark propagators .",
    "most prominent choices are the dimensionally regularized ( @xmath21 )  scheme and the massive ( @xmath22 ) acot formalism @xcite for heavy quarks .    in principle",
    "also @xmath23 seems measurable at a polarized hera setup @xcite and the corresponding nlo framework is underway @xcite .",
    "at nlo the production cross section is no longer of the simple factorized form of eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) and double convolutions ( symbol @xmath24 below ) have to be considered @xcite .",

    "\\simeq & s(\\chi)\\ { \\cal{d}}_{x , q^2}[d_c](z )   \\label{kfactor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] holds    also at nlo accuracy within experimental errors and for the limited kinematical range of present data on neutrinoproduction of charm . in eq .",
    "( [ kfactor ] ) the approximate multiplicative factor @xmath26 absorbs the precise @xmath27-factor @xmath28 obtained from a full nlo qcd calculation @xcite .",
    "@xmath26 is _ not _ a simple universal fragmentation function but a nontrivial process - dependent functional which is , however , mainly sensitive on @xmath29 and shows little sensitivity on the exact parton distributions considered .",
    "the occurrence of @xmath30 and @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ kfactor ] ) as indices and as a functional argument , respectively , reflects the fact that the dependence on @xmath5 and @xmath31 is much weaker than is on @xmath15 .",
    "( [ kfactor ] ) tells us that @xmath8 fixes the normalization of @xmath32 once @xmath27 is known . on the other hand @xmath27 ( or @xmath26 )",
    "can be computed @xcite from @xmath29 with little sensitivity on @xmath8 , such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 decouple in the production dynamics and can be simultaneously extracted .",
    "this point can be clearly inferred from fig .",
    "1 where it is shown for ccfr @xcite ( fixed target ) kinematics that the nlo calculations @xcite using grv94 @xcite ( solid ) and cteq4 @xcite ( dashed ) strange seas can be brought into good agreement by a mere change of the normalization given by the ratio @xmath33 ( dot - dashed ) . the freedom in realizing eq .",
    "( [ kfactor ] ) in distinct nlo schemes , e.g.  or acot , might a priori lead to an ambiguity in measuring the nucleon s strangeness . from fig .",
    "2 one can , however , see that the scheme dependence is small @xcite for the inclusive ( z - integrated ) charm structure function @xmath34 .",
    "this result does also hold for the semi - inclusive structure functions entering eq .",
    "( [ kfactor ] ) @xcite , as can be judged comparing the @xmath21 and @xmath35 curves in the upper half of fig .  4 below .",
    "the wide spread of available strange sea densities is illustrated by some of its representatives @xcite in fig .",
    "it is especially interesting to note the difference -not only in size but also in shape- of the characteristically steep strange sea of grv94 which builds up entirely through a renormalization group resummation of @xmath36 splittings from a low resolution scale @xmath37 and the conventional strange seas of cteq4 and ccfr which comprise an additional nonperturbative input component at larger @xmath38 . comparing the solid ( grv94 ) and the dashed ( cteq4 ) curves in fig .",
    "1 with the parametrization @xcite of ccfr production data a purely radiative strange sea seems to be favored over larger nonperturbative inputs which overshoot data at larger @xmath5 .",
    "this conclusion is awaiting further experimental analyses and it would be helpful to have published production data at hand for future investigations .",
    "since the cross section in eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) is directly proportional to @xmath29 at lo accuracy neutrinoproduction of charm can give valuable information on the charm ff complementary to that from one charmed hadron inclusive @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "especially a test of the universality of the charm fragmentation function is an important issue @xcite . in fig .  1",
    "a scale - independent peterson @xcite ff with a hardness parameter of @xmath39 has been used .",
    "this choice seems to be compatible with the neutrino data band . on the other hand",
    "a distinctly harder value of @xmath40 has been obtained in @xcite from lep and argus @xmath0 data , see also @xcite for related analyses .",
    "if the fit of @xcite is evolved down to fixed target energies it is incompatible with the parametrized neutrino data in fig .  1 .",
    "a point which might influence the extraction of a universal ff from neutrinoproduction is the scheme dependence in handling final state quasi - collinear logarithms @xmath41 . along the lines of @xcite",
    "they may be resummed into a running of the charm ff as has been done in @xcite or they may be kept at fixed order as in @xcite using a scale - independent ff . in fig .  4 we examine such resummation effects for ccfr kinematics .",
    "we use the same peterson ff with @xmath39 once for a fixed order calculation @xcite ( solid lines ) and once as the nonperturbative input part of the running @xmath42 ff ( dashed curves ) .",
    "we note that towards intermediate scales around @xmath43 one begins to see the softening effects of the resummation which are enhanced as compared to the fixed order calculation .",
    "however , as one would expect at these scales , the resummation effects are moderate and can not explain the descrepancy between the @xmath44 values .",
    "however , charm fragmentation at lep has been measured by tagging on @xmath45 s , whereas neutrinoproduction experiments observe mainly @xmath46 s through their semileptonic decay - channel ( dimuon events ) .",
    "argus @xcite and cleo @xcite data at @xmath47 indeed show @xcite a harder energy distribution of @xmath45 s compared to @xmath46 s .",
    "it seems therefore to be possible within experimental accuracy to observe a nondegeneracy of the charm fragmentation functions into the lowest charmed pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "we note that an @xmath44 value around @xmath48 which is in agreement with neutrino data on @xmath46-production is also compatible with the @xmath46 energy spectrum measured at argus where the evolution may be performed either using fixed order expressions in @xcite or via a rg transformation along the lines of @xcite .",
    "if forthcoming experimental analyses should confirm our findings the lower decade @xmath49 argus@xmath50 may be added to the evolution path argus@xmath51lep@xmath52 paved in @xcite for the charm ff .",
