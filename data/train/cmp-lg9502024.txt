    "show that people are used to write same meaningful sentences differently .",
    "in addition , people are prone to mistakes in writing sentences .",
    "so , the bulk of written sentences are open to the extragrammaticality .    in the penn treebank",
    "tree - tagged  corpus@xcite , for instance , about 80 percents of the rules are concerned with peculiar sentences which include inversive , elliptic , parenthetic , or emphatic phrases . for example , we can drive a rule _",
    "vp @xmath1 vb np comma rb comma pp _  from the following sentence .    ....",

    "however , if we try to preserve robustness by adding such rules whenever we encounter an extragrammatical sentence , the rulebase will grow up rapidly , and thus processing and maintaining the excessive number of rules will become inefficient and impractical . therefore , extragrammatical sentences should be handled by some recovery mechanism(s ) rather than by a set of additional rules .",
    "many researchers have attempted several techniques to deal with extragrammatical sentences such as augmented transition network(atn ) @xcite , network - based semantic grammar @xcite , partial pattern matching @xcite , conceptual case frame @xcite , and multiple cooperating methods @xcite . above mentioned techniques",
    "take into account various semantic factors depending on specific domains on question in recovering extragrammatical sentences . whereas they can provide even better solutions intrinsically , they are usually ad - hoc and are lack of extensibility . therefore , it is important to recover extragrammatical sentences using syntactic factors only , which are independent of any particular system and any particular domain .",
    "mellish @xcite introduced some chart - based techniques using only syntactic information for extragrammatical sentences .",
    "this technique has an advantage that there is no repeating work for the chart to prevent the parser from generating the same edge as the previously existed edge .",
    "also , because the recovery process runs when a normal parser terminates unsuccessfully , the performance of the normal parser does not decrease in case of handling grammatical sentences .",
    "however , his experiment was not based on the errors in running texts but on artificial ones which were randomly generated by human .",
    "moreover , only one word error was considered though several word errors can occur simultaneously in the running text .    _ a general algorithm for least - errors recognition _ @xcite , proposed by g. lyon , is to find out the least number of errors necessary to successful parsing and recover them . because this algorithm is also syntactically oriented and based on a chart , it has the same advantage as that of mellish s parser .",
    "when the original parsing algorithm terminates unsuccessfully , the algorithm begins to assume errors of insertion , deletion and mutation of a word . for any input , including grammatical and extragrammatical sentences , this algorithm can generate the resultant parse tree .",
    "at the cost of the complete robustness , however , this algorithm degrades the efficiency of parsing , and generates many intermediate edges .    in this paper",
    ", we present a robust parser with a recovery mechanism .",
    "we extend _ the general algorithm for least - errors recognition _ to adopt it as the recovery mechanism in our robust parser . because our robust parser handle extragrammatical sentences with this syntactic information oriented recovery mechanism , it can be independent of a particular system or particular domain .",
    "also , we present the heuristics to reduce the number of edges so that we can upgrade the performance of our parser .    this paper is organized as follows : we first review a general algorithm for least - errors recognition .",
    "then we present the extension of this algorithm , and the heuristics adopted by the robust parser .",
    "next , we describe the implementation of the system and the result of the experiment of parsing real sentences .",
    "finally , we make conclusion with future direction .",
    "the general algorithm for least - errors recognition @xcite , which is based on earley s algorithm , assumes that sentences may have insertion , deletion , and mutation errors of terminal symbols .",
    "the objective of this algorithm is to parse input string with the least number of errors .",

    "by these heuristics , our robust parser can process only plausible edges first , instead of processing all generated edges at the same time , so that we can enhance the performance of the robust parser and result in the great reduction in the number of resultant trees .",
    "our robust parsing system is composed of two modules .",

    "for example , if people tend to write sentences with inserted phrases , then the parameter @xmath18 must increase .",
    "therefore we can get better results if the parameter are fitted to the characteristics of the corpus .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the robust parser with the extended least - errors recognition algorithm as the recovery mechanism .",
    "this robust parser can easily be scaled up and applied to various domains because this parser depends only on syntactic factors . to enhance the performance of the robust parser for extragrammatical sentences",
    ", we proposed several heuristics .",
    "the heuristics assign the error values to each error - hypothesis edge , and edges which has less error values are processed first .",
