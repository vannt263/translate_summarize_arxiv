    "was analyzed with @xmath3-matrix approaches and dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "later , coupled - channel approaches with chiral su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite have been applied , and confirmed the @xmath0 quasi - bound picture of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , a recent lattice qcd analysis supports this picture based on the vanishing of the strange magnetic form factor  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 molecule picture indicates that the spacial structure of @xmath2 is relatively larger than the usual hadronic scale , which is shown by several approaches  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath2 signal in the @xmath4 spectrum has been studied with various reactions  @xcite .",
    "another interesting example is the antikaon bound states in nuclei , the @xmath1-nuclei  @xcite . because of the strong @xmath0 attraction , the @xmath1-nuclei may exhibit the qualitatively different structure from the normal nuclei .",
    "experimentally , there have been some claims for the evidence of the @xmath5 state  @xcite .",
    "for instance , j - parc e27 experiment has reported a broad enhancement in the proton coincidence missing mass spectra in the @xmath6 reaction at 1.69 gev/@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "however , we have to note that quantitative results of these experiments are not consistent with each other . furthermore there are experiments which have found no such quasi - bound structure  @xcite . to draw a definite conclusion ,",

    "it is the @xmath0 interaction below the threshold that is essential for the calculations of @xmath1-nuclear systems .",
    "however , the subthreshold region can not be directly accessible by experiments , so we have to extrapolate the scattering amplitude constrained by the experimental data above the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "previous studies of the @xmath1-nuclei have suffered from the large uncertainty , mainly because the experimental data has not been sufficient to constrain the subthreshold amplitude .",
    "recently , the siddharta collaboration has measured the precise energy - level shift of the kaonic hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "this data is related to the @xmath9 scattering length @xcite , which quantitatively constrains the scattering amplitude at the @xmath0 threshold .",

    "thanks to the systematic improvement , the low energy @xmath11 total cross sections , threshold branching ratios , and the siddharta data are well reproduced with an accuracy of @xmath10  @xcite . the potential is constructed in the local form in the coordinate space for the convenience of the applications to few - body calculations .",
    "in contrast to the nuclear force , the @xmath0 potential can not be directly obtained in chiral perturbation theory which does not contain the long range meson exchange processes .",
    "we therefore construct the potential so as to reproduce the scattering amplitude from chiral unitary approach on the real energy axis following ref .",
    "given that the uncertainty of the subthreshold amplitude is reduced by the siddharta constraint , we have to establish the construction procedure with the high precision in the wide energy region .",
