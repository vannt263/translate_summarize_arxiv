    "the study of hyperon resonances ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) is motivated , in part , by our relatively poor knowledge of their properties @xcite compared to those of non - strange baryons ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances ) and also by the quest to enhance the understanding of the role of confinement in the non - perturbative region .",
    "most prior partial - wave analyses @xcite assumed a simple energy - dependent parametrization for the partial - wave amplitudes ( typically , a sum of breit - wigner resonances plus polynomial backgrounds ) .",
    "such a parametrization introduces a model - dependent bias and results in a violation of unitarity of the partial - wave @xmath1-matrix .",
    "one of the disturbing features that appears when examining the partial waves obtained from these is that they do not always join smoothly with the partial waves given in analyses done for the same channel over a different energy range . among these works ,",
    "one of the arguably more sophisticated partial - wave analyses was that done by gopal _",
    "they analyzed world data available at that time for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 in the c.m .",
    "energy range from 1480 to 2170 mev . in their analysis",
    ", parallel single - channel analyses were performed using the energy - dependent technique discussed above .",
    "that is , an attempt was made to obtain consistent resonance parameters in all reactions , but independent backgrounds were allowed in each channel . in their work , a conventional energy - dependent analysis was performed first for each of the three two - body channels .",
    "the presence of a resonance in a partial wave was , as usual , detected by comparing the goodness of fit .",
    "the wave was parametrized as a smooth background to the alternative fit when a breit - wigner was added to the background .",
    "the three separate fits were then considered together in order to obtain a real multichannel analysis that required the masses and widths of the resonances be the same in each channel .",
    "the final fits were done with resonance parameters fixed and equal to a `` weighted average '' of the three values .",
    "there are several shortcomings in the parametrization used by gopal _",
    "et al._. firstly , it is inconsistent with unitarity .",
    "secondly , it does not treat background consistently in different channels .",
    "thirdly , it is unable to allow for cusp effects associated with such channels as @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "fourthly , it fails to handle threshold effects consistently for all partial waves ( through the barrier - penetration factors ) .",
    "finally , pole positions ( i.e. , pole mass and width ) of resonances were not determined .",
    "the main goal of the present work was to extract resonance parameters from a unitary , multichannel partial - wave analysis of @xmath11 scattering reactions .",
    "our approach is different and unique in the sense that it uses a generalized energy - dependent breit - wigner parametrization of amplitudes treating all the channels on an equal footing and taking full account of non - resonant backgrounds .",
    "the main advantage of using a multichannel partial - wave analysis to extract resonance parameters is that several reactions can be described simultaneously using a consistent set of resonance parameters for all reactions , all without violating unitarity of the partial - wave @xmath1-matrix .",
    "furthermore , small signals for a resonance in one reaction channel might be overlooked , whereas if similar signals appear in several channels , there is a good chance that the resonance can be identified and its parameters measured .",
    "the channels included in this analysis are @xmath0 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "we begin with an energy - dependent model for fitting of the @xmath0 partial - wave data .",
    "our detailed partial - wave analyses of reactions @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the reliability of the energy - dependent amplitudes extracted from this work was tested by using the fitted amplitudes to compare with various observables .",
    "our solution was in good agreement with available data for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the ksu model , developed by manley @xcite , employs a unitary multichannel parameterization to extract resonance parameters .",
    "it has been successfully used to extract @xmath21 and @xmath22 parameters from a combined fit of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the present work has utilized the model to extract the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters from multichannel fits of @xmath28 scattering amplitudes @xcite .    in the ksu model ,",
    "the partial - wave @xmath1-matrix is parametrized as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the corresponding partial - wave @xmath30-matrix . here",
    "@xmath31 is a unitary , symmetric , and generalized multichannel breit - wigner matrix while @xmath32 and its transpose @xmath33 are unitary matrices describing non - resonant background .",
    "the background matrix @xmath32 is constructed from a product of unitary matrices : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a very small interger .",
    "further details about the amplitude parametrization can be found in refs .",
    "the amplitudes for the multichannel energy - dependent fit were obtained from various partial - wave analyses .",
    "our energy - dependent fit included the cameron78 solution for @xmath36 @xcite , the cameron77 solution for @xmath37 @xcite , the cameron78 solution for @xmath38 @xcite , and the litchfield74 solution for @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we included our single - energy amplitudes for @xmath18 , @xmath40 , and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "previous single - channel analyses @xcite of @xmath41 , @xmath20 , and @xmath42 were simplistic energy - dependent pwas that failed to satisfy @xmath1-matrix unitarity .",
    "a multichannel energy - dependent fit was performed in the c.m .",
    "energy range @xmath43 from 1480 to 2170 mev .",
    "initially some approximately known fitting parameters were held fixed to yield a good fit . in some partial waves , @xmath44 and @xmath45 channels",
    "were included as dummy channels ( channels without data ) to satisfy unitarity .",
    "the @xmath46 channel was included for the @xmath47 partial wave by fitting data @xcite for @xmath48 up to a c.m .",
    "energy of 1685 mev .",
    "in addition , the @xmath49 channel was included as a dummy channel for the @xmath50 partial wave .",
    "the fitting parameters for each resonance were breit - wigner masses @xmath51 , and decay amplitudes @xmath52 , given by the signed square roots of the partial widths . in our final fits , uncertainties in resonance parameters were calculated with all fitting parameters free to vary .",
    "uncertainties were propagated into all resonance parameters using the full error matrix for each fit .",
    "the resonance parameters for states with @xmath53 and @xmath54 are listed in tables i and ii , respectively .",
    "the first column lists the resonance name together with the resonance mass and its total width in mev .",
    "the total width is just the sum of the partial widths : @xmath55 . for a given resonance , the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 listed in tables i and ii",
    "were evaluated at the energy @xmath58 .",
    "the first column also gives the pdg star rating @xcite of each resonance .",
    "the second column lists the fitted decay channels , starting with the @xmath0 elastic channel .",
    "sometimes subscripts appear with a channel notation ( e.g. @xmath59 ) ; here the first subscript is twice the total intrinsic spin ( 2s ) and the second subscript denotes the orbital angular momentum of the channel . the third column in table i or ii lists the partial decay widths ( @xmath57 ) associated with the corresponding channels .",
    "the symbol @xmath60 in the fourth column denotes the branching ratio for a given channel .",
    "finally , the @xmath61 and @xmath62 represent the ratio of elastic partial width and partial width for the @xmath63 channel respectively to the total width . any resonance included above 2.1 gev had its mass parameter initially fixed and resonance parameters for these states",
    "are generally not listed .",
    "the uncertainties of the resonance parameters in tables i and ii were conservatively increased by a factor of @xmath64 if @xmath65 , where @xmath66 was the @xmath67 per degree of freedom for the fit .",
    "figures 1 - 3 show representative argand diagrams for @xmath53 partial waves ( @xmath68 ) and figs . 4 - 7 show representative argand diagrams for @xmath69 partial waves ( @xmath70 , and @xmath71 ) .",
    "the argand diagrams display the energy dependence of the partial - wave @xmath30-matrix amplitudes .",
    "the relationship between the @xmath30-matrix and the unitary partial - wave @xmath1-matrix is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is an identity matrix . for the case of a single resonance in the absence of background",
    ", a @xmath30-matrix amplitude traces out a counter - clockwise circle on the argand diagram .",
    "for that simple case , the breit - wigner mass of the resonance corresponds to the c.m .",
    "energy in which the real part of the amplitude vanishes and the magnitude of the imaginary part is maximum . for elastic ( @xmath74 ) amplitudes , the value of the imaginary part of the amplitude at resonance corresponds to the elasticity , @xmath61 , of the resonance ( here , the @xmath28 branching fraction ) .",
    "more generally , for a single resonance in the absence of background , the value of imaginary part of the @xmath30-matrix amplitude at resonance is @xmath75 . for inelastic amplitudes ,",
    "the sign of @xmath75 is positive or negative depending on the sign of the amplitude at resonance . for more realistic situations in which there are two or more resonances and non - resonant background ,",
    "the appearance of argand diagrams becomes more complex and one must rely on fits in order to be able to extract resonance parameters . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the results of our multichannel fits that take these considerations into account . to discuss the resonance parameters we follow a logical sequence of partial waves .",
    "+                                @xmath76 : + this partial wave was fitted with four resonances .",
    "among which , the first resonance @xmath77 lies below @xmath11 threshold and nearly everything about it was learned from production experiments @xcite .",
