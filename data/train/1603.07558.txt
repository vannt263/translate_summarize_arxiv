    "this paper is largely focused on the known fact that the presence of charged spectator systems in non - central heavy ion collisions gives birth to a sizeable electromagnetic field . in our earlier works devoted to different observables like charge - dependent pion yields or directed flow  @xcite we found that this phenomenon provided new information on the space - time evolution of the system of hot and dense matter created in the reaction .",
    "an evident question emerged whether such information could be exploited as a `` new femtoscopy '' , based on effects other than particle interferometry .    below this issue",
    "will be reviewed and interpreted in the context of another well known phenomenon which is `` non - direct '' pion production from intermediate hadronic resonances .",
    "the very well defined , precise character of the electromagnetic ( em ) interaction , in contrast to the non - perturbative strong force , gives the hope of obtaining new space - time information that would be no- or little model - dependent .",
    "a first discussion of this item will be made below in the context of the present phenomenological and experimental situation .",
    "ratios in peripheral pb+pb reactions as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite , compared to ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) corresponding simulated @xmath3 ratios for different assumed values of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath0 excluded by experimental data are indicated in the plot .",
    "( f ) dependence of @xmath0 on pion rapidity ( data points ) , compared to the results of our monte carlo simulation described in section  [ characteristics ] .",
    "( g ) same as above , with the addition of results of three supplementary analyses using different input characteristics for the assumed mix of parent resonances .",
    "( h ) schematic definition of @xmath0 .",
    "( i ) illustration of resonances produced instantly at the moment of the collision ( @xmath4 ) and ( j ) produced from an intermediate system with a given proper lifetime @xmath5.,width=415,height=495 ]",
    "three basic datasets on charge dependence of particle production served as input for the present study .",
    "these were charged pion ratio na49  @xcite and wa98 positive pion directed flow  @xcite data from pb+pb reactions at @xmath6  gev , as well as charge - dependent pion directed flow in au+au reactions at @xmath7  gev  @xcite from the star experiment ( rhic beam energy scan ) .",
    "the data were interpreted by means of a simplified one - point pion emission model , where the propagation of charged pions through the spectator em field was numerically computed using classical relativistic equations of motion  @xcite .",
    "the results of this analysis appeared sensitive to the `` pion emission distance '' @xmath0 between the pion emission point and the spectator system , see fig .",
    "[ figx](h ) .",
    "consequently , the first information on the evolution of @xmath0 as a function of pion rapidity was obtained .",
    "an example of our studies for the case of na49 data is presented in fig .",
    "[ figx ] , where the @xmath3 ratios measured at high pion rapidities ( @xmath8 , panel ( a ) ) were used to eliminate wrong space - time scenarios defined by too small or too large values of @xmath0 ( panels ( b)-(e ) ) .",
    "a summary of the presently available information on @xmath0 as a function of pion rapidity is given in fig .",
    "[ figx](f ) where the lower , intermediate and high values of @xmath9 correspond to star @xmath10 data , na49 charged pion ratios , and wa98 @xmath10 data , respectively .",
    "the sizeable error bars apparent for the data points in the figure correspond to our present best estimate of conceptual as well as experimental uncertainties .",
    "improvement in both domains is realistically possible , also in view of the new experimental program proposed by the na61 experiment at cern  @xcite .",
    "independently of the above , two distinct features in the rapidity dependence of the distance between the pion at freeze - out and the corresponing position of spectator system are apparent : ( a ) its decrease as a function of rapidity and ( b ) the non - zero value of @xmath0 for pions moving at spectator rapidities",
    ". both issues will be addressed below .",
    "a basically model - independent feature of low - momentum transfer processes is `` resonance dominance '' in particle production  @xcite .",
    "based on that we performed a simple monte carlo study , assuming the bulk of pions to be produced from low - lying resonances like @xmath11 or @xmath12 ( or other baryonic and mesonic states with roughly similar characteristics ) . the resulting prediction for @xmath0 as a function of pion rapidity",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ figx](f ) as dashed blue curve , for a mix of @xmath13 and @xmath14 resonances produced instantly at the interaction point as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ figx](i ) . while this prediction gives a qualitative agreement with the decrease of @xmath0 with @xmath9 which we obtained from electromagnetic effects , a quantitative disagreement with these values is evident in spite of large error bars associated to the data points .",
    "a full quantitative agreement is obtained if , unlike in the precedent case , the parent resonances are not produced instantly , but the existence of an _ intermediate system prior to resonance formation _ is postulated in our study as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ figx](j ) .",
    "this is shown by red crosses in fig .",
    "[ figx](f ) .",
    "assuming , within sizeable uncertainities , the proper lifetime of this system to be of the order of @xmath15  fm / c for the considered range of collision energies , our toy monte carlo properly describes not only the decrease of @xmath0 with @xmath9 but also its non - zero value at beam rapidity , which then appears as a direct consequence of pion feed - over from resonance production .",
    "* we conclude * that spectator - induced em effects indeed provide an independent evidence for the existence of an intermediate system of ( presumably hot and dense ) matter in heavy ion collisions , and can be used to evaluate both its life - time and its longitudinal evolution up to high rapidities .",
    "this `` new femtoscopy '' remains completely autonomous from hbt information ; the proper lifetime of this `` intermediate system prior to resonance formation '' postulated above corresponds to a final time of pion emission of @xmath16  * fm / c * ( both value and error are our first and preliminary estimates ) . for comparison ,",
    "the compilation of pion decoupling times as presented in the published hbt analysis by the alice collaboration  @xcite gives , for the same range of collision energies , a value of approximatively @xmath17  fm / c .",
    "several sources can be claimed to induce uncertainties to the preliminary analysis presented above .",
    "a possibly important phenomenological error source is the lack of full experimental knowledge on all the baryonic / mesonic resonances building up final state pion production . an attempt to estimate the corresponding uncertainty is presented in fig .  [ figx](g ) .",
    "while our study shown in fig .",
    "[ figx](f ) is performed on the basis of experimental knowledge on yields and kinematical distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 resonances in p+p collisions  @xcite , including an estimate of baryon stopping from p+p to a+a reactions as well as proper resonance lifetimes , breit - wigner distributions , etc .",
    ", other analyses assuming different baryonic / mesonic contributions to the resonance mix or different parent @xmath18 and @xmath2 distributions bring similar results in the pion rapidity range presently available to our studies of em interactions .",
    "thus we provisionaly conclude that the lack of precise information on resonance distributions is unlikely to constitute a serious obstacle for obtaining new information on the space - time evolution of the system via spectator - induced electromagnetic effects .",
