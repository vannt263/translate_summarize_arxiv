    "the annihilation decay of heavy quarkonium involves several distance scales .",
    "the annihilation of the heavy - quark pair is a short - distance process occurring at length scales of order @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "the probability that the heavy - quark pair will be close enough to annihilate is determined by the wavefunction of the heavy quarkonium , which is dominated by distances of order @xmath8 or larger , where @xmath9 is the typical relative velocity of the heavy quark .",
    "the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism@xcite is a systematic framework for separating the effects of the scale @xmath7 from effects of lower momentum scales .",
    "the annihilation decay rate is factored into short - distance coefficients and long - distance nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "the short - distance coefficients can be calculated using perturbative qcd as a power series in the strong coupling constant @xmath10 at the scale of the heavy quark mass .",
    "the matrix elements are nonperturbative , but scale in a definite way with @xmath9 .",

    ", the short - distance coefficient for each matrix element can be calculated to any desired order in @xmath11 by matching the nrqcd effective theory with full qcd .",
    "one might hope that any desired precision could be obtained by carrying out the matching calculations to sufficiently high order in @xmath11 .",
    "however , large numbers may arise in high order calculations through the factorial growth of the coefficients in the perturbation series .",
    "a factorially growing series , when truncated at a high order , may produce a large error even if the coupling constant is small .",
    "this may limit the possibility of obtaining sufficiently precise results by performing the perturbative calculations to higher orders .",
    "one can investigate the asymptotic behavior of a series @xmath12 by studying its borel transform @xmath13 .",
    "a singularity in the borel parameter @xmath14 is called a renormalon@xcite .",
    "a renormalon gives rise to @xmath15 growth of the coefficients in the power series for @xmath12 so that its radius of convergence is 0 .",
    "if the renormalon is on the negative real axis , borel resummation can be used to recover the function uniquely from the divergent series .",
    "if the renormalon is on the positive real axis , the sum of the divergent series is not unique and there is an ambiguity in the function @xmath12 .",
    "the renormalons that are responsible for the factorial growth of coefficients in the perturbation series for qcd have been extensively studied .",
    "important applications include the operator product expansion for @xmath16 annihilation and @xmath17 decay@xcite and heavy quark effective theory@xcite .",

    "ii , we calculate the short - distance coefficients for the electromagnetic annihilation decays @xmath4 and @xmath19 at tree level .",
    "we present a new method for calculating the tree - level short - distance coefficients which involves expanding nonlocal qcd matrix elements in terms of local qcd matrix elements , and then using a foldy - wouthuysen - tani transformation to express them in terms of nrqcd matrix elements . in section iii",
    ", we calculate the borel transforms of the short - distance coefficients of the leading matrix elements in the large-@xmath2 limit . in section iv",
    ", we study the renormalons in the short - distance coefficients .",
    "we show that there is a universal borel resummable renormalon related to the cancellation of the coulomb singularity .",
    "we demonstrate that the ambiguities from the first infrared renormalon are canceled by ambiguities in the matrix elements that contribute through relative order @xmath3 .",
    "we also deduce the leading renormalons for the decay @xmath20 .",
    "finally , in section v , we use our calculations to estimate higher order radiative corrections to the decay rates for @xmath0 , @xmath21 , and @xmath5 .",
    "in this section , we review the nrqcd factorization formalism as it applies to electromagnetic annihilation decays .",

    "this removes the pinch singularity , and therefore these terms have no pole at @xmath438 .",
    "the residue of the @xmath445 renormalon is universal for all color - singlet @xmath18-wave quarkonium annihilation decays .",
    "the universality follows from the fact that in the low - momentum region of the loop integral for the qcd amplitude ( [ borel - coulm:1 ] ) , the @xmath59 annihilation amplitude can be approximated by a vertex @xmath446 that is independent of the loop momentum and nonzero for @xmath18-wave annihilation .",
    "the low - momentum regions of the qcd loop integral and the corresponding nrqcd loop integral must match .",

    "this ambiguity arises because summing the series of loop diagrams with bubble chains inserted into the gluon propagator is equivalent to replacing the strong coupling constant by a running coupling constant at the scale of the gluon momentum .",
    "however , the perturbative running coupling constant has a landau pole at the momentum scale @xmath462 .",
    "this pole appears in the integration region and therefore gives rise to an ambiguity in the loop integral .",
    "the renormalon ambiguity implies that the short - distance coefficients defined by minimal subtraction necessarily have some sensitivity to nonperturbative effects involving the energy scale @xmath462 .",
    "the infrared renormalons give ambiguities in the short - distance coefficients in nrqcd factorization formulas .",
    "the decay rates for @xmath463 and @xmath1 and the matrix elements in ( [ coe - a])-([coe - p ] ) are physical quantities , so they can not have any ambiguities .",

    "since infrared renormalons arise from small momentum scales , any ambiguities in the coefficients due to infrared renormalons must be compensated by corresponding ambiguities in the nonperturbative matrix elements .",
    "thus it must be possible to consistently absorb the ambiguities proportional to @xmath192 in ( [ c - u:1/2:2 ] ) for @xmath465 , @xmath466 , @xmath47 , @xmath313 and @xmath345 into various nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "the ambiguities in a coefficient from an infrared renormalon at @xmath467 , where @xmath468 is an integer , is proportional to @xmath469 .",
    "since the nrqcd matrix elements involve several different scales , it is not immediately obvious which matrix element an ambiguity proportional to @xmath470 should be absorbed into .",
    "we will make a simple hypothesis that is consistent with the velocity - scaling rules of nrqcd and verify that the ambiguities due to the @xmath471 renormalon are consistent with this hypothesis .",
