    "_ topological order _ - topologically ordered systems have gained wide attention in recent years due to some of its consequences in topological quantum computation and emergence of new phases of matter among many others  @xcite . among the different types of systems exhibiting topological order the ones with long - ranged entangled ( lre ) ground states are the ones which are thought to be most useful for quantum computation .",
    "the earliest proposals of such systems are the quantum double hamiltonians of kitaev  @xcite .",
    "the _ toric code _ is the simplest example of a @xmath3 lattice systems which contains anyons as low energy excitations and have degenerate lre states as ground states , this model consists of spin variables living on the links of a square lattice .",
    "these were further generalized by the levin - wen models  @xcite or the string - net models which described more general anyonic excitations by directly taking a unitary fusion category as inputs .",
    "these models are also quantum double models based on weak hopf algebras as noted in  @xcite and can thus be constructed via the algorithm of kitaev .",
    "topological codes have also been considered on manifolds with boundary @xcite .",
    "several other models inspired by the usefulness of the toric code as a stabilizer code have been constructed of which the topological color codes  @xcite are an example which have also been experimentally implemented  @xcite .",
    "_ state sum constructions and statistical mechanical models _ - both the levin - wen model and toric code models can be thought of as hamiltonian realizations of topological field theories ( tqfts ) and then they can be formulated in terms of topological invariants .",
    "state sum constructions of tqft s @xcite have been employed in realizing statistical mechanical models in the past @xcite .",
    "such methods have also been used to construct the levin - wen models  @xcite using the turaev - viro invariants @xcite and chain - mail link invariants  @xcite .",
    "kitaev s toric code has also been related to turaev - viro codes  @xcite .",
    "the levin - wen model corresponds to a topological invariant called barrett - westbury invariant  @xcite and the toric code corresponds to a special case of the kuperberg invariant  @xcite .",
    "this has been especially noted in  @xcite .",
    "we showed this explicitly in  @xcite where we embedded the @xmath3 quantum double models based on an involutory hopf algebra , @xmath1 , in an enlarged parameter space ( defined later ) , that of the @xmath0 generalized lattice gauge theories based on these algebras @xmath1 . in the special case",
    "where the algebra @xmath1 is taken to be the group algebra @xmath2 of a group @xmath5 , the generalized gauge theory can reproduce the lattice gauge theories familiar to physicists @xcite .",
    "the toric code occurs when we choose @xmath6 @xcite .    _ the quantum double model _ - the quantum double model of a discrete group @xmath5 is defined on a bidimensional lattice over a compact manifold @xmath7 of genus @xmath8 .",
    "the degrees of freedom live on the links of the lattice and they are vectors @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represents a link of the lattice .",
    "the total hilbert space @xmath12 is then the tensor product of all @xmath13 ( for all @xmath11 ) , in other words @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the total number of links .",
    "a basis vector @xmath16 of @xmath12 is then of the form @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .",
    "the dynamics of such a model is governed by a hamiltonian @xmath19 made up of a sum of commuting operators , acting locally on the plaquettes , @xmath20 , and vertices , @xmath21 of the lattice and this is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the plaquette operator , @xmath24 the vertex operator and @xmath25 positive numbers .",
    "these operators are both projectors and also commute with each other for all vertex and plaquettes making energy levels discrete .",
    "consider @xmath26 a complete set of eigenvectors of @xmath19 with @xmath27 .",
    "if the system is put into a bath with temperature @xmath28 one can obtain thermodynamics properties of such a system by its partition function @xmath29 with @xmath30 , being @xmath31 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the matrix @xmath32 is called the transfer matrix . since",
    "@xmath33 is given by equation [ hdq ] , the partition function can also be written as @xmath34 in the special case where @xmath35 this partition function can be rewritten as @xmath36 where the sum runs over all the configurations and @xmath37 if the holonomy of the plaquette @xmath20 is flat and @xmath38 otherwise .",
    "the function @xmath39 is invariant under gauge transformation , and then @xmath40 is the partition function of a lattice gauge model . for",
    "@xmath41 it can also be shown that @xmath42 is a partition function of some lattice gauge model @xcite .",
    "_ partition functions of @xmath0 lattice gauge theories _ - we mentioned earlier that the quantum double hamiltonian is related to the partition function of a lattice gauge model , as once we know the hamiltonian the partition function is well defined .",
    "now we can ask the question , if a partition function @xmath43 is given , is it possible to obtain a hamiltonian @xmath33 such that the equation [ hez ] is satisfied ?",
    "the answer for this question is no , however if @xmath43 is restricted to be gauge invariant it can be done .",
    "the reason is that there is a way of building gauge invariant partition functions out of a @xmath0 topological invariant called the kuperberg invariant @xcite , which is based on involutory hopf algebras .",
    "moreover this construction allows us to obtain partition functions that are more general than the lattice gauge ones , but they are still gauge invariant .",
    "this partition function is parametrized by four non - physical parameters , namely @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in other words @xmath43 will be a function of the form @xmath46 .",
    "the choice of such parameters leads to specific models .",
    "it is important to note that these parameters are not free such as for example @xmath47 in ordinary gauge theories .",
    "these parameters are fixed once the model is fixed .",
    "in particular , as it can be seen in @xcite , if the parameters are taken to be is the basis for the group algebra @xmath48 . ]",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the counit of the algebra @xmath2 .",
    "the partition function obtained by such a choice coincides with that of a @xmath0 pure lattice gauge theory with @xmath52 .",
    "different choices of these parameters lead to different partition functions which may not be related with gauge theories at all , however if we restrict the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 to be elements of the centre of @xmath2 , whatever the partition function is , it will be gauge invariant @xcite",
    ". the action in this partition function may not be of physical interest but they will all be gauge invariant , and for that reason we will say that @xmath46 is the partition function of a _",
    "generalized gauge theory_. from now on we consider @xmath5 to be a discrete group , and the @xmath0 dimensional lattice a finite cubic lattice as a triangulation of a manifold of the form @xmath55 , where @xmath7 is a @xmath3 compact manifold of genus @xmath8 and @xmath56 is the one dimensional sphere .    _",
    "kuperberg s construction of transfer matrices _ - the way to build these generalized partition functions @xmath46 is by associating tensors , made up of the structure constants of the algebra , to the faces and links of the lattice leading to a very complicated tensor network that , fortunately , can be realized as the trace of a matrix @xmath57 by @xmath58 where , by analogy , we can think of it as being the exponential of a hamiltonian @xmath59 , i. e. @xmath60 where the @xmath47 constant can be suppressed without loss of generality .",
    "the matrix @xmath61 can be thought of as an operator acting on a @xmath3 lattice ( over the @xmath3 manifold @xmath7 ) , but for that we have to make distinction between the _ timelike _ and _ spacelike _ directions on the original @xmath0 lattice from the third direction which we call timelike .",
    "we still work in the euclidean metric . ] . this procedure is shown in detail in @xcite , where a hilbert space @xmath12 is associated with the @xmath3 lattice as @xmath62 , with @xmath63 being the local hilbert space associated with the link @xmath11 of the @xmath3 lattice and @xmath15",
    "is the total number of links of the @xmath3 lattice .",
    "the degrees of freedom are then elements of @xmath2 living on the links , which is equivalent to saying that the degrees of freedom are group elements , since there is a one - to - one correspondence between group elements and elements of the basis of @xmath2 .",
    "_ models from the transfer matrix _ - we then obtain the hamiltonian by taking the logarithm of @xmath57 .",
    "however the hilbert space @xmath12 is very huge , which makes @xmath57 a very huge matrix and difficult to take its logarithm .",
    "but as we have done before @xcite the matrix @xmath57 can be decomposed into a product of local operators acting on @xmath12 given by u(z_s , z_t,_s,_t ) = _ p b_p(z_s)_l t_l(_s)l_l(z_t)_v a_v(_t),where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath11 denotes plaquettes , vertices and links respectively with @xmath64 and @xmath65 operators acting on the degrees of freedom located on the links @xmath11 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 the plaquette and vertex operator which we previously encountered in the quantum double hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "these vertex and plaquette operators satisfy the quantum double algebra @xcite matrix which satisfies the quantum yang - baxter equation ( qbye ) .",
    "this can also be taken to be a way to generate solutions for the ( qbye ) which coincide with the irreducible representations of the braid group in two dimensions .",
    "in physical terms these are anyons which are also the irreducible representations of the quantum double algebra and hence the usefulness of the quantum double hamiltonians in obtaining anyons in the spectrum of the theory .",
    "the reader is referred to the book on hopf algebras where these ideas are discussed @xcite . ] .",
    "moreover the plaquette and vertex operators commute with each other for all choices of plaquettes and vertices .",
    "the link operators do not commute in general and thus switching on the parameters corresponding to them namely , @xmath66 will complicate the procedure of taking logarithms of the transfer matrix .",
    "therefore we can not obtain exactly solvable hamiltonians for an arbitrary choice of the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we can only do it for those of which the local operators commute with each other .",
    "one such hamiltonian is the quantum double hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ hdq ] where only the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath68 corresponding to the plaquette and vertex operators are used .",
    "_ other models using more parameters in the transfer matrix _ - some examples include quasi - topological phases which result from a condensation of the excitations  @xcite of the quantum double phase of kitaev .",
    "this leads to increased ground state degeneracy for the condensed phases .",
    "examples of these phases were studied in  @xcite .",
    "these phases including the quantum double phases of kitaev were obtained when we considered the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath68 in the transfer matrix . in  @xcite",
    "we showed that we could obtain the quantum double phases of kitaev by writing down models which included @xmath54 or @xmath67 .    _ identifying topologically ordered phases _ - the models that exhibit topological order in @xmath69d can be understood by their quasi - particle content called anyons .",
    "the data that determines the phase are the ground state degeneracy , their statistics and fusion parameters @xcite . if two models have different ground state degeneracies , or different fusion rules or statistics , they are not in the same topological phase .    in this paper",
    "we take this program further by considering more parameters in the transfer matrix which were not included in  @xcite .",
    "we consider three types of models here .",
    "two of them do not include @xmath54 and @xmath67 while the third includes them .",
    "the first two sets of models comprise of the disordered quantum double hamiltonians of kitaev and a new hamiltonian which leads to `` partial '' confinement of the excitations of the quantum double phase of kitaev .",
    "we use the term partial to emphasize the fact that the models are such that the excitations can be moved a few steps with an energy cost after which they become deconfined like in the usual quantum double models . according to the terms",
    "added we can confine the excitations for any number of steps that we wish to .",
    "we will also call these models @xmath70-step confined models in the text to follow . the models which include the other two parameters , @xmath54 and @xmath67 are the quantum double hamiltonians perturbed by magnetic fields .",
    "these can be thought of as local perturbations to the exactly solvable hamiltonians of kitaev .",
    "due to the usefulness of these models to realize fault tolerant quantum computation , it is necessary to study the stability of the topological order to local perturbations  @xcite .",
    "these models have already been considered in the literature and we write them down here just for the sake of completion and to drive home the point that they are well within the parameter space of the three dimensional lattice gauge theories .",
    "our focus is on exactly solvable hamiltonians like the original toric code hamiltonian and so phase transitions are out of the scope of this paper as we will then necessarily have to move through perturbed toric code hamiltonians which are outside the exactly solvable regime .",
    "the contents of the paper are organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives a brief review of the construction of the transfer matrix of the generalized lattice gauge theories .",
    "the section also includes an introduction to the mathematical preliminaries that go into the construction of the partition function and the transfer matrices .",
    "the algebra of operators , which include the quantum double relations between the vertex and plaquette operators , are written down .",
    "the models obtained from this transfer matrix are described in section 3 .",
    "an outlook is presented in section 4 .",
    "the partition function of lattice gauge theory is a well known example of a classical partition function built out of local weights associated to plaquettes of an oriented 3d lattice , where the gauge degrees of freedom are elements of a gauge group @xmath5 living on the edges of the lattice .",
    "a configuration is a choice of an element @xmath10 for each link of the lattice .",
    "for @xmath52 the gauge degrees of freedom are spin variables @xmath71 living on the links .",
    "the action of this model is defined by @xmath72 , where the sum runs over the plaquettes of the lattice and @xmath73 is the holonomy of a plaquette @xmath20 . the partition function which describes the model",
    "is given by @xmath74 in above equation @xmath75 is the local weight for the model . due to the invariance of the local action under cyclic permutation ,",
    "the local weight is also invariant under this cyclic permutation , which makes it a class function , @xmath76 ( equivalently , @xmath77 ) .",
    "this construction can be generalized by choosing @xmath78 as being any class function @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , we can associate local weights , @xmath79 , to the edges @xmath11 of the lattice , such that the partition function is now given by @xmath80 we can reproduce the usual lattice gauge theories by making appropriate choices for @xmath81 and @xmath79 and also generate partition functions that are still gauge invariant but do not represent a physical model .",
    "the partition function in equation ( [ pf ] ) is called the partition function of a generalized lattice gauge theory . starting from this partition function",
    "we can obtain a transfer matrix whose logarithm gives us hamiltonian operators , and thus dynamical quantum models defined over the hilbert space @xmath12 defined before .",
    "these quantum models are parametrized by functions of the parameters of the generalized lattice gauge theories . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the quantum double hamiltonians of kitaev , of which the toric code is a special case , can be obtained from this approach . in other words",
    "it was shown how to embed such models in the parameter space of these generalized lattice gauge theories .    in",
    "@xcite it was shown that this partition function can be build out of the structure constants of an involutory hopf algebra @xmath1 and a 3-manifold of the form @xmath55 , where @xmath7 is some compact 2-manifold and @xmath56 is the 1-dimensional sphere .",
    "we did not consider all possible deformations of the generalized lattice gauge theory partition function in  @xcite , working only with a specific kind of deformation ( one parameter deformation ) of the gauge theory partition function .",
    "now we will allow other deformations by letting the parameters be any element of the center of the algebra @xmath1 and it s dual algebra , @xmath82 .",
    "we only work with group algebras @xmath2 of a discrete group @xmath5 here .",
    "nevertheless the methods presented here hold for any involutory hopf algebra .",
    "we will go through the mathematical preliminaries beginning with the definition of the group algebra @xmath2 .",
    "the group algebra @xmath2 of a discrete finite group @xmath5 is generated by the basis elements @xmath83 indexed by the group elements and let @xmath84 be the dual basis such that @xmath85 . in this basis the multiplication and co - multiplication are defined by    @xmath86    and we can easily see that the unit and the co - unit of the algebra are @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the identity element of the group .    finally the antipode map is defined by @xmath89",
    "it is not difficult to see that the group algebra structure constants satisfy all the axioms of hopf algebras  @xcite .",
    "an important thing about the group algebra is the fact that it is an involutory hopf algebra , which means that @xmath90 .    as the simplest example lets consider the group algebra of @xmath91 .",
    "the group @xmath91 is defined by @xmath92 , and the product is the usual multiplication .",
    "the group algebra @xmath48 has @xmath93 as basis , and the product is given by @xmath94 the dual basis is @xmath95 , and the coproduct defined by @xmath96 the antipode in this case is trivial @xmath97 .",
    "consider an oriented @xmath0 cubic lattice as a triangulation of a closed @xmath0 manifold of the form @xmath55 and let @xmath5 be a discrete finite group .",
    "the degrees of freedom are elements of the gauge group @xmath5 located on the links of this lattice .",
    "a configuration is a choice of one group element for each link of the lattice .",
    "the generalized partition function is then built by associating tensors for each face and link of the lattice which will play the role of local weights .",
    "these tensors contract with each other resulting in a scalar called generalized partition function @xmath98 .    for a plaquette , whose boundary links carry the group elements @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , we associate a tensor @xmath103 defined by the algebra structure as shown in figure [ tensorlattice - a ] . for a link with four plaquettes glued to it s edges , labelled by @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , we associate a tensor @xmath108 defined by the coalgebra structure as shown in figure [ tensorlattice - c ] .",
    "it is very important to have an algebra and coalgebra structure so that the associated tensors can contract with each other on the closed manifold .",
    "these tensors are parametrized by the elements of the center of the group algebra @xmath2 and it s dual , @xmath106 and @xmath109 @xmath110 and @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the trace in the regular representation and @xmath113 .",
    "the partition function is obtained by contracting the indices of the tensors associated to the plaquettes and links .",
    "however we need to take care of the orientation of the lattice while performing this contraction .",
    "if the plaquette and link orientation matches the contraction is made directly , otherwise it is done through the antipode tensor @xmath114 . at the end the partition function will be of the form @xmath115 where the sum runs over all the contracted indices of all tensors and @xmath116 runs over the links with mismatching orientations .    as an example take @xmath52 and choose @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "then the tensors will be of the form @xmath119 note that @xmath120 is the holonomy @xmath73 of the plaquete @xmath20 . in this case , due to",
    "[ bluh ] , the sum over indices in the partition function in eq .",
    "[ kak ] will reduce to a sum of indices of the tensor @xmath103 ( for all plaquettes ) , in other words , it will become a sum over configurations and the partition function will take the form @xmath121 that is exactly the partition function of the lattice gauge theory defined in eq .",
    "[ kaka ] .",
    "we can now extract a transfer matrix @xmath122 out of this partition function , but first we have to make a distinction between timelike and spacelike directions of the 3d lattice , as shown in figure [ fixingorientation ] for a small piece of the lattice .",
    "since there is now a distinction between the timelike and spacelike parts there is nothing forcing the parameters of the timelike and spacelike plaquette weights to be the same .",
    "so for a more general description we have all spacelike plaquette weights parametrized by the element @xmath53 need not be the same for all the spacelike plaquettes .",
    "this shows that this construction need not obey translational invariance .",

    "the same fact holds for the other parameters as well .",
    "] while the timelike ones are parametrized by @xmath54 . in a similar manner the spacelike and timelike link weights are parametrized by @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively . therefore the partition function is now a function of the form @xmath46 . and the lattice @xmath123 , so it is actually a function of the form @xmath124 . for brevity",
    "we denote it just as @xmath46 . ]         from the partition function we have just defined we can get a transfer matrix @xmath125 such that its trace is equal to the partition function .",

    "we are now considering a more general parametrization than the one considered in @xcite .",
    "the way to get the transfer matrix is similar to the procedure shown in  @xcite , resulting in the same operators as in  @xcite but now in a bigger parameter space .",

    "we discussed a class of such models in @xcite where we exhibited exactly solvable models which continued to remain in the quantum double phase described by modified vertex operators or plaquette operators . here",
    "we show another class of models that can be obtained from the transfer matrices of lattice gauge theories that continue to remain exactly solvable but the excitations are `` partially '' confined with respect to those of the original quantum double model . by this",
    "we mean that the deconfined quantum double excitations are now confined up to a few steps due to the addition of an extra term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the number of steps for which they are confined can be controlled by adding the appropriate term in the hamiltonian .",
    "we will call these models @xmath70-step confined models .",

    "the transfer matrix is now significantly modified as new single qudit operators , acting on individual links , appear .",
    "they do not commute with the vertex and plaquette operators in general .",
    "however for certain special values of parameters they commute with products of vertex and plaquette operators as we shall see when we consider these models later in this section .",
    "the models obtained at these values are quantum double hamiltonians perturbed by generalized `` magnetic '' fields .",
    "they have the interpretation of magnetic fields in the case the input algebra @xmath1 is @xmath177 . for the remaining values of the parameters we obtain more complicated terms in the hamiltonian which we will briefly touch upon .",
    "these models are not exactly solvable and are outside the phase described by the quantum double hamiltonians , at least for sufficiently large values of the parameters .",
    "the transfer matrices used to obtain these models only use @xmath53 and @xmath68 .",
    "the other two parameters are set to @xmath178 and @xmath179 for all the timelike plaquettes and spacelike links . to obtain the disordered qdh models we associate a different central element of the algebra and it s dual to every spacelike plaquette and timelike link respectively .",
    "this leads to the following transfer matrix u ( , z_s , p , _ t , v ) = _ p b_p(z_s , p )  _ v a_v(_t , v ) where @xmath180 and @xmath181 are the parameters for the plaquette @xmath20 and vertex @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the plaquette and vertex operators commute with each other in this transfer matrix and each of the operators is a sum of projectors .",
    "thus it is easy to take the logarithm of these matrices to obtain the disordered qdhs .",
    "let us look at these hamiltonians in the case when @xmath182 .",
    "denote the basis elements of @xmath177 by @xmath183 with @xmath184 , and the basis elements of the dual @xmath185 by @xmath186 with the product @xmath187 .",
    "the central elements of @xmath177 and @xmath185 can be written as @xmath188 and @xmath189 respectively . by assigning each spacelike plaquette and timelike link with @xmath180 and @xmath181 respectively",
    "we obtain the transfer matrix as u((z_2 ) , z_s , p , _ t , v ) = _ p b_p(z _ s , p )  _ va_v(_t , v ) where the plaquette operators are given by b_p(z_s , p ) = _ 1,p b_p^1 + _ -1,p b_p^-1 with b_p^1 = and the vertex operators are given by a_v(_t , v ) = ( ) a_v^1 + ( ) a_v^-1 with a_v^1 = .",
    "the action is shown in figure ( [ linknum ] ) .",
    "the disordered qdh can now be written as [ dish]h = _ v ( ( ) a_v^1 + ( ) a_v^-1 ) + _ p ( _ 1,p b_p^1 + _",
    "-1,p b_p^-1).as it can be seen this hamiltonian breaks translational invariance and is made up of a sum of commuting projectors . when translational invariance is restored we recover the familiar toric code hamiltonian .    the ground state for this hamiltonian",
    "is easily obtained by projecting on to the smallest of @xmath190 and @xmath191 for every vertex @xmath21 and @xmath192 and @xmath193 for every plaquette @xmath20 .",
    "the ground state degeneracy is the same as the usual toric code and the winding operators , [ xw ] x_c_1^ * , c_2^ * , ( c_1^ * , c_2^ * ) = _ jc_1^ * , c_2^ * , ( c_1^ * , c_2^ * ) ^x_j [ zw]z_c_1 , c_2 , ( c_1 , c_2 ) = _ kc_1 , c_2 , ( c_1 , c_2)^z_k where the non - contractible loops @xmath194 are defined on the direct and dual lattice respectively as shown in the figure [ noncontract ] , commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "the excitations correspond to the other value of the coefficients for each vertex and plaquette .",
    "the string operators ( ribbon operators in the case of the non - abelian groups  @xcite ) creating the excitations are the same as in the qdh case . for the specific case of",
    "@xmath177 we have the string operators , creating charge or vertex excitations at the end points of the string @xmath195 along the direct lattice , as [ zs]v_= _ j ^z_j and those of the fluxes or plaquette excitations at the end points of the string @xmath196 along the dual lattice as [ xs ] p_^ * = _ k^ * ^x_k .",
    "these are shown in figure [ deconfstepflux ] . as is well known these excitations are deconfined by which we mean that there is no cost in energy for moving them around by stretching the string creating them .",
    "moreover the fusion rules and braiding statistics are the same as in the translationally invariant toric code .",
    "thus we conclude that the disordered qdh given in eq .",
    "( [ dish ] ) continues to remain in the toric code phase .",
    "we first consider the case with @xmath197 . to obtain this",
    "we write down an example of exactly solvable hamiltonian made up of the qdh vertex and plaquette operators along with new terms made of these operators which have 2-step confined low energy excitations unlike the qdh case where all the excitations are completely deconfined .",
    "the transfer matrix used to obtain these models contain only the @xmath53 and @xmath68 parameters .",
    "the transfer matrix can be written as u ( , z_s , _ t ) = _ pb_p(z_s )  _ va_v(_t ) . in the case of",
    "@xmath177 we can write down the hamiltonian with the 2-step confined charges and fluxes as follows h & = & _ v ( _ 1 a_v^1 + _",
    "-1a_v^-1 ) + _ p(_1 b_p^1 + _ -1 b_p^-1 ) + & + & _ < ij > ( _ 1 a_v_i^1a_v_j^1 + _ 2 a_v_i^1a_v_j^-1 + _ 3 a_v_i^-1a_v_j^1 + _",

    "the degeneracy does not change as the winding operators in the toric code case , given by eq.([xw ] ) and eq.([zw ] ) , continue to commute with this hamiltonian and thus help create the new states from a given ground state .",
    "in particular on a torus the degeneracy is four .",
    "the interesting feature of this model occurs when we look at the excitations . as in the toric code case",
    "the string operators creating charge and flux excitations are given by eq.([zs ] ) and eq.([xs ] ) respectively .",
    "however in this model when we create a charge or flux excitation we also excite the direct or the dual link given by the @xmath200 or the @xmath201 term respectively .",
    "this creates link excitations along the string where the operator given by eq.([zs ] ) or eq.([xs ] ) acts",
    ". however the creation of these link excitations occurs only for two steps after which they are deconfined as in the toric code case .",
    "thus we say that these excitations as 2-step confined excitations .",
    "these partially confined excitations are shown in figure ( [ confstep ] ) and ( [ confstepflux ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the dyonic excitations are also confined in a similar manner .",
    "thus we have a model based on lattice gauge theory which is exactly solvable , has ground state degeneracy and has excitations which are confined up to two steps or can be thought of as being partially confined .",
    "there is a natural way to increase the number of steps for which these particles are confined .",
    "this is achieved by coupling more number of vertex and plaquette operators .",
    "for example to obtain three - step confinement we add terms of the form @xmath202 where @xmath203 are nearest neighbors on the direct lattice .",
    "the corresponding plaquette terms are @xmath204 where @xmath205 are nearest neighbor vertices on the dual lattice .",
    "the energy of these excitations are more when compared to the original qdh as we violate more terms in the hamiltonian to obtain them .",
    "this argument can easily be extended to any number of steps .",
    "the corresponding figures of the @xmath70-step confined excitations will have a larger shaded region where they are confined when compared to the @xmath197 case .",
    "this model can be constructed on any triangulation of a two dimensional lattice keeping the confinement properties unchanged .",
    "this is easy to see as the additional terms of pairing neighboring vertex and plaquette operators is independent of triangulation .",
    "the model can also be easily extended to all group algebras and more generally to all involutory hopf algebras without any obstacle .    in the case of",
    "@xmath206 we can also add the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath67 , to include the single qudit terms in the transfer matrix and keep the above properties of confinement .",
    "we will illustrate why this is so for @xmath177 .",
    "the argument extends easily for other @xmath70 .",
    "we have the following relation a_v_1 ^ 1a_v_2 ^ 1 t_l a_v_1 ^ 1a_v_2 ^ 1 = a_v_1 ^ 1a_v_2 ^ 1 where @xmath207 and @xmath208 , @xmath209 are the end points of the link @xmath11 .",
    "this reduces the model to the previous hamiltonian showing confinement . from this identity",
    "we see that we can include the parameters @xmath67 in the transfer matrix without any effect to the properties of the hamiltonian considered earlier .",
    "also note that the braiding and fusion rules do not change in the @xmath197 case .",
    "the only difference from the usual toric code is that the energy of the quasiparticle excitations is now higher and there is an energy cost to move them up to one step in the lattice . since the topological data is the same we conclude that this model is in the same phase as the toric code .",
    "by increasing @xmath70 we could enter a different phase , namely a confined phase , in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these are constructed out of transfer matrices which include the parameters @xmath54 or @xmath67 .",
    "their inclusion introduces single qudit operators @xmath210 and @xmath211 on the link @xmath11 respectively .",
    "these terms do not commute in general with the vertex and plaquette operators thereby making the process of taking their logarithms and hence obtaining the hamiltonian difficult .",
    "however for certain parameters we can still take the logarithm to obtain a hamiltonian .",
    "we will illustrate this in the case of @xmath182 .",
    "let us include the parameter @xmath54 into the transfer matrix .",
    "this brings in the operator l_l(z_t ) = ( ) ( 1+^x_l ) + ( ) ( 1-^x_l ) when @xmath212 .",
    "when @xmath213 we can have a product of two plaquette operators adjacent to the link @xmath11 commute with @xmath210 .",
    "we can then take the logarithms to obtain the following hamiltonian h = _",
    "v(ln(_1 ) a_v^1 + ln(_-1 ) a_v^-1 ) + _ p(ln(_1 ) b_p^1 + ln(_-1 ) b_p^-1 ) + i ( ) .",
    "this model resembles adding magnetic perturbations to the qdh for the simplest case of @xmath177 .",
    "the dual version of this involves using the parameter @xmath67 in the transfer matrix to obtain the magnetic field operator @xmath214 on the links .",
    "a systematic procedure was used to obtain the models with interesting properties which included studying all possible ways of taking the logarithms of the transfer matrices of generalized lattice gauge theories . in  @xcite",
    "this led to quasi - topological phases with increased ground state degeneracy occurring due to condensed excitations of the qdh . in this paper another way of taking the logarithm led to partially confined excitations .",
    "we went further to include other parameters in the transfer matrix which took us away from the topologically ordered phases .    the state sum procedure used in  @xcite and further explored here",
    "can be thought of as a method to construct the quantum double of a given input algebra .",
    "using this principle we can use other inputs to obtain the quantum doubles of more general objects leading to more interesting models .",
    "one such input are groupoid algebras which are examples of quantum groupoids .",

    "the weak hopf algebras used in  @xcite were the ones constructed from a unitary fusion category by kitaev and kong in  @xcite .",
    "in particular by using weak hopf algebras of  @xcite as inputs in the construction of  @xcite we will be able to obtain the operators creating excitations in the levin - wen models and finally we can confine and condense these quasi particles by using the methods in this paper .",
