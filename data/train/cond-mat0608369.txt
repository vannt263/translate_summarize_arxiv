    "negative values of @xmath12 give rise to a first order phase transition whereas @xmath13 is associated with a tricritical point ( see @xcite for field theoretical as well as @xcite for recently performed numerical investigations of tricritical directed percolation ) .    as usual for second order phase transitions the system obeys certain scaling laws close to criticality ( see @xcite or @xcite for complete discussions of the critical scaling behavior of absorbing phase transitions ) . for example , the steady state order parameter scales ( up to higher orders ) as @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",

    "it is worth mentioning that equation([eq : p_sur_alpha_rho ] ) follows from the rapidity reversal symmetry of the dynamical functional  @xmath42 , i.e. , it is a specific property of the directed percolation universality class .",
    "thus , compared to general absorbing phase transitions , the number of independent critical exponents for directed percolation is reduced .",
    "furthermore , the self - duality is expressed within the field theoretical treatment of the minimal langevin equation of directed percolation .",
    "hence , the important rapidity reversal is usually reflected on a coarse grained level only and holds often only asymptotically . in other words",

    "i.e.  it does not necessarily represent a physical symmetry of microscopic models  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the robustness and the ubiquity of the dp universality class is expressed by the conjecture of janssen and grassberger  @xcite : short - range interacting systems , exhibiting a continuous phase transition into an absorbing state , belong to the dp universality class , if they are characterized by a one - component order parameter .",
    "different universal scaling behavior is expected to occur in the presence of additional symmetries or relevant disorder effects .",
    "several lattice models are known which exhibit an absorbing phase transition belonging to the directed percolation universality class .",

    "another well known @xmath43-dimensional stochastic cellular automaton exhibiting directed percolation scaling behavior is the domany - kinzel ( dk ) automaton  @xcite .",

    "this dependence results in a non - trivial phase diagram which is shown in figure[fig : dk_phase_dia_01 ] .",
    "some particular processes are included in the domany - kinzel automaton .",
    "for example , the process of bond directed percolation corresponds to the choice @xmath49 whereas site directed percolation is obtained for @xmath50  @xcite .",

    "occupied sites are marked by full circles .",

    "the state of the one - dimensional system at time @xmath52 is obtained by an iteration of the dynamics rules that are embodied in the conditional probabilities @xmath53 .",

    "the last statement is also valid for the @xmath43-dimensional domany - kinzel automaton although the transition line as well as the values of the critical exponents differ from the mean field approximations ( see figure[fig : dk_phase_dia_01 ] ) .",
    "clearly , the above derived mean field results are not valid for @xmath67 . in that case",
