    "the purpose of this paper is to give a closed form formula for the product of any two basis vectors of a cayley - dickson algebra .",
    "the complex numbers are constructed by a doubling product on the set of real numbers : @xmath0 to produce the quaternions by a doubling product on the complex numbers requires that one take conjugation into consideration in such a way that , for real numbers the product reduces to the one above .",
    "there are eight ( and only eight ) distinct cayley - dickson doubling products @xcite which accomplish this . for each of the eight",
    ", the conjugate of an ordered pair @xmath1 is defined recursively by @xmath2 the eight doubling products are : @xmath3 only two of these eight , @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been investigated .",
    "the eight algebras resulting from these products are isomorphic @xcite and all have the same elements and the same unit basis vectors @xmath6 .",
    "the basis vectors will be defined below .",
    "the eight products may be arranged in four transpose pairs @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath8,@xmath9 , @xmath10,@xmath11 , @xmath12,@xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "they are transposes in the sense that , given two basis vectors @xmath13 , @xmath14 , it is the case that @xmath15 .",
    "this holds for each of the four product pairs .",
    "so the multiplication table of the basis vectors for a product @xmath16 is the transpose of the multiplication table of its transpose @xmath17 . given a basis vector @xmath13 and a basis vector @xmath14 there is only one @xmath18 for which it is the case that either @xmath19 or @xmath20 , for any @xmath21 and @xmath22 the value of @xmath18 will be the same for all eight of the products and is denoted by @xmath23 ( which happens to also equal @xmath24 ) , but whether the product of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is @xmath25 or @xmath26 will depend upon which of the eight products is used .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the set of non - negative integers .",
    "for each of the eight products there is a corresponding _ twist _",
    "function @xcite @xmath28 such that for each @xmath29 , @xmath30    historically , researchers have been focused on the properties of the cayley - dickson algebras and not on the nature of the twist @xmath31 .",
    "one reason for this is that there seemed little rhyme or reason to @xmath31 .",
    "the fact that different researches numbered the basis vectors differently did not help the situation .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath4 and @xmath5 the function @xmath31 is particularly inscrutable .",
    "however , in @xcite a heuristic _ cayley - dickson tree",
    "_ method was described for computing @xmath32 for the product @xmath4 .    in @xcite",
    "the products @xmath7 , @xmath8,@xmath9 , @xmath10,@xmath11 , and @xmath12 were derived .",
    "further investigation has shown that for the product @xmath11 ( and its corresponding transpose ) there is a simple closed form formula for @xmath31 .",
    "that is the subject of this paper .",
    "each real number @xmath33 is identified with the infinite sequence @xmath34 and an ordered pair of two infinite sequences @xmath35 and @xmath36 is equated with the _ shuffled sequence _ @xmath37 only real number sequences terminating in a string of zeros are considered  that is , finite real sequences .    the basis for this space is chosen to be @xmath38 this basis differs from bases commonly used by other researchers . to distinguish this basis from others we call it the ` shuffle basis . '",
    "the shuffle basis vectors satisfy @xmath39 the conjugate of a sequence @xmath33 is @xmath40 thus    @xmath41    if @xmath42 are positive integers let @xmath23 denote the ` bit - wise exclusive or ' of the binary representations of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this is equivalent to the sum of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in @xmath43 .",
    "the non - negative integers are an abelian group with respect to the operation @xmath44 with identity 0 .",
    "the twist functions for each of the eight doubling products satify the following @xcite . @xmath45",
    "the following properties of @xmath31 are peculiar to the product @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath47    figure [ fig : omega ] on page shows @xmath48 for @xmath49 . the rows and columns of the matrix",
    "are numbered 0 through 127 with gray cells representing @xmath50 and white cells representing @xmath51 .     for @xmath49 ]",
    "in order to validate equations ( [ eq : npq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : npq2 ] ) we will traverse the @xmath31-tree @xcite in figure [ fig : omegatree ] on page associated with the doubling product @xmath11 .",
    "others have used such @xmath31 tree maps to research properties of cayley - dickson algebras @xcite .    in order to find @xmath48 for non - negative integers @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "it will be necessary to shuffle their bits . in order not to confuse this process with the shuffling @xmath53 of sequences @xmath33 and @xmath54 ,",
    "the shuffle of integers @xmath21 and @xmath22 will be denoted using square brackets .",
    "so , for example @xmath55=11,10,11 $ ] and @xmath56=[00011,11101]=01,01,01,10,11 $ ] .",
    "notice that the shuffled binary numbers have been rendered as a sequence of binary doublets .",
    "each doublet , beginning with the leftmost , is an instruction for traversing the @xmath46-tree beginning with the top @xmath57 node .",
    "a 0 is an instruction to move down a left branch and a 1 is an instruction to move down a right branch of the tree .    to find @xmath48 by this method ,",

    "terminating at @xmath59 or @xmath60 means that @xmath51 .",
    "terminating at any other node means that @xmath61 .",
    "an important property of @xmath46 is that once either @xmath62 or @xmath59 is reached it is unnecessary to continue traversing the tree and it will always be the case that @xmath61 or @xmath63 , respectively .    as an example of how one traverses the @xmath46-tree , let us find the basis vector product @xmath64 .",

    "next , it will be seen how to use the @xmath46-tree in figure [ fig : omegatree ] on page to validate equations ( [ eq : npq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : npq2 ] ) .    beginning with equation ( [ eq : npq1 ] ) .",

    "the doublets following the first will be either 00,01,10 , or 11 .",

    "subsequent doublets of either 00 or 11 remain at node @xmath60 . since @xmath73 there must occur a doublet 01 and it must occur prior to any potential doublet 10 . but 01 moves from node @xmath60 to node 1 . thus @xmath61 verifying equation ( [ eq : npq1 ] ) .",
    "for equation ( [ eq : npq2 ] ) suppose @xmath74 .",

    "lest the reader get eye strain from trying to verify the results for @xmath49 using figure [ fig : omega ] on page , the @xmath46 table for @xmath109 is provided in figure [ fig : omega5 ] on page . recall that gray cells denote @xmath61 and white cells denote @xmath63 .",

    "the problem historically with finding a simple closed form equation for the product of two cayley - dickson basis vectors has been caused by various approaches to the algebras .",
    "one issue is that only two of the eight cayley - dickson doubling products have been used @xcite each of which is the transpose of the other .",
    "@xmath116    unfortunately , the @xmath31 matrix of these two is sufficiently chaotic to dissuade further investigation .",
    "furthermore , a different way of numbering the basis vectors has traditionally been used which further scrambles the @xmath31 matrix .",
    "these issues have conspired to inhibit investigation into @xmath31 .",
    "now we see that if the doubling product @xmath117 is used and if the basis vectors are indexed over the group @xmath118 ( the ` shuffle ' basis ) a natural inverse fractal pattern emerges leading to the simple result in the theorem on page ."
