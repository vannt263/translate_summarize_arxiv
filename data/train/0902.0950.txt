    "when water resources are a limiting factor , continuous models show that plant interactions produce aggregation in patches that self - organize at larger scales to form more or less regular patterns @xcite , or disordered ones where patch areas obey scale - free probability distribution functions @xcite .",

    "seed dispersal at long distances has been identified as an important structuring factor of tree communities @xcite .",
    "fruit eating animals ( _ e.g. _ , spider monkeys @xcite ) swallow the seeds of many tree species and deposit them , through faeces , practically intact and away from the parent tree after a transit time of a few hours . between 60 and 90@xmath1 of the seeds of tree species of tropical forests",
    "are dispersed by vertebrates that feed on fruit @xcite , specially primates @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to study an automaton model of moving foragers that modify , via seed dispersal , the long term structure of the resources they consume . in turn",
    ", these resources also determine the foragers displacements , who use cognitive skills to explore their medium in an efficient , non - random way .",
    "the model assumes that two factors influence the growth success of a seed : the distance to the parent plant @xcite and competition due to the presence of other plants @xcite . despite",
    "that the model is over - simplified , the forager / resources coupled dynamics leads to rich behaviours , like self - organized states with power - law statistics for patch sizes and animal movement lengths .",
    "the following two sections describe the model and its background .",
    "the results and the underlying mechanism leading to power - laws in this system are presented in section [ res ] , and conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "we first describe the movement rules of the model forager in a stationary distribution of resource patches ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . consider a two - dimensional square domain of area unity containing @xmath2 fixed , point - like patches randomly and uniformly distributed .",
    "to each patch @xmath3 is assigned a fixed size ( or food content ) , @xmath4 , a integer drawn from a given distribution , @xmath5 .    like",

    "evidence shows that travels to fruiting trees are more frequent than as suggested by random null models @xcite .",
    "primates also keep record of the sites they have visited in a recent past @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that our model forager has a perfect knowledge of the positions and sizes of all the patches in the system . initially , a forager is located on a patch chosen at random .",
    "the following deterministic foraging rules are then iteratively applied at every time step ( @xmath6 ) :    the forager located at patch @xmath3 feeds on that patch , the fruit content decreasing by one unit : @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath8 has reached the value 0 , the forager chooses an other patch , @xmath9 , such that @xmath10 is maximal over all the allowed patches @xmath11 in the system , where @xmath12 is the food content of patch @xmath9 and @xmath13 the euclidean distance between patches @xmath3 and @xmath9 . with this rule , the next visited patch ( the best \" patch )",
    "has a large food content and/or is at a short distance from @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the travel from @xmath3 to @xmath9 takes one time unit .",
    "the forager does not revisit previously visited patches .",
    "this model produces complex trajectories that have been studied in details in refs .",
    "@xcite and discussed in connection with spider monkeys foraging patterns observed in the field @xcite .",
    "the model has a remarkable property , of interest in the following .",
    "let us define the forager mean - displacement @xmath14 as @xmath15 with @xmath16 the forager position at time @xmath17 , the averages being taken over different times @xmath18 and independent disorder realizations . at fixed patch number @xmath2 and time @xmath17 , if the resource size distribution is the inverse power - law @xmath19 with @xmath20 , then the mean displacement @xmath14 is maximal @xcite . in other words , media with this size distribution",
    "induce maximal displacements , see figure 1 .",
    "( this property still holds if the forager travels at constant velocity instead of moving in one time unit from one patch to the other @xcite . )",
    "the feature above can be understood qualitatively by noting that if the medium is very homogeneous ( say , @xmath21 ) , then all patches are similar in size : given rule _",
    "( ii ) _ , the forager chooses essentially nearby patches .",
    "trajectories are thus composed of small steps and diffusion is relatively slow @xcite . on the contrary , if the medium is very heterogeneous ( @xmath22 ) , patches with @xmath23 are numerous : the forager often performs a large step to reach a very good patch and stays there a long time feeding , given rule @xmath24 .",
    "the forager activity is dominated by these long trapping times , resulting in very slow ( nearly frozen ) diffusion .",
    "an intermediate situation corresponds to @xmath20 , for which the best patch from a given point is often far away ( at distances much larger than the typical distance between nearest - neighbour patches ) , but these good patches still have reasonable sizes , so that the forager does not remain trapped feeding on them during very long periods of time .    ) as a function of time for the model forager in a random medium with resources size distributed as @xmath25 ( @xmath26).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    let us note that , at the special resource exponent value @xmath20 , the trajectory of the forager closely resembles a lvy flight .",
    "numerical simulations show that the distribution function of the distances separating successively visited patches is asymptotically given by the power - law @xcite @xmath27 the foraging patterns of spider monkeys are well described by the distribution ( [ scalelength ] ) @xcite .",
    "even more , these animals feed on trees whose size distribution obeys @xmath28 with @xmath29 , a value close to 3 @xcite .",
    "in the previous model , forager motion is induced by the medium . in the generalization considered from now on",
    ", the forager follows the same rules but also modifies its environment through seed dispersal .",
    "hence , the distribution of resource sizes , @xmath5 , is no longer held fixed and can slowly change over time .",
    "we assume that foragers are the main mechanism of seed dispersal .    at @xmath30 ,",
    "@xmath2 point - like patches , all with size @xmath31 , are randomly and uniformly distributed in the square domain of unit area .",
    "a forager initially located on a patch chosen at random follows the rules _ ( i)_-_(iii ) _ above .",
    "in addition ,    every @xmath32 time units ( the digestion time ) , a seed is deposited at the patch where the forager is located ;    every @xmath33 time units , the walk ends and the forager is removed ; the patches are refreshed to their initial @xmath8 values ; the patches that have received a seed that has survived ( see below ) increase their size by one unit , @xmath34 ;    a new forager ( _ i.e. _ not representing necessarily the same individual , but still having a perfect knowledge of the updated environment ) is located on a patch chosen at random and the process is iterated as above for another @xmath35 time units ;    a plant that has grown from a seed deposited @xmath36 time units earlier ( @xmath37 ) dies and the patch size decreases , @xmath7 ;    in rule _ ( vii ) _ , the size of a patch does not decrease below the minimal value @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that two factors determine the survival probability of a deposited seed ( or the growth success of a plant here ) in stage _",
    "( v)_. the first assumption is based on observations that seeds dispersed far away survive better , as they are less likely to attract seed predators and to be transmitted parasites or diseases from the parent plant @xcite .",
    "the second assumption takes into account competition among plants for limited nutrients @xcite .",
    "let us note @xmath38 the size of the patch where the seed is deposited and @xmath39 its distance to the parent patch , which is the patch where the forager was located @xmath40 time units ago .",
    "the survival probability of the seed , @xmath41 , is set to @xmath42 with @xmath43^n,\\label{pd}\\\\   p_c(k)&=&\\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } 1-\\frac{k}{k_{max}+1}\\ & { \\rm if}\\ k\\le k_{max}\\\\ 0\\ & { \\rm if}\\ k > k_{max } , \\end{array } \\right.\\label{pc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 the typical distance between nearest - neighbour patches and @xmath45 a fixed integer accounting for competition effects .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 is proportional , say , to the nutrients concentration . according to ( [ pd ] ) , the survival probability increases from 0 to 1 as the distance from the parent patch increases , whereas it decreases from 1 to 0 as the size of the colonized patch increases from 1 to @xmath45 , the maximum patch size . in the following , we fix @xmath46 in eq.([pd ] )",
    ", the results presented below being not qualitatively modified if larger values of @xmath47 are chosen .",
    "it is natural to ask the following question . given that in the model the survival probability increases with the distance to the parent plant and that the largest forager displacements are produced in media with the size distribution @xmath48 , do resources self - organize towards this particular scaling - law ( and foraging patterns towards the lvy law ( [ scalelength ] ) ) ?",
    "as a consequence of the memory - based foraging rules _ ( i)-(iii ) _ , such environments should have the highest average biomass production rate .",
    "as the foragers start dispersing seeds , small heterogeneities are produced ( @xmath49 ) , and , from a dynamical system point of view , the fastest growing modes may dominate the dynamics asymptotically .    ) of the biomass , for two values of the competition parameter @xmath45 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    successful seeds contribute to the emergence of larger , more attractive patches that are also susceptible of being visited more often in the future .",
    "this positive feedback loop contributes to the increase of heterogeneities , within some limits . if very big patches are produced , due to rule _ (",
    "i ) _ many seeds will be dispersed at the distance @xmath54 and will die , given the kernel ( [ pd ] ) .",
    "the other stabilizing effects are competition and mortality .      to investigate the possibility of the scenario sketched above , let us first consider the behaviour of the system biomass , @xmath55 , as a function of time .",
    "as displayed in figure [ figbiomass ] , @xmath56 initially increases and reaches a maximum value .",
    "it then suffers a abrupt drop , followed by a noisy stationary regime .",
    "the asymptotic average biomass depends strongly on plant competition : unexpectedly , it is lower at low competition levels ( large @xmath45 ) .",
    "the system actually builds spatial heterogeneities during the initial growth regime .",
    "biomass is maximum at @xmath57 , here ) , when the first plants grown from dispersed seeds start to die . as shown by figure [ figpk1 ] , the size distribution @xmath5 at @xmath58",
    "is perfectly fitted by the power - law @xmath59 for @xmath60 , independently of the value of @xmath45 . at the same time , and as expected from eq.([scalelength ] ) , the forager step length distribution ( figure [ figpl ] ) tends to the scaling - law @xmath61 in a range of intermediate values of @xmath39 , with a truncation at large @xmath39 due to finite @xmath45 , @xmath36 and @xmath2 . note the existence of steps of order of the system size ( @xmath62 , here ) . in some sense ,",
    "the system self - organizes into a critical state of maximal dispersion .",
    ", when biomass is maximal , for @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the straight line has a slope @xmath65.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    interestingly , this scaling behaviour does not persist at larger times @xmath66 . simultaneously to the biomass collapse ( fig.[figbiomass ] ) , corrections to scaling appear .",
    "asymptotically , the shape of the patch distribution decreases rapidly with patch size and exhibits a practically constant fat tail , see figure [ figpk1 ] . hence , most patches have a small characteristic size and coexist with a few outliers \" of size of order @xmath45 .",
    "this separation into two characteristic sizes becomes more pronounced at large @xmath45 .",
    "unexpectedly , dispersal by animals does not manage to stabilize the critical state for which it is responsible .",
    "despite that the system rapidly self - organizes into a state with optimal seed survival , it becomes overpopulated : mortality is much higher than birth shortly after @xmath36 and the size of many intermediate patches start to shrink .",
    "this feature is probably due to the fact that , at @xmath67 , the system is much more crowded with plants than at @xmath30 .",
    "the birth rate is therefore lower than in the initial growth regime because of higher competition ( eq.([pc ] ) ) : older dying plants are not replaced by the same quantity of new ones .",
    "in addition , due to their cognitive maps and the rules _ ( i)-(iii ) _ , foragers neglect many small , unattractive patches , among them the shrinking ones , that would be suitable for plant growth . instead , they keep revisiting a small number of nearly saturated large patches ( outliers ) .",
    "asymptotically , foragers therefore concentrate their activity on a fraction of the available land , resulting in a reduced biomass .",
    "figure [ figbiomassprom ] ( left ) displays the average biomass in the stationary regime as a function of the maximum allowed patch size , @xmath45 ( or nutrients concentration ) .",
    "counter - intuitively , but in agreement with the comments above , the general tendency is a biomass decrease with increasing @xmath45 .",
    "the biomass is large at small @xmath45 ( relatively low nutrients / high competition regime ) and presents an extrema at @xmath68 . at this parameter value , patches are relatively homogeneous in size : via foragers visits , seeds can colonize many different patches . at higher @xmath45",
    ", foragers start to visit large patches preferentially , neglecting smaller ones .",
    "supporting this interpretation , the power - spectra of the biomass time series @xmath69 reveal an increase in complexity with increasing @xmath45 , see figure [ figbiomassprom ] ( right ) . at high competition levels ( @xmath70 ) , the fluctuations of @xmath69 around its mean value are due to births and deaths that occur in a roughly independent way , due to a homogeneous dispersion of seeds .",
    "the spectrum is that of a white noise . at low competition ( @xmath71 ) ,",
    "the power spectrum is well approximated by a power - law @xmath0 with @xmath72 over more than one decade , indicating long - range temporal correlations .",
    "the spatially heterogeneous colonization of plants generates periods of high mortality ( avalanches \" ) of widely varying durations , followed by periods of easier recolonization .",
    "this dynamics is obviously reminiscent of the punctuated relaxation of sand - pile models in self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "an other unexpected phenomena is observed at low competition levels , in the interval @xmath73 for the parameter values considered here . in this interval , the average biomass increases again and exhibits a second maximum at @xmath74 .",
    "a closer look reveals that the system actually converges towards two distinct states , depending on the initial condition . at identical parameters values",
    ", the system sometimes ends up in a low , base `` biomass level that follows the tendency described above , and sometimes exhibits a significantly higher biomass ( excited '' state ) .",
    "biomass fluctuations are relatively small among different systems belonging to a same class ( base or excited ) , which makes possible the computation of the mean values separately ( see figure [ figbiomassprom ] ) . the origin of this bistability is unclear , although it is a known phenomenon in other models of vegetation pattern formation @xcite .",
    "we have proposed a new mechanism leading to the emergence of many spatio - temporal scales in the movement patterns of foraging animals . in the model proposed , foragers use mental maps to choose feeding patches and disperse seeds along their trajectories , thus affecting the long term distribution of their food resources .",
    "this simplified model focuses on plant - forager interactions , neglecting other important factors ( wind , gravity ... ) of seed dispersal @xcite .",
    "it is built on a generalization of a previous model , where scale - free displacement patterns of knowledgeable animals emerge from their interaction with resources that are distributed according to an _ a priori _ given power - law function @xcite . in the field , the distributions of the movements of spider monkeys and of the size of their fruiting trees are in good agreement with those given by that model for a particular parameter value , where animal displacements are maxima @xcite .",
    "the present approach shows that a memory - based ranging behaviour generates highly heterogeneous seed deposition patterns , a conclusion also reached in ref .",
    "@xcite with the use of a spatially explicit model parameterized with field - collected spider monkeys movement data .",
    "these findings suggest that , over large temporal scales , tree distributions may form complex spatial structures due to the presence of foraging animals .",
    "the present model proposes a theoretical test of this hypothesis : the distribution of resources is not held fixed and spatial heterogeneities self - organize spontaneously under the influence of positive feedback loops in the system dynamics .",
    "other existing theories of lvy @xcite or intermittent @xcite foraging assume that animals are memoryless and do not have any information on the location of resource patches . in these contexts , they execute a given markovian stochastic processes to find preys ( usually randomly distributed in space ) that are detectable only at short distance .",
    "movements with nontrivial distributions or rules are optimal for finding preys most efficiently in some cases . whereas this approach can be justified for marine animals foraging in unpredictable environments @xcite",
    ", frugivorous vertebrates rely on fixed resources and memory plays an essential role @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the introduction of limited knowledge and the use of search modes would improve the realism of the modelling approach presented here .    despite that , at each step , our model foragers maximize an efficiency function , their foraging activity can not be considered as optimal in the long term . the hypothesized relationship between long distance dispersal and species diversity in plant communities",
    "@xcite is probably not a simple one @xcite .",
    "the model exhibits sudden plant mortality avalanches that are consequences of a restricted land use and a lack of colonization of regions with low plant density .",
    "counter - intuitively , biomass levels are lower when the conditions for colonization are favourable , _",
    "i.e. _ at low plant competition levels .",
    "the same mechanism leading to the emergence of the self - organized critical state with optimal seed dispersal is also responsible for its rapid collapse .",
    "this ecological crash `` is the product of an intelligent foraging behaviour based on the satisfaction of immediate needs ( feeding ) . here , foragers do not change their strategy when plant resources start to shrink .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether the introduction of noise ( or irrationality '' ) in the deterministic decision rules improves this situation .",
    "the model developed here is similar in some aspects to sand - pile models of self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "the system is driven by successful dispersed seeds and biomass dissipated by mortality .",
    "soc - like models have been proposed to explain large extinctions in the fossil record @xcite and tree dynamics on ecological time - scales in rain forests @xcite . in the latter example",
    ", @xmath75-noise signals have been identified in simulated biomass time series @xcite ( unfortunately , biomass in real forests is very difficult to measure ) .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained here with other assumptions .",
    "the stationary regime of our model , however , is not strictly speaking asymptotically critical since the shape of the patch size distribution contains two characteristic sizes : a small one , of order 1 , and a much larger one , corresponding to the presence of outliers \" .",
    "such distributions seem to be ubiquitous in driven self - organized systems , though : they appear in earthquake models @xcite and also in other models of plant dynamics in the presence of limited nutrients @xcite .    the robustness of the features described above should be tested by modifying the foraging rules and the dispersion kernels .",
    "a more realistic , resource - dependent forager demography is an aspect that should also be considered .",
