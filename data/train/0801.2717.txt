    "one of the most interesting problems in nuclear physics is the isovector dependence on nuclear force , which can be found in nuclear symmetry energy , the isovector optical potential and neutron - proton effective mass splitting .",
    "the isovector feature of nuclear forces is crucial in order to gain a good understanding of neutron stars and exotic nuclear collisions produced at radioactive beam facilities and to describe the structure of exotic nuclei .",
    "this interest in the isospin dependence of nuclear forces is of recent date because data for neutron - rich nuclei were rather scarce in the past .",
    "the forthcoming new generation of radioactive beam facilities , such as the future gsi facility fair , the rare isotope accelerator planned in the usa and the spiral2 at ganil , will produce huge amounts of new data for neutron - rich nuclei . up to now",
    ", the isovector dependence of nuclear force has been investigated in heavy ion collisions experiments .",
    "the advantage of such kinds of reactions is that they allow testing of nuclear forces at supranormal densities since in intermediate energy compressions of two to three times nuclear saturation density is reached .",
    "nevertheless , the asymmetry of the colliding systems is moderate and therefore the isospin effects on the corresponding observables are moderate as well .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the predictions for the isospin dependence of nuclear interaction are very different . in general ,",
    "both microscopic and effective interactions have been extensively used in order to gain knowledge about the nuclear matter properties in conditions far from equilibrium ( hot nuclear matter , high density behavior and so on ) .",
    "it is appropriate therefore , in every case to incorporate temperature and momentum dependence in order to have a richer interaction and as a consequence be able to produce a more thorough description of nuclear matter properties .. specifically , the determination of the nuclear symmetry energy ( nse ) based on microscopic and/or phenomenological approaches is of great interest to nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics .",
    "for instance , it is important for the study of the structure and reactions of neutron - rich nuclei , the type ii supernova explosions , neutron - star mergers and the stability of neutron stars .",
    "so far , the main part of the calculations concerning the density dependence of the se is related to cold nuclear matter ( @xmath0 ) . however , recently there has been an increasing interest in the study of the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , including nse , and the properties of neutron stars at finite temperature @xcite    in our previous work @xcite we studied the effects of finite temperature on nse and we also found the appropriate relations describing that effect .",
    "we especially focused on the interaction part of the nse , which so far has received little theoretical attention concerning its dependence on temperature .",
    "we applied a momentum dependent effective interaction model .",
    "this model , afterwards called bgbd ( bombaci , gale , bertsch , das gupta),has been introduced by gale et al .",
    "@xcite to examine the influence of momentum - dependent interactions on the collective flow of heavy ion collisions . over the years",
    "the model has been extensively applied to study not only the heavy ion collisions , but also the properties of nuclear matter by proper modification @xcite .",
    "a review analysis of the present model is presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we have studied the momentum and temperature dependence of the mean field properties of asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "efforts up to now have been devoted mostly to studying the properties of cold nuclear matter .",
    "in contrast , the motivation for the present work is to study the properties of hot asymmetric nuclear matter , especially the temperature dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and the single particle properties of nuclear matter .",
    "we have employed a model with the characteristic property that the interacting part of the energy density is momentum dependent .",
    "thus , the single particle potentials of protons , neutrons , as well as the symmetry potential , are also momentum dependent .",
    "the isovector part of the optical potential , i.e. the symmetry potential , describes the difference between the neutron and proton single particle potentials in neutron rich matter .",
    "the symmetry potential is one of the basic inputs to the transport models for the collisions of radioactive nuclei @xcite .",
    "in addition , due to the momentum dependence , the temperature is expected to affect not only the kinetic part , but also the interacting part of the energy density .",
    "this is important in the sense that the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , influenced by temperature , has a powerful effect on the values of the proton fraction and consequently the composition of hot @xmath1-stable nuclear matter , with extensive applications in heavy - ion collisions and nuclear astrophysics .",
    "the effective mass ( em ) is one of the most fundamental properties characterizing the propagation of a nucleon in a nuclear medium .",
    "knowledge about nucleon em in neutron rich matter is crucial to fully understand several properties of neutron stars .",
    "em is determined by the derivative of the single particle potential with respect to the momenta @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the trend of the em is directly connected to the momentum dependence of the corresponding single particle potential .",
    "furthermore , the isospin splitting of the effective mass i.e. the difference between the neutron and proton effective masses is derived from the above model .",
    "the present study is a contribution to the theoretical study of the neutron - proton effective mass splitting , a problem which is still highly controversial within different approaches and/or using different nuclear effective interactions @xcite .",
    "the above analysis indicates the necessity to apply a momentum dependent interacting model to study the single particle properties of hot nuclear matter .    this work is a continuation of recent papers @xcite , where the authors have employed a phenomenological non - relativistic effective interaction first introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , with suitable modification concerning the isovector part of the interaction . here",

    "it seems that by applying the functions @xmath127 and @xmath128 we receive similar results only for low values of @xmath124 ( except for @xmath129 mev where a similar trend is taken also for higher values of @xmath124 ) .",
    "the case with @xmath130 , which introduces a much stiffer density dependence @xmath131 , leads to different results even for low values of momenta . to sum up , the density dependence of @xmath131 is well reflected on the momentum dependence of @xmath121 ,",
    "so it is expected that models with different density dependence in the nuclear symmetry energy may predict different energy dependence of @xmath121 .    in fig .",
    "7 we also plot @xmath121 as a function of @xmath124 , for the case @xmath108 .",
    "in fact , the trends for @xmath129 mev and @xmath117 mev coincide , and @xmath121 exhibits a negative slope , while for @xmath116 mev the slope of @xmath121 is positive .    the key quantity to explain the trend of @xmath121 as a function of @xmath124 is expression ( [ usym - mdp ] ) . for this expression",
    "we conclude that the behavior of @xmath92 as a function of @xmath2 is defined from the values of the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 as well as from the function @xmath35 .",
    "both the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 are related to the strength of the momentum dependence .",
    "in addition , @xmath93 is fixed also to reproduce the properties of symmetric nuclear matter at the saturation point , while @xmath94 is set to fix the density dependence of the symmetry energy . the regulator function @xmath35",
    "mainly affects the trend of the slope of @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , in case @xmath108 , after some algebra , the expression ( [ usym - mdp ] ) can be written as @xmath132 where @xmath133 is a constant .",
    "( [ usym - mdp-1 ] ) establishes a linear relation between @xmath121 and @xmath124 , in case @xmath108 , as indicated in fig .",
    "9 .    in case @xmath104 for low values of @xmath2 , a similar relation as ( [ usym - mdp-1 ] ) holds",
    "accordingly , for high values of @xmath2 we find @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a constant .    from the above analysis",
    "it is clear that the behavior of @xmath121 depends on the specific values of the parameters @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath100 and also on combinations of them .",
    "in particular , the values of the parameters define the sign of the slope ( positive or negative ) and the regulator function @xmath35 defines the trend of the slope .",
    "thus , the role of the regulator function @xmath35 is of importance , concerning the momentum - dependent behavior of the proton and neutron single particle potential , as well as the symmetry potential .    in view of the above comment it may be interesting to explore other choices for the regulator function as those used in ref . @xcite .",
    "such work is in progress .",
    "it is worth noting that according to fig .  7 ,",
    "@xmath121 is strongly related to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and the total parametrization of the interaction energy density part , i.e. for various values of the incompressibility @xmath110 .",
    "the three cases where @xmath121 is a decreasing function of nucleon momentum are shown in fig .  8 and compared with the phenomenological expression ( [ usym - lane ] ) .    in fig .",
    "9 we plot @xmath121 as a function of @xmath124 for the nuclear symmetry energy parametrization @xmath136 and @xmath118 and for three different values of @xmath103 . in both cases , @xmath121 ,",
    "exhibits strong density dependent behavior .",
    "in particular , there is a monotonic increase of @xmath121 as function of the nucleon density .",
    "special effort has been devoted to the study of the thermal effects on @xmath121 .",
    "so far , that problem has received little theoretical attention @xcite .",
    "temperature influences the first term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ usym-2 ] ) i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "the thermal effects on @xmath121 are displayed in fig .",
    "10 . in the first case ( fig .",
    "10[a ] ) an increase of @xmath45 leads to decreasing values of @xmath121 , while the inverse behavior is seen in the second case ( fig.10[b ] ) .",
    "however , in both cases thermal effects do play a role , especially for @xmath122 .",
    "temperature does not change the trend , but only slightly affects the values of @xmath121 depending on @xmath124 .",
    "another quantity of interest , which can be easily calculated , is the isoscalar potential .",
    "several decades ago , it was already pointed out that the quantity @xmath137 , which is obviously the single - nucleon potential in absence of asymmetry , should be a reasonable approximation to the isoscalar part of the optical potential .",
    "the momentum dependence of @xmath137 is important for extracting information about the symmetric matter equation of state @xcite .",
    "now , in order to check the validity of the model parameters this is customary , and a more stringent test to compare the isoscalar potentials , as calculated in the present work , with them of the variational many - body ( vmb ) predictions by wiringa @xcite .    in fig .",
    "11 we plot the isoscalar potential at the four values of momenta @xmath2 ( @xmath138 @xmath43 ) for four different cases .",
    "the results of the present work compared with those ( named uv14+uvii ) predicted by wiringa  @xcite . in fig .",
    "11(a ) indicated that for the specific case , the predictions of the present work are in very good agreement with the vmb predictions up to about @xmath139 @xmath43 . in a second case , presented in fig .",
    "11(b ) , there is agreement only for low values of the density and for momenta @xmath2 .",
    "there is obvious disagreement for the predictions presented in figs .",
    "11(c ) and  11(d ) . from the above analysis",
    "it is concluded that by suitable choice of the model parameters , we are able to reproduce and/or be consistent with the predictions of other microscopic many - body calculations or experimental constraints .",
    "this is an advantage of the present model that is flexible enough to reproduce predictions of many other theoretical models .",
    "the landau effective mass splitting is shown in fig .",
    "12 , where the effective masses of proton and neutron are displayed as functions of the asymmetry parameter @xmath79 for all cases corresponding to @xmath104 . for all cases",
    ", @xmath140 is a decreasing function of @xmath79 , while @xmath141 is an increasing function of @xmath79 .",
    "the only exception is the case for @xmath117 mev with @xmath126 , where @xmath141 is a decreasing function of @xmath79 . in every case",
    "the isospin mass splitting ( @xmath142 ) is positive and is directly dependent on the incompressibility @xmath110 and the parametrization function @xmath64 .    in the present work",
    ", we also address the problem which arises when the effective mass splitting directly affects the energy dependence of the symmetry potential @xcite .",
    "we found that in the framework of the proposed model and for the regulator function @xmath104 , all the cases lead to a positive splitting but the slope of the @xmath121 may be positive or negative .",
    "so , it is concluded that the trend of @xmath121 , by applying the present parametrization , does not directly connect to the effective mass splitting .",
    "nonetheless , we found that there is a correlation between @xmath121 and @xmath142 originated from the density dependence of @xmath131 .",
    "more precisely , the cases with @xmath127 and @xmath128 which lead to much closer values for @xmath121 also lead to a similar value of @xmath142 as is displayed in figs .  12 and  13 .    to illustrate further the dependence of the effective mass on the asymmetry parameter @xmath79 and to find the quantitative characteristic of this dependence ,",
    "the values of @xmath143 for various values of @xmath79 have been derived with the least - squares fit method and found to take the general form @xmath144    the parameters @xmath145 depend on the model parameters @xmath146 and they are different for each case .",
    "specifically , for low values of @xmath79 it is obvious that linear relations between @xmath143 and @xmath79 is hold ( see also fig .",
    "the splitting of effective masses , according to eq .",
    "( [ m - i - fit ] ) , is well approximated by @xmath147 where the parameters @xmath148 also depend on the model parameters @xmath146 .",
    "for low values of @xmath79 , the linear relation @xmath149 is hold .    the effective mass as a function of @xmath103 is indicated in fig .  13",
    ". in all cases",
    "the effective mass splitting ( @xmath150 ) is positive .    in fig .",
    "14(a ) the effective mass , for the case @xmath108 , is displayed .",
    "the splitting ( @xmath150 ) is positive for the case with @xmath129 mev ( and also for @xmath117 mev ) and negative for @xmath116 mev .",
    "thus , one can conclude by also comparing with the case @xmath104 , that the regulator function @xmath35 can have a dramatic effect on the effective mass splitting .",
    "the above feature is displayed also in fig .",
    "14(b ) , where the effective mass is plotted as a function of @xmath103 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in case @xmath108 , an almost linear relation between @xmath143 and @xmath79 is hold even for high values of @xmath79 ( in comparison with the case @xmath104 ) .",
    "so , the relation ( [ m - i - fit ] ) with @xmath151 , clearly describes the above dependence .",
    "it should be emphasized that according to figs .",
    "12 and  13 , the density dependence of the symmetry energy influences the values and also the slope of the effective mass ( both for proton and neutron ) , but does not affect the sign of the mass splitting , which always remains positive ( case @xmath152 .",
    "nevertheless , in case @xmath108 , for different values of @xmath110 the sign of the mass splitting may be negative or positive . in the case with @xmath116 the positive slope of @xmath121 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) is connected with the negative splitting ( see fig.14(a ) ) .",
    "this result is in accordance with the finding of ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the above analysis",
    "one can conclude that , in general , and by applying the proposed , in the present momentum effective interaction model , the slope ( positive or negative ) of the @xmath121 as a function of @xmath124 is not connected directly with the sign of the effective mass splitting .",
    "certainly , there is a connection between the above quantities in the sense that both , according to eqs .",
    "( [ mef - g1 ] ) , ( [ mef - g2 ] ) and ( [ usym - mdp ] ) , depend in a similar way on the parameters @xmath93 , @xmath94 @xmath100 .",
    "in this study we have applied a momentum dependent effective interaction in order to investigate the single - particle properties of hot asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "more specifically , we have examined the single - particle potentials of protons and neutrons , the asymmetry potential and the isospin mass splitting for various cases .",
    "the effects of the specific parametrization of the interaction part of the energy on the single - particle properties are studied and analyzed .",
    "it has been concluded that the behavior of the symmetry potential depends strongly on the parametrization of the interaction part of the energy density as well as on the momentum dependence of the regulator function .",
    "the effects of the parametrization are less pronounced on the isospin mass splitting .",
    "the effect of an increase of the temperature is just to shift higher the values of the proton and neutron single particle potential .",
    "the symmetry potential @xmath121 can be an increasing or decreasing function of the nucleon kinetic energy , depending on the parametrization of the momentum dependent effective interaction model . in the first case @xmath121 increases with the temperature , while in the second one",
    "the inverse behavior is observed .",
