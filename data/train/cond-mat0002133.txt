    "in view of understanding a particular phenomenon in condensed matter , theory is supposed to identify the corresponding relevant degrees of freedom and to provide the effective interaction between them by , approximately , integrating out the remaining ones so that one is left with a manageable model .",
    "it is a major challenge to determine the effective interactions because that requires to calculate the partition function of the whole system under the constraint of a fixed configuration of the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the benefit for carrying out this constrained calculation , which in general is more difficult than the original full problem , is twofold .",
    "first , there is a gain in transparency by describing the system in terms of relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "secondly , it is typically less risky to apply approximations for the partial trace because they only concern the less relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the determination of the phase behavior and of the structural properties of multi - component fluids represents a case study for this general approach .",
    "if the composing particles of the mixture are of comparable size and shape their degrees of freedom have to be treated on equal footing .",
    "the well developed machinery of liquid state theory  @xcite offers various techniques to cope with this problem .",
    "however , these techniques fail to yield reliable results if , e.g. , one component is much larger than the others ; in this case numerical simulations become inefficient and integral theories lose their accuracy .",
    "colloidal suspensions are a paradigmatic case for such highly asymmetric solutions . for their description",
    "these difficulties can be overcome by resorting to the general scheme laid out at the beginning with the positions of the colloidal particles as the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "accordingly the degrees of freedom of the small solvent particles are to be integrated out for a fixed configuration of the colloidal particles which we assume to be smooth , monodisperse spheres . at sufficiently low concentrations of the suspended particles",
    "this leads to an effective pair potential between them . in many cases",
    "the effective potential resembles the bare one , i.e. , the one in the absence of the solvent , but with modified , effective interaction parameters which depend on the thermodynamic variables of the system such as pressure and temperature .    the effective pair potential acquires additional new features if the solvent is enriched with particles of medium size such as , e.g. , polymers . if the colloidal particles come close to each other the depletion zones around them , generated by the finite size of the medium particles , overlap leading to an entropically driven attraction of the colloidal particles  @xcite .",
    "correlation effects can modify the form and the range of these depletion forces considerably  @xcite . these effective potentials have indeed turned out to be successful in describing the phase behavior of colloidal suspensions  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively new aspects arise if the solvent particles exhibit a strong cooperative behavior of their own such as a phase transition which proliferates to the effective potential between the large particles .",
    "if the solvent undergoes a continuous phase transition , thermal casimir forces between the large particles are induced due to the geometrical constraint they pose for the critical fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "such forces are long - ranged and have a strong influence on the phase behavior of the colloidal particles  @xcite .",
    "if the solvent is thermodynamically close to a first - order phase transition , wetting phenomena  @xcite can occur at the surfaces of the dissolved particles ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if the bulk phase of the solvent is the vapor phase of a one - component fluid , the surfaces of the large spheres can be covered by a liquidlike wetting film .",
    "this situation corresponds to aerosol particles floating in a vapor . if the bulk phase of the solvent is the a - rich liquid phase of a binary liquid mixture composed of ( small ) a and b molecules , the dissolved colloidal particles can be coated by the b - rich liquid phase of the mixture . if the wet spheres approach each other , at a critical distance the two wetting films snap to a bridgelike structure .",
    "this morphological phase transition is expected to yield a nonanalytic form of the effective interaction potential between the large spheres .",
    "this nonanalyticity demonstrates that cooperative phenomena among those degrees of freedom which are integrated out can leave clearly visible fingerprints on the effective interaction between the remaining relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the study of this kind of profileration is not only of theoretical interest in its own right but seems to play an important ( albeit not exclusive  @xcite ) role for the experimentally observed flocculation of colloidal particles dissolved in a binary liquid mixture close to its demixing transition into an a - rich and a b - rich liquid phase  @xcite .",

    "secondly , it allows one to keep track of the basic molecular interaction potentials of the system .",
    "we focus our interest on thermodynamic states of the solvent which are sufficiently far away from its critical point so that the emerging liquid - vapor interfaces of the wetting films exhibit only a small width .",
    "therefore we can apply the so - called sharp - kink approximation which considers only steplike variations of the solvent density distribution and thus leaves the interface position as the main statistical variable .",
    "this approximation has turned out to be surprisingly accurate for the description of wetting phenomena  @xcite .",
