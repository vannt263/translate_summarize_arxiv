    "a system can retain the information of its motion when it undergoes a cyclic evolution , in the form of a geometric phase , which was first put forward by pancharatnam in optics @xcite and later studied explicitly by berry in a general quantal system @xcite .",
    "since then , great progress has been achieved in this field .",
    "for example , the application of the geometric phase has been proposed in many fields , such as the geometric quantum computation . in this line of work , many physical systems have been investigated to realise geometric quantum computation , such as nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) @xcite , josephson junction @xcite , ion trap @xcite and semiconductor quantum dots @xcite . the quantum computation scheme for the geometric phase has been proposed based on the abelian or non - abelian geometric concepts , and the geometric phase has been shown to be robust against faults in the presence of some kind of external noise due to the geometric nature of berry phase @xcite . then , for isolated quantum systems , the geometric phase is theoretically perfectly understood and experimentally verified . however , it has been shown that the interactions play an important role for the realisation of some specific operations .",
    "as the gates operate slowly compared to the dynamical time scale , they become vulnerable to open system effects and parameters fluctuations that may lead to a loss of coherence . consequently",
    ", the study of the geometric phase was soon extended to open quantum systems .",
    "following this idea , many authors have analysed the correction to the geometric phase under the influence of an external thermal or non - equilibrium environments , using different approaches ( see @xcite ) . in all cases ,",
    "the purely dephasing model considered was a spin-@xmath1 particle coupled to the environment s degrees of freedom through a @xmath2-coupling .",
    "the interest on the geometric phase in open systems has also been extended to some experimental setups @xcite . lately , it has also been observed in a variety of superconducting systems @xcite , and it has been shown the importance of quantifying decoherence when geometric operations are carried out in the presence of low - frequency noise .",
    "all real experiments generally imply the presence of an external environment which induces noise and dissipation on the subsystem depending on the strength of the coupling among them .",
    "memory effects are also considered a relevant source of noise that can affect the dynamics of the system of interest .",
    "thus , a detailed mechanism of decoherence due to external noise sources is still required in order to overcome the effect of a destructive decoherence in measurements of geometric phase .    within a microscopic approach ,",
    "quantum markovian master equations are usually obtained by means of the born - markov approximation , which assumes a weak system - environment coupling and several further , mostly rather drastic approximations @xcite . however , these approximations are not applicable in many processes occurring in nature , such as strong environment couplings , structured and finite reservoirs , low temperatures and large initial system - environment correlations @xcite . in the case of any substantial deviation from the dynamics of a quantum markov process , one often speaks of a non - markovian process , implying that the dynamics is governed by significant memory effects .",
    "unfortunately , a consistent general theory of quantum non - markovianity does not exist and even the very definition of non - markovianity is a highly up - to - date issue .",
    "very recently important steps towards a general theory of non - markovianity have been made .",
    "there has been a great effort to rigorously define the border between markovian and non - markovian quantum dynamics and to develop quantitative measures for the degree of memory effects in open systems @xcite .",
    "the quantification of non - markovianity is justified by the fact that there is increasing evidence of its crucial role as a resource for quantum technologies @xcite .",
    "non - markovianity evolution is often characterised by decoherence phenomena and information trapping , hence leading to longer coherence times in comparison to the markovian case .",
    "as reservoir engineering techniques become experimentally feasible , it is crucial to establish relations between the occurrence of non - markovianity and the form of the environmental spectrum .",
    "recently , there has been many studies on systems whose reduced dynamics are characterised by memory effects .",
    "non - markovian features play an important role in systems where the frequency spectrum of the environment is structured . in ref.@xcite , authors established a connection between the general form of the spectrum and the memory effects in the reduced system dynamics .    in this framework",
    ", this study has been two - folded motivated : on the one side , the need to have a better understanding of the geometric phase in open quantum systems in order to achieve fault tolerance quantum computation . on the other side , the need to understand memory effects as a source of noise for the system of interest . in this manuscript",
    ", we shall study the correction to the geometric phase of a two - level system coupled to an external environment .",
    "we shall use the spin - boson model since it has the advantage of having an analytical solution which can be useful to have a better insight into the onset of non - markovian effects . by the use of the established relation between the form of the reservoir spectrum and the onset of non - markovianity , we shall study the geometric phase of the open system as a function of the `` ohmicity '' of the reservoir , which allows the description of sub - ohmic , ohmic and super - ohmic spectrum .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section ii , we briefly described the model and present both types of environments to be analysed : thermal equilibrium and non - equilibrium ones .",
    "we study the diffusion coefficients and the corresponding decoherence factors .",
    "following ref.@xcite we study the onset of non - markovianity in the environments considered . in section iii",
    ", we compute the geometric phase acquired by the system for different forms of the reservoir spectrum , as function of the ohmicity parameter and study how the memory effects of the environment affect the geometric phase .",
    "finally , in section iv , we shall make our final remarks .",
    "the spin - boson model is studied in a variety of fields , such as condensed matter physics , quantum optics , physical chemistry and quantum information science @xcite in order to describe non - unitary effects induced in quantum systems due to a coupling with an external environment . for a quantum system ,",
    "the influence of the surroundings plays a role at a fundamental level .",
    "when the environment is taken into consideration , the system dynamics can no longer be described in terms of pure quantum states and unitary evolution . from a practical point of view , all real systems interact with an environment , which means that we expect their quantum evolution to be plagued by non - unitary effects , namely dissipation and decoherence .",
    "most theoretical investigations of how the system is affected by the presence of an environment have been done using a thermal reservoir , usually assuming markovian statistical properties and defined bath correlations @xcite ( there are also works on non - markovian models as , just for example , @xcite ) .    in the following",
    ", we shall consider a paradigmatic spin - boson model consisting of a two - level system coupled to an external environment .",
    "we shall consider two different types of environments and see the non - markovian effects : thermal equilibrium and non - equilibrium environment . in both cases",
    ", we shall compute the diffusion and decoherence factor derived by the definition of the corresponding bath correlations and the spectral density @xmath3 , which can be defined for a general environment as : @xmath4 in eq.([densidad ] ) , @xmath5 is the reservoir frequency cutoff and @xmath6 is the coupling constant ( has different units for the different environment considered ) . by changing the value of the @xmath0-parameter",
    "one goes from sub - ohmic reservoirs ( @xmath7 ) to ohmic ( @xmath8 ) and super - ohmic ( @xmath9 ) reservoirs , respectively .",
    "the ohmic spectrum is generally used to describe charged interstitials in metals .",
    "the supra - ohmic environment commonly describes the effect of the interaction between a charged particle and its electromagnetic field .",
    "the sub - ohmic environment is used to model the type of noise occurring in solid state devices due to low frequency modes , similar to the `` 1/f '' noise in josephson junctions .",
    "thus , the description of the spectral density function in terms of a continuous parameter @xmath0 allows to simulate paradigmatic models of open quantum systems by the variation of @xmath0 .",
    "we stress that such engineering of the ohmicity of the spectrum is possible when simulating the dephasing model in trapped ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "we shall start by studying the decoherence effects induced by a thermal equilibrium environment , generally modelled by a set of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the interaction between the two - state system and the environment is entirely represented by a hamiltonian in which the coupling is only through @xmath2 . in this particular case ,",
    "@xmath10=0 $ ] and the corresponding master equation for the reduced density matrix , is much simplified , with neither frequency renormalisation nor dissipation effects .",
    "the hamiltonian of the complete system is written as :    @xmath11    the interaction hamiltonian is only proportional to @xmath2 which means that the populations of the eigenstates remain constant while the off - diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix decay due to the existence of the environment , as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is called the decoherence factor defined as ( see ref.@xcite for details ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the diffusion coefficient , present in the master equation .",
    "it is clear that @xmath16 not only depends on the temperature of the bath but also on the spectral density , particularly on the ohmicity parameter @xmath0 .",
    "+ in ref.@xcite , authors have shown that there exists a link between the onset of non - markovianity and the form of the reservoir spectrum for thermal equilibrium environments as the ones considered here .",
    "they have stated that the crossover is signalled by the onset of periods during which the diffusion rate is negative .",
    "a common feature of all non - markovianity measures is that they are based on the non - monotonic evolution in time of certain coefficients which signal the information back - flow from the environment back to the main system . without memory effects , decoherence rates ( as a quantum channel ) decreases in time monotonically .",
    "however , environment memory effects may produce a non - monotonic behaviour of the quantum channel capacity .",
    "this is related to the convex to non - convex changes of the spectrum .",
    "the condition on the non - convexity of the environmental spectrum is a necessary and sufficient condition for non - markovianity at all temperatures .",
    "this has been set as @xmath17 for zero - t environments .",
    "hence , memory effects leading to information back flow and recoherence occur only if the reservoir spectrum is super - ohmic with @xmath18 .",
    "this means that even if the reduced dynamics is exact , and hence no markovian approximation has been performed , the time evolution of the qubit does not present any memory effects for ohmic and sub - ohmic spectra .",
    "this argument has been derived based on the non - monotonic behaviour of the decoherence factor @xmath16 , and basically it is equivalent to the fact that the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 becomes negative .    in fig.[dif ]",
    ", we present a contour plot for the diffusion coefficient for different equilibrium environments at zero temperature , to show the onset of non - markovianity as derived in @xcite .",
    "we can see the regions where the diffusion coefficient has a negative value , which are related to the onset of non - markovian effects . for example , in fig.[dif ] , we see that for ohmic thermal environments , i.e. @xmath8 in the vertical axis , we always have positive values for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this means that the ohmic environment is always markovian .",
    "for other environment , such as @xmath19 in the vertical axis , we can find regions where the diffusion coefficient gets positive values and areas where the value is negative .",
    "this means that the memory effects become important after some time evolution . +     and the vertical axis is the ohmicity @xmath0 .",
    "the darkest areas are negative values of the diffusion coefficient which has been shown to be related to the onset of non - markovian effects as stated in @xcite .",

    "( [ densidad ] ) and ( [ decof ] ) , the exact decoherence factor as function of time and the ohmicity parameter @xmath0 , can be written as : @xmath22}{s - 1 } \\left[1 - \\left(1 + \\lambda^2t^2\\right)^{-\\frac{s}{2}}\\right .",

    "the decoherence factor is known to be a monotonic decreasing function in time ( blue line in fig.[factorequi ] ) .",
    "however , when the memory effects of the environment become relevant ( for example @xmath19 ) , the decoherence function has not a monotonic behaviour , leading to recoherence phenomena ( red dashed line in fig.[factorequi ] ) .",
    "this is related to the negative regions of the diffusion coefficient as can be seen in fig.[dif ] .      in this subsection",
    ", we shall deal with non - equilibrium environments , represented by random perturbations with non - stationary statistics . the motivation to study these type of environments",
    "is twofold : on one side , the diffusion coefficients computed for different environment spectra have negative parts for all values of the ohmicity parameter .",
    "this means they can be considered as non - markovian environments for all values of the parameter @xmath0 and , contrary to the environments studied above , there is not a critical value of @xmath0 which determines the onset of non - markovianity . on the other side",
    ", these non - equilibrium baths may represent a proposal for engineering reservoirs in a manner reminiscent of a coherent control experiment using shaped pulses @xcite . in this model , the control parameter @xmath24 ,",
    "is derived not from a laser pulse , but rather from well - defined phase relations between the modes of the bath .",
    "the modelling of these non - equilibrium environments implies that the two - level quantum system presents an energy gap @xmath25 which fluctuates due to the influence of the environment , where @xmath26 , with @xmath27 is the instantaneous energy of state @xmath28 as perturbed by the surroundings .",
    "following the idea proposed in @xcite , the bath is represented by a random function of time corresponding to the transition frequency of the two - state quantum system . in contrast to the usual treatment , the statistical properties of this random function are non - stationary , corresponding physically to , for example , impulsively excited phonons of the environment with initial phases that are not random , but which have defined values at @xmath29 .",
    "due to these assumptions , this environment is not at thermal equilibrium .",

    "when compared the correction of the geometric phase induced by these environments and the thermal ones , memory effects of the environments with random noise are more harmful and the correction induced is bigger particularly for values of @xmath93 .    finally , these kind of environments could become a proper experimental setup for the observation of the geometric phase .",
    "our work on the assessment of the environmental effect on the geometric phase , especially in the non - markovian regime ( either for equilibrium or non - equilibrium environments ) could be of great importance in using the geometric phases in two - level systems to implement the quantum gates .",
    "the results presented in this paper can also provide a clue to observe the gp in a two - level system .",

    "<S> we study the geometric phase of a two - level system under the presence of a structured environment , particularly analysing its correction with the ohmicity parameter @xmath0 and the onset of non - markovianity . </S>",
    "<S> we firstly examine the system coupled to a set of harmonic oscillators and studied the decoherence factor as function of the environment s ohmicity parameter . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we propose the two - level system coupled to a non - equilibrium environment , and show that these environments display non - markovian effects for all values of the ohmicity parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric phase of the two - level system is therefore computed under the presence of both types of environment . </S>",
    "<S> the correction to the unitary geometric phase is analysed in both , markovian and non - markovian regimes . under markovian environments , </S>",
    "<S> the correction induced on the system s phase is mainly ruled by the coupling constant between the system and the environment , while in the non - markovian regime , memory effects seem to trigger a significant correction to the unitary geometric phase . </S>",
