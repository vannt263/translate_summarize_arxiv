    "since the discovery @xcite of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor heterostructures in the presence of a high perpendicular magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) , phenomena associated with strongly correlated electrons in the lowest landau level ( lll ) have attracted significant and continuous attention .",
    "@xcite early on , it was realized that the essential many - body physics in the lll could be most effectively grasped through the use of trial wave functions , with celebrated examples being the jastrow - type laughlin @xcite ( jl ) and composite fermion @xcite ( cf ) trial functions associated with the formation of a special class of quantum - liquid states .",
    "@xcite later interest in finite 2d electronic systems , like semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) under high @xmath3 , led to the consideration of a different class of analytic trial functions known as rotating electron ( or wigner ) molecules @xcite ( rems or rwms ) .",
    "an advantage of the rems is that , while they exhibit good total angular momenta , they directly incorporate the molecular ( crystalline ) configurations that dominate the anisotropic pair correlation functions revealed through numerical exact - diagonalization studies for a finite number of electrons under high @xmath3 in a disk geometry .",
    "the initial derivation @xcite of the rem trial functions generated a flare of theoretical activity around the question which class of trial functions ( or combination of them ) is most appropriate for describing the correlated many - body physics in the lll of a small number of electrons @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite furthermore , experimental advances in the field of ultracold trapped neutral atoms have been followed by considerable theoretical activity regarding the nature of correlated states in the lll that are formed during the rapid rotation of the trap ; see , e.g. , refs . .",
    "recent progress in the fabrication of new materials , and in particular in isolating and handling of a single graphene sheet , @xcite offers most promising materials for future , post - silicone , miniaturized electronics@xcite ( sometime called nanoelectronics ) .",
    "this expectation is based on the two - dimensional character of graphene , where the electrons are essentially confined in the spatial direction normal to the graphene plane .",
    "fabrication of nanoscale device elements for use in electronics , spintronics and information processing , such as single - electron transistors , quantum point contacts , and quantum dots , would require additional confinement in the other two spatial dimensions .",
    "however , to achieve the requested additional confinement , techniques ( based on electrostatic gating ) developed for the creation of qds in semiconductors ( such as gaas ) can not be used because of the unique electronic structure of graphene .",
    "the difficulty originates from the relativistic , dirac - like , nature of the low - energy quasiparticles in graphene .",
    "in particular , the gapless nature of the electrons in graphene@xcite allows them to penetrate unimpeded through a high and wide potential barrier .",
    "@xcite this phenomenon , which is known as the klein paradox , @xcite is in fact not a paradox but a consequence of the relativistic character of the electrons , with a sufficiently high potential being repulsive for electrons but attractive for positrons , thus resulting in positron states inside the barrier which can be matched to the electronic continuum states outside , consequently resulting in perfect transmission through the barrier ; the underlying property of the dirac equation is known as the charge - conjugation symmetry .    in light of the above",
    ", one wishes to explore alternative , non - electrostatic methods , for fabrication of lower dimensionality graphene nanostructures .",
    "one route for achieving the desired added planar confinement consists of etching , or cutting graphene into the desired geometry ( e.g. , ribbons , @xcite circular disks , or other shapes @xcite ) .",
    "it is expected that further progress in fabrication , characterization and understanding of the properties of such graphene nanostructures ( in particular zero - dimensional qds ) would lead to their use for the study of interesting many - body phenomena , as well as their employment as components in miniaturized electronic devices .    here",
    "we explore theoretically certain properties of circular graphene quantum dots , defined via cutting the desired shape from a two - dimensional extended sheet .",
    "in particular , we regard investigations of graphene qds as providing an opportunity for reexamination ( and possibly experimental resolution ) of remaining questions concerning the appropriateness of liquid - type vs. molecular - type trial functions for a finite number of 2d electrons . indeed",
    ", it has been known for some time that manifolds of degenerate midgap edge states exist in graphene nanostructures ( such as graphene ribbons ) when they terminate in a zig - zag boundary .",
    "@xcite in a recent paper @xcite it was noted that the single - particle edge states associated with _",
    "graphene dots with zig - zag boundary conditions , and in the absence of an applied magnetic field , display degeneracies and quantum numbers in close analogy with the manifold of single - particle states that form the familiar lll in semiconductor heterostructures at high @xmath3 . furthermore , the numerical calculations of ref .  , covering rather limited ranges of electron numbers ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) and total angular momenta ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) , suggested that the use of quantum - liquid - type trial functions in relation to the graphene lll ( gd - lll ) may be less promising than that of wigner - crystal - type ansatzes .    in this paper , applying a methodology based on angular - momentum projection techniques that was introduced in ref .",
    ", we derive analytic rem trial functions appropriate for the gd - lll . by introducing a single variational parameter",
    ", we demonstrate numerically ( through systematic comparisons with exd calculations ) that the variational variant of the rem ( referred to as vrem ) substantially outperforms the laughlin trial functions ( as well as the ansatz of ref . ) for all values of fractional fillings within the expanded angular - momentum range @xmath7 , and for all of the following larger numbers of electrons @xmath8 and 8 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the low - energy bandstructure of graphene can be described by a linearized tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath9 . for a graphene dot with a circular symmetry this linearized hamiltonian",
    "is given @xcite in polar coordinates by @xmath10 where @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath13 specifies the degenerate in energy valleys for the two bands formed at the @xmath14 and @xmath15 points .",

    ", we will drop the sublattice and valley indices .",
    "we will also assume that the electrons are fully polarized .    since the single - particle angular momentum @xmath29 ( to guarantee normalizability ) , the manifold of such model edge states forms a set of degenerate states similar to the lowest landau level ( lll ) , familiar from the case of 2d semiconductor devices at very high magnetic fields @xmath3 .",
    "we will call the manifold @xcite of degenerate edge states with @xmath29 the graphene - dot lowest landau level ( gd - lll ) .",
    "the main difference [ apart from the normalization constant , see eq .",
    "( 3 ) in ref .  ] between the two cases is that the single - particle states in the usual lll exhibit an additional gaussian multiplicative factor @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the magnetic length .",
    "this gaussian is missing from the expression for the edge states in eqs.([edge1 ] ) and ( [ edge2 ] ) ; instead one has @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "it is thus natural to investigate possible similarities related to fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) physics .",
    "fqhe physics in the lll has been extensively investigated for the case of 2d semiconductor quantum dots.@xcite a main focus has been the underlying nature of the correlated many - body states , i.e. , liquid ( laughlin , composite fermions ) or molecular ( crystalline , rem ) .",
    "detailed comparisons of pair - correlations functions between jl / cf and rem states with exd ones support the view that the molecular ( localized electrons ) picture in semiconductor qds provides the most appropriate description .",
    "the emergence of a gd - lll , as described above in graphene dots offers a further area for testing the appropriateness of liquid - type variational wave functions ( jl / cf ) versus those that describe rems .",
    "first we will proceed with deriving a modified rem trial wave function that takes into consideration the differences between the single - particle states which span the usual lll ( zero - node 2d - harmonic - oscillator states ) and the gd - lll ( edge states ) .",
    "rem analytical wave functions in the lll for electrons in two - dimensional semiconductor quantum dots were derived earlier in ref .  .",
    "the physics underlying such a derivation is based on the theory of symmetry breaking at the mean - field level and of subsequent symmetry restoration via projection techniques .",
