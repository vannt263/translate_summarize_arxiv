    "quasi - one - dimensional intrinsic inhomogeneities called stripes @xcite represent of the most challenging problems in understanding self - organized structures ever since the discovery of high @xmath0 cuprates @xcite .",
    "such textures have been observed in other than superconducting cuprates , most notably in manganites @xcite , nickelates @xcite and rare - earth compounds @xcite .",
    "most recently it has been shown that all cuprates exhibit intrinsic inhomogeneities in some form or another : checkerboard structures have been identified in lightly hole - doped copper oxides @xcite , while the electron - doped cuprates show droplet formations @xcite .",
    "these textures are so predominant in high @xmath0s , that it has been even suggested @xcite as the best candidate for the electron pairing mechanism in these materials .",
    "after the existence of stripes have been established in a broad spectrum of materials , it becomes clear that they emerge due to a microscopic incompatibility between two phases @xcite .",
    "however , this interplay not always leads to stripe formations , but could also lead to droplets ( or blobs ) @xcite as well .",
    "macroscopic inhomogeneity can not occur as long as long - range forces are present .",
    "but when such forces are absent , depending on doping , local inhomogeneities appear in form of stripes or other form of clustering , e.g. , droplets @xcite .    even thought stripes have been known to exist much before high @xmath0 has been discovered @xcite , their theoretical understanding lacks rigorous description .",
    "hereafter we want to fill this gap .",
    "hence we present an exact solution of a generalized periodic anderson model ( pam ) with ground states exhibiting intrinsic inhomogeneities of the stripe , checkerboard and droplets type . using a two band model as a starting point of our analyses it even renders the obtained results to be more generally applicable , since real materials are mostly of multi - band type .",
    "these models are usually addressed by projecting the multi - band structure into a few - band picture @xcite , which we stop for mathematical convenience , at a two band level . however , our study is not a simple two - band model but rather an extended pam which contains the added feature of strong correlation effects originating from the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath1 present in the correlated ( @xmath2 ) band , an arbitrary @xmath3 extra hubbard interaction in the free ( @xmath4 ) band , leaves our results unchanged .",
    "since stripes and checkerboards are observed in a broad spectrum of materials , we are primarily focusing on ground states which exhibit these inhomogeneities , being less interested in the properties of the homogeneous phases in which they appear .",
    "our exact results can be summarized as follows .",
    "below quarter filling , two stripe ground states emerge .",
    "one ( @xmath5 ) with insulating and paramagnetic stripes , while the second one ( @xmath6 ) with itinerant and ferromagnetic stripe lines .",
    "this second solution allows checkerboard structures as well . in both cases ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the inter - stripe line regions contain empty sites , hence are insulating .",
    "the obtained ground states are in general degenerate .",
    "the degeneracy is provided by a random blob structure corresponding to the same energy , the blobs ( random shape clusters ) possessing the same properties as the stripe lines in cases @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state can however be lifted , the resulting non - degenerate ground state remaining of pure stripe or checkerboard character .",
    "the lifting factor we find may have different physical origin as distortion lines , dimerization or periodic charge displacement ( density waves ) .",
    "the obtained stripe formation processes are generic and are less sensitive to the properties of the homogenous phases present at quarter filling .",
    "we further note that marginal to the stripe problem , but interesting for the pam itself , we were able to prove rigorously that the studied 2d pam is ferromagnetic at quarter filling in a restricted region of its parameter space .",
    "similar result has been recently reported for 3d pam as well @xcite .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "sec.ii presents the exact transformation of the hamiltonian in a positive semidefinite form , sec.iii .",
    "describes the obtained ground state solutions , sec.iv . presents a discussion of the obtained results , and sec.v . concluding the paper , closes the presentation .",
    "our starting hamiltonian is thus , @xmath7 , written for a free ( @xmath4 ) and a correlated ( @xmath2 ) band , where we allow for hopping in both bands : @xmath8 + v_{0}(\\hat{d}_{{\\bf i},\\sigma } ^{\\dagger }",

    "the coordinate @xmath17 , with possible values @xmath18 , is allowed to extend to _ all _ sites of @xmath9 . within the unit cell @xmath19 defined at @xmath20 , the lattice sites @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , can be numbered by @xmath24 without reference to @xmath25 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a ) .",
    "the correlated @xmath2 band has in addition @xmath26 , acting on it with @xmath27 on - site hubbard repulsion .",
    "it is known that exact solutions exist mostly in 1d systems and in higher dimensions is almost impossible to find rigorous results .",
    "thus , to find the exact ground state of @xmath28 in 2d we use a method which is based on transforming @xmath28 into a representation which is positive semidefinite . quantum mechanics tells us that the minimum possible eigenvalue of a positive semidefinite operator , e.g. , @xmath29 , is zero . hence the ground state , e.g. , @xmath30 of @xmath29 can be constructed from @xmath31 .",
    "the fact that ground states containing intrinsic inhomogeneities can be obtained in this manner for a , , non - integrable  @xcite model as 2d - pam does not come as a surprise , since the applied procedure works even in disordered case @xcite .",
    "we further note that the method is described in details in ref . and has been previously used to solve generalized pam type models at @xmath32 filling in 2d @xcite and even in 3d @xcite . in the present case the transformation",
    "is performed in 2d at a lower filling region , which is described in 2d for the first time in this paper .",
    "the transformation proceeds in the following way : first we transform exactly the starting hamiltonian in a positive semidefinite form .",
    "this is accomplished with the use of the operators @xmath33 which are linear combination of the original fermionic operators acting on the corners of an elementary plaquette , see fig  [ fig1 ] a ) .",
    "it can be easily seen that @xmath34 contains exactly the same operators from eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) . hence , properly choosing the coefficients @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 from eq .",

    ", the ground state is reached only if touching @xmath79 operators defined on different sites [ for example @xmath91 in fig .",

    "this state is itinerant and represents a fully saturated ferromagnet up to @xmath98 . in the limit @xmath99",
    "there is always a possibility for a new block to appear on the lattice , in a way that is not in contact with other blocks and as such it can have opposite spin .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] a ) , the middle block @xmath100 is isolated and has opposite spin compared to the big block surrounding it .",
    "hence , for @xmath101 the ground state is not anymore fully saturated . further decreasing @xmath46 ,",
    "the ground state remains ferromagnetic @xcite until two disjoint blocks with the same number of sites but opposite spins can be constructed .",
    "this happens at @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .",

    "for example , from ( [ e3 ] ) , the vertical stripes are obtained in case @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) by a displacement along periodic vertical lines ( vertically constructed plaquette columns ) of @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) operators . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] a ) case @xmath5 is shown with column stripes , while fig .",

    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] b ) ] and stripe solutions coexist as the ground state is degenerate .",
    "however , the droplet contributions can be eliminated in exact terms from the ground state by adding new hamiltonian contributions to @xmath48 .",
    "for example , let us consider @xmath115 , where @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath117 contains all lattice sites from @xmath118 and @xmath119 holds , then @xmath120 \\hat { \\cal d}^{\\dagger}_{i'_{st } } = \\hat { \\cal d}^{\\dagger}_{i'_{st}}[n + \\sum_{{\\bf i } \\in i_{st } } \\hat n _ { \\bf i}]$ ] provides the minimum possible eigenvalue for @xmath121 via @xmath122 . if however , @xmath123 [ for example , if @xmath124 moves to the in @xmath125 position , fig .

    "the potential @xmath129 in @xmath130 can be generated by a periodic charge displacement or charge density wave ( see fig .  [ fig7 ] ) , which is able to stabilize a stripe phase .",
    "such a behavior has been already seen @xcite in cuprates .",
    "similarly , the checkerboard state also can be made stable @xcite .",
    "a checkerboard is obtained , for example in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] b ) , if we take @xmath131 .",
    "this is stabilized by a hamiltonian term @xmath121 , which has a set of lattice sites @xmath132 , in such a way that it contains only next - nearest - neighbor sites on each second diagonal .",
    "furthermore , the vertical stripes from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] b ) , will be stabilized by a dimerization term of the form @xmath133 , @xmath134 , where @xmath135 contains only each second site of horizontal lattice rows @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . for @xmath136",
    "described in ref .  , the stable stripe phase occurs above the surface presented in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . modifying @xmath135 ,",
    "other stripes can be addressed as well .",
    "the important effect of dimerization on stripes stabilization have been recently shown using numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the obtained inhomogeneities are not connected in principle neither to certain special values of the parameters , nor to special properties of the homogeneous phases present at quarter filling . in the following we present several remarks to support this and in closing the obtained stripe formation process is summarized .",
    "firstly , for a given hamiltonian , a given decomposition in positive semidefinite operators at a given filling factor is not unique @xcite .",
    "the decomposition itself can be done in several different ways , leading to different @xmath54 operators , different matching conditions , hence different interdependencies between microscopic parameters obtained during the solution of the matching conditions ( i.e. equations of the type ( [ cond ] ) ) , providing similar solutions , and similar characteristics in different regions of the parameter space .",
    "for example , as shown in ref.[@xcite ] , instead of plaquettes , rhombi can also be used in defining @xmath54 , obtaining the same type of solutions , but in other regions of the parameter space .",
    "other possibilities are to simply tilt the unit cell @xcite , or to decompose in @xmath137 , where @xmath138 , as described in ref.[@xcite ] , etc .",
    "secondly , the different solutions of the matching conditions all give homogeneous phase at quarter filling .",
    "stripes will appear from each of these homogeneous phases with ( hole ) doping .",
    "this can be easily understood from the observation that the @xmath61 ( or @xmath139 ) operators which are characteristic of the stripe ground state , see eg , eqs.([ab],[opb ] ) , can appear for arbitrary @xmath54 .",
    "consequently , the obtained stripe formation process is weakly dependent on the properties of the homogeneous phase from which the stripes emerge .",
    "thirdly , each homogenous phase ( and hence each stripe structure originating from it ) appears for different , well - defined conditions .",
    "for example , see also ref.[@xcite ] , stripes with ferromagnetic and itinerant stripe lines can be obtained from the itinerant ferromagnetic homogenous phase when the one particle part of the hamiltonian in ( [ ham ] ) has such parameters that @xmath37 will have a diagonalized partially filled lower flat band .",
    "one the other hand , insulating paramagnetic stripe lines are obtained in a different parameter space region , where localized homogenous phase can occur , etc .",
    "fourthly , an additional repulsive hubbard term acting in the @xmath4-band will not change the obtained results .",
    "consequently , the obtained ground states and inhomogeneities are valid not only in the 2d pam , but also in a more general 2d two - band hubbard model as well .",
    "lastly , in our rigorous description we obtained a non - degenerate ground state exhibiting stripe structure in the following steps : we doped the homogeneous phase at quarter filling .",
    "this resulted in a degenerate ground state to appear , which contained both random droplets and stripe solutions . in the last step we lifted the degeneracy by adding a so - called stabilization term to the hamiltonian . by doing this",
    "we eliminated the random droplets from the degenerated ground state , obtaining providing a non - degenerated stripe ground state solution .",
    "in conclusion , providing exact results for stripe , checkerboard vs. droplet interplay , we show how such intrinsic inhomogeneities appear in a 2d hamiltonian as a non - degenerate ground states . for this ,",
    "1 ) a generalized pam is used and cast in a positive semidefinite form , 2 ) the ground states are explicitly constructed at and below quarter filling , and 3 ) the ground state degeneracy provided by random droplets is eliminated using extension terms representing , e.g. , distortion lines , dimerization or density waves . the inhomogeneities were shown to exist in a broad concentration range below quarter filling and they are either ( case @xmath5 ) paramagnetic and localized , or ( case @xmath6 ) itinerant and ferromagnetic . in both of these cases",
    "the inter - stripe lines are insulating .",
    "as has been underlined , stripes can emerge from different homogeneous phases so are less sensitive to microscopic parameters of @xmath48 .",
    "as marginal for the stripes , but important for pam we derive an exact ferromagnetic ground state , as well , in @xmath140 at quarter filling . an extra hubbard interaction in the @xmath4 band , @xmath3 leaves the above results unchanged .",
    "the presented positive semidefinite decomposition is not unique , can be effectuated in several ways , leading to similar results also in other regions of the parameter space .",
