    "strontium copper boron oxide ( srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 ) is a two - dimensional antiferromagnet with no long - range magnetic order.@xcite heisenberg interactions between the @xmath2 magnetic moments are strong and the geometry is such that the planes of spin dimers are coupled in a way equivalent to those of the shastry - sutherland model .",
    "@xcite this model had been proposed on purely theoretical grounds , and is remarkable in that while strongly interacting , it has an _ exact _ dimer ground state , fully isotropic in spin - space , up to a critical value of the coupling.@xcite it is not integrable , however , and neither the excited states , nor their dispersions are known exactly .",
    "this motivated many studies of the dynamics of this model .",
    "the existence of a compound which is well modeled by the shastry - sutherland hamiltonian , and what is more , is in an intermediate range of coupling , not far from a quantum critical point , is then of great interest .",
    "the spin excitations of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 have been studied extensively by a variety of experimental techniques ( see _ e.g. _ [ ] and references below ) .",
    "an immediate question is how to extract the couplings and to give a precise answer to the question : to what extent srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 can be described by the shastry - sutherland model ?",
    "the first observation is that while the shastry - sutherland model and its ground state are rotationally invariant , srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 shows departures from spin isotropy .",
    "electron spin resonance ( esr),@xcite far - infrared spectroscopy of forbidden transitions,@xcite neutron inelastic scattering,@xcite or latter raman scattering@xcite have shown the splitting of the spin triplet excitations at @xmath3 and anisotropic behavior with respect to the direction of an external magnetic field .",
    "this was explained@xcite as originating from a dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( a correction of spin - orbit origin)@xcite whose characteristic vector is oriented perpendicular to the copper planes , along the @xmath4-direction of the crystal . while spin - orbit interactions always introduce anisotropies at some energy scale , it was a surprise that in a frustrated model they could dominate the dispersion which generally arises from larger , isotropic , couplings .",
    "more recently , other components of the vectors were argued to be required to explain further experimental findings : another splitting was observed at @xmath5,@xcite and was subsequently associated with in - plane components of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions . in addition , there is an avoided level crossing when the first triplet state is about to cross the ground state for magnetic fields applied along @xmath4 .",
    "this is not compatible with a single - axis anisotropy along the same direction , and requires additional forms of anisotropy .",
    "the level anti - crossing was argued to be due to the nearest neighbor dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction,@xcite which was considered as a possible explanation for the x - band esr as well.@xcite all these components are indeed allowed by the symmetry of the crystal structure in the low temperature phase of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0,@xcite whose copper planes are slightly buckled . were it not buckled ( as in the high temperature phase@xcite ) , these components would have vanished .",
    "it was for this reason that they were neglected in the original interpretation of the neutron inelastic scattering.@xcite nonetheless , because the symmetry is slightly broken these interactions are expected to be present and define a smaller energy scale .    a precise model for srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 must therefore include , in addition to the larger heisenberg couplings , a complex pattern of dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions .",
    "since their relative strengths are not precisely known , it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among them , other than the probable dominance of the @xmath4 axis component .    in this paper , we argue , on the basis of exact transformations and numerical diagonalizations , that we can simplify the model and determine the parameters of the transformed model by studying the dispersion of the triplet states .",
    "the dispersion of the triplet states of the shastry - sutherland model , taken alone , is very small , and this is why smaller interactions are relevant , and even turn out to be dominant.@xcite it is natural to consider dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions since they are linear in the ratio of the spin - orbit coupling to the crystal - field splitting , @xmath6 , which is estimated from the @xmath7-factor , _ i.e. _ @xmath8 to be about 0.1 .",
    "they are , however , peculiar , in that they are usually expected to have little effect on the spectrum , at most @xmath9.@xcite it has even been claimed that dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions and second - order symmetric anisotropic couplings conspire to restore the rotational invariance of the spin excitation spectrum.@xcite while this can be true for single - band models in certain geometries , here the frustration of the lattice makes such arguments inapplicable , as we shall see .",
    "we can in fact classify the dzyaloshinskii - moriya components into _ reducible _ components ( that can be reduced to @xmath9 effects ) and _ irreducible _ components that have effects on the dispersion linear in the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the latter thus defines a larger energy scale which will be the focus of our discussion .",
    "the problem then is to calculate the spin excitation spectrum reliably .",
    "if only isotropic interactions are considered , srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 is very close in parameter space ( @xmath10 ) to a quantum critical point,@xcite ( @xmath11 ) , which separates the dimer phase ( which is known exactly ) to a phase that is not known exactly but may be quadrumerized.@xcite perturbative approaches to the excitations may therefore turn out to be inaccurate . for instance , the splitting of the @xmath3 triplet energy is given by @xmath12 , which is linear in @xmath13 and involves a function @xmath14 with @xmath15 , but @xmath16 for @xmath17@xcite .",
    "this is difficult to calculate by perturbative techniques because of the proximity with the quantum critical point .",
    "therefore , in order to explain the dispersion of the first triplet states in srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 , we need not only to include the relevant dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , but also to go beyond the perturbative techniques used earlier for the dispersion.@xcite indeed , even carried at high order in perturbation theory , such calculations may tend to overestimate the dispersion , as we shall see .",
    "for these reasons , we have carried out an exact numerical study of the model , including the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions .",
    "in addition to symmetry - allowed components of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya vectors , other components , that are not allowed by the measured crystal symmetry were invoked@xcite as possible explanations for the specific heat and the esr `` forbidden '' transition .",
    "we shall not consider them here because , on one hand , no distortions of the crystal structure that would allow them have been reported so far,@xcite and electric - dipole - transitions provide a symmetry - preserving alternative to explain forbidden transitions.@xcite although it is not clear whether esr are of magnetic - dipole or electric - dipole nature , it has been shown that the forbidden transitions observed by far infrared spectroscopy were clearly electric - dipole.@xcite even if the esr transitions were magnetic - dipole , they could possibly be explained by finite - temperature effects.@xcite these components , not allowed by the symmetry , seem therefore unnecessary at our current state of knowledge .",
    "those components which are allowed by symmetry , however , are most probably important to understand refined experiments , such as the high - field plateau phases@xcite where typical condensation energies are much smaller than the isotropic couplings .",
    "for instance , the 1/8 plateau width is of order of 1 kelvin and it is questionable whether heisenberg models alone capture the essential superstructure of that phase .",
    "this provides further motivation to quantify to what extent the isotropic model applies to srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 , and in what circumstances the anisotropic couplings can be safely neglected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ unfrustrated ] ,",
    "we give the dispersion of the first - triplet excitations for the heisenberg shastry - sutherland model . in section [ model ] , we present the anisotropic model for srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 with dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , and in ( [ mapping ] ) map it onto a simpler model .",
    "we then calculate the magnon dispersion both perturbatively ( section [ perturbation ] ) , and by exact diagonalization of finite lattices ( section [ diagonalization ] ) .",
    "we discuss experimental results in section [ exp ] and extract the couplings that previously could not be quantified by comparing exact spectra with experimental results .",
    "we first consider the shastry - sutherland model@xcite ( with no dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ) , as originally used@xcite to describe srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for nearest neighbors ( intra - dimer ) and @xmath20 for next nearest neighbors ( inter - dimer ) .",
    "the lattice of couplings is as shown in figure [ lattice ] : nearest neighbour couplings are on the diagonals in every second square of the lattice of next - nearest - neighbour couplings ( in the real lattice the angles are such that the diagonals are shorter ) .",
    "the strengths of the heisenberg couplings are @xmath21 kelvin for the nearest - neighbor coupling , and @xmath22 for the next - nearest - neighbor coupling , as determined@xcite from susceptibility measurements .",
    "an interplane coupling is present , but it is small ( @xmath23 k ) and frustrated.@xcite we therefore restrict ourselves to a two - dimensional version of the model and neglect @xmath24 .",
    "the ratio @xmath25 was confirmed to be consistent with the ratio of the first raman - active singlet energy to the first triplet energy,@xcite a measure independent of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we calculate a few low - lying states of the shastry - sutherland model [ hamiltonian ( [ eqn : ssm ] ) ] on a 32-site cluster using exact diagonalization .",
    "this cluster is particularly attractive compared to smaller ones not only because it has smaller finite size effects , but also because it allows access to the important symmetry points @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 [ ] .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "[ nodm ] for @xmath17 .",
    "the gap between the ground state and the triplet state is @xmath29 for the 32-site cluster and essentially independent of the system - size as shown in table  [ bandwidth ] . yet",
    "the absence of finite - size effects on the gap does not mean that all energies have reached their thermodynamic limit .",
    "in fact the dispersion of the 16-site cluster is much flatter than that of the 20 or 32-site clusters .",
    "it has appeared before ( but for the simple square lattice ) that the 16-site cluster can be quite special compared with larger clusters.@xcite comparison of the bandwidths of the 20-site and 32-site clusters is also difficult because the reciprocal points are not identical . in particular the bandwidth of the 20-site cluster",
    "is inherently smaller because of the absence of the @xmath27 reciprocal point : the only non - zero point in reciprocal space is at @xmath30 .",
    "therefore while finite - size effects are definitely smaller than the table  [ bandwidth ] might suggest it is not possible to quantify them at present . in absolute values",
    ", the bandwidth of the 32-site cluster remains very small , @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ about @xmath32 kelvin .",
    "we note that it is smaller than that of the perturbative calculation,@xcite although this may be explained in part by finite - size effects , but is also qualitatively different in shape .",
    "consistent with the fact that there are two dimers per unit - cell , we have in fact not one but two triplet states which are degenerate at high symmetry points of reciprocal space .",
    "the degeneracies are slightly lifted for intermediate q - values .",
    "this splitting was shown to occur at higher order , @xmath33 in perturbation theory.@xcite the gap and especially the dispersion relation are in fact much more affected by the smaller anisotropic interactions , as will be shown in the next section .    . the spin gap and bandwidth of the first triplet excitation in the shastry - sutherland model for different cluster sizes .",

    "we now consider a model with dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , based on the symmetries of the low temperature phase.@xcite the model contains isotropic couplings,@xcite and both inter - dimer@xcite and intra - dimer dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions.@xcite it reads : @xmath35 \\nonumber   \\\\ & + & \\sum_{nnn } \\left[j^{\\prime } \\textbf{\\mbox{s}}_i .",

    "eventually only one parameter remains to be determined and we will determine it with the help of the magnon dispersion at finite wave - vector .",
    "we map the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) onto a simpler hamiltonian with no intra - dimer and no uniform dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , by means of rotations@xcite of spin operators .",
    "contrary to previous situations where this approach has been applied,@xcite it turns out here that we can not eliminate all components , because of the frustration of the lattice but we can nonetheless simplify the model .",
    "for this , we perform two sorts of rotations . first , we rotate the two spin operators of the dimers in opposite directions , and apply the same operation to all unit cells .",
    "second , we rotate the spin operators from dimer to dimer by applying the same operation to the two spin operators of the same dimer . the first transformation uses local rotations ( the same for all unit - cells ) for the two spins @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the dimer @xmath64 , that are defined by : @xmath65 \\hat{\\textbf{\\mbox{e}}}_{ij } + \\cos\\frac { \\theta}{2 } \\textbf{\\mbox{s}}_i - \\sin \\frac { \\theta}{2 } \\textbf{\\mbox{s}}_i \\times \\hat{\\textbf{\\mbox{e}}}_{ij }   \\label{transformation } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath66,@xcite where @xmath59 and @xmath67 are defined by ( [ ddef ] ) .",

    "in fact the transformation ( [ transformation ] ) does produce some anisotropic exchange of order @xmath69,@xcite which we neglect because ( i ) we have not taken into account real anisotropic couplings which occur at the same order of magnitude , and more importantly , ( ii ) the spectrum is fully dominated by effects that are linear in @xmath59 , as we shall show .    in terms of the primed spins , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",

    "we can simply understand these additional splittings by perturbation theory : couplings with higher energy states open gaps which scale as @xmath151 ( which we verified by exact diagonalization ) .",
    "the exact calculation shows other @xmath9 effects . we can not make quantitative comparison of effects at this order to real experiments because anisotropic super - exchange is also present at order @xmath9 and are neglected in the present work .",
    "@xmath9 effects may perhaps be accessible to esr at @xmath3 , but it might be difficult to disentangle the second - order effects of dzyaloshinskii - moriya from that of real asymmetric couplings .",
    "_ triplet states .",
    "_ we now use these results to extract the anisotropic couplings from neutron inelastic scattering experiments . at @xmath3",
    ", we have seen that the energy is unchanged between the 20-site cluster@xcite and the present 32-site cluster , so the estimation of @xmath152 mev is unmodified . regarding the intensity at @xmath3 ,",
    "earlier perturbative calculation@xcite compares well with exact numerical diagonalization on a 20-site cluster,@xcite so we have not carried out intensity calculations on the 32-site problem , but will rely on perturbative results . at @xmath5 , we have seen indeed that the intensity of the middle mode is zero ( section [ perturbation ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of vanishing intensity for the middle mode in neutron scattering.@xcite the splitting seen at @xmath5 can therefore be interpreted as the gap between the lower and upper state .",
    "as we have seen , the splitting at @xmath5 is given by @xmath153 , with @xmath154 and @xmath155 ( which is in fact within 1 % of the perturbative result ) .",
    "this allows to extract @xmath156 mev , taking a splitting @xmath157 mev @xcite .",
    "this is the value we extracted before relying on the perturbative expression.@xcite we have here calculated the renormalization coefficient at @xmath28 , and shown that that coefficient is quite different from that at @xmath158 ; therefore applying the same renormalization to both splittings@xcite leads to an artificially large in - plane dzyaloshinskii - moriya coupling .",
    "this explains why the ratio appeared so large previously .",
    "in fact , the correct ratio is @xmath159 with @xmath160 mev .",
    "we recall that @xmath91 is a linear combination of two interactions ( see below ) , and as such may explain why it is larger than expected on the basis of the small buckling of the crystal structure .",
    "we therefore conclude that from the splittings at @xmath107 and @xmath5 , we constrain the couplings : @xmath161 these values also explain the dispersion of the excitations as shown in fig .",
    "[ dmexp ] , at least for the additional reciprocal points available in the 32-site cluster ( diamonds ) .",
    "note that the scales of experiment and numerical calculations are slightly shifted .",
    "the shift could be eliminated by an optimized choice of @xmath72 in the range 0.62 - 0.63 , consistent with previous estimates .    how could we , at least in principle , determine individually @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ? as we have shown , the effect of dzyaloshinskii - moriya on the spectrum is large only for the two effective components that could not be eliminated by our transformations . to determine the other components ,",
    "the effect of an external magnetic field may provide more constraints . however , staggered gyromagnetic tensors come into play , that are also unknown .",
    "alternatively , we can use neutron scattering _",
    "intensities_. first , we calculate the correction to the expressions of the intensities ( eq .",
    "( [ i01 ] ) or ( [ i02 ] ) ) at @xmath5 , coming from the intra - dimer dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , @xmath59 .",
    "indeed the spin operators @xmath110 have a linear correction in @xmath59 ( see eq .",
    "( [ transformation ] ) ) that we have neglected so far .",
    "the intensity at @xmath5 ( that was zero before ) acquires a term proportional to @xmath162 : @xmath163 where @xmath164 .",
    "so in principle it is possible to extract @xmath59 from measuring the ratio of intensities at @xmath5 , @xmath165 .",
    "this ratio is very small @xmath166 , and it therefore seems difficult to extract this coupling independently .",
    "second , we consider the effect on the intensities of the non - staggered components @xmath167 , that we had eliminated by the second rotation . since the rotation is performed using a constant angle when going from dimer to dimer , the spin operators @xmath110 contains operators that are shifted in @xmath114 space , @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is determined by the coupling @xmath167 .",
    "a consequence is that `` ghosts '' of the original magnon dispersion ( as given in fig .",
    "[ dm ] ) shifted by @xmath170 must appear in the spectrum .",
    "of course because the shift is small , of order @xmath6 , and the dispersion is of the same order , the energies are changed by @xmath9 .",
    "the effect will be difficult to detect by neutron scattering using constant wave - vector scans , but could appear in constant energy scans .",
    "this is reminiscent of magnon dispersions in well ordered systems , such as ba@xmath0cuge@xmath0o@xmath171 , where the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and the helicoidal magnetic structure give rise to three branches in the excitation spectrum.@xcite    _ singlet states . _ in figs .",
    "[ dm ] and [ d ] , higher and lower _ singlet _ states are also given .",
    "since the rotational symmetry is broken , denoting a state as a `` singlet''is to be understood as its property for vanishing anisotropies .",
    "singlets are not directly visible by esr , because the external field is swept at constant wavelengths and only field - dependent states are detected .",
    "nonetheless the bending of the triplet energy levels tend to signal a level anti - crossing with a singlet : experimentally such bendings were observed and thus singlet energies indirectly measured.@xcite the measured anti - crossings are at 2.67 mev ( compared to the lowest triplet state at 2.81 mev ) and 3.56 mev ( compared to the higher triplet at 3.16 mev).@xcite in fig .",
    "[ dm ] the lowest singlet has an energy which is 95% of the triplet gap , in good agreement with the experimental figure .",
    "however the second singlet seems to be higher in energy compared to that of fig .  [ dm ] .",
    "we know that there are other singlet states at higher energies , and that observed by esr may be one of them",
    ".    _ sign of the coupling_. we remark that although the sign of @xmath77 is of no consequence on the energy spectrum , it interchanges the `` handedness '' of the wave functions of the upper and lower states .",
    "it therefore has measurable consequences when polarized light interacts with the triplets.@xcite it is interesting to note that the sign of @xmath77 extracted by analyzing@xcite far - infrared experiments@xcite is opposite to that suggested to explain avoided crossing at higher fields.@xcite the apparent contradiction may be resolved because the avoided crossing is not determined solely by @xmath59 , as suggested earlier@xcite . but rather by a combination of @xmath172 , @xmath167 and the staggered fields .",
    "quantitative understanding of the avoided crossing would need determination of each individual coupling .",
    "we have considered a model for srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 with all the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions compatible with the crystal structure , _",
    "i.e. _ a model with all anisotropic couplings linear in the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we have constructed a simpler anisotropic hamiltonian ( [ hammapped1 ] ) with a smaller number of couplings , by appropriate mappings , which has nonetheless exactly the same spectrum up to second - order interactions .",
    "the transformation allowed us to separate what we term the `` reducible '' components of dzyaloshinskii - moriya vectors ( the non - staggered components @xmath61 and part of the intra - dimer interaction @xmath59 ) from the `` irreducible '' ( the staggered @xmath77 , @xmath60 with a contribution from the intra - dimer interaction @xmath59 ) . by definition",
    "the latter have effects on the spin excitation spectrum that are linear in the strength of the coupling , whereas the former have second - order effects .",
    "the linear effect arises , precisely , because we can not eliminate these components .",
    "had we been able to eliminate all of them , we should have taken into account anisotropic symmetric _ exchanges _ , on an equal footing.@xcite in that case , depending on the underlying superexchange processes , one may recover a fully rotationally invariant spectrum ( if single - orbital processes are dominant),@xcite or not ( when multi - orbital processes exist).@xcite in any case , the effects would have been at most @xmath9 , and very difficult to extract experimentally because this would be of order of a few @xmath173ev .",
    "in contrast , srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 represents a real situation where the bond frustration leads to an energy scale of order @xmath6 -hundreds of @xmath173ev here- in the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "we have explained quantitatively the dispersion of the lowest triplet states ( fig .",
    "[ dmexp ] ) which is dominated by dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions ( compare fig .",
    "[ nodm ] and [ dm ] ) .",
    "first - order perturbation theory was not sufficient to account quantitatively for the dispersion shape ( see fig .",
    "[ noj ] ) but allows us to capture most of the symmetries except for the small additional splittings due to the presence of two dimers per unit - cell .",
    "measurements of the dispersion under high - pressure@xcite should in fact be carefully interpreted : the evolution of the bandwidth with pressure should primarily reflect the change in the dzyaloshinskii - moriya couplings and not the change in the ratio @xmath72 that measure the proximity to the critical point .",
    "the spin gap , where the effect of dzyaloshinskii - moriya is secondary , may serve as a more sensitive probe for the proximity to the critical point .",
    "the model ( [ hammapped1 ] ) whose parameters have been quantitatively determined , may serve as a good starting point to understand other properties of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 at zero field , such as higher energy bound states .",
    "these states , as observed in particular by esr,@xcite raman scattering,@xcite far - infrared spectroscopy,@xcite and neutron scattering @xcite have been analyzed so far within the framework of the shastry - sutherland model,@xcite but should be affected by dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions .",
    "this may explain the splittings observed,@xcite and resolve the issue of `` localization '' versus `` delocalization '' of these excitations .",
    "the large dispersion seen first in ref . [ ] and supported by theoretical calculations on the shastry - sutherland model was revealed latter to be composed of several more localized excitations.@xcite this remains to be fully understood and model ( [ hammapped1 ] ) may help .",
    "we have focused on zero - field results : finite field effects are particularly interesting but involve other unknown couplings .",
    "if the mappings of section  [ mapping ] ( transformations ( [ transformation ] ) and ( [ transformation2 ] ) ) are made with an external magnetic - field , both an effective staggered field,@xcite and rotating fields appear . as a real staggered field",
    "is already present according to the local symmetry of the copper ions , the net effective fields can not be known precisely .",
    "the level anti - crossing that was found when the spin gap is about to close for a magnetic - field along the @xmath4 direction , in particular , can not be solely due to the intra - dimer interaction , as previously claimed.@xcite it has to be seen as a consequence of all these effects : intra and inter - dimer components , and staggered fields .",
    "interesting developments for doped samples of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 are underway.@xcite the doped compounds , by breaking translation invariance , may also help to disentangle the different components of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya vectors , by studying the induced magnetization of the magnetic ions in the vicinity of the dopant , by nmr for instance .",
