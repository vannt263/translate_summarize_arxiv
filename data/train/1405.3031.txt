    ", it is natural to imagine that the thermal conductivity in the few - layer graphene ( flg ) should exhibit some dimensional crossover behavior with increasing thickness .",
    "this dimensional crossover was observed in the experiment in 2010 , which shows that the thermal conductivity in flg decreases exponentially with increasing thickness.@xcite the reduced thermal conductivity is attributed to the enhanced three - phonon umklapp scattering .",
    "it results from the increased scattering channels , owning to more phonon branches in thicker flg .",
    "this dimensional crossover phenomenon has been investigated theoretically through either the boltzmann approach@xcite or the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation.@xcite    in all of these theoretical works , the interlayer interaction is described by the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath0 .",
    "the lj potential gives good description for the cohesive behavior of graphene layers .",
    "however , it has been shown by kolmogorov and crespi that the lj potential provides only small energy variation in the relative alignment of adjacent graphene layers;@xcite i.e the lj potential is insensitive to the registry .",
    "this energy variation actually should be much larger , as it is the result of the overlap between @xmath1 electrons from adjacent layers .",
    "this @xmath1-overlap is also responsible for the significant red - shift of the raman g mode with increasing thickness of the flg.@xcite the interlayer interaction will have direct effect on the interlayer phonon modes in the flg .",
    "there are two groups of interlayer phonon modes in the flg , i.e the interlayer breathing mode@xcite and the interlayer shear mode.@xcite from their eigen vector morphology , it can be shown that the interlayer breathing mode is insensitive to the registry effect while the interlayer shear mode is highly sensitive to the registry effect . from above",
    ", the lj potential can describe the interlayer breathing mode in the flg , but it gives much lower frequency for the interlayer shear mode .    to include the registry effect , it is necessary to develop a registry - dependent ( rd ) potential , which contains explicit dependence on the relative shearing morphology.@xcite",
    "a natural question arises : is this registry effect important on the thermal conductivity of flg ?",
    "this question has not been addressed yet .",
    "we will answer it by comparatively calculating thermal conductivity of flg with interlayer interaction described by either lj or rd potential .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the registry effect on the thermal conductivity of flg , using classical md simulations .",
    "the interlayer interaction is described by either the lj or the rd potential .",
    "our calculations show that the thermal conductivity from both potentials are very close to each other , which indicates that the registry effect is actually not important .",
    "it is because both potentials give similar description for the interlayer breathing mode , and the thermal transport in few - layer graphene is mainly limited by the interlayer breathing mode rather than the interlayer shear mode .",
    "we also find that the thickness dependence of the thermal conductivity in flg is sensitive to its size and the temperature .",
    "in our simulations , the intralayer carbon - carbon interaction is described by the brenner potential.@xcite for the interlayer interaction , we employ two potentials to describe it .",
    "similar as existing works , we first apply the lj potential , with @xmath2 mev and @xmath3  nm . the cut - off is 1.0  nm .",
    "the two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are fitted to experimental values for the interlayer space and the phonon dispersion along @xmath6 direction in graphite.@xcite    we also apply the rd potential to describe the interlayer interaction .",
    "present calculations use the rd potential developed by lebedeva _",
    "et.al_ , which provides reasonable prediction of the shearing energy barrier in bilayer graphene.@xcite the interaction between two carbon atoms from different graphene layers is described by the following formula : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the interatomic distance .",
    "@xmath9 is the projection of the distance within the graphene plane , i.e the relative shearing displacement .",

    "the vertical axis is the variation of the potential energy per atom relative to the global energy minimum . from the top panel , at different interlayer space , the energy variation from the lj potential has some difference from that of the rd potential , but they are on the same order . for the registry - related shearing of the two layers ( bottom panel ) ,",
    "the energy variation from the lj potential is one order smaller than that from the rd potential .",
    "inset shows the structure of the bilayer graphene at the local energy maximum point @xmath23   .",
    "this comparison indicates that the lj potential can provide a good description for those phenomena , where the registry effect is not important .",
    "however , the lj potential gives underestimate prediction for those phenomena with important registry effect .",
    "in other words , both lj and rd potentials give similar interlayer breathing mode in the flg , but they provide very different prediction for the interlayer shear mode .",

    "the right top inset shows the two - dimensional temperature distribution , where atoms are colored according to their temperature .",
    "the temperature gradient is obtained by linear fitting for the central 50% areas ( left bottom inset ) .",
    "the lj and rd potentials yield almost the same temperature gradient in this case .",
    "once the temperature gradient ( @xmath24 ) is obtained , the thermal conductivity is then calculated from the fourier law @xmath25 .",
    "we calculate the thermal conductivity in flg , where the interlayer interaction is described by either the lj or the rd potential .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rdp_lj ] that the energy related to the interlayer breathing movement from these two potentials is close to each other , while the energy related to the interlayer shearing movement in the flg is quite different from lj or rd potential . as a result ,",
    "the thermal conductivity in flg from these two potentials will be similar if the interlayer breathing mode makes dominant contribution to the thermal conductivity ; i.e the lj and rd potentials result in similar thermal conductivity if the registry effect is not important .",
    "otherwise , quite different thermal conductivity should be obtained from the lj and rd potentials , if the interlayer shear mode is dominates heat transport and the registry effect is important .    figure .",
    "[ fig_kappa_temperature ] shows the temperature dependence for the thermal conductivity from the lj or rd potential .",
    "three systems of different size are compared @xmath26  nm , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "similar as previous works,@xcite the thermal conductivity in bilayer graphene is less than that in the single layer graphene . for system with dimension @xmath29 ,",
    "the thermal conductivity is reduced by 11% with layer number increasing from 1 to 2 .",
    "this is much smaller than the value of about 30% in the experiment.@xcite it is probably due to the size effect .",
    "the dimension of the experiment sample is on the order of micrometer .",
    "the number of the phonon - phonon scattering channel increases owning to the increased number of phonon branches in thicker flg .",
    "this increased scattering channel directly leads to an increasing scattering rate in large samples , because there are sufficient phonon modes for the occurrence of most of the phonon - phonon scatterings . as a result , a stronger reduction in the thermal conductivity is observed in the experiment with increasing thickness .",
    "however , the system size is on the nanometer level in md simulations , so the phonon modes are not sufficient . in this situation ,",
    "the phonon - phonon scattering rate only slightly increases , although the number of the scattering channel is much greater in thicker flg . as a result ,",
    "the reduction of the thermal conductivity with increasing thickness is smaller than the experiment value .",
    "we have also calculated the thermal conductivity for a longer graphene nanoribbon of dimension @xmath30 .",
    "the thermal conductivity reduction in bilayer graphene is still around 10% .",
    "the md simulation becomes expensive for graphene with further increasing size ; while the other approaches ( eg . boltzmann method ) may be more suitable .",
    "due to similar size effect , the thermal conductivity increases almost linearly with increasing length .",
    "the thermal conductivity in system of dimension @xmath28 is almost double of that in the system of dimension @xmath29 . for more discussions on the size effect on the thermal conductivity in nanostructures",
    ", we refer to ref .  .",
    "let s compare the thermal conductivity from lj and rd potentials .",
    "it is quite obvious that there is only small difference between the thermal conductivity from these two potentials . especially for the system @xmath28 , the thermal conductivity from these two potentials are almost the same in the whole simulation temperature range",
    "hence , our first observation indicates that the registry effect is actually not important for the thermal conductivity in bilayer graphene .",
    "in other word , our results provide an evidence that the interlayer breathing mode plays a more important role on the thermal conductivity than the interlayer shear mode .",
    "this can be further validated by fig .",
    "[ fig_md_energy ] . in the figure ,",
    "the lj and rd potential energies are compared during the whole md simulation in bilayer graphene of dimension @xmath22  nm at 300  k. the energy is with reference to the value at equilibrium configuration .",
    "it is obvious that the rd potential energy is higher than the lj potential , but they are on the same order .",
    "this indicates that the interlayer breathing mode is the major movement during the md simulation .",
    "that is why the registry effect is not important .",
    "if the interlayer shear mode has major contribution , then the lj and rd potentials shown in the figure should be very different from each other .",
    "[ fig_kappa_nl ] shows the thermal conductivity v.s layer number in the flg of dimension @xmath29 at 300  k and 1200  k. first of all , similar thermal conductivity from either lj or rd potential is obtained .",

    "the thermal conductivity at 1200  k is almost the same within erors in all flg with different layer number . at 300  k",
    ", there is a distinct reduction in the thermal conductivity when the layer number increases from 1 to 2 .",
    "this is consistent with the observations in the experiment , where the reduction of the thermal conductivity mostly happens between single layer graphene and bilayer graphene.@xcite for layer number above 2 , the thermal conductivity is almost the same , which agrees with the recent experiment by jang et.al.@xcite in the experiment , the thinner ( 2- , 3- , 4-layer ) graphene samples did not show any clear thickness dependence .",
