    "a very convenient platform to investigate chiral symmetry breaking is the non - perturbative approach provided by the schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) .",

    "this problem was studied in refs .  @xcite . after projecting the photons onto ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , a non - local term emerges in the maxwell lagrangian , leading to the so - called pseudo quantum electrodynamics ( pqed ) @xcite , sometimes also referred to as reduced quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that pqed correctly describes the physical 1/r coulomb interaction between static charges , contrarily to qed3 at tree level , which provides a logarithmic static interaction @xmath4 .",

    "we also include two appendices , in the first one we compare our analytical results to the numerical solution of the full integral equation for the mass function , while in the second one , we discuss the approach about the wave function renormalization .",

    "in addition , this analytical approach for qed4 has been also confirmed by a numerical solution of the full schwinger - dyson equation for the mass function @xcite .",
