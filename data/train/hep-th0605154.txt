    "we present a new @xmath0(1 ) gauge symmetry `` of the third kind '' , related to local gauge transformations in the space of field configurations underlying quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "while results are summarized here , more details may be found in ref .  .",
    "point of departure is the observation that the reduction of the potentiality described by the wave function(al ) @xmath1 to the actuality of the outcome of a measurement process has been left outside of quantum theory ( in its standard form ) : + _ `` ... , it is an incomplete representation of real things , although it is the only one which can be built out of the fundamental concepts of force and material points ( quantum corrections to classical mechanics ) .",
    "the incompleteness of the representation leads necessarily to the statistical nature ( incompleteness ) of the laws . '' _",
    "@xcite + in other words , aspects of the theory that concern the concept of information have hitherto been left separate from the concepts of force and material points , the `` real things '' einstein refers to .",
    "correspondingly , this is reflected in the remarkable derivation of the kinematical setting of quantum theory from three information theoretical constraints , as discussed , for example , in the recent review by bub :  @xcite the `` real things '' do not play a role in it .",
    "the cut between `` real things '' and `` information about real things '' appears to be due to historical contingencies , not unlike the cut between dynamical theories , describing the effects of gravity in particular , and geometrical theories of space and time , until their fusion in general relativity .    in this note",
    ", we propose to reconsider the role of the wave functional .",
    "we assume that its phase is not only subject to global gauge transformations ( `` of the first kind '' ) and local ones ( `` of the second kind '' ) , related to the common field variables of qft : there are also functional gauge transformations which are _ local in the space of field configurations _ and which attribute a physical ` charge ' to @xmath1 .",
    "we recall that local u(1 ) gauge invariance of the schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics ( `` first quantization '' ) is related to the electromagnetic interaction via the classical minimal coupling prescription .",
    "two important aspects should be noted :  @xcite ( * a * ) the quantum mechanical model of a charged particle interacting with the electromagnetic field descends from maxwell s theory , via minimally coupled classical particle hamiltonian , through its quantization , finally to the gauge invariant schrdinger equation .",
    "thus , there is a _ classical _ regime where the quantum theory is anchored ( copenhagen interpretation ) . ",
    "( * b * ) the schrdinger equation can be also interpreted as nonrelativistic limit of the klein - gordon equation . however , the latter is not acceptable as a quantum mechanical single - particle wave equation , since there are negative energy states and a ` probability ' density which is not positive definite .",
    "instead , with minimal coupling , the klein - gordon equation describes _ interacting classical _ ( ! ) _ scalar and electromagnetic fields_.    an analogous dynamical scheme exists for the functional schrdinger equation ( `` second quantization '' ) , as we shall see .",
    "it predicts the universal coupling of _ all _ fields that are variables in this equation and introduces a fundamental length .    guided by our new gauge principle , we couple a dynamical functional @xmath2 to the wave functional @xmath1 , generalizing the action of dirac s variational principle . here , the would - be - quantum sector described by @xmath1 forms a dissipative subsystem of the enlarged structure , effectively extending it nonlinearly and nonlocally in the space of field configurations .",
    " nonlinear extensions of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics have been studied earlier by bialynicki - birula and mycielski  @xcite and by weinberg  @xcite .",
    "works of kibble  @xcite and of kibble and randjbar - daemi  @xcite present nonlinear extensions of scalar qft models where parameters of the models are quantum state dependent .",
    "however , this kind of nonlinearity is not compatible with our gauge principle , which dictates a different form of _ nonlinearity _ ( in @xmath1 ) of the wave functional equation .",
    "as we shall see , quantum theory is embedded here into a new framework , where the potentiality represented by @xmath1 bears the character of a charge .",
    "it causes correlations of the underlying fields beyond what is encoded in their usual lagrangians , with qft describing an infrared limit .",
    "we speculate that a model of this kind might point in the right direction towards unifying the concepts of `` real things '' and `` information about real things '' .    in distinction to other proposals that have",
    "quantum mechanics emerge from underlying dynamics  @xcite , our approach does not depend on a particular field theory , such as the standard model , or otherwise special dynamics .",
    "we share , however , the tentative conclusion that quantum theory can and should be reconstructed as an effective theory describing large - scale behavior of _ fundamentally deterministic degrees of freedom_. quantum states are no longer the primary degrees of freedom .",
    "bell s theorem and the predicament of local hidden variable theories are circumvented , since the implied nonlocality operates at the pre - quantum level .",
    "the functional schrdinger picture of qft is convenient for our argument .",
    "references to related work are given in ref .  .",
    " we consider a generic scalar field theory , for simplicity , and refer to ref .   concerning systems with internal gauge symmetries .",
    "the functional schrdinger equation is : @xmath3=h[\\hat\\pi , \\varphi]\\psi [ \\varphi ; t]\\equiv \\int\\mbox{d}^3x\\big\\ { -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta^2}{\\delta\\varphi^2 } + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\varphi ) ^2+v(\\varphi ) \\big\\}\\psi [ \\varphi ; t ] \\;\\;,\\ ] ] with the hamiltonian @xmath4 corresponding to the classical hamiltonian density ; mass and selfinteraction terms are included in @xmath5 . here",
    ", the classical canonical momentum conjugate to the field ( coordinate ) @xmath6 is substituted by : @xmath7 which implements the field quantization ( coordinate representation ) .    in analogy to gauge transformations in the first quantized schrdinger picture",
    ", we now define @xmath0(1 ) _ gauge transformations of the third kind _ by : @xmath8\\equiv\\exp ( -i\\lambda [ \\varphi ; t])\\psi [ \\varphi ; t ] \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 denotes a time dependent real functional .",
    "such gauge transformations are local in the space of field configurations .",
    "they differ from the usual gauge transformations in qft .",
    " in fact , the wave equation ( [ fsscalar ] ) becomes invariant under transformation ( [ localfuncgt ] ) , if new covariant derivatives are introduced : @xmath10 \\;\\ ; , \\\\",

    "generally , @xmath2 depends on @xmath11 ; it is a _",
    "functional _ of @xmath6 in eq.([dtcov ] ) , while it is a _ functional field _ in eq.([dxcov ] ) . distinguishing these components of @xmath2 by subscripts",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , we may also define an invariant ` field strength ' : @xmath13\\equiv   \\partial_t{\\cal a}_\\varphi [ \\varphi ; t,\\vec x ] -\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\varphi ( \\vec x ) } { \\cal a}_t[\\varphi ; t ] \\;\\;,\\ ] ] i.e. , @xmath14/i$ ] .    in order to give further meaning to the coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ", we have to postulate a consistent dynamics for the latter .",
    "all elementary fields supposedly are present as the coordinates on which the wave functional depends  presently just a scalar field , besides time .",
    "we assume the following @xmath0(1 ) invariant action : @xmath15\\big ) \\psi",
    "-\\frac{l^2}{2}\\int\\mbox{d}^3x\\;\\big ( { \\cal f}_{t\\varphi } \\big ) ^2\\big\\ } \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , and with a dimensionless real function @xmath17 depending on the density : @xmath18\\equiv\\psi^*[\\varphi ; t]\\psi [ \\varphi ; t ] \\;\\;.\\ ] ] we shall see shortly that @xmath17 incorporates a necessary _ nonlinearity_. the fundamental parameter @xmath19 has dimension @xmath20=[length]$ ] , for dimensionless measure @xmath21 and @xmath1 .",
    "our action generalizes the action for a schrdinger wave functional which has been employed for applications of dirac s variational principle to qft before .",
    "@xcite it depends on @xmath22 , and @xmath23 separately .",
    " varying @xmath24 with respect to @xmath25 ( and @xmath1 ) yields the gauge invariant @xmath1-functional equation of motion ( and its adjoint ) : @xmath26 = h[\\frac{1}{i}{\\cal d}_{\\varphi},\\varphi ] \\psi [ \\varphi ; t ] \\;\\;,\\ ] ] replacing eq.([fsscalar ] ) ; here @xmath27 .",
    "varying with respect to @xmath23 , we obtain : @xmath28 = \\frac{1}{2il^2}\\left (   \\psi^*[\\varphi;t]{\\cal d}_{\\varphi ( \\vec x)}\\psi [ \\varphi;t ] -\\psi [ \\varphi;t]({\\cal d}_{\\varphi ( \\vec x)}\\psi [ \\varphi;t])^ * \\right ) \\;\\;.\\ ] ] this invariant ` gauge field equation ' completes the set of dynamical equations .",
    "the nonlinear eq.([ginvfsscalar ] ) preserves the normalization , i.e. @xmath29 is conserved , while the overlap of two different states , @xmath30 , generally varies in time .",
    "this seems to hint at a probability interpretation , yet the continuity equation , eq.([continuity ] ) below , shows that this can not be maintained . for @xmath31 , also the _ homogeneity property _ does no longer hold , i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) present two different physical states  @xcite .",
    "this changes essential aspects of the measurement theory  @xcite and indicates that here qft is embedded in a _ classical _ framework .",
    " furthermore , the hamiltonian @xmath4 , unlike in qft , can not be arbitrarily shifted by a constant @xmath34 , transforming @xmath35 .",
    " finally , our action is invariant under space - time translations and spatial rotations .",
    "elsewhere , we will present @xmath24 in a manifestly lorentz invariant form , given a suitable background spacetime .",
    "variation of @xmath24 with respect to @xmath36 , which is a lagrange multiplier , yields the corresponding gauge invariant ` gauss ' law : @xmath37 = \\frac{1}{l^2}\\psi^*[\\varphi ; t]\\psi [ \\varphi ; t]{\\cal n}(\\rho ) \\;\\;.\\ ] ] this can be combined with eq.([fieldeq ] ) to result in the continuity equation : @xmath38 expressing local @xmath0(1 ) ` charge ' conservation in the space of field configurations .  the eq.([continuity ] ) implies that the total ` charge ' @xmath39 has to vanish at all times:@xcite @xmath40 here , the necessity of the nonlinearity becomes obvious . without it , the vanishing total ` charge ' could not be implemented .",
    "besides necessarily multiplying the invariant term @xmath41 in @xmath24 , the nonlinearity is not yet determined . a particular choice related to an entropy",
    "functional has been studied in ref .  .",
    "in this case , one finds that the ` charge ' density @xmath42 is the deviation of entropy density per unit area from a reference density @xmath43 .",
    "thus , also the _ entropy / area _",
    "@xmath44 is a parameter , besides the fundamental _ length _ @xmath19 .",
    "( entropy per area is an essential parameter in apparently unrelated work of padmanabhan  @xcite , suggesting that gravity is intrinsically holographic and quantum mechanical . ) in any case , the timescale of the @xmath1-functional evolution shrinks or expands in different regions of configuration space , depending on the factor @xmath45 in eq.([ginvfsscalar ] ) .",
    "two remarks are in order here : ( * a * ) the eqs.([ginvfsscalar])([gauss ] ) obey a _ weak superposition principle _",
    "@xcite : the sum of two solutions , @xmath46 , that do not overlap , presents also a solution , provided that @xmath47 is determined consistently .  ( * b * ) as we argued in ref .",
    ", our nonlinear extension of qft is _ local _ in the usual sense ( _ microcausality_).@xcite  however , suppose we integrated out the ` gauge field ' . the resulting effective equation for @xmath1 would be _ nonlocal in field space and in space - time_.",
    "we study the separation of the time dependence in eqs.([ginvfsscalar])([gauss ] ) with the ansatz @xmath48\\equiv\\mbox{exp}(-i\\omega t)\\psi_\\omega [ \\varphi ] $ ] , @xmath49 , and consistently assuming _ time independent _ @xmath2-functionals .",
    "thus , the eq.([ginvfsscalar ] ) yields : @xmath50\\big ) \\psi_\\omega [ \\varphi ] = h[\\frac{1}{i}{\\cal d}_{\\varphi},\\varphi ] \\psi_\\omega [ \\varphi ] \\;\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath51 and @xmath52\\psi_\\omega [ \\varphi ] $ ] . from eq.([fieldeq ] ) follows : @xmath53{\\cal d}_{\\varphi ( \\vec x)}\\psi_\\omega [ \\varphi ] -\\psi_\\omega [ \\varphi ] ( { \\cal d}_{\\varphi ( \\vec x)}\\psi_\\omega [ \\varphi ] ) ^ * \\right ) = 0 \\;\\;,\\ ] ] which expresses the vanishing of the ` current ' in the stationary situation .",
    " applying a time independent gauge transformation , cf .",
    "eqs.([localfuncgt ] ) , ( [ afunctiongt ] ) , the stationary wave functional can be made _",
    "real_. the eq.([fieldeq0 ] ) then implies @xmath54 ; consequently , @xmath55 everywhere . finally , `",
    "gauss ' law , eq.([gauss ] ) , determines @xmath36 : @xmath56 = \\frac{1}{l^2}\\rho_\\omega { \\cal n}(\\rho_\\omega ) \\;\\;,\\ ] ] which has to be solved selfconsistently together with eq.([psizeroeq ] ) .",
    " separation of the time dependence thus leads to two coupled equations .",
    "one may guess an appropriate time independent @xmath57-functional .",
    "having an action at hand , eq.([action ] ) , the parameters of such an ansatz can be optimized by the variational principle , in analogy to hartree approximation and semiclassical limit of qft . furthermore ,",
    "the eq.([gauss0 ] ) can be solved formally by functional fourier transformation , eliminating @xmath36 at the expense of introducing the nonlocality mentioned before .    turning to _ separability",
    "_ , this is an important property of linear quantum theory .",
    "it allows to combine subsystems which do not interact with each other , without creating unphysical correlations  @xcite .",
    "this should be preserved to the extent that is verified experimentally .",
    " we have argued that linear _",
    "qft arises in the infrared ( ir ) limit _ , and consequently separability :  @xcite assume that the system is in a _ diffuse state _",
    ", characterized by a density @xmath58 that is widely spread over the space of configurations of @xmath6 .",
    "for such a high entropy state , the local energy density and the ` charge density ' on the right - hand side of eq.([gauss0 ] ) must be small . for our particular choice of nonlinearity , then , the stationary functional schrdinger equation results , @xmath59 , and with it the known structures of qft .  consequences of small violations of this linear equation , related to terms involving @xmath58 or @xmath36 , should be explored .",
    "nonlinear effects become important in our framework only for states with a small uncertainty in configuration space , such that the ir limit does not apply .",
    "finally , we remark that two stationary solutions , @xmath60 , of the present eigenvalue problem , in general , obey a generalized _ orthogonality _ relation that reduces to the usual one of qft in the ir limit .",
    "new gauge transformations `` of the third kind '' attribute a @xmath0(1 ) ` charge ' to the wave functional , which leads to an embedding of quantum field theory in a larger nonlinear structure . ",
    "it differs from earlier proposals of nonlinear generalizations of quantum mechanics or qft  @xcite .",
    "we tentatively interpret it as a classical one , since differently charged components of the wave functional @xmath1 , besides being governed by the usual interactions of an underlying field theory model ( such as gauge theories , see ref .  ) , are coupled through a new connection functional @xmath2 .",
    "when effects of the latter are negligible , qft is recovered .",
    "a number of interesting problems need further study , before this proposal can stand on its own .",
    " a theory of the observables and the measurement process needs to be worked out .",
    "it is promising that the energy - momentum tensor following from our action , eq.([action ] ) , similarly in the presence of internal gauge symmetries , is the one of the respective qft _ plus _ contributions due to the coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "when the latter is small , the usual observables may be useful , while the coupling might be important for the reduction or collapse of the wave functional . ",
    "a solution in the case of an underlying free field theory should be possible , based on the variational principle , for example . this will be helpful to better understand effects of the new coupling .",
    " reparametrization invariant models are an important target . as compared to a wheeler - dewitt type equation , the presence of additional nonlinear terms in what replaces this equation may actually be useful .",
