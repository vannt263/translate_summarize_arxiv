    "in the early 20th century , it was found that some principal questions could not be resolved by newton s theory .",
    "one of the most notable problems was the prediction of mercury orbit s orientation . according to these deficits , in 1915",
    "einstein published a tensorial theory of gravitation which is known as general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "gr theory has been accepted as a principal method to define geometrical characteristics of space - time .",
    "black holes and existence of gravitational waves are the most considerable anticipations of gr theory .",
    "recent observations of gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger in ligo and virgo collaboration provided a firmly evidence of einstein s theory @xcite . in order to have an effective gr theory ,",
    "one really needs the language of geometry .",
    "hence , the approach one prefers is to concentrate on the technique of geometry without taking into account the complicated algebraic significances .",
    "on the other hand , the coupling of nonlinear sources and gr , attracted significant attentions because of their specific properties .",
    "interesting properties of various nonlinear electrodynamics have been studied before by many authors nonlie1,nonlie2,nonlie3,nonlie4,nonlie5,nonlie6,nonlie7,nonlie8 , nonlie9,nonlie10,nonlie11,nonlie13,nonlie14,nonlie15,nonlie16 , nonlie17,nonlie18,nonlie19,nonlie20,nonlie21,nonlie22,nonlie23 , nonlie24 .",
    "one of the special class of the nonlinear electrodynamics sources is power - law maxwell invariant ( pmi ) , which its lagrangian is an arbitrary power of maxwell lagrangian @xcite .",
    "it is notable that , this lagrangian is invariant under the conformal transformation @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are metric tensor and the electromagnetic potential , respectively .",
    "this model is considerably richer than maxwell theory and in a special case ( unit power ) , it reduces to linear maxwell field ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , for more details ) .",
    "the studies on the black object solutions coupled to a pmi field have got a lot of attentions in the past decade blackobj1,blackobj2,blackobj22,blackobj3,blackobj4,blackobj5 .",
    "another attractive feature of the pmi theory is its conformal invariance , when the power of maxwell invariant is a quarter of space - time dimensions ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is related to dimensions of space - time ) . in other words , for the special choice of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is power of pmi ) , one obtains traceless energy - momentum tensor which leads to conformal invariance .",
    "it is notable that the idea is to take advantages of the conformal symmetry to construct the analogues of the @xmath9-dimensional reissner - nordstrm solutions with an inverse square electric field in arbitrary dimensions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , for more details ) .    in recent years",
    ", more attentions are oriented on black hole physics among authors owing to their critical behavior and phase transition .",
    "besides , one may encounter with ads / cft correspondence for investigating anti de - sitter space - time . thermodynamical behavior of black holes in asymptotically anti de - sitter space was studied first by hawking and page @xcite . generally , at the critical point where phase transition occurs , discontinuity / divergency of a state space variable such as heat capacity is observed @xcite .",
    "recently , the consideration of the cosmological constant as a thermodynamical variable , pressure , opened up new avenues in studying black holes .",
    "it was possible to obtain van der waals like behavior and second order phase transition in thermodynamical phase structure of the black holes .",
    "in addition , it was shown that for specific black holes , reentrant of the phase transition and existence of triple point could be observed cosmp1,cosmp2,cosmp3,cosmp4,cosmp5,cosmp6,cosmp7 , cosmp8,cosmp9,cosmp10,cosmp11,cosmp12,cosmp13,cosmp15 , cosmp16,cosmp17,cosmp18,cosmp19 .",
    "the consideration of the cosmological constant as a thermodynamical variable has been supported by studies that are conducted in context of the classical thermodynamics of black holes and gauge / gravity duality @xcite .",
    "one of the methods for obtaining van der waals like critical points , is through the use of the heat capacity with the relation between cosmological constant and pressure @xcite .",
    "this method has been employed in several papers and it was shown that its results are consistent with those obtained through regular methods .",
    "on the other hand , geometrical thermodynamics ( gt ) method was first employed by gibbs and caratheodory .",
    "gt is one of the suitable methods for studying phase transition of black holes . regarding to this method",
    ", one could build the phase space by employing thermodynamical potential and its corresponding extensive parameters .",
    "meanwhile , divergence points of thermodynamical ricci scalar provide information about phase transition point of a system . historically speaking",
    ", first , weinhold introduced a metric on the equilibrium thermodynamical phase space @xcite and after that , it was redefined by ruppeiner from a different point of view @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , there is a conformally relationship between ruppeiner / weinhold metric .",
    "one can obtain that , the conformal factor is inverse of temperature @xcite .",
    "none of weinhold and ruppeiner metrics were invariant under legendre transformation .",
    "the legendre invariance metric was introduced by quevedo quevedoi , quevedoii which can remove some problems of weinhold / ruppeiner methods .",
    "although quevedo can solve some issues of the previous methods , it is confronted with other problems in specific systems .",
    "therefore , in order to remove these problems , a new method was proposed in ref .",
    "hpemi , hpemii , hpemiii , hpemiv which is known as hpem ( hendi - panahiyan - eslam panah - momennia ) metric . in this paper",
    ", we want to study thermal stability and phase transition in the context of gt method and extended phase space for black holes in einstein gravity with a pmi source in higher dimensions .",
    "it is notable that in recent years , phase transition , curvatures , hessian matrix and nambu brackets have been studied via a new gt method mirza1,mirza2,mirza3 which , here , we are not interested to discuss this method .    the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we introduce field equations and black hole solutions in einstein - pmi gravity . next",
    ", the temperature and heat capacity for the obtained black hole solution are investigated and the stability is studied .",
    "then , weinhold , ruppeiner and quevedo metrics for studying geometrical thermodynamics of these black holes are employed .",
    "it will be seen that , these metrics fail to provide fruitful results .",
    "so , we employ the hpem metric and study the phase transition of these black holes in the context of gt .",
    "next , second order critical points are extracted through the use of the proportionality between cosmological constant and pressure .",
    "finally , the paper is finished with some closing remarks .",
    "the action of @xmath5-dimensional einstein gravity in the presence of power - law maxwell field with negative cosmological constant can be written as @xmath10 ,   \\label{eaction}\\]]where @xmath11 is the ricci scalar and @xmath12 is constant which determining the nonlinearity power of electromagnetic field .",
    "the maxwell invariant @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the electromagnetic tensor which is equal to @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the gauge potential one - form .",
    "one can obtain field equations by varying action ( [ eaction ] ) with respect to the gravitational and gauge field , @xmath17 and @xmath3 , respectively @xmath18   & = & 0 . \\label{eelectro}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the presence of nonlinear power - law maxwell invariant field , one can show that the energy - momentum tensor becomes @xmath19 ,   \\label{energy}\\]]and for the case of @xmath20 eqs .",
    "( [ efield])-([energy ] ) reduce to well - known einstein - maxwell theory @xcite .",
    "we apply the following static metric of @xmath5-dimensional space - time @xmath21where @xmath22 is an arbitrary function of radial coordinate which should be determined , and @xmath23 is the line element of @xmath24-dimensional hypersurface with volume @xmath25 which has constant curvature @xmath26 @xmath27 & k=-1 \\\\ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}d\\phi _ { i}^{2 } & k=0% \\end{array}% \\right .   \\label{metrick}\\ ] ]    constant @xmath28 indicates that the boundary of @xmath29 and @xmath30 would be a positive ( spherical ) , negative ( hyperbolic ) and zero ( flat ) constant curvature hypersurface .",
    "since we are going to obtain the electrically charged solutions , we consider the consistent gauge potential one - form as @xmath31 . by considering this radial gauge potential , we find that the maxwell invariant will be @xmath32 , and therefore ,",
    "regardless of the values of nonlinearity parameter ( @xmath12 ) , the solutions are well - defined .",
    "now , taking into account the mentioed gauge potential with eqs .",
    "( [ efield ] ) and ( [ eelectro ] ) , one can obtain metric function and electromagnetic field in following forms @xcite @xmath33@xmath34where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are integration constants which are related to electric charge ( @xmath37 ) and the adm mass ( @xmath38 ) of the black hole in the following manner @xmath39@xmath40    by using the area law , black hole entropy could be determined as @xmath41and also we can obtain the hawking temperature of the black hole on the outer horizon by using surface gravity interpretation @xmath42where @xmath43 is the killing vector of the event horizon .",
    "also , the black hole electric potential ( @xmath44 ) , could be measured at infinity with respect to the event horizon @xmath45 @xmath46    it is straightforward to show that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath47    the case where @xmath48 is known as conformally invariant maxwell ( cim ) . through the paper , we will divide the solutions to the cases of cim ( where @xmath48 ) and pmi ( @xmath49 ) solutions . in the following , by using geometrical thermodynamics approach , we want to study black hole s phase transitions .",
    "in case of pmi , it is evident that signature of the temperature depends on choices of different parameters . here , for the ads spherical case , topological and @xmath50 terms are contributing to positivity of the temperature .",
    "interestingly for charge term , depending on choices of nonlinearity parameter , @xmath12 , this term may contribute to negativity or positivity of temperature .",
    "if the condition @xmath51is satisfied , charge term will always have negative effect on temperature while for violation of this condition , it will have positive contribution .",
    "it is crucial to mention that this dual behavior is due to contribution of the generalization to nonlinear electromagnetic field . in other words , by setting @xmath20 , the charge term will only have negative effect on temperature ( contribution to positivity does not exist ) .",
    "this highlights the effects of nonlinear electromagnetic field on thermodynamical structure of the black holes .",
    "that being said , one can point out that for violation of the mentioned condition , for spherical ads black holes , temperature is positive without any root .    for small values of horizon radius ,",
    "the dominant term is charge term while for large values of the horizon radius , @xmath50 term will be dominant . for spherical ads space - time with the condition being satisfied",
    ", @xmath50 term is positive .",
    "therefore , for large values of horizon radius , temperature will be positive .",
    "therefore , there exists a root for temperature , @xmath52 , in which for @xmath53 , temperature is negative and solutions are not physical .    on the contrary , due to negative contribution of the @xmath50 in spherical ds space - time , the temperature will be negative for large values of horizon radius .",
    "the effective term here is topological term . in other words , by suitable choices of different parameters , for a region of horizon radius , topological term would be dominant which results into formation of an extremum ( maximum ) and existence of two roots . between these two roots , temperature is positive and solutions are physical ( otherwise , temperature is negative ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that for hyperbolic horizon , the temperature will be always negative in this case .",
    "therefore , for this case physical solutions do not exist .",
    "now , we focus on effects of each parameter on negativity / positivity of the temperature . evidently , by increasing dimensions ,",
    "the effect of topological and charge terms increase while the opposite takes place for @xmath50 . as for nonlinearity parameter , for @xmath54 , if @xmath55 , then the effects of charge term is an increasing function of @xmath12 , while if @xmath56 , the effects of charge term will be a decreasing function of @xmath12 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that for @xmath57 for both cases of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the charge term is a decreasing function of the nonlinearity parameter .",
    "we should point it out that we have excluded @xmath20 , since it is maxwell case .",
    "in addition , the effect of charge term is an increasing function of the electric charge .",
    "now , by considering mentioned effects , one is able to determine the thermodynamical behavior of these black holes in the context of temperature and study different limits which these black holes have .      in the cim case , contribution of the charged term is always toward negativity of the temperature .",
    "the dominant term for small values of horizon radius , is charge term which is negative . for medium and large values of horizon radius , the dominant terms ,",
    "respectively , are topological and @xmath58 terms . considering the dominance of different terms , depending on choices of topology and type of space - time , temperature could be one of the following cases :    \\i ) for ds space - time and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , all the terms in temperature are negative . therefore , temperature will be negative and solutions are not physical .",
    "\\ii ) for ds space - time and @xmath61 , only topological term is positive whereas charge and @xmath50 are negative . remembering that for small and large black holes , the dominant term are @xmath35 and @xmath50 terms , it is possible to find two roots for temperature and one maximum which is located at the positive values of temperature .",
    "this leads to presence of physical solutions only for medium black holes while for large and small black holes physical black holes are absence .",
    "\\iii ) for ads space - time , the @xmath50 term has positive contribution . remembering that for small and large black holes , dominant term are charge and @xmath50 terms , respectively , irrespective of topological structure of the black holes",
    ", there exists a root for the temperature . for black holes smaller than this root ,",
    "temperature is negative and solutions are non - physical .",
    "for @xmath59 , @xmath60 in this case , the temperature is only an increasing function of the horizon radius . whereas , by suitable choices of different parameters , in case of @xmath61 , temperature may acquire one or two extrema .",
    "the behavior of temperature in this case is similar to @xmath62 diagrams in extended phase space ( similar ones in van der waals like black holes ) , which indicates that a second order phase transition takes place for these black holes .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that exrema in temperature are matched with divergencies in heat capacity which results into the existence of second order phase transition in thermodynamical structure of the black holes .",
    "next , we study the stability conditions of these black holes . to do so",
    ", we employ the canonical ensemble which is based on heat capacity .",
    "the stability conditions are determined by the behavior of the heat capacity .",
    "in other words , the sign of heat capacity represents thermal stability / instability of the system .",
    "the positivity indicates that system under consideration is in thermally stable state .",
    "in addition , there are two types of points which could be extracted by using the heat capacity : bound and phase transition points .",
    "the bound point is where the heat capacity ( temperature ) acquires a root .",
    "the reason for calling it as bound point comes from the fact that it is where the sign of temperature is changed . since the negative temperature is representing a non - physical solution , this point marks a bound point . on the other hand ,",
    "phase transition point is where a discontinuity exists for heat capacity .",
    "in other words , heat capacity meets a divergency .",
    "the heat capacity is given by @xmath63where by employing eqs .",

    "therefore , we employ numerical approach to study stability and obtain bound and phase transition points of these black holes .",
    "the results of the numerical evaluation is presented in following diagrams ( figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig3 ] ) .",

    "this is the bound point . for @xmath53 (",
    "@xmath52 is the root ) , solutions have negative temperature and heat capacity .",
    "therefore , in this region , solutions are non - physical ones .",
    "for small values of electric charge , the temperature will have two extrema . in places of these extrema , heat capacity is divergent ( left and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in other words , in places of these extrema , system goes under second order phase transitions . by increasing electric charge ,",
    "these extrema are vanished and only a bound point will remain ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . as for nonlinearity parameter ,",
    "its effects are opposite of those of electric charge . in other words , by increasing nonlinearity parameter , the extrema for temperature and divergencies for heat capacity are formed ( middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) while for small values of this parameter , only bound point is observed ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the effects of dimensionality are similar to those observed for nonlinearity parameter . meaning that by increasing dimensionality , two extrema are formed and system will acquire second order phase transitions in its phase space in higher dimensions ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "as for stability , if only bound point is observed , physical stable solutions is observed only for @xmath75 .",
    "the formation of extrema modifies the stability conditions of these black holes highly . in this case ,",
    "bound point and two divergencies of the heat capacity determine stable regions and phase transitions .",
    "between bound point and smaller divergence point , both temperature and heat capacity are positive .",
    "therefore , in this region solutions are physical and stable . on the other hand , between two divergencies ,",
    "temperature is positive while heat capacity is negative , which leads to solutions being physical and unstable . finally after larger divergency , both heat capacity and temperature are positive and solutions are stable .",
    "thermodynamical concepts indicate that system in unstable state goes under phase transition and acquires stability . by taking this matter into account",
    ", in smaller divergency a phase transition of larger to smaller takes place while vice versa happens in larger divergency .",
    "first , lets study the conditions for the positivity / negativity of the solutions . in order to have positive heat capacity",
    ", it needs to satisfy @xmath76 in which@xmath77    it is not possible to obtain roots and divergencies of the heat capacity for this case , analytically .",
    "therefore , we employ numerical methods and plot following diagrams for studying the effects of different parameters ( figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it is evident that for small values of electric charge , the temperature has one root with two extrema .",
    "the root of the temperature and heat capacity coincide with each other while the extrema of the temperature are matched with divergencies in heat capacity .",
    "these divergencies are phase transition points .",
    "increasing the electric charge leads to elimination of phase transition points while there exists a root for temperature and heat capacity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for more details ) .",
    "the opposite behavior is observed for the effects of dimensionality . meaning that by increasing dimensionality , system with one bound point , acquires one root and two divergencies . in other words , by increasing dimensions , the thermodynamical structure of the black holes is modified and black holes will enjoy second order phase transition in their phase diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .      here",
    ", we will employ geometrical thermodynamics to study bound and phase transition points of these black holes .",
    "the geometrical thermodynamics is based on constructing phase space by using one of the thermodynamical quantities as thermodynamical potential .",
    "the information regarding bound and phase transition points are stored in ricci scalar of this phase space . in other words , the divergencies of this ricci scalar present bound and",
    "phase transition points .",
    "depending on choice of thermodynamical potential , the components of phase space differ ( this is due to fact that each thermodynamical quantity has its specific extensive parameters ) .",
    "there are several well known methods for constructing phase space ; weinhold weinholdi , weinholdii , ruppeiner @xcite , quevedo @xcite and hpem @xcite .",
    "the successful method has divergencies which exactly are matched with bound and phase transition points . in a case",
    "where one of the mentioned points are not matched with divergencies of the ricci scalar or an extra divergency exists , this will lead to ensemble dependency .",
    "in other words , by using two different methods for studying same system , two different results are obtained which contradicts with principles of thermodynamics .",
    "the thermodynamical principles state that the results obtained for studying a thermodynamical system must be consistent for all ensembles .",
    "the metrics for mentioned methods are given by @xmath78 in which @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the denominators of their ricci scalars will be @xcite @xmath81    existence of @xmath82 and @xmath83 in denominator of the hpem metric ensures that bound and phase transition points are matched with divergencies of the ricci scalar without any extra divergency .",
    "as for quevedo metric , since @xmath84 is present in denominator of this metric , phase transition points are matched with divergencies of the ricci scalar .",
    "on the other hand , the bound points are matched only when @xmath85which in general is not satisfied .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of @xmath86 may lead to existence of extra divergencies which are not matched with bound and phase transition points .",
    "such a case has been reported for several black holes before @xcite .",
    "analytical evaluation shows that @xmath87 for these black holes will not lead to any extra divergency , but @xmath88 is not satisfied .",
    "therefore , in conclusion , using this geometrical method will lead to ensemble dependency .    in case of weinhold and ruppeiner , it was not analytically possible to see whether divergencies of ricci scalars of these methods coincide completely with bound and phase transition points . therefore , we employed numerical methods and plotted some diagrams ( see fig .",
    "[ fig111 ] ) .    evidently ,",
    "employing weinhold and quevedo metrics will lead to inconsistent results regarding bound and phase transition points . in other words , by taking a closer look at the plotted diagrams ( see fig .",
    "[ fig111 ] ) , it is obvious that there is a mismatch between divergencies of ricci scalar of weinhold metric and bound and phase transition points . in addition , the quevedo metrics fails to produce divergency in its ricci scalar which is coincidence with bound point .",
    "therefore , employing these metrics leads to the cases of ensemble dependency . on the contrary , the divergencies of the ricci scalar of the hpem metric",
    "coincide with bound and phase transition points completely ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig5 ] ) .",
    "one of the interesting properties of the hpem metric is the behavior of its ricci scalar around bound and phase transition points .",
    "if the divergency is related to the phase transition of larger to smaller black holes , the signature of the ricci scalar around it , is positive . on the contrary , for phase transition of smaller to larger black holes",
    ", the sign of ricci scalar around this divergence point is negative . as for the bound point ,",
    "interestingly , the signature of the ricci scalar changes around this divergence point .",
    "these changes in the signature of the ricci scalar enable one to recognize the type of points without prior knowledge about heat capacity .",
    "as for ruppeiner , since it has conformal relation with weinhold metric , same results are applicable for phase transition points .",
    "but , due to existence of temperature in denominator of the ricci scalar of ruppeiner , the bound points are matched with some of the divergencies .",
    "to summarize , we saw that employing weinhold , ruppeiner and quevedo metrics , leads to cases of ensemble dependency while the hpem metric provides suitable number of divergencies in places of bound and phase transition points .",
    "furthermore , the characteristic behavior of ricci scalar of hpem metric enables one to recognize the type of point and phase transition .      in this section",
    ", we will conduct a study regarding possible existence of critical and van der waals like behavior for the solutions .",
    "recently , there has been a novel interpretation for cosmological constant in ads black holes . instead of considering this parameter as a fixed one",

    "the proportionality between cosmological constant and pressure is given by @xmath89    now , by using heat capacity ( [ heat ] ) with ( [ pp ] ) and solving the denominator of the heat capacity with respect to thermodynamical pressure , one obtains following relation for pressure @xmath90 \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array } & \\begin{array}{c } s=\\frac{n}{2 } \\\\",

    "it is evident that for ricci - flat horizon ( @xmath59 ) , there is no positive critical pressure , whereas for @xmath95 , one can obtain a real positive critical pressure when @xmath96 . in the case of spherical horizon ( @xmath61 ) , the sign of @xmath97 is depending on the values of nonlinearity , dimensionality and electric charge .",
    "one may find that for sufficiently large values of @xmath35 , @xmath12 and @xmath98 , the second term will be less than one and one can obtain positive critical pressure , while for usual values of the mentioned parameter , @xmath97 can be negative and one concludes there is no critical behavior . in order to show the effects of different parameters on the critical behavior of the system",

    ", one can see that both critical horizon radius and pressure are increasing functions of this parameter ( left panel of fig .",

    "the effects of nonlinearity parameter should be separated into two branches ; for @xmath107 critical pressure is a decreasing function of @xmath108 while the corresponding critical horizon is an increasing function of it ( left panel of fig .",

    "these opposite behaviors for these two branches , highlight the differences of this nonlinear electromagnetic field with born - infeld like in which the effects of nonlinearity parameter are fixed .    as for cim case , evidently , critical temperature and pressure are decreasing functions of the electric charge , while the critical horizon radius is an increasing function of it ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the effects of dimensionality is opposite of the variation of the electric charge .",

    ", we will investigate some van der waals like properties of the solutions in the extended phase space .",
    "the presence of pressure in thermodynamical quantities and having equation of state at hand , one is able to extract volume expansion coefficient , speed of sound and isothermal compressibility coefficient of these black holes .",
    "the volume expansion coefficient is calculated at constant pressure and it represents changes in volume of the black holes which takes place due to heat transferring .",
    "the volume expansion coefficients for two cases of this paper are given by @xcite @xmath109    the isothermal compressibility coefficient is calculated at constant temperature and it represents the corresponding effects of variation in volume with respect to change in pressure .",
    "here , one can obtain this coefficient as @xcite @xmath110where we have employed @xmath111    the speed of sound in black holes does not carries its usual meaning . here",
    ", while the area of black holes is fixed , the speed of sound indicates a breathing mode for variation of the volume with pressure . for obtaining speed of sound",
    ", one should first calculate the homogenous density which for two cases here , can be written as @xcite @xmath112    now , by employing the method of refs .",
    "@xcite , we obtain @xmath113 in which confirms that speed of sound for these black holes is in the valid region of @xmath114 .",
    "obtained volume expansion and isothermal compressibility coefficients share identical denominator .",
    "therefore , their divergencies are matched .",
    "here , we focus only on the volume expansion coefficient . in order to have a better picture regarding the meaning of divergencies and the sign of this quantity , we have plotted its diagrams with the heat capacity and ricci scalar of hpem metric in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig5 ] ( dashed - dotted lines ) .",
    "first of all , as one can see , the divergencies of the volume expansion coefficient and heat capacity are matched .",
    "this shows that phase transition points that are observed in the heat capacity could be detected by studying divergencies of volume expansion coefficient as well . in other words , the divergencies of the volume expansion coefficient mark points",
    "in which black holes go under second order phase transition . in the absence of divergency for the volume expansion coefficient ,",
    "this quantity is positive valued . on the contrary , when this quantity acquires divergences , its sign changing takes place at divergence points . by taking a closer look at the phase diagrams",
    ", one can see that the regions in which black holes are stable , the volume expansion coefficient is positive valued . on the contrary , in the unstable regions ( negative heat capacity ) ,",
    "the sign of the volume expansion coefficient is negative . here",
    ", we see that the sign of the heat capacity and the volume expansion coefficient are identical in physical regions ( positive ) while in the non - physical region ( negative temperature ) , there is a differences between the sign of these two quantities .",
    "evidently , different approaches toward studying critical behavior of the black holes yield consisting results regarding the number and places of phase transition points .",
    "but , as one can see , each one of the phase diagrams carries specific information regarding thermodynamical structure and properties of the black holes which could not be acquired by other phase diagrams .",
    "therefore , for having a better and more complete picture regrading thermodynamical behaviour / structure / properties of black holes , studying different phase diagrams is necessary and crucial .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated thermodynamical structure of einstein black holes in the presence of pmi nonlinear electromagnetic field through new techniques .",
    "it was shown that the behavior of the temperature and stability conditions for these black holes were functions of different parameters describing the phase structure of these black .",
    "interestingly , it was shown that nonlinearity of the system and its electric charge are two opposing factors in phase structure of these black holes .",
    "this behavior precisely highlights the differences between this theory of nonlinear electromagnetic field and born - infeld like theories . in born - infeld theories ,",
    "the effects of both nonlinearity parameter and electric charge are similar . here",
    ", we see that in pmi theory , these effects are in opposite of each other .",
    "next , geometrical thermodynamics was employed to investigate thermodynamical behavior of these black holes .",
    "it was pointed out that employing the ruppeiner , weinhold and quevedo metrics will lead to anomaly while using hpem metric , one obtains consistent results .",
    "the properties of the hpem metric around bound and phase transition points were highlighted as well .",
    "it was shown that ( un)changing the sign of thermodynamical ricci scalar around divergence points helps one to distinguish bound point from phase transition ones .",
    "in addition , the proportionality between cosmological constant and thermodynamical pressure in denominator of the heat capacity was employed to extract a relation for thermodynamical pressure ( independent of equation of state ) .",
    "using the new pressure relation , it was possible to study the critical behavior of the black hole system . besides , the effects of different parameters on the critical pressure and horizon radius were investigated and it was shown that positivity of critical pressure and horizon radius were subjects to the choices of different parameters . in other words , it was possible to eliminate the existence of second order phase transition in phase space of these black holes by specific choices of different parameter .    finally , we have conducted a study regarding thermodynamical properties of these black holes including volume expansion coefficient , speed of sound and isothermal compressibility coefficient .",
    "we have pointed out that divergencies of the volume expansion coefficient were matched with phase transition points in the heat capacity .",
    "this leads to a coincidence between divergencies of the ricci scalar of hpem and volume expansion coefficient .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the sign of the volume expansion coefficient were same as that of the heat capacity in physical regions ( @xmath115 ) while in the non - physical region ( @xmath116 ) , these two signs were opposite .",
    "the thermodynamical behavior that we observed here is highly depends on choices of the nonlinearity parameter . in specific regions of the nonlinearity parameter",
    ", we observed a series of the effects which were modified in other regions for nonlinearity parameter .",
    "this characteristic behavior is not observed in born - infeld like family of the nonlinear electromagnetic fields .",
    "meaning that the pmi theory not only differs from born - infeld like theories in form , but the characteristic behavior is different and only observed in this theory of the nonlinear electromagnetic field .",
    "these mortifications in thermodynamical behavior of the black holes signal the fact that evolution of the black holes in this theory is different from other charged black holes .",
    "therefore , the trace of these differences may be observable in properties such as quasi normal modes , gravitational waves and hawking radiation and provide interesting case studies in other aspects of physics such as gauge / gravity duality .",
    "we would like to thank m. momennia for the valuable comments .",
    "we also wish to thank shiraz university research council . this work has been supported financially by the research institute for astronomy and astrophysics of maragha , iran ."
