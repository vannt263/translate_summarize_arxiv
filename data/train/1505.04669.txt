    "obviously , the surface breaks the spatial symmetry of the bulk system .",
    "the penetration depth of the effects due to the existence of a bounding surface in the body of the system is set by the correlation length @xmath8 of the order parameter ; @xmath8 becomes large , and theoretically diverges , in the vicinity of the bulk critical point @xmath9 : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the usual critical exponents and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the corresponding nonuniversal amplitudes of the correlation length along the @xmath17 and @xmath0 axes . when at least one of the spacial extensions of the system is finite , as in the @xmath2 film geometry we consider in the current article , one terms the corresponding system a finite system .",
