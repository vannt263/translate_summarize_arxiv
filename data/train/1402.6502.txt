    "the study of effects of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) has been a central theme in condensed matter physics in the past decade .",
    "soc is an essential ingredient in spintronics , which aims to utilize the electron s spin degree of freedom instead of charge for information processing , with the advantages of smaller size , fast speed and low dissipation .",
    "a perhaps more surprising discovery is that soc can give rise to new quantum states of matter , e.g. , topological insulators that are bulk insulators characterized by nontrivial topological invariants and gapless surface ( or edge ) states . in two dimension ( 2d ) ,",
    "a topological insulator with time reversal symmetry is also known as the quantum spin hall ( qsh)insulator.@xcite it has an insulating bulk and gapless spin helical edge states protected by a topological @xmath0 invariant .",
    "when time reversal symmetry is broken , the system may realize a quantum anomalous hall ( qah)@xcite insulator with chiral edge states protected by so - called tknn or chern invariant.@xcite their intriguing properties have been a subject of intensive investigations in recent years .",
    "experimentally qsh effect has been demonstrated in hgte / cdte quantum wells@xcite and inverted inas / gasb quantum wells,@xcite and qah effect has been demonstrated in cr - doped ( bi , sb)@xmath1te@xmath2 thin films recently.@xcite these discoveries further stimulate significant interests in searching for new topological states of matter .    in solid state systems",
    ", soc comes into the hamiltonian in different forms due to different physical origins . for example , in iii - v semiconductor quantum wells , there is dresselhaus soc from bulk crystalline inversion symmetry breaking , and there also exists rashba soc from structural inversion symmetry breaking along the growth direction .",
    "the ability to tune the strength of each individual soc and control their competition is at the heart of spintronics applications . in the seminal work by kane and mele that proposed the 2d @xmath0 topological insulator ,",
    "two types of soc were considered : the intrinsic soc and the rashba soc.@xcite it has been shown that the intrinsic soc favors the qsh state while the rashba soc tends to destroy it . hence their competition determines the topological phase transitions and the phase boundaries between the topologically trivial and nontrivial insulating states .    the kane - mele model was first proposed for graphene .",
    "later studies showed that the magnitude of intrinsic soc in graphene is too small for the qsh effect to be detected experimentally.@xcite recently , a lot of new 2d materials have been discovered with enhanced intrinsic type soc , such as silicene and germanene@xcite which are group iv counterparts of graphene and 2d honeycomb bi / sb halides and hydrides .",
    "the strength of intrinsic soc can be as large as 0.6ev as in some bi halides .",
    "this provides promising systems to realize the kane - mele model and the qsh effect at room temperature .    in the study of 2d physics ,",
    "bilayer systems have attracted a lot of interest . compared with single layer system ,",
    "the extra layer degree of freedom can lead to many new physical phenomena and is usually easier to control in practice.@xcite furthermore , in terms of topological properties , bilayer systems can differ qualitatively from single layer systems . for example , when two single layers of qsh insulator are combined to form a bilayer system , its @xmath0 invariant vanishes and the system becomes topologically trivial . as another example , it has been found that the rashba soc which tends to destroy the qsh phase in single layer turns out to favor qsh phase in bilayer graphene.@xcite all these indicate that the physics of bilayer is quite different from the single layer case .    in this work , motivated by the above mentioned progress , we study the effects of different socs in a bilayer kane - mele model , focusing on its topological properties .",
    "we find that the bilayer system exhibits a very rich phase diagram .",
    "quite interestingly , we discover novel 2d topological metallic phases in this system due to the competition between the intrinsic soc and the rashba soc : the 2d @xmath0-metallic phase and the chern metallic phase , depending on whether time reversal symmetry is broken . in such phases ,",
    "the bulk band gap is closed indirectly , hence a topological invariant can still be well defined , and the state is adiabatically connected to a topologically nontrivial insulator . like topological insulating phases ,",
    "the hallmark of the topological metallic phase is the presence of edge states determined by the bulk topology . for @xmath0-metallic phase , they are the spin helical edge states , while for chern metallic phase",
    ", they are the chiral edge states .",
    "these findings not only extend our understanding of topological states of matter but also may find useful applications based on topological materials .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the bilayer kane - mele model that we study . in section iii ,",
    "we investigate the case with preserved time reversal symmetry and show that a metallic phase with well - defined @xmath0 invariant and spin helical edge states can be realized .",
    "section iv is for the case with time reversal symmetry breaking and we show that there exists a metallic phase with well - defined chern invariant and chiral edge states .",

    "the total hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the hamiltonians for the upper layer and lower layer respectively .",

    "the second term @xmath23 is the intrinsic soc involving the next - nearest neighbor hopping with amplitude @xmath7 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the vector along the bond from site @xmath26 to a nearest site @xmath27 .",

    "the intrinsic soc is from the crystalline structure of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "for graphene with a flat planar structure , its value is small because it is a second order process .",
    "however , for a low - buckled structure in which a and b sites have a relative shift in the out of plane direction , the intrinsic soc can be greatly enhanced , as in silicene and germanene .",
    "the rashba soc here is due to inversion symmetry breaking along the out of plane direction , which may be induced by a substrate or an external electric field along @xmath35-direction .    when @xmath36 , the system has both inversion symmetry and time reversal symmetry , the system is a zero gap semiconductor . a finite @xmath18 breaks inversion symmetry , while a finite @xmath34 breaks time reversal symmetry , leading to symmetry - breaking ground states .",

    ", the chern invariant must vanish .",
    "however , the system can still have a nontrivial @xmath0 invariant . if the system has preserved spin component , e.g. with only intrinsic soc but vanishing rashba soc , the two spin species have opposite chern numbers .",
    "then the @xmath0 invariant just equals ( half ) the difference between the chern numbers of the two spin species @xmath44 ( modular 2 ) . for the general case with no conserved spin components ,",
    "the @xmath0 invariant can be computed using the following formula@xcite @xmath45 \\,\\ , \\text{mod}\\,2,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the berry connection summed over all the occupied bands , @xmath47 is the periodic part of the bloch state for band @xmath48 .",

    "hbz denotes half of the brillouin zone , and the line integral is along the boundary of the hbz . in this approach ,",
    "the following constraint needs to be imposed on the wave function for the line integral : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the time reversal operator .",
    "the @xmath52 state is topologically distinct from the @xmath53 state , in that they can not be adiabatically connected to each other ( through tuning some system parameter ) without closing the bulk gap .",
    "the @xmath53 state is connected to the trivial vacuum , hence is the trivial insulating state .",
    "the @xmath52 state is nontrivial , and is known as the qsh state .",
    "it has an odd number of kramers pairs of helical edge channels that are protected by time reversal symmetry .",
    "it has been shown that the single layer kane - mele model with only intrinsic soc is a @xmath52 qsh ground state .",
    "this phase persists with finite rashba soc as long as the bulk gap does not close .",
    "when further increasing rashba soc , the gap finally closes and the qsh phase is destroyed . for a bilayer kane - mele model with each layer being a @xmath52 insulator , the combined system is in fact trivial because @xmath54 ( mod 2 ) .",
    "the case of bilayer model with only rashba soc has been studied before .",
    "it has been found that under finite interlayer potential @xmath18 , the rashba soc in fact helps to realize a qsh state .",
    "when the intrinsic soc comes into the play , from previous discussion one expects that it tends to drive the system into the trivial phase , hence it has a competition with the rashba soc in the topological phase transition .",
    "here we calculate the topological phase diagram reflecting the competition between the two socs . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaseisb ] as functions of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "the boundary between different topological phases corresponds to the states where the conduction band and the valence band touch .",
    "the black lines in the diagram mark such band - touching states . here",
    "a finite interlayer potential @xmath18 is taken to open a bulk gap at first place .",
    "we observe that the phase diagram is divided by the band - touching lines into three regions .",
    "as expected , for large @xmath7 , when intrinsic soc dominates over rashba soc , the system takes a @xmath53 trivial phase ( the upper part labeled as region iii ) . for the opposite case , when rashba soc dominates over intrinsic soc for large @xmath8 , the system takes a @xmath52 qsh phase ( the lower right part labeled as region ii ) .",
    "one notes that the band - touching lines separates out another region at the lower left corner ( region i ) when both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are small , which also has @xmath53 .",
    "although both i and iii are trivial in terms of @xmath0 classification , region i differs from iii in the valley chern number .",
    "strictly speaking , the chern invariant ( number ) is defined only for a closed manifold,@xcite @xmath55 where the integral is usually over the brillouin zone .",
    "because berry curvature is odd under time reversal , the total chern number must vanish in our present case . for a honeycomb lattice",
    ", the brillouin zone has a hexagon shape and the energy spectrum has two valleys k and k at the corners of the brillouin zone , where the berry curvature @xmath56 is concentrated . in fig .",
    "[ fig : z2metal](b ) , we plot a typical berry curvature distribution in @xmath57-space .",
    "one observes that the curvature is peaked around the valleys , and it has different sign between k and k valleys .",
    "therefore one can define a valley chern number @xmath39 as the difference between the integrals of the berry curvature around the two valleys . for the three regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaseisb ] , we have @xmath58 for region i , @xmath59 for region ii , and @xmath60 for region iii .",
    "the valley chern number physically determines the quantum valley hall ( qvh ) conductance of the system.@xcite hence region i corresponds to a qvh phase while region iii is valley hall trivial .",
    "what is more interesting of the present system is that we find there are extended regions around the phase boundaries in which the states are in fact metallic .",
    "the global bulk gap closes in the colored regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaseisb ] . because a metal does not have a stable ground state against excitations ,",
    "usually it does not permit a topological phase .",
    "at the first sight , one might guess that the colored area in region ii is just a trivial metallic phase , for which topological invariant can not be defined . however , we find that although these states do not have a global bulk gap , they do have a local bulk gap at every @xmath57-point in the brillouin zone . in fig .",
    "[ fig : z2metal](a ) , we plot the map of local direct gap of such a metallic state .",
    "it shows that the local gap is always bigger than zero .",
    "this means that the valence bands are still well - separated from the conduction bands and form an isolated manifold .",
    "they are adiabatically connected to the insulating state in each region without closing the local bulk gap ( band - touching ) , hence also share the corresponding topological invariants .",
    "we are most interested in the metallic states in region ii . from the above argument",
    ", the metallic states there should have @xmath52 with spin helical edge channels , representing a 2d @xmath0-metallic phase . in fig .",
    "[ fig : z2metal](c ) , we show the energy spectrum calculated for a ribbon geometry of the system , corresponding to the marked point in the phase diagram .",
    "we observe that the band gap closes indirectly and there are edge states connecting between the conduction band and the valence band .",
    "we analyze their spatial distributions and spin polarizations .",
    "the result is plotted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : z2metal](d ) . from this figure",
    ", we can clearly observe that on each edge , there is one kramers pair of spin helical edge states , as dictated by the @xmath52 requirement .",
    "as long as the time reversal symmetry is preserved , the two states on the same edge can not be mixed with each other .",
    "however , scattering with finite momentum transfer may couple these state with the bulk states .",
    "such @xmath0-metallic state is analogous to the 3d sb crystal .",
    "it has been found that the band gap of sb also closes indirectly and its ground state has a nontrivial 3d @xmath0 invariant@xcite .",
    "there are two differences .",
    "one is that the current @xmath0-metallic state is realized in a 2d system .",
    "the other one is its emergence here is a result of the competition between two types of soc .",
    "as observed from the phase diagram , it requires both @xmath7 and @xmath8 to have finite values .",
    "the unique feature of this @xmath0-metallic state is the existence of topologically protected spin helical edge channels along with a metallic bulk .",
    "similar arguments apply to the metallic states in region i and region iii as well .",
    "those metallic states also maintain a local gap across the brillouin zone .",
    "they are adiabatically connected to the corresponding insulating states in each region , hence share the same topological properties of those insulating states .",
    "therefore , the colored area in region iii is a trivial metallic phase , while the colored region in region i is a qvh metallic phase .",

    "iii , @xmath7 dominates over @xmath8 , and we have @xmath67 indicating that it is a trivial phase .",

    "the metallic states in region iii are trivial , while the metallic states in region ii are topologically nontrivial .",
    "let s focus on the states in region ii , which has a chern number @xmath66 .",
    "the adiabatic connectivity means that the metallic state shares the same topological character as the chern insulator state : it also has chiral edge states and a chern number can be defined for its valence bands with @xmath66 .",
    "we shall call these novel states as chern metals .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : chernmetal](b ) , we show the berry curvature distribution in the @xmath57-space for the @xmath61 metallic state marked by the dot in the phase diagram .",

    "[ fig : chernmetal](d ) . on each edge , there are four channels propagating along the same direction , as required by the chern number @xmath66 . because it is a metallic state , the chiral edge states are not so robust as those in an insulating state because scattering may couple these edge states with the bulk states .",
    "the existence of chiral edge channels along with a conducting bulk is the hallmark of this novel chern metallic phase . from the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : phasetsb ] , we see that its appearance must require both @xmath8 and @xmath7 to have a finite value .",
    "hence like the @xmath0-metallic state , it is a result of the competition between intrinsic soc and rashba soc .",
    "in this work , we have studied the topological phases of a bilayer kane - mele model in detail .",
    "we find that the system exhibits a rich phase diagram as a result of the competition between intrinsic soc and rashba soc .",
    "in contrast to the single layer case , there emerge novel 2d topological metallic phases that can be adiabatically connected to their topological insulator counterparts . in the presence of time reversal symmetry , we find there is @xmath0-metallic phase with nontrivial @xmath0 invariant and spin helical edge states .",
    "when time reversal symmetry is broken , there exists chern metallic phase with nontrivial chern invariant and chiral edge states .",
    "these findings broaden our knowledge of the topological states of matter .",
    "it also shows that by controlling the competition between different socs , one can tune the topological phase and control both the bulk and edge conduction , which could be useful in applications based on topological materials .    _ acknowledgement .",
