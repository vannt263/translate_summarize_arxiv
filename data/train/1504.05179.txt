    "the `` susceptibility '' of an atom toward the generation of an atomic dipole moment is described by the dynamic atomic ( dipole ) polarizability .",

    "the atomic polarizability has both a real as well as an imaginary part .",
    "physically , this can be illustrated by considering the relative permittivity @xmath4 of a dilute gas and its relation to the dynamic dipole polarizability @xmath5 of the gas atoms , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath8 is the volume density of gas atoms  @xcite .",

    "this consideration has recently been generalized to the two - photon self - energy  @xcite , which helped clarify the role of cascade contributions which need to be separated from the coherent two - photon correction to the decay rate  @xcite .",

    "one may ask what is the energetically degenerate state to which the reference state could `` decay '' . in the case of the ground - state atomic polarizability , one may additionally point out that the atom already is in the ground state and can not go energetically lower .",
    "how could the `` decay rate '' be formulated under these conditions ?",
    "the answer is that a quantum state with the atom in the ground state , @xmath26 laser photons of energy @xmath27 , and one photon of wave vector @xmath28 and polarization @xmath29 , with energy @xmath30 ( but not the same polarization or propagation direction ) is energetically degenerate with respect to the reference state ( with the atom still in the ground state , and @xmath24 laser photons ) .",
