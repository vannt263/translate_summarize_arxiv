    "in the second week of december 2004 , we obtained the frequency of www documents corresponding to positive integers @xmath5 in the range between 1 and @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "this plot contains a set of regularly distributed peaks , which indicate that different types of numbers occur with very unlike frequencies .",
    "for example , the number of documents containing round ( ending with 0 ) numbers is much higher than that for non - round numbers .",
    "furthermore , the special number 2004 occurs with a remarkably high frequency : @xmath12 pages . for comparison , among @xmath13 www pages covered by the used search engine ,",
    "a single character string @xmath14 occurs in about @xmath15 pages , while the numbers 0 , 1 and 1000 occur in @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 pages , respectively .",
    "the high , asymmetric peak of @xmath4 around @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ f1]b ) is naturally identified as the contribution of documents containing numbers associated to years ; below @xmath19 , this peak can be fitted by a power law , following @xmath20 , where @xmath21 ( inset of fig .",
    "therefore , in the vicinity of 2004 , @xmath4 increases with @xmath5 much faster than the total number of pages in the www grows with time , which indicates that there are many pages with numbers associated to years that disappear from the www ( or at least , are updated ) after a while .",
    "indeed , our observations prove that the amount of pages holding a number @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is time measured in years ) in the region of the ` critical singularity ' decreases with @xmath23 approximately following @xmath24 .",
    "we find that the frequency of occurrence of natural numbers , considered without separating them into distinct classes ( fig .",
    "[ f1]a ) , is a slowly decreasing dependence .",
    "nevertheless , it can hardly be fitted by any power law because it is , in fact , the result of the superposition of distributions of distinct kinds of numbers , which , in turn , are power laws having different exponents . in order to proceed",
    ", we then compare the statistics of the www documents which hold two ` extreme ' types of numbers : ( i ) powers of 10 , which should occur with the highest frequencies due to the common decimal numeral system , and , contrastingly , ( ii ) non - round numbers ( i.e. those with a non - zero digit in the end ) which are , on average , the most indistinctive ones , therefore occurring with the lowest frequencies .",
    "it is worth remarking that , even though the non - round include many peculiar numbers , such as 777 for example , we find that their contribution does not change the statistics noticeably .",
    "the strikingly high frequency of occurrence of powers of 10 in the www allows us to obtain the statistics for numbers up to @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ f2]a ) , a range that is restricted by the limited size of strings being accepted by the used search engine ( 128 characters ) .",
    "two distinct regions are seen in the distribution .",
    "the region of relatively ` small ' numbers , up to @xmath25 ( fig .  [",
    "f2]b ) , is of a power - law form , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , hence close to the law @xmath28 ; note that this exponent is much smaller than 1 and far smaller than the values of the exponents of typical zipf s law distributions @xcite , these being mostly in the range between 2 and 3 . for comparison , the occurrence frequencies of a character string _",
    "baaa  a _ of varying length were also measured , a quite different , far from straight line , dependence having been observed ( fig .",
    "for @xmath5 larger than @xmath25 , we observe an extremely slow decrease of the frequency of occurrence of pages containing powers of @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "it is worth noting that the crossover between these two regimes turns out to be rather close to the maximum 32 digit binary number , which is about @xmath30 .",
    "for properly measuring the occurrence frequency of non - round numbers , we use a set of intervals selected in their wide range , each of which having a width of 50 numbers , so that the relative variation of the frequency of www pages inside a specific interval is sufficiently small .",
    "in addition , these intervals are chosen far from the powers of 10 , whose close neighborhood includes numbers , such as , for instance , 1009 , that occur more often and whose distribution does not follow a clear power law . within each of these intervals , we take the average values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 , and denote them by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively ; the resulting dependence ( fig .  [ f3 ] ) has a prominent power - law region with exponent @xmath33 , which strongly differs from that ascertained for powers of 10 . as",
    "numbers grow , the ratio of the amount of www documents with powers of 10 to that with non - round numbers increases , following the @xmath34 dependence .    a few mechanisms generating power - law distributions @xcite are known @xcite . most of these mechanisms explain power laws as a result of a specific self - organization of a non - equilibrium system , and we treat our observations in the spirit of these approaches .",
    "evidently , the array of numbers in human documents is an evolving system , and the stochastic growth of this array is due to a permanent influx of numbers , added with new documents . the added numbers ( among which may also occur new distinct ones , that were not employed previously ) are chosen from a distribution which is determined by the one for the existing numbers . here",
    "we do not discuss a specific model exploiting this mechanism and generating the observed complex distributions , but , instead , we explain the reason for the unusual small values of exponents which we observed  @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( figs .  [ f2]b and [ f3 ] ) , while typical zipf s law exponents are @xmath37 and greater .",
    "at least , zipf s law exponents must take values greater than @xmath38 . at first sight , this difference seems surprising , since the mechanisms of the power laws are quite similar .",
    "but , importantly , these two sets of exponents are defined for different distributions . in our non - traditional case",
    ", the observed power law describes the behavior of the frequency of www pages with a given natural number @xmath5 , namely @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast , typical zipf s law exponent @xmath39 occurs in a power law for a quite different quantity : in our terms , this quantity is the amount , @xmath40 , of distinct numbers , where each of them occurs in every of @xmath41 web pages .",
    "so , we have the relation @xmath42 .",
    "one can show that the exponents @xmath7 and @xmath39 satisfy a simple relation , @xmath43 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "if the @xmath39 exponent is greater than @xmath37 , which is typical for simple linear growth processes , the @xmath7 exponent is smaller than @xmath38 , as in fig .",
    "[ f2]b . on the other hand",
    ", nonlinear growth may produce exponents @xmath39 below @xmath37 , which gives @xmath7 greater than @xmath38 , as in fig .",
    "the distributions reported here demonstrate that the frequencies of www pages holding numbers even of the same kind ( for example , non - round numbers ) strongly fluctuate from number to number . for documents containing non - round integers ,",
    "we obtain the dependence of the fluctuations amplitude ( i.e. dispersion ) , @xmath44 , on the average frequency , @xmath32 , of these documents ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) . for calculating these dispersions and mean values",
    ", we used the same intervals as in fig .",
    "the resulting dependence turns out to be proportional , @xmath45 , over a broad region of values @xmath32 , which crucially differs from the square root behavior of standard statistical fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the usual reason for such a strong difference is that the fluctuations of the quantities under study are not statistically independent @xcite . in this respect , there is only one factor in the evolution of the array of numbers which can break the statistical independence of fluctuations , namely , the variation of the influx of numbers .",
    "so , the observed proportional law proves that the variations of the occurrence frequencies of numbers are an outcome of the fluctuations of their global influx in the www .",
    "these observations suggest a new view of the array of integers in the www ( and in nature ) as a complex , evolving , inhomogeneous system .",
    "the statistics of numbers turns out to be far more rich and complex than one might expect based on classical benford s law .",
    "moreover , our findings provide a tool for extracting meaningful information from statistical data on the frequency of occurrence of numbers . as an illustration ,",
    "consider the two integers , 666 and 777 , with clear associations .",
    "we find that these numbers occur in the www with frequencies of @xmath46 and @xmath47 pages , respectively , which are @xmath48 and @xmath49 times higher than , on average , the occurrence frequencies of their non - round neighbors .",
    "these deviations are to a great extent higher than what one would anticipate from the relative amplitude of fluctuations , 0.1 .",
    "therefore , we can reasonably compare the amounts of pages containing 666 and 777 obtained after subtracting the numbers of pages holding the neighbors of these two integers .",
    "these subtractions give @xmath50 and @xmath51 pages for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "it is the difference ( or , rather , the relative difference ) between the two last amounts that should be used as a starting point for a subsequent comparative analysis .",
    "the proposed approach is very suggestive . indeed , by analyzing the frequencies of occurrence of specific ` popular ' numbers with clear interpretations one could evaluate the relative significance of the corresponding underlining factors of this popularity .",
    "many more questions lie ahead : how do the occurrence frequencies of specific numbers vary in time ? how do different numbers correlate and co - occur in www documents ?",
    "it is well known that humans can easily memorize only up to rather limited sequences of digits @xcite , which are , therefore , many times replaced by words ( like , for instance , the ip addresses of computers ) .",
    "then , how does the statistics of numbers relate to the organization of human memory and to semantics ? our findings quantitatively show the key role of the common decimal numeral system  a direct consequence of the number of fingers . how do other numeral systems ( the binary system , for example ) influence the general statistics of numbers ?",
    "the global array of numbers is surmised to be a `` numeric snapshot of the collective consciousness '' @xcite .",
    "so , the study of their statistics could lead to a better understanding of a wide circle of sociological and psychological phenomena .",
    "the distribution of numbers in human documents contains a wealth of diverse information in an integrated form .",
    "the detailed analysis of the general statistics of numbers in the www could allow the effective extraction and evaluation of this hidden information .",

    "<S> the distribution of numbers in human documents is determined by a variety of diverse natural and human factors , whose relative significance can be evaluated by studying the numbers frequency of occurrence . although it has been studied since the 1880 s , this subject remains poorly understood . here </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the detailed statistics of numbers in the world wide web , finding that their distribution is a heavy - tailed dependence which splits in a set of power - law ones . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the frequency of numbers associated to western calendar years shows an uneven behavior : 2004 represents a ` singular critical ' point , appearing with a strikingly high frequency ; as we move away from it , the decreasing frequency allows us to compare the amounts of existing information on the past and on the future . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , while powers of ten occur extremely often , allowing us to obtain statistics up to the huge @xmath0 , ` non - round ' numbers occur in a much more limited range , the variations of their frequencies being dramatically different from standard statistical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> these findings provide a view of the array of numbers used by humans as a highly non - equilibrium and inhomogeneous system , and shed a new light on an issue that , once fully investigated , could lead to a better understanding of many sociological and psychological phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> already in the early 1880 s , newcomb @xcite noticed a specific uneven distribution of the first digits of numbers , which is now known as benford s law @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed form of this distribution indicates the wide , skewed shape of the frequency of occurrence of numbers in nature [ 35 ] for illustration , and to clarify the question , note that in these first two sentences the numerals 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 1880 all occur twice . </S>",
    "<S> benford s law is directly derived by assuming that a number occurs with a frequency inversely proportional to it , meaning that the frequencies of numbers in the intervals @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> are equal . yet </S>",
    "<S> , this assumption lacks convincing quantitative support and understanding , in part due to scanty data available . in our days , this problem can be tackled by resorting ( with the help of search engines ) to the enormous database constituted by the world wide web .    </S>",
    "<S> one should note that the profoundly wide form of the distribution of numbers in human documents is determined by two sets of factors . </S>",
    "<S> the first includes general natural reasons of which the most important is the multi - scale organization of our world . the second </S>",
    "<S> are ` human factors ' including the current technological level of the society , the structure of languages , adopted numeral and calendar systems , history , cultural traditions and religions , human psychology , and many others . by analyzing the occurrence frequency of numbers we can estimate the relative significance and role of these factors .    . </S>",
    "<S> [ t1 ] * typical numbers with high frequencies of occurrence * [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the frequency of occurrence of numbers in the world wide web pages ( or , in other words , www documents ) necessarily reflects the distribution of numbers in all human documents , allowing us to effectively study their statistics by using search engines , which usually supply the approximate number of pages containing the arabic numeral that we are looking for . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> , the www provides us with huge statistics . </S>",
    "<S> yet , the frequencies of occurrence of distinct kinds of numbers are very different @xcite : for example , one can see that 777 and 1000 occur much more frequently than their neighbors ( table [ t1 ] ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on the markedly distinct statistics of different types of natural numbers ( or , rather , positive integers ) in the www documents , collected through the currently most popular search engine @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider separately ( i ) powers of 10 and ( ii ) non - round integers , and find that in both of these cases , the number @xmath4 of pages containing an integer @xmath5 decays as a power law , @xmath6 , over many orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the observed values of the @xmath7 exponent strongly differ for the different types of numbers , ( i ) and ( ii ) , and also differ from 1 , thus contradicting the above mentioned assumption of inverse proportionality for their frequency of occurrence .    </S>",
    "<S> note that previously scale - free ( i.e. power - law ) distributions were observed for processes in the www @xcite and its structural characteristics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , and in contrast to these studies , we use the www as a database for measuring one of the basic distributions in nature . in order to explain the observed distributions , we treat the global array of numbers as a non - equilibrium , evolving system with a specific influx of numbers , and , as a reflection of this non - equilibrium nature , we find a ` critical behavior ' of @xmath4 in the neighborhood of @xmath8 ( the current year at the time the measurements were made ) : near this point , the frequency of www documents follows a power law , @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the statistics of variations of the frequencies of www pages which contain close numbers of the same kind , dramatically disagrees with the standard distribution of statistical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we observe , namely , that the amplitude of these variations , @xmath10 , is much greater than what would be expected for standard statistical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the frequencies of pages containing different numbers fluctuate not independently , these fluctuations being a reflection of those of the influx of numbers . </S>"
