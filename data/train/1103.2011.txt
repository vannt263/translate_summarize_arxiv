    "t. e. harris wrote the first definitive book @xcite on branching processes , published in 1963 .",
    "it covered much of the work on the subject up to that time , a sizeable part due to harris himself .",
    "it identified the subject of branching processes and resulted in a great deal of interest in the subject , among both mathematicians and statisticians . between 1963 and 1970 , a vast number of papers on branching processes appeared in many good journals specializing in probability theory and mathematical statistics , and by 1971 more books on the subject appeared both in the u.s . and",
    "elsewhere @xcite .",
    "harris himself moved on to work on other beautiful topics such as percolation and interacting particle systems . as with branching processes ,",
    "his work in these other areas was profound .",
    "t. e. harris was pioneer par excellence , creating many areas of research in which he laid the foundations that others built on . in",
    "what follows , we present a brief account of harris s contribution to branching processes .",
    "harris s 1947 phd dissertation at the mathematics department of princeton university was on branching processes , titled `` some theorems on bernoulli multiplicative processes . ''",
    "this was followed in 1948 by his basic paper @xcite in the _ annals of mathematical statistics_. in @xcite , he used the term _ branching processes _ , a  term which had also been used by russian mathematicians ; he treated the single type discrete time branching process .",
    "he also coined the term _ galton ",
    "watson branching process _ for this process .",
    "his main focus in @xcite was on the supercritical case ; we now give a description of this work .",
    "let @xmath0 be a probability distribution .",
    "let @xmath1 be an array of nonnegative integer valued random variables that are i.i.d .",
    "( independent and identically distributed ) with distribution @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a positive integer .",
    "now set @xmath3 and for @xmath4 , @xmath5 if @xmath6 and 0 if @xmath7 .",
    "then the sequence @xmath8 is called a galton  watson branching process with initial population @xmath2 and offspring distribution @xmath0 . clearly , @xmath8 is a markov chain with time homogeneous transition probabilities and the nonnegative integers as the state space .",
    "the transition probabilities are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 are i.i.d .",
    "with distribution @xmath11 .    one can interpret the sequence @xmath8 as follows .",
    "if @xmath12 is thought of as the number of individuals in the @xmath13th generation , then each one of them produces a random number of children with distribution @xmath0 independently of others in the @xmath13th generation as well as any past ancestors .",
    "the total number @xmath14 of all these individuals is the size of the @xmath15st generation .",
    "an important parameter in determining how the sequence @xmath8 behaves for @xmath13 large is the offspring mean @xmath16 . here",
    "are some basic results .",
    "let @xmath17 and let @xmath18 . then :    a.   @xmath19 as @xmath20 , b.   @xmath21 as @xmath20 , c.   @xmath22 as @xmath23 ,    where @xmath24 is the unique root of the equation @xmath25 further , @xmath26 as @xmath27 , and for any @xmath28 , @xmath29 as @xmath30 .",
    "harris in his book @xcite notes in that in 1874 in @xcite , galton and watson did notice that the _ extinction probability _ @xmath24 satisfied @xmath31 , but failed to notice that if @xmath32 the relevant root is less than one .",
    "galton and watson s work was motivated by the problem of the survival of british peerage names , posed by galton in the _ london times _ in the 1870s .",
    "in his paper @xcite , which is based on his doctoral thesis , harris focused mainly on the _ supercritical case _ ,",
    "that is , @xmath32 .",
    "the case @xmath33 is called _ critical _ and @xmath34 is the _",
    "subcritical case_. let @xmath35 be as in theorem  1 .",
    "assume @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 .",
    "then there exists a nonnegative random variable @xmath40 such that :    a.   @xmath41 as @xmath42 , b.   @xmath43 , c.   @xmath40 has an absolutely continuous distribution an @xmath44 with a continuous density , d.   @xmath45 .",
    "harris @xcite observes that j. l. doob seems to have been the first to note that @xmath46 is a martingale and , being nonnegative , converges a.s . as @xmath42 .",

    "see athreya and ney @xcite for details ; see also sevastyanov @xcite and mode @xcite .",
    "in 1948 harris , with richard bellman @xcite , formulated the theory of age dependent branching processes , where each individual lives a random length of time and on death creates a random number of individuals , and all individuals live and reproduce independently of each other . assuming all moments on the offspring distribution and an absolutely continuous life time distribution",
    ", they established an integral equation for the probability generating function of @xmath60 , the population size at time @xmath61 .",
    "they showed that in the supercritical case , @xmath62 converges in probability to a limit random variable @xmath40 , where @xmath63 is the _ malthusian parameter _ defined by @xmath64 , with @xmath65 being the distribution function of the lifetime of an individual .",
    "they further showed that @xmath40 is nontrivial and has an absolutely continuous distribution on @xmath44 .",
    "there are analogs of theorems 2.3 and 2.4 for this case , as well .",
    "conditions for the supercritical case were relaxed by later authors ; see athreya and ney @xcite .",
    "harris also considered branching processes with arbitrary type space by using the point process approach . here in any generation , one has a finite point process an some type space @xmath66 .",
    "the basic branching property of independent production is retained .",
    "an individual located at @xmath67 produces children according to a point process over @xmath66 whose distribution depends on @xmath68 .",
    "all individuals act independently of each other . for this , harris used the method of moment generating functions . in @xcite , he established the analog of theorem 2.2 in this context , and applied this to nuclear cascades and related processes , as well as a one - dimensional neutron model . for details on this ,",
    "see harris s",
    "book @xcite .",
    "harris mentions that j. e. moyal worked on similar ideas . in the 1970s , jagers and his colloborators in sweden",
    "developed this topic further in great detail ( see @xcite ) .",
    "see also ney @xcite .",
    "harris studied the theory of cosmic - rays cascades and supplemented the work of nuclear physicists ; chapter 7 of his 1963 book @xcite deals with this topic .",
    "we present a brief summary of harris s work on cosmic - ray cascades as discussed in his paper @xcite . here",
    "are the model assumptions :    \\(1 ) a photon of positive energy @xmath69 , moving through homogeneous material , has probability @xmath70 of being transformed in the thickness interval @xmath71 into two electrons , positive or negative , which receive energies @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , where @xmath74 is a random variable with an absolutely continuous distribution in @xmath75 .",
    "note that the role of time parameter is played by the thickness of the material .",
    "\\(2 ) an electron loses ( by `` collision '' or `` ionization '' ) a deterministic amount of energy @xmath76 in an interval of length @xmath61 .",
    "\\(3 ) an electron radiates photons in such a way that the probability that an electron of energy @xmath69 emits a photon of energy between @xmath77 and @xmath78 in a small thickness interval of length @xmath79 is @xmath80 .",
    "further , the energy that goes to the radiated photon is subtracted from that of the parent photon .",
    "a special case of interest for @xmath81 is @xmath82 with @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are constants and @xmath86 .    here",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 are constants independent of @xmath61 and @xmath69 .    under the above assumptions",
    ", harris shows that if @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the energy at time @xmath61 of an electron with @xmath91 then , for @xmath92 has an infinitely divisible distribution with probability density @xmath93 , whose characteristic function ( fourier transform ) is given by @xmath94 harris observes that the special case when @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the gamma density @xmath97 , this was given by bhabha and heitler @xcite .",
    "next , harris considers the random process @xmath98 , the total number of electrons at @xmath61 whose energies are greater than @xmath69 , for @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath100 , where @xmath101 stands for expectation when the starting particle is of energy 1 , and is a photon for @xmath102 and an electron for @xmath103 .",
    "harris shows that the following integro - differential equation holds : @xmath104k(u)\\,du,\\ ] ] with @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for .",
    "harris shows that the earlier results of bartlett and kendall @xcite and of janossy @xcite could be deduced from the above .",
    "harris introduces a vector valued markov process @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the condition of a single particle at time @xmath61 which can be a photon @xmath110 or an electron @xmath111 and has energy @xmath112 .",
    "he then derives the limiting distribution of the process @xmath113 as @xmath114 ( assuming @xmath89 ) and is able to deduce the earlier results of other authors as special cases .",
    "harris also obtained results for cascades with @xmath115 .",
    "in particular , he shows that when @xmath115 , the energy @xmath116 of an electron at time @xmath61 can be represented by @xmath117",

    "he laid a rigorous foundation to areas where it had been lacking .",
    "his 1963 book @xcite is a beautiful and major work of scholarship .",
    "one can substantially credit to its publication the explosion of work on branching processes in the 1960s and 1970s and up to the present .",
