    "quantum computation provides an unprecedented computaional power over classical computation . with the quantum parallelism , quantum algorithms such as shor s factoring algorithm  @xcite and gover s searching algorithm  @xcite ,",
    "provide strong evidences that quantum computation can gain exponential speed - up in many practical problems .",
    "however , on the way to realizing practical scalable quantum information processing , errors from quantum gates in the control process and decoherence caused by the inevitable interaction between the physical system and its environment are two main difficulties encountered .",
    "adiabatic holonomic quantum computation ( ahqc ) , as a promising quatum computation model , was first proposed by zanardi and rasetti  @xcite based on wilczek - zee geometric phases .",
    "they discovered that non - abelian geometric phase can be used for implementing robust quantum gates , which is fault tolerant with certain errors in the control process , by encoding quantum information into degenerate energe subspaces of a hamiltonian depending on parameters and adiabatically evoluting the quantum states along a loop in the corresponding parameter space .",
    "further more , many adiabatic holonomic gates schemes have been proposed for trapped ions  @xcite , superconducting qubits  @xcite and semiconductor quantum dots  @xcite .    due to the long evolution time needed to fulfill the adiabatic condition , ahqc is diffcult to realize experimentally .",
    "nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation ( nhqc )  @xcite was proposed to avoid the long run - time requirement based on nonadiabatic and non - abelian geometric phases  @xcite , while retaining the advantages of geometric nature . although nhqc was just proposed recently , it gains increasing attentions because of its combining speed and universality , where lots of theoretical schemes  @xcite are prompted and meanwhile nhqc has been realized experimentally in nmr  @xcite , superconducting quantum devices  @xcite and diamond nitrogen - vacancy centers  @xcite recently .",
    "all the previous shemes of nhqc have to use at least two sequentially implemented gates to realize a general one - qubit gate .",
    "two recent schemes  @xcite for one - qubit nonadiabatic holonomic gates were put forward where one can avoid the extra work of combining two gates into one , realizing an arbitrary one - qubit gate with a single - shot implementation . in this letter",
    ", we report the first experimental realization of one - qubit nonadiabatic holonomic gate of single - shot scheme in a liquid nmr quantum information processor . by modifying the original three - level quantum system scheme ,",
    "a two - qubit quantum system instead is constructed with a work qubit and an ancillary qubit . to prove the realization of single - shot holonomic gates , nonadiabatic holonomic rotations along @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes respectively as examples are implemented experimentally in a two - qubit nmr quantum information processor .",
    "@xcite , consider a three - level quantum system with driving laser fields , and its effective hamiltonian @xmath3 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "after a time period @xmath6 , evolution operator @xmath7 in the basis @xmath8 can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath7 is equivalent to @xmath11 which is in the logical subspace spanned by @xmath12 @xmath13 by selecting proper parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , one can achieve arbitrary one - qubit holonomic gate with single - shot implementation .",
    "now , let s review the holonomic conditions .",
    "consider an @xmath17-dimensional quantum system with its hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "assume the state of the system is initially in a @xmath19-dimensional subspace @xmath20 spanned by a set of orthonormal basis vectors @xmath21 .",
    "it has been proven that  @xcite the evolution operator is a holonomic matrix acting on @xmath20 if @xmath22 satisfy the following conditions : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the evolution period and @xmath26\\left|\\phi_k(0)\\right\\rangle$ ] and @xmath27 being time odering .    here",
    "we construct a four - level system consisting of two qubits and label a subspace @xmath28 as our logical working space , i.e. , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . in such way , the first qubit acts as an ancillary qubit and the whole information of the logical qubit is encoded in the work qubit ( the second qubit ) . to realize two noncommuting nonadiabatic one - qubit gates ,",
    "simply , two rotation operators along @xmath0 axis and @xmath1 axis respectively , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , two different hamiltonians @xmath33 and @xmath34 are designed to match their respective rotations , as presented below : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a @xmath40 dimensional identity matrix , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are pauli matrices . in another way , expressing @xmath33 and @xmath34 as matrices in the basis @xmath44 : @xmath45 @xmath46    after a proper time @xmath47 , the two noncommuting rotation operations @xmath48 and @xmath49 generated by their respective hamiltonians @xmath33 and @xmath34 read @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 . according to eqs .",
    "( [ e1])-([e4 ] ) and subspace @xmath53 , we can easily prove both holonomic conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are satisfied , thus , both rotation operations @xmath48 and @xmath49 generated by @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively are one - qubit holonomic gates acting on subspace @xmath53 . in the logical subspace @xmath53 spanned by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be expressed as @xmath58 @xmath59 from which we can see @xmath48 and @xmath49 are exactly one - qubit rotation operations along @xmath60 and @xmath61 axis , respectively .",
    "till now , we construct two one - qubit noncommuting nonadiabatic holonomic gates and an arbitrary one - qubit nonadiabatic holonomic gate can be constructed in the same way with a single - shot implementation .",
    "since hamiltonians @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both time - independent , @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be split into @xmath17 slices with equal time interval , like @xmath62 @xmath63 if @xmath17 is large enough , in other words , each time interval @xmath64 is small enough , both @xmath48 and @xmath49 evolutions in each time interval can be approximated into a sequence of noncommuting evolutions in the order of @xmath65 by the aid of the trotter formula  @xcite .",
