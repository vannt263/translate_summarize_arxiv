    "one of the outstanding open questions in hadron physics is : are there meson - meson bound states ?",
    "the same mechanism of meson exchange that binds the deuteron could also in principle bind two mesons .",
    "the interest in this subject was renewed by the discovery of the new charmonium states . since their first appearance ,",
    "some of them were considered to be meson molecules .",
    "these states have already been discussed in some reviews @xcite . in this note",
    "we discuss how to look for molecules at the lhcb taking advantage of the unprecedented high statistics .",
    "we can look for meson molecules in three - body hadronic @xmath4 decays .",
    "since the phase space is large we can even try to use directly the dalitz diagram , which extends up to large values of the variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "all the known normal quark - antiquark intermediate resonant states , leave an imprint in the dalitz plot , which is directly related with the quantum numbers of the states and lead to the identification of the state .",
    "examples are : a continuous straight line , in the case of scalar states , a line with a hole , in the case of vector states , or a line with two holes , in the case of tensor states .",
    "[ fig1 ]    a sketch of a dalitz plot for a three - body meson decay is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where for each invariant parameter @xmath5 or @xmath6 it is shown the relative momentum of each one of the two particles @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "let us consider the case that the particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 are pions coming from the @xmath11 meson decay . of course this decay should produce a line parallel to the @xmath6 axis in the point @xmath12 .",
    "however , since the pions coming from the @xmath11 meson decay must have one unit of angular momentum , they can not go both to the same direction .",
    "therefore , no pions could be seen in the region where the relative momentum between them is small . from fig.[fig1 ] one can see that this region is just in the middle of the line parallel to the @xmath6 axis .",
    "therefore , a line characterizing a vector resonance state must have a hole in the middle , as mentioned above .",
    "now imagine that the resonant state is a loosely bound molecular state of the particles @xmath7 .",
    "a loosely bound molecular state can only exist when the relative momentum between the two mesons in the molecule is small . in this case one",
    "has exactly the opposite situation than the one discussed before : there will be no signal in the dalitz plot unless the two mesons in the molecular state go in the same diretion . or , in other words , one expect a small line parallel to the @xmath6 axis in the middle of the dalitz plot , approximately in the region where there is a hole in the line characterizing a vector resonance .",
    "the final particles observed in the three - body @xmath4 decays are pions and kaons .",
    "therefore , to observe a molecular state in the dalitz plot for a three - body @xmath4 decay , this molecular state must decay into pions and/or kaons .",
    "let us consider a @xmath13 loosely bound molecule with the quark content @xmath14 .",
    "this resonant state , hereafter called @xmath15 , is especially interesting because its mass , @xmath16 , should be approximately given by : @xmath17 and , therefore , it is quite visible in the @xmath4 decay dalitz plot .",
    "since for @xmath18-wave this molecule has @xmath19 , it can not decay into @xmath20 , but it will decay into @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , there are already data for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite . only in the first two of these cases",
    "the decay could go through the resonant state @xmath15 , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "for these cases , a small line with @xmath26 parallel to the @xmath6 axis should be seen in the dalitz plot , in the region where the two particles @xmath27 and @xmath28 have a small relative momentum .",
    "this signal should be very different from all other established resonant states decaying into @xmath29 , like the @xmath30 for instance , and should be only seen in the channels @xmath22 and @xmath31 .",
    "of course , the figure is very qualitative and it is not possible to say how large is the line segment around the indicated position .",
    "however , the observation of this structure in the dalitz plot of the two mentioned @xmath4 decays , and not in the others , would represent a strong evidence of the formation of this molecular state .",
    "the observation of a line that only appears in a certain piece of the @xmath6 axis with a fixed value of @xmath5 , and only for the decays @xmath22 and @xmath32 , could be interpreted as the existence of a weakly bound molecular state .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in a previous work @xcite we have investigated the possiblity that the light scalar states could be interpreted as tetraquark states .",
    "now we perform a complementary investigation , trying to understand a possible @xmath33 meson molecular state in the qcd sum rule ( qcdsr ) framework @xcite .",
    "the qcdsr approach is based on the correlator of hadronic currents .",
    "a generic two - point correlation function is given by    ( q)=id^4x  e^iq.x0| t [ j(x)j^(0 ) ] |0 , where the local current @xmath34 contains all the information about the hadron of interest , like quantum numbers , quarks content and so on .",
    "a molecular current can be constructed from the mesonic currents that describe the two mesons in the molecule . in the case of scalar @xmath13 state",
    "a possible current is : j= ( |u_i _ 5 u_i-|d_i _ 5 d_i ) , [ pse ] where @xmath35 are color indices , @xmath36 are the up down and strange quark fields respectively , and the mixing angle , @xmath37 , in the @xmath38 current is @xmath39 @xcite . in this work we use @xmath40 .    in general , there is no one to one correspondence between the current and the state , since a molecular current can be rewritten in terms of a sum over tetraquark type currents through a fierz transformation . however , as shown in @xcite , if the physical state is a molecular state , it would be better to choose a molecular type of current so that it has a large overlap with the physical state . in any case , it is very important to notice that since the current in eq .",
    "( [ 2po ] ) is local , it does not represent an extended object , with two mesons separated in space , but rather a very compact object with two singlet quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "the coupling of the scalar resonance @xmath15 , to the scalar current @xmath41 , can be parametrized in terms of a parameter @xmath42 as : 0 | j|r=.    in the qcd side evaluation of the correlator function in eq.([2po ] ) we work at leading order and consider condensates up to dimension six .",

    "we see that the convergence is reasonable for @xmath57 and very good for @xmath58 .",
    "however , as in the case of the light scalars @xcite , there is no pole dominance for these values of @xmath59 . this result could be interpreted in two different ways : i ) it could indicate that this state does not exist , or ii ) it could indicate that this state is not clearly separated from the continuum .",
    "the second interpretation can be applied to very broad states , as the light scalars @xmath60 and @xmath61 , since their widths are as large as the difference between their masses and the continuum threshold . in what follows",

    "[ fig5 ] , we show the resonance mass as a function of @xmath59 for different values of @xmath64 .",
    "we limit ourselves to the region @xmath57 where the curves are more stable and where the ope convergence is better . averaging the mass over all this region we find : m_r = ( 1.150.10 )  , [ msr ] which is compatible with the experimental threshold in eq.([massmoc ] ) . having the mass",

    "we get : g_r k^+k^-f_k^2m_r^2-m_k^2 ( e^-m_k^2/m^2-e^-m_r^2/m^2)&=&8((|qq+|ss)^23 + .",

    "@xcite , the problem of doing a single borel transformation , in a three - point function sum rule , is the fact that terms associated with the pole - continuum transitions are not suppressed .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the pole - continuum transition term has a different behavior , as a function of the borel mass , as compared with the double pole contribution : it grows with @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the pole - continuum contribution can be taken into account through the introduction of a parameter @xmath78 in the phenomenological side of the sum rule in eq .",
    "( [ sr3 ] ) , by making the substitution @xmath79 @xcite .    using @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and the parameter @xmath42 given by the sum rule in eq .",

    "[ fig6 ] ) , the coupling can be obtained by extrapolating the fit to @xmath85 . in the limits of the continuum thresholds",
    "mentioned above and taking into account the uncertainties in @xmath16 given in eq .",

    "however , in the @xmath4 decays discussed here , only the channel @xmath66 can be observed .",
    "the errors quoted above come directly from the uncertainty in the determination of the continuum threshold parameters , @xmath46 . according to our previous experience , they are the main source of uncertainty in the method . for a detailed analysis of the uncertainty associated to other parameters used in qcdsr",

    "we have proposed that a loosely bound molecular state should leave a particular signal in the dalitz plot .",
    "a loosely bound molecular state , of the particles @xmath7 , can only exist when the relative momentum between these two particles is small .",
