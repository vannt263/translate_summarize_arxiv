    "the action for einstein - aether theory in @xmath2 dimensions is s[g_ab , u^a , ] = d^nx ( r+l_u+ ( g_abu^a u^b - 1 ) ) , [ action ] where @xmath3 is the ricci scalar , @xmath4 is a lagrange multiplier enforcing the unit timelike constraint on @xmath1 , and the aether lagrangian is defined by l_u = c_1(_a u_b)(^a u^b ) + c_2(_a u^a)^2 + c_3(_a u_b)(^b u^a ) + c_4(u^a _ a u^b)(u^c _ c u_b ) [ lagrangian ] where the @xmath5 are dimensionless coupling constants , and @xmath4 is a lagrange multiplier .",

    "this action includes all generally covariant terms with up two two derivatives ( not including total divergences ) that can be constructed from a metric and a unit vector field .    in two - dimensional spacetime",
    "the variation of the einstein - hilbert term @xmath7 is a total divergence .",
    "the aether part of the action is non - trivial , but only two of the terms are independent . to see this we express the covariant derivative @xmath8 in the orthonormal basis @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a unit spacelike vector orthogonal to @xmath1 .",
    "it follows from @xmath11 and @xmath12 that @xmath13 everywhere . using these relations",

    "these expressions may be substituted into the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) without changing the equations of motion , since the lagrange multiplier term in the action ( [ action ] ) implies that the equations of motion are equivalent to the condition that the action be stationary only with respect to variations of @xmath1 that preserve the constraint @xmath17 . on the constraint surface",
