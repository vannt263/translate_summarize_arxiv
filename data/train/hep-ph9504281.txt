    "the theory of hard elastic scattering in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has evolved considerably over many years of work .",
    "currently there exist two self - consistent perturbative descriptions , each with a specific factorization method for separating the hard scattering from non - perturbative wave functions . a well - known procedure using the `` quark - counting '' diagrams has been given by lepage and brodsky  @xcite .",
    "a consequence , and direct test , of the factorization defining this mechanism is the hadron helicity conservation rule  @xcite @xmath4 where the @xmath5 s are the helicities of the participating hadrons in the reaction @xmath6 .",
    "the fact that this rule is badly violated in almost every case tested suggests two alternatives .",
    "one possibility , advocated by isgur and llewellyn - smith  @xcite , is that the energy and momentum transfer ( @xmath0 ) in the data is not large enough for the formalism to apply .",
    "however , the data also shows behavior close to the model s predicted power dependence on @xmath0 , indicating that hard scattering of a few pointlike quarks is being observed .",
    "the apparent contradiction has led to much discussion , and has even caused some authors to suggest that perturbative qcd itself might be wrong .",
    "the second alternative is that another power behaved process causing helicity flip is present . in fact",
    "the `` independent scattering '' subprocess , introduced by landshoff  @xcite , is actually the leading process at very high energies  @xcite .",
    "but it has been assumed that hadron helicity conservation would be the same in the independent scattering process as in the quark - counting one , since both involve exchange of hard gluons with large @xmath0 . in general",
    ", terms proportional to a quark mass , @xmath7 , for example , have been understood to cause helicity flip in either model , but with amplitude suppressed by a power of @xmath8 relative to the leading term .",
    "such terms seem to be quite small and are probably not a believable explanation of the persistent pattern of large violations of the helicity conservation rule .    here",
    "we show that the independent scattering mechanism predicts high - energy helicity _ non - conservation _ at a much higher rate .",
    "the calculations in momentum space are sufficiently complicated that this phenomenon has been overlooked for almost twenty years . adopting a transverse position space formalism introduced by botts and sterman  @xcite ,",
    "we show that the details rest on non - perturbative wave functions that should be _ measured _ rather than calculated .",
    "these wave functions measure non ",
    "zero orbital angular momentum not taken into account by short distance expansions .",
    "we argue that the novel factorization properties of independent scattering processes can not practically be reduced to the same ingredients used in the quark counting scattering . in any case , it is not necessary to flip a quark helicity : the new mechanism proceeds unimpeded in the limit of arbitrarily small quark mass and perfect chiral symmetry in the hard scattering .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we review the derivation of helicity conservation in genuine short distance processes .. in section  3 , we present the independent scattering mechanism with special emphasis on non - zero orbital angular momentum wave functions .",
    "we compute the contribution of these components to a helicity conserving reaction in section  4 , then to a helicity violating reaction in section  5 .",
    "these two sections contain our most important results at asymptotic and at accessible energies .",
    "section  6 is an experimental outlook .",
    "first we review the conventional derivation of hadron helicity conservation  @xcite .",
    "the quark - counting factorization introduces the distribution amplitude @xmath9  @xcite , an integral over the transverse momentum variables of the wave function for quarks to be found carrying momentum fraction @xmath10 in the hadron .",
    "introduced for renormalization group analysis in ref .",
    "either convention can be used without affecting our argument . ] for simplicity of presentation we specialize to a single pair of quarks , the meson case .",
    "let @xmath11 be a light cone wave function to find quarks with relative transverse momentum @xmath12 and light cone momentum fraction @xmath10 .",
    "in terms of the fourier conjugate transverse space variable @xmath13 separating the quarks , then @xmath14 in the second line we have expanded the wave function @xmath15 to exhibit the @xmath16 orbital angular momentum eigenvalues @xmath17 : a complete set for the ( nearly on - shell ) quarks consists of the @xmath18-axis orbital angular momentum , the energy , and the @xmath18-momentum .",
    "now suppose the distribution amplitude @xmath9 is assumed to be a good description of a process .",
    "then , whatever the angular momentum of the wave function , evaluating the integrals reveals the @xmath19 element is the sole surviving term in eq .",
    "( [ orbital ] ) : @xmath20 this shows that use of @xmath9 imposes two things : as @xmath21 the scattering region is both `` small '' , since the region @xmath22 dominates in the bessel function , and the scattering is `` round '' , _ i.e. _ cylindrically symmetric ( fig .  1 ) . in the absence of orbital angular momentum",
    ", the hadron helicity becomes the sum of the quark helicities .",
    "the quark helicities being conserved at leading order , the total hadron helicities are conserved . the hadron helicity conservation rule ( 1 ) therefore represents an exact _ symmetry _ of the quark - counting factorization .",
    "a crucial question is : does this symmetry of the model represent a property of the entire perturbative theory . or , can we simply assume `` s  wave '' @xmath16 wave functions to be the main contribution as in a non  relativistic picture ?",
    "the answer to both questions is _ no_. in general , quark wave functions themselves are not particularly restricted in orbital angular momentum content , even in the high energy limit .",
    "for example , in the pion ( pseudoscalar meson ) case the light - cone wave function may be expanded on four dirac tensors allowed by parity symmetry as @xmath23\\gamma_5\\right\\}_{\\alpha\\beta},\\ ] ] where @xmath24-@xmath25 are functions of the light cone fraction @xmath10 , the transverse separation @xmath13 and the total four momentum of the meson @xmath26 .",
    "for the moment we do not discuss dependence on gauge fixing and a path - ordered exponential of the gauge potential used to make the wave function gauge invariant .",
    "the @xmath25-term carries one unit of orbital angular momentum and yet scales with the same power of the `` big '' momentum @xmath27 as the @xmath24term , which is s - wave .",
    "since the @xmath25 term has a @xmath28 factor , which can be written in terms of @xmath29 this term represents one unit of orbital angular mometum . in terms of power counting , then , the @xmath30 and @xmath31 amplitudes can be equally large .",
    "we also note that wave functions are not objects to be derived in perturbation theory , but instead represent the long - time , non - perturbative time evolution proceeding inside a hadron .",
    "the non - perturbative hamiltonian of qcd does not conserve spin and orbital angular momentum separately , but instead generates mixing between orbital and spin angular momentum .",
    "finally , there is no simple relation between `` s  wave '' non  relativistic models of constituent quarks , and the pointlike quarks resolved in large@xmath0 collisions ,",
    "so no statement can reliably be made about quark angular momentum content of hadrons .",
    "thus _ if _ a non - zero orbital angular momentum component somehow enters the hard scattering  and this is a crucial point  _ then _ the long - time evolution before or after the scattering can convert this angular momentum into the observed hadron spin .",
    "it is not necessary to flip a quark spin in the hard interaction , because the asymptotic hadron spin fails to equal the sum of the quark spins .",
    "such a mechanism is totally consistent with the impulse approximation of perturbative qcd .",
    "the challenge in high energy hadron scattering is therefore to find those large @xmath0 process(es ) in which non - zero orbital angular momentum enters , or in other words , to find those which are not `` round '' .",
    "it turns out that in any treatment relevant to current energies the independent scattering process is not `` round '' but instead `` flat ''  ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the subprocess is highly asymmetric , showing an extreme dependence on the scattering plane . rather than disappearing in the high energy limit ,",
    "the dynamics of this process _ increases its asymmetry over a range of _ @xmath0 .",
    "the origin of the asymmetry is kinematic .",
    "let @xmath32 be the direction perpendicular to the scattering plane and @xmath33 be a vector in the scattering plane . in the independent scattering mechanism ,",
    "let two ( or more ) uncorrelated scattering planes be separated at the collision point by a transverse out  of  plane distance @xmath34 .",
    "going beams of quarks must coincide in direction well enough to make hadrons in the final state . conserving 4-momenta , for each pair of scatterings there are three delta functions of large momenta ( scaling like @xmath27 ) , and one delta function of the out - of plane transverse momentum , of the order of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 indicates a typical expectation value in the state .",
    "on  shell quark ",
    "quark scattering is dimensionless and scale invariant ( up to logarithmic corrections ) in qcd .",
    "the overall amplitude therefore scales like the product of these factors , namely like @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath0 power - counting of this argument is quite well - known ; what we emphasise here is the role of the scattering plane , namely the breaking of rotational symmetry with the out - of - plane direction @xmath32 .",
    "it is as if hadrons `` flatten '' under impact in the in - plane direction @xmath33 , forming a cigar - shaped hard scattering region  @xcite .",
    "this fact is very hard to see in covariant perturbation theory in momentum space , explaining why it has generally been overlooked .    the kinematic violation of hadron helicity conservation by independent scattering raises several new questions .",
    "it is clear that the usual association of leading  twist ( short  distance ) and large @xmath0 either breaks down or hinges on delicate dynamical details .",
    "our approach will exploit the fact that leading approximations to any kinematically distinct amplitude are always perturbatively calculable .",
    "for example , higher order corrections of non  leading twist type in the distibution amplitude formalism can not violate the hadron helicity conservation symmetry and will not affect our approach .",
    "the first non  vanishing contributions to helicity violating amplitudes involve extra partons in the short distance formalism .",
    "a gluon embedded in the hard scattering , for example , could transfer spin to an outgoing hadron .",
    "we need not consider such processes , because , as discussed later , they are subleading by a power of @xmath0 and perturbatively small since such gluons are `` hard '' .",
    "it remains to be shown , of course , that helicity violation from independent scattering is not suppressed by the same order .",
    "that is the main technical task of this paper .",
    "botts and sterman have considered  @xcite the generic `` elastic '' reaction @xmath38 , where @xmath39 s are light pseudoscalar mesons , at high energy @xmath40 and large angle center of mass scattering angle @xmath41 .",
    "their study has shown that the reaction is dominated by the 2 independent scatterings of the valence constituents with a kinematical configuration depicted in fig .  2 .",
    "one has two scattering planes separated at the collision point by a transverse distance @xmath42 .    to make it clear , let us consider a light cone basis @xmath43 attached to each meson @xmath39 , and chosen so that , in the center of mass frame where @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 in the cm frame , one has @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "each bethe - salpeter amplitude @xmath49 @xmath50 is assumed to eliminate @xmath51 configuration with relative @xmath52 transverse momentum ( along @xmath53 and @xmath32 ) . the relative minus momentum ( along @xmath54 )",
    "is of @xmath55 .",
    "then , momentum transfers in @xmath56 or @xmath57 are dominated by large invariants built with @xmath58-terms and a first approximation is to neglect all but these components of the quark or antiquark momenta , in the hard amplitudes @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this is the impulse approximation .",
    "a second observation follows from kinematics ; although momentum conservation at the hard scattering @xmath56 relates the internal momentum dependence of the @xmath59 s , a variation of one such momentum @xmath60 in its @xmath53 or @xmath54 direction induces negligible modifications in the three other @xmath59 s .",
    "consequently , momentum components of @xmath60 along @xmath53 or @xmath61 only appear as a relevant variable in the wave function @xmath49 and integrals over these components can be carried out .",
    "the components along @xmath32 , denoted @xmath62 , represent transverse momentum out of the scattering plane and do not share the same property .",
    "thus , the vertex delta function may be reexpressed as @xmath63 which indicates that the 4 constituents which enter or leave each hard scattering carry the same light cone fraction ( @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) . introducing the",
    "`` out of plane '' impact parameter @xmath42 through @xmath66 one may write the amplitude of the process  @xcite as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the amplitude @xmath69 with dirac indices @xmath70 .",
    "color indices are suppressed in eq .",
    "( [ a0 ] ) and sums over repeated indices are understood .",
    "we consider unflavored quarks .",
    "the implementation of flavor is straightforward by setting to 0 some of the graphs we are going to consider .",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are feynman amplitudes ( a sum over allowed diagrams is understood ) at the level of quarks computed with standard perturbative qcd vertices and internal propagators ; they consist , at lowest order in the coupling constant , of one - gluon exchange or @xmath51 annihilation for each quark pair .",
    "note that @xmath68 and @xmath56 are not individually gauge invariant .",
    "if the short  distance @xmath71 limit is assumed , then the four general wave functions in eq .",
    "( [ pion ] ) can be reduced to one @xmath24term , by taking the trace @xmath72 of @xmath73 with @xmath74 . for the case of helicity conserving amplitudes , this selection was shown to be self ",
    "consistent by botts and sterman@xcite .",
    "then , the zeroth moment of @xmath72 is related to the decay constant of the corresponding meson @xmath75 where , _",
    "e.g. _ for the pion , @xmath76 .",
    "this zero  distance quantity contains no information on the interesting dependence on the transverse variable @xmath42 .",
    "here we are concerned with the leading order description of helicity violating terms .",
    "thus , we will consider @xmath24type and @xmath25type amplitudes on an equal footing , and make no a priori assumption that the region @xmath71 dominates .",
    "the development so far has been sufficient to isolate the kinematic region of interest , which as we have already noted is characterized by finite separation between the participating quarks in the out - of scattering plane direction .",
    "the amplitude is thus a strong function of the spatial dependence of the wave function .",
    "the bethe salpeter wave function is a bilocal matrix element and is not gauge invariant .",
    "however , we will now discuss how gauge invariance of the description can be obtained .",
    "the key is in how the perturbation theory is re - arranged . in the sterman and botts factorization",
    "certain `` soft '' corrections are put into the wave functions , leaving other parts of feynman diagrams to go into the hard scattering kernel . in dressing the wave function in this way ,",
    "it is no longer a quark correlation ( the bethe salpeter wave function ) , but the matrix elements of operators determined by the types of diagrams put in .",
    "the operators chosen in  @xcite are path ordered exponentials ( poe s ) , shown by collins and soper  @xcite to be the generators of eikonal approximations to the gluon attachments .",
    "the poe s are gauge covariant , leading to a gauge invariant amplitude .",
    "this is partly forced by physics , and partly a convention . as a convention for the perturbation theory ,",
    "subsequent diagrams must be evaluated with subtractions to avoid double - counting .",
    "more generally , any operator functional of the @xmath77 fields which transforms properly could serve in place of the poe s , and creating a different subtraction procedure .",
    "let us extract what we can that is independent of convention .",
    "let the operator in the definition of the wave functions be called @xmath78 ; we will call it a gauge - dressing operator . under a gauge transformation at the position @xmath10 , we require @xmath78 to transform like an antiquark",
    ". then products such as @xmath79 are gauge invariant .",
    "that is , we have gauge invariant matrix elements to find a dressed quark @xmath80    it is obvious that this requirement does not determine @xmath78 uniquely , because one could always attach a factor which is gauge invariant without changing the gauge transformation properties .",
    "the particular choice of what to attach is a prescription , _",
    "i.e. _ a definition of what parts of the amplitude will be put in the wave function and what in the hard scattering , and it can not be determined by gauge invariance alone .",
    "however , due to gauge transformations one must attach some kind of gauge - dressing operator to have a well defined matrix elements .",
    "although the standard way to do gauge dressing with the poe is path dependent , no path dependence generally need be associated with @xmath78 and in particular the observable process does not determine or favor any path .",
    "this important point can be seen with an elementary example from qed , where the @xmath81 gauge invariance is easier to control .",
    "the straightforward qed analogue of our process involves equal time ( not light cone time ) correlation functions in the gauge @xmath82 .",
    "this gauge choice eliminates a mode , but there still remains a lack of definition of the coordinates due to time independent gauge transformations @xmath83",
    "@xmath84    this produces a change in the longitudinal modes .",
    "these modes are sometimes also called unphysical , a very unfortunate choice of terminology . in free space and in the absence of coupling a gauge theory",
    "has two transverse degrees of freedom and the third would be called unphysical .",
    "however we are interested in the case that matter fields exist ( and the non - abelian coupling is turned on ) in which case the third mode is real , but special inasmuch as being constrained in terms of the other variables by gauge invariance . to see this , note that we can decompose into transverse and longitudinal parts , @xmath85(x )       \\hskip .25 in \\;\\hbox{(transforming part ) } \\nonumber\\\\ { \\bf a}_t & = & { \\bf a } -   \\nabla\\phi \\hskip .75in\\;\\hbox{(invariant part).}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since it is there for gauge transformations , the longitudinal part @xmath86 is not free to be varied in arbitrary dynamical ways , but must accompany the matter field in a prescribed , unique functional . at time @xmath87",
    "this operator is @xmath88 from which one can verify that under a gauge transformation , @xmath89    we will call this the coulomb dressing because it creates a classical coulomb field around the matter particle , as the reader can check by calculation . since the hamiltonian commutes with the gauge transformation operator once @xmath82 has been set , the time evolution will maintain the invariance of the combination @xmath90 .",
    "however , as noted already , one is not forced to accept this as the unique answer , but can opt for @xmath91 , which will transform in the same way for any @xmath92 .",
    "the reader may still be curious to know the relation between coulomb dressing and the poe approach .",
    "this can be very simply exhibited by noting that @xmath93    this expression is still path independent .",
    "this is the choice @xmath94 .",
    "a different choice is @xmath95 in which case we have @xmath96 which is the standard path dependent poe .",
    "both procedures are equally acceptable , as far as satisfying gauge invariance , but the path ordered exponential can create a line of physical transverse gauge field particles between the charged matter fields , depending on how it is oriented .",
    "such a line of gluons , existing only along the chosen part , can be interpreted as an arbitrary model for the transverse gauge field inside the state of interest .",
    "similarly , if one boosts the coulomb dressed definition , the boost also creates a blast of transverse gauge fields as seen by the `` equivalent photon '' approximation .    in perturbation theory ,",
    "the lowest order approximation to non - abelian dressing is the abelian case .",
    "it is possible in the non - abelian theory to write down expressions analogous to the coulomb dressing but care must be used to keep track of the color indices .",
    "it is equally valid to use poe s , which definitely transform properly , as building blocks to generate an infinite number of different ways to dress the quarks .",
    "the different choices are not relevant for a leading order calculation to which we restrict this study .",
    "the next crucial step is to elaborate a factorized form for the amplitude , whose prototype is eq .",
    "( [ a0 ] ) , regarding radiative corrections . generalizing the results of @xcite to the case of the helicity  violating dirac projections",
    ", a leading approximation to the soft region rearranges these corrections to obtain the following expression @xmath97 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are evaluated at respective scales @xmath98 and @xmath99 which are assumed to be large .",
    "large logarithmic corrections to the process , with the coexistence of the two scales @xmath100 and @xmath101 , are resummed in @xmath102 , in such a way that @xmath103 is now a soft object : it does not include perturbative corrections harder than @xmath101 .",
    "it is the non perturbative object necessary to connect short and long range physics , both present in hard hadronic processes .",
    "expressions for the above quantities will be given in the phenomenological study , but let us specify here some of their qualitative features .",
    "when @xmath42 is small , smaller or of the order of @xmath104 , radiative corrections are also small and must be considered as perturbative corrections to the hard amplitudes @xmath56 or @xmath57 ; in this regime , @xmath103 is closely related to the distribution amplitude @xmath105 evaluated at the renormalization scale @xmath106  @xcite . depending on the definition ,",
    "the distribution amplitude also includes resummed logarithmic corrections from hadronic scale up to @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath42 is large , this replacement is not legitimate but since @xmath108 is a strong suppression factor in this region the exact value of @xmath103 is irrelevant .",
    "endpoints in the @xmath10 integral where hard subprocesses would indeed become soft may look problematic .",
    "both the distribution amplitude and wave function approaches used here become self  consistent because of the end ",
    "point zeroes , e.g. @xmath109 , where @xmath110 which should occur independently of spin projection .",
    "before analyzing helicity violating processes let us examine the leading contribution from the various components in eq .  ( [ pion ] ) to a standard helicity conserving reaction such as @xmath111 .      in their study , botts and sterman were interested in identifying the asymptotic behavior of the amplitude @xmath112 ( @xmath113 fixed ) .",

    "the ratio modified by such a factor is shown in fig .  4 as a shaded area limited by the curves corresponding to @xmath188 and @xmath189 ; this measures in some way the theoretical uncertainty on p - wave contribution suppression .",
    "further theoretical progress in the computation of these @xmath190 terms will allow to get rid of this uncertainty but we do not tackle this task here .    a third effect may come from the intrinsic transverse dependence of the wave function . while the replacement of @xmath191 by @xmath192 discussed in section  3.1",

    "the results are modified as depicted in fig .  5 where the curves from this wave function and from the asymptotic distribution are shown for comparison .",

    "to begin with , let us find the possible tensorial decomposition for the quark antiquark wavefunctions of the @xmath205 meson .",
    "one specifies a one particle state by the momentum @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) , which with the notation of section  3 , one can write : @xmath208 ( m is the @xmath205 mass which we do not neglect for the moment ) , and by the helicity @xmath209 .",
    "the 3 helicity states are described in a covariant way with the help of the 3 vectors @xmath210 , satisfying @xmath211 and @xmath212 . for @xmath213",
    ", @xmath214 is a direct trihedral , and we choose @xmath215 a consistent choice for @xmath216 is @xmath217    thus , demanding a parity @xmath218 state , the bethe - salpeter amplitude has the most general dirac - matrices expansion @xmath219+{\\cal p}'_0\\,/\\!\\!\\!\\varepsilon_h+ { \\cal p}_1\\,\\varepsilon_h.b\\,/\\!\\!\\!p+{\\cal p}'_1\\,\\varepsilon_h.b+ \\tilde{\\cal p}_1\\,[/\\!\\!\\!\\varepsilon_h,/\\!\\!\\!p]\\,/\\!\\!\\!b+ \\tilde{\\cal p}'_1\\,[/\\!\\!\\!\\varepsilon_h,/\\!\\!\\!b]+ { \\cal p}_2\\,\\varepsilon_h.b\\,[/\\!\\!\\!p,/\\!\\!\\!b]+ { \\cal p}'_2\\,\\varepsilon_h.b\\,/\\!\\!\\!b.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can then extract the relevant components for the study of independent scattering processes .",
    "that is , we isolate dominant high - energy tensors , those which contain one power of the large scale @xmath100 and we restrict to @xmath220 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath221 in the notation of section  3.1 ) .",

    "double - flip _ rule .",
    "it follows from the property of each dominant component that each power of @xmath42 changes the chirality ( which is @xmath224 if the component anticommutes with @xmath225 and @xmath218 if it commutes ) . with vector gluon couplings",
    ", it follows that if the process is allowed by hadron helicity conservation , chiral symmetry requires that the @xmath42-components occur in pairs . with respect to the short distance contribution from valence states .",
    "however the chirality of the component is the same as the p - wave we are considering ( that is opposite to the s - wave ) . the above argument then applies to ensure that when p - waves and one - gluon components are likely to compete , at least 2 such components are necessary : from section  4 , one counts @xmath226 for one p - wave and @xmath227 for one extra gluon ; this shows that considering one extra gluon in the fock state is indeed subdominant with respect to considering a p - wave state .",
    "] we have already encountered this property in the @xmath228 elastic scattering .",
    "furthermore , for an helicity 0-state , in both pseudoscalar and vector case , the chirality of the s - wave term is positive , whereas for an helicity odd state , it is negative . then with chiral symmetry and because the total power of @xmath42 has to be",
    "even , one concludes that the number of helicity-0 states has to be even too . for a 2 to 2 process ,",
    "only those processes that violate the helicity conservation rule by two units are expected to be non - zero in the present framework and hence important at large energy .",
    "an example of interaction which satisfies neither the helicity conservation rule nor the double - flip rule is @xmath229 such an amplitude is thus vanishing by power counting .",
    "we then turn to the study of an helicity violating process which , however , satisfies the double - flip rule , namely @xmath230 .",
    "let us first verify of the vanishing of the hard amplitude using the s - wave components of the external mesons .",
    "for this purpose , it is instructive to examine the connection between quark helicities and the s - wave dirac tensors we have used until now .",
    "this is accomplished in the following way .",
    "one considers the free massless spinors of a quark and an antiquark moving in the same direction , the quark having a momentum @xmath231 and the antiquark a momentum @xmath232 , so that the compound system has a momentum @xmath233 .",
    "then one constructs the four possible helicity states of the system with solutions of the dirac equation and finds @xmath234    the helicity conservation rule is then easily verified with these combinations of spinor when one chooses the chiral representation  @xcite . in this representation ,",
    "the 2 diagonal blocks of each @xmath235 are equal to the null 2@xmath2362 matrix .",
    "a feynman - graph fermion line , with vector ( or axial ) couplings and massless propagator , is an even number of @xmath133matrices between two spinors : @xmath237 inclusions of @xmath225 , which is diagonal in this representation , do not modify this property .",
    "then , since to order @xmath238 the chirality of a spinor corresponds to the helicity of the state and , in this representation , chiral eigenstate spinors have either their 2 first components or their two last equal to 0 , states of different helicity always give a null product .",
    "this property is algebraic and therefore independent of the representation chosen .",
    "however , it is more difficult to observe its effects in the trace formalism described in section 2 .",
    "let us examine how it works in the case of the reaction considered . among the twelve graphs discussed in section  2 ,",
    "each @xmath239 and @xmath240 graph is 0 because they contain traces over the product of an odd number of @xmath235 matrices .",
    "for the 8 remaining graphs , the sequence @xmath241 occurs ( the anticommutation to the left of every @xmath225 is understood and does not modify the reasoning ) .",
    "the product of an odd number of @xmath235 being a linear combination of @xmath235 and @xmath242 , one is left with the evaluation of @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath245 have been used and the index 3 dropped .",
    "one can decompose each @xmath235 onto @xmath246 , which are such that their square is 0 and their anticommutation rules are @xmath247 to conclude that all graphs effectively vanish .    adding the contribution from one p - wave function does not give any contribution ( even before the integration over @xmath42 ) , because the total number of @xmath235 is necessarily odd .",
    "the first non zero term is therefore a @xmath135 hard amplitude @xmath248 and the computation , within the approximation of section  4.2 , leads to @xmath249 this amplitude @xmath248 has to be supplemented with @xmath102 ( eq .",
    "( [ ull ] ) ) and integrated over @xmath42 and @xmath10 .",
    "even though this combination involves several unknown objects , one notices that the angular dependence varies from one component to another and is rather different from the one obtained in @xmath228 elastic scattering .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to analyze the contribution to helicity violation processes from different wave functions and use this information to deduce properties of the wave functions .",
    "the numerical study of section  4 can then be used to understand the energy dependence of double helicity violating processes at accessible energies .",
    "as explicitly shown in fig .",
    "4a and 5 , the naive @xmath182 factor is replaced by a milder suppression , and this is primarily due to the specificity of the independent scattering mechanism supplemented by sudakov effects . even at very large energies",
    "the @xmath250 ratio of eq .",
    "( [ ras ] ) looks quite weak a suppression .",
    "studying meson - meson scattering is an unrealistic simplifying assumption . including baryons is a necessary but quite intricate further step , because of the high number of feynman diagrams and internal degrees of freedom to be integrated over when more valence quarks are involved .",
    "we can however still draw some conclusions from our analysis , leaving to future work a comprehensive study .",
    "the mechanism we have explored occurs in several experimentally accessible circumstances .",
    "indeed , there is a host of reactions involving hadronic helicity violation from which we could learn about the interface of perturbative and non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the helicity density matrix of the @xmath205 meson produced in @xmath251 at 90@xmath252 is a nice measure of helicity violating components .",
    "experimental data  @xcite yield @xmath253 , at @xmath254gev@xmath3 , @xmath255 , for the non - diagonal helicity violating matrix element . without entering a detailed phenomenological analysis",
    ", we may use the results of section  5 through the following line of reasoning . assuming that the presence of the third valence quark , which is not subject to a third independent scattering , does not alter much the results",
    ", one may view @xmath256 as coming from the interference of an helicity conserving amplitude like @xmath257 with a double helicity flip amplitude like @xmath230 .",
    "we then get a mild energy dependence of this matrix element",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath250 ( eq .",
    "( [ ras ] ) ) at asymptotic energies or as shown in fig .",
    "4a and fig .  5 at accessible energies .",
    "this is at variance with the picture emerging from the diquark model  @xcite .",
    "measuring the energy dependence of this effect is thus highly interesting .",
    "the most well - known example of hadron helicity violation occurs in @xmath258 scattering  @xcite .",
    "our demonstration of helicity violating contributions to meson - meson scattering has a bearing on this , because generalized meson scattering is embedded in the diagrams for proton scattering . without needing to make any dynamical assumption of `` diquarks '' ,",
    "the perturbative qcd diagrams for @xmath258 scattering contain numerous diquark regions , convolved with scattering of an extra quark .",
    "there is no known selection rule which would prevent the scattering of such a subprocess with helicity flip from causing helicity flip in pp elastic scattering .",
    "this does not exhaust the possibilities , because there are other channels of momentum flow and color combinatorics which might have different interpretations .",
    "the data for @xmath258 also reveals large oscillations about power - law behavior , a second piece of evidence that the short distance picture is inadequate .",
    "elsewhere  @xcite we have identified these oscillations as a sign of independent scattering . given the theoretical  @xcite and experimental evidence , we therefore find no evidence that hadronic helicity conservation is a feature of perturbative qcd , and we believe that independent scattering is a main contender in explaining the observations .",
    "since reactions of baryons are extremely complicated , and next to nothing is known about the various wave functions in the proton , a productive approach to the question is to ask for experimental circumstances in which the general mechanism we have outlined could be tested without requiring too much detail .",
    "we believe that progress here will come from using nuclear targets , and studying the phenomenon of color transparency in hard ( as opposed to diffractive ) reactions .",
    "this program has been outlined elsewhere  @xcite ; it suffices to mention here that suppression of large @xmath135 regions is expected in reactions of large nuclei .",
    "it follows that helicity conservation should be obtained in the same circumstances .",
    "thus the mechanism we have outlined is testable .",
    "it is time to go beyond the short - distance physics used to establish qcd as the correct theory , and we believe that a multitude of phenomena involving spin , color transparency , and detailed hadron structure , will play a major role in the future .    * acknowledgments * : this work was supported in part under doe grant number de fg02 85 er 40214 and the kansas institute for theoretical and computational science , and by the eec program `` human capital and mobility '' , network `` physics at high energy colliders '' , contract chrx  ct930357 .",
