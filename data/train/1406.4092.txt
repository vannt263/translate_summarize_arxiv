    "much has been written about traversable wormholes - the short - cut hypothetical channels - between distant points of the same or different universes .",
    "a safe passage is assumed provided the tunnel resists against collapse for a considerable time .",
    "repulsion against gravitational collapse is provided by a negative energy density which is absent in large amounts in our world .",
    "although at atomic scales quantum theory comes to our rescue such scales are for elementary particles / photons , not for humans .",
    "let us add that modified einstein theories admit wormholes which are supported by normal , non - exotic matter .",
    "the difficulty is to find similar objects in the simplest theory of gravity , namely einstein s general relativity .",
    "exploring such structures relies on our understanding of the physics of the tunnel and its narrowest surface : the throat .",
    "it was suggested first by morris and thorne @xcite that the minimal @xmath0dimensional surface of the throat must satisfy the flare - out conditions .",
    "this ensured connection to distant points provided the points belong to asymptotically flat universes .",
    "this is an ideal case which can be relaxed , i.e. even for non - asymptotically flat spaces construction of wormholes may be taken for granted .",
    "the flare - out conditions for a throat set by morris and thorne @xcite were generalized by hochberg and visser @xcite . in the latter , known as the generalized morris - thorne flare - out conditions they employ the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath1 and its trace , @xmath2 for @xmath3 , the @xmath0dimensional geometry of the throat . in brief",
    "it states that the area of the throat @xmath4 satisfies both @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the minimality requirement .",
    "these amount to @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the normal direction @xmath9 to the @xmath0dimensional geometry of the throat .",
    "we show in this brief report that the generalized morris - thorne flare - out conditions introduced for a wormhole are not applicable to a thin - shell wormhole ( tsw ) which is constructed by the cut - and - paste technique . for this purpose",
    "we split the geometry in gaussian normal coordinates into @xmath10 and apply the israel junction conditions @xcite .",
    "the very existence of surface energy density @xmath11 at the junction of the tsw violates @xmath7 condition but yet the minimality of the area can be preserved .",
    "this is not as a result of a mathematical proof but rather as a requirement to define the existence of a throat .",
    "the distinction can be seen in fig . 1 , between a normal wormhole and a tsw .",
    "in the latter case the lack of smoothness at the throat prevents the metric functions to admit continuous derivatives . for the tsw",
    "we proceed to propose the condition @xmath12 irrespective of the minimality of area .",
    "this yields further that the surface energy - density @xmath11 can locally be negative / positive , but more importantly its total ( i.e. the integral of @xmath13 ) , which matters physically may turn out to be positive .",
    "this is shown by application to the non - spherical zipoy - voorhees ( zv ) @xcite metric through numerical plots for tuned parameters .",
    "hochberg and visser , @xcite , generalized the minimal area condition for wormholes given previously by morris and thorne in @xcite . based on hv an arbitrary static spacetime ( which is supposed to be a wormhole )",

    "let s consider an arbitrary static @xmath22dimensional spacetime of the form@xmath23we note that here in ( 4 ) @xmath24 may have root(s ) or not and if yes , we call @xmath25 to be the largest root , or event horizon . then we use the standard method of making tsw @xcite .",
    "the throat is located at the hypersurface @xmath26 where @xmath27 can be only one of the possible spatial coordinates . without loss of generality we set @xmath28 and the line element of the throat reads as@xmath29 in which @xmath30 the full line element of the throat in a tsw , by definition , is in the form of the gaussian normal coordinates @xcite and therefore the area of the throat is given by ( 2 ) .",
    "having minimum spatial area for the throat , hence , requires the same procedure as introduced in @xcite i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 which ultimately end up with the same conditions as the ordinary wormholes i.e. , @xmath7 and @xmath33 further study on tsws , however , manifests that unlike the case of an ordinary wormhole spacetime , in tsw we are allowed to have some matter sources on the throat .",
    "the matter supporting the throat should satisfy the standard israel junction conditions israel or einstein equations on the throat@xmath34 in which @xmath35 stands for a jump across the hypersurface @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39diag@xmath40 with @xmath41 the @xmath42 which must be zero is just the trace of spatial part of the extrinsic curvature tensor ( 6 ) which corresponds to the space part of eq .",

    "simply means that the generalized morris - thorne flare - out conditions are not applicable to the tsw .",
    "however the latter condition does not change the applicability of the original morris - thorne s minimality conditions . in fig .",
    "1 we see the implication of @xmath57 for a tsw , since derivatives of the metric function are not continuous at the throat .",
    "let us add that @xmath7 also indirectly stands for the ordinary wormholes whose throat surfaces trivially have no external energy - momenta .",
    "based on what we found , for the tsws in general @xmath57 while the area of the throat can still be minimum .",

    "for instance , one of the cases in @xcite is the straight cosmic string with @xmath80 and @xmath81 with @xmath82 which is not zero but positive .",

    "the generalized morris - thorne flare - out conditions , i.e. @xmath100 and @xmath101 proposed for general wormholes are weakened for the case of tsws .",
    "this is necessary due to the fact that on the tsw at the throat we have a surface energy - density @xmath55 .",
