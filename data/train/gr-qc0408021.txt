    "in recent years there has been much interest in braneworld scenarios  @xcite , where our four dimensional universe could be a brane embedded in a higher dimensional bulk spacetime .",
    "the basic ingredient of braneworld scenarios is that while ordinary matter fields are confined to the brane , only gravitational interactions can propagate in the bulk .",
    "the second randall - sundrum model ( rs ii )  @xcite with one brane in an anti de sitter ( ads ) bulk is particularly interesting in the point that , despite an infinite extra dimension , four dimensional general relativity ( 4d gr ) can be recovered at low energies / long distances on the brane . then , what is leading order corrections to the conventional gravitational theory ? it was shown that the newtonian potential in the rs ii braneworld , including the correction due to the bulk gravitational effects with a precise numerical factor  @xcite , is given by @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the curvature length of the ads space and is experimentally constrained to be @xmath2 mm .",
    "it is natural to ask next what are leading order corrections to cosmological perturbations .",
    "great efforts have been paid for the problem of calculating cosmological perturbations in braneworld scenarios ( see , for example , refs .  ) . in order to correctly evaluate perturbations on the brane , we need to solve bulk perturbations , which reduces to a problem of solving partial differential equations with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "hence it is not as easy as in the standard four dimensional cosmology .",
    "a pure de sitter braneworld  @xcite , and its variations such as `` junction '' models  @xcite and a special dilatonic braneworld  @xcite are the rare examples where the bulk perturbations are analytically solved . in more generic cases , one has to resort to a numerical calculation  @xcite , or some approximate methods  @xcite .",
    "there is another difficulty concerned with a physical , fundamental aspect of the problem ; we do not know how to specify appropriate initial conditions for perturbations with bulk degrees of freedom .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate cosmological tensor perturbations in the rs ii braneworld , and try to evaluate leading order corrections to the 4d gr result analytically . for this purpose",
    ", we make use of the reduction scheme to a four dimensional effective equation which iteratively takes into account the effects of the bulk gravitational fields  @xcite . as a first step , we concentrate on perturbations which is initially at a super - horizon scale .",

    "ii we define the setup of the problem discussed in the present paper more precisely . in sec .",
    "iii we briefly review the derivation of the effective equation of motion for tensor perturbations . in sec .",
    "iv , using the long wavelength approximation we develop a method for evaluating leading order corrections , and evaluate the corrections considering slow - roll inflation and the radiation stage which follows after inflation .",
    "the shortcoming of the long wavelength approximation is cured by introducing another method suitable for analyzing the radiation phase in sec .",
    "section v is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in this paper we investigate tensor perturbations in a friedmann braneworld model with an warped ( infinite ) extra dimension  @xcite . to determine the spectrum of tensor perturbations observed at late time , we need to solve the perturbation equations with appropriate initial conditions .",
    "however , it is not an easy task to specify what initial conditions we should use in the context of braneworld cosmology . at an earlier stage of the evolution of the universe",
    "the physical wavelength of perturbation modes is much shorter than the bulk curvature scale .",
    "then , the correction to the four dimensional standard evolution will not remain small .",
    "therefore , in this regime it is not appropriate to discuss the dynamics of perturbation modes under the assumption that a modification to the four dimensional standard one is small .",
    "hence our strategy is to isolate the issue of initial conditions from the rest . in this paper",
    "we discuss a relatively easy part , _",
    "i.e. _ , late time evolution after the effect of the fifth dimension becomes perturbative .",
    "our discussion will be restricted to the perturbation modes whose wavelength is initially much longer than the hubble horizon scale .",
    "we analytically derive a formula for small corrections to the solution for the tensor perturbation equation due to the presence of the fifth dimension .",

    "therefore , it is manifest that when we integrate @xmath182 the dominant contribution comes from around the lower boundary of the integral , @xmath183 , and so corrections arising in the sub - horizon regime are suppressed compared to those imprinted beforehand in the super - horizon regime .",
    "a similar expression for @xmath184 can be obtained as @xmath185 \\left [ \\frac{3}{\\eta^3 } | \\uz ' |^2 + \\left(-\\frac{3}{\\eta^4}+\\frac{k^2}{\\eta^2}\\right)(\\uz')^*\\uz \\right ] + \\mbox{c.c.}. \\label{u - s_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term is local and suppressed for large @xmath15 for the same reason above . to examine the late time behavior of the first term",

    "this approximation is justified because the kernel @xmath186 decays at least as fast as @xmath187 for a large time separation , as will be shown in appendix . under this approximation for @xmath188 , it is easy to calculate its fourier transform , the fourier transform of @xmath188 changes by a constant independent of @xmath136 .",

    "the dominant contribution in the integration of @xmath194 therefore comes from around the lower boundary of the integral .    based on the above analysis",
    ", we conclude that all the dominant corrections arise in the super - horizon regime , and thus it is sufficient to evaluate the corrections in the long wavelength approximation .",
    "we have investigated leading order corrections to the tensor perturbations in the rs ii braneworld cosmology by using the perturbative expansion scheme of ref .",
    "we have studied a model composed of slow - roll inflation on the brane , followed by a radiation dominant era .",
    "the unperturbed five dimensional bulk is ads space with curvature radius @xmath1 . in our expansion scheme the asymptotic boundary conditions in the bulk are imposed by choosing outgoing solutions of bulk perturbations , whose general expression is known in the poincar coordinate system .",
    "hence , the issue of bulk boundary conditions is handled without introducing an artificial regulator brane .",
    "this is one of the notable advantages of the present scheme .",
    "we set the initial condition when the wave length @xmath195 is already longer than the hubble radius during slow - roll inflation .",
    "we will not lose much by neglecting the modes which are already inside the hubble scale at the time of transition to the radiation era , since they are not cosmologically so interesting .",
    "we compared the resulting amplitudes of fluctuations after the horizon re - entry with and without the effect of an extra dimension .",
    "to do so , we normalized the amplitude so that the late time amplitude of fluctuations becomes identical in two cases if the slow - roll inflation lasts forever .",
    "as the reference without the effect of an extra dimension , we took a growing mode solution .",
    "the corrections due to gravity propagation through the fifth dimension dominantly come from the contribution around the transition time",
    ". therefore they can be estimated by using the long wavelength approximation with a sufficient accuracy .",
    "since the correction due to the modified cosmic expansion comes from relatively late epoch , it is necessary to take into account the oscillatory behavior of the solution after the re - entry to the hubble horizon .    combining the results obtained in eqs .",
    "( [ corr_from_local ] ) , ( [ f2fin ] ) and ( [ f0fin ] ) , we find that the amplitude of a fluctuation with comoving wave number @xmath34 is modified by a factor @xmath196}$ ] due to the effect of an extra dimension with @xmath197= \\frac{k^2\\ell^2}{a_0 ^ 2}\\left\\ { \\frac{13}{150}-\\frac{4}{15}\\left[\\gamma+\\ln\\left ( \\frac{k}{a_0h_0 } \\right)\\right ] + \\frac{2}{5}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\ell h_0}{2}\\right ) \\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath198 and @xmath199 are the scale factor and the hubble parameter at the transition time , and @xmath39 is the euler s constant .",
    "leading corrections are proportional to @xmath200 or @xmath201 , as is expected from the dimensional analysis . however , our calculation here determined the precise numerical factors analytically .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we have dropped the contribution from the decaying mode for simplicity . since the decaying mode during the initial slow - roll inflation phase",
    "is usually suppressed when the wavelength is longer than the hubble scale , it does not give a significant effect .",
    "however , in the context of braneworld , we have not yet understood how to fix the initial conditions for fluctuations .",
    "therefore , in principle , there is a possibility that the contamination of the decaying mode can be extremely large , although it seems quite unlikely .",
    "in such a case the contribution from the decaying component can not be neglected .",
    "it is quite easy to estimate the leading order correction due to the decaying mode , since it does not pick up the effect of the presence of an extra dimension . here",
    "the effect is not due to the non - trivial evolution of a solution but totally due to unconventional initial condition . adding a decaying mode",
    "will modify @xmath202 given in eq .",
    "( [ dsmodefunc ] ) to @xmath203 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath204 is a complex number which parametrizes the amplitude of the decaying component . repeating a similar calculation leading to eq .",
    "( [ f0fin ] ) , we find that the relative change in the amplitude due to the decaying mode is given by @xmath205 { \\ell^2 h_0 ^ 2\\over 2}(k\\eta_0)^3.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the correction due to the decaying component is more suppressed in the sense of the power of @xmath34 , but it might be more important than the other corrections for @xmath206^{-1}$ ] if @xmath207 $ ] is extremely large .",
    "lastly we would like to mention the limitation of the present work and some future issues .",
    "the perturbative expansion scheme that we have adopted in this paper is valid for scales larger than the ads curvature length ( @xmath208 ) at low energies ( @xmath13 ) ; besides our study is restricted to initially super - horizon perturbations .",
    "we gave an initial condition for a solution by hand , but of course such an approach is not satisfactory . to determine the initial condition , we need to investigate the evolution of perturbations at the initial phase where the wavelength of the mode is too short and reduction to an effective four dimensional problem is not possible .",
    "furthermore , to seek for interesting effects that might arise at high energies ( @xmath209 ) , we have to develop a new formalism , which is a next challenge and will be hopefully reported in our future publication .",
    "we are grateful to shinji mukohyama and roy maartens for useful discussions .",
    "this work is supported in part by monbukagakusho grant - in - aid nos .",
    "16740141 and 14047212 , inamori foundation , and 21coe program at kyoto university `` center for diversity and universality in physics '' .",
    "in this appendix , we will show the following formula : @xmath210 + \\gamma\\delta ( t ) \\right\\ } , \\label{app_formula}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath211 and @xmath39 is euler s constant .",
    "the branch cuts are all running on the lower half complex plane of @xmath136 ( fig.[fig : cont1.eps ] ) , which ensures the retarded boundary conditions .",
    "we divide the above integration into two parts : @xmath212 the first term of the right hand side can be rewritten as @xmath213.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integration can be performed as @xmath214 \\\\ & = & -2\\pi \\theta(t)\\frac{e^{-ikt}}{t},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the other two integrals are obtained by setting @xmath215 and @xmath174 .",
    "thus we have @xmath216 this expression is regular at @xmath217 . to evaluate the second term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ app_two_parts ] ) , we need a trick because the integrand suffers from a slow fall - off at large values of @xmath218 .",
    "it should be interpreted as @xmath219 = 2 i \\partial_t \\left\\ { \\theta(t)\\left [ \\int d\\lambda\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}}{\\lambda}\\left ( \\ln(- \\lambda ) - \\ln ( kt)\\right ) \\right]\\right\\ } , \\label{app_lambda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we put @xmath220 .",
    "now the branch cut and the contour of the integration on @xmath221 plane are such shown in fig  [ fig : cont2.eps ] . thanks to this trick , the expression for the second term becomes a well - defined one , though the result does not change as long as convergence is guaranteed .",
    "then , performing the integration as @xmath222 + 2\\pi i \\ln(kt ) \\\\ & = & 2\\pi i \\left [ \\ln ( kt ) + \\gamma \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we finally obtain the formula  ( [ app_formula ] ) .",
    "for @xmath145 the formula  ( [ app_formula ] ) reduces to @xmath223 and hence the kernel that appears in @xmath61 becomes @xmath224 , \\qquad \\mbox{for}~~t>0 .",
