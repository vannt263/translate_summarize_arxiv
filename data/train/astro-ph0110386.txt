    "2001 ) can be understood within the hierarchical clustering scenario ; the morphology - density relation , namely the fact that dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) are clustered around the dominant galaxies in the groups while dirrs are found at much larger distances from them ( mateo 1998 ; grebel 2000 ) likely reflects the continuous transformation of dirrs into dsphs as they fall into the overdensity of the group and are stirred by the tidal field of the primary galaxies ( mayer et al .",

    "the currently popular incarnations of hierarchical scenarios , namely cold dark matter models , are challenged by the apparent dearth of small satellites below @xmath4 km / s ( moore et al . 1999 ; klypin et al . 1999 ) and by the rotation curves of dirrs and lsb galaxies , that suggest that their halos have constant density cores instead of the predicted steep cusps ( cote et al .",

    "dsphs the flattening of the star counts in the vicinity of the nominal tidal radius ( irwin & hatzdimitriou 1995 ) has been often interpreted as a signature of the presence of tidal tails ( johnston et al .",
    "however , some authors have argued that such peculiar profiles indicate that the dwarfs are not bound and thus no dark matter would be needed to explain the large velocity dispersions ( kuhn & miller 1989 ; klessen & kroupa 1995 ) .",

    "the size and mass of unbound structures originating from the galaxies must be determined by both the typical densities of the latter ( including dark matter ) and the scale - length of their stellar components .",
    "very dense systems , or systems with stellar components whose size is such that they lie well inside the tidal radius , will be harder to strip ( moore 1996 ) . in cdm models",
    "dark matter halos have cuspy profiles with inner slopes @xmath6 or steeper ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 , navarro et al .",
    "1997 ; moore et al . 1999b ; ghigna et al . 2000 ) , but their typical densities within the radius of the stellar component , measured by the concentration @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the characteristic scale radius and @xmath9 is the tidal radius ) can vary considerably ( bullock et al .",
    "2000 ) ; the higher is the concentration the steeper is the rise of the rotation curve and hence the local escape speed will be also higher .",

    "moreover , the choice of the orbital parameters of the interacting systems also plays a role by defining both the typical intensity and the time dependence of the external tidal forces ; for the dwarf satellites of the milky way and m31 , we have distances and some information on the orbits themselves ( mateo 1998 ) , which allows us to constrain the parameter space better than in the case of more remote binary systems . in addition",
    ", the subsequent evolution of the material stripped from dwarf satellites can provide useful information on the potential of the milky way and m31 ; infact , the orbits that the tidal debris will follow will reflect the underlying mass distribution .    in order to explore the role of tidal effects on stellar systems embedded in halos analogous to those forming in cold dark matter models , we have carried out several high - resolution n - body simulations of dwarf galaxies interacting with the external potential of the milky way .",

    "1998 ; klessen & kroupa 1998 ; helmi & white 1999 ) employed spherical king models to represent their mass distribution and placed them on mostly circular orbits in the potential of the primary halo .",
    "the structure and orbits of the galaxies were thus detached from the predictions of structure formation models .",
    "we use more sophisticated models of dwarf satellites , whose halo masses , sizes and density profiles are consistent with those of objects already in place at @xmath10 in hierarchical cosmologies ( white & frenk 1991 ) , the dsphs being at least as old .",
    "the initial dwarf models are placed on bound orbits in the milky way halo , which is modeled by the external potential of an isothermal sphere with mass @xmath11 , circular velocity @xmath12 km / s , virial radius @xmath13 kpc and core radius of 4 kpc ( see mayer et al .",

    "1998 ) . in the simplest model",
    "in which the dark matter halo is a singular isothermal sphere , we have @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the spin parameter , which measures the amount of kinetic energy stored into rotation , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the binding energy and @xmath35 is the total angular momentum of the halo ) .",
    "n - body simulations show that the spin parameter of large samples of halos follows a log - normal distribution , with mean values in the range @xmath36 and dispersions @xmath37 ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; warren et al .",
    "1992 ; gardner 2001 ) .",
    "our reference isothermal lsb models ( lis1 , see figure 1 ) have scale - lengths corresponding to @xmath38 ( i.e. slightly above the average values ) ; the resulting scale length is equal to the core radius of the halo , this being consistent with the analysis of rotation curves in the sample of dirrs / lsb galaxies in de blok & mcgaugh ( 1997 ) . we also consider a model with the same @xmath18 but @xmath30 lowered by a factor of 2 which corresponds to a smaller spin parameter , @xmath39 ( model lis3 , in figure 1 ) ; this model has the same disk mass of model lis1 , and thus the central surface brightness is @xmath40 mag arcsec@xmath28 ( 1.5 magnitudes higher than the standard value ) .    in more realistic nfw halos",
    "the scale length of the disks depends not only on @xmath32 but also on the concentration @xmath41 and on the halo / disk mass ratio ; the more baryons accumulate in the center , the more the whole system contracts in response and thus the smaller is the final scale - length of the baryons .",
    "all these aspects are taken into account in the algorithm used for building the galaxies ( see springel & white 1999 ) but , for the sake of simplicity , we keep the halo / disk mass ratio close to @xmath42 in all our models . the reference nfw model with @xmath23 and @xmath38 ( model lnc7s1 in figure 1 ) has the same disk mass and radius of the isothermal model lis1 but the rotation curve rises more steeply ; the rotation curve of the isothermal model is better reproduced by a model with @xmath22 ( model lnc4s1 in figure 1 ) .",
    "we investigate also the effect of varying only @xmath32 at fixed @xmath41 ; models lnc7s2 and lnc7s4 have @xmath23 but @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively ( a value of @xmath32 as high as @xmath45 is found in @xmath46 of halos in cosmological simulations ) .",
    "we consider different orbital eccentricities , ranging from apo / peri=2 to apo / peri=15 and different disk orientations , although we neglect cases in which the satellites are on retrograde orbits , as it is well known that this configuration strongly inhibits the formation of tidal tails , irrespective of the internal structure of galaxies ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; dubinski et al .",

    "the orbits have apocenters between 150 and 250 kpc and pericenters between 20 and 80 kpc , thus encompassing the whole range of galactocentric distances of dsphs .",
    "here we present the results of the simulations in three separate subsections ; in 3.1 we will show that we are able to reproduce the observed outer flat profile of carina and that this happens when the halo of the dwarf has a sufficiently shallow mass distribution or when the orbit is nearly radial ; in 3.2 we will analyze the discrepancy between the intrinsic mass loss rates measured in the simulations and those inferred from the observations ; finally , in 3.3 we will evolve the tidal debris of spherical dwarf models within a cdm halo extracted from a cosmological simulation and will show how the streams undergo precession and heating by substructure , losing their coherence and becoming difficult to detect .",
    "the satellites are severely stripped by the milky way tides but a bound stellar and dark component survives until the end of the simulations ( @xmath47 gyr ) ; after a few orbits ( the orbital times are of the order of 2 - 3 gyr ) , the stellar disk is transformed into a moderately triaxial system supported by velocity dispersion that closely resembles a dsph ( see also mayer et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the projected star counts from four representative simulations . in all cases we find tidal streams of stars escaping from the satellites which show up as a flattening of the outer projected star counts .",
    "the surface brightness of the tails depends strongly on the orbit and the structure of the initial models ; the `` strength '' of the streams can be quantified simply by the surface density of stars compared to the centrally measured value , @xmath48 .",
    "satellites with cored isothermal halos or low concentration ( @xmath22 ) nfw halos can reproduce very closely the extended flattened star counts observed in carina ( majewski et al .",
    "2000 ) , for which @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , the observations are reproduced even for orbits with moderate eccentricities ( apo / peri=2 - 3 ) for these initial galaxy models .    instead , the streams are too weak to match the observations if the concentration is as high as @xmath50 , unless the orbits are nearly radial ( figure 2 ) .",
    "in fact , raising the concentration by a factor of 2 leads to an increase of nearly 30 % in the escape speed at the half mass radius of the stars where the rotation curve peaks .",
    "( this also increases their robustness to tides since its response will be more adiabatic , see section 3.2 . ) in this case @xmath51 .",
    "this is true even when the satellite is constructed with @xmath32 considerably larger than the mean and thus acquires a larger disk scale - length ( as in the case of the model lnc7s4 shown in figure 2 ) .",
    "infact , the value of the concentration is the most important parameter in determining the amount of stripped material ; a change in the spin affects only the disk - scale length , while a change in the concentration affects both the scale - length and the central density of the halo , or , equivalently , its local escape speed .",
    "however , if the initial disk scale - length is substantially decreased while keeping the disk mass fixed , the resulting higher surface density of the disk can affect its evolution enhancing the non - axisymmetric instabilities that drive the morphological transformation ; in fact , in model lis3 , the high self - gravity of the compact disk leads to a strong bar instability and later to a very compact stellar remnant , thereby inhibiting the developing of tidal tails ( see also mayer et al .",

    "the feature is more prominent when the line of sight of the observer falls _ along _",
    "one of the tidal tails , because the projected surface density of the tails is maximally enhanced in this case .",
    "when viewed perpendicular to the orbit , the tails can be more easily separated from the bound stars visually , but in this case they have the lowest surface density ( indeed corresponding to the actual intrinsic value ) , @xmath53 30 mag arcsec@xmath54 .    in figure 3",
    "we show in more detail the results for the satellite models lis1 and lnc4s1 with @xmath55 km / s ( these have an initial total mass of only @xmath56 ) as these yield remnants with physical scales close to those of carina .",
    "infact , we note that the flattening of the star counts occurs at 1 - 2 kpc from the center , the core radius of the bound remnant estimated from the fit with a king model with @xmath57 is around 500 pc and the luminosity of the remnants is @xmath58 , assuming a final stellar mass - to - light ratio of 5 ( as derived by combining population synthesis models with a model for the star formation history as described in mayer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) .",
    "the final dark matter mass is almost 5 times higher than the stellar mass , yielding a central velocity dispersion @xmath59 km / s , as seen in figure 4 ; the corresponding final @xmath60 would be around 25 for a stellar mass - to - light ratio of 5 , in fairly good agreement with the observations ( mateo 1998 ) and comfortably higher than the lower limit obtained by lake ( 1990 ) for galactic dwarf spheroidals .",
    "in general , the presence of tidal extensions will lead to an overestimate in the velocity dispersions of the dwarf caused by unbound stars in projection ; as already noted by others before ( e.g. piatek & pryor 1992 ) , a velocity gradient or an apparent rotation would also be observed due to the asymmetrical contamination introduced by tidal tails .",
    "however , in our simulations the apparent velocity dispersions in the central region of dwarfs are at most @xmath61 larger than the intrinsic value , which would inflate the measured @xmath60 by no more than a factor @xmath62 ( giving @xmath63 in the remnants lnc4s1 and lis1 ) .",
    "figure 4 clearly shows that only measurements extending a few kpcs from the center would be significantly altered ; therefore the contamination of kinematics induced by tails would not explain the high mass - to - light ratios of dsphs without dark matter , contrary to previous claims ( e.g. kuhn & miller 1989 ; kuhn 1991 ) .",

    "( 1999 ) found that the contamination of streams in the projected star counts can show up even inside the intrinsic tidal radius of the satellites if the viewing angle is not perpendicular to the tails .",
    "we determined the final tidal radii of our remnants with skid , that identifies all the particles bound to the dwarf ; we found that marginally bound particles are found as far as 3 - 4 kpc from the center , namely at a larger distance than the break radius in any of the projections .",
    "however , this marginally bound region ( that corresponds to the very inner part of the tails ) comprises only a few percent of the total mass of the remnant .",
    "we conclude that , although the break radius is not equivalent to the tidal radius , it roughly defines the boundary of the remnant , encompassing @xmath64 of the bound mass .      estimating the mass loss rate of satellites from extra - tidal features is not a straightforward task .",

    "( 1999 ) have proposed a formula for estimating the mass loss rate of an orbiting stellar system which relies on the assumption that the number counts surface density profile of the extra - tidal material is @xmath65 .",
    "majewski et al . ( 2000 ) have applied such a formula to the star counts profile they obtain for carina and derive an extremely large fractional mass loss rate , @xmath66 gyr@xmath3 .",
    "this would imply that the mass of the stellar component in carina would have been reduced by as much as a factor of 30 in 10 gyr .",
    "we obtain comparable fractional mass loss rates applying the same formula to the remnants in our simulations , while the actual average fractional mass loss rates measured in the simulations ( obtained by simply dividing the total mass lost by the duration of the simulation of about 10 gyr ) are significantly lower , @xmath67 .",
    "= 8truecm = 8truecm    one problem in the application of the formula is the assumed radial surface density profile of the stream .",
    "infact , the outer star counts profile of our remnants are much flatter than @xmath21 for most of the viewing projections . removing the constraint on the profile of the extra - tidal stars , johnston et al .",
    "( 1999 ) derive also an upper limit for the mass loss rate :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the angle between the velocity vector of the satellite and the line - of - sight ( which can be derived for those satellites that have measured proper motions ) , @xmath70 is the number of stars counted within @xmath71 ( the radius where the profile changes slope ) and @xmath72 is the orbital time . using equation ( 1 ) for the cases with clear tidal features we obtain @xmath73 gyr@xmath3 , which is still not representative of the numerical results , being higher than the real mass loss rate by nearly an order of magnitude .    equation ( 1 ) is derived under the assumption that the stars are lost continuously over the orbital time @xmath72 .",
    "however , the tidal mass loss for a satellite moving on an eccentric orbit will occur mostly as a result of the tidal shocks suffered at pericenter and will depend on its ability to respond to the perturbation and adjust to a new equilibrium . to gain a better insight into the mechanism",
    ", we can consider a galaxy that suffers a tidal shock of duration @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are , respectively , the distance and the velocity of the galaxy at the pericenter of the orbit .",
    "the characteristic time required for a star at the disk half mass radius @xmath77 to increase its mean - square velocity @xmath78 due to the shock is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the internal ( rotational ) velocity of the galaxy and @xmath81 is the velocity impulse ; this timescale will be comparable to the characteristic timescale of mass loss ( see binney & tremaine , 1987 ) .",
    "gnedin , hernquist & ostriker ( 1999 ) have provided analytical formulas to calculate @xmath81 for a satellite that is shocked by an extended perturber with an isothermal profile including even the adiabatic corrections that account for the motion of the stars within the galaxy .",
    "as shown by the authors , if the orbits are eccentric , a good approximation is obtained by simply assuming that the satellite is moving on a straight path . in the latter case",
    "we can write    @xmath82    where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the total mass and radius of the perturber and the last term in the product is the first - order adiabatic correction ( @xmath85 is the typical stellar frequency at @xmath86 , and @xmath87 in our models , where @xmath88 is the dynamical time at @xmath86 ) . for a satellite with @xmath89 km / s and @xmath90 kpc on the apo / peri=3 orbits in our simulations ( @xmath91 kpc , @xmath92 km / s ) , we obtain @xmath93 gyr .",

    "1996 ) might somewhat enhance the observed evolution of the streams . in order to test our results we ran a massless spherical satellite in a @xmath108 particles milky way - sized halo with an nfw profile ; this halo is similar to the cdm halo as far as profile , mass and radius are concerned but it is spherical and does not have substructure , therefore no physical heating or precession is expected . after 10 gyr we measured fluctuations of only a few percent in the orbital energy and orbital angular momentum , and , correspondingly , the initial orbital plane of the satellite is barely altered ; this shows that two - body heating has a negligible contribution to the evolution of the streams ( this is a conservative test since the cdm halo in the cosmological volume had a resolution almost ten times higher ) .",
    "the experiment illustrated in this section ignores the dissipative effects of a baryonic component that would help regularise the structure of the inner dark matter halo . however , the outer halo would remain unaffected by the adiabatic contraction and this tends to produce oblate inner halos ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 ) .",
    "coherent streams should only be found in the plane of the disk or on polar orbits .",
    "our results suggest that using streams to constrain the potential structure of galactic halos will be complicated by these effects .",
    "evidence of streams on great circles in galaxy and cluster halos would support models in which the dark matter behaves like a fluid . in this case , halos are highly spherical and contain less mass attached to subhalos due to ram - pressure stripping .",
    "interestingly , the stream associated with the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal appears as a great circle ; ibata et .",
    "( 2001 ) , based on the analysis of the latter , have recently argued that the galactic halo must be nearly spherical between 16 and 60 kpc from the center .",
    "we have shown that the outer flattening observed in the stellar profiles of some dsphs can provide a useful constraint on the structure of their dark matter halos once their orbital eccentricity is known . at present , the few proper motions available ( e.g. kroupa & bastian 1997 for the lmc and smc , schweitzer et al . 1995 for sculptor and schweitzer & cudworth 1996 for ursa minor ) imply that the galactic satellites have orbits with low eccentricities , with typical apo / peri=2 - 3 .",
    "it is clear that systems on these orbits with concentrations as high as predicted in the standard lcdm cosmology ( eke et al .",
    "2000 ) for galaxies with @xmath109 km / s ( @xmath26 ) would not be able to reproduce the observed star counts of the carina dsph .",
    "one might argue that the properties of halos in cdm models have a large scatter .",
    "however , recently bullock et al . ( 2001 ) have measured the scatter of the concentration of halo profiles in lcdm simulations and , according to their results , a concentration of @xmath23 is already a lower limit for halos with @xmath110 ( i.e. corresponding to the most massive among the models considered in this paper ) , suggesting that we are being conservative with our constraints .",
    "satellites with either softened isothermal halos or cuspy halos with low concentrations , exhibit features that can reproduce the observations  even on orbits with moderate eccentricities .",
    "interestingly we note that the values of the concentration needed ( @xmath0 ) are as low as those found within wdm models at the dwarf galaxy scale ( eke et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "our results have implications on the actual dark matter content of dsphs .",
    "large tidal tails are produced only when the dark matter in the remnants accounts for @xmath111 % of the total mass .",
    "the apparent @xmath60 can be at most two times higher than the intrinsic value because of the unbound stars projected along the line of sight and therefore we expect to find tidal tails only around dwarfs whose measured @xmath60 is not very high .",
    "indeed most of the dsphs in the local group , including carina , have @xmath112 ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "the dark matter contents of draco and ursa minor , having @xmath113 ( hargreaves et al . 1994a.b , mateo 1998 ) are instead too high even accounting for enhanced apparent velocity dispersions .",
    "such high dark matter contents would be incompatible with the observations of massive tails ; the remnants that have similarly large dark matter contents at the end of our simulations ( see also mayer et al .",
    "( 2001a , b ) on the evolution of the gr8 model ) have star counts at the level @xmath114 in the outer part .",
    "although very recent results exclude the presence of tails in draco ( odenkirchen et al .",
    "2001 ; aparicio et al .",
    "2001 ) , other authors have reported positive detections of some extra tidal stars around the latter dwarf and ursa minor ( piatek et al .",
    "2001 , martinz - delgado et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) . in order to further explore this issue we ran a simulation with a satellite model different from those used so far .",
    "we used an nfw halo with a high concentration , @xmath115 , and @xmath55 km / s , and a disk extending out to half of the virial radius of the halo , @xmath116 kpc , corresponding to a high spin parameter , @xmath117 , and a very low central surface brightness , @xmath118 mag arcsec@xmath28 .",
    "we placed the model on an orbit with an apo / peri@xmath119 and a pericenter @xmath120 kpc , consistent with the present distances and radial velocities of draco and ursa minor ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "after 7 gyr the satellite has turned into a dsph ( @xmath121 ) with a central velocity dispersion @xmath122 km / s and a dark matter halo still 7 times more massive than the stellar component ; this would yield @xmath123 for a stellar mass - to light ratio @xmath124 ( mayer et al .",
    "furthermore , due to its unusually large scale length , the stellar component has undergone severe stripping , producing prominent tidal tails and signatures in the star count profile qualitatively similar to those observed in carina ( figure 8) ; including possible projection effects due to the tidal tails , the apparent mass - to - light ratio could be enhanced up to values around 80 .",
    "this experiment shows that an extremely extended disk can produce large tails notwithstanding the high central dark matter density of the halo .",
    "however , a closer look shows that the remnant is very extended in radius and the flattening of the star counts in the remnants occurs at more than 4 kpc , which is too far out compared to the size of draco , the latter being less than 1 kpc ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , a dwarf progenitor with an extremely extended disk is hard to support from the observational point of view ; the rotation curves of dirrs and lsb spirals suggest that the scale - lengths of halos and baryons are correlated ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) and in some cases the scale - length of the halo can be larger than the typical disk size ( lake & skillmann 1990 ) , while in the present model is considerably smaller . in the present model would clearly cause besides , the surface density of the gas in the outer part of such an extended disk would be so low that the star formation would have hardly occurred , making the formation of stellar tails unlikely .",
    "= 8truecm    the correct evaluation of the @xmath60 of dsphs is important when one tries to compare the observed number of galactic satellites with the numbers predicted by cosmological n - body simulations ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ; klypin et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it has been pointed out that dwarfs with nfw halos should have rising velocity dispersion profiles and that by using the measured _ central _ velocity dispersions one would actually underestimate the total mass of dsphs ( white 200 ) ; including this correction would improve the agreement with observations ( moore 2001 ) .",
    "our simulations suggest two possible scenarios with regard to this issue and both are highlighted in figure 4 . first",
    ", if it were confirmed that most of the satellites have large tidal tails and that their orbits have low eccentricity , then it is very likely that their halos have low concentrations , @xmath125 , and have quite flat intrinsic and apparent velocity dispersion profiles ; the apparent velocity dispersion can actually be higher than any value of the intrinsic velocity dispersion , but never smaller , which would actually tend to _ reverse _ the correction , ( cfr .",
    "figure 4a ) . secondly ,",
    "even if the satellites had more concentrated nfw halos ( 1 ) the intrinsic peak velocity dispersion is only @xmath126 higher than the central value in the remnants and ( 2 ) the intervening tidal debris , though quite weak , tend to flatten even further the apparent velocity dispersion profile ( cfr .",
    "figure 4b ) .",
    "hence , it seems that a better assessment of the actual mass of the dwarfs derived from apparent velocity dispersions would never solve the substructure problem and could actually make it worse .",
    "we have used numerical simulations of two component models of dwarf galaxies orbiting within a milky way potential to study the effects related to their tidal tails .",
    "the signatures produced by the tidal debris in the stellar profiles can be used to constrain the structure of the dark matter halos of dwarfs , providing hints to the nature of the dark matter .",
    "the long term evolution of tidal debris was followed within a smooth spherical potential and within a high resolution cold dark matter halo .",
    "we summarize our conclusions here :    @xmath127 we can produce tails as prominent as observed around the carina dsph for models with soft central potentials or singular potentials on highly radial orbits .",
    "knowledge of the orbits of the dsphs is vital to constrain directly their internal structure .",
    "if it will be confirmed that the orbits are nearly circular , warm dark matter models will be favored instead of cold dark matter .",
    "@xmath127 models with very high mass to light ratios and strong tidal tails are very difficult to produce .",
    "draco and ursa minor should only have very weak tails , at a star count level at least ten times lower than that found in carina .",
    "@xmath127 our simulations provide a simple estimate of the mass loss rates of dsphs based on star counts and these are significantly lower than those obtained by others discarding adiabatic corrections ; carina is likely to survive for at least another 5 gyr .",
    "@xmath127 only satellites on very tightly bound orbits like sagittarius , that suffered many strong tidal shocks , could have been already destroyed in the past or could be now close to disruption .",
    "@xmath127 central velocity dispersions of stars in dsphs are good indicators of the characteristic peak velocity dispersions of their dark matter halos .",
    "i.e. tidal heating produces nearly isotropic orbits and quite flat velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "@xmath127 the masses of dwarf spheroidals could be overestimated when large tidal tails are present but the maximum effect due to projection of unbound stars is only a factor of two . however , this would shift the mass function of galactic satellites further away from that predicted by cold dark matter models , making the substructure problem even worse .    @xmath127 the tidal debris within a cold dark matter halo shows dramatic signatures of differential precession and some heating by dark matter substructures",
    ". it may be impossible to use observations of tidal streams to map the structure of the galactic halo .",
    "@xmath127 if many examples of coherent tidal streams are discovered , then this would favor fluid dark matter models which produce smoother and highly spherical dark matter halos .",
