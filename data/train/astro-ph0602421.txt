    "giant labs such as discovered in s00 are known to be @xmath11 times larger than typical compact laes .",
    "however , m04 revealed the existence of a large number of slightly smaller and fainter blobs that show rather continuous distribution in ly@xmath1 spatial extents between giant labs and compact laes .",
    "it is thus also important to understand the relation between labs and compact laes in order to reveal the nature of labs .    in this letter",
    ", we report the results of an intermediate resolution ( @xmath0  ) spectroscopy of ly@xmath1 sources ranging from giant labs to compact laes at @xmath2 in the ssa22 field .",
    "matsuda et al .",
    "( 2005 ) previously obtained 56 spectra for laes in the same field , but the depths and the spectral resolution were insufficient to examine their line profiles .",
    "we assume an @xmath12 , @xmath13 universe with @xmath14 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( @xmath15 corresponds to 7.6 kpc of physical length at @xmath2 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic targets were chosen from candidate ly@xmath1 sources identified in m04 .",
    "we briefly describe the selection criteria below .",
    "we used narrow - band ( @xmath16 ; 4977/77 ) and broad - band images in the ssa22 field ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , [ j2000 ] ) obtained with the suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) on the 8.2 m subaru telescope .",
    "the average stellar profile of the images has a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath15 .",

    "the magnitudes and colors are calculated by the _",
    "same _ isophotal apertures determined on the smoothed @xmath19 image with the same isophotal limit as the detection threshold .",
    "we selected 277 candidate ly@xmath1 sources , which satisfy the following criteria : ( 1 ) @xmath24 ab mag , and ( 2 ) observed equivalent width @xmath25   ( or ly@xmath1 luminosity l@xmath26 erg s@xmath4 at @xmath2 ) ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we denote them as no .",
    "001 through no . 277 in order of isophotal areas . the largest 35 candidates with isophotal areas @xmath5 arcsec@xmath6 ( or @xmath27 kpc@xmath6 at @xmath2 ) are identical with the labs presented in m04 .",
    "the candidates lying near the solid curve in figure 1 ( the expected values for point sources ) are not resolved in the narrow - band image .",

    "we carried out spectroscopic observations of 37 out of the 277 candidates using the deimos spectrograph ( faber et al .",
    "2003 ) on the 10 m keck ii telescope in august 1418 2004 ( ut ) .",
    "the 37 targets are widely distributed in isophotal areas ( see fig .",
    "the field of view of a slit mask is about @xmath29 .",
    "we used the 900 l / mm grism and the gg455 filter .",
    "the typical wavelength coverage is @xmath30  .",
    "the slit widths for all objects are @xmath15 .",
    "the slit lengths range from @xmath31 to @xmath32 in order to obtain sky outside of their ly@xmath1 spatial extents .",

    "the pixel sampling is 0.44   in wavelength and @xmath33 in spatial direction .",
    "we used one slit mask in this observing run .",
    "total exposure time was 7 hours with each 30 minutes exposure .",
    "the seeing ranged from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "we reduced the data using spec2d pipeline . for analysis of integrated line profiles discussed in this letter , we made one dimensional spectra combining @xmath36 around emission line peaks .",
    "while extended emission lines were clearly detected for some objects , a study of the faint outskirts with lower signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) needs further careful analysis and the results will be presented elsewhere in the future .",
    "the spectra are not flux calibrated .",
    "we detected emission - lines for all the observed 37 spectra with peaks above s / n of 3 per spectral resolution .",
    "the emission lines have variety in their line profiles ( fig .",
    "2 ) . for example ,",
    "004 has double peaks .",
    "the both blueshifted and redshifted emission lines have clear asymmetry . when we use statistics of line asymmetry and the `` flux ratio '' as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the wavelength of the peak of the emission line , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the points at which the line flux exceeds 10% of the peak on the blue side and the red side respectively . ] , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , proposed by rhoads et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the lines have values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( the blueshifted line ) , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( the redshifted line ) .",
    "these values show that the blueshifted line has a steeper drop on the red side than the blue side , and the redshifted line has opposite asymmetry .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to interpret them as a relatively broad emission line with a single narrow absorption .",
    "031 has line profile similar to that of no . 004 .",
    "similar line profiles were also reported for lab2 in the same field ( wilman et al .",
    "2005 ) , @xmath47 laes around a radio galaxy ( venemans et al . 2005 ) and radio galaxies at @xmath48 ( wilman et al .",
    "030 has a single peaked emission line with a strong absorption on the blue side ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "103 , 151 and 241 have symmetric single narrow emission lines ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "although these lines do not show clear asymmetry often seen in ly@xmath1 emission lines at higher redshifts ( e.g. hu et al .",
    "2004 ; dawson et al .",
    "2004 ) , this may be due to the fact that the effect of absorptions by intergalactic clouds on the blue side of ly@xmath1 line is weaker at @xmath53 ( songaila et al .",
    "these spectra show no other emission lines to suggest that the identified lines are not ly@xmath1 .",
    "the spectral resolution of 2.2   is sufficient to resolve foreground [ ] @xmath54 doublets if there are .",
    "only one object ( no . 237 ) turns out to be a @xmath55 [ ] emitter , as it has very narrow double peaked emission lines with the separation of @xmath56  , and [ ] @xmath57 and h@xmath58 at longer wavelength ( fig .",
    "3 ) . no . 053 and 070 have the broadest emission lines and show emission lines at longer wavelength .",
    "their broad ly@xmath1 emission lines are likely to be due to agns in the objects .",
    "we examined the _",
    "velocity widths of the ly@xmath1 emission lines by fitting a single gaussian function .",
    "we used only emission line part ( i.e. within @xmath59 times the dispersion of the gaussian function ) , and masked possible absorption lines as shown in figure 2 .",
    "if the spectra show double peaks , we masked the region between the peaks .",
    "we then studied the distribution of ly@xmath1 velocity widths of 28 objects with peaks above s / n of 6 per spectral resolution without 2 agns .",
    "they have the velocity widths ( fwhm ) in the range of @xmath3 km s@xmath4 , with a median of 550 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the widths are corrected for the instrumental resolution .",
    "the 12 labs have the widths of @xmath7 km s@xmath4 , with a median of 780 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the 7 compact laes have the widths of @xmath60 km s@xmath4 , with a median of 280 km s@xmath4 .",
    "venemans et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported that @xmath47 laes around a radio galaxy have the widths in the range of @xmath61 km s@xmath4 , with a median of 260 km s@xmath4 .",
    "these values are very similar to those of our compact laes .",
    "we plot the ly@xmath1 velocity widths and the ly@xmath1 isophotal areas in figure 4 .",
    "there is a correlation between the velocity widths and the isophotal areas .",
    "a spearman rank correlation analysis shows that the correlation has @xmath62 and significance level of 99.9% .",
    "the uncertainties of velocity widths by the fit are shown in figure 4 .",
    "we also estimated the uncertainties of the isophotal areas as follows .",
    "we put @xmath63 @xmath19 images of each object at 100 random positions on the original @xmath19 image and re - measured the isophotal areas .",
    "note that the derived uncertainties of the isophotal areas may be slightly overestimated because the re - measured isophotal areas were affected by combinations of noise from the thumbnail images of the objects and the original @xmath19 image .",
    "we found the correlation between the ly@xmath1 velocity widths and the ly@xmath1 isophotal areas and that all the labs have the widths of @xmath7 km s@xmath4 .",
    "there are several possible physical interpretations of the ly@xmath1 velocity widths ; motion of gravitationally - bound gas clouds , inflows , merging of clumps , or outflows from superwinds .",
    "we consider the first case that the ly@xmath1 velocity widths are due to motion of gravitationally - bound gas clouds within collapsed dark matter halos .",
    "if we assume random motions in a singular isothermal sphere ( @xmath64 ) , the dynamical mass can be estimated to be @xmath65 , or @xmath66 where @xmath67 is one dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath68 is the gravitational constant and @xmath69 is the radius of ly@xmath1 nebulae .",
    "when we use the radius of a circle with area which is equivalent to the ly@xmath1 isophotal area , the dynamical masses of the 12 labs are estimated to be @xmath70 m@xmath9 ( fig .",
    "the mass estimation suggests that labs already have their massive halos comparable to those of present day massive galaxies .",
    "if we consider inflows or merging of clumps , the gas clouds or clumps may have not yet been accelerated enough in the gravitational potential of dark matter halos . in these cases ,",
    "the mass estimation may give lower limits .",
    "we consider the next case that the ly@xmath1 velocity widths are due to gas outflows from superwinds . in this case",
    ", the velocity widths may not represent the masses of the objects .",
    "heckman et al . ( 2000 ) reported that there is no tight correlation between the rotation velocities and the outflow velocities for low redshift starburst galaxies .",
    "martin ( 2005 ) , however , recently revisited the issue and revealed a correlation with a larger sample .",
    "if the same correlation holds at high redshifts , ly@xmath1 sources with larger velocity widths would have larger dynamical masses .",
    "if we assume outflows from a central starburst , we can also estimate the characteristic time - scales of star - formation by their spatial extents and typical outflow speeds .",
    "if we divide @xmath71 by the ly@xmath1 velocity widths , the time - scales are estimated to be in the range of @xmath72 yr ( fig .",
    "4b ) . note that the time - scales are only upper limits for unresolved compact laes .",
    "geach et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested that the labs have average star - formation rate of @xmath73 m@xmath9 yr@xmath4 by their sub - mm observations .",
    "if the labs have continuous star formation at this rate for several @xmath74 yr , they would have large stellar masses of several @xmath75 m@xmath9 .",
    "thus the large velocity widths of labs imply that they are indeed hosted in the massive systems .",
    "their large spatial extents , large ly@xmath1 luminosity , and rather chaotic structures seen in their line profiles , as well as high sub - mm detection rate , also support that they are in active forming phase .",
