    "it is known that many body processes can have a dramatic effect on the optical spectra of a degenerate electron gas .",
    "one of the most notable examples is optical absorption and emission processes in metals where a localized hole state is involved , the so - called x - ray fermi edge singularity ( fes ) phenomena @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this effect is dominated by two competing contributions , the anderson orthogonality catastrophe @xcite due to the fermi sea shakeup and the mahan `` exciton '' @xcite , due to the electron - hole interaction .",
    "the first effect leads to a strong reduction of the absorption and the emission intensity close to the x - ray absorption edge , while the second one is manifested by the power law divergence at the threshold energy @xcite .",
    "the shakeup effect that occurs in optical transitions in which excitations of the electron gas are created , also leads to a low - energy tail in the emission spectrum @xcite . the same type of processes were studied in semiconductor quantum well structures with a degenerate two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "the fes effect in the luminescence spectra of modulation - doped ingaas - inp quantum wells was observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the effect was attributed to the hole localization due to the alloy fluctuations .    the experiments in 2deg structures were also carried out in the quantum hall regime .",
    "the case of a 2deg in a semiconductor in a strong perpendicular magnetic field essentially differs from that of metals , since in the 2d case the conduction - band states are quantized into discrete landau levels ( lls ) . as a result the photoluminescence spectrum turns into a series of equally spaced magnetoluminescence ( ml ) lines with the spacing given by the electron cyclotron energy @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the low - energy photoluminescence tail is also transformed into a series of satellite lines , so - called shakeup ( su ) satellites , which are below the main ml spectrum .",
    "the reason is that in the presence of a magnetic field the shakeup process generates discrete inter - ll excitations , `` magnetoplasmons '' ( mps ) , in which an electron is promoted from one ll to a higher one , across the fermi energy .",
    "for the first time , the fes effect ( a strong enhancement of the intensities of the ml spectral lines towards the fermi energy ) and the su satellites were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "futher experimental investigations of the su spectra in 2d structures were carried out in refs.@xcite-@xcite . in early refs.@xcite,@xcite",
    "was found that the strength of the shakeup is controlled by the localization of the photocreated hole .",
    "in addition , a strong suppression of shakeup processes at hight magnetic fields was observed and qualitatively discussed in refs.@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the discussion is based on the theoretical results for the hole green s function at zero magnetic field which are obtained in ref.@xcite . in recent refs.@xcite,@xcite periodic changes of the shakeup line intensities in the filling factor",
    "were reported . in ref.@xcite",
    "a role of the hole localization on the main and su magnetoluminescence spectra was studied . in ref.@xcite",
    "2d structures with delocalized photocreated holes were investigated and a strong suppression of shakeup processes was observed when electrons occupy only the lowest ll .",
    "the shakeup processes due to the creation of the spin - wave excitations were studied in refs.@xcite,@xcite .",
    "a theory of optical and magneto - optical phenomena in a 2deg was given in refs .",
    "@xcite- @xcite , where numerical calculations of the optical spectra are presented . in ref.@xcite the influence of the hole mass , temperature and the electron - hole interaction strength on the main magneto - optical spectra is discussed .",
    "it is noted also that the su spectrum is more pronounced when the interaction strength increases .",
    "recently the fes problem in a 2deg was solved analytically for the case of a weak magnetic field when a large integral number of landau levels are filled @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the theoretical model of the su spectrum was developed for the case of an unlocalized photocreated hole .",
    "observations of a strong suppression of the shakeup effects at a filling factor close to @xmath2 are explained by the competition between the interband and intraband scattering processes .",
    "an analytical description of the su spectrum for the case of a localized hole is absent to - day , to our knowledge . at that reason ,",
    "some theoretical problems are open up to now . for example",
    ", the role of the excitonic effect and hole localization on the su spectrum is not clear .",
    "usually , it is assumed that the su spectrum is due to the anderson orthogonality catastrophe and the contribution of the mahan effect is ignored ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand , in ref.@xcite",
    "is shown that in the case of the main absorption and emission spectra a balance between the mahan effect and the orthogonality catastrophe is important , similarly to the case of the x - ray problem in metals . in the early experimental works @xcite , @xcite",
    "was supposed also that both the fes effect and su spectrum are very sensitive to the localization degree of the photocreated hole , as noted above . however , this assumption is in contrudiction to the numerical calculations in ref.@xcite and the experimental results in refs.@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in addition , in experiments some pecularities of the su spectrum noted above ( a strong suppression of shakeup processes at high magnetic fields@xcite,@xcite and the periodic changes of the shakeup line intensities in the filling factor@xcite,@xcite ) are observed .",
    "these properties of the su spectrum can not be explain by a simple discussion given in refs.@xcite , @xcite and require an analytical treatment .",
    "in this paper we present an analytical study of the su emission spectrum due to transitions between a localized level and a 2deg , subjected to a strong magnetic field .",
    "calculations of the shakeup spectrum are performed with a nozi ` eres - de dominicis - like hamiltonian @xcite , @xcite , in which we treat the interaction part as a perturbation .",
    "the electron - hole interaction is assumed to be much smaller than the cyclotron energy . in this case",
    "the su spectrum can be calculated perturbatively , as the su satellites are due to the creation ( by the optical transition ) of the electron-``hole '' pairs at different landau levels .",
    "we show that the su spectrum is determined by both the anderson orthogonality and the mahan effect . in the general case",
    "the contribution due to the fermi sea shakeup is dominant .",
    "however , for the special case of a short range hole potential , the excitonic effect competes with the shakeup effect .",
    "this competition results to a strong supression of the su spectrum if electrons occupy only the lowest landau level .",
    "we show also that a strong hole localization is not a necessary condition for the su spectrum to be observed .",
    "in addition , we discuss the filling factor dependence of the su lines , as well as the influence of the hole potential range .",
    "we consider here a model that is similar to the one used in the study of core level optical spectra in metals @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , since most of the experiments on magneto - optical spectra in a 2deg were carried out in samples with a disorder due to composition fluctuations . in such structures",
    "some amount of holes are localized due to alloy fluctuations and behave like the core holes in the x - ray problem .",

    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the calculation of the optical spectra reduces to a `` one - body '' problem when the conduction electrons are scattered by a @xmath35 potential due to the hole , switched on / off suddenly at the time of the transition . as a result",

    "the usual selection rule for interband magneto - optical transitions @xmath92 , which is valid for a nonlocalized hole , is lifted . for a localized hole , on the contrary , all lls can be optically active .",
    "indeed , if the hole is localized on a scale smaller than @xmath7 , the optical matrix element @xmath93 , according to its definition above , is given by    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the electron wave function .",

    "in the first case the hole potential is short ranged , while in the second case it can be long ranged .",
    "since the interaction potential @xmath102 is spherically symmetric , the electron scattering takes place only between landau states with the same angular momentum , @xmath103 .    under the assumptions above we obtain for the su spectrum    @xmath104",
    "all angular momentum channels contribute to the shakeup term @xmath71 , as all states are shaken up by the disappearance of the hole in the optical transition . on the other hand",
    ", only the zero - angular momentum channel contributes to the exciton term @xmath73 , since only this channel is involved in the optical process .",
    "thus , in the general case , the @xmath105 spectrum is mostly due to the fermi sea shakeup effect .",
    "when the hole potential @xmath102 is short range compared to @xmath7 , @xmath106 , nonzero - angular momentum shakeup processes are strongly suppressed . indeed , at @xmath106 , using @xmath107",
    "one obtains    @xmath108    as a result , only zero - angular momentum term survives in eq .",

    "thus , for a short range hole potential , the shakeup contribution to the @xmath112 satellite is strongly suppressed by the excitonic contribution .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ sul ] ) that only the processes in which optical transitions and mp excitations occur from different lls , @xmath76 , now survive . in this case , if the three lowest lls are populated , there is no contribution to the @xmath79 satellite from the ml line at @xmath83 when a @xmath84 mp is excited from the @xmath85 ll ( see fig .  [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , there is no contribution from the ml line at @xmath86 when a @xmath87 mp is excited from the @xmath88 ll .",
    "the most important consequence of the result above is that when only the lowest ll is occupied , i.e. , the landau numbers are @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ sul ] ) , the shakeup spectrum disappears .",
    "this conclusion is , probably , not surprising . under the conditions",
    "above , the problem reduces effectively to the one - electron problem , since there is only one electron in the state @xmath114 which is allowed for both optical and scattering transitions . as was noted above , a strong suppression of the su spectrum in the case in which electrons occupy only the lowest ll ,",

    "when the potential range @xmath164 , the @xmath136 intensity has a wide peak at those magnetic fields in which the uppermost ll depopulates , see curves 1 , and 2 .",
    "however , at larger @xmath165 it decreases almost smoothly with increasing @xmath122 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] by curve 3 .",
    "the results above are obtained for a hole wave function and a hole potential that are spherically symmetric .",
    "they are valid also for a nonsymmetric case , when the hole potential is short range .",
    "indeed , at @xmath106 , the scattering matrix elements are defined only by the properties of the electron wave function at @xmath166 , but not by the potential symmetry .",
    "it refers also to the optical matrix elements as the localization length is assumed to be small , @xmath167 . in the opposite case , that of a long range potential , there are , however , changes . unlike the previous case of a symmetric potential ,",
    "now electron scattering occurs also between different angular momentum states . therefore , additional shakeup channels appear and the results must change quantitatively .",
    "however , the shakeup processes in this case will dominate , as before .",
    "the reason is the same as above , namely , all the angular momentum states are shaken up , but the excitonic contribution involves optically active states with only zero angular momentum .",
    "the other restriction is that the hole localization length is much smaller than the magnetic length , @xmath167 . when this condition is violated , the optical matrix elements @xmath168 entering eq .",
    "( [ sam ] ) are changed .",
    "they depend now on the electron quantum number @xmath61 and the hole localization length @xmath6 . choosing the hole wave function to be @xmath169 , one obtains    @xmath170    in addition , the scattering matrix elements eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) have to be substituted by    @xmath171    the matrix elements ( [ vn ] ) describe the auger - like electron - hole scattering processes .",
    "when @xmath6 is not small compared to @xmath7 , the scattering matrix elements ( [ vn ] ) are finite for all angular momentum , even for a short range hole potential .",
    "thus , the shakeup processes are now always dominant and the su spectrum exists in this case also at filling factors @xmath172 . to demonstrate this consider , for example , the case of @xmath173 .",
    "in this case the optical transitions from the lowest ll @xmath89 , are the most intensive , @xmath174 , where @xmath175 .",
    "there is only one line in the main ml spectrum with energy @xmath81 and , therefore , the number of contributions to the su spectrum reduces . in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , for example , only one contribution to the @xmath136 survives , when the ml line at @xmath81 is accompanied by an @xmath49 mp excitation from the @xmath158 ll .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath121 satellite at @xmath173 is given by    @xmath176    where @xmath61 numbers the occupied lls .",
    "the shakeup contribution is dominant and , moreover , the excitonic term does not contribute to each @xmath121 satellite .",
    "indeed , the function @xmath177 differs from zero only if the @xmath66th ll is empty , see eq .",
    "( [ sam1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the excitonic term contributes only to the satellites , with a number @xmath66 equal or larger than the number of occupied lls .",
    "for example , when the three lowest lls @xmath89 , @xmath85 , and @xmath158 are occupied , as in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , this term do not contribute to the first @xmath136 and second @xmath178 satellites , only to the third and higher satellites .",
    "thus , a strong hole localization is not a necessary requist for the su spectrum to be realized .",
    "it is not a case , however , for the fes effect . as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ pe ] ) , in the case of @xmath173 the many - body corrections to the main spectrum vanish , as only the lowest landau state is optically active and the optical transitions from the higher ll @xmath179 are much less intensive , @xmath180 .",
    "the result above for the su spectrum is in contradiction to the statement in the early experimental works ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite,@xcite ) that both the fes effect and su spectrum are very sensitive to a degree of the hole localization .",
    "our conclusions are , however , in agreement with the results from refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations in ref.@xcite ( see fig.1(b ) in ref.@xcite ) and recent experimental observations in ref.@xcite show that the su spectrum , contrary to the fes effect , do not depend stronly on the hole localization .",
    "the effect of the electron spin can be accounted for if we assume that the spin of the conduction electron is conserved in the scattering event with the localized hole .",
    "in fact this approximation is implicit in the statement above that only @xmath181 localized level is involved .",
    "under such a restriction the exchange scattering processes in which the conduction electron and the localized hole would both reverse their spin , are ignored . in this case",
    "the only change is that the emission intensities eqs .",
    "( [ pe ] ) and ( [ su ] ) are multiplied by a factor 2 as there are twice as many electrons involved .",
    "the results above can not be extended to the case of delocalized holes . in this case , as well as in the case of a many state localized hole , the nozi ` eres - de dominicis formalism ,",
    "i.e. , the `` one - body '' representation for the two - particle green s function , is not valid and to obtain the emission spectrum one has to calculate the two - particle green s function .",
    "the case of delocalized holes is studied in ref.@xcite , where a strong suppression of the @xmath136 satellite at @xmath172 was observed for gaas / algaas quantum wells , in which the holes are assumed to be unlocalized .",
    "the amplitude for the shakeup optical transition was calculated up to the second order in the perturbation , namely , up to the first order in the coupling with electromagnetic field , and up to the first order in the electron - hole or electron - electron interaction .",
    "the states of the electron system are given by slater determinants .",
    "it was shown that when an electron from the lowest ll recombines with a valence hole , the contributions to the shakeup transition amplitude due to the electron - hole and electron - electron scattering processes cancel each other .",
    "such a mechanism for the su emission quenching differs from the one presented above . in our model",
    "the electrons in the conduction band are assumed to be noninteracting and the su spectrum disappears as there are no shakeup channels when the hole potential is short range .",
    "the emission spectrum due to transitions between a localized level and a 2deg in a strong magnetic field is calculated analytically .",
    "calculations are performed with a nozi ` eres - de dominicis - like hamiltonian where the interaction part is treated as a perturbation , since the hole potential is assumed to be small compared to the cyclotron energy , @xmath182 .",
    "the shakeup spectrum appears only when the emission is calculated up to the second - order in this perturbation and is a result of a balance between the orthogonality catastrophe and the excitonic effect contributions . in the general case",
    "the shakeup effect is dominant as all the angular momentum states are shaken up , while the excitonic contribution involves the optically active states with zero angular momentum only .",
    "for the special case of a short range hole potential , however , the excitonic effect competes with the shakeup effect as nonzero - angular momentum shakeup processes are strongly suppressed .",
    "if electrons occupy only the lowest ll , i.e. , the filling factor @xmath172 , there are no channels to shake up the fermi sea in the optical transition and the su spectrum disappears . when electrons occupy two or more lls , the satellite intensities oscillate as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "for the opposite case , that of a long range hole potential , the shakeup spectrum is determined mostly by the fermi sea shakeup processes , and the excitonic contribution is much less important . in this case",
    "the satellite intensities decrease smoothly when the magnetic field increases and there is no suppression of the su spectrum when electrons occupy the lowest ll only . a strong hole localization , @xmath167 , is not a crucial condition for the su spectrum to be observed .",
    "if the hole localization length is not small compared to @xmath7 , the su spectrum still exists .",
    "only the number of contributions to the su spectrum reduces and the shakeup processes are always dominant , as compared with the case of a strong hole localization .",
