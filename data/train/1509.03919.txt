    "quantum walks are generally classified into two categories : discrete - time and continuous - time quantum walks  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the former which were first introduced by aharonov _",
    "et al . _ in 1993 .",
    "a discrete - time quantum walk usually involves a quantum coin and a walker .",
    "the coin controls the walker s movement .",
    "since a quantum coin could be in any superposition state of up and down , quantum walks exhibit many different features when compared to classical random walks ( see refs .",
    "for example , the quantum walker spreads at a rate linear in time in the one - dimensional hadamard walk  @xcite , much faster than the square - root rate in the classical counterpart .",
    "another uncommon phenomenon in quantum walks is localization . for a classical random walk on a line or a square network , as well as",
    "the one - dimensional hadamard walk , the probability of finding the walker at a specific position approaches zero when the number of steps is large enough  @xcite . however , tregenna _ et al . _",
    "numerically discovered that in quantum walks on a 2d square lattice , the walker under the control of grover s operator  @xcite was highly probable to be found at its initial position , which was called the walker s localization  @xcite .",
    "then rigorously analyzed this phenomenon and owed localization to degenerate eigenvalues of the system s time - evolution operator  @xcite .",
    "later localization was also found in quantum walks on other kinds of lattices  @xcite or with other coin operators  @xcite .",
    "additional time - dependent phase gates could also cause localization in a 2d alternate hadamard walk according to literature  @xcite .",
    "some quantum walks have been successfully employed to design effective quantum search algorithms  @xcite , whose target is to transform the system to a specific state at a probability of @xmath0 .",
    "thus the localization effect in quantum walks shows potential applications in designing fast search algorithms .",
    "some simple quantum walk models have already been implemented by experiments  @xcite . as the structure of graphene , the honeycomb lattice has been paid much attention to recently .",
    "it may have application prospects in quantum controlling and computing based on 2d hexagonal materials like the graphene and h - bn  @xcite .",
    "besides , since the honeycomb lattice is more complicated than a line or a common 2d square lattice , we could expect more different characteristics in quantum walks on a honeycomb network .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec.[qwframework ] is devoted to the definition and mathematical framework of quantum walks on a honeycomb network . in sec .",
    "[ limit of the state ket ] , we calculate the ket in the limit @xmath1 and show the existence of localization in the grover walk , which is in accord with numerical simulations . then in sec .",
    "[ conditions and dependence of localization ] , we investigate the dependence of localization on the initial state and derive a non - zero average localization probability .",
    "quantum walks governed by other coin operators are considered and the condition for localization is proposed . furthermore in sec .",
    "[ 4dcondition ] , an extended model with a four - state coin is analyzed . in sec .",
    "[ comparison ] , we compare our results to previous models and show the different properties of quantum walks on a honeycomb network .",
    "the quantum walk of a particle is usually described by two hilbert spaces , the coin space @xmath3 and the position space @xmath2 . different from an infinite square lattice or an unrestricted line ,",
    "a honeycomb network is not a kind of bravais lattice , for here are two types of vertices  @xcite .",
    "for example , after we translate the network along the vector @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ honeycomb ] , the new lattice is not identical to the original one .",
    "besides , orthogonal cartesian coordinates , e.g. @xmath5-@xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ honeycomb ] , are inconvenient for describing the positions of vertices here .",
    "therefore , we divide the network into rhombuses and set up an oblique coordinate system .",
    "a vertex is labeled as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for coordinates of the lower left corner of the rhombus in which the vertex is contained , and @xmath10 indicates the type of the vertex .",
    "we make the convention that a black ( white ) vertex is type-0 ( type-1 ) , thus any position eigenket is denoted as @xmath11 , or @xmath12 in short , where @xmath13 represents @xmath14 .",
    ".,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    on a honeycomb lattice , a particle is able to move in three directions , so the dimension of the coin space is three .",
    "the eigenstates of the coin are labeled as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , corresponding to movement along ( against ) @xmath4 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 from a type-0 ( type-1 ) vertex . whether the walker will move _ along _ or _ against _ these vectors",
    "is determined by the _ type _ of the vertex .",
    "the system s total state vector is denoted by a ket in the composite hilbert space @xmath20 .",
    "a single step of quantum walks starts with applying the coin operator @xmath21 on the coin space .",
    "we first choose grover s operator @xmath22 as the coin operator .",
    "the three - dimensional form of @xmath22 reads  @xcite @xmath23.\\ ] ] + then , the particle is moved by the conditional shift operator @xmath24 , expressed as  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 afterward the next step starts . during a single step , the position type @xmath10 is changed by the operator @xmath24 , so the particle will move in opposite directions in the following step .",
    "therefore this is a kind of `` flip - flop '' shift  @xcite .",
    "the time - evolution operator @xmath27 of the total system is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the identity operator acting on the position space . accordingly",
    "the system s state @xmath30 after @xmath31 steps is derived by applying @xmath27 on the initial state for @xmath31 times : @xmath32    the state vector @xmath30 can be expanded in terms of all the coin and position eigenkets as @xmath33 we introduce the vector @xmath34^{\\mathrm t},\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath35 means transpose .",
    "the probability of finding the particle at the position @xmath36 equals the squared norm of @xmath37 if its position is measured .",

    "substitute the results above into eq .",
    ", @xmath67 then the state ket in real space is derived by applying inverse dft to eq .  , @xmath68 specially , @xmath69    to further simplify the expression of @xmath70 , we first introduce a mathematical lemma .",

    ".   could be interpreted as a linear map from the initial state @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "the map is represented by a transformation matrix @xmath90 @xmath91 the matrix @xmath90 contains all the information about the walker s behavior at its starting point when @xmath1 .",
    "the existence of localization is directly related to the system s initial state via the matrix @xmath90 .",
    "the final form of @xmath90 is obtained by exploiting the results in eq .",

    "t}=[1,0,0]^{\\mathrm t}$ ] , which means the initial state of the coin is  moving along @xmath93 \" , the probability of finding the particle at the position @xmath47 after a great number of steps is @xmath94^{\\mathrm t}|^2=1/6 $ ] accordingly .",
    "apparently , the probability is not zero and the localization is revealed .",
    "we also conduct numerical simulations and the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ initialstate100 ] .",
    "a noticeable peak arises in the left of fig .",
    "[ initialstate100 ] .",
    "the right figure manifests the probability @xmath95 oscillates around our theoretical value @xmath96 and clearly exhibits a tendency to converge , indicating the walker does have a nonzero probability to be localized at its starting point .",
    "we have seen that the limit behavior of the grover walk is represented by eq .  .",
    "the probability @xmath64 is dependent on the coin s initial state @xmath49^{\\mathrm t}$ ] and it may decrease to zero under some circumstances . to verify this point , we work out the eigenvectors of @xmath90 : @xmath97 ,   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1 \\\\0 \\\\1\\end{array}\\right ] \\text { and } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1 \\\\2 \\\\-1\\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "so , if the initial coin state is @xmath100^{\\mathrm t}$ ] , the uniform superposition state of the three eigenstates without phase differences , named the grover state  @xcite , localization will disappear .",
    "numerical results are illustrated in the left of fig .",
    "[ minandmax ] and @xmath101 clearly converges to zero .",
    "it also manifests the grover state is the sole initial state causing the walker to be delocalized .",
    "this result is consistent with the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the maximal value of @xmath64 is @xmath102 .",
    "any initial coin state which is a linear combination of @xmath103^{\\mathrm t}$ ] and @xmath104^{\\mathrm t}$ ] will lead to the maximum .",
    "for example , when the initial state @xmath49^{\\mathrm t}=\\frac1{\\sqrt{3}}[1,e^{i2\\pi/3},e^{i4\\pi/3}]^{\\mathrm t}$ ] , @xmath64 will reach the maximal probability @xmath105 of localization ( fig .",
    "[ minandmax ] ) .",
    "this is totally different from the grover state above .          since the probability @xmath64 is dependent on the initial state of the coin ,",
    "what is the average probability if the initial state is generated randomly ?",
    "a random pure state of the coin can be obtained by applying a random unitary operator @xmath106 @xmath107 su(3 ) on an arbitrary coin state , such as @xmath17 ( see sec .  [ twospaces ] ) .",
    "the average probability is reasonably defined as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the haar measure of the group su(3 ) and @xmath110 , standing for the volume of su(3 ) . a unitary operator @xmath106 is usually expressed with the generators @xmath111 of su(3 ) and the angular parameters @xmath112 as  @xcite @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 . under this representation ,",
    "the haar measure @xmath109 of su(3 ) and the random initial state @xmath116 read  @xcite @xmath117 @xmath118 thus the average probability is obtained by finishing the integral in eq .  .",
    "the result is @xmath119    the result manifests that although a grover state coin will delocalize the quantum walker , the expected probability @xmath120 of localization for a random initial state @xmath121 is still up to @xmath122 if we measure the walker s position after even - t steps .",
    "thus the localization phenomenon happens very frequently in our model and it could be useful in designing some quantum algorithms .      apart from the initial coin state , it is obvious that the crucial point for the localization to occur is the existence of highly degenerate eigenvalue @xmath123 of the operator @xmath56 , which is in agreement with literature  @xcite .",
    "this characteristic is undoubtedly determined by grover s operator @xmath22 .",
    "if there is another coin operator @xmath21 leading to the eigenvalue @xmath123 of @xmath56 , the other two eigenvalues should also be like the form @xmath124 where @xmath60 is a function of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . according to lemma  [ th1 ] , these two terms in eq .",
    "usually contribute less to the system s limit behavior , and the term with eigenvalue 1 may give rise to localization .",
    "then what are the requirements for such a coin operator ?",
    "we find a sufficient condition .",
    "first , we extend the model of quantum walks on a honeycomb network in sec.[qwframework ] . in the grover",
    "walk , the operator @xmath21 is independent of position .",
    "we now release this restriction and let the coin operator be related to the position type .",
    "the time - evolution operator becomes @xmath125 consequently , the evolution operator @xmath56 in fourier space is modified , @xmath126    [ [ the - sufficient - condition ] ] * the sufficient condition : * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    if @xmath127 and the eigenvectors of @xmath21 are all real vectors ( overall phases are omitted ) , @xmath123 will be one of @xmath56 s eigenvalues and the localization is still present .",
    "the proof is given in appendix c. the grover walk we have studied above is a special case since @xmath128 . here",
    "we also give another example of the coin operator @xmath129.\\ ] ] @xmath130 looks much more like the three - dimensional version of hadamard matrix and @xmath130 satisfies all the conditions above .",
    "we take @xmath131 and @xmath132 with an initial coin state @xmath133^{\\mathrm t}$ ] and perform numerical simulations .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "[ h(1,0,0 ) ] , which obviously demonstrates that the walker has a nonzero probability to stay at its starting point when @xmath1 .",
    "specially if we additionally require all the eigenvalues of @xmath21 to be @xmath134 , then we will get the sufficient condition for localization when the coin operator is independent of positions .",
    "in this section , we consider another modified model in which the dimension of the coin space is enlarged to four .",
    "the additional fourth component represents not hopping , which means the walker is allowed to stay at its current position without moving . as a result",
    ", the shift operator now reads @xmath135 and the revised recursive relation is given as @xmath136 where the coin operator @xmath21 now should be the four - dimensional grover s operator g  @xcite @xmath137 the fourth coin basis state @xmath138 stands for `` not moving '' . similarly , the recursive relations in fourier space eq .   also change to @xmath139 with @xmath140 , which can be further expressed as @xmath141 therefore , @xmath142 where @xmath143 is an @xmath144 matrix .",

    "so the grover state is also the sole initial coin state that will delocalize the particle in four - state walks , which is shown in fig .",

    "( 8) of ref .",
    "it is obvious that our mathematical method with the transformation matrix @xmath90 is very convenient in studying localization phenomena in quantum walks .",
    "apart from the localization probability , another remarkable difference is that in 1d three - state walks , the limit state converges to a static wave function , while on a honeycomb network , the limit ket oscillates between two values .",
    "furthermore , the oscillation in four - state walks is not so palpable as that of three - state walks on the honeycomb network , since it results from the negative eigenvalue @xmath146 of @xmath145 , the evolution operator in fourier space .",
    "kollr _ et al_. in their previous work  @xcite investigated another model where the particle walks on a triangular lattice with a three - dimensional coin operator , similar to three - state quantum walks in this paper .",
    "the authors found when the coin operator is set to grover s operator , the walker still has a rapidly decaying probability to be localized at the origin .",
    "analyses suggest that coin operators leading to localization will transform quantum walks on a 2d plane to quantum walks on a quasi - one - dimensional line .",
    "in contrast , grover walks on a honeycomb network undoubtedly allow the appearance of localization , and we have also found many more coin operators leading to walker s localization in the previous section . besides , by comparing fig .",

    "in this paper , we have established a precise mathematical description of quantum walks on a honeycomb network and conducted a comprehensive and rigorous study on the localization effect .",
    "we first set the coin operator to grover s operator . with discrete fourier transformation",
    ", we analytically obtained the system s state vector .",
    "the localization probability in the limit of large number of steps is connected to the initial coin state through a concise transformation matrix @xmath90 , which completely contains all the information about the walker s limit behavior .",
    "we then analytically showed localization and delocalization .",
    "the results were all supported by numerical simulations .",
    "the average probability of localization s occurrence is @xmath202 if the system s initial state is randomly generated .",
    "other coin operators were also discussed and we derived a sufficient condition for localization .",
    "further , we extended the coin space to four and conducted parallel calculations , finding an oscillating limit state and deriving a larger probability .",
    "some other models in literature were reviewed .",
    "basing on the average probabilities , we concluded that the trapping effect of a honeycomb network is relatively strong .",
    "our mathematical method with the transformation matrix is very convenient to study localization in quantum walks .",
    "we numerically showed the walker s linear spreading property as well .    from discussions in the paper",
    ", we also see that the phase plays an important role in quantum walks and that is the most salient difference between classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "phase factors affect the degree of localization through the eigenvalues of operator @xmath56 , the initial state and eigenvectors of coin operator . in some previous experiments",
    "@xcite , quantum walks were implemented with only classical optics devices utilized , since classical electromagnetic wave can well imitate walker s de broglie wave .",
    "we therefore conclude that adapting phase differences and controlling interference relationship play essential roles in the appearance and disappearance of localization .",
    "quantum walks are often used to develop quantum algorithms .",
    "taking account of the broad choice of coin operators and vast studies in existing hexagonal 2d materials like graphene and h - bn , the localization property of quantum walks on a honeycomb network suggests its potential application in designing and implementing new algorithms on these materials .",
    "we also notice that the simple grover walk model can be extended by much more approaches , such as additional gates or vertex - dependent coin operators .",
