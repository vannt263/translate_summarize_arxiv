    "for data sets with class labels , association patterns @xcite that occur with disproportionate frequency in some classes versus others , can be of considerable value",
    ". we will refer to them as discriminative patterns @xcite in this paper , although these patterns have also been investigated under various names , such as emerging patterns @xcite , contrast sets @xcite and supervised descriptive rules @xcite .",
    "discriminative patterns have been shown to be useful for improving the classification performance @xcite and for discovering sample subgroups @xcite .",
    "the algorithms for finding discriminative patterns usually employ a measure for the discriminative power of a pattern .",
    "such measures are generally defined as a function of the pattern s relative support in the two classes , and can be defined either simply as the ratio @xcite or difference @xcite of the two supports , or other variations , such as information gain @xcite , gini index , or odds ratio  @xcite etc .",
    "to introduce some key ideas about discriminative patterns and make the following discussion easier to follow , we use the measure that is defined as the difference of the supports ( @xmath0 ) of an itemset in the two classes ( originally proposed in @xcite and used by its extensions  @xcite ) . consider figure  [ fig : toll ] , which displays a sample dataset containing @xmath1 items ( columns ) and two classes , each with 10 instances ( rows ) . in the figure , four patterns ( sets of binary variables ) can be observed : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are discriminative patterns whose @xmath0 is @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . in contrast",
    ", @xmath12 is not discriminative with a relatively uniform occurrence across the classes ( @xmath13 ) .    ,",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and an uninteresting ( non - discriminative ) pattern ( @xmath12),scaledwidth=60.0% ]    although @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are all considered to be discriminative because of their large @xmath0 , several observations can be made about their different characteristics .",
    "first , one of the two items in @xmath7 has an individual @xmath0 of @xmath9 ( @xmath14 ) , while the other item ( @xmath15 ) has a @xmath0 of @xmath16 .",
    "given that @xmath7 itself has a @xmath0 of @xmath10 , it is obvious that the discriminative power of the pattern is mainly driven by @xmath14 , while @xmath17 serves as a  passenger \" .",
    "such driver - passenger effects result from the fact that measures for discriminative power such as @xmath0 only capture the joint discrimination of a pattern but ignore the specific contribution from the items in the pattern .",
    "second , in contrast to @xmath7 , the @xmath0 values of the three individual items in @xmath6 are @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , which are much lower than the @xmath0 of @xmath6 itself ( 0.6 ) .",
    "this suggests that the items in @xmath6 have an incremental effect in their joint discriminative power .",
    "third , in contrast to both @xmath7 and @xmath6 , the three items in @xmath8 have @xmath0 values ( @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath9 ) , which are very similar to that of the pattern itself ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus , the three items in @xmath8 , as well as their combination , show a coherent behavior in their ability to differentiate between class @xmath20 and class @xmath21 .    patterns @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 have shown some of the characteristics of different types of _ _ interactions__. indeed , some characteristics of such interactions have been discussed and studied . in particular",
    ", we can consider the discriminative power of a pattern as the confidence of an association rule by considering the class label as a special item .",
    "then , the difference between the confidence of an association rule and the confidences of its subsets has been explored in the association rule mining community . specifically , bayardo et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a measure called _ improvement _ as the difference between the confidence of an association rule ( e.g. @xmath22 ) and the maximal confidence of its simplifications ( i.e. @xmath23 ) .",
    "the association rules that have positive improvement are called productive in @xcite and are considered to be more desirable than those rules with negative improvements .",
    "similar approaches have also been proposed in the context of discriminative patterns .",
    "garriga et al .",
    "@xcite studied the closeness of discriminative patterns and proposed to remove a discriminative pattern ( e.g. @xmath24 differentiates class 1 from class 2 by having higher support in class @xmath20 than in class @xmath21 ) if the support of @xmath24 is identical to any subset of @xmath24 in class @xmath21 , because such patterns are guaranteed to have non - positive improvements .",
    "to illustrate the concept of _ improvement _ and prepare for the following discussion , figure [ fig : mvsmax ] compares the discriminative power of a pattern with the best discriminative power of all its subsets , for all the frequent patterns ( @xmath25 ) in the hepatic dataset ( uci @xcite ) .",
    "three measures are used in the subfigures ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) respectively : support difference ( _ diffsup _ ) , @xmath26 statistic , and mutual information .",
    "the red line indicates @xmath27 , which separates the patterns that have positive _ improvement _ from those that have negative _ improvement_.",
    "a common observation consistent across the three subfigures is that , most patterns have at least one subset having higher discriminative power ( negative improvement ) .",
    "in contrast , a small proportion of patterns have much higher discriminative power compared with their subsets ( positive improvement ) .",
    "this contrast indicates that , although some combinations of items have a reasonably high joint association with a class variable , the actual amount of _ improvement _ can vary greatly from pattern to pattern .",
    "as shown by existing studies @xcite as well as by figure [ fig : mvsmax ] , adding constraints on _ improvement _ can reduce the number of interesting association and discriminative rules substantially .",
    "however , the current study of the different types of interactions in discriminative patterns is lacking in the following respects :    1 .   the type of interaction captured by _",
    "improvement _ is only one of several interesting types of interactions . in other words ,",
    "a discriminative pattern could have an interesting interaction even if it has a close - to - zero or even a negative _ improvement _ value .",
    "for example , pattern @xmath8 shown in figure [ fig : toll ] does not have an improvement of discriminative power compared to that of its subsets , and may simply be due to the existence of multiple redundant discriminative features .",
    "however , such coherent differentiation of three items may still be interesting in certain domains .",
    "specifically , in the field of differential gene - expression module discovery , a discriminative pattern like @xmath8 may indicate a functional module or protein complex .",
    "a specific example will be given in section [ sec : t2inter ] .",
    "2 .   even for the type of interactions captured by _ improvement _ ,",
    "a further understanding of the improvement in discriminative power is possible .",
    "for example , a large _ improvement _ can either result from an independent additive aggregation of several items with separate ( unrelated ) association with a class variable , or a synergistic aggregation beyond the independent addition .",
    "differentiating these different types of interactions ( section [ sec : intertypes ] ) can be useful for biomedical informatics because they generally lead to very different types of interpretation for a disease - genetic association @xcite . more generally , for other real - life applications , understanding different types of postive _ improvements _ can help us understand the discriminative structure of a dataset .",
    "aiming at a systematic understanding on the different types of interactions that are not captured by existing work , we motivate , formulate and design comprehensive experiments on the characterization of discriminative interactions from a general perspective of the discriminative pattern mining community .",
    "the major contributions of the paper are :    1 .",
    "we categorize discriminative patterns into four groups based on the following types of interactions : ( i ) driver - passenger , ( ii ) coherent , ( iii ) independent additive and ( iv ) synergistic beyond independent addition .",
    "we present and discuss the properties and utility of the four interaction types we define .",
    "we also discuss the relationship of the four pattern types to one another .",
    "we design comprehensive experiments on various types of real datasets including ten uci datasets , a gene expression dataset and two genetic variation ( snp ) datasets .",
    "the results demonstrate the existence , characteristics and statistical significance of the different types of patterns .",
    "they also illustrate how pattern characterization can provide novel insights into discriminative pattern mining and the discriminative structure of different datasets .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : intertypes ] , we discuss different types of interactions and define four types of discriminative patterns . in section [ sec : interresults ] , we describe the datasets and experimental results . related work on discriminative pattern mining is briefly summarized in section [ sec : interrelatedwork ] , followed by conclusions and future work in section [ sec : interconclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we describe four types of item interactions and categorize discriminative patterns into four groups correspondingly .",
    "we also investigate their properties and their relationship to one another .",
    "first we describe some terminologies that will be used through the rest of the section .",
    "let @xmath8 be a dataset with a set of items , @xmath28 , two class labels @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and a set of @xmath31 labeled instances ( transactions ) , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a set of items and @xmath34 is the class label for @xmath35 .",
    "the two sets of instances that respectively belong to the class @xmath29 and @xmath30 are denoted by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and we have @xmath38 . for an itemset @xmath39 , the set of instances in @xmath8 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 that contain @xmath40 are denoted by @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "let @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 be support of @xmath40 in @xmath8 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , all relative to the entire set of transactions , i.e. @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath53 be @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "we use mutual information ( mi ) as representative measure for discriminative power among many others such as the support ratio , support difference and @xmath56-statistic shown in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "this is because @xmath57 is based on information theory , which makes one of the interaction measures to be presented later easy to interpret .",
    "the @xmath57 between an itemset @xmath40 and the class variable @xmath7 is computed as follows :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "note that , in this paper , @xmath57 is always normalized by the entropy of the class variable ( @xmath65 ) , after which , it ranges from @xmath16 to @xmath20 .      pattern @xmath7 shown in section [ sec : intro ] is an illustration of discriminative patterns with a driver - passenger interaction , where the driver and the passenger are both a single item in the pattern . more generally , any discriminative pattern with a subset having similar discriminative power as the entire pattern while another disjoint subset in the pattern showing weak discriminative power are considered to have a _ driver - passenger _ interaction .",
    "formally , we define the discriminative patterns with this type of interaction ( t1 ) as follows :    * definition 1 * : an itemset @xmath40 is a t1 discriminative pattern if the following criteria are met together for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 : @xmath69 criterion ( a ) is a general requirement of the discriminative power of an itemset , which will also be used in the definition of the other types of discriminative patterns . criteria ( b ) and ( c ) require the existence of at least one driver and at least one passenger in @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "similar to @xmath7 in figure [ fig : toll ] , @xmath70 discriminative patterns are generally not interesting because the passengers are included in a pattern as a purely mathematical consequence rather than an interpretable relationship with the other items in the pattern .",
    "thus , in the rest of the paper , we will focus on the other three types of interactions that can serve as evidence of meaningful relationship among the items in a pattern .",
    "the illustrative pattern @xmath8 in figure [ fig : toll ] represents a type of interaction in which every item in a pattern is contributing with a discriminative power similar to that of the entire pattern .",
    "we call this a _ coherent interaction _ , and refer to patterns having this type of interaction t2 patterns .    *",
    "definition 2 * : an itemset @xmath40 is a t2 discriminative pattern if the following criteria are met together for @xmath66 , @xmath67 : @xmath71 the _ incoherence _ in criterion ( b ) is calculated as the range of values in @xmath72 .",
    "criteria ( a ) and ( b ) capture the unique property of this type of coherent interaction , i.e. each individual item in a pattern has similar ( controlled by @xmath73 ) discriminative power as the pattern itself . given that @xmath57 does not indicate the direction of the differentiation ( i.e. a pattern or an item can be either more frequent in class @xmath29 or more frequent in class @xmath30 ) , criterion ( c ) is further used to make sure that all the items in a pattern have the same differentiating directionality as the pattern itself .",
    "figure [ fig : t2onadult ] illustrate the existence of t2 discriminative patterns with a real gene expression dataset .",
    "each circle represents a pattern .",
    "the circles above the horizontal line meet criterion ( a ) , and the circles on the left of the vertical line meet the criterion ( b ) .",
    "criterion ( c ) is implicitly enforced in the generation of the figure .",
    "the circles in the upper - left corner are @xmath74 discriminative patterns .",
    "note that the definition of different type of interactions is with respect to the specified parameters ( here @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , rather than a clear - cut separation . with different parameter values , different set of patterns will be considered to have a certain interaction .",
    "the essential difference between t1 and t2 discriminative patterns is that t1 patterns include passengers ( guaranteed by the criterion ( c ) in definition 1 ) , while t2 patterns do not include passengers ( guaranteed by the criterion ( b ) in definition 2 ) .",
    "this difference is what distinguishes t1 , an uninteresting type of discriminative pattern , from t2 , a a potentially interesting type of discriminative pattern .",
    "specifically , if a dataset has many @xmath74 discriminative patterns , we can speculate that it contains features that are discriminative and correlated with each other",
    ". such correlation may either be due to the existence of multiple discriminative features that are redundant with each other ( uninteresting ) , or may correspond to a functional module or protein complex that is associated with a disease in the context of differential gene - module discovery .",
    "for instance , figure [ fig : gustavopatt ] illustrates a t2 pattern discovered from the gene expression dataset of a study on breast cancer @xcite ( section [ sec : datasets ] ) .",
    "the genes in the pattern ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) demonstrate similar type of differentiating effect as @xmath7 .",
    "discovering such patterns rather than the individual items separately could provide valuable insights towards the understanding of gene interactions in complex diseases .",
    "indeed , three genes in the pattern ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) have been associated with breast cancer specifically , and the other one ( @xmath82 ) was identified as a general tumor - related gene @xcite .",
    "these facts suggest that the genes in the pattern may correspond to a functional module or protein complex .",
    "in addition to coherent interaction , another type of interesting interaction in biomedical and genetic domains is a pattern containing a set of items ( e.g. genes ) that has better discriminative power than any of its subsets .",
    "pattern @xmath6 illustrates such an example , i.e. the three individual items are not discriminative by themselves while they have a 100% prediction confidence as a combination .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , this type of interaction can be captured by existing measures such as _ improvement _ , which is defined to be the difference between the discriminative power ( e.g. mi ) between a pattern and its best subset . however , a deeper understanding of the characteristics of the improvement in discriminative power is possible .",
    "for example , for pattern @xmath6 in figure [ fig : toll ] , the large _ improvement _ can either result from an independent additive aggregation of several items with separate ( unrelated ) association , or a synergistic aggregation beyond the independent addition .",
    "differentiating these different types of interactions is important because they generally lead to very different types of interpretation of a disease association .",
    "next , we will first discuss two different types of improvement interactions and then define another two types of discriminative patterns accordingly .",
    "bayardo et al .",
    "@xcite defined _ improvement _ in the context of association rule mining based on the _ confidence _ of a rule .",
    "we first rewrite the _ improvement _ ( @xmath83 ) in the context of discriminative pattern mining based on mi as below :    @xmath84    to ease the motivation of different types of _ improvement _ , we consider the following equation for a pair of items @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86    which is essentially the amount of additional information about the class variable @xmath7 that can be provided by the two items as a combination , compared to the information that each item can provide ( the bigger one ) .",
    "this additional amount of information can either result from an independent additive aggregation of several items with separate ( unrelated ) association , or a synergistic aggregation beyond the independent addition .",
    "d. anastassiou @xcite applied a measure called _ synergy _ ( originally used in neuroscience literature @xcite ) to discover gene - gene interactions that are beyond the independent addition of all possible partitions of its subsets . in this paper , we leverage it to characterize discriminative patterns from a more general perspective .",
    "we start from the following equation for calculating the synergy computation between a size-@xmath21 pattern @xmath85 and a class variable @xmath7 ,    @xmath87    which is calculated as the amount of additional information about the class variable @xmath7 that can be provided by the two items as a combination , compared to the information that each of the item can provide independently ( sum of the two individual @xmath88 ) .",
    "compared to equation [ eq : imp_cmi_pair ] , the essential difference between _ improvement _ and _ synergy _ is that , _ improvement _ is with respect to the bigger @xmath57 of the two , while _ synergy _ is compared to the summation of @xmath88 of the two .",
    "indeed , the summation of the mutual information of two items is used in information theory to represent the combined effect of two items with independent association with a class variable @xcite .",
    "thus , _ synergy _ can be leveraged to refine the discriminative patterns with positive _ improvement _ , based on the characteristics of an improvement .    in order to provide",
    "an intuitive understanding , figure [ fig : gi_motivation_costanzo ] illustrates an underlying mechanism of synergistic interaction in the context of yeast genetic interaction .",
    "two distinct pathways are shown in the figure , i.e. @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which impinge on a common biological process that is essential to the survival of a yeast cell ( the wild type ) . due to parallel structure",
    ", the two pathways can compensate for the loss of the other , and thus a genetic perturbation ( natural variations ) on either of the two pathways separately ( e.g. perturbation only in @xmath6 ) fails to cause any observable defects in cell survival .",
    "the simultaneous perturbations in @xmath6 and @xmath91 disrupt both pathways and result in the lethality the cell . in this example",
    ", @xmath6 and @xmath91 have a synergistic interaction with respect to the class label ( survival or not ) of a cell .",
    "equation [ eq : synergy_general ] gives the general definition of _ synergy _ for an itemset @xmath40 beyond pairs ( also defined in @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath92    where a partition is defined as a collection @xmath93 of disjoint subsets @xmath94 whose union is @xmath40 .",
    "for example , for a size-@xmath95 pattern(@xmath96 ) ,    @xmath97    this generalized definition is consistent with the intuition that _ synergy _ is the additional amount of information about a class variable provided by an integrated discriminative power compared with what can be best achieved after breaking the pattern into components by the sum of the contributions of these components .",
    "the partition of the set of factors that is chosen in this formula is the one that maximizes the sum of the amounts of mutual information connecting the subsets in that partition with the class variable , and we will refer to it as the _ best aggregated mi_. note that , the computational complexity of _ synergy _ for an itemset of size @xmath31 is @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the @xmath100 bell number , which increases in a dramatically fast speed . in practice , to avoid unnecessary computations , we actually only need to compute _ synergy _ ( as well as _",
    "best aggregated mi _ ) for those patterns with positive _ improvement _ , which is much more efficient to compute , i.e @xmath101 . given the definition of _ improvement _ and _ synergy _ , it is easy to notice that _ synergy _ is guaranteed to be larger than _ improvement _ ( follows from the fact that mi is non - negative .",
    "proof omitted ) . essentially , _",
    "synergy _ is a more restrictive measure specifically for capturing interaction beyond independent addition .",
    "figure [ fig : t3t4tild ] compares how _ improvement _ and _ synergy _ capture the interaction of discriminative patterns discovered from a gene expression dataset ( described in section [ subsec : expresults ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : t3inter_pre ] shows the @xmath57 and best subset @xmath57 of the discriminative patterns as a scatter plot .",
    "the horizontal dashed line indicates the cutoff values for @xmath57 , and the other dashed line ( representing @xmath102 ) separate the patterns with @xmath57 higher than best subset @xmath57 ( positive _ improvement _ ) with those that have negative _ improvement_. as shown , there are quite a few patterns above both the horizontal line and @xmath102 , with size ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath103 .",
    "in contrast to figure [ fig : t3inter_pre ] , the x - axis in figure [ fig : t4inter_pre ] is _",
    "best aggregated mi _ instead of _ best subset mi_. corresponding to this difference , there are far fewer discriminative patterns ( all of size-@xmath21 ) that are above both the horizontal line ( high discriminative power ) and @xmath102 ( positive synergy ) at the same time .",
    "this contrast is as expected given our discussion above that _ synergy _ is a more restrictive type of interaction beyond the independent additive effect , and is guaranteed to be no more than _ improvement _ for any pattern .      with _ synergy",
    "_ , we can divide all discriminative patterns with positive _ improvement _ into two groups .",
    ", i.e. those that have negative _ synergy _ and those that have positive _ synergy_. alternatively , the two groups can also be defined as those patterns that have positive _ improvement _ ( including both positive and negative _ synergy _ ) and those that specifically have positive _ synergy_. we take the latter route , given its simplicity in term of the definitions as shown below . note that the observations made from both routes are essentially the same .",
    "* definition 3 * : an itemset @xmath40 is a t3 discriminative pattern if the following criteria are met together for @xmath66 , @xmath67 : @xmath104 * definition 4 * : an itemset @xmath40 is a t4 discriminative pattern if the following criteria are met together for @xmath66 , @xmath67 : @xmath105 for illustration , we note that pattern @xmath6 in figure [ fig : toll ] is a @xmath106 discriminative pattern , with @xmath107 , individual item @xmath108 0.007 , 0.008 , and 0.029 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath109-improvement is 0.18 , while the synergy is 0.17 .",
    "if a dataset has many @xmath110 discriminative patterns , we can speculate that it contains features that complement each other for higher discriminative power in their association with the class variable .",
    "further , if there are also many @xmath106 discriminative patterns , it is expected that some features have synergistic cooperative effect beyond independent addition .",
    "in contrast , if a dataset has few or no @xmath110 discriminative patterns , the discriminative features , if they exist in the dataset , are expected to be either correlated with each other ( @xmath74 ) or not form high - order combinations at all , i.e. , have a very low joint frequency to pass the support threshold .",
    "figure [ fig : t3t4grid ] shows the two sets of patterns : t3 ( upper right region in figure [ fig : t3inter_def ] ) and t4 ( upper right region in figure [ fig : t4inter_def ] ) respectively , both with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "note that , there are only two patterns ( size-@xmath21 ) that have _ synergy _ greater than @xmath76 .",
    "this again indicates that the synergistic interaction in t4 patterns is rare .",
    "however , as will be shown in section [ subsec : expresults ] , these two @xmath106 patterns ( even very rare ) are statistically significant after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing to control type i error ( false discover rate @xmath111 ) , and thus can be of significant interest in the biomedical domain .",
    "after all , @xmath76 is an arbitrary threshold that is used to illustrate the concept .",
    "in fact , there are many other discriminative patterns with positive synergy ( even though they are below @xmath112 ) as shown in figure [ fig : t4inter_def ] , which may also be interesting to specific domains .",

    "the fact that they have a synergistic interaction agrees with their closely related functions and potential compensation for each other as illustrated in figure [ fig : gi_motivation_costanzo ] .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the relationships among different types of interactions and relate other types of interactions to the four defined interactions in order to have a systematic understanding about item interactions in discriminative patterns .",
    "figure [ fig : vennconcept ] shows the three interesting types of discriminative patterns ( t2 , t3 and t4 ) in the context of all discriminative patterns using a venn diagram .",
    "the outermost circle contains all the discriminative patterns with @xmath119 .",
    "the set of @xmath110 discriminative patterns is a superset of the set of @xmath106 patterns based on the definitions 3 and 4 ( with the same @xmath40 and @xmath73 ) and the fact that _ synergy _ is always no more than _ improvement _ for any pattern .",
    "the set of @xmath74 discriminative patterns is disjoint with the set of @xmath110 patterns , when the same value of @xmath73 is used in definitions 2 and 3 .",
    "specifically , for any given value of @xmath73 , criterion ( b ) in definition 2 and criterion ( b ) in definition 3 can not be met at the same time .",
    "the next natural question is the nature of the discriminative patterns that are not any of the three types ( t2 , t3 and t4 ) , i.e. the region represented by the gray background color .",
    "indeed , they can all be considered to be in one of the two possible cases : either ( i ) t1 patterns with the driver - passenger interaction or ( ii ) the patterns , each of which can be considered as a combination is a t2 pattern and @xmath120 is a t3 pattern , then @xmath121 is a combiantion of t2 and t3 pattern . ] of t2 and t3 patterns . due to the limit of space ,",
    "the prove of this is available on the paper website .",
    "note that , the goal of characterizing discriminative patterns with different types of interactions is to identify different types of interesting discriminative patterns , which are specifically @xmath122 in the context of this paper .",
    "it is worth noting that we do not exclude the possibility that the patterns in the gray region ( @xmath70 patterns , or combinations of @xmath74 and @xmath110 patterns ) may also be interesting in some specific domains even though they are not considered as such in this paper .",
    "thus the focus of this paper is to initiate a study of the item interactions in discriminative patterns , rather than identifying the all possible types of interesting item interactions in discriminative patterns .     and",
    "@xmath73.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      as discussed by recent work @xcite , an association pattern mining task ( e.g. frequent patterns , discriminative patterns ) essentially conducts a large number of hypothesis testing .",
    "thus , in order to control type i error ( due to the multiple hypothesis testing ) , corrections on the significance of the discovered patterns is necessary . among different approaches for correcting multiple hypothesis testing , the randomization based approaches @xcite are non - parametric and thus more reliable in term of not introducing bias .",
    "randomization frameworks have been extensively explored in the context of frequent pattern mining and clustering @xcite . for discriminative pattern mining , a special type of randomization procedure",
    "is needed , in which the randomization is performed by shuffling the class labels for the samples . for the details of the randomization and the calculation of corrected p - value or false discovery rate ( fdr ) ,",
    "refer to @xcite . in section [ subsec : expresults ]",
    ", we will show that many of the discovered @xmath122 patterns are statistically significant after correcting for multiple hypothesis tests .",
    "in this section , we use a variety of real datasets to demonstrate the existence , properties and statistical significance of different types of discriminative patterns that we characterized in section [ sec : intertypes ] .",
    "we also show how the characterization can provide novel insights into discriminative pattern mining and the discriminative pattern structure of different datasets , beyond those provided by current approaches that focus mostly on pattern - based classification and subgroup discovery .",
    "we use the following three different types of real datasets , with details summarized in table [ table : datasets ] and detailed pre - processing steps described on the paper website :    * ten uci datasets * @xcite with a variety of dimensions and densities ( table [ table : datasets ] ) .    *",
    "a gene expression dataset * on breast cancer @xcite ( pre - processed as suggested in @xcite and binarized as done in @xcite .",
    "we denote this dataset by breast(gep ) .    *",
    "two single - nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) datasets * : snp profile captures the genetic variations of a person at single - nucleotide resolution , which are commonly used in disease - association studies @xcite .",
    "the diseases studied with these two datasets are myeloma @xcite and lung cancer @xcite respectively .",
    "we denote these two datasets by m - survival(snp ) and lung(snp ) .",
    ".details of each dataset and a summary of the number of different types of discriminative patterns discovered . for column @xmath123 , in addition to the number of discovered patterns , we also show ( in the bracket ) the number of unique items in the union of the set of patterns to reflect the redundancy among the patterns . @xmath75 and @xmath124",
    "are used for all the datasets . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      for each dataset , we first discover a set of discriminative patterns with existing algorithms .",
    "specifically , for the dense and high dimensional datasets ( breast ( gep ) , the two snp datasets , chess ( uci ) and hypo ( uci ) ) , we leverage the smp algorithm proposed in @xcite to discover discriminative patterns ( @xmath125 ) . for the other sparse or low - dimensional datasets we simply use fpc @xcite with @xmath25 , because smp may miss some high - support patterns although it is efficient on discovering discriminative patterns from dense and high - dimensional data @xcite .    for each set of discovered patterns ( only closed itemsets )",
    ", we apply the criteria of the three types of discriminative patterns ( @xmath122 ) presented in section [ sec : intertypes ] and get the number of patterns for each type .",
    "figures [ fig : t2t3t4uci ] illustrate the existence of t2 , t3 and t4 discriminative patterns in the representative snp dataset ( subfigures ( a)-(c ) ) , and the representative uci datasets ( subfigures ( d)-(f ) ) .",
    "note that , the similar set of figures for the gene expression dataset can be found in section [ sec : t3t4now ] , i.e. figures [ fig : t2onadult ] , [ fig : t3inter_def ] and [ fig : t4inter_def ] .",
    "+    several observations about each type of interactions can be made from table [ table : datasets ] and figure [ fig : t2t3t4uci ] .",
    "* 1 : t2 discriminative patterns are common in most uci datasets and the gene expression dataset , but not in the snp datasets : * on one hand , this indicates that the uci datasets and the gene expression dataset have features that are discriminative and correlated with each other . on the other hand , the fact that the snp datasets do not have t2 patterns indicates that the discriminative snps are not correlated with each other .",
    "in addition , column @xmath126 in table [ table : datasets ] indicates that the across - pattern redundancy is high in @xmath74 patterns , i.e. the number of unique items is generally much smaller than the number of patterns . * 2 : t3 discriminative patterns exist in about half of the uci datasets and all three of the biological datasets : * these datasets are expected to contain discriminative features that are complementary to each other in their improved discriminative power as a pattern .",
    "in contrast , the other datasets that have very few or no @xmath110 discriminative patterns , the discriminative features , if they exist in the dataset , are expected to be either correlated with each other ( @xmath74 ) such as cleve ( uci ) or simply do not contain interesting feature combinations ( independent association with the class variable ) such as mushroom and waveform .",
    "the fact that the three biological datasets have many @xmath110 discriminative patterns is consistent with common knowledge that complex diseases involve the cooperation of multiples genes .",
    "this is especially true for the the two snp datasets , where there are no @xmath74 discriminative patterns but many @xmath110 discriminative interactions .",
    "in addition , column @xmath127 shows that the across - pattern redundancy in @xmath110 patterns is lower than in @xmath74 patterns , because the number of unique items is generally similar as the number of patterns .",
    "* 3 : t4 discriminative patterns exist in all three of the biological datasets and only one uci dataset ( sonar ) : * first , t4 pattern is rare because @xmath106 is based on the most restrictive type of interaction ( _ synergy _ ) .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the gene expression and snp datasets contain many @xmath106 discriminative patterns indicates the relatively higher complexity in genetic datasets compared to the common uci datasets .",
    "in addition , column @xmath128 shows that the across - pattern redundancy in @xmath106 patterns is similar as in @xmath110 patterns , which are both lower than in @xmath74 patterns .    *",
    "4 : the number of @xmath122 patterns is much smaller compared to the overall number of discriminative patterns : * the last column in table [ table : datasets ] shows the fraction of discriminative patterns that are either @xmath74 , @xmath110 or @xmath106 ( the three interesting types ) . except for the two snp datasets ,",
    "the fractions are generally very low , which indicate that many discriminative patterns with good discriminative power are not interesting from the perspective of the interestingness considered in this paper .",
    "the extreme cases are the mushroom and waveform datasets , which do not contain any of the three types of patterns .",
    "this indicates that the discriminative features are neither uncorrelated with each other nor complementary to each other in these two datasets , i.e. independently discriminative features .",
    "this observation indicates that the actual number of interesting patterns is much more manageable compared to the huge number of patterns that are generally encountered without a detailed characterization .",
    "* 5 : @xmath122 patterns generally have smaller size compared to the entire set of discriminative patterns : * from the color of the circles in the figures , @xmath122 patterns are generally of size @xmath129 .",
    "this is in contrast to the wider range of sizes for the entire set of discriminative patterns , which can be as high as @xmath130 .",
    "this agrees with the observations made in the recent work on constraint - based generation of high - order discriminative patterns @xcite .",
    "specifically , steinbach et al . observed that the larger ( size ) an itemset becomes , the harder it is for the itemset to meet the constraints for a discriminative pattern , when the constraints are not only on the discriminative power of the pattern but also the _ improvement _ of the discriminative power .",
    "this also suggests that the computational complexity of discriminative pattern mining could be less than expected given that too large patterns tend to be uninteresting in term of the meaningful relationships scoped in this paper .    *",
    "6 : @xmath122 patterns discovered from all the datasets are statistically significant*. in the columns @xmath123 in table [ table : datasets ] , all the @xmath122 patterns are statistically significant with @xmath131 after correcting for multiple hypothesis tests to control type i error ( method discussed in section [ sec : interfdr ] ) .",
    "specifically for the three biological datasets , the characterization of those statistically significant gene or snp combinations can assist the further biological interpretations , and reveal novel insights to the mechanisms of complex diseases .",
    "the above comprehensive observations illustrate the existence , characteristics and statistical significance of the different types of patterns .",
    "they also illustrate how the proposed framework can provide novel insights into discriminative pattern mining and the discriminative pattern structure of different datasets .",
    "over the past decade , many approaches have studied discriminative patterns and related topics .",
    "the most relevant related work was discussed earlier in section [ sec : intro ] . among other work focusing on mining discriminative patterns , the most relevant ones are @xcite .",
    "many existing approaches also used discriminative pattern for classification @xcite .",
    "additional related papers in the area include @xcite .",
    "we also refer the readers to a comprehensive survey on discriminative patterns by novak et al . @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we categorized discriminative patterns into four groups based on item interactions : ( i ) driver - passenger , ( ii ) coherent , ( iii ) independent additive and ( iv ) synergistic beyond independent addition .",
    "the coherent , additive , and synergistic patterns are of practical importance , with the latter two representing a gain in the discriminative power of a pattern over its subsets .",
    "synergistic patterns are most restrictive , but perhaps the most interesting since they capture a cooperative effect that is more than the sum of the effects of the individual items in the pattern .",
    "the experiments provided a number of insights into the nature of discriminative patterns in various real datasets and the characteristics of the different types of patterns .",
    "particularly worth noting is that all types @xmath122 patterns were significant in all the datasets for which we evaluated pattern significance . while this needs to be investigated further , we believe that this is mostly due to the pruning of a large number of patterns that are not likely to be of interest . without such pruning , the number of patterns is typically very large , as is typical in most types of association analysis , and thus , the fdr of the resulting patterns tends to be low unless the patterns are very strong since fdr depends very heavily on the number of patterns being considered .",
    "we are hopeful that this observation will allow discriminative pattern mining to be more effectively used for a wide variety of applications , both in the biomedical area and beyond .",
    "several further directions can be explored in the future .",
    "( 1 ) the four types of patterns defined in the paper are mainly based on the building - block measure _ mutual information _ to make the presentation consistent and easy to follow , and other statistical measusres can also be explored as building - block measures or specifically for a certain type of pattern .",
    "for instance , the logistic regression - based measure studied in @xcite can be leveraged as an alternative to _ synergy _ , ( 2 ) other types of interactions can be explored especially those that may be interesting to specific domain but are considered as non - interesting in the context of this paper .",
    "( 3 ) from the computational perspective , it is also interesting to design mining algorithms that can directly search for a particular type of discriminative patterns , which is expected to be much faster given a more specific definition , whose anti - monotonic properties can be leveraged as additional pruning constraints .",
