    "channel capacity is the maximum rate at which one can transmit over a channel which can guarantee an arbitrarily small probability of error in transmission .",
    "however , channel capacity can be achieved as closely as required with codes of very large codeword lengths . but large codewords require more time units to transmit . therefore it is useful to know the variation of the maximum rate at which one can transmit as a function of channel parameters and codeword length ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finite blocklength results were first studied for discrete memoryless channels ( dmc ) by strassen @xcite which were asymptotically tight upto the second order term .",
    "these were further refined by polyanskiy et .",
    "@xcite wherein the third order term was further refined for discrete memoryless channels and additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels .",
    "moreover in @xcite , a general form of finite blocklength achievability bound and converse bound ( also known as the meta - converse ) were developed .",
    "the techniques used were based on a binary / multiple hypothesis testing model and were shown to recover several previously known achievability and converse bounds .",
    "further improvements in the third order terms for dmc were given by tomamichel and tan in @xcite .",

    "the study of energy harvesting channels is motivated by wireless sensor networks ( see @xcite ) . when a sensor node needs to communicate with another node ,",
    "energy is expended to transmit symbols .",
    "the energy required can come from a battery or an energy harvesting system which is a system that gathers energy from some ambient source . a channel which uses an energy harvesting system has been of interest recently due to advances in wireless sensor networks @xcite .",
    "a survey on information theoretic and queuing theoretic results on energy harvesting systems may be found in @xcite , @xcite . the capacity of an energy harvesting awgn channel was obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finite - blocklength achievable rate analysis for energy harvesting channels was studied for noiseless binary channels by yang in @xcite and for dmc and awgn channels with infinite buffer by fong , et .",

    "if we restrict the blocklength , the achievable rates are less than the capacity of the channel .",
    "we define the backoff from capacity , as the difference between the channel capacity and the achievable rate as a function of codeword length . in @xcite , the backoff from capacity for an energy harvesting awgn channel with infinite buffer and harvest - use - store architecture ( hus )",
    "is shown to be @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the codeword length . in this paper , we show that a backoff of @xmath2 is possible for any @xmath3 . our framework is similar to that of @xcite wherein we have an energy gathering phase where no symbols are transmitted followed by a transmission phase .",
    "the difference is that in our error analysis , we separate these two phases and bound the error terms individually as opposed to together .",
    "this allows us to use kolmogorov s maximal inequality to upper bound the outage event leading to a simplified analysis .",
    "moreover we are able to improve the coefficient of @xmath4 ( third order term ) in the finite blocklength expression via berry esseen s theorem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ prem ] , we provide the notation and recall some known results for awgn as well as energy harvesting awgn channels .",
    "we also state the main theorem of this paper . in section [ proo ]",

    "section [ conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "we first define awgn channels with and without energy harvesting and provide the corresponding capacity results .",
    "we develop notation along the way .",
    "an awgn channel is characterized by an input @xmath5 and output @xmath6 at time @xmath7 and an input average power constraint @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) normal random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath11 .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the joint normal distribution with mean @xmath13 and covariance matrix @xmath14 . for any input @xmath15 , given @xmath1 channel uses ,",
    "the power constraint is formally given by @xmath16 .",
    "thus the awgn channel can be represented by the probability density function @xmath17 where the norm is the @xmath18 norm .",
    "its capacity is given by @xmath19 according to @xcite ( also see @xcite ) , the maximal code size @xmath20 with average error probability @xmath21 for this channel is given as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the channel dispersion parameter given by @xmath25    in this set up , the transmitter is only subject to an average power constraint .",
    "however if we were to look at the channel with energy harvesting ( eh - awgn ) , the average power constraint will be replaced by the appropriate energy harvesting constraints .",
    "we expect a similar result for the eh - awgn channel however the expressions in ( [ fcap1 ] ) would change .",
    "the harvest - use - store ( hus ) model for awgn is described in @xcite .",
    "the energy harvesting system consists of a queue or buffer , which may be understood as a rechargeable battery .",
    "this buffer is recharged by an energy harvesting process .",
    "[ fi1 ] shows the overall system setup .        in this model",
    ", there is an infinite buffer to store the harvested energy .",
    "let @xmath26 be the energy harvested and @xmath27 be the energy in the buffer at time @xmath7 .",

    "we shall choose @xmath52 and @xmath53 towards the end of the proof .",

    "note that the transmitted codeword satisfies the energy harvesting conditions , since @xmath53 energy has already been harvested before the transmission started .",
    "the decoder ignores the output of the channel for the first @xmath52 channel uses as those are for harvesting energy . during the transmission stage , i.e. from the @xmath62st stage onwards ,",
    "it retrieves the output of the channel @xmath63 and then decodes the unique message @xmath64 such that @xmath65 where @xmath66+\\sigma^2)\\mathbf{i}_n)$ ] .",
    "we choose @xmath67 later .",
    "if such a message ca nt be found , the decoder randomly picks one of @xmath48 possible messages .",
    "this decoder is known as the threshold decoder @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "denote by @xmath68 the event that an error happens .",
    "due to symmetry in the codebook construction , it suffices to assume that message 1 is sent .",
