    "the research related to quantum optics of nanoscale systems is strongly influenced by the availability of simple and transparent theoretical tools and models that allow in - depth understanding of the pertinent phenomena in sufficiently simple form .",
    "such insight has been used , for instance , in the recent demonstrations and studies of noiseless but nondeterministic optical amplifiers @xcite and optical properties of cavities @xcite .",
    "simple description of the quantum aspects of energy transfer is especially interesting and challenging in lossy nanoscale systems often simulated by the prototypical one - dimensional lossy structures .",
    "the research of quantum optical processes in such lossy systems during the last few decades has generated a wealth of information on the quantization of the electromagnetic ( em ) field in dielectrics and especially in layered structures . in the context of the present work ,",
    "the most relevant quantization approach has focused on the input ",
    "output relation formalism ( iorf ) of the photon creation and annihilation operators providing a detailed description of the spatial field evolution .",
    "the formalism was originally developed for dispersionless and lossless dielectrics by knll _",
    "_ @xcite and soon extended for lossy and dispersive media for the study of passive optical devices , such as dielectric plates , interfaces , and optical cavities by several groups @xcite .",
    "the complete quantization procedures studied , e.g. , by barnett _",
    "_ @xcite fully accounting for the coupling between the em field and the states of homogeneous lossy media clearly highlighted that the noise and field operators in lossy systems became position dependent .",
    "the vector potential and electric field operators in the above works obeyed the well - known canonical commutation relation for an arbitrary choice of normal mode functions as expected @xcite , but the commutation relations of the ladder operators did not .",
    "the anomalous commutation relations of the ladder operators were studied in several reports @xcite but no clear resolution for the anomalies was found apart from reaching a consensus that the anomalies were irrelevant as long as the field commutation relations and classical field quantities were well defined . since then , the iorf has mainly been applied in calculating the classical field quantities until the very recent suggestions that , despite the early interpretations , the ladder operators and their commutation relations might in fact relate to measurable physical properties @xcite .    in this paper , we define position - dependent ladder operators associated with the vector potential in a way that is consistent with the canonical commutation relations .",
    "the introduced position - dependent annihilation and photon - number operators give further insight on the local effective photon number , thermal balance , and the formation of the local thermal equilibrium .",
    "we focus on thermal source fields , but in principle the introduced operators also allow one to investigate fields with other kinds of quantum statistics .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of dividing the photon number into left and right propagating parts , and the origin of the anomalies reported in cavity operators based on this division .",
    "the approach that is initially based on purely mathematical arguments is also shown to result in a physically meaningful definition of the photon number that has a very attractive and simple connection to the field temperature and thermal balance of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] the theoretical background is briefly reviewed and the position - dependent ladder and photon - number operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations are defined . to enable comparison between the conventional field operators and the position - dependent photon - number operator we",

    "in addition , we show how the introduced effective photon - number operator is related to the thermal balance of the system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the presented theoretical concepts are applied to study the position dependence of the photon number , electric field fluctuation , electrical contribution of the local density of em states , energy density , poynting vector , and net emission rate in the geometries of an interface separating a lossy medium from vacuum and a vacuum cavity between lossy media .",
    "field quantization in lossy dielectrics is well established , but for the purposes of the present discussion it is convenient to briefly review some of the key results and theoretical background for the quantization of the em field in one dimension . in this section ,",

    "the positivity of the poynting vector denotes net energy transfer towards the medium at lower temperature . inside the lossy media ,",
    "the poynting vector asymptotically reaches zero far from the interfaces .",
    "the damping of the poynting vector is faster in the right medium than in the left medium due to the larger imaginary part of the refractive index .",
    "the net emission rate is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab](f ) .",
    "again the net emission rate is zero in the vacuum and it decays to zero inside the lossy media .",
    "positive ( negative ) values denote that the rate of photon emission ( absorption ) outweighs the rate of photon absorption ( emission ) . the higher absolute value of the net emission rate in the lossy medium with higher imaginary part of the refractive index is related to larger loss and the faster damping of the poynting vector in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab](e ) . in the presence of small losses inside the cavity (",
    "not shown ) the net emission rate exhibits oscillations similar to the oscillations of the electric ldos in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab](c ) .",
    "this directly reflects the purcell effect and position - dependent emission rate of particles placed in the cavity .",
    "the proposed position - dependent ladder and photon - number operators predict that the effective photon numbers oscillate with respect to the positions as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : semi](a ) and [ fig : slab](a ) .",
    "in contrast to the field quantities , the effective photon number provides a simple metric for finding the thermal balance formed due to interactions taking place through the electric field and electric dipoles as detailed in eq .  .",
    "since the photon number as defined in this work is also expected to be directly related both to local temperature and rate of energy exchange taking place between the electric field and the dipoles constituting the lossy materials , we expect that the predicted photon - number oscillations can also be measured .",
    "a good candidate for such a measurement would be a setup consisting of a high - quality - factor cavity where the magnitude of oscillations as well as the incoming radiation on the left and right can be better controlled than in the single interface case .",
    "photon - number measurements have already been performed in cavities @xcite , but not in nonequilibrium conditions which is necessary for the oscillations of the effective photon number with respect to the position . if the cavity is asymmetric , the photon - number oscillations are more easily observable than in a symmetric cavity where the photon - number oscillations can disappear at resonant frequencies .",
    "if one had a thermometer that resonantly couples to one of the cavity resonances and is anisotropic so that it is capable of detecting only the single perpendicular mode studied in this work , then the predicted photon - number oscillations could be easily detected experimentally . in reality",
    "the measurement configuration is naturally more complex as controlling the directivity of a nanoscale thermometer may not be that straightforward , but similar effects are nevertheless also expected to be observable in fully three - dimensional configurations . as the taken approach is very general ,",
    "generalizing the model to three dimensions is expected to be straightforward . in this paper",
    "we have investigated only thermal source fields in detail , but the introduced operators are expected to enable also a much more general description of the quantized fields obeying other kinds of quantum statistics .",
    "for example , replacing the noise operators with operators describing partly saturated emitters @xcite could result in a simple but realistic quantum description of the generation of laser fields , and furthermore , the use of nonlinear source field operators @xcite could even allow modeling single photon sources and detectors .",
    "we have defined and studied position - dependent ladder operators for the electromagnetic field in a way that is consistent with the canonical commutation relations and also enables a physically meaningful definition of an effective position - dependent photon - number operator that has a very attractive and simple connection to the electric field , the temperature , and thermal balance of the system .",
    "the introduced operators predict oscillations in the expectation value of the effective photon number even in simple one - dimensional layered geometries .",
    "since the effective photon number is expected to be directly related to experimentally observable local temperatures in measurements in which the field - matter interaction is dominated by the coupling to the electric field , this suggests that the oscillations could be experimentally observable by measuring similar oscillations in the temperature .",
    "this essentially differentiates our definition of the effective photon number from the conventional position - independent definitions that do not take the physical properties of the electric field similarly into account .    the introduced ladder and photon - number operators provide an additional means to quantify the electric field and give further insight into the local photon - number balance associated with the electric field and the formation of the local thermal equilibrium .",
    "the additional insight provided by the approach also allows improved understanding of the challenges and physical implications of separating the photon annihilation operator into parts emitted by the left and right source domains or left and right propagating parts as done in many seminal quantization schemes .",
    "if the requirement of canonical commutation relations and ease of physical interpretation are not relaxed , the separation is not generally possible .",
    "this is in agreement with the anomalies found in the commutation relations of the photon annihilation operator .",
    "however , possibly the greatest opportunities enabled by the new formulation and the consistent definitions of the ladder and photon - number operators are in extending the description to quantum systems that are not limited to thermal fields .",
    "this could , e.g. , enable a more versatile description of the noise and measurement backaction in complex and realistic quantum systems .",
