    "infinite matroid theory has recently seen a surge of activity ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , after bruhn et al @xcite found axiomatizations of infinite matroids with duality , solving a long - standing problem of rado @xcite . as part of this re - launch of the subject",
    ", we initiated an investigation of infinite gammoids in @xcite .",
    "a _ dimaze _ is a digraph equipped with a specific set of sinks , the ( set of ) _",
    "exits_. a dimaze _ contains _ another dimaze , if , in addition to digraph containment , the exits of the former include those of the latter . in the context of digraphs",
    ", any path or ray ( i.e.  one - way infinite path ) is forward oriented .",
    "a _ linking fan _ is a dimaze obtained from the union of infinitely many disjoint non - trivial paths by identifying their first vertices and declaring their last vertices as the exits .",
    "outgoing comb _ is a dimaze obtained from a ray , called the _ spine _ , by adding infinitely many non - trivial disjoint paths , that meet the ray precisely at their initial vertices , and declaring the sinks of the resulting digraph to be the exits .",
    "a _ strict gammoid _ is a matroid isomorphic to the one defined on the vertex set of ( the digraph of ) a dimaze , whose independent sets are those subsets that are linkable to the exits by a set of disjoint paths ( @xcite ) .",
    "any dimaze defining a given strict gammoid is a _ presentation _ of that strict gammoid .",
    "gammoid _ is a matroid restriction of a strict gammoid ; so , by definition , the class of gammoids is closed under matroid deletion .",
    "a pleasant property of the class of finite gammoids is that it is also closed under matroid contractions , and hence , under taking minors .",
    "in contrast , whether the class of all gammoids , possibly infinite , is minor - closed is an open question .",
    "our aim in the first part of this paper is to begin to address this and related questions .    a standard proof of the fact that the finite gammoids are minor - closed as a class of matroids proceeds via duality .",
    "the proof of this fact can be extended to infinite dimazes whose underlying ( undirected ) graph does not contain any ray , but it breaks down when rays are allowed . however , by developing an infinite version of a construction in @xcite , we are able to prove the following ( ) .",
    "[ thm : outgoingcombfree ] the class of gammoids that admit a presentation not containing any outgoing comb is minor - closed .",

    "any finite - rank minor of an infinite gammoid is a gammoid .",

    "a matroid is a topological gammoid if and only if it is a finitary gammoid .",
    "moreover , the class of topological gammoids is minor - closed .    in the second part of the paper",
    ", we turn to duality . recall that a _ transversal matroid _ can be defined by taking a fixed vertex class of a bipartite graph as the ground set and its matchable subsets as the independent sets .",
    "ingleton and piff @xcite proved constructively that finite strict gammoids and finite transversal matroids are dual to each other , a key fact to the result that the class of finite gammoids is closed under duality .",
    "in contrast , an infinite strict gammoid",
    "need not be dual to a transversal matroid , and vice versa ( examples [ thm : arnotcotransversal ] and [ thm : transversalnotdsg ] ) . despite these examples ,",
    "it might still be possible that the class of infinite gammoids is closed under duality .",
    "however , we will see in that there is a gammoid , which is not dual to any gammoid .",
    "in @xcite , we introduced infinite strict gammoids that can be defined by dimazes that do not contain a type of dimaze , called an _ alternating comb _ ( see ) .",
    "the class formed by these gammoids is rich in the sense that it contains , for example , highly connected gammoids which are neither nearly finitary nor dual to such matroids ( see @xcite for the definitions and the examples ) .",
    "we remark that constructing a gammoid outside of this class is non - trivial @xcite .",
    "there , it was also proved that , for a dimaze , containing an alternating comb is the unique obstruction to a characterization of maximally linkable sets ; in a finite dimaze , a set is maximally linkable if and only if it is linkable onto the exits .",
    "in , we aim to describe the dual of the strict gammoids that admit a presentation not containing any alternating comb .",
    "it turns out that there exists a strict gammoid in this class that is not dual to any transversal matroid . for this reason ,",
    "we first extend transversal matroids to _ path - transversal matroids .",
