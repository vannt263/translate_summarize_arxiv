    "our current view of galaxy formation at the smallest scales is limited to observations of satellites orbiting the host halo of the milky way ( mw ) or m31 . despite the many successes of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm on large scales , several discrepancies are uncomfortably apparent on the smallest scales .",
    "perhaps most striking is the dearth of low - mass dwarf galaxies in the local group , often termed the `` missing satellites problem '' .",
    "simulations predict a wealth of substructure around mw / m31-mass galaxies , although only @xmath4 bright ( @xmath5 ) satellites orbit the mw .",
    "recent discoveries have boosted the numbers at the faint end ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "further tension with the cdm model becomes apparent in the internal structure of dwarf galaxies .",
    "observed dwarfs have shallower inner dark matter density profiles than predicted , called the `` core - cusp problem '' @xcite , and @xmath6-body simulations predict more dense dark matter subhalos than observed , called the `` too big to fail problem '' @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the dwarf galaxies in the local group allows for detailed scrutiny , but it also means that they can be influenced by the environment of the host galaxies / halos .",
    "various properties of dwarf galaxies , such as gas content ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , star formation history ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are strongly correlated with the proximity to a large galaxy .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "seemingly isolated dwarf galaxies could be affected by an encounter with another ( dwarf ) galaxy , but the importance of this is poorly known at these low masses .",
    "dwarf galaxies in the local group also are excellent laboratories to study star formation history and chemical evolution on the smallest scales .",
    "the chemical evolution models used to analyze both spectroscopic and photometric data span a wide range in sophistication and detail ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , carina ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and and ii @xcite have led to the suggestion that external factors , such as dwarf - dwarf encounters , should be considered more seriously .    at present , it remains unclear both how frequent such dwarf - dwarf interactions are in the local group , and how important these events are in the evolutionary history of low - mass galaxies .",
    "the possibility of dwarf - dwarf major mergers generally is ignored , but in this work we aim to address the validity of this assumption , using a suite of cosmological zoom - in dissipationless simulations to characterize the incidence of dwarf - dwarf galaxy mergers in the local group .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly describes the elvis suite of simulations and defines major mergers in the context of this work .",
    "section 3 outlines our results , and in section 4 we discuss the implications for dwarf galaxies in the local group .",
    "finally , section 5 summarizes our main results .",
    "to study galaxy - galaxy mergers , we use elvis ( exploring the local volume in simulations ) , a suite of zoom - in @xmath6-body simulations that model the local group in a fully cosmological context @xcite .",
    "elvis simulates 48 dark matter halos of mass similar to the mw or m31 ( @xmath7 ) within a zoom - in volume of radius @xmath8 of each halo ( corresponding to @xmath9 mpc ) at @xmath10 .",
    "half of these zoom - in regions contain a pair of halos that resemble the masses , distance , and relative velocity of the mw - m31 pair , while the other half are single isolated mass - matched halos . in this work ,",
    "we use both catalogs together and do not distinguish between isolated and paired halos ( see $ [ sec : merge_fracs ] ) .",
    "elvis was run using gadget-3 and gadget-2 @xcite with initial conditions generated using music @xcite , with @xmath11cdm cosmology with parameters based on _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "wmap7 @xcite : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the zoom - in regions were chosen from a suite of larger simulations each with cubic volume of side length 70.4 mpc . within the zoom - in regions ,",
    "the particle mass is @xmath17 and the plummer - equivalent force softening is 140 pc ( comoving at @xmath18 , physical at @xmath19 ) .",
    "three of the isolated halos were run at higher resolution with particle mass @xmath20 and force softening of 70 pc , and we use these simulations to check that resolution effects do not significantly affect our results . see @xcite for more details on elvis .",
    "elvis identifies dark matter ( sub)halos with the six - dimensional halo finder rockstar @xcite and constructs merger trees using the consistent - trees algorithm @xcite . for each isolated ( host ) halo that is not a subhalo ( within the virial radius of a more massive host halo ) ,",
    "we assign a virial mass , @xmath21 , and radius , @xmath22 , using the evolution of the virial relation from @xcite for our @xmath11cdm cosmology . at @xmath10 ,",
    "this corresponds to an overdensity of @xmath23 the critical ( matter ) density of the universe .",
    "we assign the primary progenitor ( main branch ) at each snapshot based on the total mass up to and including that snapshot , that is , the main branch contains the most total mass summed from the ( sub)halo masses over all preceding snapshots in that branch . for each ( sub)halo , we compute the maximum ( peak ) mass ever reached by the main branch of a progenitor , @xmath24 .",
    "as explored in @xcite , the ( sub)halo catalogs are complete even below the mass limits that we explore in this work ( @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath26 , see below ) .      to define mergers , at each snapshot of the simulation we follow back all progenitors of each ( sub)halo .",
    "for each progenitor that is not the primary progenitor ( main branch ) , we calculate its @xmath24 .",
    "we then identify the non - primary progenitor that has the highest peak mass , @xmath27 , and we define the merger mass ratio as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the peak mass of the primary progenitor _ before _ the snapshot under consideration .",
    "thus , the merger time is when the ( sub)halos coalesce fully in phase space such that the finder no longer can distinguish between them .",
    "we assume that this timescale is a good proxy for the onset of the _ galaxy _ merger , as any interaction between the baryonic components of the dwarfs occurs after the majority of the dark matter has been stripped ( @xcite ) .",
    "we define mergers with @xmath30 as major mergers , as we justify below .",
    "while elvis includes only dark matter , our goal is to match dark matter ( sub)halos to luminous galaxies .",
    "the relation between stellar mass and ( sub)halo dark mass ( or circular velocity ) for dwarf galaxies is highly uncertain , likely with significant scatter .",
    "nonetheless , we use the relation derived by @xcite based on elvis and observations of dwarf galaxies in the local group .",
    "they used a modified version of the relation from @xcite , based on the observed stellar mass function of @xcite , which better reproduces dwarf galaxies ( @xmath31 ) in the local group ( figure 10 in * ? ? ? * ) . at these mass scales : @xmath32 .    in defining the stellar mass ratios for major mergers in the histories of dwarf galaxies , we assume that the _ slope _ ( but not necessarily normalization ) of this relation does not evolve , motivated by the lack of strong evolution measured for slightly more massive galaxies @xcite , in addition to the lack of observational evidence to suggest otherwise .    we define major mergers as those for which the stellar mass ratios are closer than 0.1 .",
    "this broadly corresponds to mass ratios at which the lower mass companion is likely to have significant dynamical effect on the more massive galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and where recent mergers are likely to be observable . given the relation between stellar and halo mass , this corresponds to @xmath24 ratios @xmath33 , as given above .",
    "we note that our adopted threshold for major mergers is dependent on the @xmath34 relation , and , as stated above , this is highly uncertain in this low - mass regime .",
    "for example , if we instead adopt a power - law relation with a slope steeper / shallower by @xmath35dex , then our fiducial @xmath24 ratio criteria for major mergers ( @xmath36 corresponds to stellar mass ratios of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "thus , steeper @xmath34 relations lead to the inclusion of less significant stellar mass mergers in our analysis , and shallower slopes restrict our criteria to more significant stellar mass mergers",
    ". however , it is worth noting that the definition of a `` significant '' merger event itself is not well defined . in the present analysis",
    ", we argue that we are using the @xmath34 relation that most closely matches the observations in this low - mass regime , so a stellar mass ratio of @xmath39 is a good estimate for the major merger criteria that we have adopted .",
    "low - mass galaxies likely have significant stochasticity in their stellar - halo mass relation , though the level of scatter is poorly constrained .",
    "thus , we also explore the effects of including 0.3 dex log - normal scatter in @xmath40 at fixed @xmath24 , assuming that this scatter does not correlate between merging galaxies , by applying a 0.42 dex ( @xmath41 ) log - normal scatter in the mass _ ratio _ for mergers , and estimating the median major merger fractions from 100 trials ( see section 3 ) .",
    "note that during this exercise we include events with small @xmath24 ratio , @xmath30 , but stellar mass ratio @xmath42 .",
    "this takes into account the possibility of `` dark '' mergers ( see below ) , but we note that the inclusion / exclusion of these events only makes a small difference to the quoted fractions . including such random scatter boosts the major merger fractions , because it includes mergers between ( sub)halos with even more discrepant @xmath24 ratios , which are much more common ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the power - law relation between stellar - halo mass that we use , including scatter boosts the normalization of merger fractions essentially independent of mass ( see table  [ tab : fractions ] ) , but beyond that , the general trends in this paper are unaffected .",
    "we also note the possibility that some of the lowest - mass galaxies may be `` dark '' , such that they currently do not contain any ( observable ) baryons . while these cases would not represent galaxy mergers in a normal sense , a `` dark '' merger still can have a significant impact on a luminous galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so these cases remain relevant as merger events .",
    "finally , we caution that our analysis of dwarf - dwarf mergers is based on dissipationless simulations .",
    "the lifetime of subhalos can differ in hydrodynamic simulations , although it is not entirely clear how this will affect subhalo survivability ( i.e. more or less survivors ) . for example , @xcite argue for an increased survivability of `` orphan '' galaxies ( galaxies without dark matter halos ) based on semi - analytic models , whereas @xcite find that subhalos are more efficiently destroyed in hydrodynamic simulations ( that include a baryonic disk component ) relative to dark matter only simulations .",
    "the required resolution to investigate major mergers at these low mass scales with sufficient statistics is challenging for current state - of - the - art hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "thus , while an investigation with hydrodynamic simulations ( at similar resolution ) would be favorable , the current analysis offers a useful , and much needed , first step .",
    "cumulative fraction of dwarf galaxies that underwent a major merger as a function of time since last major merger , @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 , top axis ) .",
    "major mergers are those with @xmath45 , corresponding to @xmath30 .",
    "different colors show different stellar mass bins , while solid / dotted curves show dwarf galaxies that are inside / outside of the host virial radius , @xmath46 , at @xmath10 .",
    "major mergers are more common amongst more massive dwarf galaxies and those beyond @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 of all surviving dwarf galaxies ever experienced a major merger , depending on mass , and @xmath48 of all satellites with @xmath49 experienced a major merger since @xmath2.,width=321,height=257 ]      fig .",
    "[ fig : tmm ] shows the cumulative fraction of dwarf galaxies that experienced a dwarf - dwarf major merger as a function of time since the last major merger , @xmath43 , or similarly the redshift , @xmath44 .",

    "table  [ tab : fractions ] summarizes the relevant merger fractions for different bins of mass and redshift .",
    "dwarf - dwarf mergers were more common at earlier times , and the majority of major mergers occurred prior to @xmath2 , in agreement with previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the frequency of major mergers depends on galaxy mass . for satellites of higher mass ( @xmath50 , corresponding to fornax , leo i , or sculptor in the mw ; and i , and",
    "ii , or and vii in m31 ) , 10% experienced a major merger since @xmath2 . at lower masses ( @xmath51 , corresponding to sextans or draco ) these fractions drop to @xmath52 , down to @xmath53 at @xmath54 , the mass regime of the ultra - faints .",
    "thus , particularly for the most massive satellites of mw and m31 , recent major mergers ( @xmath55 ) are not particularly rare . while the redshift baseline of @xmath56 is somewhat arbitrary , it is motivated by most dwarf galaxies having built the majority of their stellar mass by @xmath57 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "almost all satellite dwarf galaxies inside @xmath46 of the mw / m31 are gas - poor and quenched , likely because of strong tidal / ram - pressure stripping by the host halo . therefore , satellite - satellite mergers after infall are more likely to be gas - poor dissipationless mergers .",
    "the effects on a galaxy from a gas - rich versus gas - poor merger is likely quite different , though a quantitative understanding for the local group remains difficult , given that the timescales for gas stripping after virial infall , the effects of group pre - processing , and the influence of the host halo at several @xmath46 remain poorly known .",
    "satellite - satellite mergers may in fact remain gas - rich if the short time delay between virial infall and merging ( @xmath99 gyr ) is shorter than the environmental quenching timescale after virial infall , which can be long ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , at least for more massive satellites .",
    "on the other hand , the near - unity quenched fraction of satellites of the mw and m31 suggests much faster quenching for dwarf satellites .",
    "while it is beyond the scope of this work ( based on simulations with only dark matter ) to quantify the gas content of mergers , it would be an interesting extension to examine gas - rich versus gas - poor dwarf - dwarf mergers in hydrodynamical simulations .      throughout , we labeled `` recent '' mergers as those that occurred after @xmath2 .",
    "this redshift does have some physical significance in the evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that most dwarf galaxies formed the bulk ( @xmath100 ) of their stellar mass by @xmath2 .",
    "however , we acknowledge that the exact choice is somewhat arbitrary , because it remains unclear how long major mergers would have significant remaining impact on star formation , stellar kinematics , or morphology , and indeed it may be different for each of these quantities . furthermore , the survival of merger signatures in phase - space depends strongly on the gravitational potential as well as the merger orbit .",
    "we plan to investigate more observationally motivated timescales for dwarf - dwarf mergers in future work .",
    "one area in which all major mergers , regardless of redshift , are relevant is archaeologically derived histories of star formation and metallicity for dwarf galaxies from resolved stellar populations @xcite .",
    "any boosts in star formation may well be the by - product of gas - rich mergers , or similarly , mergers between galaxies of discrepant stellar mass could lead to significant scatter in the internal metallicity distribution .",
    "our results suggest that such observational signatures are most likely in the history at earlier times , when mergers were most likely , and for dwarf galaxies at larger distances from the center of the mw / m31 .",
    "major mergers may have important implications for massive black holes at the centers of dwarf galaxies . in recent years",
    ", several authors have pursued a concerted effort to study massive black holes in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , motivated in part because these mass scales are likely the most closely linked to primordial seeds of massive black holes in low - mass galaxies . however , our results suggest that major merger activity is non - negligible on dwarf mass scales .",
    "such galaxy major mergers may lead to the merging of the constituent massive black holes , and gas - rich mergers ( which are likely for dwarf galaxies ) could trigger rapid gas accretion into the black hole , both of which would enhance the growth of the central black hole beyond the primordial seed .",
    "thus , dwarf - dwarf mergers may play an important role in our ability to distinguish between formation scenarios of massive black hole seeds using local dwarf galaxies .",
    "furthermore , a merger between dwarf galaxies that both contain a massive black hole can lead to a black hole merger with a gravitational - wave recoil @xcite . while the recoil velocity depends on the mass ratio and relative spin of the black holes ,",
    "the lower escape velocity of dwarf galaxies ( relative to more massive galaxies ) means that recoiling black holes more easily can escape from the galaxy .",
    "thus , black hole ejection may be an important consequence of mergers between dwarf galaxies .",
    "in particular , if all dwarf galaxies host massive black holes , then those dwarfs that experienced a major merger may no longer retain a black hole .",
    "thus , in order to quantify the occupation distribution of black holes in nearby dwarf galaxies , one should consider the major merger fractions that we present here .",
    "dwarf galaxies in the local group are excellent laboratories to study dark matter , gas dynamics , star formation , and chemical evolution on the smallest cosmological scales . such properties of dwarf galaxies are affected by external environmental processes , and dwarf - dwarf galaxy mergers are one such process that can have a strong influence .",
    "we investigated the incidence of dwarf - dwarf galaxy mergers in the local group using the elvis suite of cosmological zoom - in dissipationless simulations .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .    1 .   recent dwarf - dwarf galaxy major mergers are not uncommon . at @xmath1 , 10% of satellite dwarf galaxies within the virial radius of a mw or m31-like host halo",
    "experienced a major merger since @xmath2 .",
    "the incidence of mergers becomes less frequent for lower mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "2 .   for satellites inside of the host virial radius today",
    ", most mergers occurred _ before _ virial infall .",
    "the satellite - satellite mergers that occurred after infall typically happened shortly ( @xmath77 gyr ) after crossing within the host virial radius and were between galaxies that fell into the host halo as a pair in a group ( see wetzel , deason , garrison - kimmel 2014 , in prep .",
    "for more details ) .",
    "satellite merger remnants are biased towards larger radial distances within the host halo , because most mergers occurred prior to falling into the host halo , and thus merger remnants have more recent virial infall times .",
    "dwarf galaxies that are beyond the host virial radius are about twice as likely to have experienced a recent merger .",
    "specifically , @xmath101 of dwarf galaxies with @xmath66 at @xmath102 kpc experienced a major merger since @xmath2 .",
    "such dwarf merger remnants also are more likely at larger distances from the host halo .",
    "thus , for dwarf galaxies at large distances , where interactions with a large halo such as mw or m31 are less likely , dwarf - dwarf mergers are _ more _ likely .",
