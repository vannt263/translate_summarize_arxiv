    "ulysses _ , _ wind _ and _ near _ spacecraft on december 8 , 1999 , at 04:36:52 ut . the gamma - ray properties , the localization and the subsequent discovery of the radio counterpart to grb991208 are presented by hurley _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) .",
    "the ipn can typically localize events within one or two days .",
    "therefore , important spectral transitions , such as the passage of the synchrotron peak and cooling frequencies ( @xcite ) , that occur at optical and infrared wavelengths a few hours after the event are missed by optical and infrared follow - up observations on ipn bursts .",
    "fortunately , the radio range allows similar studies on time scales from days to weeks .    here",
    "we present an extensive set of radio observations monitoring grb991208 between 1.4 and 250 ghz during the first two weeks after the event .",
    "it is the second brightest afterglow detected at millimeter wavelengths to date ( @xcite ) .",
    "the brightness of the afterglow allows us to trace the evolution of the characteristic synchrotron peak frequency , the self - absorption frequency , and the peak flux density .",
    "the observations and results are presented in  [ sec : results ] , and compared with appropriate models in  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "observations were made from 1.43 to 250 ghz , at a number of facilities : the max - planck millimeter bolometer ( mambo ; @xcite ) at the iram 30-m telescope on pico veleta ( spain ; @xcite ) , the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) in the french alps ( @xcite ) , the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter - wave array , the ovro 40-meter telescope , the ryle telescope at cambridge ( uk ) , and the nrao very large array ( vla ) .",
    "we have detailed our observing and calibration strategy in kulkarni _",
    "( 1999 ) , galama _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) , frail _ et al . _",
    "( 2000 ) , and berger _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) .",
    "a log of the observations is provided in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the millimeter emission from  is one of the brightest ever detected ( @xcite ) enabling us to obtain a unique data set . rather than single - epoch snapshot spectra ( @xcite ) , we have well - sampled spectra and light curves over more than two decades in frequency for a two - week period .",
    "grb991208 is therefore well - suited to a study of the broad - band evolution of the radio afterglow in the first two weeks after the burst .",
    "we display light curves for a subset of these data in fig .",
    "[ fig : obs ] . the data from table [ tab : obs ] at 22 ghz ,",
    "30 ghz and 86 ghz are too sparse to plot in this form .",
    "several trends are apparent . at the highest frequencies ( 250 ghz , 100 ghz and 15 ghz ) the flux densities are either declining or constant during the first week , but thereafter fade below detectability . at frequencies below 10 ghz",
    "we see erratic flux density variations due to interstellar scintillation ( iss ; see e.g. @xcite ; details on the iss properties of grb991208 can be found in galama _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) . therefore",
    ", below 10 ghz it is harder to discern a pattern .",
    "the overall trend in fig .",
    "[ fig : obs ] is for the peak flux density to decline with decreasing frequency , while the time - to - maximum increases .",
    "an alternate way to view the data in table [ tab : obs ] is to construct instantaneous spectral flux distributions at several epochs , which were chosen to obtain a maximum number of observations sufficiently close in time .",
    "all values were brought to the same epoch by applying a correction that was determined by fitting cubic splines to each of the light curves in fig . [",
    "fig : obs ] . we have added in quadrature an additional error of 25  % of the synchrotron spectral model flux ( see  [ sec : specfits ] ) to the fluxes below 10 ghz to reflect the uncertainty due to iss ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting spectral flux distributions are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "the spectra for all four epochs show the same overall morphology - flat from 10 ghz to 250 ghz , and dropping precipitously below 10 ghz .",
    "in addition , we reconstruct the radio to optical spectral flux distribution at the epoch of december 15.5 ut by including k , r and i - band detections ( @xcite ) . all values were brought to the same epoch by applying a correction using the slope of the fitted optical light curve ( @xcite ) .",
    "we corrected for galactic foreground reddening ( a@xmath7 , a@xmath8 , and a@xmath9 ; as inferred from the dust maps of schlegel , finkbeiner and davis 1998 ) . the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiotoopt ] .",
    "the cm / mm / optical to x - ray afterglow emission is believed to arise from the forward shock of a relativistic blast wave that propagates into the circumburst medium ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the synchrotron afterglow spectrum has four distinct regions : @xmath10 below the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) ; @xmath12 up to the synchrotron peak at @xmath1 ( @xmath13 ) ; @xmath14 above the peak up to the cooling frequency @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) ; and @xmath17 above cooling ( @xmath18 ; see e.g. @xcite ; we have assumed slow cooling , i.e. @xmath19 ) . here",
    ", @xmath20 is the power - law index of the electron energy distribution .    the spectral flux distribution of dec 15.5 ut ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radiotoopt ] ) peaks at @xmath21 40 ghz .",
    "a fit to the radio data is provided by a synchrotron spectrum from a relativistic blast wave as specified by granot , piran and sari  ( 1999a ; see their fig .",
    "10 for the equipartition field model ) .",
    "we scale their dimensionless functional form by peak frequency @xmath1 and peak flux density @xmath22 to derive a function @xmath23 with asymptotic behavior of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we account for synchrotron self - absorption at @xmath0 by multiplying @xmath23 by @xmath28/\\tau$ ] , where @xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "first we fit the radio to optical spectral flux distribution of december 15.5 ut and find : @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath32 ghz , @xmath33 ghz , and f@xmath34 mjy ( @xmath35 ; 6 degrees of freedom ; d.o.f . ) .",
    "the spectrum is well described by synchrotron emission from a power - law electron distribution with index @xmath36 , self - absorbed at low frequencies ; the fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiotoopt ] .    next",
    ", we fix @xmath36 and fit all the epochs of the radio spectral flux distributions ( the fits are shown in fig . [ fig : spec ] ) : the derived values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath22 and their uncertainties are given in table [ tab : fits ] .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , where a clear temporal evolution of @xmath1 and @xmath22 is apparent .",
    "we note that assuming @xmath37 ( see  [ sec : dis ] ) does not change the results of the fits ( i.e. , when no optical data is included the fits are rather insensitive to the assumed value of @xmath20 ) . to characterize this evolution , we made power - law least squares fits to the data .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : fitsres ] .",
    "the brightness of the radio counterpart to grb991208 has allowed for the first time to trace the evolution of the characteristic synchrotron parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and f@xmath2 .",
    "we may now compare this result directly with expectations from relativistic blast wave models .",
    "currently popular scenarios for the origin of grbs are : a compact object merger ( the neutron star - neutron star , @xcite , and neutron star - black hole merger models , @xcite ) , and the core collapse of a very massive star ( ` failed ' supernova or hypernova @xcite ) . in principle",
    "afterglow observations can distinguish a compact object merger , which is expected to occur in a constant density interstellar medium ( constant density ism model ; see @xcite and @xcite for details ) , from a hypernova , where the circumburst environment will have been influenced by the strong wind of the massive progenitor star ( wind model ; see @xcite ) .",
    "below we compare each of the afterglow models separately with the observations .",
    "the expected scalings ( we assume adiabatic expansion of the remnant ) for each of the models , including the case where the outflow is collimated in a jet , are also provided in table [ tab : fitsres ] for comparison with the evolution derived from the spectral fits .",
    "the observed decay of the peak - flux density f@xmath2 is inconsistent with the constant density ism model ( see table [ tab : fitsres ] ) , which predicts a constant peak flux .",
    "also , the optical afterglow of grb991208 ( r band ) displays a rapid decay : @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "a constant density ism model would require @xmath40 in order to account for the rapid decay observed at optical wavelengths . for @xmath41 the synchrotron spectrum above the peak should be much steeper than observed ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we note that optical extinction local to the host would cause the observed spectrum to be even shallower .",
    "the constant density ism model can thus be ruled out on the basis of the spectral flux distribution on 1999 dec .",
    "15.5 ut , which shows a flat spectrum corresponding to @xmath36 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : radiotoopt ] ) .    comparing grb991208 with the wind model ( see table [ tab : fitsres ] ) we find that the evolution of the peak - flux density f@xmath2 and the peak frequency @xmath1 are as expected , but we find no evidence for a decrease with time of the self - absorption frequency @xmath0 . and , similar to the case of the constant density ism model , a wind model would require @xmath43 in order to account for the rapid decay observed at optical wavelengths .",
    "we therefore also reject the wind model .",
    "finally , the outflow may be collimated into jets ( jet model ; see for details @xcite ) .",
    "once sideways expansion of the jet dominates the dynamics of the relativistic - blast wave , a jet plus constant ambient density medium ( ism + jet ) or a jet plus wind stratified ambient medium ( wind + jet ) will have very similar properties . in this stage",
    ", the morphology of the ambient medium will be difficult to constrain .",
    "the observed evolution of @xmath0 , and @xmath1 are as expected in the jet model , but the drop in peak - flux density f@xmath44 is not as rapid as predicted ( see table [ tab : fitsres ] ) . to obtain the predicted decay rate f@xmath45 we have to raise @xmath46 by 21.0 ( corresponding to @xmath47 ) ; the observed decay is thus significantly different from the predicted decay . and ,",
    "in the case of a jet , at late times , when the evolution is dominated by the spreading of the jet , the model predicts @xmath48 , and the r - band measurement thus corresponds to @xmath49 . for @xmath37 the synchrotron spectrum above the peak should be shallower than observed .",
    "but , we find that @xmath36 gives a satisfactory description of the dec 15.5 ut data ( fig . [",
    "fig : radiotoopt ] ) .",
    "for example assuming @xmath50 provides a worse fit ( @xmath51 = 3.4 as opposed to 1.6 for @xmath36 ; dec . 15.5 ut radio to optical spectral flux distribution ; fig .",
    "[ fig : radiotoopt ] ) .    a @xmath50 jet model could only be saved if one assumes a cooling break between the mm and optical passbands , around @xmath52 hz ( the optical decay would still satisfy @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath49 ) .",
    "however , in that case the optical / infrared synchrotron spectrum f@xmath54 , i.e. significantly steeper than observed ( @xmath55 , f@xmath56 ; @xcite ) . we therefore reject the possibility that @xmath50 .    in the jet model , the shallow decay of the peak - flux density f@xmath44 and the apparent discrepancy in the value of @xmath20 derived from the spectrum and from the light curve ,",
    "can be understood if during the first two weeks the grb remnant was still undergoing the transition from a quasi - spherical ( either constant density ism or a wind ) , i.e. f@xmath57 ( constant density ism ) , or f@xmath58 ( wind ) to a jet evolution , f@xmath59 . as discussed by kumar and panaitescu ( 2000 )",
    "this transition takes place over at least an order of magnitude , but more likely several orders of magnitudes , in observer time .",
    "since typically we expect the jet transition to take place around one to several days ( @xcite ) it is natural to expect that the transition was still ongoing ; the evolution of the synchrotron parameters will then be somewhere between fully spherical at early times ( either constant density ism or a wind ) and fully dominated by a jet later .",
    "this is consistent with the data , would explain the shallow decay of the peak flux density , and would also explain why the optical decay rate exponent @xmath60 ( @xcite ) is not as steep as for a fully developed jet transition @xmath61 .",
    "determination of @xmath20 from light curves requires observations after the transition has been completed and from the optical data we can not establish whether this is the case .",
    "also the light curve is not necessarily expected to approach the asymptotic limit @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath20 derived from the optical light curve is thus rather uncertain and the value of @xmath62 that we have inferred from the spectral flux distribution is the more robust number , since @xmath20 so derived is independent of the hydrodynamical evolution of the blastwave .    a similarly slowly developing jet transition was observed for grb990123 ( @xcite ) , where after the jet break ( at @xmath63 days ) the optical decay rate exponent @xmath64 ; whereas a steep @xmath65 would have been expected for a fully developed jet transition .",
    "also for grb991216 a slow transition is seen , but due to host contamination , the late - time decay rate exponent can only be constrained to lie between @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( @xcite ) . on the other hand grb990510 and grb000301c",
    "appear to be examples of relatively fast and fully developed jet transitions ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the jet model can account for the observed evolution of the synchrotron parameters of grb991208 , the rapid decay at optical wavelengths and for the observed radio to optical spectral flux distributions , provided that the jet transition has not been fully completed in the first two weeks after the event .",
    "these observations provide additional evidence that rapidly decaying afterglows are due to jets ( @xcite ) and that at least in some afterglows these transitions are not fully developed .",
    "around 10 days after the event @xmath1 passed @xmath0 ( @xmath68 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) at @xmath69 8 ghz ; from then on @xmath0 is expected to evolve differently : @xmath70 ( for @xmath71 ) ; we have assumed a jet - model evolution .",
    "also after @xmath72 has passed 8.46 ( @xmath69 12 days ) and 4.86 ghz ( @xmath69 17 days ) , the flux densities at these frequencies should decay rapidly f@xmath73 . continued monitoring with the vla ( @xcite ) will allow tests of these expectations .",
