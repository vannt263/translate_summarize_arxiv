    "continuous - variable quantum key distribution ( cvqkd ) encodes information into the quadratures of optical fields and extracts it with homodyne detection , which has higher efficiency and repetition rate than that of the single photon detector @xcite .",
    "cvqkd , especially the gg02 protocol @xcite , is hopeful to realize high speed key generation between two parties , alice and bob .    besides experimental demonstrations @xcite , the theoretical security of cvqkd has been established against collective attacks @xcite , which has been shown optimal in the asymptotical limit @xcite .",
    "the practical security of cvqkd has also been noticed in the recent years , and it has been shown that the source noise in state preparation may be undermine the secure key rate @xcite . in gg02 , the coherent states should be displaced in phase space following gaussian modulation with variance @xmath0 . however , due to the imperfections in laser source and modulators , the actual variance is changed to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the variance of source noise .",
    "an method to describe the trusted source noise is the beamsplitter model @xcite .",
    "this model has a good approximation for source noise , especially when the transmittance of beamsplitter @xmath3 approaches @xmath4 , which means that the loss in signal mode is negligible .",
    "however , this method has the difficulty of parameter estimation to the ancilla mode of the beamsplitter , without the information of which , the covariance matrix of the system are not able to determine . in this case",
    ", the optimality of gaussian attack @xcite should be reconsidered @xcite , and we have to assume that the channel is linear to calculate the secure key rate . to solve this problem , we proposed an improved source noise model with general unitary transformation @xcite . without extra assumption on quantum channel and ancilla state , we are able to derive a tight security bound for reverse reconciliation , as long as the variance of source noise @xmath2 can be properly estimated .",
    "the optimality of gaussian attack is kept within this model .",
    "the remaining problem is to estimate the variance of source noise properly .",
    "without such a source monitor , alice and bob can not discriminate source noise from channel excess noise , which is supposed to be controlled by the eavesdropper ( eve ) @xcite . in practice ,",
    "source noise is trusted and is not controlled by eve .",
    "so , such _ untrusted source noise model _ just overestimates evepower and leads to an untight security bound .",
    "a compromised method is to measure the quadratures of alice s actual output states each time before starting experiment .",
    "however , this work is time consuming , and in qkd running time , the variance of source noise may fluctuate slowly and deviate from preliminary result . in this paper , we propose two real - time schemes , that the active switch scheme and the passive beamsplitter scheme to monitor the variance of source noise , with the help of which , we derive the security bounds asymptotically for both of them against collective attacks , and discuss their potential applications when finite size effect is taken into account .",
    "in this section , we introduce two real - time schemes to monitor the variance of source noise for the gg02 protocol , based on our general model .",
    "both schemes are implemented in the so - called prepare and measurement scheme ( p&m scheme ) @xcite , while for the ease of theoretical research , here we analyze their security in the entanglement - based scheme ( e - b scheme ) .",
    "the covariance matrix , used to simplify the calculation , is defined by @xcite @xmath5,\\ ] ] where operator @xmath6 , @xmath7 , mean value @xmath8 $ ] , @xmath9 is the density matrix , and @xmath10 denotes the anticommutator .    in e - b scheme",
    ", alice prepares epr pairs , measuring the quadratures of one mode with two balanced homodyne detectors , and then send the other mode to bob .",
    "it is easy to verify that the covariance matrix of an epr pair is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the variance of the epr modes , and @xmath13 corresponds to alice s modulation variance in the p&m scheme .",
    "however , due to the effect of source noise , the actual covariance matrix is changed to @xmath14 where @xmath2 is the variance of source noise .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , we assume this noise is introduced by a neutral party , fred , who purifies @xmath15 and introduces the source noise with arbitrary unitary transformation . in this section",
    ", we show how to monitor @xmath2 with our active and passive schemes , and derive the security bounds in the infinite key limit .",
    "a method of source monitoring is to use an active optical switch , controlled by a true random number generator ( trng ) , combined with a homodyne detection .",
    "the entanglement - based version @xcite of this scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pic2 ] , where we randomly select parts of signal pulses , measure their quadratures and estimate their variance . in the infinite key limit",
    ", the pulses used for source monitor should have the same statistical identities with that sent to bob . comparing the estimated value with the theoretical one , we are able to derive the variance of source noise , and the security bound",
    "can be calculated by @xcite @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the sampling ratio of source monitoring , @xmath18 is the classical mutual information between alice and bob , @xmath19 is the quantum mutual information between eve and bob , and @xmath20 is the reconciliation efficiency . after channel transmission , the whole system can be described by covariance matrix @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath2 is the variance of source noise , @xmath23 matrix @xmath24 is related to fred s two - mode state , @xmath25 is the transmittance and @xmath26 is the channel noise and @xmath27 is the channel excess noise . in practice",
    ", the covariance matrix can be estimated with experimental data with source monitor and parameter estimation . here",

    ". the asymptotic performance of this scheme will be analyzed in sec .",
    "though the active switch scheme is intuitive in theoretical research , it is very not convenient in the experimental realization , since the high speed optical switch and an extra trng are needed .",
    "also , it lowers the secure key rate with @xmath31 due to the sampling ratio .",
    "inspired by @xcite , we propose a passive beam splitter scheme to simplify the implementation . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bsscheme ] , a beamsplitter is used to separate mode @xmath32 into two parts . one mode , @xmath33 , is monitored by alice , and the other , @xmath34 , is sent to bob .",
    "is replaced by a beamsplitter .",
    "alice and bob are able to estimate the source noise by measuring mode @xmath33 with the homodyne detection .",
    ", height=144 ]    the security bound of passive beam splitter scheme can be calculated in a similar way that we substitute the whole state @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the covariance of its subsystem , @xmath37 , can be written as @xmath38 where mode @xmath39 is initially in the vacuum state .",
    "the covariance matrix after beam splitter is @xmath40 where @xmath41 then , mode @xmath34 is sent to bob through quantum channel , characterized by @xmath42 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath19 in this scheme is a little more complex , since an extra mode @xmath33 is introduced by the beamsplitter .",
    "we omit the detail of calculation here , which can be derived from @xcite .",
    "the performance of this scheme is discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section , we analyze the performance of both schemes with numerical simulation .",
    "as mentioned above , the simulation is restricted to the asymptotic limit .",
    "the case of finite size will be discussed later . to show the performance of source monitor schemes , we illustrate the secure key rate in fig .",
    "[ comparision ] , in which the _ untrusted noise scheme _ is included for comparison . for the ease of discussion , the imperfections in practical detectors are not included in our simulation , the effect of which have been studied previously @xcite .    , the source noise is @xmath43 , the channel excess noise is @xmath44 , and the reconciliation efficiency is @xmath45 .",
    "the sample ration in the optical switch scheme is @xmath46 , and the transmittance in the beam splitter scheme is @xmath47.,height=288 ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ comparision ] , secure key rate of each scheme is limited within @xmath48 , where large excess noise @xmath49 is used . under state - of - the - art technology , the excess noise can be controlled less than a few percent of the shot noise .",
    "so , our simulation is just a conservative estimation on the secure key rate .",
    "the _ untrusted source noise scheme _ has the shortest secure distance , because it ascribes the source noise into channel noise , which is supposed to be induced by the eavesdropper .",
    "in fact , source noise is neutral and can be controlled neither by alice and bob , nor by eve .",
    "so , this scheme just overestimates eve s power by supposing she can acquire extra information from source noise , which lower the secure key rate of this scheme .",
    "both the active and passive schemes have longer secure distance than the untrusted noise scheme , since they are based on the general source noise model , which does not ascribe source noise into eve s knowledge .",
    "the active switch scheme has lower secure key rate in the short distance area .",
    "this is mainly because that the random sampling process intercepts parts of the signal pulses to estimate the variance of source noise , which reduces the repetition rate with ratio @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless , it does not overestimate eve s power @xcite . as a result",
    ", the secure key distance is improved .     and transmittance @xmath50 , in which t varies from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "the colored parts illustrates the area with positive secure key rate , the empty parts illustrates to insecure area , and the abscissa values of boundary points corresponds to the secure distance.,height=336 ]    both the secure key rate and secure distance of beam splitter scheme are superior than that of other schemes , when the transmittance is set to be @xmath53 , equal to the sampling rate @xmath17 in optical switch scheme , where no extra vacuum noise is introduced .",
    "this phenomena is quite similar to the `` noise beat noise '' scheme @xcite , which improves the secure key rate by introduce an extra noise into bob s side . though such noise lowers the mutual information between alice and bob , it also makes eve more difficult to estimate bob s measurement result . with the help of simulation",
    ", we find a similar phenomenon in the beam splitter scheme , the vacuum noise reduces mutual information @xmath54 more rapidly than its effect on @xmath18 .",
    "a preliminary explanation is that the sampled pulse in optical switch scheme is just used to estimate the noise variance , while in beam splitter model it increases eve s uncertainty on bob s information .",
    "combined with advantages in experimental realization , beam splitter scheme should be a superior choice .    to optimize the performance of passive beam splitter scheme",
    ", we illustrate the secure key rate in fig .",
    "[ 3d ] for different beam splitter transmittance @xmath3 .",
    "the maximal secure distance about @xmath55 is achieved when @xmath56 , about @xmath57 km longer than that when @xmath58 .",
    "combined with the discussion above , this result can be understood as a balance between the effects of the noise on @xmath18 and @xmath54 , induced by beamsplitter .",
    "when @xmath3 is too small , @xmath18 also decreases rapidly , which limits the secure distance .",
    "the performance of source monitor schemes above is analyzed in asymptotical limit . in practice , the real - time monitor will concern the finite - size effect , since the variance of source noise may change slowly .",
    "a thorough research in finite size effect is beyond the scope of this paper , because the security of cvqkd in finite size is still under development , that the optimality of gaussian attack and collective attack has not been shown in the finite size case .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to give a rough estimation on the effect of block size , for a given distance . taking the active optical switch scheme for example , with a similar method in @xcite ,",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimator @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the measurement result of source monitor , and @xmath63 is the expected value of the variance of source noise . for large @xmath64",
    ", the @xmath65 distribution converges to a normal distribution .",
    "so , we have @xmath66 where @xmath67 is such that @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the failure probability .",
    "the reason why we choose @xmath70 is that given the values of @xmath71 and @xmath25 , estimated by bob , the minimum of @xmath2 corresponds to the maximum of channel noise @xmath72 , which may be fully controlled by eve .",
    "the extra variance @xmath73 due to the finite size effect in source monitor is @xmath74 for @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 . as analyzed in @xcite ,",
    "if the distance between alice and bob is @xmath77 km ( @xmath78 ) , the block length should be at least @xmath79 , which corresponds to @xmath80 induced by the finite size effect in source monitor .",
    "compared with the channel excess noise of @xmath81 , the effect of finite size in source monitor is very slight . due to the high repetition rate in cvqkd ,",
    "alice and bob are able to accumulate such a block within several minutes , during which the source noise may change slightly .",
    "in conclusion , we propose two schemes , the active optical switch scheme and the passive beamsplitter scheme , to monitor the variance of source noise @xmath2 . combined with previous general noise model , we derive tight security bounds for both schemes with reverse reconciliation in the asymptotic limit .",
    "both schemes can be implemented under current technology , and the simulation result shows an better performance of our schemes , compared with the untrusted source noise model .",
    "further improvement in secure distance can be achieved , when the transmittance @xmath3 is optimized .    in practise ,",
    "the source noise varies slowly . to realize real - time monitoring ,",
    "the finite size effect should be taken into account , that the block size should not be so large , that the source noise has changed significantly within this block , and the block size should not be too small , that we can not estimate the source noise accurately .",
    "the security proof of cvqkd with finite block size has not been established completely , since the optimality of collective attack and gaussian attack has not been shown in finite size .",
    "nevertheless , we derive the effective source noise induced by the finite block size , and find its effect is not significant in our scheme .",
    "so , our schemes may be helpful to realize real - time source monitor in the future .",
