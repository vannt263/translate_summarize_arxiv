    "the study of event - by - event fluctuations in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions opens new possibilities to investigate the phase transition between hadronic and partonic matter as well as the qcd critical point ( see the reviews @xcite ) . in our recent paper @xcite",
    "we have presented a systematic study of the particle number fluctuations for pions @xmath0 and kaons @xmath1 and their correlations in the statistical model ( sm ) in different ensembles and in the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) transport model  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we continue this study and consider the fluctuations of the number of protons p@xmath2 , the @xmath3-@xmath4 and @xmath5-@xmath4 correlations , and fluctuations of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 particle number ratios .",
    "the hsd results for the fluctuations in the particle number ratios are compared with na49 data for pb+pb collisions at sps energies @xcite for the proton to pion ratio as well as preliminary star data for au+au collisions at rhic energies for the proton to pion @xcite and kaon to proton @xcite ratios .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the observables for particle number fluctuations and correlations are introduced . in section",

    "the procedure of the calculations is essentially the same as in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the sm and hsd results for scaled variances of kaons @xmath1 , pions @xmath0 , and protons p@xmath2 , and the correlation coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ( defined by eq .  ( [ omega ] ) ) are presented in tables i and ii . figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath30 , respectively .",

    "the sm results for @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath34 , @xmath33 and @xmath28 are presented in table i of ref .",
    "@xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us first comment on the sm results for the particle number fluctuations and correlations in different ensembles .",
    "the global charge conservation laws suppress the particle number fluctuations in the canonical ensemble ( ce ) in a comparison with the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) .",
    "exact energy conservation in the micro canonical ensemble ( mce ) makes this suppression even stronger .",
    "this leads to the result that the mce scaled variances @xmath14 become smaller than unity .",
    "the contributions to the correlation parameter @xmath15 in the sm stem from two sources : resonance decays and global conservation laws .",
    "resonances decaying into pairs of particles of species @xmath8 and @xmath9 produce a corresponding correlation and yield a positive contribution to @xmath15 . on the other hand , the conservation laws lead to an anticorrelation and thus to negative contributions to @xmath15 .    as seen from figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] the hsd results for @xmath38 , @xmath32 and @xmath30 ( denoted by the solid lines ) are close to the ce and mce results for low sps energies .",
    "one may conclude that the influence of conservation laws is more stringent at low collision energies .",
    "the same conclusion follows from the hsd results for @xmath34 , @xmath33 and @xmath28 ( see figs .  1 and 2 in ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "the hsd values for @xmath14 and @xmath15 increase , however , at high collision energies and a sizeable deviation of the hsd results from those in the mce sm is observed with increasing energies for @xmath41  gev .",
    "we point out again that important aspects of the event - by - event fluctuations in nucleus - nucleus collisions are the dependence on the centrality selection and experimental acceptance .",
    "we accordingly discuss the role of these effects using hsd results for the scaled variance @xmath34 of the pion number fluctuations . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the scaled variance @xmath42 ( calculated within hsd ) for the full acceptance and for the experimental acceptance are shown in nucleus - nucleus collisions for zero impact parameter @xmath43 ( see the next section for details of the experimental acceptance ) .",
    "introducing the probability @xmath44 of pion experimental acceptance as the ratio of an average accepted to the total multiplicities , @xmath45 , one finds : @xmath46 equation  ( [ acc ] ) connects the scaled variance @xmath47 in the full @xmath48 space with @xmath49 defined for the experimental acceptance .",
    "the acceptance scaling ( [ acc ] ) assumes ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) an absence of particle correlations in momentum space",
    ". figure [ fig3 ] demonstrates that the acceptance scaling ( [ acc ] ) underestimates the scaled variance @xmath49 at rhic energies .",
    "the samples of collision events selected experimentally are 3.5% of most central collision events in pb+pb collisions at the sps energies and 5% in au+au collisions at rhic energies .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] presents the hsd results for @xmath42 in these samples of the most central events and their comparison with the hsd results at zero impact parameter .",
    "one finds much larger values of @xmath42 in the centrality selected samples than for @xmath43 .",
    "the effect is especially strong at rhic energies .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood within the model of independent sources : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the scaled variance for pions produced by one source , @xmath52 is the scaled variance for the fluctuations of nucleon participants , and @xmath53 is the average pion multiplicity per participating nucleon which increases monotonously with collision energy .",
    "collisions with zero impact parameter correspond to @xmath54 .",
    "thus , @xmath51 can be approximately taken as @xmath34 at @xmath43 .",
    "the hsd results correspond approximately to @xmath55 for the 3.5% most central pb+pb collisions at sps energies and @xmath56 for the 5% most central au+au collisions at rhic energies",
    ". please note that we used the restrictions on impact parameter @xmath57 in the hsd calculations to form the samples of most central events .",
    "the results of the model of independent sources ( [ mis ] ) for @xmath42 are shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and are close to the actual values of the hsd simulations for @xmath42 .",
    "a comparison of the sm results for fluctuations in different ensembles with the data looks problematic at present ; the same is true for most other theoretical models .",
    "this is because of difficulties in implementing the experimental acceptance and centrality selection which , however , can be taken into account in the transport approach . in order to compare the hsd calculations with the measured data , the experimental cuts are applied for the simulated set of hsd events . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the hsd results of @xmath58 ( [ sigmadyn ] ) for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 ratios are shown in comparison with the experimental data by the na49 collaboration at the sps  @xcite and the preliminary data of the star collaboration at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the results of the urqmd calculations for @xmath59 at the sps energies ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) are also shown by the dashed line .    for the sps energies we use the na49 acceptance tables from ref .  @xcite . for the rhic energies we use the following cuts",
    ": in pseudorapidity , @xmath60 , and in transverse momentum , @xmath61  gev / c for kaons and pions and @xmath62  gev / c for protons  @xcite .",
    "we note also , that hsd results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] correspond to the centrality selection as in the experiment : the na49 data correspond to the 3.5% most central collisions selected via veto calorimeter , whereas in the star experiment the 5% most central events with the highest multiplicities in the pseudorapidity range @xmath63 have been selected .    at the sps energies the hsd simulations lead to negative values of @xmath58 for the proton to pion ratio .",
    "this is in agreement with the na49 data in pb+pb collisions . on the other hand hsd",
    "gives large positive values of @xmath59 at rhic energies which strongly overestimate the preliminary star data for au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "for @xmath64 only preliminary star data in au+au collisions are available  @xcite which demonstrate a qualitative agreement with the hsd results ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the hsd results for @xmath64 show a weak energy dependence in both sps and rhic energy regions .",
    "a peculiar feature is , however , a strong ` jump ' between the sps and rhic values seen in the _ lower panel _ of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , in the hsd calculations which is caused by the different acceptances in the sps and rhic measurements .",
    "the influence of the experimental acceptance is clearly seen at 160 a gev where a switch from the na49 to the star acceptance leads to the jump in @xmath64 by 3% - lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . on the other hand , our calculations for pb+pb ( 3.5% central ) and for au+au ( 5% central ) collisions - performed within the na49 acceptance for both cases at 160",
    "a gev - shows a very week sensitivity of @xmath64 on the actual choice of the collision system and centrality  cf . the coincident open circle and triangle at 160 a gev in the lower panel of fig . [ fig5 ]",
    "we have studied the event - by - event fluctuations of the number of protons ( and anti - protons ) , the proton - pion and proton - kaon correlations , and the fluctuations of proton to pion and kaon to proton ratios in central pb+pb and au+au collisions from low sps up to top rhic energies .",
    "the analysis has been performed within the statistical hadron - resonance gas model for different statistical ensembles  the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) , canonical ensemble ( ce ) , and micro - canonical ensemble ( mce )  and in the hadron - string - dynamics transport approach .",
    "we have found that the hsd results at sps energies are close to those in the ce and mce statistical model .",
    "this indicates a dominant role of resonance decays and global conservation laws at low energy nucleus - nucleus collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "substantial differences in hsd and statistical model results have been observed at rhic energies which can be attributed to non - equilibrium dynamical effects in the hsd simulations .",
    "the hsd results for @xmath59 appear to be close to the na49 data at the sps .",
    "the data for @xmath64 in pb+pb collisions at the sps energies will be available soon and allow for further insight .",
    "a comparison of the hsd results with preliminary star data in au+au collisions at rhic energies are not fully conclusive : @xmath58 from hsd calculations are approximately in agreement with data @xcite for kaon to proton ratio , but overestimate the experimental results @xcite for proton to pion ratio .",
    "new data on event - by - event fluctuations in au+au at rhic energies will help to clarify the situation .",
