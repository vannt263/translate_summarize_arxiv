    "more precisely , under interchanging @xmath90 , the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath13 , and @xmath69 transform as @xmath91 , and , consequently , we get @xmath92 . also for the general nc case , as seen from  ( [ h ] ) , the general duality transformations , not only depend on the @xmath69 , @xmath13 , and the integration constants @xmath37 and @xmath48 but also may depend on the noncommutativity parameter . in our model , due to presence of the three parameters @xmath48 , @xmath0 and @xmath25 , we can obtain a good variety of solutions for x and d branches , for more detail , see  @xcite . here , we are only interested in summarizing some of the results of case ia , namely , the lower sign with @xmath52 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 : ( i ) for very small negative values for the noncommutative parameter , we have shown that the scale factor starts from a singular point at @xmath95 and increases for both of the commutative and nc cases .",
    "however , it always does not have the same behavior for these cases .",
    "for the commutative case , we always get @xmath96 , while for the noncommutative case , for the very early times , we have @xmath96 , but at the special point , it turns to be negative ; namely , after a very small time , the phase changes and we obtain a decelerating universe .",
    "( ii ) the scalar field always drops for both of the commutative and nc cases .",
    "( iii ) the larger the integration constant @xmath48 , the shorter the time of the accelerating phase .",
    "( iv ) the smaller the @xmath97 , the larger the slope of @xmath98 , namely @xmath99 .",
    "( v ) in the late times , by assuming the same initial values for the parameters ( except @xmath25 ) , @xmath100 tends to zero for both the commutative and nc cases .",
    "however , for the large values of the cosmic time , in the commutative case , @xmath101 never takes a constant value . while , in the nc case , we get a zero acceleration epoch .",
    "in the previous section , by proposing a nc setting for the bd theory , we have mentioned that how we can overcome the graceful exit problem .",
    "however , these features alone do not guarantee a scenario for the resolution of the problems with the standard cosmology .    in this section ,",
    "we first investigate the nominal condition  @xcite for the acceleration associated to the inflation , namely , @xmath102 then , in the rest of this section , we will study the condition for sufficient inflation .    employing eqs .",
    "( [ phi - dot ] ) , ( [ h ] ) , and after some manipulations , we obtain @xmath103 using ( [ phi - dot ] ) and integrating over @xmath104 , we get @xmath105 up to a constant of integration . in eq .",
    "( [ nc - inflation-4 ] ) , we introduced a nc contribution of distance , @xmath106 , as @xmath107 we expect that @xmath106 can add a positive value to the @xmath108 to properly assist in satisfying the requirement associated to the horizon problem . in order to compare , by the aid of ( [ phi - dot ] ) , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) as @xmath109 . employing this result and ( [ nc - inflation-4 ] ) in the nominal condition ( [ nc - inflation-1 ] ) yields @xmath110 obviously , when @xmath25 goes to zero then @xmath106 vanishes , and , thus , the relation associated to the horizon distance of the commutative case is recovered .",
    "therefore , the resulted relation is the same as corresponding one in ref .",
    "@xcite provided that the bd coupling parameter takes constant values within .",
    "consequently , when @xmath53 the only acceptable result is @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , which is obtained by choosing either the upper sign for @xmath52 or the lower sign for @xmath51 .    for our herein nc case , it is important to emphasize that the nc parameter plays a significant role in determining whether the constraint  ( [ nominal - con ] ) is satisfied or not .",
    "as an example , for both the commutative and the nc ( case ia ) cases , in fig .",
    "[ nr ] , we have plotted @xmath113 versus cosmic time .",
    "this figure shows that the constraint  ( [ nominal - con ] ) , at all times , for the nc case can be easier satisfied than its corresponding commutative case .        in what follows , we investigate the condition for sufficient inflation , which is constrained as  @xcite @xmath114 the quantity appeared in lhs of the above inequality is comoving size of a causally connected region at a specific earlier time @xmath115 . from relation  ( [ nc - inflation-3 ] ) , for the specific time @xmath115 , we obtain @xmath116 we should note that the integration constant , which was removed in relation  ( [ nc - inflation-4 ] ) , has now been included in @xmath117 where the subscript @xmath118 stands for initial values . by assuming that @xmath49",
    ", we always have @xmath119 . in order to construct the inequality  ( [ suf - hor-3 ] ) in our herein nc model , which can be appropriately compared with the corresponding commutative one ,",
    "we have employed a few assumptions and a lot of manipulations .",
    "let us here just express the final result  @xcite : @xmath120 } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the time @xmath121 is devoted to the end of inflation in which the entropy is produced .",

    "the constraint  ( [ suf - hor - p ] ) is the generalized ( noncommutative ) version of the one resulted in  @xcite provided the bd coupling is taken as a constant therein .",
    "we should note that , in the commutative case , the constraint  ( [ suf - hor-3 ] ) , even with assuming a favorite set of initial conditions , implies that the quantity @xmath126 decreases with the cosmic time , which also indicates that the planck mass must decrease during inflation . consequently , to get an admissible result , a branch change must be induced  @xcite .",
    "in the nc case , considering the lower sign with @xmath52 ( d branch ) and employing  ( [ nc - inflation-3 ] ) ,  ( [ h ] ) and the expression for @xmath127 , we obtain @xmath128 $ ] , which , for the commutative case , is reduced to @xmath129 .",
    "it is easy to show that that , for the commutative case , the quantity @xmath130 always decreases with the cosmic time , see fig .",
    "[ d - branch ] .",
    "we should emphasize that such a result is not in agreement with the observational data  @xcite .",
    "for a general nc case , fortunately , for @xmath52 , @xmath94 , and lower case , i.e. , the d branch , we have shown numerically that at the early times , @xmath130 behaves similar to its corresponding in the commutative case .",
    "however , after reaching a nonzero minimum , it starts to increase , see  fig .",
    "[ d - branch ] .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a nc bd setting .",
    "such a scenario bears much resemblance to the settings assumed in nc quantum cosmology or a few classical noncommutative gravitational / cosmological investigations in theories alternative to general relativity  @xcite ) .",
    "we have constructed a nc generalized bd setting to include key ideas of duality and branch changing as well as gravity - driven acceleration and kinetic inflation .",
    "then , we have assumed that @xmath19 and there is neither a scalar potential nor a cosmological constant .",
    "moreover , we have assumed that the lagrangian density of the ordinary matter is absent .    in this scenario , we have found that the power - law scale factor of the universe is not similar to the commutative case , but instead it is generalized to be multiplied with a time - dependent exponential warp factor .",
    "moreover , we have seen that the bd scalar field is not in the form of a simple power function of time ( similar to its corresponding commutative case ) , but instead , it can be obtained from a more complicated differential equation . for @xmath53 , we have shown that our herein model yields an extended model of the de sitter  like space and ohanlon - tupper solutions . in the latter ,",
    "the integration constants play the role of the duality transformations introduced in the context of the bd theory  @xcite .    for case",
    "ia , we have shown that the scale factor always accelerates in the commutative case , while , for the nc case , it accelerates only for very early times , and after a very short time , it turns to give a decelerated universe .",
    "consequently , our model can be an appropriate inflationary model , in which we can overcome the graceful exit problem .",
    "moreover , contrary to the commutative model in which the scale factor always accelerates in late times , we get a zero acceleration epoch for the universe in the nc case .",
    "it has believed that this result can be interpreted as coarse - grained explanation of the quantum gravity footprint .",
    "we have shown that both the nominal and sufficient requirements associated to the inflation can be fully satisfied in our nc model .    in the bd theory with a variable @xmath0  @xcite , for a kinetic inflation model , all the accelerations in the d branch suffer from the graceful exit problem . however , for our nc model , we have shown that his problem is appropriately solved due to the presence of the nc parameter : at the very early times , although , the same as the commutative case , @xmath130 decreases with the cosmic time , while after a very short time , it starts to increase with time , which is in agreement with observations .",
