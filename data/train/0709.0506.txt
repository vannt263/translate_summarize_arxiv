    "measurements of the mass of the coma cluster date back to @xcite who first applied the virial theorem to coma and showed that dark matter dominates the cluster on megaparsec scales .",
    "since then a number of methods have been used to determine the mass of coma under various assumptions .",
    "@xcite used the galaxy surface density profile to measure the mass under the assumption that the mass traces the galaxy distribution .",
    "@xcite later used this dataset to measure the mass with a modified version of the virial theorem .",
    "@xcite used x - ray data under the assumption that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "more recently @xcite used the cluster infall region of coma to extrapolate the mass out to @xmath3 as well as to determine the virial mass .",
    "weak lensing has become a powerful tool with which to measure the mass of galaxy clusters @xcite . here",
    "the shape distortion of background galaxies due to a foreground cluster is used to determine the mass of the cluster independent of dynamical assumptions .",
    "the shear induced on the background galaxies can be used to probe the mass of the foreground cluster out to large radii . the majority of galaxy clusters studied with weak lensing lie at redshift @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however lower redshift clusters have been probed using this method , for instance @xcite studied abell 3667 at @xmath5 . at very low redshifts weak lensing measurements of clusters",
    "become difficult since this requires imaging of a large area surrounding the cluster .",
    "the possibility of a weak lensing study of the coma cluster @xmath6 with the sdss was first suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that since coma is at such a low redshift the weak lensing signal would be measurable in the sdss since virtually all background galaxies would be at a much higher redshift than coma .",
    "this is in spite of the shallow imaging in the sdss which yields a typical background galaxy surface density of @xmath7 galaxy @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "complete imaging of the entire region surrounding the coma cluster was recently completed in the sdss data release five @xcite .",
    "here we present a weak lensing measurement of the virial mass of the coma cluster in the sdss .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in @xmath9 we discuss our weak lensing analysis , in @xmath10 our determination of the mass of coma is discussed , and in @xmath11 we compare our weak lensing mass estimate to previous measurements of the virial mass of coma .",
    "since coma is at such a low redshift our results do not change significantly for different density parameters .",
    "however for completeness we have assumed a standard cosmology with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "data used in our study are obtained from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite a large imaging and spectroscopic survey of an 8000 square degree region in the northern galactic cap centered on @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the sdss uses a dedicated 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory which images the sky in the @xmath16 bands @xcite in a drift scan mode @xcite .",
    "the astrometric calibration of the sdss is described in @xcite and the photometric calibration is described in @xcite and @xcite . for our analysis",
    "we use the sdss data release five @xcite which contains complete imaging of the region surrounding coma .",
    "object detection and shape measurement are performed using the photo pipeline @xcite .",
    "photo measures a large number of parameters for each detected object in the sdss @xcite , including adaptive moments @xcite which we use to measure galaxy shapes . in the sdss adaptive moments",
    "are measured using an iterative algorithm which adapts a gaussian weight function to the size and shape of each galaxy @xcite .",
    "photo convolves each image with the local psf before detecting objects in order to avoid the selection bias described in @xcite .",
    "drift scanning in the sdss creates a time dependent psf which leads to a spatial variation in image quality . to model the psf in the sdss a karhunen - loeve ( kl ) decomposition is used , described in further detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "camera shear due to drift scanning in the sdss has been previously shown to be small @xcite .    for our weak lensing analysis",
    "we use a @xmath0 square degree region centered on the core of the coma cluster .",
    "the core of coma contains two bright cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) : ngc 4874 & ngc 4889 .",
    "we take as the center of coma the galaxy ncg 4874 located at @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( j2000 ) .",
    "this bcg is associated with the majority of the x - ray flux in the core @xcite and the large number of galaxies surrounding this bcg in the optical imaging is indicative of this being the center of the cluster potential ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we in fact find that the shear amplitude is maximized when we use this bcg as the cluster center .",
    "to create our source galaxy catalog we use only objects which have been detected in all three @xmath19 filters .",
    "we eliminate objects which contain saturated pixels , were originally blended with another object , or triggered errors in the measurement of adaptive moments by rejecting objects with the respective photo error flag set . for our study",
    "we use only objects which have been classified by photo as galaxies @xmath20 .",
    "we additionally use only shape measurements from the @xmath21 band since this filter is the most sensitive and typically contains better seeing @xcite .",
    "galaxies are selected in the @xmath21 band with extinction corrected model magnitudes @xcite in the range @xmath22 ( figure [ fig : mag ] ) .",
    "model magnitudes are used here instead of petrosian magnitudes since these provide a higher s / n @xcite .",
    "galaxies with fainter magnitudes have been used in galaxy - galaxy weak lensing studies in the sdss @xcite , but here we restrict our sample to the magnitude range where errors in shape measurements are typically small @xcite and galaxy sizes are larger .    in our analysis",
    "we use photometric redshifts for our source galaxies .",
    "the sdss photometric redshift pipeline of @xcite is used since it completely covers the area of coma in data release five .",
    "galaxies in our magnitude range are typically at much higher redshift than coma , but we use photometric redshifts here to aid in the rejection of fainter cluster members . for our study",
    "we use only galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range @xmath23 and redshift errors @xmath24 .",
    "galaxies with lower photometric redshifts are not used as the fractional error in redshift rapidly increases and most of the shear signal comes from galaxies at high redshifts compared to coma .    to correct for the psf anisotropy and dilution we use the linear psf correction scheme of @xcite .",
    "this algorithm uses the measured galaxy ellipticity and reconstructed psf at the position of the object to correct the ellipticity components of each galaxy .",
    "we use galaxies with corrected ellipticities @xmath25 in our analysis , which is typical for weak lensing studies in the sdss @xcite .",
    "we additionally make a cut on the resolution parameter @xmath26 , defined as @xmath27 @xcite where @xmath28 is the size of the galaxy and @xmath29 is the size of the psf at the position of the galaxy as calculated by photo . for our analysis",
    "we use only galaxies with @xmath30 , which is equivalent to only using objects @xmath31 times larger than the psf .",
    "we additionally rotate the psf corrected ellipticity components of each galaxy from image coordinates to the equatorial coordinate system .    within the annulus described in @xmath32 ,",
    "the total number of galaxies in our source galaxy catalog after applying these cuts is @xmath33 .",
    "the shear due to coma is measured by projecting the psf corrected ellipticity components of each source galaxy to the tangential frame and binning the galaxies into radial annuli between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the edge of the inner annulus is chosen to be larger than the einstein radius of coma @xmath36 to ensure we are outside of the strong lensing regime , and also to avoid contamination from the bcgs . since our radial annuli extend out to @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , we modify the usual flat sky shear matrix into a curved sky shear matrix , following @xcite .",
    "the tangential shear is measured using @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the tangential shear , @xmath41 is the tangential ellipticity , n is the total number of objects in each radial bin , and @xmath42 is the shear responsivity described in @xcite .",
    "we chose not to use any ellipticity error weighting here since our galaxies are selected in a magnitude range where source galaxy ellipticity error is typically small in the sdss @xcite .",
    "we additionally also chose not to weight each source galaxy by the critical surface mass density because all of our source galaxies are at a much higher redshift than coma and therefore the weights are very nearly equal . in the case of no weights , the shear responsivity is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the shape noise ( the width of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution per ellipticity component ) @xcite . here",
    "we use a shape noise of @xmath45 which was used previously in @xcite for the same source galaxy magnitude range .",
    "the resulting shear profile for coma is shown in figure [ fig : shear ] .",
    "we expect to detect the shear out to @xmath46 , and the shear ( solid squares ) is clearly detected in these inner bins . also shown in figure [ fig : shear ]",
    "is a null test ( open triangles ) where each source galaxy is rotated by @xmath47 .",
    "the shear signal should dissappear after this rotation if the signal is due to lensing .",
    "errors shown for both quantities in figure [ fig : shear ] are @xmath48 error bars , where @xmath49 is the standard deviation of the mean in each radial bin .    to statistically test the significance of our measured shear signal we test",
    "whether it is consistent with the null shear model ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we find that our measured shear gives a @xmath51 for @xmath52 degrees of freedom for the null model .",
    "the probability of obtaining a reduced @xmath53 greater than this value is @xmath54 , and therefore we can reject the null hypothesis . for comparison , fitting the shear from the @xmath47 test to the null model gives a @xmath55 for @xmath52 degrees of freedom , which is consistent with the null hypothesis .      to test that our signal is not affected by any remaining systematic in the survey , we split up the sdss north into separate , non - overlapping ` coma sized ' patches that contained no galaxies used in our coma analysis and which contained no large sections of missing data .",
    "we were able to successfully extract 6 blank fields in dr5 each @xmath56 wide . from the center of each patch we probed radially outward to @xmath37 at the redshift of coma .",
    "we applied the same cuts to the source galaxy catalog in each of the blank fields that were used in our coma analysis in @xmath57 .",
    "the resulting inverse variance weighted average signal over all fields is shown in figure [ fig : blank ] , where we have used the same binning as in our coma analysis .",
    "the tangential shear signal is shown with solid squares and the @xmath47 component is shown with open triangles .",
    "the tangential shear component is consistent with the null model giving a @xmath58 for @xmath52 degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath47 component gives a @xmath59 for @xmath52 degrees of freedom which has a probability @xmath60 . a model with a small positive shear is slightly favored for the @xmath47 component , however the null model can only be excluded at the @xmath61 level .",
    "the field to field scatter in the blank field shear measurements shows a typical standard deviation in a given radial bin of @xmath62 or a standard deviation of the mean of @xmath63 , similar in magnitude to the statistical errors that are plotted in figure [ fig : blank ] . in principle",
    "the scatter over the blank fields can provide information on the error due to large scale structure ( @xcite ; also  [ sec : error ] below ) , but our determination of the scatter is limited by the finite number of blanks fields .",
    "the tangential shear due to a foreground cluster lens is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the average projected surface mass density interior to @xmath21 , and @xmath66 is the projected surface mass density at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the shear also depends on the critical surface mass density @xmath67 which is determined by @xmath68 here @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens and source respectively , and @xmath71 is the angular diameter distance between the lens and source .    to compute the critical surface mass density we use for the lens the exact spectroscopic redshift of coma @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we assume here that the peculiar velocity for coma is zero , which has been shown in several studies @xcite .",
    "photometric redshifts are used to calculate the source angular diameter distances , and we obtain a critical surface mass density of @xmath73 . for comparison",
    "this is nearly the value obtained if we assume all of our sources were at a fixed redshift of @xmath74 .      since the s / n of our data is low @xmath75 we chose to fit the measured shear profile of coma to a model .",
    "we fit the shear to that expected from a navarro , frenk , & white ( nfw ) profile @xcite .",
    "the nfw profile is a `` universal profile '' found in n - body simulations to fit mass density profiles ranging from galaxies to galaxy clusters .",
    "the density of an nfw profile is described by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the halo overdensity , @xmath78 is the scale radius , and @xmath79 is the critical density at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "the halo overdensity is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the halo concentration .",
    "the nfw model is therefore determined by only two parameters @xmath81 and @xmath78 which are highly correlated .",
    "the nfw model can be used to determine the virial radius @xmath82 defined as the radius in which the interior mass density falls to @xmath83 .",
    "the corresponding virial mass @xmath84 is given by @xmath85    the expected shear due to an nfw profile has been worked out in detail by @xcite and we use their result in our analysis . because the nfw profile is highly non - linear , we use the levenberg - marquardt fitting procedure in @xcite to determine the virial radius and the halo concentration .",
    "we find that the values which minimize @xmath86 are given by @xmath87 and @xmath88 the concentration parameter is not well constrained .",
    "this fit gives a @xmath89 for 4 degrees of freedom which has a @xmath90 probability of occuring .",
    "this corresponds to a virial mass of @xmath91 our values of @xmath92 and @xmath84 remain constant if the number of bins is slightly changed , and therefore our choice of binning does not bias this result .",
    "it has been shown previously that large scale structure affects the errors in the fit parameters of weak lensing measurements @xcite , however this is not considered in our fit errors .",
    "we discuss additional sources of systematic error not included in our fit in @xmath93 .",
    "we compare our weak lensing mass estimate with three other methods used to determine the virial mass of coma : ( 1 ) the virial theorem ( 2 ) x - ray and ( 3 ) the infall region .",
    "our value for @xmath84 is consistently higher than the previous measurements , though never by more that @xmath94 .",
    "these comparisons are summarized in table [ tab : mass ] .",
    "we also discuss sources of additional error not included in our mass measurement , as well as the source of any potential bias .",
    "@xcite used a sample of galaxies in coma along with the virial theorem to measure its mass .",
    "their analysis also accounted for an additional portion of the system that may have been missing in their spectroscopic sample . relaxing the assumption that light traces mass in the system , they found that the mass varied over a wide range .",
    "however , assuming that the mass traces the galaxy distribution they found a mass within @xmath95 of @xmath96 with a @xmath97 error in mass .",
    "our weak lensing measurement is consistent with this result to within @xmath98 .",
    "our weak lensing measurement is also consistent with the previous x - ray analysis of @xcite .",
    "this study used the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium but avoided certain assumptions about the state of the gas and also accounted for many systematic effects .",
    "the best fit model was one in which mass traces light , giving a virial mass of @xmath99 within @xmath100 which is within @xmath101 of our result .      using a redshift survey of @xmath102 galaxies",
    "@xcite used the infall region of coma to determine its mass . in redshift space galaxies falling into the potential well of the cluster",
    "are used to determine the amplitude of the redshift caustics ( the boundaries in line of sight velocity vs. projected radius ) @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the caustics along with the assumptions of spherical symmetry and hierarchal clustering are directly related to the cluster gravitational potential . using this technique they find an nfw model fits the mass well giving an estimate for @xmath103 which yields an @xmath104 .",
    "error bars are not quoted for their virial radius or mass ; however , our weak lensing virial mass is in agreement with their central result to within @xmath105      weak lensing measurements of the mass of clusters , in particular low redshift clusters , suffer from two sources of additional error : ( 1 ) distant large scale structure and ( 2 ) correlated structure near the cluster @xcite .",
    "weak lensing is sensitive to all structure along the sight and it has been shown that any background structure introduces additional error in the weak lensing mass estimate of clusters @xcite . specifically for the case of the coma cluster , @xcite showed that the error due to large scale structure increases with imaging depth , thus limiting the total achievable s / n for coma to @xmath106 . in our study",
    "the imaging depth in sdss is relatively shallow so the contribution of large scale structure to the total error budget is small . for future deep imaging surveys which will also cover the area of coma such as panstarrs @xcite",
    ", the error due to large scale structure will be more significant .",
    "the effect of correlated structure ( such as filaments ) near a foreground cluster has been previously studied using n - body simulations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here it was shown that filaments can increase the statistical error in weak lensing mass estimates as well as cause the measured @xmath84 to be biased toward higher values . in principle coma should be an interesting testing ground to study this effect since the neighboring structure is well understood .",
    "however in practice there is not a clear method to correct a weak lensing measured value of @xmath84 for this effect , and therefore we leave a study of any potential bias in our measurement for a future paper .",
    "we have measured the weak lensing shear due to the coma cluster , currently the lowest redshift @xmath6 largest angle weak lensing measurement of an individual cluster to date .",
    "our analysis is performed using the sdss which is the only imaging survey that covers a large enough area to measure the shear due to coma .",
    "we find the shear can be fit well to an nfw profile and have compared our weak lensing derived mass estimate to dynamical methods which have been used to probe the mass of coma out to large radius . in particular we have compared our weak lensing mass to the mass derived using the virial theorem @xcite , x - ray data @xcite , and the cluster infall region @xcite .",
    "we find the virial mass of coma from weak lensing is consistent with the mass derived using these other techniques , though the error from weak lensing is larger .",
    "we thank the fermilab clusters group for useful comments during the course of this work .",
