    "while the large regular moons of the giant planets follow almost circular , low inclination , prograde orbits , the aptly named irregular moons tend to do the opposite : i.e. , they often have highly eccentric , high inclination orbits which may be retrograde _ or _ prograde",
    ". these moons , therefore , provide actual observational examples of the complexities of three - body dynamics .",
    "irregular moons are thought to have been captured during the early stages of the solar system but the detailed mechanism has not been fully elucidated . based on a study of",
    "the circular restricted three - body problem we have recently proposed that chaos played a key role in the initial stages of capture @xcite ; in this mechanism  called chaos assisted capture ( cac )",
    " particles may initially become entangled in chaotic layers which separate directly scattering from regular ( bound ) regions of phase space .",
    "this temporary trapping serves to extend the lifetimes of particles within the hill sphere thereby providing the breathing space necessary for relatively weak dissipative forces ( e.g. , gas - drag ) to effect permanent capture .",
    "while this basic scenario may be responsible for the _ initial _ formation of families of irregular moons , other factors may affect their subsequent long term evolution including collisions ; gravitational perturbations from other planets ; and deviations from circularity of the planet s orbit . here",
    "we investigate the effect of orbital ellipticity of the planet on the capture mechanism using monte carlo simulations and phase space visualisations based on the fast lyapunov indicator .",
    "two representative star - planet binaries are considered : the actual sun - jupiter system and a hypothetical extrasolar cousin of higher orbital eccentricity .",
    "we find that the chaos - assisted capture mechanism is robust to moderate ellipticities .",
    "recent discoveries of numerous irregular moons at giant planets @xcite have spurred the development of theories of their origin , which is generally thought to involve capture ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these moons are considered to be primordial pieces of the solar system captured in the amber of time . while there is , as yet ,",
    "no consensus on the detailed capture mechanism of these minor bodies a number of recent studies have , nevertheless , attemped to simulate their post - capture evolution in order to explain salient aspects of their orbits .",
    "for example , several attempts have recently been made to explain the observed clustering of irregular satellites as being the result either of the breakup of a larger parent body or from catastrophic collisions between planetesimals @xcite .",
    "these hypotheses are supported empirically by photometric surveys @xcite which indicate that members of the clusters have similar surface colours suggesting that they may have had common progenitors . however , whatever post - capture orbital evolution occurs _ within _ the hill sphere there has to have been an initial capture mechanism efficient enough to populate the hill sphere with moonlets in the first place .",
    "we have recently proposed one such mechanism  chaos - assisted capture @xcite  in which long - term , but temporary , trapping occurs in the ` sticky ' chaotic layers lying close to kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) tori embedded within the planet s hill sphere .",
    "if a particle gets entangled in one of these layers then even a moderate level of dissipation ( or , alternatively , slow planetary growth , @xcite ) may be sufficient to make capture permanent .",
    "it is likely that comet - shoemaker - levy 9 was a recent example of an object trapped in such a chaotic zone for the best part of the last century @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of a large gas cloud at jupiter makes contemporary permanent capture of such objects by gas - drag unfeasible .",
    "qualitatively , in the cac model the capture probability of a planet is largely determined by the volume of phase space ( at a given energy ) taken up by chaotic zones within the hill sphere .",
    "simulations in the circular restricted three - body problem ( crtbp ) show that capture becomes less probable at higher energies because most of the phase space is directly scattering and relatively few kam tori survive ; those that do are surrounded by relatively thin chaotic layers which are less effective at trapping intruders @xcite .",
    "factors that are not included in the crtbp may also affect the capture mechanism , e.g. , the eccentricity of the parent planet s orbit .",
    "a more realistic extension of cac beyond the crtbp is , therefore , needed . as a first step we extend the model to the _ elliptic restricted three - body problem _",
    "( ertbp , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) which allows us to model perturbations induced by deviations of the planet s orbit from circularity .",
    "while orbital eccentricities are relatively small , although not negligible , for the giant planets of the solar system they may be appreciable for extrasolar planets ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , compare jupiter s mean orbital eccentricity @xmath1 to typical extrasolar planet eccentricities which lie in the range @xmath2 @xcite . up to",
    "now there have been more than 100 extrasolar planetary systems detected and an intriguing question is whether these massive planets might harbour moons @xcite which might be habitable @xcite . as an exemplary extrasolar captor , we study a system similar in mass ratio to the idealized sun - jupiter binary but which follows a highly elliptic orbit .",
    "this provides a comparative estimate for the probability of capture and also suggests the ranges of energy and orbital inclination over which extrasolar irregular moons might be expected to exist .    the paper is organized as follows : section 2 introduces the hamiltonian for the ertbp which , in the limit of zero ellipticity , reduces to the crtbp .",
    "we work in a coordinate system whose origin coincides with the planet and , in actual integrations , regularise the dynamics to deal with two - body collisions @xcite . because the ertbp is explicitly time dependent it is not possible to compute conventional poincar surfaces of section ( sos , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) even in the planar limit",
    "so as to visualise the structure of phase space . therefore we use the notion of a fast lyapunov indicator ( fli , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to visualise the structure of phase space .",
    "section 3 briefly discusses the cac mechanism as applied to the crtbp in order to facilitate comparison with the ertbp .",
    "in particular , fli on the surfaces of section are computed which can be compared directly with sos in the crtbp .",
    "this is done in sec .  4 where monte carlo simulations of capture are performed .",
    "unlike in @xcite in these simulations we do not include dissipation and , instead , focus on the distributions of particles that can be temporarily trapped in chaotic zones for very long time periods .",
    "this avoids complications associated with the best choice of dissipative force ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , conclusions are contained in sec .",
    "the crtbp describes the dynamics of a test particle having infinitesimal mass and moving in the gravitational field of two massive bodies ( the ` primaries '  e.g. , a planet and a star ) which revolve around their center of mass on a circular orbit .",
    "the equations of motion are , therefore , most naturally presented in a non - inertial coordinate system that rotates with the mean motion of the primaries @xcite . in the rotating coordinate system the positions of the primaries are fixed .",
    "when the planet s orbit is elliptic rather than circular a nonuniformly rotating - pulsating coordinate system is commonly used .",
    "these new coordinates have the felicitous property that , again , the positions of the primaries are fixed ; however the hamiltonian is explicitly time - dependent @xcite .      for our purposes",
    "it is most convenient to locate the origin at the planet ( fig .",
    "[ zvs ] ) because angular momentum will be measured with respect to the planet .",

    "note that the orbital inclination @xmath23 is invariant under isotropic pulsating rescaling from crtbp to ertbp .",
    "the orbit is said prograde if @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and retrograde otherwise .",
    "the hamiltonian of the elliptic problem ( [ ertbp ] ) is a periodic function of the true anomaly @xmath13 ( which plays the role of time ) and , hence , generates a non - autonomous dynamical system . unlike the circular problem",
    ", the ertbp does not possess an energy integral and , evidently , no such useful guiding concept as a static zero - velocity surface @xcite can be introduced .",

    "numerical integrations were done using a bulirsch - stoer adaptive integrator @xcite .",
    "one approach to visualising phase space structures in systems with greater than 2 degrees - of - freedom relies on computations of short - time lyapunov exponents ( le ) over sets of initial conditions of interest ( for recent developments and relevant applications see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein , although the idea of using finite - time le itself dates back at least to @xcite ) . as was demonstrated by @xcite various dynamical regimes ( including resonances )",

    "as distinct from the largest lyapunov characteristic exponent @xcite @xmath35 which just tends to zero for any regular orbit , the more sensitive fli can help discriminate between resonant and non - resonant regular orbits @xcite .",
    "although , in practice , detection of resonances may be tricky , since real differences in fli for quasiperiodic and periodic orbits of the same island are not always huge .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the cac mechanism described in @xcite as applied to the crtbp . even though the basic mechanism applies in three - dimensions , it is simpler here to outline the general scheme in terms of the planar version of the crtbp .",

    "the dotted vertical line indicates the first crossing of the hill sphere ( escape).,width=264 ]    level curves of the zvs , similar to a potential energy surface ( pes ) , serve to limit the motion in the rotating frame and so define an energetically accessible region that may intersect the hill sphere .",
    "however , unlike a pes , because the zvs is defined in a rotating frame , it is possible for energy maxima to be stable as is , in fact , the case for @xmath38 and @xmath27 at which points jupiter s trojan asteroids are situated @xcite .",
    "the hill sphere ( see fig .  [ zvs ] ) roughly occupies the region between the saddle points @xmath26 and @xmath29 which we term the ` capture zone ' with its radius being given by @xmath39 where @xmath7 is the planet s semimajor axis @xcite . in the case of ertbp",
    "the zvs pulsates , which defines periodically time - dependent capture regions @xcite .",
    "the two lagrange saddle points @xmath26 and @xmath29 act as gateways between the hill sphere and heliocentric orbits .",
    "a key finding of @xcite is that at energies close to ( but above ) the lagrange points only prograde orbits can enter ( or exit ) the capture zone . at higher capture energies the distribution shifts to include both senses of @xmath40 until , finally , retrograde capture becomes more likely .",
    "the statistics of inclination distributions will , therefore , be expected to depend strongly on energy , i.e. , how the curves of zero - velocity intersect the hill sphere . fig .",
    "[ sos ] portrays the structure of phase space in the planar limit ( @xmath41 ) in a series of poincar surfaces of section at four energies . at the lowest energy shown in fig .",
    "[ sos](a ) many of the prograde orbits are chaotic whereas all the retrograde orbits are regular . because incoming orbits can not penetrate the regular kam tori , prograde orbits must remain prograde while retrograde orbits can not be captured nor can already bound retrograde orbits escape .",

    "[ sos](b ) the chaotic  sea  of prograde orbits quickly ` evaporates ' except for a ` sticky ' layer of chaos which clings to the kam tori . with increasing energy",
    "this front evolves from prograde to retrograde motion .",
    "chaotic orbits close to the remaining tori can become trapped in almost regular orbits for very long times . in the presence of dissipation these chaotic orbits can be smoothly switched into the nearby kam region and almost always preserve the sign of angular momentum .",
    "thus , at low ( high ) energy permanent capture is almost always into prograde ( retrograde ) orbits .",
    "in this section we describe the results of our simulations in the planar ertbp using the fli and our monte carlo simulations in the spatial ertbp .",
    "we are primarily interested here in obtaining a qualitative picture of the volume and structure of phase space occupied by the chaotic layer in the ertbp as compared to the crtbp . for this",
    "we find a good diagnostic to be @xmath42 whose increase for chaotic orbits can usually be detected before , or no later than , a test particle finally escapes from the capture zone ( fig .",
    "[ escape ] ) .",
    "these measurements , when made over the capture region ( which contains permanently bound regular trajectories _ even at energies well above @xmath26 and @xmath29 _ ) , provide an estimate of the number of orbits that could be captured as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fract ] .",
    "the number of chaotic orbits inside the capture zone , detected by computing fli , decreases with increasing ellipticity for moderate eccentricities ( fig .",
    "[ fract](a ) ) signifying that the chaotic layers get weaker and , therefore , capture is expected to become less probable than it is at @xmath19 .",
    "ideally the problem of separating the fractions of temporarily trapped and almost immediately escaping trajectories could be better quantified by partitioning the phase space into disjoint ( e.g. ` inner ' , hill sphere , and ` outer ' , heliocentric space ) regions and computing the fluxes across the barriers between them .",
    "but , given the current state of phase space transport theory , this has not yet been shown possible in practice for essentially 3d problems such as the spatial crtbp and ertbp hamiltonians .",
    "interestingly enough , despite strong theoretical grounds @xcite , and exhausting attempts , efforts to describe quantitatively spatial three - body dynamics by constructing global invariant manifolds @xcite , that would presumably contain all possible incoming and outgoing chaotic trajectories through @xmath26 and @xmath29 saddle points , have been not quite successful in approaching the 3d problem so far .",
    "part of the reason is that multiple escapes and recurrences of high energy trajectories to the hill sphere ( see example on fig .  [ escape]a , b ) make local manifolds near multidimensional saddles extremely difficult to use as rigorous surfaces of no return .",
    "this is even more pronounced for chaotic ionization of atomic rydberg electrons ( @xcite ; @xcite ) which is closely related to rtbp dynamics .",

    "the setting , thereby , allows for a direct comparison between the sos of fig .",
    "[ sos ] and results obtained using the fli . due to the dimensionality of the ertbp , relaxation of the above constraint , e.g. choosing the initial true anomalies at random , produced fli maps with no distinct structure . on the contrary ,",
    "consistency in initial conditions at fixed @xmath53 helps track the smooth changes from crtbp to ertbp .    as the planet s orbital eccentricity",
    "is increased to reach its actual value for jupiter , fli maps reveal a reduction of the density of orbits within the chaotic layers ( yellow paterns ) visible on fig .",
    "[ fli](d - f ) at each of the corresponding energies shown .",
    "however , at this moderate eccentricity , the phase space structures responsible for cac ( ` sticky ' kam tori surrounded by the chaotic layers ) generally survive any deviations introduced by ellipticity .",
    "this suggests robustness of the cac mechanism with respect to actual ellipticities of the giant planets orbits which lie well below @xmath56 ( see fig .",
    "[ fract ] ) .",
    "we further confirm this by direct monte carlo simulations of capture probability ( sec .",
    "4.2 ) which reveal that cac indeed survives weak ellipticity in the rtbp .",
    "an important implication for future studies can be drawn by noticing that the heliocentric orbits of pluto ( with charon ) as well as of some recently discovered binary trans - neptunian objects are quite eccentric ( see examples on fig .",
    "[ fract ] ) , but not to the extent characteristic of extrasolars ( although the relative orbit of the binary partners as distinct from the heliocentric orbit of the combine can be very eccentric ) .",
    "these binary objects can be viewed in the framework of the hill approximation too , so the weakly elliptic chaos - assisted mutual capture , probably stabilized by the fast exchange of energy and angular momentum with a fourth body , may have been involved in early stages of their formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the picture at much higher eccentricities evolves towards significant distorsions of the phase space stuctures as visualised by fli . in fig .",
    "[ fli](g  i ) the kam tori ( red  blue islands ) shrink , giving way to regions of scattering and chaotic orbits with short ( 200 years in this example ) residence times inside the hill sphere .",
    "these short - lived trajectories are the main contributions to the rapidly increasing number of chaotic orbits observed in fig .",
    "[ fract ] for @xmath57 .",
    "this does not mean , however , that capture will necessarily be enhanced , because a high density of strongly chaotic orbits does not correlate with the number of very long - lived trajectories trapped close to kam tori .    on the other hand , lyapunov exponents computed for individual trajectories can not serve as a predictor of global stability , i.e. as an indicator of whether an orbit will stay long enough in a bound region , or if it escapes quickly .",
    "this aspect in computing lyapunov exponents for escaping ( captured ) trajectories concerns the notion of ` stable chaos ' @xcite .",
    "this term was coined to refer to chaotic motions that are locally hyperbolic , but demonstrate macroscopic long - term stability , so that the lyapunov time @xmath58 ( the inverse of the largest lyapunov exponent ( [ lyap ] ) ) is substantially less than the event time @xmath59 , e.g. the time for a trajectory to leave a certain region . however , there are indications of a possible simple linear correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath58 as shown in @xcite , which suggests that knowledge of the lyapunov time could allow one to predict an event time . concerning the residence ( escape ) time near the planet , simulations in the planar crtbp , however , show that such a correlation with the lyapunov time does not exist ( fig",
    ".  [ l_times ] , see also discussion by @xcite and @xcite ) . among the randomly chosen escaping chaotic trajectories originating in the hill sphere , there are many very long - lived examples that have diverse , even quite small , lyapunov times .",
    "this means that local ( microscopic ) instabilities in the chaotic layer alone can not explain the distributions of survival probability .",
    "rather , as was pointed out by @xcite , long - term trapping with short @xmath58 near ` sticky ' kam structures can be attributed to the existence of phase space quasi - barriers and approximate integrals of motion . in the case of rtbp , these are the phase space structures around the saddle points at @xmath26 and @xmath29 and the @xmath21-component of angular momentum with respect to the planet , respectively . in 3d , the latter is approximately conserved @xcite for long - lived chaotic orbits which explains the unexpected strong correlation between initial and final inclinations of captured particles (  inclination memory ",
    "we simulated capture statistics in the spatial ( three - dimensional ) ertbp by integrating isotropic fluxes of test particles that bombard the capture zone producing equal probabilities of initial conditions .",
    "initial conditions were generated as follows : the particle s position vector was chosen uniformly and randomly on the surface of the hill sphere .",

    "although permanently bound , these orbits could never actually have been captured because kam regions can not be penetrated at all in 2d and only exponentially slowly in 3d .",
    "it is only in the chaotic layer between scattering and stability that capture can happen .",
    "an initial swarm of incoming particles produces broad distribution of survivors with different residence times inside the hill sphere .",
    "we monitored its dynamics up to certain cut - off times ( of the order of several thousand years ) to find those long - lived chaotic orbits that may have been vulnerable to capture by a relatively weak dissipative force such as gas drag .",
    "only these orbits , in the cac model , could be the precursors to the currently observed distributions of irregular satellites . in a statistical sense ,",
    "any short - time flybys are unlikely to have contributed to the primordial population of potential moons .",
    "also , since the sun - jupiter system was chosen as an example , we eliminated test particles that penetrated the inner region of the hill sphere occupied by jupiter s most influencial regular moon callisto .",
    "the massive regular moons may have acted as a source of strong perturbation removing some temporarily captured moonlets following prograde orbits .",

    "this is clearly seen upon comparing fig.[prob ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the latter shows the capture probability for the sun - jupiter system with its actual eccentricity being used .",

    "we note , however , that since the energy is not a conserved quantity in the elliptic problem , a better representation of results is given in terms of inclinations .",
    "the most prominent effect observed in the ertpb compared to the circular case is the overall decrease of capture probability as eccentricity increases .",
    "simulations indicate that , given the same time scale , the actual ellipticity of jupiter s orbit accounts for approximately an order of magnitude lower capture probability than predicted by the circular model , while the relative number of progrades _ versus _ retrogrades remains unaffected .",

    "<S> several families of irregular moons orbit the giant planets . these moons are thought to have been captured into planetocentric orbits after straying into a region in which the planet s gravitation dominates solar perturbations ( the hill sphere ) . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism requires a source of dissipation , such as gas - drag , in order to make capture permanent . </S>",
    "<S> however , capture by gas - drag requires that particles remain inside the hill sphere long enough for dissipation to be effective . </S>",
    "<S> recently we have proposed that in the circular restricted three - body problem particles may become caught up in ` sticky ' chaotic layers which tends to prolong their sojourn within the planet s hill sphere thereby assisting capture . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that this mechanism survives perturbations due to the ellipticity of the planet s orbit . </S>",
    "<S> however , monte carlo simulations indicate that the planet s ability to capture moons decreases with increasing orbital eccentricity . at the actual jupiter s </S>",
    "<S> orbital eccentricity , this effects in approximately an order of magnitude lower capture probability than estimated in the circular model . </S>",
    "<S> eccentricities of planetary orbits in the solar system are moderate but this is not necessarily the case for extrasolar planets which typically have rather eccentric orbits . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our findings suggest that these extrasolar planets are unlikely to have substantial populations of irregular moons .    </S>",
