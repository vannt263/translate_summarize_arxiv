    "therefore @xmath114 and @xmath661 form 2gons which are disjoint from @xmath1234 and hence from @xmath1233 .",
    "it follows that @xmath18 is isotopic in @xmath26 to a homeomorphism equal to the identity on all curves @xmath1239 .",
    "but then it is a homeomorphism of the annulus @xmath19 so it is isotopic to a power of @xmath1242 .",
    "the second sequence is described in @xcite , theorem 4.3 .",
    "the kernel of @xmath1243 is generated by spin - maps @xmath1244 , where @xmath114 and @xmath662 are simple , nonseparating curves which bound an annulus on @xmath1245 containing the distinguished point @xmath1234 .",
    "the composition @xmath1246 is an epimorphism from the group @xmath14 onto the group @xmath1247 and its kernel is generated by @xmath1242 and by the spin maps @xmath1244 , where @xmath114 and @xmath662 are simple , nonseparating curves on @xmath0 which bound an annulus with a hole bounded by @xmath355 .",
    "clearly all such annuli are equivalent by a homeomorphism of @xmath0 , hence all spin maps are conjugate in @xmath412 .",
    "it suffices to consider one spin map @xmath1248 , where @xmath59 and @xmath1249 are curves on figure [ spin maps ] .",
    "@xmath1250 is equal to the element @xmath58 in the relation ( m4 ) .",
    "let @xmath1251 .",
    "it is easy to check , drawing pictures , that @xmath1252 .",
    "therefore , by lemma [ conjugation ] , relation ( m4 ) is equivalent , modulo relations in @xmath412 , to @xmath1253 . by the above argument",
    "@xmath1231 has a presentation with relations ( m1 )  ( m4 ) and relation @xmath1254 .",

    "each element of @xmath412 represents an element in @xmath1261 which we denote by the same symbol .    from now on ,",
    "till the end of this section , symbols denote elements in @xmath1261 .",
    "we want to prove that @xmath1254 .",
    "all relations from lemma [ basic relations ] are true in @xmath1261 .",
    "we have @xmath1262 and @xmath58 commutes with every @xmath356 and @xmath1263 . by lemma [ basic relations ] ,",
    "( iii ) and ( v ) we have :    @xmath1264@xmath1265,@xmath1266 @xmath1267,@xmath1268,@xmath1269 .",
    "we also see that @xmath1270 and @xmath1271 are spin maps , hence @xmath1272 and @xmath1273 .",

    "now @xmath1280 commutes with @xmath58 , by ( m4 ) , and commutes with @xmath33 and @xmath323 , by ( j ) , hence    @xmath1281@xmath1282 , by ( j ) .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem [ presentation closed ] .",

    "we shall transform it using relations ( m1 ) and ( m2 ) and then we shall conjugate it by @xmath1286 to get the relation ( c ) . since ( m1)=(a ) and ( m2 ) is equivalent to ( b ) in presence of ( m1 ) , it will prove that ( m3 ) is equivalent to ( c ) in presence of ( m1 ) and ( m2 ) .",
    "it follows from ( m1 ) and the definitions that each factor on the right hand side of ( m3 ) commutes with @xmath1287 , therefore @xmath548 also commutes with @xmath1287 .",
    "recall the relations ( [ a2 ] ) , ( [ ti , tj ] ) and ( [ a14 ] ) from section 4 , which follow from the relations ( m1 ) and ( m2 ) .",

    "in order to compare theorems 3 and @xmath55 we need another set of generators .",
    "let us call the curves @xmath1309  _ the generating curves_. let @xmath61 be the curve shown on figure [ general surface ] and let @xmath1310 be a curve which intersects @xmath1311 once and intersects @xmath61 once and is disjoint from the other",
    "_ generating curves_. then the curves @xmath1312 have the same intersection pattern as the _ generating curves _ and the curve @xmath61 plays the same role with respect to these curves as the curve @xmath59 with respect to the _ generating curves_. let @xmath1313 and @xmath233 be twists along the curves @xmath61 and @xmath1310 respectively .",
    "then , by theorem 1 , we have a new presentation of @xmath412 with generators @xmath1314 and with defining relations ( m1@xmath1315 , ( m2@xmath1315 , ( m3@xmath1315 corresponding to ( m1 ) , ( m2 ) , ( m3 ) .",
    "it is a presentation of the same group and therefore , when we express @xmath233 in terms of the generators from theorem 1 , it is equivalent to the presentation ( ( m1 ) , ( m2 ) , ( m3 ) ) and to the presentation ( ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) ) . by theorem 3",
    "the group @xmath1316 has a presentation with relations ( m1@xmath1315 , ( m2@xmath1315 , ( m3@xmath1315 and one more relation      here @xmath1313 is some product of generators which represents the dehn twist of @xmath26 along the curve @xmath61 .",
