    "it is well known that under mild conditions @xmath12 and @xmath13 are uniformly strongly consistent and asymptotically normal estimators of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively @xcite .    by far the most common measure of fit in kernel smoothing is the mean integrated squared error ( mise ) .",
    "other less commonly applied criteria include the @xmath14 norm @xcite , the kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence @xcite , and the hellinger distance @xcite .",
    "one consequence of using the curve - fitting framework to evaluate the quality of the estimates and is that in general the bandwidths optimal for kde and kdfe differ ( intuitively , the d.f .",

    "for example , the bandwidths optimal in the mise sense for @xmath12 and @xmath13 are asymptotically of order @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the first two equalities underpin the quasi- ( or pseudo- ) maximum likelihood @xcite and the maximum spacings estimators @xcite .",
    "the third equality in can be used to motivate testing the goodness of fit or evaluation of density forecasts by checking the uniformity of pits @xcite , although such tests are usually motivated by the fact that pits are uniform if @xmath41 @xcite , thus bypassing the maximum entropy interpretation .",

    "the imaxent estimators will then also be consistent for @xmath48 .",
    "when @xmath49 the pseudo - true values of imaxent estimators will generally differ from the maximiser of the entropy of @xmath31 . however , if the model provides a close approximation to the true distribution , one can expect all such pseudo - true values to be similar .    while the imaxent estimators for parametric models are not further pursued here",

    "then a bandwidth which results in the joint distribution of the leave - one - out estimates being close to uniform over their support can be seen as the bandwidth indirectly maximising the shannon entropy of pits .",
