    "luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ( u)lirgs ) represent a truly remarkable class of objects . with far - infrared luminosities of @xmath5",
    ", these galaxies emit a significant fraction of their total bolometric luminosity at infrared wavelengths ( soifer et al .",
    "1986 ; sanders 1989 ) . although these rapidly evolving and often merging objects are frequently hosts of both powerful starbursts and agn ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , there is increasing observational evidence to suggest that most of this ir and fir emission is produced by extreme star formation events ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 , downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "observations suggest that the evolutionary track followed by ulirgs once their molecular gas supply is exhausted will likely be towards field elliptical / lenticular galaxies of moderate mass ( genzel et al .",
    "2001 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) , rather than towards hosts of optically bright qsos as originaly suggested by sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) .",
    "several studies of the molecular gas have been made since its ubiquitous presence in ( u)lirgs was first established ( tinney et al .",
    "1990 ; sanders , scoville & soifer 1991 ; solomon et al .  1997 ; see sanders 1997 for a review ) .",
    "intense far - uv radiation and strong tidal fields in these merging / starburst objects are likely to be responsible for the differing physical properties of the molecular gas relative to those prevailing in lower - power starbursts ( aalto et al .  1991 , 1995 ; casoli , dupraz & combes 1991 ) , while interferometer maps reveal compact ( @xmath6kpc )",
    "co - emitting regions ( bryant 1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ; bryant & scoville 1998 ) . a large fraction of the total molecular gas mass in these objects is in a warm , dense gas phase ( solomon , radford , & downes 1990 ; solomon , downes , & radford 1992a ) , and the same type of gas may be also responsible for the bright high - excitation co lines detected in several dust - enshrouded and more luminous starbursts and qsos ( @xmath7 ) at high redshifts over the last decade ( see solomon & vanden bout 2005 for a review ) .",
    "detections of high - excitation co transitions such as j=43 and j=65 in local galaxies were first made in the early 1990s ( e.g. , harris et al .",
    "1991 , wild et al .",
    "1992 , gsten et al .",
    "poor atmospheric transmission under all but the very best observing conditions has prevented systematic surveys of these transitions in galaxies other than in local , compact ( @xmath8 pc ) and low luminosity ( @xmath9 ) starbursts such as m82 ( white et al .",
    "1994 ; mao et al .",
    "2000 , wild et al .",
    "1993 , ward et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the centers of a few nearby spirals ( nieten et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the lack of large - format array receivers at these frequencies makes imaging of high excitation co transitions difficult except with special instrumentation ( fixsen , bennett , & mather 1999 ; kim et al .",
    "this is unfortunate since , when combined with lower - j co and @xmath10co transitions , co j=43 , j=65 line emission with @xmath11 k , @xmath12 and critical densities of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , can provide excellent diagnostics of the excitation conditions of the molecular gas .    to fill this gap , we initiated a multi - transition co , @xmath0co and hcn survey of @xmath15 lirgs with which to undertake a detailed study of their molecular gas component , with particular emphasis on the warm and dense phase fueling their prodigious star formation rates . in this paper",
    "we report on the principal result of the ulirg / qso mrk231 , the first galaxy in our sample for which multi - transition observations have been completed .",
    "we present an assesssment of the physical conditions of its molecular gas reservoir based on an lvg analysis , which we then use to compute the cooling budget of the reservoir and to construct co and hcn spectral line energy distributions ( hereafter sleds ) .",
    "we compare the mrk231 sleds to the typically poorly constrained sleds of high - z starbursts , and use them to assess the capabilities of both future cm / mm interferometers and esa s high frequency spaceborne observatory herschel in detecting these important line diagnostics in starbursts in the distant universe . throughout this work",
    "we assume a flat @xmath16-dominated cosmology with @xmath17kms@xmath18mpc@xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the 15-meter james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea in hawaii was used for observations of the co j=65 , co j=43 , co j=32 and hcn j=43 transitions in the archetypal ulirg / qso mrk231 .",
    "these observations are part of our large and ongoing co , @xmath0co and hcn line survey of 30 lirgs ( @xmath20 ) which is being undertaken using the jcmt and the iram 30-m telescope ( see papadopoulos et al .",
    "2007 for a description ) .",
    "receiver w at d - band ( 620 - 710ghz ) was used on february 20 , 2005 in ssb mode to observe the co j=65 line ( @xmath21 ) under excellent atmospheric conditions ( @xmath22 ) , with typical system temperatures of @xmath23 ( including atmospheric absorption ) . the digital autocorrelation spectrometer ( das )",
    "was deployed in wideband - mode ( 1.8ghz ) , with a resulting instantaneous bandwidth of @xmath24 which was more than sufficient to cover the full width of the co line ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "rapid beam switching with a chop frequency of 1 - 2hz and a beam throw of 60@xmath26 ( in az ) yielded flat baselines after a total of 2 hours of integration ( on+off ) . pointing at d - band",
    "is complicated by the paucity of suitably bright , compact pointing sources .",
    "differential pointing was therefore employed using a combination of b - band ( 330 - 360ghz , b3 receiver ) and d - band measurements , with the relative pointing offsets of the two different receivers determined prior to the observing run .",
    "initial pointing and focus checks were made using jupiter which , at the time of the observations , had a semi - diameter of @xmath27  we note that pointing using sources that are extended relative to the primary beam has been shown to work well at these high frequencies . pointing checks with b3 were made prior to , and during our observations , and were applied to the telescope pointing model for d - band , resulting in a typical rms scatter in the latter of @xmath28 .",
    "the co j=43 line ( @xmath29 ) was observed with receiver w tuned to ssb mode in c - band ( 430 - 510ghz ) on april 23 2005 .",
    "dry conditions ( @xmath30 ) yielded typical system temperatures of @xmath31 .",
    "a das bandwidth of 920mhz ( @xmath32 ) was used , which was sufficient to cover the line with ample margin for baseline subtraction .",
    "beam switching at 1 - 2hz with a beam throw of 30@xmath26 ( az ) produced excellent flat baselines after a total of 40 mins ( on+off ) of observations .",
    "pointing checks were again differential , with an rms uncertainty of @xmath33 .",
    "estimates of the aperture efficiencies at both frequencies were made from repeated observations of mars , resulting in a value of @xmath34 ( for @xmath35 ) which is consistent within @xmath36 with values reported by others for the same observing period .",
    "the scarcity of @xmath37 measurements at 691ghz did not allow such comparisons and so we adopted the mean value , @xmath38 , of our two measurements ( @xmath39 from a mars beam map ) .",
    "this value has a larger uncertainty  of around 30%  due to larger calibration uncertainties as well as the effects of thermal distortions / mechanical deformations of the dish affecting high - frequency observations even on prime sub - mm telescopes such as the jcmt .",
    "the co j=32 ( 345.7960 ghz ) and hcn j=43 ( 354.5054 ghz ) observations were made on july 10th 1999 ( co ) and january 26th 2005 , january 17th 2006 ( hcn ) , with receiver b3 tuned in ssb mode with effective system temperatures of @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "a das configuration with @xmath42ghz bandwidth was used for co j=32 ( @xmath43 ) , whilst a narrower - band 920mhz / dual - channel mode was used for hcn j=43 ( @xmath44 ) for increased sensitivity .",
    "beam switching at 1 hz and a chop throw of 60@xmath26  ( az ) was employed in both cases , giving flat baselines for total integration times of 20min ( co ) and 4 hours ( hcn ) .",
    "a number of aperture efficiency measurements were made using mars , yielding @xmath45 ( for @xmath46 ) .",
    "frequent pointing checks were made by observing strong sources in both continuum and spectral line mode , yielding an rms uncertainty of @xmath33 for the pointing model residuals .",
    "finally , observations of strong spectral line standards such as irc10216 , omc1 , w75n and w3(oh ) were used to verify the amplitude calibration , to estimate calibration uncertainties ( @xmath47 ) , and to monitor the overall performance of the  telescope .",
    "all data were reduced using the jcmt spectral line reduction package specx .",
    "zero - order baselines were removed and spectra inspected individually , prior to being co - added to produce the final spectra shown in figs .  1 and 2 , where an excellent line profile agreement , with a @xmath48 , is evident for all the transitions observed .",
    "the velocity - integrated line flux densities were estimated from these spectra using    @xmath49    where the term @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52=source diameter , accounts for the geometric coupling of the gaussian component of the beam with a finite - sized , disk - like source .",
    "for mrk231 we have used a value of @xmath53 ( likely to be even smaller for the high - j co transitions and the hcn emission ) , obtained from interferometric observations of co j=10 ( downes & solomon 1998 ) , yielding an upper limit of @xmath54 in the case of the co j=65 line . the line fluxes obtained from observations presented in this paper , those extracted from observations reported in the literature and brightness temperature line ratios are listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "it can be seen from table 1 that , with the exception of a single measurement by krgel et al . , all co j=10 single dish measurements are in good agreement with oneanother , but that they are higher than those obtained using interferometers ( which are , in turn , good agreement among themselves ) . the difference between the average of all the single dish data @xmath55 and that of the two interferometric measurements @xmath56 is significant at a @xmath57 level .",
    "if confirmed at a higher significance level , this discrepancy may result from the presence of a colder and more extended gas phase that is missed in typical interferometer maps because of its low brightness ( and the resulting low s / n per beam ) , rather than the lack of short baselines .",
    "the dust content of such a gas phase , present even in some luminous starburst / qsos , has been detected via its sub - mm continuum emission ( e.g. papadopoulos & seaquist 1999a ) , where dust with @xmath58 , concomitant with hi and low surface brightness co j=10 emission has been found .",
    "sub - mm continuum imaging and multi - transition co observations of lirgs have shown that unless one has sufficient angular resolution to separate the warm , star - forming gas and dust from the typically , more extended non star - forming phase , the _ global _ dust continuum and co line ratios will be dominated by the warm gas ( e.g. , papadopoulos & allen 2000 ) . in this paper",
    "we assume that such an extended phase of non star - forming molecular gas is not present in mrk231 .",
    "the combination of the large number of co and hcn line detections for the ulirg / qso mrk231 ( table  2 ) and the upper limit on the @xmath59 ( j=21 ) line ratio of @xmath60 ( glenn & hunter 2001 ) offers an excellent opportunity to place strong constraints on the state of its molecular gas , with emphasis on the dense gas phase . to do this",
    ", we used a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) code , based on work by richardson 1985 , that searches a large grid of @xmath61 values , where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 $ ] , @xmath64 : cloud velocity gradient , x : the molecule used ) and locates the @xmath65 ^ 2 $ ] minima , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are observed and model line ratios , and @xmath68 is the measurement uncertainty .",
    "a parameter space of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and an @xmath71 range corresponding to @xmath72 ( for the standard co and hcn abundances ) was searched , where    @xmath73    ( e.g. papadopoulos & seaquist 1999b ; goldsmith 2001 ) indicates whether a virialized gas phase ( @xmath74 within factors of 2 - 3 ) , or a non - virialized one ( @xmath75 ) is responsible for the molecular line emission ( @xmath76 depending on the assumed cloud density profile , bryant & scoville 1996 ) .",
    "strictly speaking , values of @xmath77 are not physical ( i.e. gas motions can not be slower than those dictated by self - gravity ) , however they can be used to indicate the possibility of enhanced molecular abundances instead ( so that the revised @xmath78 can reach at least @xmath79 ) .",
    "additional constraints to the modelling are provided from estimates of the dust temperature  @xmath80 ( glenn & hunter 2001 ; gao & solomon 2004a )  and the assumption that photoelectric and/or turbulent gas heating ( and its cooling via atomic / molecular lines rather than continuum emission ) results in @xmath81 ( e.g. wilson et al .",
    "1982 ; tielens & hollenbach 1999 ) . the chosen range for @xmath82",
    "therefore encompasses that expected for the molecular gas in mrk231 , with the temperature of c@xmath83-cooled , cold neutral medium hi gas setting its upper  limit .",
    "the results of single - phase modeling make it clear that _ the co j=43 and j=65 trace a different gas phase from that traced by the j=10 , 21 , 32 transitions , _",
    "i.e. we find no region of the @xmath84 parameter space compatible with both the observed values of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , _ and _ the high @xmath88 ratio ( @xmath89 over the entire parameter space ) .",
    "the lvg solutions derived solely from @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath87 converge to @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( best fit when @xmath94=100 $ ] , and for @xmath95 ; @xmath96 ) , and @xmath97 ( for @xmath98\\sim 10^{-4}$ ] ) .",
    "this warm , non - virialised , gas phase with @xmath99 is typically found in ulirgs , a possible result of strongly evolving dynamical and far - uv - intense environments ( aalto et al .",
    "1995 ) , but has expected ratios of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which are @xmath102 ( for @xmath103 ) to @xmath104 ( for @xmath105 ) times lower than those observed in mrk231 . this result is illustrated in fig .  3 , where we show the observed co line luminosities ( in solar units ) together with the values expected from the best - fitting lvg model derived from the lowest three co lines and the @xmath106co @xmath107 line only .",
    "the fluxes of the high-@xmath108 lines far exceed the values predicted from this model , demonstrating the presence of a distinct gas component , the emission from which dominates the observed line fluxes .",
    "the presence of a massive gas phase in mrk231 that is much denser than that dominating the low - j co line emission can be inferred from its luminous hcn j=10 line which makes this galaxy stand out even amongst ulirgs as the one with the highest hcn / co j=10 luminosity ratio ( @xmath109 , solomon et al .",
    "the detection of hcn j=43 ( @xmath110 ) certainly corroborates this , however a single line is not sufficient to point uniquely to the presence of gas with @xmath111 .",
    "much lower densities are still possible if sub - thermal excitation and/or radiative trapping ( due to their considerable optical depths ) were to be significant . intensity ratios of widely - spaced hcn transitions are excellent probes of the dense star - forming gas , and provide the key to differentiating between different excitation processes , revealing a considerable range of properties even in starbursts with similar fir and low - j co luminosities ( jackson et al .",
    "1995 ; paglione , jackson , & ishizuki 1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath112 ratio measured in mrk  231 indicates _ a sub - thermally excited hcn j=43 line _ which is well below that of arp220 ( @xmath113 ; greve et al .",
    "2006 ) , another archetypal ulirg often used as a typical template for high - z starbursts . the physical conditions compatible with the dense - gas - dominated @xmath112 and hcn(10)/co(65 ) ( @xmath114 ) brightness temperature ratios were explored with our lvg code using hcn collisional rates for the first 11 levels taken from the leiden atomic and molecular database lamda .",
    "the value of @xmath115 helps discriminate over the considerable range of conditions compatible solely with @xmath112 , while two additional constraints can be set by a ) assuming that the hcn emission emanates from virialized gas `` cells '' ( @xmath116 ; as is the case for the dense star - forming gas in the galaxy ) , and b ) by stipulating that @xmath117 .",
    "the best solution ranges found are those with @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( see table 3 ) , though the latter satisfies @xmath74 only for a @xmath120 times higher @xmath121 $ ] abundance than that considered typical for the milky way . in starburst environments values of @xmath119 may be possible because of a higher ionization fraction of the molecular gas ( lepp & dalgarno 1996 ) , or higher c , c@xmath83 abundances ( which favor hcn production , boger & sternberg 2005 ) deeper inside molecular clouds caused by a more vigorous turbulent diffusion of their atom - rich outer layers inwards .",
    "the mass of the hcn - emitting gas phase can be estimated in a manner similar to that used to determine the total molecular gas mass ( using the @xmath122co j=10 line ) , since the same arguments about line emission from an ensemble of self - gravitating , non - shadowing ( in space or velocity ) , clouds apply . following gao & solomon ( 2004a ) ,    @xmath123    where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the area / velocity - averaged brightness temperature and the line luminosity of an optically thick hcn j=10 line ( the case for all solutions in table  3 ) . for the two sets of conditions that best fit the dense gas line ratios",
    ", the coefficient in the equation above becomes @xmath126 ( for @xmath127 ) and @xmath128 ( for @xmath129 ) .",
    "the hcn j=10 luminosity of mrk231 is estimated using    @xmath130    where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the total linewidth and the area of the emitting source ( where in this case x = hcn(10 ) ) respectively . substituting and converting to astrophysically useful units yields    @xmath133    for @xmath134(z=0.042)=183.4mpc and @xmath135 ( hcn j=10 ) the hcn j=10 velocity - integrated flux density ( table  2 ) yields @xmath136 .",
    "for the range of @xmath137 values derived previously , this corresponds to @xmath138 , while the total h@xmath3 gas mass estimated from the co j=10 line luminosity of @xmath139 ( @xmath140 , and the co j=10 flux in table  2 ) , and a standard galactic conversion factor of @xmath141 , is @xmath142 .",
    "thus , _ at least @xmath143 and maybe all of the molecular gas mass in the ulirg / qso mrk231 is dense ( @xmath144 ) _ , quite unlike the state of the _ bulk _ of the molecular gas in our galaxy and in low intensity starbursts where @xmath145 ( e.g. paglione et al .",
    "1997 ; weiss , walter , & scoville 2005 ) .",
    "the dynamical mass within a radius of @xmath146 , estimated from high - resolution co images , is @xmath147 ( downes & solomon 1998 , corrected for the adopted cosmology ) .",
    "thus , either all that mass is molecular gas , or @xmath148 is overestimated by adopting an @xmath149 factor .",
    "extensive studies of ulirgs suggest the latter because in these extreme systems the molecular gas phase encompasses significant amounts of non - gaseous mass ( i.e. stars ) and thus one of the main assumptions underlying a standard galactic @xmath150 factor ( that of an ensemble of self - gravitating molecular clouds ) breaks down .",
    "these studies find @xmath151 ( solomon 1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ) , which for mrk231 yields @xmath152 , making it @xmath153 times smaller than @xmath154 estimated from equation  3 .",
    "this is clearly impossible , and argues for a revision also of the @xmath155 values derived from equation 3 .",
    "such a revision can be understood in much the same terms underlying that of the @xmath156 factor , since the dense gas phase seems responsible for both hcn and most of the co j=10 line emission .",
    "it must be noted that this is not done for many hcn - deduced dense gas masses in ulirgs reported in the literature ( e.g. solomon et al .",
    "1992a ) and _ thus these could be systematically overestimated by a factor of  @xmath1575 . _    interestingly , by adopting the same correction factor of @xmath158 for @xmath137 yields @xmath159 for mrk231 which , for its starburst - related ir luminosity of @xmath160 ( downes & solomon 1998 ) and @xmath161 ( sanders et al .",
    "2003 ) , raises the star formation efficiency to @xmath162 , effectively bracketing the maximum value of @xmath163 expected from o , b , star radiation - feedback effects on the accreted dust / gas in star - forming gmcs ( scoville 2004 ) .",
    "these may therefore be the hallmark features of the star - forming molecular gas phase in galaxies  _ densities of @xmath164 , and star formation efficiencies of @xmath165 _  which in mrk231 amounts to most of its molecular gas mass .",
    "unlike the hcn j=10 , 43 , and co j=65 line emission which are dominated by the dense gas , the lower - j co lines have contributions also from a diffuse phase .",
    "the observed co ( 65)/(10 ) line ratio can then be expressed as    @xmath166    where @xmath167 expresses the contribution of emission from the dense phase ( b ) to that from a diffuse and more extended phase ( a ) , with @xmath168 being their relative geometric filling factor , and @xmath169 their co j=10 brightness temperatures ( all quantities are velocity / area averages ) .",
    "all other co line ratios where both phases contribute to both transitions can be expressed as    @xmath170    typically we find @xmath171 which , along with the known range of @xmath172 values ( obtained from the dense gas properties outlined in section 3.1 ) , allows the subtraction of the dense phase contribution from the observed ratios and the estimate of the @xmath173 values .",
    "these and the @xmath60 ratio ( which we assume to be dominated by the diffuse phase ) are then used as inputs into our lvg code .",
    "this in turn yields @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) for the diffuse phase ( a ) , with still lower densities of @xmath176 but @xmath177 also possible . in all cases",
    "@xmath178 ( reaching as high as @xmath15 ) , which suggests the presence of highly unbound gas whose large @xmath64 values and high @xmath179 are responsible for its modest co j=10 optical depths ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "this phase could be confined around individual gmcs `` enveloping '' their much denser self - gravitating regions , or could be distributed over very different scales .",
    "interferometric co line imaging reveals a disk distribution with much of the lower - density molecular gas in the outer regions ( downes & solomon 1998 ) . in either case , the diffuse non self - gravitating gas phase is a minor contributor to the total molecular gas mass of mrk231 .",
    "the temperature of the molecular gas in a galaxy is determined by the equilibrium between heating and cooling processes .",
    "gas heating is dominated by the photoelectric effect on dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , as discussed by e.g. , wolfire et al .",
    "cooling proceeds through line radiation which , in normal galaxies , is dominated by the [ cii ] @xmath181 line ( e.g. , wolfire et al .",
    "1995 , 2003 ; kaufman et al .",
    "1999 ) , which can carry up to @xmath182% of the total far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity of a galaxy ( e.g. , stacey et al .  1991",
    "; malhotra et al .  1997 ; leech et al .",
    "1999 ; pierini et al .  1999 ; negishi et al .",
    "2001 ) . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the heating and cooling rates are balanced : increased heating , such as that resulting from enhanced star formation will be compensated by increased cooling .",
    "this has been used to estimate star formation rates in nearby galaxies using the observed [ cii ] line luminosity ( e.g. , crawford et al .",
    "1985 ; stacey et al .  1991 ; boselli et al .  2002 ) .",
    "measurements obtained with the long wavelength spectrograph ( lws ) on the infrared space observatory ( iso ) have shown that the [ cii]/fir flux ratio decreases in galaxies of very high fir luminosity , i.e. , the increase in [ cii ] line luminosity is no longer proportional to the fir luminosity .",
    "this effect was first discovered in deep iso measurements of a small sample of nearby ulirgs ( luhman et al .",
    "1998 ) , where the observed [ cii]/fir luminosity ratio was found to be smaller than @xmath183% in some of the most fir - luminous galaxies - a value more than factor of 10 lower than that observed in less luminous galaxies . various explanations for this effect have been proposed , including dust absorption and saturation effects , self - absorption in the [ cii ] line and more subtle explanations related to the detailed physics of dense photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) ( luhman et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the high luminosity of the [ cii ] line suggests that the line should be observable ( redshifted into the submillimeter regime ) out to very high redshifts ( e.g. , loeb 1993 ; stark 1997 ; suginohara et al .",
    "indeed , alma will be able to detect the [ cii ] emission from a milky way - type galaxy out to @xmath184 ( van der werf & israel 1996 ) .",
    "it is therefore imperative to understand the physical conditions determining the strength of the [ cii ] line more fully .",
    "the first attempts to detect this line in the distant universe were carried out by isaak et al .",
    "( 1994 ) on the @xmath185 qso br1202@xmath1860725 , with an upper limit implying a [ cii]/fir ratio lower than in the nearby starburst galaxy m82 . in a deeper integration on this same object , an upper limit on the [ cii ] luminosity was found which is less than 0.06% of the total fir luminosity ( van der werf 1999 ) .",
    "recently , the first detections of [ cii ] at high redshift have been obtained in the @xmath187 qso sdssj1148 + 5251 ( maiolino et al .",
    "2005 ) , and in the @xmath185 qso br1202@xmath1860725 ( iono et al . , 2006 ) where the [ cii ] luminosity is @xmath188% of the total far - infrared luminosity .",
    "all these results are consistent with iso observations of local ulirgs , and suggest that the same physical mechanisms are responsible .",
    "our present results for mrk231 amount to the most complete picture of the molecular gas attained for a local ulirg enabling us to analyze the cooling budget of its molecular medium in detail , and thereby shed light on the [ cii ] problem .",
    "the results are summarized in table  4 where we have used the mean values from our lvg models to calculate luminosities for co lines which have not been observed .",
    "the hcn lines ( not relevant for the cooling budget ) resulting from the same models are presented in table  5 .",
    "the [ cii ] @xmath189 m line luminosity has been derived from the line flux of @xmath190w@xmath191 measured using the iso lws by luhman et al .",
    "the cooling due to the @xmath192 and @xmath193 [ ci ] lines was estimated from a measurement of the latter ( gerin & phillips 2000 ) and by assuming lte ( the [ ci ] energy levels are expected to be fully thermalized for the dense gas phase ) .",
    "the @xmath194 range of the best two lvg solution ranges ( table  3 ) constrains the ci(21)/(10 ) brightness temperature ratio to @xmath195 , for which we adopt the mean value of @xmath79 ( which is actually measured in m82 ; stutzki et al .",
    "we also list the total luminosity @xmath196 in co lines up to @xmath197 for the dense phase only , as well as those the total luminosity @xmath198 in co lines from the diffuse phase , calculated from the difference between observed fluxes and the modeled fluxes from the dense phase .",
    "line strengths are presented in flux units ( @xmath199 in jykms@xmath18 ) , in luminosity units ( @xmath200 in @xmath201 ) , and in @xmath202 luminosities ( in kkms@xmath18pc@xmath203 , estimated using eq .",
    "5 ) ; the last quantity scales directly with the intrinsic brightness temperature of the line , and is thus constant for thermalized optically thick lines originating from the same medium .",
    "table  4 shows the remarkable result that the cooling luminosity for the dense molecular gas in mrk231 considering only co approaches that of the [ cii ] line , with @xmath204 while @xmath205}/l_{\\rm   fir}=1.5\\pm0.2\\cdot10^{-4}$ ] , for @xmath206 in mrk231 ( sanders et al . , 2003 for the cosmology adopted here ) .",
    "the situation is further illustrated in fig .  4 , where we show a bar histogram of the cooling lines of the interstellar gas in mrk231 .",
    "error bars are observational errors for the luminosities based on measured fluxes , and indicate the range allowed by the lvg models for the remaining values . for the latter values we adopted a minimum uncertainty of at least 30% based on the measurement errors of the co @xmath207 and @xmath208 lines .",
    "the error bars thus give a good indication of the expected ranges taking into account uncertainties in both the observations and the lvg modeling .",
    "it is instructive to compare these results to the corresponding results for the milky way , where global co line fluxes have been measured using the cobe data , and converted into luminosities using a model for the spatial distribution of the emission within the solar circle by wright et al .",
    "for the milky way the total co cooling ( relative to fir luminosity ) is @xmath209 , while for [ cii ] @xmath205}/l_{\\rm fir}=2.8\\cdot10^{-3}$ ] , i.e. , the cooling is totally dominated by [ cii ] with neglible co cooling . the importance of the co line cooling is also reflected in the co line ratios : the flux ratio co @xmath210 ( which has been observed both objects ) is 1.5 in the milky way ( wright et al . , 1991 ) , but 5.4 in mrk231 .",
    "we can also compare these results to a recent survey in mid-@xmath108 co lines and the two [ ci ] lines by bayet et al .",
    "( 2006 ) of a small sample of local starburst galaxies . in these objects",
    "the mid-@xmath108 co lines are also found to be much stronger than in the milky way , with cooling by co lines significantly exceeding that from [ ci ] . however , co cooling in these objects is still insignificant compared to [ cii ] , in contrast to the much more extreme results obtained here for mrk231 .",
    "the cooling associated with the diffuse molecular gas ( contributing only to the lowest three co transitions ) of mrk231 is relatively unimportant .",
    "thus it is natural to identify the dense phase with the actively star forming gas , which experiences the strongest heating , and must therefore also cool efficiently . unlike the milky way and lower intensity starbursts in mrk231 this phase contains most of the molecular gas mass , forming stars at what is thought to be a maximum efficiency ( section 3.1 ) , at rates found only in dense star - forming cores in the milky way .    the resulting picture of a dense and dominant ( in terms of mass ) molecular gas phase , emitting strongly in co @xmath207 but with a suppressed [ cii ] line , points towards dense pdrs ( e.g. , kaufman et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "in such pdrs , the high density leads to a high formation rate for co ( proportional to @xmath211 ) , while the co photodissociation rate is less strongly enhanced ( proportional to @xmath212 ) . as a result , the ionized carbon layer is thin , leading to a suppressed [ cii ] line .",
    "in addition , the transition from ionized and atomic carbon to co now takes place closer to the source of heating , resulting in a large column density of warm molecular gas with strong emission in the mid-@xmath108 co lines .",
    "generalizing to ulirgs as a population , our mrk231 result suggests that _ the suppressed _ [ cii ] _ cooling in ulirgs is a result of high densities for most of their molecular gas , bathed in strong far - uv radiation fields , _ quite unlike lower intensity starburst or quiescent galaxies where much more modest amounts of molecular gas reside in such a high density phase .",
    "our explanation predicts strong emission in co lines up to @xmath197 in ulirgs . while such high - j transitions are not observable from the ground , they will be accesible with hifi onboard the herschel satellite .",
    "observations of high excitation co lines from space or the ground , as well as careful estimates of the fraction of molecular gas mass with @xmath213@xmath214 in local ulirgs using hcn transitions , will provide a critical test of the hypothesis that dense pdrs lie at the heart of the [ cii ] cooling problem in ulirgs .",
    "the wealth of molecular line and dust continuum data used to constrain the state of molecular gas in mrk231 and assign most of its mass to a dense phase is rarely available for objects in the distant universe .",
    "typically , two high-@xmath108 co lines are detected ( solomon et al .",
    "1992b ; solomon & vanden bout 2005 and references therein ) , with a similar sparsity of dust continuum measurements .",
    "the few frequencies observed ( usually at the rayleigh - jeans part of a sed ) provide poor estimates of @xmath215 , which in turn provides little constraint on the range of @xmath194 . in most cases ,",
    "the often ( but not always ) large co line ratios of high-@xmath108 lines measured in high redshift objects are interpreted in terms of a warm phase , yet infact they trace a wider range of physical conditions .",
    "this degeneracy can be easily demonstrated by setting the high @xmath216 ratio measured in mrk231 as the only constraint available .",
    "it can then be seen ( table  6 ) that besides the typical warm gas phase with moderate optical depths , gas as cold as @xmath217 but @xmath218 times more dense also reproduces the high @xmath216 ratio that we have observed .",
    "in such a phase the large co line optical depths , and the resulting radiative trapping , thermalize transitions up to high @xmath108 levels so that    @xmath219    ( @xmath220 ) , which for e.g. @xmath221 yields @xmath222 ( the observed value ) .    the degeneracies alluded to above reflect real conditions found in gmcs : warm , dense gas associated with star formation , and dense - but - cold gas in regions with no such significant activity . in ulirgs a massive , dense but cold phase is unlikely but not impossible during the rapid dynamic evolution expected for mergers ( e.g. , aalto 2005 ) .",
    "observing at least one @xmath0co transition is pivotal to discriminating between cold dense gas with an optically thick co j=10 line and a less dense warmer phase where @xmath223 .",
    "indeed , the cold / dense solutions in table 6 correspond to @xmath224 j=10 intensity ratios of @xmath225 , much lower than those even in the coldest gmcs ( @xmath226 ) .",
    "interestingly , setting @xmath227 as a constraint selects the conditions with @xmath228 ( table 6 ) , and thus may also be useful in `` breaking '' such degeneracies , though it will always depend on the assumed abundances .",
    "high resolution imaging of molecular lines and their relative strengths with the next generation of mm / sub - mm arrays holds the key to unobscured views of deeply dust - enshrouded star forming regions in galaxies , their dynamical masses , and the molecular gas fueling the embedded star formation .",
    "this is apparent now that co - bright h@xmath3 gas has been detected out to @xmath229 ( walter et al .",
    "2003 ) , and distant dust - enshrouded optically faint starbursts , responsible for building large fractions of the stellar mass at present epochs , have been discovered ( e.g. smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ) .",
    "the need for local molecular line sleds for the bulk of the molecular gas in galaxies ( and not just for their starburst sub - regions ) is underlined by the fact that currently there are more detections of co j=43 or higher - j lines in high redshift rather than local starbursts ( e.g. solomon & vanden bout  2005 ) .",
    "the compact distribution of the co , hcn emission in local ulirgs and their large ir and molecular line luminosities makes them ideal objects for establishing such sleds ",
    "single pointings encompass all the h@xmath3 distribution  a situation mirrored in high - z galaxies .",
    "the extreme - starburst / qso present in mrk231 makes this galaxy in particular an often- used benchmark for similar high - z systems",
    "( e.g. wagg et al .",
    "we use the constraints on its dense gas properties to derive the expected strengths of the unobserved co and hcn transitions . the resulting co and hcn sleds",
    "can then be used to assess the capabilities of the next generation cm ( evla , ska ) and mm / sub - mm ( alma ) arrays , as well as the spaceborne herschel observatory in detecting star - forming molecular gas throughout the universe ( e.g. van der werf & israel 1996 ) .",
    "the line fluxes , calculated for a range of redshifts , are presented in fig .  5 , where we also show the analogous values for the milky way , with luminosites again from the cobe data ( wright et al . , 1991",
    ") for all lines except co @xmath230 .",
    "the luminosity of the latter line in the milky way was estimated using the co @xmath107 luminosity from wright et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and the co @xmath231 line ratio in the inner @xmath232 of the milky way as measured by cobe , which is within the errors equal to the global line ratio over the inner galaxy ( fixsen , bennett , & mather , 1999 ) . the milky way and",
    "mrk231 bracket the two extremes of quiescent and starburst galaxies .",
    "a luminosity of @xmath233 ( wright et al . , 1991 ) makes the milky way detectable with alma out @xmath234 , using co @xmath235 in the @xmath236ghz band .",
    "higher co lines will not be detectable however , though redshifted [ cii ] will be observable with alma out to @xmath237 with significant integration time . in the case of a mrk231-like object ,",
    "the situation is quite different , with transitions up to co @xmath238 detectable with alma out to @xmath239 .",
    "the two [ ci ] lines can be detected out to @xmath240 , and the [ cii ] line will be readily detectable at @xmath237 .",
    "the high - density tracing hcn lines will typically be detectable only out to @xmath241 , where the @xmath242ghz band of alma will be the most suitable frequency range .",
    "it is instructive to investigate how existing detections of co lines at high redshift fit on the mrk231 template .",
    "we use the comprehensive compilation by solomon & vanden bout ( 2005 ; their appendix  2 ) of all detections of ( sub)millimeter lines from high-@xmath243 galaxies to 2005 , supplemented with more recent data by riechers et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in fig .",
    "6 we plot again the co cooling budget of mrk231 but now overlay the observed line luminosities of all high-@xmath243 objects with at least two detected co lines ( one of them being co @xmath235 or @xmath107 ) .",
    "ideally all fluxes should be scaled relative to one common line , but unfortunately there is no line which is detected in all ( or even most ) objects .",
    "however , almost all high-@xmath243 objects with co detections have either the @xmath235 or the @xmath107 line detected ( but , remarkably , so far never both ) .",
    "we therefore scale the observed line fluxes to either the co @xmath235 or the co @xmath107 luminosity of mrk231 and show the results in fig .",
    "inspection of this figure reveals a considerable range in @xmath244 line ratios , and it is clear that interpolation to a fictitious @xmath235 value would have introduced significant uncertainties .",
    "therefore we prefer to normalize to either the @xmath235 or the @xmath107 line , which , although blurring the comparison somewhat , has the advantage of being based on measurements rather than an uncertain interpolation . physically , this procedure is acceptable since these lines have similar contributions from the dense gas component ( 70% for the @xmath245 line , 80% for the @xmath246 line ) in our mrk231 fiducial model .",
    "figure 6 shows that mrk231 is a reasonable template for most high-@xmath243 objects that have been detected in co , with line ratios within a factor of two from those of mrk231 up to about @xmath207 .",
    "this does not imply that _ all _ high-@xmath243 objects would have similar line ratios : there is clearly a selection effect in the sense that high-@xmath243 objects are followed up with low-@xmath108 co observations only after having being detected via their luminous high-@xmath108 line emission . with this caveat in mind",
    ", mrk231 appears to be a useful template for high-@xmath243 galaxies detected in co to - date .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is the case also for its dust continuum emission ( see e.g. , fig .  2 of blain et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "two notable outliers in fig .",
    "6 are hr10 and apm08279 + 5255 .",
    "hr10 is an extremely red object at a modest redshift of @xmath247 which , while a ulirg ( @xmath248 ) , has line ratios indicative of low excitation conditions more similar to the milky way than to mrk231 ( papadopoulos & ivison , 2002 ) . _",
    "detections and imaging of such low excitation objects beyond @xmath249 ( even with such large @xmath250 ) will be difficult even with alma_. at the other extreme , apm08279 + 5255 shows unusually high excitation , with co line luminosities rising all the way up to at least @xmath197 : gas at high gas densities is indicated by the detection of luminous hcn @xmath251 by wagg et al .",
    "while these authors can fit their data with a single gas phase of @xmath252@xmath214 , this object is strongly lensed ( lewis et al . , 2002 ) , and so it is likely that the observed fluxes are dominated by a selectively amplified region of high - density molecular gas .",
    "another indication of a singularly different molecular line excitation of this distant starburst / qso is its hcn(54)/co(43 ) luminosity ratio of @xmath253 ( from wagg et al .",
    "2005 and downes et al .",
    "1999 ) , while from the observed co j=43 and the expected hcn j=54 luminosity ( deduced from the best lvg solutions for the dense gas ) the much lower values of @xmath254 are derived for mrk231 .",
    "agreement with ( or deviation from ) the mrk231 sled appears to depend primarily on the mean gas density of the phase dominating the emission .",
    "this is suggested by further inspection of fig .  6 in relation to the hcn line luminosities where available . in irasf10214 + 4724 , vcvj140955.5 + 562827 , and the cloverleaf quasar , hcn j=10 has been detected , but with an hcn(j=10)/co(j=32 ) ratio much lower than in mrk231 , and these galaxies reveal somewhat lower co line excitation than mrk231 as well .",
    "in contrast , the hcn(j=21)/co(j=21 ) ratio in sdssj1148 + 5251 is higher than in mrk231 , and this object shows also higher excitation in the co lines .",
    "construction of molecular gas sleds out to the high excitation regimes associated with the star - forming gas for a large number of local lirgs will allow a more thorough examination of such differences , while establishing much - needed benchmarks for the interpretation of the still sparse data at high redshifts .",
    "we report on the detections of the co j=65 , j=43 transitions of the archetypal nearby ulirg / qso mrk231 .",
    "these first detections of high - excitation co lines in a local extreme starburst , along with hereby reported co j=32 , hcn j=43 detections and co j=10 , 21 , @xmath255co j=21 , hcn j=10 literature data , allow robust constraints to be placed on its molecular gas properties .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the high excitation co j=43 and j=65 lines trace denser ( @xmath256 ) , gas phase different from that dominating the lower three co transitions .",
    "this phase is also responsible for the observed hcn line emission , and contains @xmath257 of the total molecular gas mass in this galaxy , quite unlike quiescent or lower intensity starbursts where only a few percent of the total molecular gas mass reside in such a phase .",
    "this dominant dense gas phase fuels the starburst in mrk231 at almost the maximum expected star forming efficiency of @xmath258 .",
    "this preeminence of dense and relatively warm ( @xmath259 ) gas in mrk231 presents a totally different thermal balance from that found in more quiescent galaxies , with co comparable to [ cii ] emission line cooling .",
    "if confirmed , through observations of other ulirgs , this may provide the explanation of the long - standing issue of their very low [ cii]/ir luminosity ratios namely , bright high - excitation co lines from dense far - uv photon - dominated molecular gas are the major and even dominant coolants with respect to their faint [ cii ] line",
    ". 3 .   since the excitation conditions probed by the mid-@xmath108 co lines and low - excitation atomic and ionic fine - structure lines are very similar , mid-@xmath108 co lines provide an excellent diagnostic complementary to e.g. , pacs on the esa herschel satellite , and proposed future missions such as the japanese spica project",
    ". with alma these diagnostics will be available at unprecedented spatial resolution .",
    "the well - constrained dense molecular gas sled of mrk231 provides a very valuable template for direct comparisons with starburst / qso systems at high redshifts , with the caveat that it may not be representative of the ulirg population as a whole ( e.g. mrk231 , unlike arp220 , has a sub - thermal hcn(43)/(10 ) line ratio ) .",
    "nevertheless it is a template unaffected by the strong differential lensing that may be skewing the intrinsic sleds of several high redshift galaxies towards those of a more compact , highly - excited , star - forming and even agn - related molecular gas phase .",

    "<S> we report on detections of the high - excitation co j=65 , j=43 lines in mrk231 , a prototypical ultra luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) and seyfert  1 qso . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are combined with co j=32 , hcn j=43 ( this work ) , and co j=21 , j=10 , @xmath0co j=21 , hcn j=10 measurements taken from the literature to provide better constraints on the properties of the molecular gas in an extreme starburst / qso in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the co j=43 and j=65 transitions trace a different gas phase from that dominating the lower three co transitions , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is responsible for the luminous hcn emission , and contains most of the h@xmath3 gas mass of this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the total co line cooling emanating from this dense phase is found similar to that of the [ cii ] line at @xmath4 , _ suggesting a very different thermal balance to that seen in lower ir - luminosity galaxies _ , and one likely dominated by dense photon - dominated regions . </S>",
    "<S> our dense `` sampling '' of the co rotational ladder and the hcn lines enables us to produce well - constrained spectral line energy distributions ( sleds ) for the dense molecular gas in mrk231 and compare them to those of high redshift starbursts , many of which have sleds that may be affected by strong lensing . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use our local molecular line excitation template to assess the capabilities of future cm and mm / sub - mm arrays in detecting co and hcn transitions in similar systems throughout the local and distant universe . </S>"
