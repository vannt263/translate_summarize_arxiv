    ", we study the stabilization problem for monomial ( or equivariant ) maps of toric varieties , extending certain results of favre to higher dimensions . a toric variety @xmath6 is defined by a lattice @xmath7 and fan @xmath8 in @xmath9 .",

    "we address the latter problem only in dimension two :    let @xmath8 be a fan in a lattice @xmath9 of rank @xmath34 , let @xmath14 be a monomial map , and let @xmath35 , @xmath36 be the eigenvalues of the associated linear map @xmath15 , labeled so that @xmath37 .",

    "@xmath18 is not necessarily smooth .",
    "the main result in  @xcite also asserts that we can make @xmath2 1-stable on a smooth toric variety by allowing ramified covers , but there is a gap in this argument , see remark  [ r201 ] .    while monomial maps are quite special , they are interesting in their own right .",
    "we refer to the article by hasselblatt and propp  @xcite for more information , and to the paper by bedford and kim  @xcite for the problem  related to stability  of characterizing monomial maps whose degree growth sequence satisfies a linear recursion formula . for nonmonomial maps in higher dimensions , stability or degree growth is only understood in special cases  @xcite .",
    "we note that many of the results in this paper have been obtained independently by jan - li lin  @xcite .",
    "in particular , ( * ? ? ? * thm  5.7  ( a ) ) coincides with our theorem b in section  [ sec : proofb ] .    there is a conjectured relationship between the eigenvalues @xmath46 and the _ dynamical degrees _",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 of @xmath2 ( see  @xcite for a definition of dynamical degrees ) .",
    "namely , the conjecture says that @xmath49 .",
    "see  @xcite for work in this direction . granting this formula , the condition @xmath50 is equivalent to @xmath51 being strictly concave . now",
    "the conjecture does hold in dimension two .",
    "this means that  ( a ) in theorem  c is equivalent to ( a )  @xmath52 and  ( b ) is equivalent to  ( b )  @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "also observe that  ( c ) is satisfied for @xmath55 as soon as @xmath53 .",
    "to prove the theorems above , we translate them into statements about the linear map @xmath11 .",
    "what we ultimately prove is that we can refine the original fan @xmath8 ( by adding cones ) so that the new fan @xmath17 contains a finite collection @xmath56 of invariant cones ( i.e.  @xmath24 maps each cone into itself ) that together attract all one - dimensional cones in @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , for every one - dimensional cone @xmath57 , there exists @xmath58 such that @xmath59 lies in a cone in @xmath56 for @xmath60 and @xmath59 is a one - dimensional cone in @xmath17 for @xmath61 , see corollary  [ invkoner ] .",
    "constructing such a collection of cones is also the strategy by favre  @xcite for proving theorem  c. in fact , the proof of theorem  b is a straightforward adaptation of arguments in  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the dynamics of @xmath15 is easy to understand : under iteration , a typical vector @xmath62 tends to move towards the one - dimensional eigenspace associated to the largest eigenvalue @xmath35 of @xmath24 .",
    "we can therefore find a simplicial cone @xmath63 of maximum dimension which is invariant under @xmath24 ; it will contain an eigenvector @xmath64 corresponding to @xmath35 , in its interior . using this cone",
    "we easily construct a fan for which theorem  b holds .",
    "on the other hand , theorems  a and  a are much more delicate as we have to take into account the original fan @xmath8 . for example , the simple argument for theorem  b outlined above will not work in general , as it is possible that the one - dimensional cone @xmath65 is rational and belongs to @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , there may be one - dimensional rays in @xmath8 that are not attracted to @xmath65 under iteration .",
    "thus we must proceed more systematically , and this is where the argument becomes significantly more involved in higher dimensions .",
    "what we do is to look at the set @xmath66 of all invariant rational subspaces @xmath67 .",
    "this means that @xmath68 and that @xmath69 is dense in @xmath70 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath66 is a finite set that admits a natural tree structure determined by the dynamics . using this tree we inductively construct a collection @xmath71 of invariant rational cones that together attract any lattice point in @xmath9 .",
    "the construction is flexible enough so that the cones in @xmath71 are `` well positioned '' with respect to the original fan @xmath8 . in particular , each cone in @xmath71",
    "is contained in a unique cone in @xmath8 .",
    "this allows us to refine @xmath8 into a fan that contains all cones in @xmath71 .",
    "significant care is called for , however , as the construction is done inductively over a tree , and incorporating a new cone into a given fan will require many cones of the original fan to be subdivided .",
    "the actual construction is therefore more technical than may be expected .    in dimension two",
    ", these difficulties are largely invisible .",
    "they are the reason why we in theorem  a impose stronger conditions on the eigenvalues than favre did in  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to try to weaken the conditions in theorem  a.    the proof of theorem  c is of a quite different nature , and uses the original ideas of favre as well as some methods from classical number theory . indeed , some of the arguments are parallel to the analysis of the continued fractions expansion of quadratic surds  @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sections  [ sec :",
    "toric ] and  [ sec : monmaps ] we discuss toric varieties and monomial mappings .",
    "section  [ sec : dimtwo ] is concerned with the two - dimensional situation , namely the proofs of theorems  c and  c , and examples showing that smooth stabilization is not always possible .",
    "then in sections  [ sec : proofa ] and  [ sec : proofb ] we return to the higher - dimensional case and prove theorems  a ,  a and  b. finally , in section  [ sec : examples ] we illustrate our proof of theorem  a in dimensions two and three and give a counterexample to the statement in theorem  a when the eigenvalues have mixed signs .",
