    "inclusive @xmath8 decays are a precise probe of the underlying @xmath3- to @xmath4-quark transition because hadronisation effects are small and have a simple structure . these effects are suppressed by powers of the heavy - quark mass and given in terms of a small number of non - perturbative parameters . in the heavy - quark limit ,",
    "the hadronic decay rate becomes equal to the partonic decay rate .",
    "the leading corrections are of order @xmath9 and are given in terms of two non - perturbative heavy - quark parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 which are the @xmath12-meson matrix elements of the kinetic and chromo - magnetic operator respectively .",
    "schematically , the decay rate takes the form @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be calculated in perturbation theory : @xmath18 the general structure of the expansion is the same for other observables , such as partial rates or moments of the decay spectrum , but the calculable coefficients @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are different . for the total rate the kinetic corrections have the same coefficient as the leading order , @xmath19 . also for other observables , such as partial rates and moments , the kinetic corrections can be obtained from the leading - power differential rate , but the relations are more complicated and are evaluated to @xmath20 for the first time in this paper .",
    "to turn ( [ eq : rate ] ) into a precision determination of @xmath2 one needs the values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the heavy - quark parameters . since the same parameters enter moments of the decay spectrum , one can determine these parameters by measuring not only the rate , but also a number of moments . to this end , lepton energy moments and hadronic invariant mass and energy moments are measured @xcite . using the results of these measurements ,",
    "several groups have performed fits of the theoretical expressions to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the theoretical expressions that are used in the fit include one - loop corrections to the leading - power coefficients @xmath23 @xcite as well as the @xmath24-part of the two - loop corrections @xcite , while the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the power corrections are known only at the tree level .",
    "in addition to the second - order power corrections proportional to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the fits also include the third - order power corrections , which involve two additional hadronic parameters , @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite ( the fourth order corrections are now available as well @xcite ) .",
    "this technique yields the most precise determination of @xmath2 together with very precise determinations of the heavy - quark masses .",
    "already now , the estimated theoretical uncertainties are somewhat larger than the experimental ones @xcite . in the future",
    "the experimental uncertainty will decrease further : the babar moment measurements which were used in @xcite were published in 2004 and are based on @xmath29 of data @xcite @xcite .",
    "] , and the recently published belle measurements on @xmath30 @xcite , but combined the two experiments have already collected more than @xmath31 of data .",
    "also , based on the convergence of the perturbative series of the rate for @xmath32-decay and based on the size of the two - loop contributions that arise when converting the theoretical expressions between different schemes used in the literature , it has been suggested that the theoretical uncertainties in the results of the moment fits might be underestimated @xcite .",
    "whether the uncertainties are reliable is an important question because the value of @xmath21 extracted from the fit is a crucial ingredient for the determination of @xmath33 from inclusive decays . after imposing the severe cuts necessary to eliminate the charm background",
    ", the prediction for the @xmath34 rate behaves as @xmath35 with @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the value and uncertainty of the extracted @xmath33 are thus strongly correlated with the value and uncertainty of @xmath21 .",
    "it is clearly desirable to increase the precision of the theoretical predictions . to achieve this goal ,",
    "two ingredients are needed : the leading - power moments have to be evaluated to two - loop accuracy , and the coefficients of the power corrections proportional to @xmath10 and @xmath11 need to be evaluated to one loop . in this paper",
    "we take the first and simplest step in this direction by evaluating the coefficient of the kinetic operator to one - loop accuracy .",
    "let us stress that , while it is demanding , also the @xmath37 calculation of the leading - power moments is doable .",
    "a few years ago such a calculation looked prohibitively difficult , but in the meantime the necessary methods to perform it numerically have been developed @xcite .",
    "indeed , the two - loop correction for muon decay @xmath38 , the qed equivalent of @xmath0 , has been evaluated recently using this method @xcite .",
    "we use the same numerical approach for our one - loop calculation , because the size of the expressions involved is such that an analytic calculation does not look feasible .",
    "since the method is gauge invariant ( we perform the calculation without introducing a gluon mass ) , it is also suited for the calculation of the corrections to the coefficient of the chromomagnetic operator .",
    "the kinetic corrections are obtained by expanding the leading - power @xmath20 expressions up to second order in the small residual momentum of the @xmath3-quark inside the @xmath12-meson . to have a check of our results , we perform the calculation in two different ways .",
    "a straightforward and tedious way of obtaining the kinetic corrections is to expand the leading - power feynman diagrams in the residual momentum before performing the loop and phase - space integrations .",
    "the resulting expressions are long and involve terms which are individually strongly infrared divergent .",
    "another complication arises because the expansion produces not only standard phase - space integrals , but also derivatives of such phase - space integrals , which arise from cutting higher powers of propagators .",
    "a much more elegant and efficient way to perform the calculation is to expand the result for the leading - order differential rate in the residual momentum . in this way one obtains results for the moments in terms of integrals over the leading - power rate and its derivative .",
    "in fact , without experimental cuts one obtains simple algebraic relations between the kinetic corrections and the leading - power moments . as a byproduct of our analysis , we obtain the @xmath20 corrections to the leading - power moments and reproduce the numerical results of @xcite .",
    "as the two - loop corrections to the leading - power rate and the one - loop corrections to the @xmath11 terms are not yet available , it is too early to perform a detailed phenomenological analysis .",
    "instead , we present numerical values for a few reference values of the electron energy cut . for the moments which do not vanish , the corrections we calculate turn out to be small , below @xmath39 as long as the cut on the lepton energy is not too strong . for the moments of the partonic invariant mass @xmath40 , on the other hand , which vanish at the tree - level and leading power , the corrections are larger , of order @xmath41 .",
    "we expect the corrections proportional to @xmath11 to be more important than the kinetic corrections . for the tree - level rate",
    ", they are roughly a factor ten larger than the kinetic corrections .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain how the kinetic corrections are calculated using the operator product expansion ( ope ) . in section [ phasespace ]",
    "we give parameterizations for the phase - space and loop integrals which are needed to perform the calculation .",
    "these parameterizations map the integration onto the unit hypercube and are such that infrared divergences appear only in a single variable and can be isolated before performing the numerical integration .",
    "we present our numerical results in section [ results ] . in the same section , we give formulae for the conversion of partonic to hadronic moments .",
    "we also sketch discuss how to convert our results into different schemes , such as the kinetic @xcite , potential - subtracted @xcite , @xmath42 @xcite or the shape - function scheme @xcite .",
    "in this section we briefly explain how we evaluate the @xmath8 decay rate using the ope .",

    "our goal in this section is to outline the necessary steps to obtain the result and to discuss some of the technicalities which are encountered in the course of the one - loop calculation .",

    ", the question arises whether to expand the diagrams before or after the loop integration . in general , either choice is valid as long as one evaluates the loop corrections to the operator product and to the matrix elements of the local operators @xmath71 in the same way . in our case the situation is especially simple : since we perform the matching calculation on - shell , the one - loop corrections to the hqet matrix elements of the operators @xmath71 vanish and the loop integration commutes with the expansion in the residual momentum . to have a check of our results , we evaluate the corrections in both ways .",

    "the calculation will also answer the question whether the currently used theoretical error estimates on the extracted parameters are realistic .",
    "this is of particular importance because the value and uncertainty of @xmath21 is a crucial input in the determination of @xmath33 from the inclusive @xmath247 decay .",
