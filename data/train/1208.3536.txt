    "in soft x - ray spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , a phenomenon called `` soft x - ray excess '' is often observed . characterized by a similar and steep flux upturn towards lower energies , this feature is clearly noticed particularly in weakly - absorbed agns , such as type i seyferts and broad line radio galaxies ( blrg ) . for years ,",
    "the origin of this spectral structure has been unidentified , and many interpretations have been proposed .",
    "its simplest explanation is blackbody radiation from an optically - thick accretion disk .",
    "however , the observed color temperature of the soft excess , typically @xmath0 kev , is too high for such disks around black holes ( bhs ) of @xmath1 in mass , where @xmath2 is the solar mass .

    "below , we follow their c3po method . for this purpose , 0.53 kev ( filled circles ) , 310 kev ( open circles ) , and 1545 kev ( open squares , from hxd - pin ) light curves of the five agns are shown in figure 1 , after subtracting the nxb .",
    "all of the xis fi light curves exhibit more than 10% variations , with apparently tight correlations between the two xis bands . to quantify this behavior , we produced count - count plots ( ccps ) , in which abscissa is the 310 kev band xis fi count rates , and ordinate is those in the 0.53 kev .",
    "the results , shown in panel ( a ) of figure 2 to figure 7 , indeed indicate that the 0.53 kev count rate , to be denoted @xmath19 , varies linearly with that in 310 kev , @xmath20 .    for further quantification , we fitted the data in each ccp with one straight line , expressed as    @xmath21    in which the two parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , were both left free .",
    "the fit goodness was evaluated in terms of chi - square statistics using errors expressed as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are 1-sigma statistical errors associated with @xmath20 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "as shown in table 2 and indicated in panel ( a ) of figures 26 , the data distribution in each ccp has been reproduced successfully with equation ( 1 ) .",
    "therefore , the main variable component is considered to have varied without any change in its shape .",
    "in addition , the offset @xmath23 is significantly positive in all cases ( 2.42.8@xmath27 ) , indicating that some signals should remain in the 0.53 kev bands even when the intensity of the variable component becomes zero .",
    "this condition is the same as found with mrk 509 by noda et al .",
    "( 2011b ) , and allows us to apply the c3po method to the present five agns .",
    "we divided the 0.53 kev band of the individual agns into seven finer bands , 0.50.8 kev , 0.81 kev , 11.2 kev , 1.21.4 kev , 1.41.7 kev , 1.72 kev , and 23 kev .",
    "then , for each agn , we created seven additional ccps , where abscissa is again the 310 kev count rate while ordinate is those in the seven finer soft x - ray bands .",
    "the obtained ccps are presented in panels ( b ) to ( h ) of figure 2 to 6 .    to examine the data distribution in each ccp representing a finer energy band ,",
    "the fitting with one straight line expressed by equation ( 1 ) was again performed .",
    "the obtained parameter values are summarized in table 2 .",
    "thus , the fit with equation ( 1 ) was successful in most of the 35 ccps ( the seven bands of the five objects ) . in all objects ,",
    "furthermore , the ccps generally exhibit positive offsets ( @xmath28 ) , particularly in lower energy bands .",
    "these offsets , divided by the corresponding energy intervals , define a spectrum that represents the non - varying soft x - ray signals of each agn . in figure 7",
    ", we show these spectra in purple , after further normalizing to unabsorbed pl models with a photon index @xmath29 of which the normalizations were chosen to approximately reproduce the observed time - averaged spectra of the corresponding objects .    to quantify these stable soft emission ( hereafter sse ) spectra",
    ", we fitted them with five representative models ; power law ( ` powerlaw ` ) , multi - color disk ( ` diskbb ` ; mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) emission , thin - thermal plasma radiation ( ` apec ` ; smith et al .",
    "2001 ) , relativistically smeared and ionized reflection ( ` kdblur * reflionx ` ; laor 1991 , ross & fabian 2005 ) , and thermal comptonization ( ` comptt ` ; titarchuk 1994 ) .",
    "the fits all include the galactic line - of - sight absorption , which is modeled by ` wabs ` ( morrison and mccammon 1983 ) with the @xmath30 values given in table 1 . in fitting with the ` apec ` model , the abundance parameter was fixed at 0.5 solar , while the temperature and the normalization were left free . in the ` kdblur",
    "* reflionx ` model , the photon index of the primary continuum for reflection was fixed at 2 , and the inner and outer disk radii at 1.24  @xmath31 and 400  @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the emissivity index was also fixed at 4 .",
    "the other parameters , the inner radius , the ionization parameters , and the normalization , were all left free . in the ` comptt ` fit , the seed photon temperature was fixed at 0.02 kev , while the other parameters were left free .",
    "the redshifts in those models were fixed at the values given in table 1 .",
    "the obtained fit parameters are summarized in table 3 , which also gives the 0.53 kev luminosity of this component calculated by the ` apec ` model .",
    "thus , the five sse spectra can be reproduced successfully by any of the employed five models .",
    "they are characterized by a pl photon index of @xmath32 , or a disk temperature of @xmath33 kev , or an ` apec ` temperature of @xmath34 kev .",
    "if employing the relativistically blurred and ionized reflection model , the ionization parameter became @xmath35  erg @xmath5 s@xmath4 , with the inner disk radius fixed at 1.24  @xmath31 .",
    "when employing the thermal comptonization model with a seed photon temperature of @xmath36 kev , which can be calculated from the mass of a typical central bh of @xmath37 and an eddington ratio of @xmath38 , the coronal temperature becomes 0.31 kev and the optical depth @xmath39 .",
    "below , we do not consider the ` diskbb ` modeling , since its temperature is too high as already pointed out previously ( section 1 ) .",
    "the pl modeling may not be considered either , because the indicated steep pl does not accept easy interpretations . in other words ,",

    "thus , the hard - band ccps of fairall 9 and mcg-2 - 58 - 22 suggest statistically significant positive offsets ( though with large errors ) , so we divided them by the energy range of 20 kev , and show the results in figure 7 as ratios to the same @xmath29 pl .",

    "time - averaged and background - subtracted spectra of our agns are also shown , normalized to the same ( including the normalization ) @xmath29 pl as used to display the sse and she spectra .",
    "however , instead of summing all photons of each agn into a single spectrum , we accumulated them over two phases , hereafter called high and low phases , when the 310 kev source intensity is higher ( black ) and lower ( red ) than the average ( dotted line in figure 1 ) , respectively .    to examine shapes of the main variable spectral components , presumably pl - like , we subtracted low from high spectra , and show the derived difference spectra of the five agns in figure 8(a  e ) .",
    "each difference spectrum was fitted successfully by an absorbed cutoff pl model ( ` wabs * cutoffpl ` in xspec ) , in which the photon index and normalization , as well as the absorbing column @xmath30 , were left free , while the cutoff energy was fixed at 200 kev .",
    "therefore , in these agns , the varying signals can be expressed within errors by an absorbed pl ( with an assumed cutoff ) , in agreement with some previous studies ( e.g. , schmoll et al .",

    "conversely , the strongly - absorbed agn , 4c+74.26 , exhibits significantly higher absorption than the galactic value ( table 1 ) .",

    "then , can we arrive at the same spectral decomposition by analyzing the time - averaged ( i.e. , high - phase plus low - phase ) wide - band spectra of our sample objects ? to see this , we fitted these spectra with a model of ` wabs * zxipcf * ( cutoffpl + pexrav + zgauss ) ` . here , ` pexrav ` represents a reflection continuum from neutral matters ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) , and ` zgauss ` an fe i k@xmath61 line . `",

    "of 1083.54/657 , 1049.98/842 , 1206.17/846 , 692.57/603 , and 1161.51/866 for fairall 9 , mcg-2 - 58 - 22 , 3c382 , 4c+74.26 , and mr2251 - 178 , respectively .",
    "the fits are thus even worse than those with the ` apec ` modeling . given this , the ` reflionx ` component in the above fits",
    "were convolved with the relativistic smearing kernel , ` kdblur ` , with the emissivity index and the inner disk radius left free , while the outer radius fixed at 400 @xmath31 . then , as summarized in table 6 and shown in figure 10 , the fits to the time - averaged spectra of all the five agns were much improved and became acceptable for four sources , except mr2251 - 178 .    in the above successful fits to the 4 sources ( figure 10 ) , the soft - band ( @xmath278 kev ) excess is explained by the ` kdblur * reflionx ` component , while that in the hard band by ` kdblur * reflionx + pexrav ` .",
    "furthermore , the pl continua of the 4 sources ( table 6 ) , against which these soft and hard excesses are defined , are found to be consistent with their high - low difference spectra ( the main variable component ; table 4 , figure 8) .",
    "therefore , the two reflection models , jointly describing the static excess above the pl , should also be able to explain their sse and she data points which were determined by out dynamical c3po analysis .",
    "to examine this idea , we compared the ` kdblur * reflionx + pexrav ` components in figure 9 with the sse+she data points ( in purple ) , in terms of chi - square evaluation but without any parameter readjustment . as a result",
    ", good agreements were obtained in fairall 9 and 3c382 , with @xmath277/d.o.f . of 4.95/8 and 11.14/8 , respectively , while poor results in mcg-2 - 58 - 22 ( 19.79/8 ) and 4c+74.26 ( 23.50/8 ) .",
    "thus , the ` kdblur * reflionx + pexrav ` modeling failed to explain the time - averaged spectrum of one source ( mr2251 - 178 ) , and caused inconsistency between the static and dynamic results on two more sources ( mcg-2 - 58 - 22 and 4c+74.26 ) .    finally , we replaced the ` kdblur * reflionx ` model with the thermal comptonization model , ` comptt ` , and fitted the time - averaged spectra with a model of ` wabs * zxipcf * ( cutoffpl + pexrav + zgauss + comptt ) ` , except for fairall 9 which was fitted with ` wabs * ( cutoffpl + pexrav + zgauss + laor + comptt ) ` , and mr2251 - 178 with ` wabs * zxipcf * ( cutoffpl + pexrav + zgauss + 3 \\times zgauss + comptt ) ` . in these fits ,",
    "the disk temperature was fixed at 0.02 kev as before , and the electron temperature of ` comptt ` at 0.5 kev , following noda et al .",
    "( 2011b ) and mehdipour et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , while its optical depth and normalization were left free . like in the `",
    "apec ` modeling ( figure 9 ) , any hard - band excess above the pl is now represented solely by cold reflection ( ` pexrav ` ) . as summarized in table 7 and shown in figure 11 ,",
    "all the fits are acceptable , and the fit goodness is significantly ( except 3c382 ) better than those in table 6 .",
    "thus , the soft excess component , identified statically in each object using its time - averaged spectrum , can be reproduced by the comptonozation model .",
    "furthermore in these fits , the ` comptt ` component has a very similar shape and intensity to the sse spectrum .",
    "actually , when the best - fit ` comptt ` model is compared ( again without any parameter readjustment ) with the sse data points , we obtain @xmath277/d.o.f .",
    "of 4.01/7 for fairall 9 , 10.02/7 for mcg-2 - 58 - 22 , 9.52/7 for 3c382 , 9.51/7 for 4c+74.26 , and 5.97/7 for mr2251 - 178 , which are all acceptable .",
    "therefore , the soft excess structure in the time - averaged spectrum and the dynamically extracted sse spectrum can be regarded as two different manifestations of the same spectral component , which is considered to arise via thermal comptonization process .",
    "similarly , the she flux point of four sources ( except mr2251 - 178 ) appear to be consistent with the pexrav component .",
    "in fact , these she data points for fairall 9 and mcg-2 - 58 - 22 have + 2.1 and + 5.7 sigma significances above zero , respectively , while they deviate from the pexrav model predictions by 1.0 and 2.8 sigmas , respectively . similarly , the she data points of 3c 382 and 4c+74.26 ( which are both statistically insignificant ) deviate from their pexrav predictions by only 0.1 and 0.8 sigmas , respectively .",
    "thus , the dynamically derived she can be identified ( within the large errors ) with the pexrav model required by the time - averaged spectrum .",
    "to study the origin of soft excess phenomena , five agns with different types were selected from the suzaku archive , and analyzed ; fairall 9 ( sy1 ) , mcg-2 - 58 - 22 ( sy1.5 ) , 3c382 ( blrg ) , 4c+74.26 ( rlq ) , and mr2251 - 178 ( rqq ) , which have x - ray signals dominated by emission from their central engines . applying the c3po method developed in noda et al .",
    "( 2011b ) and churazov , gilfanov , and revnivtsev ( 2001 ) , who detected an sse in the bright sy1 mrk 509 and the typical bhb cyg x-1 , respectively , we succeeded in extracting an sse in the 0.53 kev band of all the five agns .",
    "in addition , the application of the same technique to the 1545 kev hxd - pin data allowed us to detect the she from at least two of the five agns .",
    "the highly linear ccps we obtained rule out possibilities that the soft x - ray variations of our sample agns are caused by changes in any absorption , including in particular a partially covering warm absorber which is one of the three main interpretations explaining the soft excess phenomena of agns ( section 1 ) .",
    "this is because a partially covering absorber , if variable in its covering fraction , column density , or ionization degree , would cause complex spectral changes , so the ccp would not show such a linear distribution as in figure 26 .",
    "furthermore , in this case the soft x - ray count would vanish , without leaving a positive offset , when the pl intensity becomes zero .",
    "thus , the sses must be more independent of the pl continuum .",
    "the sse spectra , extracted from the five agns via the c3po analysis , were reproduced successfully by five spectral models ; pl , ` diskbb ` , ` apec ` , ` kdblur * reflionx ` and ` comptt ` . from physical considerations ,",
    "two of them , the pl and ` diskbb ` , were ruled out . combining the static analysis with the dynamical one , ` apec `",
    "was found to be unrealistic .",
    "furthermore , as given in figure 12 , the measured 0.53 kev luminosity of the sse of our agns is too high for thermal emission from their host galaxies ( which would be at most @xmath279 erg s@xmath4 ; e.g. , fukazawa et al .",
    "2006 ) , and correlates positively with the agn luminosity .",
    "therefore , the sse must be tightly connected to the agn phenomenon , rather than to the host galaxies .",
    "how about the relativistically - smeared and ionized reflection interpretation modeled by ` kdblur * reflionx ` ? when a fine - tuned geometry is actually realized to enable the `` light bending '' effect ( e.g. , miniutti et al .",
    "2007 ) , the reflection would not necessarily have to follow variations of the primary emission , and may remain stable like the sse . to examine whether or not this interpretation is appropriate , the broad energy coverage with suzaku is particularly important , because the reflection signals from an ionized disk are expected to appear both at the softest and hardest spectral ends . when figure 10 is closely examined , we find that the model invoking kdblur * reflionx + pexrav tends to under - predict the @xmath280 kev portion of the time - averaged data , and over - predict the time - averaged hxd data .",
    "this effect indeed made the fit to mr2251 - 178 unacceptable .",
    "furthermore , at least in mcg-2 - 58 - 22 and 4c+74.26 , the kdblur * reflionx + pexrav component determined through our static analysis was not able to explain the dynamically determined sse+she signals .",
    "thus , the relativistic reflection interpretation can not explain the broad - band suzaku data of three out of the 5 agns .",
    "in contrast , the thermal comptonization interpretation , using comptt , can consistently explain , in all the 5 agns , both the dynamically derived sse and the static soft excess .",
    "this agreement between the two independent methods significantly strengthens the determination of the soft excess signals ( or the sse ) in our sample agns . in this case , the she can be explained as a separate component arising from a cold reflector that is most likely located at a considerable distance from the central engine .    presuming that the sse is produced as a thermal comptonization component which is separate from ( but related to ) the dominant pl , the corona of each agn",
    "is then considered to consist of multiple regions having different optical depths and/or temperatures , namely , different compton y - parameters .",
    "this may be called multi - zone comptonization ( mzc ) condition .",
    "since the various types of agns which have been selected in the present paper all have x - ray signals dominated by non - jet continua , their central engines ( where most of the gravitational energy is converted to radiation ) are inferred to be in the mzc condition .",
    "this agrees with the previous results on mrk 509 ( noda et al .",
    "2011b ; mehdipour et al .",
    "2011 ) , and the leading bhb cyg x-1 ( e.g. , makishima et al .",
    "2008 , yamada 2011 ) .",
    "the lack of significant short - term ( @xmath281 several hundred ks ) variability in the sse may be explained if the sse - producing compton corona is largely ( @xmath282 several hundred gravitational radii ) extended , or more likely , if the seed - photon flux ( presumably from the disk ) is stable on these time scales while the dominant pl variations are produced in those part of the corona with the largest y - parameter ( makishima et al .",
    "overall , we suggest that the soft excess emission of some ( if not all ) agns is actually a part of its primary continuum , produced in grossly the same central engine as the pl component , but possibly at somewhat different locations considering the clear difference in their variation characteristics . in this interpretation ,",
    "the she is considered to have a different origin from the sse , and produced via reflection by distant cool materials as represented by ` pexrav ` .",
    "the present results have impacts not only on the central engine , but also on the determination and interpretation of various secondary spectral components , including disk reflection , iron lines , and warm absorbers .",
    "this is because the mzc condition affects the primary continuum shape , which was often assumed conventionally as a single pl .",
    "for example , noda et al . ( 2011a ) found that the iron k@xmath61-line width of the type i seyfert , mcg6 - 30 - 15 , decreases considerably , when including a hard component , which varied independently of the dominant pl and made the primary continuum concave .",
