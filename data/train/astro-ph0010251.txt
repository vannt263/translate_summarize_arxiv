    "a number of clusters of galaxies are known to contain large - scale diffuse radio sources which have no obvious connection to the clusters population of galaxies .",
    "these sources are referred to as radio halos when they appear projected on the center of the cluster , and are called relics when they are found on the cluster periphery .",
    "because of projection effects , the distinction between halos and relics is physically debatable , but does provide a convenient classification for their discussion .",
    "it is also possible that halos and relics in fact have different physical origins , as we discuss below",
    ". halos ( and relics ; we will use `` halos '' hereafter for brevity ) are believed to be produced by synchrotron emission from a population of relativistic electrons which have been accelerated or reaccelerated , possibly by shocks in the intracluster medium ( e.g. , jaffe 1977 ; roland 1981 ; schlickeiser et al .",
    "these shocks may be the product of cluster mergers .",
    "in fact , all known halos are found in clusters which show other signs of being in some stage of a merger ( e.g. , feretti 1999 ; schuecker & bhringer 1999 ) . in the early stages of mergers ,",
    "halos are often found on the border between the subclusters , where the cluster gas is first being shocked ( e.g. , abell 85 ; slee & reynolds 1984 ) . in more advanced mergers ,",
    "more conventional centrally located halos ( e.g. , coma ) and peripheral relics ( e.g. , abell 3667 ) are found .",
    "the most common explanation of the physical origin of halos and relics is that they originate from particle acceleration in merger shocks , but other theories have been suggested .",
    "enlin et al .  (",
    "1998 ) suggest that relics may trace shocks created in the initial structure formation of the universe .",
    "liang et al .  ( 2000 ) posits that turbulent reacceleration may maintain the population of cosmic rays necessary to produce a halo after they have been accelerated initially by merger shocks .",
    "there is also disagreement over whether the cosmic ray electrons are accelerated directly from the thermal population or are re - accelerated cosmic rays previously produced in starbursts and agn . alternately , the secondary electron model ( dennison 1980 ; blasi & colafrancesco 1999 and references therein ) proposes that the necessary electrons are created as a result of interactions between cosmic ray protons and the intracluster gas .",
    "the secondary electron model is unique in that it does not require a merger to create a radio halo .",
    "halos and relics are rare phenomena , with only about 1020 having been known until quite recently . with the completion of the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss : condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss : rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ) , systematic searches for additional sources have been possible , yielding about 25 new halos and relics .",
    "evidence on the exact origin of halos and relics is still unclear , mostly because of their small numbers . with a larger sample",
    ", however we can begin to determine if the merger shock picture of their formation is correct , and perhaps even disentangle the different mechanisms for halo and relic formation , if they are in fact different phenomena .",
    "we assume @xmath0 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 and @xmath2 throughout this paper .",
    "we conducted our search for new halos and relics using the publicly available images of the wenss .",
    "the survey has an angular resolution of @xmath3 at declination @xmath4 , a typical noise level of 3.6  mjy beam@xmath1 , and covers the sky north of @xmath5 .",
    "our search was strictly limited to galaxy clusters in the aco catalog ( abell 1958 ; abell , corwin & olowin 1989 ) that fall within the region covered by the wenss .",
    "this gave us a sample of 1001 clusters up to a redshift of @xmath6 .",
    "with the good @xmath7 coverage of the survey , the images were sensitive to extended structures of up to @xmath8 in diameter .",
    "we were therefore able to detect cluster - wide halos with a typical size of 1  mpc at redshifts @xmath9 , which covers the entire abell catalog .",
    "sources 1  mpc in size do not become unresolved by the wenss beam until a redshift much greater than the limit of the abell catalog .    we searched for diffuse sources using images from the wenss on their own as well as using these images overlaid on images from the digital sky survey ( dss ) . our criteria for a positive detection were that the sources had to _ a ) _ have regions of surface brightness greater than the 2@xmath10 level , _ b ) _ be resolved , _ c ) _ not be associated with an optically identified galaxy , _ d ) _ not be clearly associated with a known extended radio galaxy , and _",
    "e ) _ not be an obvious blend of unresolved sources .",
    "we used images from the nvss , and from the first survey where available ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) to check for the existence of point sources . in clusters within about @xmath8 of a very bright ( peak - flux - to - rms @xmath11 )",
    "source , uncleaned sidelobe structure had the potential for causing confusion , but the large sizes of the wenss images enabled us to identify these cases and avoid confusion .",
    "we further compared the wenss images to images from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ; voges 1992 ; trmper 1993 ) for information about the x - ray morphology of the clusters .    for sources which are resolved but smaller than about @xmath8 ,",
    "the wenss is surface brightness limited .",
    "figure  [ fig : sensitivity_sb ] shows the mean surface brightnesses of the sources in our sample as a function of redshift .",
    "the dashed line is the nominal 1@xmath10 surface brightness limit of wenss ( 3.6  mjy beam@xmath1 ) .",
    "the mean surface brightness was determined for each source by spreading its integrated flux evenly over a convex region which just encloses the 2@xmath10 surface brightness contours for that source .",
    "in reality , however , few of the sources fill this region completely , and most of them have splotchy surface brightness distributions with peaks which are much higher than this average value .",
    "this is the reason that our survey limit on the mean surface brightness appears to be be slightly below the wenss noise limit .",
    "note that our cluster survey would not be sensitive to sources which are very close or very large ( @xmath12@xmath8 ) or sources which are very small or very distant , which would be unresolved ( @xmath131 ) .",

    "we also observe a central radio halo which was detected by bridle & fomalont ( 1976 ) at 610  mhz , and which is easily visible in the wenss . because of its very low surface brightness ( it is rarely brighter than 2 mjy beam@xmath1 in the wenss image ) and its ultra - steep spectrum ,",
    "this halo has largely been ignored by subsequent studies of a 2256 , which have instead focused on the relic and the numerous head - tail galaxies in the cluster .",

    "( 1972 ) found the spectral index of a 2256 between 22.25 and 81.5  mhz to be @xmath23 , suggesting the presence of a centrally located ultra - steep spectrum source .",
    "their data also suggest that this source is of comparable size to , or slightly bigger than the observed extent of the halo at 327  mhz .",
    "based on this steep spectral index and the halo s flux at 610  mhz ( bridle & fomalont 1976 ) , we would expect a flux more than 2.5 times what we observe at 327  mhz .",
    "however , since the halo is quite faint and is perhaps slightly larger than is evident from the wenss image , our measurement should be taken as a lower limit to the actual flux of the halo .",
    "the flux of the halo at 1400  mhz is expected to be below the sensitivity of the nvss , and indeed it is not seen there at all .",
    "the halo and relic measurements are listed separately in table  [ tab : radio ] and are named accordingly .    _ a 2319 .",
    "_ this halo was studied extensively by feretti et al.(1997b ) .",
    "it is much more extended than it appears in either the wenss or nvss , so much of the total flux in the halo is missing in our measurements from both surveys .",
    "we now consider the correlation between the radio power of a cluster halo or relic and the cluster s other properties .",
    "we begin by limiting our statistical analyses to the radio measurements done in this study , because of the difficulty of developing a consistent sample of low - frequency radio data on radio halos and relics based on previous observations .",
    "most previous large surveys of these objects have been done at 20  cm .",
    "we then discuss correlations at higher frequencies and attempt to apply them to our 327  mhz data .",
    "we find no significant correlation between the radio power of the source and the rs type or the abell richness class of the cluster .",
    "the distribution of halo / relic candidates in redshift space is uniform , but given the small number of clusters in which we detect diffuse radio emission , this result is probably not meaningful .",
    "2.45truein    0.2truein    we do not find a correlation between radio power and x - ray luminosity when halos and relics are considered together ( figure  [ fig : p - l ] ) .",
    "when considered separately , we find a correlation coefficient of @xmath24 for halos , consistent with no correlation .",
    "this may , however , be a result of missing flux from having few short baselines , as more complete data at 1.4  ghz ( feretti 2000 ; liang et al .",
    "2000 ) do show a correlation .",
    "relics show no sign of a correlation either , although the x - ray data for these clusters is quite poor .",
    "it should be noted that the clusters in which we find the first evidence of diffuse radio emission all display relatively faint halos or relics and generally have x - ray luminosities which are comparable to or slightly fainter than those of clusters already known to have halos or relics . with better radio data for these sources , they may extend the correlation found at 1.4  ghz .",
    "we now consider a very simple analytic model for the radio luminosity as a function of x - ray luminosity , on the assumption that the radio emitting electrons are accelerated in cluster mergers . in general , a cluster of mass @xmath25 may undergo mergers with clusters or groups having any mass @xmath26 .",
    "( we take the mass @xmath25 to apply to the larger subcluster in the merger . )",
    "however , mergers with much smaller subclusters are unlikely to produce very strong shocks with large energy fluxes .",
    "thus , we consider only major mergers with @xmath27 , and for simplicity we assume that the mergers are symmetric ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "mergers occur with a distribution of impact parameters @xmath29 , which can affect the strength of the shocks produced ( e.g. , ricker & sarazin 2000 ) . to simplify the model , we assume that the mergers occur with @xmath30 ( zero impact parameter , or a head - on merger )",
    ". a distribution of values of @xmath31 and @xmath29 should introduce dispersion into the correlation between x - ray and radio luminosities , but should not affect the correlation itself . let us characterize each of the subclusters by the mass @xmath25 , characteristic radius @xmath32 , and velocity dispersion @xmath10 .    to begin with , we assume that the radio emitting electrons have short lifetimes and are accelerated by cluster merger shocks .",
    "radio observations of galactic supernova remnants indicate that shocks at velocities similar to those in cluster mergers convert @xmath333% of the shock energy flux into accelerating relativistic electrons ( e.g. , blandford & eichler 1987 ) .",

    "assume the two subcluster approach with a velocity @xmath38 .",
    "then , the rate of energy deposition by shocks is approximately @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the pre - shock density of the thermal gas in the intracluster medium ( icm ) , and @xmath41 is the cross - sectional area of the merger shocks",
    ". the merger velocity of subclusters is determined by their infall velocity from the turnaround radius in the hubble flow , and is close to the escape velocity .",

    "the average density of the thermal gas is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total gas mass in the cluster .",
    "we write the gas mass as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the cluster gas fraction .",
    "the x - ray observations of rich clusters indicate that @xmath47 constant ( e.g. , arnaud & evrard 1999 )",
    ".    we will assume that the magnetic field strength @xmath48 in the cluster radio source is @xmath133 @xmath49 g , so that the main loss process for the radio emitting electrons is inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background photons",
    ". then the lifetime of an electron with an energy of @xmath50 is ( e.g. , sarazin 1999 ) @xmath51 the average frequency of synchrotron radiation produced by an electron with a lorentz factor of @xmath52 is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the pitch angle of the electron ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath55 so that the electrons which produce the radio emission we observe have @xmath56 and short lifetimes @xmath57 yr . since these times are shorter than the durations of cluster mergers , one expects to find radio emission only during the merger .",
    "this result has been found previously based on more detailed models ( e.g. , sarazin 1999 ; takizawa & naito 2000 ) .",
    "the total energy in cosmic ray electrons is then @xmath58 it is also useful to replace the radius @xmath32 , which is poorly defined observationally , with the gas temperature @xmath59 .",
    "the gas in clusters is in hydrostatic equilibrium , which implies that @xmath60 the total energy of cosmic ray electrons then varies as @xmath61 alternatively , we can use the cluster x - ray luminosity @xmath62 to parameterize the size of the cluster .",
    "the x - ray luminosity ",
    "temperature relationship is approximately @xmath63 ( e.g. , arnaud & evrard 1999 ) .",
    "thus , the energy in relativistic electrons varies as @xmath64    the diffuse radio emission from a cluster depends both on the population of relativistic electrons and on the magnetic field .",
    "we consider two simple models for the variation in the field strength from cluster to cluster .",
    "first , we assume that the magnetic field is constant from cluster to cluster . in this case , electrons with the same energy or lorentz factor produce radio emission at the same frequencies in all clusters , and the total magnetic energy density is the same in all clusters .",
    "then , the radio luminosity @xmath65 , so that the radio power at an emitted frequency @xmath66 varies as @xmath67 these relations are too flat to fit the observed relations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p - l ] ; feretti 2000 ; liang et al .",
    "2000 ) .    as an alternative model ,",
    "we assume that the magnetic field varies from cluster to cluster in such a way that the magnetic pressure is a fixed proportion of the gas pressure in the intracluster medium .",
    "this might occur as a result of turbulence generated in merger shocks .",
    "then , the magnetic field strength varies as @xmath68 assuming that clusters form from large scale structure and that the gas is hydrostatic implies that the cluster mass and gas temperature are related by @xmath69 ( bryan & norman 1998 ) , and this is consistent with the observations of clusters ( horner , mushotzky , & scharf 1999 ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath70    varying the magnetic field also varies the energy of the electrons which contribute to the radio emission at a given observing frequency @xmath66 according to equation  ( [ eq : nu_rad ] ) , and this affects the number of electrons effective at synchrotron emission at this frequency .",
    "we assume that the electron population is a power - law in @xmath52 , with @xmath71 being the total number of electrons with energies in the range @xmath52 to @xmath72 .",
    "we determine the power - law index @xmath73 from the observed radio spectral index @xmath74 , which gives @xmath75 .",
    "although the spectral indices vary from cluster to cluster , we assume that there is no consistent variation with cluster x - ray luminosity @xmath62 or temperature @xmath59 .",
    "we assume the electron populations is in steady - state , which implies that the total number of particles or the normalization of the electron spectrum varies as @xmath76 from synchrotron theory , the radio power at a frequency @xmath66 varies as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "this leads to @xmath79    these relations between radio power @xmath80 and @xmath62 or @xmath59 are somewhat steeper than those produced by a constant magnetic field ( eq .  [ eq : power_simple ] ) , but are only a small improvement in terms of fitting the data .",
    "we first tried varying @xmath74 , and found a best fit for @xmath81 , which is unreasonably steep .",
    "we then fit the @xmath62@xmath82 data in feretti ( 2000 ) using this relation for several values of @xmath74 that are consistent with our data .",
    "an example of these fits is shown in figure  [ fig : p1.4-l ] .",
    "since the slope is not very sensitive to @xmath74 , we show a fit for only one typical value  other values give a similar fit .",
    "this fit differs from the best fit by about 2.5@xmath10 .",
    "2.35truein    for the purposes of considering the radio detectability of halos , it is worth considering how the radio surface brightness @xmath83 and radio halo size might vary with x - ray luminosity or temperature . the physical radius of a cluster is expected to vary with temperature as @xmath84 ( e.g. , mohr , mathiesen , & evrard 1999 ) . if the temperature vs.  x - ray luminosity relation is @xmath85 as assumed above , the cluster size varies as @xmath86 .",
    "if we assume that the size of the radio halo is proportional to the cluster size @xmath32 , then @xmath87 for a fixed magnetic field , and @xmath88 when the magnetic pressure increases in proportion to the gas pressure .",
    "these relations are even flatter than those for the radio power .",
    "the discussion so far has concentrated on the radio  x - ray correlations for clusters with detected radio halos .",
    "however , radio halos are relatively rare , and most clusters do not show diffuse radio emission at a detectable level . in a model where the radio - emitting electrons are accelerated during cluster mergers this is easily understood , since these electrons have short lifetimes and will only be present during the period of stronger merger hydrodynamical interaction .",
    "since clusters showing x - ray evidence for strong merger shocks are also relatively rare and all radio halo clusters appear to be undergoing mergers , this can explain , at least qualitatively , the low rate of occurrence of radio halos and relics .",
    "we also find that luminous halos and relics are generally not found in clusters with low x - ray luminosities .",
    "the nvss radio survey at 20  cm found a similar result ( giovannini et al .",
    "this relationship between x - ray luminosity and the detection of a halo or relic appears in several other forms , as well .",
    "the abell clusters north of @xmath89 that fall into the ebeling et al .",
    "( 1996 ) x - ray  bright cluster sample comprise less than 20% of our initial sample , but make up 65% of the clusters in which we find diffuse emission . if x - ray luminosity and the radio halo luminosity were uncorrelated and the halo detection rate from the ebeling et al .",
    "( 1996 ) sample held for fainter clusters , we would expect to find a radio halo or relic in about 200 of the clusters we studied .    surely , some of the low x - ray luminosity clusters in the abell catalog are also undergoing mergers , and may have particle acceleration .",
    "why are these lower luminosity clusters not detected in radio ?",
    "the observations of clusters indicate that there is a steep correlation of radio power with x - ray luminosity or temperature ; our simple merger shock model also implies a steep correlation , although probably not as steep as the data . here , we consider the possibility that the failure to detect radio halos in low x - ray luminosity clusters results from this correlation and the radio sensitivity of our survey .",
    "we assume that the correlation between radio halo and x - ray luminosity seen for bright clusters ( feretti 2000 ) continues to lower x - ray luminosities .",
    "the surface brightness sensitivity limit of our search technique is taken to be that of the wenss , shown in figure  [ fig : sensitivity_sb ] .",
    "we determine the predicted surface brightnesses of clusters as a function of x - ray luminosity @xmath62 and redshift . for a cluster with a given x - ray luminosity",
    ", we used the radio power vs.  x - ray luminosity relation ( figure  [ fig : p - l ] ) to determine its radio power at 327  mhz .    to determine the predicted mean radio surface brightness of the halo",
    ", we also need to know its physical size .",
    "it seems likely that that bigger clusters , which have larger x - ray luminosities , will also have larger radio halos .",
    "for example , it may be that radio halo sizes are proportional to the overall sizes of clusters . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : disc_model ] , this leads to the radio halo size varying with x - ray luminosity roughly as @xmath86 . in our sample of radio halos , there is no clear evidence for a variation of the size of the halo with the x - ray luminosity of the cluster .",
    "however , it may be that our sample is too small , or that the sizes deduced from the wenss images are too uncertain .",
    "figure  [ fig : size - l ] plots the sizes of the radio halos from the sample in feretti ( 2000 ) as a function of the cluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "this sample does show some evidence for a size - luminosity relationship .",
    "the dashed curve is the best - fit relation which follows the cluster radius vs.  x - ray luminosity relation , @xmath86 .",
    "the solid curve is the best - fit power - law relation with an arbitrary exponent .",
    "this best - fit corresponds roughly to @xmath90 .",
    "2.55truein    0.2truein    the sizes shown in figure  [ fig : size - l ] are largest linear size ( @xmath91 ) values .",
    "typically , the regions covered by the radio halos are not circular . for the halo sources in our survey , the average area of the source ( the area used to determine its mean surface brightness in figure  [ fig : sensitivity_sb ] ) is given by @xmath92 .",
    "we use the same factor to determine the predicted area of a source of a given x - ray luminosity ; its mean surface brightness at 327 mhz in the cluster rest frame is then determined by dividing the predicted radio power @xmath93 by the predicted area of the halo . for the observed radio power and radio size vs.  x - ray luminosity relations ,",
    "the predicted mean radio surface brightness is a monotonically increasing function of the x - ray luminosity .    for a cluster at a redshift of @xmath14 , the observed surface brightness at an observing frequency of 327 mhz",
    "is reduced by a factor of @xmath94 .",
    "we assume a typical spectral index of @xmath95 to determine the observed surface brightness .",
    "this observed mean surface brightness was compared to the surface brightness limit of our survey ( figure  [ fig : sensitivity_sb ] ) , and the x - ray luminosity of the faintest detectable cluster was determined .",
    "this limiting @xmath62 is plotted versus redshift as the solid curve in figure  [ fig : l - z ] .",
    "this limit is incorrect for very small redshifts where the halos may be too large in angular size , and at very large redshift where the halos might be unresolved .",
    "the sense of these differences is to make the clusters harder to detect .",
    "it is clear that the detections are roughly consistent with the survey sensitivity and the radio  x - ray correlations .",
    "abell  2255 is the only cluster to lie at or below the limit , but as figure  [ fig : p - l ] shows , this cluster deviates substantially from the best - fit @xmath62@xmath80 relation with a low x - ray luminosity given its radio power .",
    "it is clear that radio halos in fainter x - ray clusters ( @xmath96 ergs s@xmath1 ) would be too weak to be observed , if they follow the radio  x - ray correlations observed for brighter clusters .",
    "of course , there may be other selection effects affecting the detection rates of clusters .",
    "for example , some of the radio halo detections have resulted from deep radio observations of sunyaev - zeldovich clusters to remove radio sources ( e.g. , moffet & birkinshaw 1989 ; liang et al .",
    "since the s - z clusters tend to be selected as the hottest , highest x - ray luminosity clusters , this might explain part of the correlation of radio halo detections with cluster x - ray temperature or luminosity .",
    "we have discovered 7 new candidate radio halos and relics in a search of abell clusters in the wenss .",
    "we also confirm the presence of diffuse emission in 7 clusters and find further evidence of such emission in 2 more clusters where the presence of a halo has been posited but remains uncertain .",
    "our search technique detected all but one previously known source that fell within our sample .",
    "more detailed radio observations of the new radio halos and relics would be very useful to accurately determine their structure .",
    "we argue that radio halos or relics are only found in clusters which are currently undergoing a cluster merger .",
    "all the clusters in our sample show evidence for a merger from either their x - ray surface brightness distribution or their galaxy distribution .",
    "this can explain the relative rarity of diffuse radio emission in clusters .",
    "we also find weak evidence for the observed correlation between monochromatic power of radio halos and cluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "we present a very simple model for the correlation of radio power with x - ray luminosity or temperature in clusters which are currently merging , on the assumption that the radio - emitting electrons are accelerated by merger shocks .",
    "we consider two cases for this model : one in which the magnetic field is the same for all clusters and one in which the field varies as a fixed proportion of the gas pressure .",
    "the latter model is marginally more successful at fitting the data .",
    "this argument predicts a strong radio  x - ray luminosity correlation , although not as steep as the one observed at 20  cm .",
    "our survey is the first to look for halos in a large sample of clusters with low x - ray luminosity . in general ,",
    "radio halos and relics are not found in low x - ray luminosity clusters .",
    "we argue that this is the result of the steep radio power vs.  x - ray luminosity correlation .",
    "if this is true , many more low luminosity clusters could be detected as diffuse radio sources if the sensitivities of the surveys could be greatly increased . clearly , deeper imaging with high sensitivity at short ( @xmath97 ) spacings is necessary to test whether the @xmath98 correlation holds at lower x - ray luminosities .",
