    ", the figure shows a lirg , a starburst galaxy and a normal galaxy . aside from the dearth of red early - type lirgs ( only 5 of the 119 lirgs",
    "are classified as ellipticals ) , morphology is not a good predictor of ir luminosity .",
    "table [ table : lirgmorph ] reports the morphological typing of the 119 lirgs binned into 3 equal volume bins ( low , intermediate and high redshift ) and 1 additional low redshift bin to highlight morphology evolution of the sample .",

    "first , the number density of lirgs has dropped by 50% from the high redshift bin to the intermediate redshift bin , and continues to drop in the low redshift bins .",

    "the peculiar to spiral ratio for lirgs is @xmath43 , whereas below @xmath3 the peculiar to spiral ratio is @xmath44 .",

    "we caution that the reclassification of 4 low z objects would be enough to change these fractions to match the higher @xmath7 results",
    ". therefore , larger samples of low-@xmath7 lirgs will be helpful in verifying if this trend is real .",

    "this plot illustrates the morphological evolution hinted at in the previous analysis . in the high redshift bin , spirals and peculiars",

    "the two populations segregate with the peculiars systematically at higher ir luminosity than the spirals .",
    "this results in a change of the lirg peculiar to spiral ratio .",
    "the morphological segregation of low-@xmath7 ir luminous galaxies has been observed by ishida ( 2004 ) in a statistically complete sample of 56 local lirgs drawn from iras bright galaxy sample ( soifer et al .",
    "the ishida study finds that 100% of galaxies with log(@xmath48 show at least some evidence for tidal features .",
    "the majority of galaxies with @xmath49 log(@xmath50 , also tend to be disturbed but @xmath51 are bright isolated spirals .",
    "the ishida study indicates that at lower ir luminosities , spirals comprise a larger fraction of the total .",
    "the implications of these morphological changes with redshift will be explored in the discussion section .    while morphology does not appear to be a good indicator of ir luminosity for blue galaxies , @xmath47 , absolute @xmath6 magnitude is .",
    "blue galaxies ( filled symbols in figure [ fig : mbir ] ) show a clear trend of increasing ir luminosity with @xmath6 , regardless of morphology .",
    "this trend , shown previously without a color - cut ( chary & elbaz 2001 ; le floch et al .",
    "2005 ) , was found to have a large scatter . with a color - cut , this scatter is significantly reduced . for our sample , the rms scatter in ir luminosity about the best - fit line ( black line , a bivariate least - squares fit to the full sample of blue galaxies , used for illustrative purposes ) drops from @xmath52 dex without the color - cut to @xmath9 dex with the cut .",
    "this scatter is actually somewhat smaller than our roughly estimated ir luminosity error ( @xmath53 dex ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mbir ] shows that both the optical and ir luminosities of the blue galaxies are increasing with redshift .",
    "roughly 75% of blue galaxies brighter than the characteristic luminosity of @xmath54 ( red vertical line ) are lirgs , regardless of redshift .",
    "only 3 of the 93 blue galaxies brighter than this limit are undetected in the mips image .",
    "studies of galaxies in the uv and optical have shown that the average comoving star formation rate ( sfr ) density of the universe has declined by a factor of @xmath55 since @xmath1 ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; madau et al . 1998 ; hogg et al . 1998",
    "; among others ) , and observations in the sub mm wavelengths indicate that it may have peaked around @xmath56 ( chapman et al .",
    "because ir luminosity strongly correlates with sfr ( kennicutt 1998 ) , we see a decline , by @xmath57 in the numbers of lirgs from the high redshift bin ( @xmath58 ) to the intermediate ( @xmath14 ) and low ( @xmath59 ) redshift bins .",
    "this drop in lirg numbers matches well the results from le floch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who found that the comoving ir energy density evolves as @xmath60 . assuming the drop in ir energy density were dominated by a reduction in the number of lirgs",
    ", we expect a 50% drop in the number of lirgs of from @xmath1 to @xmath61 , which is what we find . despite this decline , @xmath62 of the brightest ( @xmath54 ) ,",
    "blue ( @xmath63 ) galaxies are lirgs , regardless of redshift .",
    "therefore it appears that the @xmath64-band optical and ir luminosities of galaxies are linked , with sfr as an obvious candidate for the connection .",
    "a large gas supply is required to sustain elevated sfr at the lirg level .",
    "a lirg event in the milky way lasting only 100 myr would use up the entire galactic hi - disk gas supply ( assuming @xmath65 of hi gas , nakanishi & sofue 2003 ) . however , roughly half of the intermediate and high redshift lirgs in our sample are comprised of large normal looking spirals like the milky way , the difference being that high-@xmath7 lirg spirals can be as luminous in the ir as peculiar galaxies .",
    "bell05 finds that lirg spirals tend to be massive with stellar masses @xmath66 .",
    "figure 4 of bell05 shows that the specific sfr of a handful of the most massive lirgs are at or below their past average , indicating that either these galaxies experienced multiple lirg events , or have had enough gas to continuously form stars at a lirg level .",
    "eventually this gas , if not resupplied , will be used up . at low redshift , the make - up of the lirg population changes .",
    "lirg spirals exhibit lower ir luminosities than their peculiar counterparts , and also become more rare .",
    "possible explanations for this include 1 ) the gas reservoirs in spirals are depleted with time , or 2 ) gas accretion is reduced with time . with a depleted gas supply , and/or reduced gas accretion ,",
    "large local spirals can still form stars but generally at rates and below the lirg level .",
    "one way to build up a large , high - density gas supply at low-@xmath7 is to merge spirals together , an event revealed by peculiar morphology .",
    "this picture of gas depletion differs from that of h05 , who suggest that major mergers of spirals are driving the star formation and creation of lirgs since @xmath2 . in the h05 picture ,",
    "most intermediate - mass spirals undergo at least one major merger since @xmath2 , during which the morphology changes from spiral to peculiar ( merger ) to compact ( bulge formation ) to spiral again ( gas infall reforms the disk ) .",
    "if this scenario is responsible for most lirgs , the process should maintain a roughly constant peculiar to spiral ratio , as each morphological phase leads , proportionally in time , into the next .",
    "such a prediction is hard to reconcile with both the large fraction of undisturbed spirals at high redshift and the evolutionary changes seen in the morphological fractions of lirgs .    while the changing peculiar to spiral ratio may appear at face value to be incompatible with the h05 picture",
    ", we would like to caution the reader on several points .",
    "first the evidence against the h05 picture is based on visual morphological classifications and thus somewhat subjective .",
    "while identification of major mergers is relatively straight forward at low redshift , tidal features and other indications of peculiar morphology become harder to identify at higher redshift , as signal - to - noise drops . by using very deep optical imaging and cloning the low-@xmath7 objects to higher redshift , we have tried to minimize these concerns . in the future ,",
    "adoption of quantitative morphological indicators such as concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness ( conselice 2003 ) and gini / m@xmath67 ( lotz , primack & madau 2004 ) may help alleviate these concerns .",
    "secondly , larger samples preferably in other parts of the sky will help to account for cosmic variance and increase our relatively modest sample of low redshift lirgs .",
    "thirdly , gas depletion at low-@xmath7 may itself change the disk rebuilding efficiency in the h05 scenario and result in altered lirg morphological fractions .",
    "we would like to thank leonidas moustakas , mark dickinson , and ranga - ram chary , catherine ishida and sandra faber for helpful comments on the project .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the nsf science and technology center for adaptive optics managed by uc santa cruz under the cooperative agreement no ."
