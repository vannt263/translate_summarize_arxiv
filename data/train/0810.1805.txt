    "unfortunately both models  la yukawa , with @xmath15 , @xmath16 exchanges and quark - based models with @xmath17 annihilation and @xmath18 creation were able to reproduce quite well these early data .",
    "it was then decided to measure the reaction with a transversally - polarised target and to focus on @xmath19 and @xmath20 which measure how the transverse polarisation of the proton is modified in the @xmath13 or transferred to the @xmath14 .",
    "it was estimated that the two above classes of models give drastically different predictions for these observables , one with @xmath21 and another with @xmath22 .",

    "when the data of @xmath19 eventually came , it was disappointing to get an almost vanishing value , making it difficult to distinguish among models .",
    "we now realise that this @xmath23 could have been anticipated from a more careful analysis of the data obtained without target polarisation .",
    "there are in particular model - independent inequalities @xmath24 which indicate that at energies and angles where @xmath25 or @xmath26 is large , @xmath19 should be small . here , @xmath27 is the spin correlation in the final state , for the longitudinal ( @xmath28 ) or sideways ( @xmath29 ) directions in the scattering plane .",
