    "the second choice of initial set is a microcanonical initial distribution which is obtained by choosing randomly points over the accessible phase space . since there is no apparent regular ( stable ) structures ( see the finite - time lyapunov maps in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] below ) the two kinds of initial sets lead to approximately similar results if the integration time as well as the number of points are sufficiently large . due to this chaotic property",
    ", we can also select partial microcanonical distributions ( randomly chosen points of a small portion of the accessible region of phase space ) as other sets of initial conditions .",
    "we have checked that all these initial sets lead to the same ionization probability curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we notice , though , that for the microcanonical distributions , the ionization probability curves converge faster ( with typically 3000 trajectories ) than the ones associated with the distributions from the free motion generation ( which require 10000 trajectories to reproduce similar smooth results ) .",

    "[ fig:1 ] are an example of such statistical indicators .",
    "the main drawback of statistical analysis is that it provides very little information on the dynamics and hence on the physical mechanisms .",
    "other methods use not only the locations of trajectories but also their ( linear and nonlinear ) stability properties .",

    "first we study at the dynamics of the helium atom without external field .",
    "this analysis is performed to describe the possible states of the system when the laser field is turned on .",
    "two conclusions can be drawn from this analysis  : first , that the dynamics without the field is very chaotic and second , that the organizing centers are four hyperbolic periodic orbits .",
    "these findings lead to the definition of an inner and an outer electron once the laser field is turned on .      without the electron - electron interaction term @xmath29 in hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian_he ] ) , the resulting hamiltonian is integrable since it is the sum of two independent systems , each with one degree of freedom .",

    "the section in the plane @xmath30 has equation @xmath31 , and in the right panel , the section in the plane @xmath32 of one single electron has the equation @xmath33 .",
    "another representation of phase space is afforded by the linear stability analysis of the trajectories as given by the finite - time lyapunov ( ftl ) exponents  @xcite .",
    "the ftl exponents are obtained by integrating the tangent flow together with the equations of motion for @xmath34  : @xmath35 where eq .",

    "the way to analyze the dynamics using these exponents is to represent maps of ftl exponents as functions of the initial conditions @xmath42 at a fixed time @xmath39 .",

    "[ fig:4 ] . in this respect , they display a dynamical information which complements poincar sections which would highlight the invariant structures and the size of the chaotic zones in phase space .",
    "we consider two types of ftl maps , each associated with a different choice of set of initial conditions , and corresponding to the two poincar sections mentioned above .",
    "the first is in the physical space , i.e.  the @xmath30 plane , where we take initial conditions over the surface of equation  @xmath46 , with  @xmath11 and  @xmath10 bearing the same sign .",
    "for that , we write  @xmath47 and  @xmath48 , and we adapt the parameter  @xmath49 so that the trajectory belongs to the ground state ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "[ fig:4 ] the ftl maps as well as the poincar sections of a few trajectories of hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian_he ] ) without the correlation term .",

    ", it is difficult to infer any globally chaotic property or the existence of stable invariant structures . on the contrary",
    ", the @xmath32 ftl map clearly displays a globally chaotic property by showing fine details of stretching and folding of trajectories which is characteristic of a chaotic behavior .",
    "in particular , this figure does not display any regular elliptic island of stability as it was the case for the uncorrelated motion .",
    "in other words , since the dynamics is very chaotic , poincar sections do not provide any useful information . at first inspection",

    "the key stept is to select an appropriate poincar section .",
