    "this means that , heavy leptons could be detected at future high energy colliders .",
    "we have previously considered the single production of new heavy leptons via string inspired @xmath0 model in @xmath4 collisions @xcite . in this study , we consider both the single and the pair production of heavy leptons separately by using the same model and taking into account the signal and background events at future linear colliders",

    "single production of heavy lepton is feasible up to the center of mass energies of the @xmath3 colliders even with smaller mixing coupling values .",

    "we expect @xmath42 events for 1250 gev ( upper value ) leptons , while no pair event can be observed for @xmath34 , since the pair production cross section is suppressed by the fourth power of mixing couplings .",
