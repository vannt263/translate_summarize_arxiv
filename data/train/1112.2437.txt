    "consider a city where @xmath2 commercial operators ( companies ) and one municipal operator offer wifi internet access to the citizens ( users ) .",
    "the companies charge for their services and offer better rates than the municipal wifi service which however is given gratis .",
    "users with high needs will select one of the companies .",
    "however , if they are charged with high prices , or served with low rates , a portion of them will eventually migrate to the municipal network .",
    "in other words , the municipal service constitutes an alternative choice for the users and therefore sets the minimum requirements which the commercial providers should satisfy .",
    "apparently , the existence of the municipal network affects both the user decisions and the operators pricing policy . in different settings",
    ", the minimum requirement can be an inherent characteristic of the users as for example a lower bound on transmission rate for a particular application , an upper bound on the price they are willing to pay or certain combinations of both of these parameters .",
    "again , the operators can attract the users only if they offer more appealing services and prices .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a general wireless communication services market where a set of _ operators _ , compete to sell their services to a common large pool of _",
    "users_. we assume that users have minimum requirements or alternative options to satisfy their needs which we model by introducing the reservation utility @xmath0 , @xcite .",
    "users select an operator only if the offered service and the charged price ensure utility higher than @xmath0 .",
    "we analyze the users strategy for selecting operator and the price competition among the operators under this constraint .",
    "we find that the market outcome depends on @xmath0 and on the amount of spectrum each operator has at his disposal @xmath1 .",
    "accordingly , we consider the existence of a regulating agency who is interested in affecting the market and enforcing a more desirable outcome , by tuning either @xmath1 or @xmath0 .",
    "for example , consider the municipal wifi provider who is actually able to set @xmath0 and bias the competition among the commercial providers .",
    "this is of crucial importance since in many cases the competition of operators may yield inefficient allocation of the network resources , @xcite or even reduced revenue for them , @xcite .",
    "we introduce a rigorous framework that allows us to analyze the various methods through which the regulator can intervene and affect the market outcome according to his objective .",
    "our model captures many different settings such as a wifi market in a city , a mobile / cell - phone market in a country or even a secondary spectrum market where primary users lease their spectrum to secondary users . in order to make our study more realistic",
    ", we adopt a macroscopic perspective and analyze the interaction of the operators and users in a large time scale , for large population of users , and under limited information .",
    "the operators are not aware of the users specific needs and the latter can not predict in advance the exact level of service they will receive .",
    "each operator has a total resource at his disposal ( e.g. the aggregate service rate ) which is on average equally allocated to his subscribers , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is due to the various network management and load balancing techniques that the operators employ , or because of the specific protocol that is used , @xcite .",
    "each user selects the operator that will provide the optimal combination of service quality and price .",
    "apparently , the decision of each user affects the utility of the other users .",
    "we model this interdependency as an evolutionary game , @xcite the stationary point of which represents the users distribution among the operators and depends on the charged prices .",
    "this gives rise to a non cooperative price competition game among the operators who strive to maximize their profits .",
    "central to our analysis is the concept or the _ neutral operator _",
    "@xmath3 which provides to the users a constant and given utility of @xmath0 units",
    ". the @xmath3 can be a special kind of operator , like the municipal wifi provider in the example above , or it can simply model the user choice to abstain from the market . this way , we can directly calculate how many users are served by the market and how many abstain from it and select @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 allows us to introduce the role of a regulating agency who can intervene and bias the market outcome through the service @xmath0 .",
    "we show that @xmath3 can be used to increase the revenue of the operators or the efficiency of the market . in some cases ,",
    "both of these metrics can be simultaneously improved at a cost which is incurred by the regulator .",
    "alternatively , the outcome of the market can be regulated by changing the amount of spectrum each operator has at his disposal .",
    "different regulating methods give different results and entail different cost for the regulator .",
    "the competition of sellers for attracting buyers has been studied extensively in the context of network economics , @xcite , @xcite , both for the internet and more recently for wireless systems . in many cases , the competition results in undesirable outcome . for example , in @xcite the authors consider an oligopoly communication market and show that it yields inefficient resource allocation for the users . from a different perspective",
    "it is explained in @xcite , that selfish pricing strategies may also decrease the revenue of the sellers - providers . in these cases ,",
    "the strategy of each node ( buyer ) affects the performance of the other nodes by increasing the delay of the services they receive , @xcite ( _ effective cost _ ) or , equivalently , decreasing the resource the provider allocates to them , @xcite ( _ delivered price _ ) .",
    "this equal - resource sharing assumption represents many different access schemes and protocols ( tdma , csma / ca , etc ) , @xcite .",
    "more recently , the competition of operators in wireless services markets has been studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the users can be charged either with a usage - based pricing scheme , @xcite , or on a per - subscription basis , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we adopt the latter approach since it is more representative of the current wireless communication systems .",
    "we assume that users may migrate ( churn ) from one operator to the other , @xcite , and we use evolutionary game theory ( evgt ) to model this process , @xcite .",
    "this allows us to capture many realistic aspects and to analyze the interaction of very large population of users under limited information .",
    "the motivation for using evgt in such systems is very nicely discussed in @xcite . due to the existence of the _ neutral operator _ , the user strategy is updated through a hybrid scheme based on imitation and direct selection of @xmath3 .",
    "we define a new revision protocol to capture this aspect and we derive the respective system dynamic equations .",
    "although the regulation has been discussed in context of networks , @xcite , it remains largely unexplored .",
    "some recent work @xcite , @xcite study how a regulator or an _ intervention device _ may affect a non - cooperative game among a set of players ( e.g. operators ) .",
    "however , these works do not consider hierarchical systems , with large populations and limited information .",
    "our contribution can be summarized as follows : * ( i ) * we model the wireless service market using an evolutionary game where the users employ a new hybrid revision protocol , based both on imitation and direct selection of a specific choice , namely the @xmath3 .",
    "we derive the differential equations that describe the evolution of this system and find the stationary points , * ( ii ) * we define the price competition game for @xmath4 operators and the particular case that users have minimum requirements , or equivalently , alternative choices / offers , * ( iii ) * we prove that this is a potential game and we analytically find the nash equilibria , * ( iv ) * we introduce the concept of the neutral operator who represents the system / state regulator or the minimum users requirement , and * ( v ) * we discuss different regulation methods and analyze their efficacy , implications and the resources that are required for their implementation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ omersec : section2 - system model ]",
    "we introduce the system model and in section [ omersec : section3 - service market dyn ] we analyze the dynamics of the users interaction and find the stationary point of the market",
    ". in section [ omersec : section4 - operators_competition ] we define and solve the price competition game among the operators and in section [ omersec : section5 - regulation ] we discuss the relation between the revenue of the operators and the efficiency of the market and their dependency on the system parameters .",
    "accordingly , we analyze various regulation methods for different regulation objectives and give related numerical examples . we conclude in section [ omersec : section6 - conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a wireless service market ( hereafter referred to as a _ market _ ) with a very large set of users @xmath5 and a set of operators @xmath6 , which is depicted in figure [ omerfig : marketmodel ] .",
    "we assume a time slotted operation .",
    "each user can not be served by more than one operator simultaneously .",
    "however , users can switch in each slot @xmath7 between operators or even they can opt to refrain and not purchase services from anyone of the @xmath4 operators .",
    "the net utility perceived by each user who is served by operator @xmath8 in time slot @xmath7 is : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the users served by this specific operator in slot @xmath7 , @xmath11 the total spectrum at his disposal , and @xmath12 the charged price . in order to describe the market operation",
    "we introduce the users vector @xmath13 , where the @xmath14 component @xmath15 represents the portion of users that have selected operator @xmath16 .",
    "additionally , with @xmath17 we denote the portion of users that have selected neither of the @xmath4 operators .",
    "we assume that the number of users @xmath18 is very large , @xmath19 and therefore the variable @xmath15 is considered continuous . in other words , we assume that there exist a continuum of users partitioned among the different operators .",
    "the function @xmath20 represents the value of the offered service for each user associated with operator @xmath16 .",
    "users are considered homogeneous : all the users served by a certain operator are charged the same price and perceive the same utility .",
    "we consider the following particular valuation function : @xmath21 since @xmath18 is given , we use @xmath22 instead of @xmath10 .",
    "this function has the following desirable properties : * ( i ) * the valuation for each user decreases with the total number of served users by the specific operator due to congestion , * ( ii ) * increases with the amount of available spectrum @xmath11 , and * ( iii ) * it is a concave function and therefore captures the saturation of the user satisfaction as the allocated resource increases , i.e. it satisfies the principle of diminishing marginal returns , @xcite .",
    "a basic assumption in our model is that users served by the same operator are allocated an equal amount of resource .",
    "we want to stress that this assumption captures many different settings in wireline , @xcite , or wireless networks , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "some examples where the equal resource sharing assumption holds are the following :    * * fdma - tdma : * if the operator uses a multiple access scheme like frequency division multiple access ( fdma ) or time division multiple access ( tdma ) , then the equal resource sharing assumption holds by default , @xcite .",
    "the users served by a certain operator receive an equal share of his total available spectrum or an equal time share of the operator s channel . * * csma / ca : * a similar result holds for the carrier sense multiple access scheme with collision avoidance , @xcite , that is used in ieee 802.11 protocols .",
    "users trying to access the channel receive an equal share of it and achieve - on average - the same transmission rate . additionally , as it was shown in @xcite , even if the radio transmitters are controlled by selfish users",
    ", they can achieve this fair resource sharing .",
    "* * random access of multiple channels : * even in more complicated access schemes as in the case , for example , where many different users iteratively select the least congested channel among a set of available channels , it is proved that each user receives asymptotically an equal share of the channel bandwidth , @xcite .    additionally , the macroscopic perspective and the large time scale that we consider in this problem , ensure that spatiotemporal variations in the quality of the offered services will be smoothed out due to load balancing and other similar network management techniques that the operators employ .",
    "therefore , users of each operator are treated in equal terms .",
    "variable @xmath23 represents the portion of users that do not select anyone of the @xmath4 operators .",
    "namely , a user in each time slot @xmath7 is willing to pay operator @xmath16 only if the offered utility @xmath24 is greater than a threshold @xmath25 . if all operators fail to satisfy this minimum requirement then the user abstains from the market and is associated with the _ neutral operator _",
    "@xmath3 , figure [ omerfig : marketmodel ] . in other words",
    ", @xmath3 represents the choice of selecting neither of the @xmath4 operators and receiving utility of @xmath0 units .",
    "technically , as it will be shown in the sequel , the inclusion of @xmath3 affects both the user decision process for selecting operator and the competition among the operators .    from a modeling perspective",
    ", the neutral operator may be used to represent different realistic aspects of the wireless service market .",
    "first , @xmath3 can be an actual operator owned by the state , as the public / municipal wifi provider we considered in the introductory example . in this case , through the gratis @xmath0 service , the state intervenes and regulates the market as we will explain in section [ omersec : section5 - regulation ] .",
    "additionally , @xmath0 can be indirectly imposed by the state ( the regulator ) through certain rules such as the minimum amount of spectrum / rate per user .",
    "finally , it can represent the users reluctancy to pay very high prices for poor qos , similarly to the individual rationality constraint in mechanism design .",
    "we take these realistic aspects into account and moreover , by using @xmath23 , we find precisely how many users are not satisfied by the market of the @xmath4 operators .",
    "unlike the valuation @xmath20 of the service offered by each operator @xmath16 , @xmath0 is considered constant .",
    "when @xmath0 represents users minimum requirements or respective restrictions imposed by regulatory rules , this assumption follows directly and actually is imperative . in case",
    "@xmath0 models the service offered by the neutral operator ( e.g. the municipal wifi network ) , the constant value of @xmath0 means that it is independent of the number of users and hence non - congestible .",
    "we follow this assumption for the following two reasons:*(i ) * @xmath0 is a free of charge service which in general is low and hence can be ensured for a large number of users . *",
    "( ii ) * the state agency ( i.e. the regulator ) who provides @xmath0 , is able to increase his resource in order to ensure a constant value for @xmath0 .",
    "as we will explain in next sections , this latter aspect captures the cost of regulation , i.e. the cost of serving users through the neutral operator .",
    "finally , notice that our model can be easily extended for the case that @xmath0 is a congestible service .",
    "each operator @xmath16 determines the price @xmath26 that he will charge to his clients .",
    "the decisions of the operators are realized in a different time scale than the decisions of the users .",
    "namely , each operator @xmath8 determines his price in the beginning of each time epoch @xmath27 which consists of @xmath28 slots , while users update their operator association decision in each slot .",
    "let us define the price vector @xmath29 and the vector of the @xmath30 prices of operators other than @xmath8 as @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that @xmath28 is large enough so that for each price vector @xmath32 set at the beginning of an epoch , the market of the users reaches a stationary point - if such a point is attainable - during this epoch .",
    "the objective of each operator @xmath16 is to maximize his revenue during each epoch @xmath27 : @xmath33 in these markets there are no service level agreements ( slas ) or any other type of qos guarantees and hence the operators are willing to admit and serve as many users as it is required to achieve their goal .",
    "in order to select the optimal operator that maximizes eq .",
    "( [ omereq : utility_ui ] ) , each user must be aware of all system parameters , i.e. the spectrum @xmath11 , the number of served users @xmath35 and the charged price @xmath12 for each @xmath16",
    ". however , in realistic settings this information will not be available in advance . given these restrictions and the large number of users , we model their interaction and the operator selection process by defining an evolutionary game , @xmath34 , as follows :    * players : the set of the @xmath18 users , @xmath5 . *",
    "strategies : each user selects a certain operator @xmath16 or the neutral operator @xmath3 .",
    "* population state : the users distribution over the @xmath4 operators and the neutral operator , @xmath36 . *",
    "payoff : the user s net utility @xmath37 when he selects operator @xmath16 , or @xmath0 when he selects @xmath3 .    to facilitate our analysis",
    "we make the following assumptions :    * * assumption 1 * : the number of users @xmath18 is very large , @xmath19 and therefore the variable @xmath15 is considered continuous .",
    "* * assumption 2 * : the initial distribution of users over the @xmath4 operators is non zero : @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "it directly follows that @xmath40 .    in the sequel",
    "we explain how each user selects his strategy under this limited information and what is the outcome of this game .",
    "a basic component of every evolutionary game is the _ revision protocol _ , @xcite .",
    "it captures the dynamics of the interaction among the users and describes in detail the process according to which a player iteratively updates his strategy .",
    "there exist many different options for the revision protocol , depending on the modeling assumptions of the specific problem .",
    "these assumptions are mainly related to how sophisticated , informed and rational are the players . on the one extreme , fully rational and informed players update their choices according to a best response strategy like in the typical ( non - evolutionary ) strategic games .",
    "this means that players make a _ direct selection _ of the best available strategy . on the other extreme",
    ", players follow an imitation strategy . in this case a player @xmath41 selects randomly another player @xmath42 and if the utility of the latter is higher , @xmath41 imitates his strategy with a probability that is proportional to the anticipated utility improvement .",
    "this modeling option is suitable for imperfectly informed players , or players with bounded rationality who update their strategy based on a better ( instead of best ) response strategy . between these two extremes , there are many different options .",
    "for example , a player may update his strategy with a _ hybrid _ protocol based partially on imitation and on direct selection , @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we assume that each user updates his strategy by a special type of hybrid revision protocol which is a combination of imitation of other users associated with operators from the set @xmath43 ( market operators ) and direct selection of the neutral operator @xmath3 .",
    "the imitation component captures the lack of information users have at their disposal about the market . on the other hand ,",
    "each user is aware of the exact value of @xmath0 and hence this choice is always available through direct selection .",
    "notice that the considered revision protocol is not a typical hybrid protocol since the direct selection is related only to the selection of @xmath3 and not to the other operators .    in detail",
    ", the proposed revision protocol can be described by the following actions that each user may take in each slot @xmath7 :    1 .",
    "a user associated with an operator @xmath16 , selects randomly another user who is associated with an operator @xmath44 , and if @xmath45 imitates his strategy with a probability that is proportional to the difference @xmath46 .",
    "2 .   a user associated with the neutral operator @xmath3 , selects randomly another user associated with operator @xmath47 and if @xmath48 , imitates his strategy with a probability that is proportional to the difference @xmath49 .",
    "a user associated with operator @xmath16 selects the neutral operator @xmath3 with probability that is proportional to the difference @xmath50 .",
    "options @xmath51 and @xmath52 , stem from the replicator dynamics introduced by taylor and jonker in @xcite and are based on imitation of users with better strategies . on the other hand ,",
    "option @xmath2 is based on direct selection of better strategies , known also as pairwise dynamics , introduced by smith in @xcite .    after defining the revision protocol",
    ", we can calculate the rate at which users switch from one strategy ( operator ) to another strategy ( operator ) .",
    "in particular , the switch rate of users migrating from operator @xmath8 to operator @xmath53 in time slot @xmath7 , is : @xmath54_{+ } \\label{omereq : revisionforoper}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the portion of users already associated with operator @xmath56 . for simplicity",
    ", we express the user utilities as a function with a single argument , the time @xmath7 .",
    "additionally , the users switch rate from operator @xmath8 to neutral operator @xmath3 , is : @xmath57_{+ } \\label{omereq : revisionwithartifoper}\\ ] ] notice the difference between imitation and direct selection @xcite . instead of multiplying the utilities difference with the population @xmath23",
    ", we use a constant multiplier @xmath58 .",
    "this is due to the model assumption that switching to the neutral operator is not accomplished through imitation and hence does not depend on the portion of users already been associated with @xmath3 .",
    "the probabilistic aspect captures the bounded rationality , the inertia of the users and other similar realistic aspects of these markets .",
    "finally , the switch rate of users leaving @xmath3 and returning to the market ( option @xmath52 ) is : @xmath59_{+}\\ ] ]    variables @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 represent the rates at which users migrate from one operator to another , including the neutral operator @xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that if these rates are normalized properly , they can be interpreted as the probabilities with which users update their operator selection strategy .",
    "this approach is discussed in @xcite . in the sequel we use these rates to derive the ordinary differential equations ( ode ) that describe the evolution of the population of users .",
    "the new type of hybrid revision protocol introduced above , results in user market dynamics that can not be expressed with the known differential equations of replicator dynamics or other similar scheme , @xcite . in section [ appendixproof : derivofevolutionarydynamics ] of the appendix",
    "we prove that the mean dynamics of the system are : @xmath63,\\,\\forall i\\in\\mathcal{i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the average utility of the market in each slot @xmath7 .",
    "the user population associated with @xmath3 is : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the subset of operators offering utility @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the subset of operators offering utility @xmath69 , at slot @xmath7 .",
    "the important thing is that despite its different evolution , as we prove in section [ appendixproof : analysisofstationarypoints ] , this system has the same stationary points as the systems that are described by the classical replicator dynamic equations : @xmath70=0,\\,\\forall i\\in\\mathcal{i } \\label{omereq : pi_stationarypoints}\\ ] ] and @xmath71=0 \\label{omereq : p0_stationarypoints}\\ ] ] the user state vector @xmath72 and the respective user utility @xmath73 , @xmath16 , that satisfy these stationary conditions can be summarized in the following @xmath2 cases :    * * case a * : @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath16 .",
    "* * case b * : @xmath74 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with @xmath80 @xmath81,@xmath82 .",
    "* * case c * : @xmath74 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath83 , @xmath82 .",
    "case @xmath84 corresponds to the scenario where all operators offer to their clients net utility which is equal to the value of the service offered by the neutral operator . on the other hand , in case @xmath85 the market operators offer higher utility than the neutral operator and hence all users are served by the market .",
    "finally , in case @xmath86 , the @xmath4 operators offer marginal services , i.e. equal to @xmath0 , but they have attracted all the users .",
    "it is interesting to compare the above results with the wardrop model and the wardrop equilibrium , @xcite .",
    "the market stationary points for * case a * and * case c * satisfy the _ wardrop first principle _ and yield an equilibrium where the available strategy options ( `` operators '' in our problem ) result in equal utility for the players ( `` users '' ) .",
    "however , this does not hold for * case b * where operators other than @xmath3 offer higher utility .",
    "this emerges due to the fact that the alternative option ( or reservation utility ) is non - congestible , i.e. independent of @xmath87 .",
    "the evolutionary game allows us to provide a richer model than the typical wardrop model and more importantly to capture the users interaction and dynamics .    before calculating the stationary point @xmath72 for each case , and in order to facilitate our analysis",
    ", we define the scalar parameter @xmath88 for each operator @xmath16 and the respective vector @xmath89 . as it will be explained in the sequel",
    ", these parameters determine the operators and users interaction and will help us to explain the role of the regulator .",
    "we can find the stationary points for * case a * by using equation @xmath90 and imposing the constraint @xmath75 .",
    "apparently , the state vector @xmath72 depends on the price vector @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , we define the set of all possible * case a * stationary points , @xmath91 , as follows ( see section [ appendixproof : analysisofstationarypoints ] for details ) : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the set of prices for which a stationary point in @xmath91 is attainable , i.e. for which it holds @xmath75 : @xmath94 recall that due to the very large number of users , we consider @xmath95 a continuous variable .",

    "the utility of the users is equal to @xmath0 for the * case a * and * case c * , while for * case b * it depends on @xmath32 .    .wireless service market stationary points . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ omertable : equilibrium ]    in conclusion , @xmath110 is a non - cooperative game of complete information that attains certain pure nash equilibriums ( ne ) which depend on parameters @xmath111 .",
    "it is proved to be a potential game and hence the equilibriums can be reached if @xmath110 is played repeatedly and operators update their strategy by simple best response or other similar utility improvement methods . if @xmath112 parameters are equal , i.e. @xmath113 , then the ne is unique for @xmath114 or @xmath115 . for the case",
    "@xmath116 , the reached equilibrium depends on the initial price vector .",
    "the outcome of the users and operators interaction can be characterized by the following two fundamental criteria : the efficiency of the users market and the total revenue the operators accrue .",
    "we show that both of them depend on parameter @xmath117 and we further explore the impact of @xmath1 and @xmath0 on them .",
    "accordingly , we analyze the problem from a mechanism design perspective and explain how a regulator , as the municipal wifi provider in the introductory example , can bias the market operation ( outcome ) by adjusting the value of @xmath117 . we consider different regulation methods and discuss their implications .",
    "a market is efficient if the users enjoy high utilities in the stationary point .",
    "however , in certain scenarios , the services provided by the @xmath3 may impose an additional cost to the system ( e.g. the cost of the municipal wifi provider is borne by the citizens ) and hence it would be preferable to have all the users served by the @xmath4 operators .",
    "therefore , we use the following two metrics to characterize the efficiency of the market : * ( i ) * the aggregate utility ( @xmath118 ) of users in the stationary point @xmath72 , and * ( ii ) * the cost @xmath119 incurred by the neutral operator @xmath3 for serving the portion @xmath87 of the users . both of these metrics depend on parameter @xmath117 and hence on system parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 .    in detail :    * when @xmath120 , it is @xmath121 , which means that a portion of users @xmath122 selects @xmath3 .",

    "@xmath76 for @xmath127 .",
    "there is no cost for @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath128 .",

    "we present the revenue of two operators ( duopoly ) at the equilibrium , for various initial prices and for @xmath142 . here",

    "we assume that both operators have selected prices @xmath153 .",
    "however , this price vector does not constitute a ne and hence an operator ( e.g. the @xmath143 ) can temporarily increase his revenue by decreasing his price to @xmath154 .",
    "accordingly , the other operator ( @xmath145 ) will react by reducing his price to @xmath155 .",
    "gradually , the competition of the operators will converge to the ne where both of them will set @xmath156 and will have revenue @xmath157 .",
    "interestingly , the revenue of both operators in the equilibrium is lower than their initial revenue when they did not compete .",
    "finally , notice that , unlike the aggregate utility @xmath118 , the revenue of the operators depends only on @xmath158 and not the specific values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "before we proceed , let us summarize the above results :    * if @xmath159 , it is @xmath160 , @xmath127 .",
    "operators receive equal revenue which is * ( i ) * proportional to @xmath1 , * ( ii ) * inversely proportional to @xmath0 and * ( iii ) * independent of the number of users @xmath18 . * if @xmath161 , @xmath162 depends on the initial prices operators select . in the particular case that a single operator @xmath8 sets first his price @xmath12 so as to be @xmath163 , then all operators obtain finally equal revenue @xmath164 . * if @xmath165 , it is @xmath166 .",
    "operators receive equal revenue which is * ( i ) * proportional to @xmath18 , * ( ii ) * independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "since both the market efficiency and the operator revenue depend on @xmath117 and system parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , a regulating agency can act as a _ mechanism designer _ and steer the outcome of the market in a more desirable equilibrium according to his objective .",
    "this can be achieved by determining directly or indirectly ( e.g. through pricing ) the amount of spectrum @xmath1 each operator has at his disposal , or by intervening in the market and setting the value @xmath0 as the example with the municipal wifi internet provider .",
    "this process is depicted in figure [ omerfig : marketregulation2 ] .",
    "first , we highlight the impact of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 on the efficiency metrics .",
    "this is of crucial importance because tuning @xmath1 or @xmath0 has different implications for the regulator and the market .",
    "for example , as it is explained below , the regulator can achieve the same level of market efficiency either by selling more spectrum to operators , e.g. by decreasing the spectrum price , or by allocating more spectrum to the neutral operator :    * _ assume that @xmath0 is fixed_. as the allocated spectrum @xmath1 to each operator increases , aggregate utility @xmath118 remains constant until parameter @xmath117 increases up to @xmath167 .",
    "when @xmath168 , @xmath118 is log - proportional to @xmath1 . also , the cost @xmath136 increases with @xmath1 , as long as @xmath114 , and becomes zero for larger values of @xmath117 .",
    "assume that @xmath1 is fixed_. @xmath118 increases with @xmath0 as long as @xmath169 .",
    "for larger values of @xmath117 , @xmath118 does not depend directly on @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , the cost @xmath136 increases with @xmath0 as long as @xmath114 while for larger values of @xmath117 it becomes zero .",
    "let us now give a specific scenario for regulation .",
    "assume that initially @xmath159 .",
    "hence , a portion of users is not served by anyone of the @xmath4 operators , @xmath170 and all the users receive utility equal to @xmath0 . the regulator can improve the market efficiency , i.e. increase @xmath118 and decrease @xmath136 , by increasing the value of @xmath117 .",
    "this can be achieved either by increasing @xmath1 or decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "let us assume that the regulator selects the first method .",
    "for example , he can change the price of @xmath1 and allow the operators to acquire more spectrum .",
    "if @xmath1 is increased until @xmath171 , then the market stationary point @xmath72 switches to @xmath100 . in this case , all users are served by the market , @xmath78 , but they still receive only marginal utility , @xmath172 .",
    "if the regulator provides even more spectrum @xmath1 to operators so as @xmath173 , then @xmath78 and moreover the users perceive higher utility because @xmath118 increases proportional to @xmath174 , eq .",
    "( [ omereq : sw ] ) . obviously , the improvement in market efficiency comes at the cost ( _ opportunity cost _ ) of the additional spectrum the regulator must provide to operators .    on the other hand , the regulator may prefer to directly intervene in the market through @xmath3 and tune @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 decreases , the value of @xmath175 decreases and users return to the market ( to the @xmath4 operators ) .",
    "the portion of users @xmath175 becomes zero when @xmath171 .",
    "this way , the cost of the regulator @xmath136 decreases ( since @xmath3 serves less users ) but at the same time the aggregate utility , @xmath124 , is also reduced .",
    "namely , @xmath118 decreases linearly with @xmath0 until @xmath176 and remains constant for larger values of @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ omereq : sw ] ) .",
    "again , the decision of the regulator depends on his cost and on the efficiency he wants to achieve . in conclusion ,",
    "depending on they system parameters ( @xmath177 ) the efficiency of the market may be improved either by increasing the resources of operators ( sell more spectrum ) or by rendering highly competitive the services provided by the neutral operator @xmath3 .      as illustrated in table",
    "[ omertable : equilibrium ] , the revenue of the operators increases proportionally to @xmath117 for @xmath178 , and proportionally to @xmath179 for @xmath116 , while it remains constant when @xmath115 .",
    "notice that the revenue , unlike the market efficiency , depends on the value of @xmath117 and not on the specific combination of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "these results are presented in figure [ omerfig : figure4 ] for a market with @xmath180 operators and @xmath181 users . in the upper plot , it is @xmath182 and the regulator increases the value of @xmath117 by increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the aggregate utility is constant and equal to @xmath183 for @xmath184 while it increases proportionally to @xmath174 for @xmath185 .",
    "obviously , increasing the spectrum of operators improves both their revenue and the efficiency of the market .    in the lower plot , the spectrum at the disposal of each operator is constant , @xmath186 , and the regulator increases the value of @xmath117 by decreasing @xmath0 . in this case , the total revenue increases but at the expense of market efficiency .",
    "when @xmath187 $ ] , the aggregate utility @xmath118 is reduced as @xmath0 decreases but for @xmath188 it remains constant .",
    "notice that for very small values of @xmath117 , @xmath118 is large .",
    "however , this desirable result comes at a cost for the regulator .",
    "namely , in this case only a small portion of users are served by the market , while the rest of them select @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the incurred cost @xmath136 for the regulator is high .    another interesting point in figure",
    "[ omerfig : figure4 ] is the following . in the upper subplot , for @xmath182 ,",
    "the total operators revenue is @xmath189 units and the aggregate utility is @xmath190 , achieved by increasing the spectrum @xmath1 until @xmath191 units , which yields @xmath192 . in the lower plot ,",
    "the same total revenue is reached for @xmath186 , and decreasing @xmath0 until @xmath193 units . in this case , the aggregate utility is @xmath194 units .",
    "if , for example , the regulator is interesting only in maximizing the revenue of operators , then he would prefer the first method since it requires less spectrum and lower value for @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper , we studied the operators price competition in a wireless services market where users have a certain reservation utility @xmath0 .",
    "we modeled the users interaction as an evolutionary game and the competition of the operators as a non cooperative game of complete information .",
    "we proved that the latter is a potential game and hence has pure nash equilibriums .",
    "the two games are realized in different time scale but they are interrelated .",
    "additionally , both of them depend on the reservation utility @xmath0 and the amount of spectrum @xmath1 each operator has at his disposal . accordingly",
