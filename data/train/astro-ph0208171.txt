    "tev astronomy is currently one of the most rapidly expanding research areas in astrophysics .",
    "the steadily improving flux sensitivities of the new generation of air erenkov telescope arrays @xcite and their decreasing energy thresholds , provides a growing potential to extend their extragalactic - source list towards intermediate and even low - frequency peaked bl  lac objects ( lbls ) with lower @xmath0 peak frequencies in their broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "detection of such objects at energies @xmath11  100  gev might provide an opportunity to probe the intrinsic high - energy cutoff of their seds since at those energies , @xmath12 absorption due to the intergalactic infrared background is still expected to be negligible at redshifts of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions of the high - energy emission of bl  lac objects on the basis of their emission at lower frequencies @xcite are essential for careful planning of future observations by ground - based vhe @xmath10-ray observatories .",
    "such studies have generally been restricted to considerations of the observed broadband spectral properties of potential candidate sources and have mostly been based on non - simultaneous spectral measurements alone . in this paper",
    ", we point out that such considerations can have very large uncertainties and ambiguities with respect to the predicted vhe emission . the importance and potential scientific return of including detailed variability information in the modeling of hbls has been pointed out by @xcite who have shown the wide variety of correlated x - ray and vhe @xmath10-ray variability patterns which can result in time - dependent synchrotron - self - compton models for blazars . in particular , they have pointed out that combined x - ray spectral and variability information may be sufficient to predict the level of intrinsic tev emission in hbls , even if no direct measurements at gev  tev energies are available . here",
    ", we will demonstrate that similar conclusions hold for lbls , and investigate the example of the radio - selected bl lac object w  comae (= on  231 = 1219 + 285 ; z = 0.102 ) , which is currently on the source list of the stacee and celeste experiments .",
    "its gev  tev source candidacy is based on the fact that w  comae has been detected by the egret instrument on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ at energies above 100  mev , exhibiting a very hard spectrum @xcite . a power - law extrapolation of the average egret 0.1  10  gev flux into the multi - gev  tev range yields a vhe flux well above the current detection threshold of both stacee and celeste ( see fig .",
    "[ sscgraph ] ) . @xcite",
    "also report on the detection of a 27.3  gev photon from this source by egret in april 1993 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite has predicted a tev flux near the detection limit of the whipple air erenkov telescope at the time , based on a proton - blazar model fit to a non - simultaneous broadband spectrum of w  comae .",
    "the source was observed in a multiwavelength campaign in february 1996 , covering the electromagnetic spectrum from ghz radio frequencies to tev energies @xcite .",
    "no tev emission was detected by either whipple or hegra .    while w  comae",
    "is generally observed to exhibit a typical one - sided jet morphology in vlbi images , @xcite report the detection of a weak apparent counter - jet component in 1999.13 , if the brightest jet component with the flattest radio spectrum is identified with the core . such a feature has not been found in any previous or later radio maps of the source .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that it is implausible that this component is actually the emission from the counter - jet .",
    "alternatively , they suggest , e.g. , that it could be due to a small - angle displacement of the jet direction in a general configuration in which the jet is directed at a very small average angle with respect to the line of sight .    the most detailed currently available simultaneous broadband spectrum of w  comae has been measured in may 1998 @xcite and is shown in figs .",

    "there was clear evidence for variability on a @xmath14  hr time scale in the lecs count rate at photon energies of 0.1  4  kev , while no evidence for variability was found in the mecs count rate at 4  10  kev and the pds count rate at 12  100  kev .",
    "a 3  @xmath15 upper limit of 40  % on the short - term variability amplitude in the mecs count rate could be derived in the may 1998 observations @xcite .",
    "the 4 individual spectral points in the egret energy range have been measured in march 1998 , and are not strictly simultaneous to the _ bepposax _ observations .",
    "the egret detection was at low significance ( 2.7  @xmath15 ) , and allowed only a rather crude source localization to within 1.5@xmath16 .",

    "the choice of a very small observing angle implies that the observer is located within the beaming cone of relativistically beamed emission from the emitting region for all values of @xmath46 considered here , and is consistent with the moderate superluminal motion of @xmath47 and the @xcite result concerning the occasional two - sidedness of the radio structure observed in w  comae , as mentioned in  [ intro ] .",

    "the most rapid variability has been observed in soft x - rays , where approximately symmetric flare profiles on a time scale of @xmath14  hr have been seen @xcite .",

    "this motivates our choice of @xmath54  cm , which we adopt throughout this paper .",
    "the assumption that the magnetic field is in approximate equipartition with the emitting electron / positron population allows an independent estimate of the co - moving magnetic field : a power - law population of electrons with spectral index @xmath37 , emitting a synchrotron @xmath0 peak flux of @xmath55  ergs  @xmath6  s@xmath7 at a dimensionless photon energy @xmath56 requires a magnetic field of    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the luminosity distance in units of @xmath59  cm , @xmath60 is the magnetic - field equipartition factor , and @xmath61 is @xmath62 in units of @xmath63  cm . for @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( corresponding to equipartition ) , @xmath67 ( corresponding to a peak frequency in the near infrared ) , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , we find @xmath70  g , which is within a factor of @xmath71 of the values quoted in tab .",

    "the table indicates that different ssc model fits to the optical  x - ray spectrum of w  comae predict levels of vhe emission which differ by a factor of more than 10 .    in a second step ,",
    "we investigate how much our results depend on the ( rather arbitrary ) choice of @xmath82 adopted above . to this aim",

    ", we do not encounter any fundamental problem in finding appropriate model parameters to provide a good fit to the optical  x - ray spectrum of w  comae .",
    "similar to the previous series of fits , the two new model fits predict levels of vhe emission differing by about an order of magnitude .",
    "the fit results are shown as curves no . 6 and 7 in fig .",
    "[ sscgraph ]    fig .",
    "[ sscgraph ] illustrates another very interesting result : although the different ssc model fits predict very different levels of @xmath2  gev emission , they all cut off around 100  gev .",
    "thus , no @xmath9  gev emission is predicted by any of our model fits .",
    "this is related to the high - energy cut - off of the synchrotron component , which is very well constrained by the high - quality x - ray spectrum observed by _",
    "bepposax_. table [ parameters ] indicates that there is a certain degree of anti - correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath36 . as mentioned above , the minimum allowed value for @xmath35 is rather well defined so that we do not have the freedom to choose very low values of @xmath35 in order to attempt to find acceptable fits with very large values of @xmath36 which would be able to produce substantially higher vhe cutoffs .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , a pure ssc model fit to the 1998 sed of w  comae produces a @xmath10-ray spectrum which is incompatible with the egret spectrum if the spectral index resulting from this low - significance detection is to be trusted .",
    "the fact that egret detections of the source during other viewing periods yielded similar spectral shapes in the 0.1  10  gev regime (  [ egret ] ) provides some circumstantial evidence that there might indeed be a separate high - energy emission component producing a spectral bump centered at a peak energy of @xmath91  gev . in the framework of our generic leptonic jet model ,",
    "this can be plausibly related to an external compton component . in fig .",
    "[ blrgraph ] , we illustrate , how the overall spectral shape of our model fit no . 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ sscgraph ] and tab .",
    "[ parameters ] ) changes if an external compton component due to soft photons reprocessed in the broad line region is included in the model .",
    "the radio  hard x - ray emission from the different models remains virtually invariant under the inclusion of the ec component .",
    "the egret spectrum can be very well accomodated assuming a radial thomson depth of our model blr of @xmath92 .",
    "this would raise the predicted @xmath2  gev flux from the model by a factor of @xmath93 compared to the pure ssc model with otherwise identical parameters .",
    "the sharp cut - off of the vhe emission around @xmath3  gev remains unchanged even with the inclusion of the ec component .",
    "the low - energy cut - off of the external - compton component is caused by the sharp cut - off in the electron injection function at @xmath35 .",
    "this cut - off is maintained in the evolving electron distribution throughout the simulation because the radiative cooling time scale for electrons of energy @xmath94 is much longer than the dynamical time scale for the parameters used here .    from this analysis",
    ", we can conclude that pure spectral modeling of the optical  x - ray emission of w  comae is insufficient to make reliable predictions about the expected level of vhe emission at @xmath2  gev from this object . in the next section ,",
    "we illustrate , how the combination of spectral and x - ray variability information can be used to put significantly tighter constraints on the expected level of vhe emission  even without independent information about the @xmath10-ray emission .",
    "apart from the spectral information , the _ bepposax _ x - ray observations of may 1998 revealed variability in the soft band ( 0.1  4  kev ) , dominated by a broad flare with a rise time of @xmath95  hr and a decay time of @xmath14  hr ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) , corresponding to @xmath96  hr and @xmath97  hr in the cosmological rest - frame of the source .",
    "in the hard band ( 4  10  kev ) , no significant variability was detected . because of",
    "the limited photon statistics , local spectral indices or hardness ratios within the soft and hard bands could not be extracted with useful temporal resolution .",
    "however , such information might become available through observations with the new generation of x - ray telescopes , in particular _ xmm - newton _ and _",
    "chandra_. for this reason , we are now investigating generic light curves and spectral variability signatures at x - rays resulting from the different model fits to w  comae presented in the previous section .",
    "to do so , we use a code which is based on the jet radiation transfer code of @xcite and @xcite , but accounts for time - dependent electron acceleration and/or injection throughout the evolution of the emitting region as it moves outward along the jet .",
    "a detailed code description as well as a parameter study for various generic model situations will be presented in @xcite .",
    "the numerical approach is very similar to the one used by @xcite who had investigated the broadband spectral variability features in a pure ssc model for flaring blazars , but our code allows for the additional electron cooling and photon emission from external compton scattering ( both direct accretion - disk photons and accretion - disk emission reprocessed in the broad - line region ) and takes into account @xmath12 absorption intrinsic to the source , including the corresponding pair production .    in order to investigate a generic spectral - variability model for w  comae",
    ", we assume that the electron injection during a flare occurs at a constant rate over one dynamical time scale @xmath98 in the co - moving frame , and then proceeds at a lower rate , corresponding to the quiescent emission outside the flaring episode .",

    "the almost symmetric shape of the observed light curve is clearly not reproduced by the ssc dominated case no .",

    "10 ( with @xmath102 ) .",
    "note , however , that even in this case the bolometric luminosity ( and , consequently , the electron cooling ) is still dominated by the synchrotron component , which may explain the fact that it has only a negligible impact on the low - frequency light curves .    in fig .",
    "[ hic ] , we show tracks in the hardness - intensity diagrams ( monoenergetic flux , normalized to the peak flux , vs. energy spectral index @xmath27 ) , produced in the different model situations . as with the light curves shown in fig .",

    "5 , while the inclusion of an ec component leaves the hardness - intensity tracks virtually unchanged .    in the simulations",
    "above , we have assumed the simplest possible time - dependence of the electron acceleration , namely a step function .",
    "@xcite have also touched on the issue of different intrinsic injection functions , and found the effect on the light curves is only of minor importance , if the total duration of the flare injection event is of the same order of magnitude as the dynamic time scale , and the total injected energy remains unchanged . from this",
    ", we may conclude that our results do not strongly depend on the detailed shape of the injection profile , at least to the degree of accuracy with which the soft x - ray variability could be measured by _ bepposax_.    in summary ,",
    "our modeling results indicate that cooling of the ultrarelativistic electron and/or pair plasma in the jet is synchrotron and/or ec dominated .",
    "the most realistic model parameters therefore seem to be close to the simulations no . 1 or 2 , with a possible moderate contribution due to external compton scattering , depending on whether the observed egret flux from 3eg  j1222 + 2841 is indeed related to w  comae .",
    "consequently , we predict a @xmath2  gev flux from w  comae of @xmath4  ( 0.4  1 )  @xmath5  photons  @xmath6  s@xmath7 with no significant emission at @xmath8  gev . note , however , that our conclusions about the x - ray variability have so far only been based on the soft x - ray light curve measured by _ bepposax_. we strongly suggest that our predictions about the energy - dependent hardness - intensity variability illustrated in fig .",

    "here we use the hadronic synchrotron - proton blazar ( spb- ) model of @xcite to model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of w  comae in may 1998 .    like in the leptonic model the emission region , or `` blob '' , in an agn jet moves",

    "on the other hand , the bepposax lecs + mecs data together with the egret spectrum can be explained by hadronic models ( see models 1 + 2 ) , which however underestimate the flux in the pds energy band by about a factor of 3 .",
    "the non - compatibility of the egret- with the bepposax - data in the modeling procedure might be caused by their non - simultaneity and the poor significance of the egret - detection .",

    "it showed the low - energy ( synchrotron ) component extending out to @xmath1  kev , exhibiting significant variability on time scales of @xmath154  hr , and the onset of the high - energy component beyond @xmath1  kev , with no evidence for short - term variability .",
    "the sed was supplemented by simultaneous radio and optical flux measurements as well as a weak egret detection in march 1998 , i. e. about 2 months before the bepposax spectrum was taken .",
    "we have done a careful re - analysis of all available egret pointings on w  comae , and confirmed that the source exhibited an unusually hard gev spectrum during the march 1998 observation , with a photon spectral index of @xmath155 .",

    "\\(4 ) in order to reproduce the march 1998 egret spectrum together with the may 1998 bepposax spectrum , an external compton component is required .",
    "such fits result in @xmath2  gev fluxes of @xmath158  photons  @xmath6  s@xmath7 , and a strong cutoff at @xmath159  gev , as in the case of ssc dominated models .",

    "they result in higher @xmath2  gev fluxes of @xmath162  photons  @xmath6  s@xmath7 , but weaker tev fluxes of @xmath163  photons  @xmath6  s@xmath7 . in this case",
    ", stacee and celeste may be able to get a weak detection of the source , and it would still be a promising candidate for detection by the future veritas array .",
