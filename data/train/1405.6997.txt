    "a wormhole can be defined as a tunnel which can joint two universes @xcite . since general relativity",
    "does not preclude the existence of ( traversable ) wormholes , a large number of papers have been written which clarify , support , or contradict much of the research about wormholes .",
    "morris and thorne @xcite have shown that in order to construct a traversable wormhole , one needs to have extraordinary material , denoted as exotic matter .",
    "exotic matter can guarantee the flare - out condition of the wormhole at its throat .    unlike the classical form of matter @xcite",
    ", it is believed that the exotic matter violates the well - known energy conditions such as the null energy conditions ( nec ) , weak energy conditions ( wec ) , strong energy conditions ( sec ) and dominant energy conditions ( dec ) .",
    "one of the open questions about the exotic matter is that if it can be formed in macroscopic quantities or not . we should note that these energy conditions are violated by certain states of quantum fields , amongst which we may refer to the casimir energy , hawking evaporation , and vacuum polarization @xcite",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that one of the effective causes of the ( late time ) cosmic acceleration is an exotic fluid @xcite .",
    "hence , it will be motivated to study wormhole solutions , at least geometrically .",
    "traversable wormholes in the dvali - gabadadze - porrati theory with cylindrical symmetry has been studied in ref .",
    "higher dimensional lorentzian wormholes have been analyzed by several authors @xcite . moreover ,",
    "wormhole solutions of higher derivative gravity with linear and nonlinear maxwell fields have been considered in @xcite . for other kinds of wormhole solutions ,",
    "we refer the reader to refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "many authors have extensively considered the nonlinear electrodynamics and used their results to explain some physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "a charged system whose performance can not be described by the linear equations may be characterized with nonlinear electrodynamics . from mathematical point of view , since maxwell equations originated from the empirical nature , we can consider a general nonlinear theory of electrodynamics and state that the maxwell fields , are only approximations of nonlinear electrodynamics , which the approximation breaks down for the small distances . from physical viewpoint ,",
    "generalizations of maxwell theory to nonlinear electrodynamics were introduced to eliminate infinite quantities in theoretical analysis of the electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "in addition , one may find some various limitations of the linear electrodynamics in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , we take into account new classes of nonlinear electrodynamics , such as born - infeld ( bi ) like @xcite and power - maxwell invariant ( pmi ) @xcite nonlinear electrodynamics , in order to obtain new analytical solutions in einstein and higher derivative gravity .    motivated above , in this paper we look for the analytical magnetic horizonless solutions of einstein gravity with nonlinear maxwell source .",
    "properties of the solutions will be investigated .",
    "the field equations of einstein gravity with an arbitrary @xmath0 gauge field as a source , may be written as@xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the einstein tensor , @xmath4 denotes the four dimensional negative cosmological constant , @xmath5 is an arbitrary function of the closed @xmath6-form maxwell invariant @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in addition to pmi and bi theories , in this paper , we take into account the recently proposed bi - like models @xcite , which we called them as exponential form of nonlinear electrodynamics theory ( ene ) and logarithmic form of nonlinear electrodynamics theory ( lne ) , whose lagrangians are @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two nonlinearity parameters . expanding the mentioned lagrangians near the linear maxwell case ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , one can obtain@xmath14 where maxwell lagrangian @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath6 and @xmath17 for lne , bi and ene branches , respectively .",
    "investigation of the effects of the higher derivative corrections to the gauge field seems to be an interesting phenomenon .",
    "these nonlinear electrodynamics sources have different effects on the physical properties of the solutions .",
    "for example in black hole framework , these nonlinearities may change the electric potential , temperature , horizon geometry , energy density distribution and also asymptotic behavior of the solutions . in",
    "what follows , we study the effects of nonlinearity on the magnetic solutions .    motivated by the fact that we are looking for the horizonless magnetic solution ( instead of electric one ) , one can start with the following @xmath18-dimensional spacetime @xmath19where @xmath20 is a constant and will be fixed later .",
    "we should note that , because of the periodic nature of @xmath21 , one can obtain the presented metric ( [ staticmetric ] ) with _ local _ transformations @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the horizon - flat schwarzschild metric , @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , metric ( staticmetric ) may be _ locally _ mapped to schwarzschild spacetime , but not _",
    "globally_. considering the mentioned local transformation , one can find that the nonzero component of the gauge potential is @xmath25@xmath26where @xmath27 is an arbitrary function of @xmath28 .",

    "in addition , it is desired to note that rotating solutions have no horizon and curvature singularity .",
    "moreover , it is worth noting that besides the magnetic field along the @xmath21 coordinate , there is also a radial electric field ( @xmath96 ) and therefore , unlike the static case , the rotating wormhole has a nonzero electric charge which is proportional to the rotation parameter .",

    "transformations @xmath113 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is notable that because of the periodic nature of @xmath114 , the mentioned transformations can not be global .",
    "we considered four forms of nonlinear electrodynamics , namely pmi , bi , ene and lne theories , whose asymptotic behavior leads to maxwell theory .",
    "we investigated the effect of nonlinearity parameter on the electromagnetic field and found that for pmi branch , if one reduces the nonlinearity parameter @xmath10 , then the electromagnetic field diverges near the origin more rapidly and for large distances it goes to zero more quickly .",
