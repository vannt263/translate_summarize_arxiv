    "@xcite have been investigated already . as detailed below however , for the particular case of magnetic adatoms on graphene",
    "some additional features emerge . + the problem of adatoms on graphene was treated within the hatree - fock approximation @xcite .",
    "this is only valid at temperatures @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the kondo temperature .",

    "@xcite arrives at a two - channel kondo in graphene due to the _ valley degeneracy _ of the dirac electrons leading to an over - screening and thus to a non - fermi - liquid - like ground state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we conducted a detailed symmetry group analysis to clarify the appropriate physical model and highlighted the various relevant symmetries that are realized depending on whether ( a ) the adatom is above one carbon atom or ( b ) this atom is in the center of the honeycomb .",

    "b we found generally a multi - channel , multi - flavor kondo model . while for a we inferred a one - channel , two - flavor behavior . to identify the correct starting hamiltonian",
    "a symmetry analysis is imperative .",
    "for example , the detailed symmetry analysis in @xcite for the a and b cases yields that the realized symmetry groups are @xmath5 and @xmath6 point groups . to be consistent with these symmetries ,",
    "the eigenstates for pure graphene at dirac points should be recombined as to reflect the modifications imparted by the impurity . as a consequence ,",
    "a single half spin with zero orbital angular momentum is _ decoupled _ from graphene in case b ( in contrast ref . ) .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the situation a and consider a two - flavor anderson model with a relativistic dispersion relation .",
    "therefore , the effect of the gate voltage can be studied in a wide spectrum since the charge fluctuations are already taken into account @xcite .",
    "we introduce a geometrical picture in form of a winding number ( wn ) and a degree of a map , to analyze the occupation and the phase shift .",
    "it is shown that the occupation takes on the values 0 or 1 when the bare level is respectively above or below the fermi energy at half - filling . in the presence of a gate voltage ,",
    "our analytical and the numerical calculations show that the state remains stable only when the edge of the broadened impurity level touches the fermi energy where a nonzero susceptibility occurs .",

    "when lowering the gate voltage below the dirac point , the occupation decreases . to know how fast the velocity of variation can be ,",
    "we write explicitly @xmath139 when @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) , the ldos develops a delta function at the virtual impurity level .",
    "this is the case of half - filling .",
    "therefore , if the virtual level is below the fermi energy and a gate voltage is applied to drive the system away from the half - filling regime , the vanishing ldos is manifested as a vanishing velocity of the occupation with the gate voltage , unless the fermi level touches the virtual impurity energy .",

    "when the gate voltage is apart from the virtual level , @xmath32 decreases .",
    "this can also be observed in fig .",
    "in summary , we investigated the anderson model for a magnetic adatom above one carbon atom of one monolayer of graphene .",
    "we utilized a topological method , i.e. a degree of a map and a winding number , to analyze the occupation of the impurity and the phase shift .",
    "it is found that the phase shift is accelerated by the relativistic dispersion of graphene to complete one winding or zero winding when the impurity level is respectively below or above the fermi energy at half - filling .",
    "the occupation varies dramatically from 1 ( full occupation of the impurity ) in a narrow range giving rise to a peak in the zero field susceptibility .",
