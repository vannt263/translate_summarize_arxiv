    "the ising model is a prototype of a statistical mechanical model for studying order - disorder transitions .",
    "it is also the first statistical model which has led to exact solution in one and two dimensions . since its inception@xcite",
    "this model has triggered an intense effort in investigation of other models resulting in an extensive literature on the subject @xcite .",
    "there are now a large library of statistical and quantum mechanical models , differing in their degrees of freedom , interaction type , the type and dimensions of lattices , and of course methods of solution @xcite .",
    "there are also models which can be called integrable , meaning that they allow sufficient number of conserved quantities , leading to a full determination of their spectra and other observable quantities . among the well - known classical models",
    ", we can mention particularly the @xmath0-state potts model @xcite , which is the simplest generalization of the ising model in that the degrees of freedom take @xmath0 instead of two different values and interact according to the hamiltonian [ hpot ] h=-_i , j ( s_i , s_j ) , where @xmath1 means that interactions are between nearest neighbors and @xmath2 takes @xmath0 different values .",
    "this is a classical model in that every configuration of the so - called spin variables @xmath2 is an energy eigenstate .",
    "the importance of this model , like ising model , is that it can be mapped to many other important models in science , i.e. the famous four - color problem in the case of potts model , @xcite .",
    "the ising model has a @xmath3 symmetry , meaning that the configurations @xmath4 and @xmath5 both have the same energy . ] in the potts model , this symmetry has been elevated to the @xmath6 group , where now due to the form of the hamiltonian ( [ hpot ] ) , one can shift all the spin variables by any integer value @xmath7 $ ] and the energy remains the same . this symmetry can be seen in a better way if we use an identity and write the local energy term as ( s , s)=_n=0^d-1 ^ns^-ns , where @xmath8 is a @xmath9th root of unity . + it is the purpose of this work to generalize the potts and indeed ising model to the case where the symmetry group is a finite ( non - abelian ) group .",
    "such a model , if properly defined will certainly have a very rich structure and will certainly deepen and widen our perspective of exactly solvable models of statistical mechanics and integrable models .",
    "moreover it has the potential of enriching our knowledge of order - disorder transitions in statistical mechanics .",
    "of course the model as defined now is mainly of theoretical interest and it may be difficult to make concrete connections with specific physical problems .",
    "we only hope with hindsight and in view of the experience with other more or less abstract models in statistical mechanics like the face models and vertex models @xcite , this new model will also find a proper place in the library of exactly solvable models , possibly with new applications in the future .",
    "+ we will focus our attention to a one dimensional lattice and show that such a natural generalization is indeed possible and will define the non - abelian potts model .",
    "we determine the full spectrum and show that the ground states and indeed many of the excited states of this model are entangled .",
    "we will determine the amount of this entanglement both for a single site and for a block of finite length .",
    "we also determine the entanglement between two different sites of the lattice . in this sense",
    "the model is a quantum mechanical model , in contrast to classical models where there is no entanglement in their energy eigenstates .",
    "it turns our that the properties of irredudcible representations play an important role in the nature of the spectrum and its entanglement properties .",
    "we will also calculate the partition function of the model in two different ways , that is we follow an algebraic approach where we calculate the trace of the thermal state and a combinatorial approach where we also count the degeneracy of all energy levels .",
    "the results of the two approaches , which correspond respectively to the high and low temperature expansions , agree as they should . in all aspects",
    "the results pertaining to this model reduce to the potts model when the symmetry group @xmath10 reduces to the abelian group @xmath6 .",
    "+ the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ pre ] we review the preliminary material from theory of finite groups and their representations . in section [ model ] , we define the non - abelian model on a one dimensional lattice , which as we see , is a special case of the kitaev quantum double model @xcite . in two dimensions this correspondence in no longer true , since as is well known the kitaev model entails four - body interactions while our model entails two - body interactions , as it should as a generalization of potts model .",
    "in fact generalization of the potts model to two dimensions is a non - trivial problem as we will discuss in the discussion . in section [ spec ]",
    "we derive the ground states and determine their entanglement properties , and in section [ excited states ] we determine all the excited states , hence the full spectrum . in section [ part ] , we calculate the partition function in closed form , by summing up the terms in both high and low temperature expansions . in all our study",
    "we make contact with the simpler and special case where the group we are considering is the abelian group @xmath6 , and the model is the d - state potts model .",
    "let @xmath10 be a finite group of size @xmath11 .",
    "two elements @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the group @xmath10 are said to be conjugate if there is a @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 .",

    "the significance of characters of irreducible representations is that they are orthonormal and complete in the sense that if we define the @xmath17 dimensional formal vectors @xmath37 , where @xmath38 s form a computational basis , then these new vectors form a complete orthonormal basis .",

    "the eigenvectors of @xmath62 are easily found    [ dstates ] |d^s:=_j=0^d-1 ^-js|j , x|d^s=^s|d^s .",

    "in order to find the ground states of the hamiltonian [ hamiltonian ] , we first consider the potts model which will act as a guideline for the more complicated non - abelian case . as equation",
    "[ pottsdelta ] indicates , the ground state of the potts model is when all the labels @xmath2 are equal to each other , so there are @xmath0 different ground states , namely     @xmath70 in [ dstates ] , we can rewrite this as |^s=_j_1 , j_2 , j_n^-j_1s^-j_2s^-j_ns|j_1 , j_2,j_n .",
    "this can be written as a matrix product state ( mps ) as |^s=_j_1 , j_2 , j_n^s(j_1 , j_2 , j_n)|j_1 , j_2,j_n , where [ mpspotts ] ^s(j_1 , j_2 , j_n)= ( d^s(j_1)d^s(j_2)d^s(j_n ) ) , in which @xmath71 is the @xmath72 representation of element @xmath73 .",
    "+ we now go on to consider the spectrum of the non - abelian case .",
    "motivated by the mps representation of the abelian ( potts ) model in [ mpspotts ] , we form the following states : |^&:= & ( d^(g_1)d^(g_2)d^(g_n))|g_1 , g_2 , g_n&=&^(g_1g_2g_n)|g_1 , g_2 , g_n , where a sum over all group elements @xmath74 is implied .",
    "here @xmath75 is a normalization factor and @xmath76 is the matrix of @xmath63 in the irreducible representation @xmath19 .",

    "therefore for each irreducible representation of the group we find one ground state .",
    "thus the ground state is @xmath17-fold degenerate , where @xmath17 is the number of in - equivalent irreducible representations , or equivalently the number of conjugacy classes . to find the normalization",

    "note that in contrast to the abelian case , the ground states are generally entangled .",
    "moreover consider the following string operators    t^=_g_1 , g_2 , g_n ^(g_1g_2g_n ) |g_1 , g_2 , g_ng_1 , g_2 , g_n| .",
    "we may ask what is the effect of this string operator on a given ground state . in view of the relation ( [ chichi ] ) , it turns out that t^|^=_f^,_|^ , implying that the ground space carries a representation of the fusion algebra of the group representation .",
    "+          we now study the entanglement properties of the ground states .",
    "first we determine how much a given site is entangled with the rest of the lattice , when the whole system is in a given ground state .",
    "then we calculate the entanglement of a given block of length @xmath83 .",

    "+ these results are proved in appendix a.",
    "using the conventions of figure [ contraction ] and the form of the ground state in [ myground ] , we can graphically depict a ground state as in figure [ gsfig ] .",
    "this is again a generalization of the abelian potts model , where all the sites have been colored by one single color , here a color represents a label of an irreducible representation .",
    "each line between two bulbs means that the two adjacent indices of the matrices have been contracted ( i.e. made equal and summed over ) . to obtain the excited states of [ hamiltonian ] , consider now a cut in such a configuration as shown in figure [ exs ] .",
    "we will see that these cuts which separate connected regions of different colors ( i.e. labels of irreducible representations ) produce excited states . to prove this we remind the reader that local hamiltonians , being projectors , have eigenvalues only equal to @xmath55 or @xmath56 , therefore the exited states are those in which one or more of the vertex operators have @xmath55 eigenvalue",
    ". therefore we want to find states which are common eigenstates of all the local hamiltonians where one or more of these local hamiltonians have zero eigenvalues . to proceed , consider local states like @xmath88 .",
    "we first obtain the action of left and right operators on these states , which is easily verified to be as follows : [ l ] l(h)|d^_m , n= d^_m , p(h^-1)|d^_p , n    and    [ r ] r(h)|d^_m , n= |d^_m , pd^_p , n(h ) where summation over repeated latin indices are implied . from these two relations",
    "we find the action of @xmath52 on the two neighboring elementary states , @xmath89 .",

    "q_i+1 = |d^_m , r_i ( _ g d^_r , n(g)d^_p , s(g^-1))|d^_s , q_i+1 .    using the orthonormality relation [ orthonormality ] , we find [ local action ] h_i|d^_m , n_i|d^_p , q_i+1 = _ n , p^,_r|d^_m , r_i|d^_r , q_i+1 . let us first consider the special case @xmath90 , where we have : [ exs1 ] h_i|d^_m , n_i|d^_p , q_i+1 = 0 .     and @xmath91 are different .",
    "c ) an excited state of the kind [ exs3 ] , where both the colors and matrix indices are the same . ]    this means that if the two colors @xmath92 and @xmath93 on the two sides of the cut are different , then the local hamiltonian @xmath52 annihilates the state and so the energy is raised by one unit .",
    "this kind of excited state is depicted in figure [ exs]a .",
    "another special case is when the two colors ( i.e. representation labels ) are the same , but the middle indices are different : [ exs2 ] h_i|d^_m , n_i| d^_p , q_i+1 = 0 np , these kinds of excited states are depicted in figure [ exs]b .",
    "finally we learn from [ local action ] that if @xmath94 and @xmath95 , then the right hand side of [ local action ] , although non - zero , is independent of @xmath96 , this means that for any two matrix indices @xmath97 [ exs3 ] h_i(|d^_m , n_i|d^_n , q_i+1-|d^_m , p_i|d^_p , q_i+1 ) = 0 .",
    "hence the third kind of excitations are depicted as in figure [ exs]c .    the number of these new kinds of excitations for a single cut in @xmath84 which are independent is @xmath98 .",
    "using the simple notation @xmath99 for brevity , they can be chosen to be @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) or if we want to make them orthogonal we can choose them to be @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and so on which are obviously orthogonal .",
    "note that if we form their uniform summation as @xmath105 we will get a state whose eigenvalue for @xmath52 is @xmath56 , which is not an excitation any more .",
    "+ all the excited states are derived by inserting one or more of these different kinds of cuts or excitations in a given ground state .",
    "this again generalizes a feature of the potts model , where only one type of cut exists which separates two different values of spins or colors . in the non - abelian case , where the representations are not one dimensional , the domain walls are more complex .",
    "they are designated by a pair of indices @xmath48 and @xmath91 .",
    "this completes our analysis of the spectrum of the non - abelian potts model .",
    "in this section we calculate the partition function which captures the statistical properties of the model .",
    "we follow two different approaches for calculating the partition function , an algebraic approach in which we calculate the trace of @xmath106 and a combinatorial approach in which we count the number of excited states of any given energy .",
    "the two approaches correspond respectively to high and low temperature expansions .",
    "the reason for this correspondence will be made clear in the derivations .",
    "since the local hamiltonians commute with each other we have z_(g)= e^-h = _ i=1^n e^h_i . noting that the local hamiltonians are projectors @xmath53 ,",
    "we can write the exponentials in the following linear form z_(g)= , where @xmath107 . this parameter , which for high temperatures is small and for @xmath108 approaches @xmath55 , will act as an expansion parameter . at high temperatures",
    "the first few terms of the expansion will be a good approximation of the partition function .",
    "however in the present case , we can exactly determine the partition function by calculating all the terms .",
    "we can write z_(g ) = _ n=0^n ^n z^(n)_(g ) , where @xmath109 is the trace of product of @xmath96 local hamiltonians . in appendix",
    "b we prove that    @xmath110 and @xmath111 . using these two results",
    ", we obtain the exact form of the partition function to be [ zg ] z_(g)= ( e^-1+|g|)^n + ( e^-1)^n(k-1 ) .",
    "it is instructive to first consider the abelian potts model .",
    "this will then teach us how to go about the non - abelian case . in the limit @xmath112",
    ", only the ground states contribute to the partition functions . at very low temperatures both the ground states and the low lying excited states",
    "contribute to the partition function .",
    "as we will see the low lying states corresponds to few domain walls in the configuration of spins .",
    "as the temperature rises more domain walls contribute and the low temperature expansion necessitates the counting of contribution of various configurations of domain walls . again in the present context , we can sum all the contributions exactly and obviously the result should be equal to that of the high - temperature expansion .    more precisely , we note that the ground state energy of the abelian potts model is equal to @xmath113 ( when all the spins are the same , or when all the spins are colored by one single color ) and the degeneracy of the ground state is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "coming to the excited states , for each neighboring pair where the two labels @xmath2 and @xmath114 are unequal , i.e. for each domain wall , an excited state is created .",
    "so for @xmath115 domain walls , the energy will be @xmath116 .",
    "the degeneracy of this energy is then equal to the total number of different configurations with @xmath115 domain walls .",
    "this degeneracy comes from the different positions of the @xmath115 walls and the different possible spin configurations ( which we call colors ) for each configuration of walls .",
    "the first factor is easy to calculate . with a periodic boundary condition ,",
    "it is simply given by @xmath117 .",
    "note that @xmath115 should be greater than @xmath56 , since in a periodic lattice , there can not be one single wall .",
    "calculation of the second factor , which we denote by @xmath118 , is done as follows .",
    "consider figure [ walls ] which shows @xmath115 different domains , separated by @xmath115 walls .",
    "for domain @xmath56 we have @xmath0 colors to choose . for the second domain",
    "we are left with @xmath119 walls , since the color of this domain has to be different from the first one . for the third domain we have again @xmath119 choices , since the color of this domain has to be different from the second one .",
    "so going around the circle and coming to the last domain @xmath115 we have @xmath120 different choices of colors , but in so counting , we have over - counted the number of colors , since the color of the last region @xmath115 should be different from that of region @xmath56 .",
    "the number of such configurations is simply @xmath121 , since in this case the two domains @xmath115 and @xmath56 merge into one single domain .",
    "thus we arrive at the recursion relation [ rr ] c_k(d ) = d ( d-1)^k-1 - c_k-1(d ) , c_0(d ) = d , the solution of which is [ cd ] c_k(d)=(d-1)^k+(d-1)(-1)^k .",
    "therefore the degree of degeneracy of each energy level @xmath122 is given by , leading to the partition function of the @xmath9 level potts model z _ ( ) = _",
    "k=0^n e^(n - k ) nk = ( e^-1+d)^n + ( e^-1)^n(d-1 ) .",
    "( for abelian group ) is characterized by the position of the walls and different possible colors . for a configuration with @xmath115 fixed walls ,",
    "there are @xmath123 different eigenstates as given in [ cd ] . ]",
    "we now go on to the quantum case . here",
    "the structure or the labels of a domain wall is more complex , since as in figure [ circle ] , each domain is characterized not only by a color ( a representation label @xmath124 ) but also by two matrix indices @xmath48 and @xmath91 . consider the first domain in figure [ circle ] .",
    "the total number of choices for this domain is thus @xmath125 .",
    "what is the number of possible choices for the next domain ? from the structure of excited states in [ exs1 ] , [ exs2 ] and [ exs3 ] , we see that from all the combinations of labels for this wall , only one combination does nt lead to an excitation at the position of the wall , hence there are @xmath126 possible choices for this second domain .",
    "the rest of reasoning is exactly the same as for the abelian case , namely we again have the same recursion relation as in [ rr ] , but with a different initial condition : c_k(g ) = |g| ( |g|-1)^k-1 - c_k-1(g ) , c_0(g ) = k , where we remind the reader that @xmath17 is the number of different irreducible representations or the number of conjugacy classes .",
    "this leads to [ cg ] c_k(g ) = ( |g|-1)^k + ( -1)^k ( k-1 ) , and @xmath127 $ ] and finally to the partition function [ pg ] z_(g)= ( e^-1+|g|)^n + ( e^-1)^n(k-1 ) , in accordance with [ zg ] .",

    "we believe that there are many avenues of research which are opened by this study . here",
    "are a few examples : + i ) the definition of the model on 2d lattices remains to be done .",
    "although in one dimensional lattices the local hamiltonian [ localh ] is the same as the one pertaining to the vertex operators of the quantum double model of kitaev @xcite , one can not simply carry this to 2d lattices since it would lead to a four - body interaction , while a natural generalization of the potts model should include two - body interactions",
    ". it may still be the case that a 2d model with two - body interaction as we have defined , is solvable , in the sense that its ground state and low - lying states can be determined in closed form , although in 2d lattice not all the local hamiltonians will commute with each other anymore .",
    "if this is the case , then the structure of the 2d model will be even more interesting and challenging to determine .",
    "one may even be able to establish a duality relation between the high and low temperature expansions in this case which will then enable one to determine the critical point without an exact solution . to find an exact solution for the 2d case",
    ", the first step may be to define the model on a one - dimensional ladder , where despite the incommutability of the operators , there is still some simplicity in the geometry of the lattice .",
    "this has already been exploited to find the explicit form of the full spectrum of the kitaev model on spin ladders @xcite .",
    "+ ii ) one can also generalize this to lie groups on discrete lattices , or to lie groups on the real line , where a suitable definition of the model hamiltonian should be made . in view of the matrix product structure of the ground states",
    ", it may be the case that the generalization of matrix product formalism for quantum field theories as developed in @xcite will be a natural framework for studying this type of generalization .",
    "+ iii ) one can add terms which pertain to an external magnetic field in the ising model . in the same way that adding an external transverse field to the ising model leads to a rich many - body system which undergoes a quantum phase transition , this may also happen for the non - abelian potts model .",
    "in such case , one anticipates that the solution will be highly non - trivial and technical , if an exact solution exists at all .",
    "moreover the meaning of transversality of the external field should also be clarified in this case .",
    "+ iv ) it will also be interesting to study possible phase transitions between this type of order and other possibly topological orders in models where suitable interaction terms are added to the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "+ v ) finally it will be interesting to investigate the relation between this 1d quantum mechanical system and the 2d classical model . once",
    "a 2d classical possibly exactly solvable model is at hand , one can obtain the transfer matrix which represents a 1d quantum mechanical model . in the present case ,",
