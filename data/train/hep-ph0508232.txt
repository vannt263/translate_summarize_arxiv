    "these lectures deal with the description of hadronic scattering at high energies , and more specifically with the evolution of the scattering matrix with energy@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . it has been a very lively and active field for the last 10 years@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and especially lately",
    "there has been a new burst of activity .",
    "the latest developments are related to what is sometimes called pomeron loops@xcite , or fluctuations@xcite or alternatively saturation effects in the projectile wave function@xcite .",
    "it is the last characterization that is most suited to the nature of these lectures . somehow , although the physical underpinning of the low x ( or high energy ) evolution is the understanding how hadronic wave functions evolve with energy , the language of the wave function is not frequently used in this context .",
    "i believe that one can learn a lot by dealing directly with the wave function , since it contains all the nontrivial information there is to have , so my heart goes out to the wave function .",
    "i have therefore decided for these lectures to adhere to its point of view on life , the universe and everything , and as a small part of everything , to show how to think about the evolution and derive the evolution equation from this perspective .",
    "the high energy evolution in its latest incarnation became more or less synonymous with saturation .",
    "why is it interesting to study high energy evolution ?",
    "one obvious answer is of course that there is an experimental drive to understand the high energy regime .",
    "the resurgence of interest in this topic in the 90 s was firmly triggered by the dis data from hera , which extended experimental reach to @xmath0 .",
    "the striking observation there was that the at low @xmath1 ( high energy ) the number of gluons in the proton shoots up very fast ( about 20 gluons at @xmath2 gev , @xmath3 ) .",
    "how and why does this number grow so fast ?",
    "there is still no definitive answer to this question , in the sense that there are more than one fits to hera data , some based on saturation@xcite and some not@xcite , and it is strictly speaking not possible to differentiate between the physical mechanisms involved on this basis . nowadays this motivation is still there and is perhaps even stronger , since lhc is hopefully coming on line soon .",
    "there much larger numbers of gluons will be created in energetic p - p collisions .",
    "another motivation comes from rhic . although the energies there are not extremely large , due to the fact that the colliding objects are nuclei the effects of the evolution are expected to appear much sooner .",
    "it may well be that large gluon densities are at work there .",
    "some features of the data are at least qualitatively described by the saturation models@xcite , which are based in some aspects on low x evolution@xcite . and finally , pb - pb collisions at lhc will lead to even higher gluon densities .",
    "true as it may be , at the moment the high energy evolution and saturation physics can not claim firmly that it is of phenomenological relevance . for me personally",
    "the more appealing side of this field is that the physics is of fundamental theoretical interest .",
    "we all know that qcd is nonperturbative in the infrared .",
    "masses , decay widths , elastic scattering cross sections can not be obtained without recourse to nonperturbative physics .",
    "but in the ultraviolet the theory is perturbative .",
    "quarks and gluons when probed on a short distance and time scales behave as if they are almost free and thus some physical processes can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "the prime example of this is dis .",
    "electron scatters off a nucleon with large ( space like ) momentum transfer @xmath4 . a simple picture of this process is given by the parton model .",
    "= 11.7 cm    the proton comes in with momentum @xmath5 in the @xmath6 direction and is hit by a space like photon ( emitted off the incoming electron ) . by measuring the outgoing electron one has access to two kinematical variables , the energy transfer from the electron to the hadronic system , and the scattering angle of the electron .",
    "the two lorentz scalar quantities which encode this information are @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the parton model is formulated in the infinite momentum frame of the proton , where the four momenta of the proton and the virtual photon involved in the collision are @xmath9 @xmath10^{1/2},0)\\ ] ] the energy of the colliding @xmath11 system is @xmath12 - at small @xmath1 obviously @xmath13 , hence small @xmath1 limit is the same as large energy limit in this case .",
    "the physical picture of the parton model is simple . in the frame",
    "we have chosen , the photon is a very small probe of transverse size @xmath14 .",
    "what does it see when it hits the proton ?",
    "there is of course a lot of stuff inside the proton , which is mainly soft muck .",
    "but a small probe does not see this - it whizzes through the muck unless it strikes something hard .",
    "that is to say , it only scatters off the proton if it encounters another small object of roughly the same size as itself .",
    "the object in this case of course must be a quark , since only quarks are charged and interact with the photon .",
    "the scattering event itself therefore is a short distance process which also happens very quickly in time , with the relevant distance - time scale of order @xmath15 . at large @xmath7",
    "this is perturbative .",
    "this short distance processes are described perturbatively , but such hard fluctuations over the soft background are very rare , thus the cross section is small . in other words",
    "there is only a small number of quarks in the proton that a hard probe can see .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath11 subprocess ( forgetting about the @xmath16 - emission vertex from the scattered electron ) is easy to write down @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the size of the colliding objects , @xmath19 is the probability that @xmath16 scatters if it hits the quark , and @xmath20 is the average number of the hard quarks in the proton .",
    "the parton model interpretation of the variable @xmath1 is the longitudinal momentum of the struck quark , or more precisely the fraction of total proton momentum that the struck quark happens to carry - hence its place of honor as a variable of which @xmath21 depends .",
    "the source of this interpretation is the kinematics of the two body @xmath22 collision .",
    "think of the struck quark to be on shell , massless particle . before the collision it carries momentum @xmath23 since it moves in the same direction as the proton .",
    "after the collision its four momentum is @xmath24 @xmath25 but @xmath26 , so @xmath27 .",
    "thus @xmath28 .",
    "the unknown quantity in the cross section is of course the number of quarks .",
    "we do not know it , since it is a nonperturbative quantity .",
    "it is some property of the proton wave function , which develops over a long period of time and thus crucially depends on the nonperturbative physics .",
    "however one can certainly ask within the perturbation theory how it changes , when we change the `` resolution scale '' @xmath29 , as long as @xmath29 is large . if @xmath29 increases , the change in the quark number is perturbative - it changes simply due to very fast fluctuations . in a way , the old quarks and gluons `` split '' by perturbative radiation processes .",
    "as we increase the resolution of the probe , and also decrease the time duration of the interaction , the probe resolves more and more of these fast fluctuations in the wave function .",
    "this is described by the qcd dglap evolution equation .",
    "= 11.7 cm    in this evolution the picture of the hadron basically does not change .",
    "there are a little bit more partons as we go to higher resolution ( the growth is logarithmic in perturbative qcd ) , since when we look closer sometimes we see that what we thought was one parton , is in fact two sitting close together . but",
    "the density of partons in the transverse space actually decreases , since the size of the resolved partons decreases much faster than their number increases .    but what happens if we increase the energy of the process keeping the resolution fixed ( decrease @xmath1 at fixed @xmath7 ) ?",
    "again there will be a growth of number .",
    "the partons split and multiply by the same process of radiation of gluons .",
    "but the splitting now is predominantly in the longitudinal direction and on the same transverse scale .",
    "the partons split , but keep their transverse size .",
    "when looked `` face on '' the proton becomes denser and denser .",
    "= 11.7 cm    again this is the effect of fluctuations .",
    "this time as it turns out ( and as we will see later ) the dominant contribution comes from gluons .",
    "so think about it as if `` valence ''",
    "partons are surrounded by gluon cloud .",
    "the gluons in this cloud fluctuate very quickly , and are not seen by the probe , since their effect averages to zero during the time of the interaction . but",
    "increasing energy means that we are boosting our proton .",
    "boost leads to lorentz time dilation , so what used to be fast becomes slow .",
    "the gluons `` freeze '' . this cold gluon cloud ( cgc )",
    "is indeed seen by the probe and is the main culprit for the growth of cross sections with energy .",
    "the caveat is of course , that the photon does not see gluons directly , and so for dis this effect comes into being slowly - only due to the fact that the sea quark distributions grow due to the growth of gluon cloud .",
    "but for @xmath30 collisions for example one has direct gluon - gluon subprocesses , and those trigger directly on the gluons in the proton .",
    "evolving far enough in energy will create a system where many gluons overlap in the transverse plane .",
    "the physics of the proton wave function becomes quite different - physics of a dense gluonic system , rather than that of a dilute small number of partons .",
    "one has to be a little careful with the terminology - we are still looking at this system on relatively short time scales , on which the gluon cloud is static .",
    "thus even though the system is dense , the physics is not that of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless the high density certainly has profound effect on all kinds of observables .    what can we expect to see , if we collide two such dense `` black '' objects ?",
    "think of the limit when the whole face of the proton is covered by these overlapping frozen gluons .",
    "it is more or less homogeneous on the low momentum scale , but is still of course grainy if we probe it at short enough distance .",
    "one can define the scale , which is proportional to the transverse density of gluons .",
    "let s call it the saturation momentum - @xmath31 .",
    "this scale separates the `` homogeneous '' regime from the `` grainy '' regime . for spatial resolution",
    "worse than @xmath32 gluons strongly overlap in the transverse plane , while at resolution better than @xmath32 the gluonic system looks dilute .",
    "so @xmath32 is the resolution at which the packing fraction of gluons in the transverse plane is about one half . as this is the characteristic transverse scale in the problem",
    ", we expect that after collision most final state gluons will pick up this momentum @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath31 is large the physics at this scale is perturbative - we produce hard `` minijets '' .",
    "these minijets will dominate the final state and so maybe we will even be able to describe the bulk of the cross section ( total cross section ? ) in terms of these perturbative processes .",
    "they are certainly not trivially calculable , as we have to learn how to deal with dense gluonic medium .",
    "clearly naive perturbation theory in the sense i described above does not work in this dense medium .",
    "but at least in principle we do not require the knowledge of soft physics of confinement and we expect with some effort to be able to figure the problem out .    of course , the @xmath33 is not the only type of physics that exists even in this regime .",
    "there are even more perturbative processes , like real hard jets",
    ". those will stay perturbative in the usual sense , although their multiplicities will be also affected , as presumably gluon distributions will change significantly in this regime .",
    "there will also remain the soft physics .",
    "proton has finite size , and clearly the density will grow in the center faster than on periphery .",
    "there will always be a peripheral region which is `` gray '' and not `` black '' , that is where the analog of @xmath31 is of order @xmath34 .",
    "= 11.7 cm    we can not hope to be able to describe the peripheral gray region in any kind of perturbative approach .",
    "confinement rules there , and confinement therefore will rule eventually for total and elastic cross sections .",
    "however it is conceivable that in some intermediate energy regime , the bulk of the proton is already `` black '' , but the peripheral region is still not too large . in this regime",
    "the total cross section can be dominated by the minijet processes , and might be describable perturbatively",
    "! it would be almost too good to be true if this did happen .",
    "this is a very long shot , and we would be extremely lucky .",
    "but in principle such a possibility exists and is very interesting to explore .    to summarize , some of the questions we may hope to address in the high energy - large density regime are    \\1 .",
    "how does this blackness develop in the first place ( pomeron loops are presumably important ) ?",
    "\\2 . how does the density of the gluon cloud change with energy , and what is the density profile ( transverse momentum dependence ) ?",
    "\\3 . what is the final state structure when colliding these `` black '' objects .    \\4 .",
    "what can we say about the total cross section ?",
    "i will certainly not answer all of these questions in these lectures .",
    "in fact i will not even address most , and for those i will address only tentative answers will be provided .",
    "nevertheless a lot has been done and some has been understood in this area and there is ample room for further progress , which is enough of a motivation in itself .",
    "so let s start climbing into the cold gluon cloud .",
    "we all fly a lot these days and know that going through a cloud could be often bumpy .",
    "so fasten your seatbelts and let s go .",
    "the plan of these lectures is the following .",
    "\\a ) derive the evolution equation ( evolution in energy , x or rapidity ) for the scattering of a dilute perturbative projectile on a dense target .",
    "this is what is variably known as bk , jimwlk , b - jimwlk and b - jimwlk@xmath35 equation .",
    "\\b ) discuss briefly what is known about the qualitative behavior of its solutions .",
    "discuss what kind of corrections have to be taken into account when the projectile itself becomes dense ( pomeron loops ) .",
    "calculate some corrections of this type and discuss a little bit what kind of physics we expect from them .",
    "d ) . prove an interesting duality relation which the complete evolution equation , including the pomeron loops must satisfy .",
    "consider a small perturbative projectile with the wave function @xmath36 impinging from the left on a large dense target with the wave function @xmath37 .",
    "the target is dense , and therefore has large gauge fields .",
    "the projectile on the other hand is just a bunch of partons . in the following",
    "i will disregard quarks , and will only consider gluons as the dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "we assume that both the target and the projectile move with close to velocity of light .",
    "their longitudinal sizes are therefore lorentz contracted in the lab frame into pancakes of almost zero width .",
    "thus all the projectile partons are localized around @xmath38 , while the color fields of the target are at @xmath39 .",
    "the only nontrivial dynamics therefore happens in the transverse plane .",
    "we want first of all to derive an expression for the @xmath40-matrix for the collision of two such objects , and then see how it evolves with energy .",
    "we assume that the initial energy is already quite large .",
    "first consider a single gluon in the projectile wave function .",
    "it has a large energy and therefore while traveling through the target it continues along the straight line .",
    "of course it could happen from time to time that it experiences hard scatterings and changes its direction of motion , but these events are rare and contribute very little to the total cross section .",
    "so the single most important thing that happens to the traveling gluon as a result of the interaction is that its color degree of freedom rotates .",
    "@xmath41 the @xmath40-matrix operator in this approximation is block diagonal . it is diagonal in the space of transverse coordinates , particle number etc , and is nontrivial only in the space of color indices . the matrix @xmath42 must be unitary , since the @xmath40-matrix is a unitary operator .",
    "the forward scattering amplitude is defined as the overlap of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 states , and thus is given by the unitary matrix we have just defined @xmath45    now in fact one can express the matrix @xmath40 in terms of the target fields through which the gluon is propagating .",
    "the target of course is a quantum object , and therefore the fields in it fluctuate .",
    "however the propagation happens very fast , as we assume that the energy of the projectile is large .",
    "therefore during the propagation the projectile really sees a fixed field configuration .",
    "since we are considering the projectile to consist of partons , it is convenient to use the light cone gauge , in which the wave function of the projectile has partonic description , namely @xmath46 . in this gauge naturally",
    "the largest component of the field in the target is @xmath47 .",
    "the target moves with large rapidity in the negative @xmath48 direction . recall that under the lorentz boost in the negative @xmath48 direction the components of vector potential transform as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the boost parameter . thus a large @xmath47 field component is generated in the target when accelerating it",
    "the @xmath40 matrix of a fast particle interacting with the @xmath47 field is given by the eikonal formula @xmath51^{ab } \\label{alpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the strong interaction coupling constant , @xmath53 ( change of notation for historical reasons only ) , @xmath54 is the @xmath55 generator in the adjoint representation and @xmath56 denotes the path ordering along the trajectory of the propagating gluon .. now , the fields @xmath57 are of course operators in the target hilbert space .",
    "so to calculate the @xmath40-matrix for the process , we have to average over the target wave function .",
    "@xmath58w_t[\\alpha ] \\label{walpha}\\ ] ] we have introduced here the weight function @xmath59 $ ] which should be thought of as the square of the target wave function and thus gives the probability density to find a particular configuration of @xmath60 in the wave function of the target .",
    "there is a subtlety involved here , and the identification of @xmath61 with the square of the wave function is not entirely correct@xcite .",
    "but it is good enough for all we are going to do it these lectures .",
    "we can also redefine @xmath61 in such a way that the basic variable becomes @xmath40 .",
    "so @xmath62 \\label{ws}\\ ] ] with the understanding that @xmath61 is normalized as the probability density @xmath63=1\\ ] ] the functionals @xmath64 in equations ( [ walpha ] ) and ( [ ws ] ) strictly speaking differ by the jacobean of the transformation ( [ alpha ] ) , but for the simplicity of notation i will not indicate this explicitly .",
    "consider now an arbitrary projectile whose wave function in the gluon fock space can be written as @xmath65|0\\rangle \\label{wf}\\ ] ] the gluon creation operator @xmath66 depends on the transverse coordinate , and also on the longitudinal momentum @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that all the gluons are energetic , and therefore all gluon operators which enter eq.([wf ] ) have longitudinal momenta above some cutoff @xmath68",
    ". we will refer to these degrees of freedom as `` valence '' .",
    "the longitudinal momenta of the gluons are not explicitly written down in eq.([wf ] ) because we assume that as long as those gluons are energetic enough they all scatter eikonally , and thus their amplitude does not depend on the exact value of the momentum .    now , since the interaction with the target takes a very short time , all gluons scatter independently of each other .",
    "thus the outgoing state simply has every gluon creation operator multiplied by the single gluons scattering matrix at the corresponding transverse position .",
    "@xmath69|0\\rangle\\ ] ]    given this , the formal expression for the @xmath40 - matrix of the projectile can be written as @xmath70\\equiv \\langle p|\\hat s|p\\rangle=\\langle 0|\\psi^*[a^ { a}_i(x ) ] \\psi[s_{ab}(x)a^{\\dagger b}_i(x)]|0\\rangle\\ ] ]    the forward scattering amplitude for the process is thus given by @xmath71\\,\\,w_t[s ] \\label{average}\\ ] ]    now given these engredients , we ask how does the forward amplitude change as we make more energy available for the collision .",
    "we can increase the center of mass energy of the colliding system by either boosting the target or the projectile .",
    "of course it does not matter , since the s - matrix is lorentz scalar .",
    "the jimwlk equation , which is what we set out to derive , is the equation for the evolution of the target probability density function @xmath64 .",
    "however it is more convenient to derive it by considering boosting the projectile , and then imposing the requirement of lorentz invariance of the amplitude .",
    "so let s think what happens if we boost the projectile . in what we did so far , we assumed that we know the projectile wave function at longitudinal momenta greater than some cutoff @xmath68 .",
    "we also tacitly assumed that the number of particles below this cutoff is small .",
    "otherwise they would also contribute to the s - matrix .",
    "so even though we do not know exactly how the wave function looks for @xmath72 , we are not particularly worried .",
    "however once we start to be interested in boosting , this becomes a very important question .",
    "the point is that in qcd boosting a state changes the number of gluons in it .",
    "let s pause and ask ourselves how does this happen ?",
    "let s say we boost the state with some rapidity @xmath73 .",
    "we know that one effect of this is to scale the longitudinal momenta of all the particles present in the wave function by @xmath74 so if we had particles sitting above some cutoff @xmath68 and the phase space below the cutoff was small , then the cutoff moves and the phase space increases .",
    "= 11.7 cm    the boost drags particles from under the cutoff into the `` observable '' range of momenta .",
    "the `` unknown '' phase space is stretched : @xmath75    by itself this is not a big problem . if the number of particles does not change , then it does not matter much if their longitudinal momenta have increased - in our calculation the scattering amplitude does not depend on the value of the longitudinal momentum .",
    "the trouble is that in qcd things are more complicated .",
    "remember : gluons ( or photons ) are transverse modes of the color field ( electromagnetic field ) . in principle",
    "the color field also has a longitudinal component - coulomb field , which is non dynamical",
    ". however boost does not preserve the longitudinal nature of the field , and thus transforms the coulomb field into live gluons .",
    "think as an example of a static charge .",
    "it is accompanied by the coulomb electric field @xmath76 this is purely longitudinal .",
    "now boost it with a very large rapidity .",
    "it s a little bit too cumbersome to write down explicit expressions for finite boost , so let us formally write it for infinite boost .",
    "we know that what you get is the electric field which is shrunk to a @xmath77-function in the longitudinal direction , while since the total flux is not changed the transverse components decrease much slower at large transverse distances .",
    "@xmath78 this is the so called weizsaker - williams ( ww ) field .",
    "it obviously has transverse components since @xmath79 .",
    "so by boosting a benign coulomb field we have created live gluons / photons .",
    "we can actually calculate how many we have created .",
    "we will do it more formally in the next lecture , but for now we only have to remember how the gluon creation and annihilation operators are related to the electric field @xmath80=i\\sqrt { k^+}[a_i(k)-a_i^\\dagger(k)]\\ ] ] where the last line assumes large longitudinal momentum . for the weizsaker - williams field",
    "@xmath81 so we find @xmath82 and the total number of gluons at a given transverse momentum @xmath83 that s quite impressive : we have created the number of particles proportional to the total longitudinal phase space opened up by the boost .",
    "if we boost by a large @xmath73 , we create lots of gluons out of the coulomb field .",
    "and we do have coulomb field : we have valence gluons in our wave function .",
    "they have color charges , and therefore by fiat create coulomb field , and this will turn into new gluons after boost ; the new gluons also have color charge , and so they carry their own coulomb field and so it goes on .",
    "now , the coulomb field ( or the zero mode , or whatever you want to call it ) is really everything there is below our cutoff @xmath68 . to know how many gluons will be created by the boost",
    ", we therefore need to peak under the cutoff .",
    "the lesson is that in order to find the evolution of @xmath40 we need to know the wave function below @xmath68 to greater accuracy than simply saying there are almost no gluons there .",
    "this is our next task .",
    "w are now going to address the question : given that we know the wave function above @xmath68 , how do we find it below @xmath68 ?",
    "our aim now is to find the projectile wave function at low longitudinal momenta .",
    "first of all we have to set up the hamiltonian calculation .",
    "since our projectile moves very fast , the formalism that is most suited for it is the light cone quantization . this has been used for many years now in the context of the parton model , but also more recently to study the spectrum of qcd .",
    "a comprehensive review of the formalism is given in @xcite .",
    "the essence of this setup is that one quantizes not on the equal time surface @xmath84 and dynamically evolves states in time , but rather on the surface @xmath39 .",
    "the evolution in @xmath85 ( which is the analog of the time variable ) is generated by the operator @xmath86 .",
    "this is done in the light cone gauge @xmath46 .",
    "yet another component of the vector potential is eliminated , since one of the maxwell s equations becomes a constraint on the light cone : @xmath87 which is solved by @xmath88 this is very convenient , since only the transverse field components are left as dynamical degrees of freedom and all non dynamical fields are already eliminated .",
    "the curios feature of the light cone quantization ( lcq ) is that it has only half of the number of degrees of freedom compared to the equal time quantization",
    ". only positive longitudinal momentum components of the field create particles , while negative longitudinal components annihilate them .",
    "this is understandable , since we want to describe the situation where all the particles move right with large energy .",
    "a state like this can not by definition contain particles with negative momentum , and thus negative momentum can not correspond to particle creation , but only to annihilation .",
    "the mathematical manifestation of this is that the fields @xmath89 contain both , canonical coordinates and canonical momenta and thus do not commute at different values of the longitudinal coordinate @xmath90 .",
    "when all is said and done , and when the quantization is performed properly , the lcq formalism amounts to the following .",
    "the `` time '' coordinate is @xmath85 , the `` space '' coordinates are @xmath91 .",
    "the basic degrees of freedom are the transverse components of vector potential with the commutation relation    @xmath92    = { i\\over 2}\\epsilon(x^--y^-)\\ , \\delta_{ab}\\ , \\delta^{ij}\\ ,               \\delta^{(2)}({\\bf x } - { \\bf y})\\ , , \\ ] ]    where @xmath93 is the antisymmetric step function @xmath94 . in momentum space",
    "the commutator reads @xmath95",

    "hence the integral over @xmath90 in the constraint eq.([constr ] ) .",
    "the standard perturbation theory can be formulated straightforwardly in this framework .",
    "first of all , one notices that even though the theory is interacting , the exact ground state of this hamiltonian is the fock space vacuum of the operators @xmath103 .",
    "this is easy to understand . since the hamiltonian commutes with the total momentum operator in the longitudinal direction , @xmath104 , when written in momentum space each and every term in this hamiltonian has to have vanishing total longitudinal momentum . but",
    "this immediately means that there can be no terms which contain only creation operators of the type @xmath105 , since all creation operators have positive longitudinal momentum !",
    "thus each term must contain at least one annihilation operator , and therefore the fock space vacuum of @xmath106 is also the vacuum of @xmath99 .    at any rate the free hamiltonian is @xmath107 and this defines the standard free dispersion relation @xmath108    we are however not interested in the vacuum state .",
    "we want to examine the state which contains some particles at valence momenta @xmath109 , and in particular to find how this state looks like at momenta below @xmath68 .",
    "there is a very natural framework in which to approach this problem , namely the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "the free dispersion relation @xmath110 tells us that the frequencies of the high momentum modes are small while those of small momentum modes are large .",
    "thus in the framework of the light cone evolution , the high longitudinal momentum modes are slow degrees of freedom , and we can study the low momentum mode wave function by momentarily freezing the high @xmath67 part .",
    "this of course is very much in line with the picture of the gluon cloud which cools and freezes under the boost transformation .",
    "the most important characteristic of the high momentum component of the state is its colour charge density @xmath111 since the eikonal @xmath40-matrix depends only on the colour charge density at every point in the transverse plane .",
    "so the strategy is the following .",
    "we will forget about the self interaction of the high @xmath67 modes in the hamiltonian .",
    "we will keep the self interaction of low @xmath67 modes as is . and additionally we will keep the eikonal interaction between the fast and slow modes , namely the interaction between the low @xmath67 modes and the color charge density generated by the valence modes .",
    "one can question the applicability of the born - oppenheimer approximation , since the spectrum of frequencies in the problem is actually continuous , so there is no big frequency gap between what we call `` fast '' and what we call `` slow '' .",
    "fortunately however the @xmath72 bin is dominated by modes with momentum much smaller than @xmath68 .",
    "the relevant corrections are proportional to the total phase space available in the low @xmath67 bin , and that goes as @xmath112 .",
    "this means that the momenta that dominate the integrals are of order @xmath113 .",
    "i will not further justify this approximation here , but it turns out to be precisely the same eikonal approximation which we used to define the scattering matrix .",
    "all said and done the coupling between the valence and the soft modes appears in the hamiltonian through the modified electric contribution @xmath114 now , although @xmath115 is an operator on the valence hilbert space , as far as the soft fields are concerned , it is a @xmath116-number function . also we will assume , consistently with our discussion so far that the number of valence gluons is parametrically of order one , and thus also @xmath117 this makes life much easier , as the interaction term is multiplied by the qcd coupling constant .",
    "so we can apply perturbation theory .",
    "let us therefore calculate the lowest order perturbative correction to the vacuum wave function of the soft gluons in the presence of valence charge density .",
    "as already explained , to zeroth order the vacuum of the lch is simply the fock space vacuum of @xmath106 . to first order",
    "the correction to the vacuum is given by @xmath118 where the summation is over the eigenstates of the zeroth order hamiltonian , and @xmath119 denotes the zeroth order energy of the respective eigenstate .",
    "what makes the calculation simple , is that to first order only the interaction term that involves the valence charge gives a contribution .",
    "the reason is that , as we have noted before the fock space vacuum is actually annihilated by all terms of the lch , as they contain at least one annihilation operator .",
    "this is not the case however for the soft - valence coupling @xmath120\\rho^a(-k_\\perp)\\ ] ] this hamiltonian creates only one particle state from the vacuum : @xmath121 with @xmath119 determined by the free dispersion relation we can write the soft gluon vacuum state to first order in the coupling as @xmath122 where the `` classical '' field @xmath123 is precisely the weizsaker - williams field of the colour charge density @xmath124 @xmath125 actually one has to be a little bit more careful .",
    "we have found the correct wave function , but it is not properly normalized .",
    "the normalization strictly speaking is the second order correction in @xmath52 , but it has to be restored if we want to have unitary evolution .",
    "this is easily done , by simply subtracting from the coefficient of the fock vacuum term the total probability to have a one gluon state in the wave function .",
    "@xmath126\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & i\\int d^2xb_i^a(x)\\int_{k<\\lambda}\\left . { dk^+\\over \\pi^{1/2 } | k^+|^{1/2 } } a^{\\dagger a}_i(k^+ , x)\\right\\}|0\\rangle   \\label{wfun}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fact , as will become obvious later , this is the only @xmath127 correction to the wave function which gives contribution of @xmath127 to the evolution equation .",
    "so we found what we were looking for - the weizsacker - williams field hiding behind the cutoff . boosting the state",
    "we will pull out this field from underneath the cutoff and into the wide open world .",

    "this is easy to do using lorentz invariance of the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "recall that the forward scattering amplitude is given by the equation ( [ reminder ] ) .",
    "let us restore the rapidity labels on various quantities .",
    "the @xmath40 matrix is defined at rapidity of interest @xmath50 .",
    "but we can think of this rapidity as distributed between the target and the projectile .",

    "first , as is clear from the above derivation , the introduction of the additional coordinate @xmath90 and the path ordering in eq.([alpha ] ) is not really necessary .",
    "it merely serves to mimic the action of @xmath157 on a function of @xmath40 as in eq.([equiv ] ) . in the framework of jimwlk equation",
    "it has no independent meaning , since none of the physical observables depend on @xmath90 .",
    "jimwlk lives happily without the additional coordinate and is defined exclusively in terms of the unitary matrix @xmath40 and its functional derivative @xmath158 .",
    "i have only written it here in this form for those who have seen it before and are used to this particular notation .",
    "my personal preference is clearly not to introduce unnecessary variables , so i prefer the much simpler form eq.([smallevolution ] ) .",
    "the second remark is about the applicability of this equation .",
    "we have derived it here assuming the projectile is small and deriving the evolution of the projectile wave function . on the other hand",
    "the original derivation was given directly for the target wave function , assuming explicitly that the target is dense , that is that the average of the single gluon @xmath40 matrix is close to zero @xcite .",
    "how come we get the same equations under seemingly unrelated conditions ?",
    "the answer is that these two conditions - diluteness of the projectile and dense nature of the target are actually inextricably related by the form of the @xmath40-matrix eq.([reminder ] ) .",
    "mathematically diluteness of the projectile is simply the statement that the projectile averaged @xmath40-matrix @xmath137 has only low order terms in the taylor expansion in powers of @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the target is dense it means that the probability density functional @xmath64 is strongly peaked around @xmath159 . if that is the case , clearly eq.([reminder ] ) will again be dominated by the first few terms in the taylor expansion of @xmath137 .",
    "thus the diluteness of projectile , and the dense nature of the target in eq.([reminder ] ) go hand in hand .",
    "finally the last remark is related to the operatorial nature of @xmath40 . as i have mentioned before",
    ", the single gluon scattering matrix is in fact an operator in the hilbert space of the target .",
    "nevertheless we have allowed ourselves to treat it as a @xmath116-number field neglecting possible commutators .",
    "the reason we can do this is because the target is dense .",
    "what this means , is that the charge density of the target is large .",
    "parametrically jimwlk equation corresponds to the target charge densities @xmath160 . in this regime",
    "the commutator @xmath161=it_{ab}^c\\rho^c$ ] is suppressed by @xmath162 relative to the product of @xmath115 s and can therefore be neglected .",
    "this makes @xmath60 s also classical and together with them the matrices @xmath40 themselves .",
    "let me now discuss some conspicuous limits of the jimwlk equation and some properties of its solutions .      since its introduction by al mueller @xcite ,",
    "the dipole degrees of freedom have become very popular in the discussion of high energy scattering .",
    "the formal justification for this model is the large @xmath163 limit . in this limit , in any diagram",
    "a gluon line can be represented as a double line of a fictitious quark and antiquark .",
    "it turns out that the diagrams in which these fictitious quarks and antiquarks form singlet states - dipoles , are leading in the large @xmath163 limit .",
    "the vertex of emission of the ww gluon then is simply represented as the splitting of one dipole into two .",
    "= 11.7 cm    the simplicity of the dipole picture , is that there is no color degree of freedom anymore , so that the @xmath40-matrix of a dipole is a single number rather than an @xmath55 matrix . since the color was the only degree of freedom in which the eikonal @xmath40-matrix was not diagonal , the @xmath40 matrix in the dipole model is in fact diagonal .",
    "we can derive the dipole model limit of the jimwlk equation in a very simple way .",
    "the @xmath40 matrix for a dipole is related to the single gluon @xmath40-matrix as : @xmath164 where now @xmath165 is the fundamental representation of the single gluon scattering matrix ( which is the scattering matrix of the fictitious quark which constitutes the dipole ) .",
    "we now assume that the projectile and the target consist entirely of dipoles , that is that the probability density functional @xmath61 and the projectile scattering matrix @xmath137 depends only on this particular combination @xmath166 , @xmath167 .",

    "this is best valid when the target is dense and when the correlation length of the target fields is small , smaller than the distance between the two dipoles . strictly speaking the factorization of the nonlinear term",
    "is not valid when the target is far from saturation , that is @xmath183 .",
    "however in this regime the nonlinear term is not important anyway , and so it came to be that the numerical results obtained studying the kovchegov equation @xcite so far are very close to the results obtained from the whole jimwlk hierarchy @xcite .      omitting the nonlinear term @xmath184 in ( [ s04])we recover the bfkl equation .",
    "it is of course always nice to see a familiar face , however on the negative side , the bfkl equation is known to be problematic .",
    "it violates unitary in more than one way .",
    "that is to say it violates both the unitarity of the scattering probability ( the probability can not exceed one ) and the unitarity of the total cross section ( the cross section can not grow faster than the froissart bound @xmath185 in any massive theory ) .    the first violation is due to the fact that the solution of the bfkl equation for @xmath21 grows without bound .",
    "bfkl is a linear equation and thus if the kernel has a positive eigenvalue clearly the probability grows .",
    "indeed the bfkl solution at asymptotically large rapidities is@xcite @xmath186 here @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 being the riemann zeta function , with @xmath1 -the size of the dipole , and @xmath190 -the impact parameter .",
    "this unitarity problem is cured by jimwlk .",
    "this is easiest to see on the level of kovchegov equation .",
    "clearly in the presence of the nonlinear term the point @xmath191 is the fixed point of the equation .",
    "if one starts with small @xmath21 , it can not grow beyond unity .",
    "in fact , the evolution works in the way quite consistent with our initial expectations about the generation of a typical intrinsic momentum scale .",
    "in particular , at every rapidity @xmath50 , there is a dipole size @xmath192 such that for the dipoles of larger sizes the target is black ( the scattering probability is close to unity ) , while for smaller size dipoles it is basically transparent .",
    "the inverse of this scale is the saturation momentum @xmath193 .",
    "from the point of view of the target evolution , this is the scale on which the target is grainy - you probe it at smaller distances , you are liable to see very little since the fields are correlated and the phase rotation of @xmath194 and @xmath195 are the same , while at larger separation the phases rotate randomly and the scattering is almost unavoidable .",
    "i will discuss properties of @xmath31 some more in a short while .",
    "however there is also another problem , and that is that the bfkl probability amplitude grows large at large impact parameters . in particular in the bfkl solution",
    "the probability is of order one at impact parameters all the way to @xmath196 with @xmath197 somewhat smaller than one , but not significantly so .",
    "as long as @xmath21 is smaller than one , the nonlinear term in the kovchegov equation is not effective , thus it is clear that in this peripheral region the solution of the nonlinear equation is similar to that of bfkl .",
    "the total cross section is given by @xmath198 this blatantly violates the froissart bound .",
    "the qualitative picture is that of the growth of the dipole due to the long range nature of the ww fields @xcite .",
    "since perturbative gluon is massless , this growth in the transverse space is very fast , which leads to the violation of the froissart bound .",
    "= 11.7 cm    to solve this problem one has to understand the real infrared scale of qcd - how is it that gluons do not travel farther than @xmath34 from their parents .",
    "this problem is outside the scope of b - jimwlk@xmath35 , and so there is no real wonder that it stays unresolved .",
    "not all is doom and gloom though . even though the total cross section at very high energies is nonpertubative , it does not mean one can not extract useful physics from jimwlk .",
    "recall , the main motivation to consider the physics of saturation is to study the `` minijet physics '' around and about the saturation scale . this can be done , since the main mechanism of the generation of @xmath31 is local and is unaffected by the nonperturbative coulomb tails .",
    "the properties of the solutions of the kovchegov equation have been studied very extensively @xcite , but the main properties can be understood in a very simple way @xcite . basically the solutions to kovchegov equation is the same as that of bfkl for transverse sizes for which @xmath183 , while for sizes where the bfkl solution violates unitarity , the bk solution is simply unity . a good approximation to the bfkl solution at large energy is ( one have to integrate the @xmath190 dependence in the formula above ) @xmath199 where @xmath68 is the scale that characterizes the target at initial rapidity ( not the longitudinal cutoff of the previous lecture ! ) , and @xmath200 is a pure number .",
    "the crossover scale @xmath31 is determined by equating this expression to a number of order unity .",
    "one finds @xmath201 which determines the saturation momentum @xmath202 the interesting feature of this solution is that if now we rewrite the amplitude in terms of @xmath193 ( still in the regime where it is small ) we obtain @xmath203 thus there is no separate dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath50 , but only on one particular combination of the two quantities .",
    "this phenomenon came to be known as geometric scaling .",
    "of course , generally one expects such a behavior for any saturated system at transverse momenta around @xmath31 .",
    "here however the surprising thing is , that due to the fact that the amplitude is a simple power , the scaling persists to values of momentum much larger than @xmath31 .",
    "a simple estimate of the values of @xmath1 where the scaling breaks down goes as follows .",
    "there are corrections to the bfkl solutions at small values of @xmath1 .",
    "the leading correction is the appearance in the exponent of the same factor @xmath204 this factor becomes comparable with the terms that we kept in eq.([nas ] ) when @xmath205 .",
    "reexpressing this in terms of the saturation momentum , we find that the corrections are small all the way to @xmath206 so it turns out that in the bfkl solution geometric scaling persists to dipole sizes very much smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "although this is a very interesting property , one has to be careful when trying to assess its phenomenological relevance .",
    "it does not appear to be a universal prediction of saturation but a specific property of the solution of the bfkl equation .",
    "therefore , even though the dis data clearly exhibits such scaling @xcite for small values of @xmath1 , its description in terms of the solution of jimwlk equation is only as good as the bfkl fit to dis data @xcite .",
    "what we have accomplished so far is the derivation of the evolution equation in the leading order in qcd coupling constant , in the eikonal approximation and assuming dilute projectile and dense target .",
    "so quite a number of restrictions and any one of them when lifted may change results dramatically .",
    "in particular , we know that higher order corrections to bfkl equation are very large . and this remains the main threat even if the nonlinearities are accounted for .",
    "will the infrared part of emission kill the whole idea of perturbatively probing saturation ?",
    "we do nt know , but we also can do nothing about it at this point , except try and analyze these corrections @xcite .",
    "what about the eikonal approximation ?",
    "how long can we rely on it ? here",
    "we pretty much know that it will break down eventually , but we can estimate when it will happen .",
    "assume that we start with a dipole with initially large energy @xmath207 .",
    "the saturation momentum of the target is what governs the recoil effects which are neglected in the eikonal approximation . as the saturation momentum becomes of the order of the initial energy , @xmath208",
    "the eikonal approximation should be abandoned . even assuming that the saturation momentum does grow exponentially ( which is certainly not the case when next to leading corrections",
    "are taken into account @xcite ) this condition gives @xmath209 this is pretty far away , so the question is really academic .",
    "there is plenty of rapidity to go before we reach this limit , and so we can safely use eikonal approximation for years to come .",
    "now what about the nature of the projectile - target system ?",
    "this question is the focus of very intense investigation in the last year .",
    "it goes under various names , like pomeron loops , fluctuations or wave function saturation effects . and",
    "this is what i want to talk about in the rest of these lectures .",
    "so why should we bother ?",
    "well , jimwlk is strictly applicable only when the target is dense .",
    "amazingly and surprisingly , its formal low density limit reduces to the bfkl equation , which is the correct equation at low densities .",
    "but what we really want to understand is the transition between the dilute and the dense regime . and",
    "in this region , for sure things are missing from jimwlk .",
    "let us be faithful to the projectile wave function picture , and look at the question from this point of view .",
    "here we have made the approximation that the density is small .",
    "for example our expression for the ww field was first order in the color charge density @xmath210 this approximation is responsible for the very fast exponential growth of the projectile density ( and so the saturation momentum ) .",
    "remember , we have found that the number of gluons is proportional to @xmath211 ?",
    "we can also easily calculate the change in the color charge density itself @xmath212 in our wave function @xmath213 roughly speaking we have a linear homogeneous equation for the evolution of the projectile density ( we can be more precise and see that the charge density correlator actually satisfies the bfkl equation ) @xmath214 the solution to which is clearly an exponential in y @xmath215 the exponential growth of the projectile density is the origin of the exponential growth of the saturation momentum @xmath31 .",
    "the physics of this is very simple - the number of gluons created by evolution is proportional to the number of gluons ( color charges ) already existing in the state . that s because every gluon in the wave function emits independently of the presence of other gluons .",
    "but of course as a result of such evolution the projectile wave function itself becomes dense , at which point independent emission approximation is not valid anymore .",
    "in fact two things will happen when @xmath115 becomes large , and they combine to give an interesting picture .",
    "first , there will be nonlinear effects in the emission .",
    "simplistically , we can think of this by just assuming that the emissions are happening not in the empty space , but in the presence of a non vanishing background field ( the ww field itself ) .",
    "the emission vertex then should be modified to something like @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the covariant derivative in the @xmath190-background , @xmath218 .",
    "this has the effect that when the field @xmath190 is large ( or better to say for momenta smaller than the scale determined by @xmath190 ) the emitted field is not proportional to @xmath115 anymore , but is simply of order unity @xmath219 there is also another effect , that i will call `` bleaching of color '' .",
    "when the projectile is dilute , all gluons are emitted into points in space where there were no other gluons previously .",
    "this means that the charge density at these points monotonically grows . but",
    "suppose we are now in the dense regime , so that a gluon is emitted with large probability into a point where there already exists a large color charge .",
    "= 11.7 cm    what happens to the color at this point ?",
    "well , the color casimir there is as likely to decrease as it is likely to increase . the color charge density will random walk ! in fact , coupled with our expectation that the emission probability of the gluon is constant and independent of density , we expect genuine random walk process .",
    "@xmath220 much , much slower than exponential !",
    "this clearly must have a large effect on physics .",
    "we do not understand yet very well what quantities will change significantly and which will not .",
    "for example @xmath31 may not change too much , since it is mainly sensitive to the range of momenta where @xmath115 is borderline small .",
    "but it certainly will effect the structure of final states at momenta smaller than @xmath31 and may well also affect the properties of the gluon distribution above @xmath31 .    at any rate looks like fun physics to investigate and understand .    incidentally ,",
    "the bleaching of color , i believe is the same as pomeron loops .",
    "the gluon is emitted , but is not actually seen , as its color is bleached by the gluon emitted in the next rapidity step .",
    "so effectively this is a loop .",
    "to include the saturation effects in the projectile wave function is therefore the same as including pomeron loops in the high energy evolution .",
    "do we know how to do that ?",
    "not so far , although there have been a lot of progress in this direction recently .",
    "i will tell you a little about the results obtained so far , and you will hear more about it from dionysis talk later on@xcite .",
    "let s go back to our lch and see if we can do something when the color charge is not too small .",

    "it would be nice of course , if this was the whole story , but unfortunately it is not .",
    "if one does things more carefully it turns out that the shift by the classical field mixes positive and negative longitudinal momenta .",
    "this means that the vacuum of the transformed hamiltonian is not the fock space vacuum any more , but rather there is a bogoliubov transformation which transforms one into the other .",
    "thus the soft vacuum is not simply @xmath237 and more work has to be done to find it .",
    "these corrections , at least on the face of it are not parametrically suppressed relative to the coherent transformation .",
    "so we do not quite know the evolution kernel yet .",
    "there are however some interesting hints that we can get from these expressions .",
    "the propagation of the gluon carries an eikonal factor @xmath40 . on the other hand the classical field of the projectile",
    "can be expressed in terms of matrices @xmath238 , which also can be written as eikonal - like factors , but this time in terms of the projectile charge density , which as we have seen becomes a derivative with respect to the phase of the eikonal factor .",
    "this is suggestive of some kind of duality , just like duality between @xmath1 and @xmath239 for a simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "indeed , as it turns out , it is possible to prove that lorentz invariance plus the condition that the projectile and target wave functions evolve in the same way ( projectile - target democracy ) requires that the evolution be self dual @xcite . in the last lecture",
    "i discuss in more detail the derivation of this self duality property .",
