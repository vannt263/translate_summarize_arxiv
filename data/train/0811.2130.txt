    "the way in which a galaxy has assembled its stars is reflected in the distribution of stellar orbits .",
    "for example , collisionless @xmath0-body collapse simulations predict a predominance of radial orbits in the final remnant @xcite .",
    "in contrast , collisionless galaxy merger simulations predict a variety of orbital compositions , depending on progenitor properties @xcite , the merging geometry @xcite , the progenitor mass ratios @xcite and the presence of dissipational components @xcite .",
    "stars in galaxies are approximately collisionless and the orbital structure  once a galaxy has approached a quasi - steady - state  is conserved for a long time . to a certain extent",
    "then , the assembly mechanism of early - type galaxies can be constrained from their present - day orbital structure .",
    "a global characteristic of the distribution of stellar orbits is its anisotropy .",
    "traditionally , anisotropies of elliptical galaxies have been inferred from the ( @xmath1 ) diagram .",
    "in particular , the rotation of bright ellipticals has been shown to be insufficient to account for their flattening @xcite . however , whether fainter , fast - rotating ellipticals are flattened by rotation is less easy to determine from the ( @xmath1 ) diagram , because isotropic as well as anisotropic systems can rotate .",
    "in fact , fully general axisymmetric dynamical models recently have revealed an anisotropic orbital structure in even the flattest , fast rotating objects @xcite .",
    "one goal of this paper is to investigate numerically the connection between anisotropy , rotation and flattening in spheroidal stellar systems .",
    "in addition , we present global anisotropies for a sample of coma early - type galaxies . these anisotropies are derived by analysing long - slit stellar absorption line kinematics with axisymmetric orbit models .",
    "our dynamical models include dark matter halos .",
    "previous anisotropy determinations for larger samples of ellipticals ( including dark matter ) were restricted to round and non - rotating systems , assuming spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "spherical models do not account for galaxy flattening . in the simplest case , a flattened system is axially symmetric .",
    "early axisymmetric models , however , did not cover all possible anisotropies ( and orbital structures , respectively ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "fully general , orbit - based axisymmetric dynamical models have so far only been applied to the inner regions of ellipticals and the orbital analysis was made under the assumption that mass follows light ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . by the mass - anisotropy degeneracy , the neglect of dark matter could translate to a systematic bias in the corresponding orbital structure ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "comparison of anisotropies derived with and without dark matter will allow one to quantify such a possible bias .",
    "we also discuss anisotropies derived from modelling mock observations of synthetic @xmath0-body merger remnants .",
    "one motivation to do so is that dynamical models of axisymmetric systems may not be unique .",
    "for example , the deprojection of an axisymmetric galaxy is intrinsically degenerate @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the intrinsic shape thereby propagate into uncertainties on the derived masses and anisotropies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the reconstruction of an axisymmetric orbital system is suspected to be further degenerate with the recovered mass ( e.g. the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the case for a generic degeneracy , beyond the effects of noise and incompleteness of the data , is still uncertain ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "numerical studies of a few idealised axisymmetric toy models indicate degeneracies to be moderate when modelling realistically noisy data sets ( @xcite , @xcite ) . since we know the true structure of our @xmath0-body modelling targets , we can extend on these studies and further investigate potential systematics in the models over a broader sample of test cases .",
    "another motivation to model @xmath0-body merger remnants is to probe whether ellipticals have formed by merging .",
    "this requires a comparison of the orbital structure in real ellipticals with predictions of @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , because of the symmetry assumptions in models of real galaxies , it is not straight forward to compare _ intrinsic _ properties of @xmath0-body simulations with _ models _ of real galaxies .",
    "to avoid the related systematics , we here compare models of real galaxies with _ similar models _ of synthetic @xmath0-body merger simulations and both are indicative for true differences between real galaxies and merger predictions .",

    "it has already been discussed in @xcite that the assumption of axial symmetry enforces an inclination mismatch in the z - models : while the triaxial remnants appear flattened in the @xmath144 projection ( face - on ) , axisymmetric systems are necessarily round when seen face - on .",
    "then , because the models are forced towards a wrong viewing - angle , ( 1 ) the intrinsic flattening is underestimated and ( 2 ) x , y and z - axes of models and remnants do no longer correspond to each other .",

    "we have verified this for two out of the six merger remnants ( elong and oblate ) by modelling additional 11 projections ( at intermediate viewing - angles ) . assuming that this result can be generalised to other remnants as well , then figs .",
    "[ aniso_eps ] and [ aniso_recon ] suggest the following : if real galaxies would resemble the modelled merger remnants , then one would see approximately the same relationships @xmath80 and @xmath146 as in the coma and sauron galaxies . however , it is clear from fig .",

    "[ aniso_aniso ] shows that the distribution of anisotropies in the merger remnants is tighter than in real galaxies .",

    "already the averaged anisotropy parameters reveal significant differences to the models of real galaxies . which physical processes are responsible for this discrepancy ?",
    "the orbital structure of the models of merger remnants is largely driven by a population of central box orbits in the @xmath0-body systems @xcite .",
    "they cause the centres of the merger remnants to become triaxial / prolate and are , for example , largely responsible for the wrong viewing angle of the z - models .",
    "dissipation during a merger can have a significant effect on the shape and the projected properties of the final remnant @xcite .",
    "already 10 percent of gas are sufficient to suppress central box orbits and to produce an approximately axisymmetric remnant in binary mergers @xcite ( but this result is based on simulations without star formation ) .",
    "multiple , simultaneous minor mergers likewise produce remnants less triaxial than collisionless binary merger remnants @xcite , but the corresponding kinematics have not yet been studied in detail .",

    "@xcite pointed out that @xmath0-body systems , which have assembled hierarchically in their cosmological simulations @xcite , or by binary mergers with star - formation and black - hole feedback are consistent with the trend between @xmath3 and @xmath2 in observed galaxies .",

    "observed galaxies appear close to these maximum - entropy relations , but exhibit a large degree of individuality .",
    "rotation appears in anisotropic ( @xmath158 ) as well as isotropic systems ( @xmath73 ) , suggesting that the flattening of the galaxies largely arises from a suppression of stars with large energies perpendicular to the equatorial plane .",
    "this is similar to the classical notion of flattening by anisotropy and rules out dfs @xmath72 for most early - type galaxies .",
    "the global similarity between models of observed galaxies and our maximum - entropy toy models suggests that early - type galaxies are largely relaxed stellar systems .",
    "however , there are differences in the details that probably contain valuable information about the assembly mechanism of the galaxies and will be addressed in a future paper .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that both strongly radially anisotropic ( @xmath159 ) and strongly tangentially anisotropic systems ( @xmath160 ) can become unstable ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "maximum entropy models have intermediate anisotropies and are likely stable .",
    "thus , the anisotropies of observed galaxies may not only be understood as being the most likely ones ( in the sense of yielding the maximum entropy at a given flattening ) but could also reflect stability constraints .",
    "so far we lack detailed studies exploring the stability of axisymmetric systems with dark matter halos and various intrinsic anisotropies . since our ( three integral ) toy models can be easily transformed to @xmath0-body systems ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) they provide a suitable tool to setup both artificially anisotropic as well as realistic and observationally motivated initial conditions .    in models of real galaxies the unordered kinetic energy in the azimuthal direction , @xmath161 , can exceed the radial energy @xmath162 by up to 40 percent .",
    "this separates real galaxy models from similar models of collisionless @xmath0-body binary disk mergers , which are instead characterised by radial anisotropy ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "because we have applied the same modelling machinery to both , the real galaxies as well as the synthetic @xmath0-body merger remnants , our findings indicate a true difference between their intrinsic properties .",
    "especially , we have shown that if real galaxies would resemble our merger remnants , then corresponding dynamical models of real data would be radially anisotropic , irrespective of the systematics introduced by the assumption of axial symmetry .",
    "the radial anisotropy of the merger remnants is related to a population of central box orbits . because dissipation during a merger can efficiently suppress box orbits",
