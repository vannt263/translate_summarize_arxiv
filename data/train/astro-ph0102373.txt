    "over the last few years new observations and missions , energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) @xcite , _ chandra _ @xcite , tev- astronomy @xcite , revolutionized the measurement of radiation from a variety of objects in the universe . in most cases",
    "the _ primary _ source of the radiation is believed to be accelerated charged particles , often of remarkably high energies , such as @xmath0 or even higher @xcite , usually referred to as the ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) .",
    "the accelerated particles themselves ( we will also use the term cosmic rays , crs ) are in many cases generated by shock waves ( shocks ) . note , that the latter are the major events where the huge energy of stars , supernovae s ( sn ) or black holes is released in bulk gas motions and ultimately dissipated .",
    "the most successful particle acceleration mechanism is , perhaps the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) @xcite , which is a variant of the original fermi idea ( 1949 ) , also known as the first order fermi acceleration process .",
    "according to this mechanism particles gain energy by bouncing off hydromagnetic disturbances frozen into the converging upstream and downstream flow regions near a shock . clearly , the understanding of this mechanism is critical for radiation models since the primary particle spectrum is one of their most important `` input '' characteristics .",
    "the success of this mechanism has been due to the following appealing features    1 .",
    "it reproduces the power - law energy spectra with an index remarkably similar to that inferred from the observations of the galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) @xcite .",
    "2 .   convincing , direct observational evidence of its operation at interplanetary shocks and the earth bow shock @xcite 3 .",
    "the absence of any obvious intrinsic limitation to the maximum particle energy achievable by this process    often , however , this mechanism is applied in its simplified version , the so called test particle ( tp ) or linear approximation ( that neglects the backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock structure and produces a simple @xmath1 particle energy distribution ) .",
    "although more realistic , some nonlinear theories do exist , they suffer from parameterization of particle transport coefficients such as the pitch - angle scattering , spatial diffusivity and plasma heating .    also , it should be emphasized that the statement ( 2 ) above is only a prima facie evidence for the responsibility of this mechanism for galactic crs , alluded to in ( 1 ) . despite similarity between physical parameters",
    "@xcite , the life - times and extensions of shocks in these two environments are vastly different ( up to a factor @xmath2 ) .",
    "this requires different approximations for these shocks .",
    "namely , the treatment of large astrophysical shocks such as supernova remnant ( snr ) shells , shocks in the lobes of radio galaxies or even larger shocks in clusters of galaxies _ must _ include the back reaction of accelerated particles on the shock structure , and thus be _ intrinsically nonlinear_. this , in turn , necessitates the selfconsistent treatment of the above mentioned anomalous transport phenomena .",
    "from the perspective of the widely accepted snr shock hypothesis of the origin of galactic crs , perhaps , the most critical impact of this treatment would be on the statement ( 3 ) above .",
    "it implies that the maximum energy is limited only by the time available for acceleration and by the size of accelerating object ( roughly not to be exceeded by the diffusive escape length for particles , which grows with energy ) .",
    "this is becoming a `` hot '' issue in view of the lack of evidence for tev - protons in snr shocks ( despite the signature of gev - protons , egret ) , which might indicate that the particle spectrum either cuts off somewhere between gev and tev energies ( in a currently uncovered by any instrument energy range ) or probably significantly steepens there .",
    "we must await observations from gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) and the next generation of the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes that are currently being built @xcite to see where and how the spectrum disappears or changes . to understand how this _",
    "may _ happen , one needs to consider all the crucial requirements for this mechanism , which are    * the ability of some fraction of thermal particles downstream to make the first step to acceleration , to return upstream ( injection problem ) * good confinement of accelerated particles near the shock front ( to continue energy gain ) * the ability of the shock to withstand the pressure of accelerated particles ( the shock smoothing , or shock robustness problem )    these requirements are also associated with the main difficulties of the theory and are , in fact , strongly related .",
    "we consider them briefly , in order .",
    "injection is the process of initial particle energization . within the widely accepted `` thermal leakage '' scenario of injection , the way protons",
    "enter the shock acceleration process is physically the same as when they are accelerated afterwards ( see , ref.@xcite ) . after thermalization downstream , certain fraction of particles will catch up with the shock .",
    "their further leakage upstream generates alfven waves via the cyclotron resonance @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the cosine of the proton pitch angle , and @xmath5 is the particle momentum .",
    "these waves do two things .",
    "first , they self - regulate the thermal particle leakage ( injection ) by trapping particles downstream when their leakage becomes too strong and therefore the wave amplitude too large as well @xcite .",
    "second , the large amplitude waves scatter already accelerating particles in pitch angle , thus ensuring their diffusive confinement near the shock .",
    "according to the above resonance condition , waves excited by protons ( with @xmath6 are too long to scatter electrons , so that they interact with them adiabatically ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , electrons need a separate injection scenario .",
    "one suggestion is that they might be injected via scattering on self - generated whistler waves @xcite . according to another mechanism suggested in ref.@xcite",
    ", electrons are extracted directly from the thermal pool near the shock front via their interaction with proton - generated lower - hybrid waves and electrostatic barrier formed there due to this interaction .",
    "it should be noted that when the both species become relativistic and , if the synchrotron cooling time is longer than the acceleration time , the electron spectrum should be identical to that of the protons .",
    "however , it is electrons for which we have convincing direct evidence of fermi acceleration in snr shells .",
    "there are well documented measurements of nonthermal electron emission in radio , @xmath8 rays and possibly also in @xmath9 rays , presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "although electrons play perhaps dynamically unimportant role in the shock structure , they should trace the dynamically important proton spectra .      as in the injection phase , further particle confinement near the shock",
    "is supported by self - generated alfven wave turbulence , since the energetic particle distribution ahead of the shock is ion - cyclotron unstable ( see , ref.@xcite ) . due to rapid pitch - angle scattering on these waves ,",
    "particles cross the shock repeatedly , thus gaining energy .",
    "clearly , the scattering frequency ( turbulence level ) sets up the acceleration rate .",
    "note that the existing background magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence in the interstellar medium ( ism ) would support only very slow acceleration .",
    "a long - standing problem is that the wave generation process is likely to be so robust that wave amplitude may far exceed the level admissible by the quasi - linear theory .",
    "it is usually expected that the turbulence saturates at a level @xmath10 .",
    "thus , particle scattering must occur via strongly nonlinear wave - wave and wave - particle interactions so that the conventional quasi - linear description should be replaced by a non - perturbative approach .",
    "mhd simulations significantly advanced recently ( see , eg @xcite and references therein ) but they would not suffice alone to self - consistently describe the wave generation by turbulently confined particles .",
    "the main difficulty is , as it will be seen in the sequel , the enormous extension of particle and wave spectra .",
    "it seems desirable to combine simulations in restricted but critical parts of the phase space ( as the short - wave , low - energy part that controlls the injection and the long - wave , high energy part where particle losses occur ) with an analytical approach in extended but tractable parts of the phase space where particle and wave spectra and even the flow profile exhibit relatively simple , scale invariant behaviour @xcite .",
    "it should be evident that a purely numerical approach would encounter serious difficulties if applied to the shock acceleration of uhecrs . indeed ,",
    "even if we had numerical solution of the problem of cr acceleration in snr shocks , up to energies @xmath11 ev , we would need to extend its dynamical range by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "since the integration domain in configuartion space is typically proportional to the maximum energy , this would mean @xmath13 times larger phase space .",
    "it seems natural to use this large size of the phase space instead of letting computer to process decade after decade of it with basically the same physics .",
    "the analytic approach that we introduce in sec.[kin - th ] below utilizes the corresponding small parameters and therefore appears particularly suitable to the problem of acceleration of uhecrs .      due to the secular growth of the pressure of accelerated particles ,",
    "the linear solution becomes invalid for shocks of sufficient life time , scale @xmath14 and magnetic field @xmath15 ( the most critical parameter is @xmath16 since the maximum particle energy scales as @xmath17 , provided that enough time is available for acceleration , as discussed , in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the main nonlinear effect is due to the back reaction of energetic particles on the flow which reduces the velocity jump at the flow discontinuity ( subshock ) through the deceleration and heating of the plasma in front of it ( in the so called cr precursor ) , fig.[fig : setup ] . the total shock compression , however , increases due to the decrease in the adiabatic index @xmath18 caused by the presence of relativistic particles and , even more importantly , by their escape from the system ( akin to radiative shocks ) .",
    "at the same time the maintenance of a finite subshock within the global shock structure ( subshock itself , plus cr precursor ) is critical to the injection process and thus for acceleration in general .",
    "a mathematical limitation of the tp approximation can be obtained in terms of particle energy and injection rate @xmath19 , namely , @xmath20 @xcite , which states that the pressure of accelerated particles must remain smaller than the shock ram pressure .",
    "it is also clear from this condition that the above three issues are strongly coupled .",
    "injection ( @xmath19 ) and particle confinement ( which sets @xmath21 ) determine the shock structure and are , in turn , regulated by it .",
    "the acceleration time scale @xmath22 ( or particle diffusivity @xmath23 ) and the precursor turbulent heating rate are also implicitly involved in this `` feedback loop '' .",
    "there are indeed too many shock variables to obtain reliable prediction by simply scanning the parameter space .",
    "therefore , they need to be calculated self - consistently before the particle spectra can be calculated and compared with the observations .",
    "a typical nonlinearly accelerating shock is illustrated in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "the most `` visible '' nonlinear effects are : ( 1 ) the deceleration of the flow upstream ( see the flow profile on the top of fig . [",
    "fig : setup ] ) by the pressure of accelerated particles , ( 2 ) subshock reduction , as a consequence ( its strength @xmath24 may become small compared to the total compression @xmath25 ( 3 ) bending of the b - field due to the compression of its tangential component because of the frozen in condition , @xmath26 , while the normal component is conserved due to @xmath27 .",
    "initially , the back reaction of accelerated particles ( crs ) on the shock structure was studied within the two - fluid model ( tfm ) .",
    "this model treats crs as a second fluid carrying the momentum and energy across the shock , but not the mass .",
    "complete solutions given in refs.@xcite indeed revealed a very strong back reaction of the crs onto the bulk plasma flow , leading to a bifurcation of the simple linear solution into a strongly nonlinear ( efficient ) solution with the acceleration efficiency approaching ( in strong shocks ) 100% due to the nonlinearly enhanced shock compression .",
    "this gives rise to a formally diverging ( in reality strongly dependent on the maximum energy ) cr pressure which makes the particle losses at the highest energies as important dynamically as injection , and strongly related to it through their feedback on the subshock strength .",
    "moreover , these losses are controlled by the alfven turbulence which , in turn , depends on the cr distribution in the shock precursor and thus on the losses themselves .",
    "unfortunately , the tfm , being a hydrodynamic theory , can not be closed in such a way that these essentially kinetic effects are properly represented .",
    "the earlier kinetic theories also demonstrated that _ upon accumulating enough cr energy , strong shocks develop into the nonlinear regime _ the minimal kinetic theory that captures bifurcations of the dsa can be formulated as follows .",
    "we describe the distribution of high energy particles ( crs ) by the so called diffusion - convection equation ( see , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the gaseous discontinuity ( the subshock ) is assumed to be located at @xmath28 and , for convenience , we flip the @xmath29- coordinate in fig.[fig : setup ] , so that the upstream side is @xmath30 half - space .",
    "thus , the flow velocity in the shock frame can be represented as @xmath31 where the ( positive ) flow speed @xmath32 jumps from @xmath33 downstream to @xmath34 across the subshock and then gradually grows upstream up to @xmath35 . in a steady state",
    "the equation can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the isotropic ( in the local fluid frame ) part of the particle distribution .",
    "this is assumed to vanish far upstream ( @xmath38 ) , while the only bounded solution downstream is obviously @xmath39 .",
    "the most plausible assumption about the cosmic ray diffusivity @xmath40 is that of the bohm type , @xmath41 ( the particle momentum @xmath5 is normalized to @xmath42 ) . in other words",
    "@xmath23 scales as the gyroradius , @xmath43 .",
    "the reference diffusivity @xmath44 depends on the @xmath45 level of the alfvenic turbulence that scatters the particles in pitch angle",
    ". the minimum value for @xmath44 would be @xmath46 if @xmath47 .",
    "note that the replacement of this plain parameterization by a selfconsistent solution for the spectrum of turbulence driven by an inhomogeneous distribution of accelerated particles is a challenge to plasma physics .",
    "the existing quasi - linear approaches clearly fail in the efficient acceleration regime due to unacceptable wave amplitudes .",
    "the determination of @xmath32 in eq.([c : d ] ) requires three further equations .",
    "the first one is the conservation of the momentum flux in the smooth part of the shock transition ( @xmath30 , in the cr - precursor ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the pressure of the high energy particles @xmath50 it is assumed here that there are no particles with momenta @xmath51 ( they leave the shock vicinity because there are no mhd waves with sufficiently long wave length @xmath52 , since the cyclotron resonance requires @xmath53 ) .",
    "the momentum region @xmath54 can not be described by equation ( [ c : d ] ) and the behavior of @xmath55 at @xmath56 is described by the injection parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the plasma density @xmath59 can be eliminated from equation ( [ mom : c ] ) by using the continuity equation @xmath60 .",
    "finally , the subshock strength @xmath61 can be expressed through the mach number @xmath62 at @xmath63 @xmath64 where the precursor compression @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the adiabatic index of the plasma .",
    "the system of equations ( [ c : d],[mom : c],[c : r ] ) describes in a self - consistent manner the particle spectrum and the flow structure , although under parameterization of such critical quantities as @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "our poor knowledge of the maximum momentum @xmath68 is related to the prescribed form of particle diffusivity @xmath69 .",
    "it is useful to reduce this system to one integral equation @xcite .",
    "a key dependent variable is an integral transform of the flow profile @xmath32 with a kernel suggested by an asymptotic solution of the system ( [ c : d])-([mom : c ] ) which has the form @xmath70\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the flow potential and the spectral index downstream @xmath72 .",
    "the integral transform is as follows @xmath73 du(\\psi ) \\ ] ] and it is related to @xmath74 through the following formula @xmath75 the physical meaning of the function @xmath76 is very simple .",
    "it reflects the degree of shock modification .",
    "namely , a function @xmath77 is an effective flow velocity upstream as seen by a particle with momentum @xmath5 that diffusively escapes ahead of the shock to a point @xmath29 where the flow speed is @xmath78 .",
    "once @xmath76 is found , both the flow profile and the particle distribution can be determined by inverting transform ( [ u ] ) and integrating equation ( [ q(p ) ] ) .",
    "now , using the linearity of equation ( [ mom : c ] ) ( @xmath79 ) , we derive the integral equation for @xmath80 by applying the transformation ( [ u ] ) to the @xmath81 derivative of equation ( [ mom : c ] ) @xcite .",
    "the result reads @xmath82 ^{-1}\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times   & \\frac{u(t_{0})}{u(t')}\\exp \\left [ -\\frac{3}{rr_{\\rm{s}}}\\int   _ { t_{0}}^{t'}\\frac{dt''}{u(t'')}\\right ] \\label{int : eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 , @xmath84 . here",
    "the injection parameter @xmath85 is related to @xmath86 by means of the following equation @xmath87 \\right\\ } ^{-1}\\label{nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equations ( [ c : r],[int : eq],[nu ] ) form a closed system that can be easily solved , numerically .",
    "asymptotic analytic solutions are also available @xcite .",
    "the physical quantities involved are : the far upstream mach number @xmath62 ( which is given , external parameter ) ; internal parameters : @xmath88 ( the mach number at the subshock ) , the injection rate @xmath19 , the particle maximum momentum @xmath89 , and particle diffusivity @xmath90 .",
    "these internal parameters must be determined self - consistently , but currently are parameterized or calculated using some simplifying assumption .",
    "for example , assuming that there is no turbulent heating in the shock precursor ( which is doubtful in such a turbulent environment ) , the parameter @xmath91 [ see eq.([c : r ] ) ] .",
    "the presence of bifurcation in this acceleration process is best seen in variables @xmath92 .",
    "the quantity @xmath93 is a measure of shock modification produced by crs , in fact @xmath94 [ eq.([mom : c ] ) ] and may be regarded as an order parameter .",
    "the injection rate @xmath67 characterizes the cr density at the shock front and can be tentatively treated as a control parameter .",
    "it is convenient to plot the function @xmath95 instead of @xmath96 [ using equations ( [ nu ] ) and ( [ c : r ] ) ] , fig.[fig : nuofr ] .",
    "in fact , the injection rate @xmath19 at the subshock should be calculated given @xmath97 with the self - consistent determination of the flow compression @xmath86 on the basis of the @xmath96 dependence obtained .",
    "however , in view of a very strong , even nonunique dependence @xmath96 , this solution can be physically meaningful only in regimes far from criticality , when @xmath98 ( test particle regime ) or @xmath99 ( efficient acceleration ) .",
    "there are , however , self - regulating processes that should drive the system _ towards critical region _",
    "( where @xmath96 dependence is very sharp ) @xcite .",
    "first , if @xmath19 is subcritical it will inevitably become supercritical when @xmath68 grows in course of acceleration .",
    "once it happened , however , the strong subshock reduction ( equation [ [ c : r ] ] ) will reduce @xmath19 as well and drive the system back to the critical regime , fig.[fig : bif ] .",
    "the maximum momentum @xmath68 is subject to self - regulation as well . indeed , when @xmath99 , the generation and propagation of alfven waves is characterized by strong inclination of the characteristics of wave transport equation towards larger wavenumbers @xmath100 on the @xmath101 plane due to wave compression .",
    "thus , considering particles with @xmath102 inside the precursor , one sees that they are in resonance with waves that must have been excited by particles with @xmath103 further upstream but , there are no particles with @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the required waves can be excited only locally by the same particles with @xmath102 which substantially diminishes the amplitude of waves that are in resonance with particles from the interval @xmath104 .",
    "( the left inequality arises from the resonance condition @xmath105 and the frequency conservation along the characteristics @xmath106 ) .",
    "this will worsen the confinement of these particles to the shock front .",
    "the quantitative study of this process is another challenge to the theory of plasma turbulence .",
    "what can be inferred from fig.[fig : nuofr ] now , is that the decrease of @xmath68 straightens out and rise the curve @xmath95 , so that it returns to the monotonic behaviour .",
    "however once the actual injection becomes subcritical ( and thus @xmath107 ) then @xmath68 will grow again restoring the two extrema on the curve @xmath95 .",
    "also the turbulent precursor heating straightens up the bifurcation diagram and returns it to the critical state .",
    "we illustrate this in fig.[fig : heat ] for different heating efficiencies @xmath108 , introduced phenomenologically through the decrease in the flow mach number across the cr precursor    @xmath109    here the first term is due to the familiar adiabatic compression while the second describes the turbulent heating , assumed to be proportional to the cr pressure contrast @xmath110 ( source of the free energy for turbulence ) as well as to the precursor length @xmath111 . the plots in figs .",
    "[ fig : nuofr],[fig : heat ] demonstrate that parameterization approaches in which the internal parameters ( like @xmath112 and @xmath113 in many simulations ) are treated as given may be useful only when ( and if ) these parameters are well outside the critical region which is marked by very sharp or even nonunique parameter dependence . for example , as seen from fig.[fig :",
    "heat ] , if @xmath112 ( which is essentially unknown ) lies within the interval @xmath114 , then there are no means to calculate the flow structure ( @xmath86 ) , and thus the particle spectrum with a reasonable accuracy . to treat the injection rate in the critical region as a `` control ''",
    "parameter is equally useless , figs .",
    "[ fig : nuofr],[fig : heat ] .",
    "it appears to be more productive to _ assume _ a _ marginal state _ in which the maximum and the minimum of @xmath95 merge , at least in a sense of an averaged ( in time and space ) process .",
    "this means that @xmath115 at some @xmath116 .",
    "these two equations and the dependence @xmath95 itself , not only determine @xmath117 and @xmath118 but also provide an additional relation that involve other parameters of the problem which clearly enter the function @xmath119 .",
    "these are the mach number @xmath62 , the heating rate @xmath112 and the maximum momentum @xmath120 .",
    "for example , given @xmath62 and @xmath112 we can easily calculate @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "these results show , that at least in shocks with high mach numbers and no significant turbulent heating , the nonlinear effects may significantly limit the maximum energy achievable by this acceleration mechanism . before any relevance of this result to ,",
    "the lack of observational evidence of tev protons in snr can be seriously debated , a number of difficult issues must be addressed which we discuss briefly in the next section .",
    "instead of relying on parameterization , and guessing about the possible values of relevant parameters it was suggested that , due to the self - regulation , the system should evolve precisely into the critical point within given parameter space @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive evaluation of this suggestion and the study of self - regulation mechanisms poses a serious challenge to plasma physics .",
    "note , however , that the critical self - organization approach was proven very useful in describing transport phenomena in laboratory plasmas , when the turbulence is generated by transport driving gradients , the pressure or density gradients , @xcite .",
    "the most important current issue is the construction of adequate links between the internal parameters ( and so the alfvenic turbulence ) , and their dependence upon the external parameters .",
    "this is an interdisciplinary problem in high energy astrophysics and nonlinear plasma physics .",
    "it combines hydrodynamics , particle kinetics with a strong emphasis on the theory of dynamical chaos and ergodicity ( injection ) , alfvenic turbulence , collisionless nonlinear plasma phenomena and , in particular , the theory of collisionless shocks",
    ".    currently not all the aspects of this problem are well understood .",
    "we believe that we understand how the acceleration operates in the test particle ( linear ) regime , and have an analytic description of nonlinearly modified shocks including particle spectra , although under a prescribed bohm - type particle diffusion .",
    "injection can be calculated currently only for a relatively strong subshock , while we need it for varying shock parameters of dynamically evolving cr shocks .",
    "turbulence dynamics , associated plasma heating and the turbulent transport of crs are understood to even lesser extent .",
    "a systematic determination of parameters involved should allow the self - consistent calculation of particle spectra .",
    "specifically , this requires detailed understanding of several physical phenomena in a shock environment , which include :    1 .",
    "generation of waves by energetic protons , wave transport and spectral evolution 2",
    ".   turbulent transport of protons , in space and momentum , injection 3 .",
    "electron injection triggered by proton generated turbulence 4 .",
    "heating by alfvenic and ( magneto- ) acoustic turbulence , which controls the global shock structure    the resolution of these issues will lead to the further progress in our understanding of particle acceleration and associated emission .",
