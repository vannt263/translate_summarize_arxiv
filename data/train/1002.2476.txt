    "* ) .    to address questions about the nature of dark energy and/or the properties of gravity on cosmological scales ,",
    "a number of ambitious wide - field optical and infrared imaging surveys have been proposed : the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) , the dark energy survey ( des ) , the large synoptic sky survey ( lsst ) , the space - based joint dark energy mission ( jdem ) , and the euclid .",
    "however , there are several sources of systematic errors inherent in weak lensing measurements , and understanding the systematic errors is currently the most important issue for achieving the full potential of planned lensing surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most dangerous systematic errors is the uncertainty in estimating redshifts of source galaxies . since it is practically infeasible to obtain spectroscopic redshifts for the huge number of imaging galaxies ( @xmath5@xmath6 galaxies for future surveys ) , redshifts of galaxies need to be estimated from multi - band photometry  the so - called photometric redshifts ( hereafter photo-@xmath0 ) .",
    "both statistical errors and systematic biases in the relation between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts need to be well controlled ( e.g. a sub - percent level for the bias for future surveys ) in order not to have any serious biases in cosmological parameters comparable with the apparent statistical errors @xcite .",
    "understanding the properties of photo-@xmath0 errors is also important in exploring an optimal survey design given the goal of achieving the desired level cosmological constraints ; depth vs number of filters vs area surveyed . given these research backgrounds",
    "there are recent studies on photo-@xmath0 requirement studies based on real data @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to focus on an issue of how to identify and remove catastrophic redshift errors  the case that photometric redshift is grossly misestimated ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the similar study ) .",
    "this can be done by monitoring the posterior likelihood function of photo-@xmath0 estimation for each galaxies .",
    "the important fact is that future surveys are planned to use the sample variance limited regime in cosmic shear information rather than the shot noise regime in order to constrain cosmology .",
    "therefore one can discard a large fraction of galaxies whose photo-@xmath0 estimations are less reliable @xcite .",
    "thus it would be worth addressing how to construct a galaxy subsample suitable for lensing experiments .",
    "having such a subsample of galaxies with reliable photo-@xmath0 estimates may also relax requirements on a spectroscopic training set to calibrate the residual photo-@xmath0 errors . in this paper",

    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to summary and discussion . unless explicitly stated we assume the concordance @xmath7cdm model consistent with the wmap 5-year results @xcite .",

    "the power spectrum measured from a galaxy survey has shot noise contamination arising from the finite sampling of galaxy images .",

    "galaxies are available in each bin for a subaru - type survey with @xmath311000 degree@xmath32 sky coverage .",
    "therefore the statistical errors of photo-@xmath0 are not problematic : the lensing power spectrum is primarily sensitive to the mean redshift of source galaxies . instead",

    "to assess the required photo-@xmath0 accuracies for lensing tomography , an important fact we should keep in mind is the lensing measurement for planned wide - field surveys is not shot noise limited .",
    "hence a significant fraction of galaxies with ill - defined photo-@xmath0 s can be discarded , without severely degrading parameter accuracies @xcite . with these considerations in mind",
    "we will in the following address how to define an adequate subsample of galaxies for a given multi - color data set .",
    "figure  [ fig : cl ] gives a quick summary of the impact of redshift uncertainty on the lensing power spectrum for no tomography case , i.e. a single redshift bin .",

    "( note that the following results are all computed using simulated galaxy catalogs that have different redshift distributions ) .",
    "the plot shows that a @xmath36 change in the mean redshift causes a @xmath37-level change in the power spectrum amplitude , and the amount of the change varies with multipoles due to the projection of the nonlinear matter power spectrum .",
    "this change can be compared with the effect of dark energy equation of state and the statistical errors at each multipole bin expected for the power spectrum measurement .",
    "clearly such a bias in the mean redshift is problematic for planned surveys .",
    "to assess the impact of photo-@xmath0 errors on cosmic shear tomography , we take the following procedure . first we simulate a mock catalog of galaxies that contain information on true redshifts , magnitudes in each filters and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for survey parameters we consider",
    ". then we estimate photometric redshifts ( hereafter often photo-@xmath0 ) for each simulated galaxies from its colors , yielding the photo-@xmath0 catalogs .",
    "a quick summary of the procedures used in making the mock photometric catalog is as follows :    1 .",
    "based on the results of cosmos photo-@xmath0 catalog @xcite , we first model the redshift distribution of galaxies as a function of the @xmath15-band magnitudes down to @xmath38 ( see   [ ssec : lf ] ) .",
    "2 .   use the synthetic galaxy spectral model , gissel98 , to generate a set of sed templates for each type of galaxy , where the age and star formation history are randomly varied ( see   [ ssec : spt ] ) .",
    "3 .   use the _ hyperz _ code to generate a mock photometric catalog of galaxies in which the spectral energy distribution and redshift are assigned to each galaxy . in doing this the catalog",
    "is made by imposing the conditions that the catalog satisfy the redshift - magnitude relation as well as reproduce an appropriate mixture of galaxy sed types which is consistent with the cosmos galaxy population ( see   [ ssec : hyperz ] ) .",

    "compute apparent magnitudes in each filter for each simulated galaxy by taking into account the filter transmission curve and the redshifted spectrum ( see   [ ssec : filter ] ) .",
    "the statistical magnitude errors are also added to the magnitude of each filter ( see   [ ssec : magerr ] ) .",
    "to make a realistic simulated catalog , we assume survey parameters ( depth , filter transmission curves , and so on ) that are chosen to well resemble the planned hsc survey .",
    "we also consider the external imaging data sets of @xmath39-band and/or nir to study how combining the different colors improves photo-@xmath0 accuracies .    in this paper",
    "we use the mock galaxy catalog containing about @xmath40 galaxies in the range @xmath41 .    in the following subsections",
    "we will describe the details of each procedure above , and a reader who is more interested in the results can skip these subsections and go to   [ sec : photoz ] .      to make a mock catalog we need to properly take into account the redshift distribution of galaxies , which varies with the range of magnitudes considered .",
    "for example , fainter galaxies are preferentially at higher redshifts .",
    "this is the so - called magnitude - redshift relation .",
    "we use the magnitude - redshift relation estimated from the cosmos catalog of galaxies selected by the subaru @xmath15-band magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the cosmos catalog provides currently the most accurate photometric redshifts because the photo-@xmath0 are estimated from 30 broad , intermediate , and narrow bands covering from uv , optical to mid infrared .",
    "also the photo-@xmath0 estimates are calibrated by the spectroscopic sub - sample .",
    "@xcite studied subsamples of photo-@xmath0 galaxies for different limiting magnitudes and showed that the resulting redshift distributions are well fitted by the polynomial form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the fitting parameters .",

    "the cosmos data is deep enough in the @xmath15-band , and safely considered as a magnitude limit sample for @xmath47 .",

    ", we used the publicly available code _",
    "hyperz_. in doing this we need to account for an appropriate mixture of different galaxy sed types .",

    "once the spectral energy distribution is specified for each simulated galaxy at redshift @xmath0 , it is straightforward to compute the apparent magnitudes for a given set of filters taking into account the redshifted spectrum at observed wavelengths . the photo-@xmath0 estimate is sensitive to the details of observational parameters : the wavelength coverage , the transmission curve of a given filter , the exposure time , the limiting magnitude , and so on .",
    "we consider the parameters that match those of the planned subaru hsc survey : our default filter set is @xmath56 ( hereafter the prime superscripts are sometimes omitted ) , and the @xmath57 limiting magnitudes ( @xmath58 aperture ) are set to @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath38 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , respectively , assuming the exposure time of 15 minutes for each pass - band , 3 days from new moon , and 1.2 airmass at the subaru telescope site .",
    "we also study how adding other bands , @xmath39-band data and nir data , into the optical data above can improve photo-@xmath0 accuracies .",

    "the column denoted by `` @xmath70 '' shows the fraction of galaxies selected when imposing the threshold on the goodness - of - fit for each galaxy .",
    "it is clear that this clipping discards only a small fraction of galaxies for all the cases of filter combinations .",

    "it can be found that the clipping method based on the photo-@xmath0 likelihood function of each galaxy can efficiently discard galaxies with ill - defined photo-@xmath0 s , especially when combined with the nir and @xmath39-band data .    to be more explicit , the upper panel shows how much fraction of galaxies are included in the subsample when discarding galaxies with @xmath77 greater than a given threshold denoted on the vertical axis .",

    "one can find that the photo-@xmath0 accuracy is improved compared to figure  [ fig : scatter ] .",
    "we are now in a position to use the photo-@xmath0 galaxy catalogs , constructed up to the preceding section , to make the trade - off analysis on the number of galaxies within a sample versus how `` clean '' the tomographic redshift intervals are .",
    "then we study the impact of photo-@xmath0 errors on parameter estimation assuming the hypothetical lensing tomography experiment .",
    "figure  [ fig : nzsp ] shows the redshift distributions of each tomographic bin made by subdividing the photo-@xmath0 galaxies into 3 intervals of photometric redshifts , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the redshift intervals are chosen such that each redshift intervals contain similar number densities for the original mock catalog of galaxies .",
    "note that the redshift binning is fixed in the following analysis for simplicity , which helps to compare the results of different galaxy catalogs .",
    "also note that three redshift bins are a minimal choice of lensing tomography for constraining the dark energy equation of state parameter `` @xmath3 '' to a reasonable accuracy by efficiently breaking parameter degeneracies in the lensing power spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the upper plot in figure  [ fig : nzsp ] shows the tomographic redshift distributions constructed from different photo-@xmath0 catalogs in figure  [ fig : scatter ] , where different panels correspond to the different sets of filters and the different clipping thresholds .",
    "the shaded regions in each panel show the photometric redshift distributions of galaxies , which have sharp cutoffs in the distributions due to the sharp redshift binning , while the solid line histograms show the underlying true redshift distributions .",
    "as can be found from the top - row panels , if all the galaxies are used , the resulting redshift distributions have significant overlaps between different redshift bins due to a significant contamination of photo-@xmath0 outliers for any combinations of filters .",
    "on the other hand , the middle- and bottom - row panels show that , when 40% or 70% of photo-@xmath0 outliers are discarded by imposing the corresponding thresholds on @xmath77 , respectively , the overlaps can be increasingly reduced . in particular , when the optical data is combined with the nir data such that those expected from the viking survey , the resulting subsamples have almost no overlap , if about @xmath82 of galaxies are discarded .",

    "it is clear that , without clipping ill - defined photo-@xmath0 galaxies , the bias and errors are significant .",
    "note that the redshift bias for no tomography case sometimes becomes smaller than in some tomographic bins ( especially highest redshift bins ) , because photo-@xmath0 outliers at low- and high - redshifts cancel out to some extent in no tomography case .",
    "as can be seen from the middle - row panels , when the restricted redshift range of @xmath93 is considered , a subsample with most accurate photo-@xmath0 s is obtained , because spectral features of galaxies , especially the lyman and 4000    breaks , are well captured by the sets of filters in this redshift range .",
    "we next propagate the errors of tomographic redshifts into the dark energy parameter @xmath3 , expected from the lensing power spectrum measurements , based on the fisher matrix formalism described in   [ ssec : fisher ] . to do this we address the following questions :    * the trade - off of dark energy constraint : the statistical accuracy of @xmath3 , @xmath94 , versus the offset of the best - fit value from the true value , @xmath95 .",

    "these can be studied by using the simulated galaxy catalogs .",
    "the statistical error of @xmath3 can be reduced by including more number of galaxies in the sample for a fixed range of working multipoles ( @xmath96 ) , because the shot noise is more suppressed . on the other hand ,",
    "a bias in the best - fit @xmath3 due to the photo-@xmath0 errors can be reduced by discarding photo-@xmath0 outliers , leaving a fewer number of galaxies in the subsample .",
    "hence a trad - off point in @xmath94 versus @xmath95 may be found by compromising these competing effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : bias1 ] shows the marginalized error @xmath94 and the amount of bias @xmath97 as a function of number densities of galaxies included in the corresponding galaxy subsamples .",
    "again note that we considered the lensing tomography with three tomographic bins for a sky coverage of 2000 square degrees .",
    "the smaller number densities in the horizontal axis correspond to subsamples of galaxies where more galaxies with ill - defined photo-@xmath0 s are discarded by imposing more stringent thresholds on @xmath77 , i.e. smaller threshold values of @xmath77 , in the clipping method .",
    "the different curves are for different combinations of filters . the error @xmath94 is computed from the underlying true redshift distribution , i.e. for the case with perfect photo-@xmath0 s , therefore specified by the number density in the horizontal axis .",
    "when @xmath98 , the best - fit value of @xmath3 can be away from the true one by more than the @xmath99 error ; even if the true model has the cosmological constant ( @xmath100 ) , the result of @xmath101 may be falsely inferred .",
    "hence a minimal requirement on photo-@xmath0 accuracies can be assessed from the condition @xmath102 .",
    "first , the plot shows that , as the subsample is restricted to galaxies with more accurate photo-@xmath0 s , i.e. the smaller number densities , the bias in @xmath3 is reduced to some extent . on the other hand ,",
    "the error @xmath94 is only slightly degraded because the constraint comes mainly from the sample variance limited regime for a given range of working multipoles ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "it is also shown that the bias can be reduced by adding the nir- and/or u - band data .",
    "however , the broadband data alone may not be sufficient to reduce the bias .",
    "the optimal range of redshifts needs to be considered , and a brighter subsample whose galaxies have higher @xmath4 values in each filter is preferred to sufficiently reduce the bias , as implied from the middle and right panels . depending on the available set of filters ,",
    "the compromising point can be obtained around the number densities @xmath104 $ ] arcmin@xmath105 , i.e. more than 60% of ill - defined photo-@xmath0 galaxies need to be discarded .",
    "it would also be worth noting that combining the lensing constraints with other dark energy probes such as the baryon acoustic oscillation experiment may allow to further calibrate photo-@xmath0 errors by breaking parameter degeneracies .",
    "we have so far paid special attention to how to eliminate photo-@xmath0 outliers in order to obtain a subsample of galaxies suitable for tomographic lensing measurements . however , due to the limitation of photo-@xmath0 accuracies , there may remain a residual bias in the tomographic redshift bins , even if photo-@xmath0 outliers are completely removed . to study this ,",
    "figure  [ fig : bias_out ] shows the results obtained by artificially discarding photo-@xmath0 outliers according to the clipping criteria @xmath106 with @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the figure shows that a bias in @xmath3 can not be fully eliminated even if the outliers are completely discarded .",
    "this implies that there remains a residual bias in the mean redshift for each tomographic bins due to asymmetric photo-@xmath0 errors around @xmath109 , therefore the residual biases would need to be calibrated , e.g. by using a spectroscopic training subsample ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative way to identify photo-@xmath0 outliers is using angular cross - correlations of galaxies between different photo-@xmath0 bins @xcite .",
    "as implied in fig .",
    "[ fig : nzsp ] , photo-@xmath0 errors cause overlaps of galaxies between different redshift bins . therefore photo-@xmath0 errors may cause non - vanishing cross - correlations of galaxies between different photo-@xmath0 bins , if the galaxies indeed have similar true redshifts , therefore are physically correlated with each other . in other words the cross - correlations can , albeit statistical , be used to monitor a contamination of photo-@xmath0 outliers . in this subsection",
    "we use our simulated photo-@xmath0 catalogs to estimate the expected signal - to - noise ratios for measuring the cross - correlations assuming the same survey parameters we have considered .    assuming the limber approximation , the angular power spectra of galaxies in the @xmath15- and @xmath110-th photo-@xmath0 bins are given as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the underlying true redshift distribution for the @xmath15-th photo-@xmath0 bin and @xmath21 is its mean number density . in the following",
    "we consider a sharp redshift binning in photo-@xmath0 space , however , the underlying true distributions generally have overlaps due to photo-@xmath0 errors .",
    "we here simply assume that the galaxy distribution in the @xmath15-th bin is related to the matter distribution via constant bias parameter @xmath113 , which is taken to @xmath114 for all the photo-@xmath0 bins for simplicity . to make this assumption reasonable ,",
    "we restrict the following analysis to a range of low multipoles @xmath115 .",
    "notice that the cross power spectra are not affected by shot noise .",
    "the strength of cross - correlations or redshift leakages can be quantified by the cross - correlation coefficients at each multipole : @xmath116 the coefficient @xmath117 implies significant cross - correlations between the @xmath15- and @xmath110-th bins compared to their auto - spectra , while @xmath118 means no cross - correlation or no leakage of photo-@xmath0 outliers into different bins .",
    "the total signal - to - noise ratios expected for measuring the cross - correlations can be estimated as @xmath119 here we simply assume the gaussian covariances to model the statistical errors in measuring cross power spectra from a survey .",
    "note that the error covariance includes the shot noise contamination via the auto spectra @xmath120 and @xmath121 . as for the minimum and maximum multipoles used in the summation",
    ", we adopt @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively .    figure  [ fig : ggcorr ] studies the angular cross - correlations for our fiducial survey parameters with 2000 square degree coverage . here",
    "we consider the photo-@xmath0 galaxy catalog selected with @xmath72 and @xmath76 , and adopt 35 redshift bins over @xmath124 with the bin width @xmath125 corresponding to a typical photo-@xmath0 error on individual galaxy basis .",
    "the upper - left triangle in each panel shows the correlation coefficients of cross - power spectra between the two different photo-@xmath0 bins , @xmath126 .",
    "the coefficients have large values around the diagonal terms , i.e. @xmath127 , because the photo-@xmath0 errors cause significant overlaps between neighboring redshift bins .",
    "compared with the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] , one can find that photo-@xmath0 outliers cause some isolated regions with significant correlation coefficients .",
    "the lower - right triangle shows the expected signal - to - noise ratios , @xmath4 , for measuring cross - correlations .",
    "the sufficiently high @xmath4 values , say greater than 10 , can be expected for redshift bins that have high correlation coefficients . thus monitoring",
    "the cross - correlations between different photo-@xmath0 bins may allow to further identify photo-@xmath0 outliers , in a statistical sense .",
    "however , the genuine power of cross - correlation method for eliminating the outliers or calibrating the photo-@xmath0 errors needs to be more carefully studied .    finally we remark on a more quantitative work done in @xcite , which studied , based on mock simulations , the use of cross - correlations of photometric galaxies with an overlapping spectroscopic sample to calibrate the redshift distribution of the photometric galaxies without using the photo-@xmath0 information .",
    "while the main purpose of this paper is not using the cross - correlations to identify photo-@xmath0 outliers , the promising result shown is that the redshift distribution can be well reconstructed by using a sufficiently _ large _ spectroscopic sample .",
    "however , one of the limiting factors realized is the reconstruction requires a sufficiently fine binning of spectroscopic redshifts , which tends to make the cross - correlation measurements noisy . therefore it would be interesting to study how the method can be further refined by combining the cross - correlation method and the photo-@xmath0 information , and the combined method may relax a requirement on the size of spectroscopic calibration sample .",
    "we also note that , as pointed out in @xcite , the cross - correlation method is affected by the lensing magnification bias , which may cause an apparent correlations between foreground and background galaxies even if there is no photo-@xmath0 errors to cause redshift overlaps .",
    "this effect also needs to be included , and mock simulations would be useful for such a study on the cross - correlation method .",
    "in this paper we have studied how photo-@xmath0 errors available from broadband multi - color data affect cosmological parameter estimation obtained from tomographic lensing experiment . to do this",
    ", we made the simulated mock galaxy catalog with photo-@xmath0 information constructed from the cosmos catalog .",
    "since the photo-@xmath0 errors are sensitive to survey parameters such as available filters , the depths , and so on , we considered in this paper the survey parameters to resemble the planned subaru hyper suprime - cam survey , which is characterized by the optical multi - passband data ( @xmath71 ) and the depth @xmath128 .",
    "we also studied how the photo-@xmath0 accuracy can be improved if combining the optical data with the @xmath39-band data expected from a cfht - type telescope and the nir ( @xmath73 ) data from the viking - type survey .",
    "however , the method developed in this paper can be readily extended to other weak lensing surveys .",
    "we particularly paid our attention to how to construct a galaxy subsample suitable for weak lensing tomography .",
    "we showed that photo-@xmath0 outliers can be efficiently identified by monitoring the posterior likelihood of redshift estimation for each galaxy : more exactly , the width of likelihood function defined by the second moment around the best - fit redshift parameter ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : secmom ] ] ) was used as an indicator of the photo-@xmath0 accuracy on individual galaxy basis .",
    "it was also shown that the photo-@xmath0 outliers can be more efficiently removed by restricting the ranges of working magnitudes and/or redshifts , and adding the @xmath39- and @xmath129 bands ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : scatter][fig : bias_scatter ] ) .    using the fisher matrix formalism",
    ", we estimated how the photo-@xmath0 errors in a defined galaxy catalog cause biases in cosmological parameters , especially the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown how the parameter biases can be reduced with discarding galaxies with ill - defined photo-@xmath0 estimates . however , with discarding more galaxies , the statistical accuracies of parameters are degraded due to the increased shot noise contamination .",
    "we found that the trade - off point , where the parameter bias becomes similar or smaller than the marginalized statistical error , can be achieved if a large fraction of ill - defined photo-@xmath0 galaxies ( @xmath1 ) are discarded and if combined with the @xmath39- and nir - band data sets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bias1 ] ) .    however , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias_out ] , even if photo-@xmath0 outliers are completely eliminated , there may remain a non - negligible , residual bias in the mean redshift of each tomographic bin because the scatters around the relation between photometric and true redshifts , @xmath130 , are not necessarily symmetric and therefore not perfectly canceled even after the average of galaxies in each redshift bin .",
    "therefore a careful calibration of the residual photo-@xmath0 errors will be inevitably needed for any future surveys @xcite .",
    "a powerful method for the photo-@xmath0 calibration is using a training spectroscopic subsample .",
    "naively , if a _ fair , representative _ spectroscopic subsample of imaging galaxies used in the lensing analysis is available , it allows a calibration of photo-@xmath0 errors .",
    "however , the size of such a spectroscopic sample required for achieving the meaningful dark energy constraint becomes very large ; for a lensing survey with sky coverage of more than 1000 sq .",
    "degrees , containing more than @xmath5 imaging galaxies , a subsample with more than @xmath131 spectroscopic redshifts is required @xcite .",
    "note that the currently largest redshift sample is given by the cosmos project containing @xmath132 redshifts .",
    "thus a survey collecting @xmath133 spectra , which is required for our sample fully calibrated , is observationally very expensive and almost infeasible , especially if redshifts of faint galaxies are needed .    on the other hand",
    ", there is a new method recently proposed @xcite , using a spectroscopic subsample of smaller size , which is not necessarily a fair , representative subsample of imaging galaxies .",
    "first spectroscopic galaxies are compared to imaging galaxies in multi - dimensional color space , rather than the photo-@xmath0 space .",
    "secondly the ratio between number densities of spectroscopic and imaging galaxies is computed at each point in multi - color space . then the ratio is multiplied to the redshift distribution of spectroscopic subsample to infer the underlying redshift distribution of imaging galaxies .",
    "thus this weighting method may allow the photo-@xmath0 calibration using a spectroscopic subsample of smaller size . however , there is still an open issue to be carefully investigated in this method .",
    "for example , it is unclear how the calibration degrades if the spectroscopic subsample has significant sample variance fluctuations in the redshift distribution , e.g. due to clustering contamination at particular redshifts due to a finite area coverage .",
    "another calibration method is using cross - correlations of galaxies in photo-@xmath0 bins , as partly studied in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggcorr ] .",
    "again the non - vanishing cross - correlations only arise when the photo-@xmath0 errors cause leakages into different bins of true redshifts . or spectroscopic galaxies in the same survey region , if available , can also be used to cross - correlate with imaging galaxies in order to calibrate the photo-@xmath0 errors over a range of redshifts covered by the spectroscopic sample @xcite",
    ". however spectroscopic galaxies may be correlated with only particular types of galaxies , therefore , this method may have a limitation .",
    "hence it would be interesting to explore how to calibrate the redshift distribution of imaging galaxies down to the required accuracy level by combining various methods , the method developed in this paper and the methods based on spectroscopic subsample or / and cross - correlation measurements .",
    "finally we comment on another important contaminating effect , the intrinsic alignment in galaxy shapes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as studied in detail in @xcite ( also see *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , accurate photo-@xmath0 information is needed to calibrate and/or correct for the intrinsic alignment contamination in weak lensing tomography .",
    "a subsample with reliable photo-@xmath0 s , constructed based on the method in this paper , may be also useful for this purpose .",
    "we would like to thank rachel mandelbaum and the members of the hyper suprime cam weak lensing working group for useful discussions and comments .",
