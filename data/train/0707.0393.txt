    "supernovae ( sne ) hold the key to several open astrophysical questions . in particular , sne are the main source of heavy elements , and their energy input to the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a vital ingredient in galaxy formation ( e.g. , yepes et  al .",
    "learning the nature of the progenitors of different sn types , the sn rates , and the sn distributions in both space and cosmic time , are essential steps toward understanding metal enrichment and galaxy formation ( e.g. , kobayashi , tsujimoto & nomoto 2000 ) , and will be a prime topic of study with the james webb space telescope .",
    "it is widely believed that sne  ia arise from the explosions of white dwarfs ( wds ) in binary systems , while all other sn types result from massive - star core collapse ( e.g. , filippenko 1997 ; gal - yam et  al .",
    "2007 ; li et  al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "core - collapse sne ( cc - sne ) therefore explode promptly ( @xmath9  myr ) after the formation of a stellar population , and the cc - sn rate will trace the star - formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "in contrast , sne  ia should occur only after wd formation and binary evolution , with a `` delay '' of order 0.110  gyr .",
    "the sn  ia rate vs. cosmic time will therefore be a convolution of the sfh with a `` delay function ''  the sn  ia rate following a brief burst of star formation .",
    "the progenitors of sne  ia have not been identified , and could be wds accreting from main - sequence companions , sub - giants , or giants , or alternatively `` double - degenerate '' wd pairs that merge ( e.g. , hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "each of these scenarios predicts a different delay function ( e.g. , kobayashi et  al . 1998 ; madau , della valle & panagia 1998 ; yungelson & livio 1998 ; belczynski , bulik & ruiter 2005 ; greggio 2005 ; see recent updates in panagia , della valle & mannucci 2007 ) , which in turn dictates the sn rate vs. redshift . for the local universe , current estimates of sn rates ( e.g. , cappellaro , evans & turatto 1999 ; mannucci et  al . 2005 ; sharon et  al .",
    "2007 ) are still uncertain , but improving substantially ( leaman , li , & filippenko 2007 , in preparation ) . at @xmath10 , a number of",
    "sometimes conflicting measurements exist ( pain et  al .",
    "2002 ; gal - yam , maoz & sharon 2002 ; tonry et  al . 2003 ; dahlen et  al . 2004 ; cappellaro et  al . 2005 ; barris & tonry 2006 ; neill et  al . 2006 ; sullivan et  al .",
    "2006b ) .",
    "recent attempts to constrain the cosmic sfh and the sn  ia delay function using sn rates have yielded some intriguing results .",
    "gal - yam et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) carried out the first measurement of cluster sn  ia rates at @xmath11 and @xmath12 using deep ( @xmath13  mag ) archival _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ images of eight massive clusters . in maoz & gal - yam ( 2004 ) ,",
    "the measured rates were compared to predictions normalized by the requirement that sne  ia produce the observed mass of iron in clusters .",
    "the low observed rate at @xmath14 implies that the sne needed to produce the iron exploded at earlier times , arguing against models with long sn  ia time delays , which predict sn rates ten times higher than observed .",
    "thus , cluster iron production by sne  ia appeared to be a viable option only if sne  ia have relatively short ( @xmath15  gyr ) time delays .",
    "in contrast , comparison of the sn  ia rate vs. @xmath7 in the _ field _ to the cosmic sfh has generally suggested a _ long _ delay time ( pain et  al .",
    "2002 ; tonry et  al .",
    "2003 ; gal - yam & maoz 2004 ; strolger et  al . 2004 ; see , however , barris & tonry 2006 , who find evidence for a short delay ) .",
    "these results may therefore point to cc - sne from an early generation of star formation with a top - heavy initial mass function , rather than sne  ia , as the source of cluster enrichment .    however , a re - analysis by frster et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) of the _ hst_-based great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) data of strolger et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , originally obtained to measure the expected early deceleration of the universe ( riess et  al .",
    "2004a ) , indicates that these conclusions may be strongly dependent on the assumed sfh .",
    "furthermore , evidence has surfaced that there may be two separate sn  ia channels , a `` prompt '' ( @xmath16  gyr ) channel and a `` tardy '' ( @xmath17  gyr ) one ( mannucci et  al .",
    "2005 ; scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ; mannucci , della valle & panagia 2006 ) .",
    "a single delay distribution that is peaked at short delays but includes a long tail extending to large delays may be able to reproduce most of the current data .",
    "nevertheless , some rate measurements at similar redshifts are discrepant by large factors ( e.g. , pain et  al .",
    "2002 vs. barris & tonry 2006 ) .",
    "there is ongoing debate as to whether incompleteness or contamination of sn samples are affecting the low or high - rate measurements , respectively .",
    "the decrease in the field sn  ia rate at @xmath18 measured by dahlen et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) and strolger et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , if real , does not permit the existence of the prompt sn  ia component indicated by the high sn  ia rate seen in star - forming galaxies ( mannucci et  al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ; sullivan et  al .",
    "scannapieco & bildsten ( 2005 ) have actually predicted that this apparent decrease will disappear with improved data .",
    "barris & tonry ( 2006 ) have argued that the claims for long delay times depend strongly on the presence of very few sne at the highest redshifts in the goods survey .",
    "indeed , small - number statistics are a major limiting factor in all current estimates of sn rates at high @xmath7 .",
    "progress in this field requires larger high-@xmath7 sn samples than presently available .",
    "however , with typical magnitudes of @xmath192526 , samples of high-@xmath7 sne are currently difficult to confirm ( or classify ) spectroscopically .",
    "photometric classification of sne has been shown do be a viable option by poznanski et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and further explored since then ( e.g. , gal - yam et  al .",
    "2004b ; riess et  al . 2004b",
    "; sullivan et  al .",
    "recently , poznanski , maoz & gal - yam ( 2007 , hereafter p07 ) have developed an automatic bayesian algorithm for the purpose of classifying sne with single - epoch photometry .",
    "the major novelties in the approach of p07 lie in the probabilistic classification , and the ability to quantify the success fractions , uncertainties , and biases of photometric sn typing .",
    "this opens the possibility for surveys for large numbers of sne , and their classification , using solely single - epoch , ground - based , imaging .    in this paper",
    ", we present initial results from a survey in which we attempt this new approach for obtaining large high-@xmath7 sn samples . the survey is conducted by re - imaging the subaru deep field ( sdf ; kashikawa et  al .",
    "2004 , hereafter k04 ) in three bands .",
    "keck spectroscopy of over half of the sn hosts , and for several hundred galaxies similar to the hosts , is used to estimate the reliability of our photometric redshifts .",
    "the photometry of the sne and their hosts is used to classify the sne with the algorithm of p07 .",
    "as we show below , we identify 33 sne , classified as either type ia or core collapse , with redshifts out to @xmath20 , a number and redshift range comparable to those in the _ hst_/goods sample . while the redshift distributions of the samples are consistent , there is a trend for more high-@xmath7 sne  ia in the sdf .",
    "we derive the sn  ia rate , in four redshift bins , and find that while it is consistent , to within errors , with previous results , at redshift @xmath21 it is about 50% higher than the value determined based on goods data , and at redshift @xmath22 the rate we find is lower than that of goods .",
    "we are currently in the process of increasing our sn sample by obtaining additional epochs of the sdf , with the objective of acquiring a sample of several hundred high-@xmath7 sne .",
    "those observations and their analysis will be described in future papers .",
    "our sn survey is carried out in the sdf ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ; j2000 ) . the reference images for this field , obtained with the suprime - cam camera on the subaru 8.2-m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii ,",
    "are described by k04 .",
    "suprime - cam is a @xmath25 mosaic of @xmath26 ccds at the prime focus of the telescope , with a field of view of @xmath27 , and a scale of @xmath28 .",
    "this reference epoch of the sdf was obtained by deep imaging , in five broad - band filters ( @xmath29 ) and two narrow - band filters ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , of an area of @xmath32 , down to @xmath33 limiting magnitudes of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 limits of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ; here and throughout the paper , all magnitudes are on the ab system ; oke & gunn 1983 ) . the imaging for the reference sdf epoch was carried out between april 2002 and april 2003 , with some preliminary data collected in 2001 , as described by k04 .",
    "we re - imaged the field on 2005 march 5 and 6 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) , in the three reddest suprime - cam broad bands : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath2 .",
    "these bands were selected as being the most efficient for finding high - redshift sne , and for later classification ( e.g. , poznanski et  al .",
    "2002 ; gal - yam et  al .",
    "2004b ; riess et  al . 2004b ) .",
    "we obtained 22 exposures of @xmath47  s each in @xmath45 , 36 of @xmath48  s each in @xmath46 , and 76 of @xmath49  s each in @xmath2 , for a total of @xmath50  s ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath51  s ( @xmath46 ) , and @xmath52  s ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we followed a dithering pattern similar to the one described by k04 .",
    "our seeing throughout the observations averaged @xmath53 in all three bands , ranging from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "we also observed the field with the mosaic - i wide - field imager on the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4-m mayall telescope , on 2005 march 2 , april 5 , and june 8 , and on 2006 june 19 .",
    "the mosaic - i camera consists of eight ccds with a pixel size of @xmath56 ( muller et  al .",
    "1998 ) , covering a field of view of @xmath57 .",
    "each observation was in white light ( i.e. , unfiltered ) , typically 1.52 hr long , split into dithered subexposures , with a median seeing of about @xmath55 .",
    "compared to the @xmath45 band , the unfiltered observations increase the throughput of stellar sources , depending on their colours , by a factor of 24 , and also increase the level of the sky background by a factor of 48 , depending on conditions .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is therefore multiplied by @xmath58 . consequently , in many cases , unfiltered observations permit obtaining a deeper image , closer to the depth reached with the larger - aperture subaru telescope , albeit with no colour information .",
    "the 4-m data provide us with monitoring over longer times , which is important for identifying variable active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , the main contaminant in our sn search ( see  [ search ] ) .",
    "the _ hst _ archive includes advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images of a small portion of the sdf , which we use to examine the morphology of one sn host galaxy that lies in this field .",
    "the data were obtained with _",
    "hst_/acs in 2002 , on five separate occasions between may 20 and july 3 , in the f850lp band as part of program go-9075 ( pi : s. perlmutter ) .",
    "the total exposure time is @xmath59  s.    subaru data were reduced following k04 , using the suprime - cam pipeline _ sdfred _ ( yagi et  al .",
    "2002 ; ouchi et  al .",
    "2004 ) , and involving the following main steps .",
    "the individual frames were overscan subtracted , flat fielded using superflats , distortion corrected , matched to a common point - spread function ( psf ) of @xmath60 , sky subtracted , registered , and combined .",
    "the combined image was then matched to the reference image by using the _ _ astrometrix _ _ code to find the astrometric correction , and the iraf ( tody 1986 ) task _ wregister _ was used to register the two images .",
    "inducing psf degradation to the new images may appear questionable , since it reduces the frame depth and could adversely affect the subsequent image subtraction .",
    "however , probably because our reference epoch was reduced in such a manner , we found that the optimal image subtraction , with the least numbers of artificial residuals , was obtained by following the same procedure .",
    "the photometric calibration of the first - epoch images was done by k04 , reaching a precision for the zero points of about 0.05 mag .",
    "we calibrated our images relative to the first epoch by comparing the photometry of all the objects detected in both epochs .",
    "the mean of the differences between the two measurements was taken to be the difference in zero points .",
    "the final images reach @xmath61 limits ( defined as in k04 ) of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 limits of @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , and @xmath68 ) , shallower than the reference image by @xmath69  mag  ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath70  mag  ( @xmath46 ) , and @xmath70  mag  ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "reduction of the kpno images was done using the iraf package _ mscred _ , following the same steps as with the subaru data , except that psf degradation was not applied .",
    "the final images reach @xmath61 limiting magnitudes corresponding approximately to @xmath71  mag ( @xmath65 limits of @xmath72  mag ) , depending on the epoch .",
    "the depth reached implies a s / n improvement in the filterless data , relative to @xmath45-band imaging , of a factor near 2 , for two of our epochs , and only a minor gain for the remaining two .",
    "_ hst _ images were reduced using the pyraf script _ multidrizzle _ ( koekemoer et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "we performed psf matching and image subtraction between the new and reference subaru images in all bands , and between the four kpno epochs , using both the software isis ( alard & lupton 1998 ; alard 2000 ) and the common psf method ( cpm ; gal - yam et  al .",
    "2004a ; gal - yam et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "briefly , isis minimizes a spatially variable convolution kernel that degrades the psf of the better - seeing image to the psf of the worse - seeing image .",
    "cpm convolves each image with the measured psf of the other , and thus the final psf of both images is worse than the initial psf of either image , but kernel - matching , and its inherent uncertainties in the presence of noise and pixellation , are avoided .",
    "both procedures produce output images with nominally identical psfs , while introducing a minimal amount of noise . while isis is robust and stable",
    ", we find that in some cases it tends to produce more subtraction artefacts than cpm , mimicking sne near the cores of bright galaxies .",
    "we have therefore used both codes .    as a consequence of the dithering ,",
    "the final images have a field of view of @xmath73 , but with a substantial region along the edges where the s / n is significantly smaller .",
    "this is due to the different effective exposure on the fringes of the field .",
    "we therefore trim down the difference image to 81% of its full size , and remain with a total differenced area of @xmath74 ( which is , in fact , the size of the suprime - cam field ) .",
    "we obtained spectra of some of our sn host galaxies ( see  [ hosts ] ) , and of several hundred random galaxies in the sdf .",
    "observations were carried out on 2007 january 12 , january 22 , march 16 , and april 12 , using the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et  al .",
    "1995 ) on the keck  i telescope for the first night , and the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; faber et  al .",
    "2003 ) on the keck ii telescope for the three other nights .",
    "eight unique object masks and positions where used , with up to 12 host galaxies per mask ( including also targets from subaru observations in february 2007 , which are not analysed in this paper ) , and several tens of random galaxies per mask .",
    "each mask was typically observed for @xmath75  s.    the lris mask was observed with the 600 line mm@xmath76 grism blazed at 4000   , and the 400 line mm@xmath76 grating blazed at 8500   , together with the d560 dichroic .",
    "this typically yields a wavelength range of @xmath19300010,000   , but the specific position of the slit on the mask shifts the wavelength range for each individual spectrum .",
    "the spectra have resolutions of @xmath193.5    and @xmath197.0    for the blue and red sides , respectively .",
    "all but one of the deimos masks were observed with the 600 line mm@xmath76 grating blazed at 7500   , and the gg495 order - blocking filter .",
    "we chose a wavelength range of @xmath19500010,000   , with the precise limits depending on each individual spectrum ( different slit positions ) .",
    "one mask was designed to target @xmath77 galaxies as well as slightly higher - redshift sn hosts ( see  [ hosts : z ] ) . for this mask , we observed with the 600 line mm@xmath76 grating and the og550 order - blocking filter , with a central wavelength of about 8000   .",
    "this yielded a typical wavelength range of 550010,500   , without second - order contamination at longer wavelengths , due to the different filter .",
    "the 600 line mm@xmath76 grating yields a full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) resolution of @xmath191.5   , or @xmath19150  km  s@xmath76 , at 7500   .",
    "this resolution is sufficient to resolve many night - sky lines and the [ ] @xmath783726 , 3729 doublet .",
    "resolving night - sky lines is useful for finding emission lines in the reddest part of the spectrum , where sky lines are blended in low - resolution spectra .",
    "resolving the [ ] doublet allows us to confidently identify an object s redshift even with a `` single '' line .",
    "the deimos data were reduced using a modified version of the deep2 data reduction pipelinecooper / deep / spec2d/ ] , which bias corrects , flattens , rectifies , and sky subtracts the data before extracting a spectrum ( foley et  al .",
    "the lris data were reduced using a combination of typical iraf techniques and our own idl procedures ( foley et  al .",
    "the wavelength solutions were derived by low - order polynomial fits to the lamp spectral lines , and shifted to match night - sky lines at the positions of the objects .",
    "standard - star spectra were obtained through a long slit on the same night , and were used to flux calibrate the spectra and remove telluric absorption ( matheson et  al . 2001 ) . to obtain the proper absolute flux scale and to correct for minor continuum differences due to slit losses ,",
    "the spectra were scaled to match the @xmath45-band and @xmath46-band photometry of the galaxies .",
    "the @xmath2-band difference image obtained using isis was scanned by eye to search for variable and transient objects in the new image .",
    "morokuma et al .",
    "( in preparation ) will present a study of the various variable objects they detect within the subframes that constitute our reference image set .",
    "they have also identified nearly a thousand agns in the sdf based on their long - term @xmath46-band variability . in our search , these galaxies were therefore ignored ( clearly non - nuclear variable sources in these objects were searched for , but none was found ) .",
    "the remaining variable candidates were examined as follows , in order to reject other non - sne .    1 .",
    "we compared the @xmath2-band difference images relative to the reference sdf epoch for the first and second nights of the data separately , to identify and reject moving objects ( asteroids ) and possible subtraction artefacts and noise peaks .",
    "2 .   isis and cpm subtraction images were compared to test for possible subtraction artefacts , especially near bright galaxies .",
    "candidates that had distorted or otherwise suspicious shapes in the isis subtraction image , and were clearly absent from the cpm image , were rejected .",
    "kpno subtraction images were used to identify agns based on their non - sn - like ( e.g. , slowly rising ) light curves . for 10 of our candidates , at the bright end of the distribution , we have detections also in one or more of the kpno images , with a photometric behavior consistent with sne , i.e. , declining on time scales of a month or two .",
    "4 .   for every candidate found in the @xmath2 band , subtraction images in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 bands were also examined , and objects which showed suspect residual shapes , indicative of a subtraction artefact , were rejected .",
    "we note that no candidate was rejected because of a non - detection in one band or another , since at least some high-@xmath7 sne are expected to be very faint or undetected in the observed - frame @xmath45 and @xmath46 bands .",
    "we further note that the purity of our sn sample will increase retroactively as we obtain additional epochs of this field , and identify any remaining agns that may still contaminate the sample .      in order to assess our detection efficiency , artificial point sources , with characteristics matching as closely as possible those of the sn population ,",
    "were planted blindly in the @xmath2-band image and were searched for , together with the real transients .",
    "the simulated sample was constructed as follows .",
    "first , we calculated the photometric redshifts of the entire galaxy sample in the sdf ( about 150,000 objects ; see k04 ) , using the bayesian photometric redshift ( photo-@xmath7 ) code bpz ( bentez 2000 ) .",
    "briefly , bpz fits a set of template galaxies to the photometry , with the possibility to use a prior on the redshift .",
    "we used the same 6 template galaxies as bentez ( 2000 ) , from coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ) and kinney et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) . as a prior we took the redshift distribution of galaxies in the hubble deep field , which has a depth comparable to that of the sdf ( fernndez - soto , lanzetta & yahil 1999 ) .",
    "the errors given by bpz were used to select a subsample with relatively robust redshifts ( i.e. , small nominal uncertainties ) , while requiring the selected galaxies to have a redshift distribution similar to the one found in the hubble deep field .",
    "a discussion of the photo-@xmath7 determination for the actual sn host galaxies , along with our spectroscopic training set , are presented in  [ hosts ] .    in order to account for the population of galaxies which are below our limiting magnitude , but can still host sne , we extrapolated , in every redshift bin , the galaxy population using a schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function and assigned those extrapolated galaxies random positions within our field .",
    "sn rates are expected to roughly follow the luminosities of the galaxies .",
    "we approximated the luminosity of each galaxy using its magnitude and luminosity distance ( assuming here , and throughout the paper , cosmological parameters @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) .",
    "these luminosities were used to weight each galaxy s probability to host a sn .",
    "the position of the simulated sne within each host galaxy was again set to follow the light .",
    "we defined for each galaxy , using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , 10 annuli , each containing one - tenth of the total flux of the galaxy .",
    "the radial position of the simulated sne was randomly drawn to lie inside one of those 10 annuli . while the annuli are circular , the hosts are generally not . to approximately compensate for this",

    "more than 80% of the 1000 simulated sne are in the interesting magnitude range , between 25 and 27 , where a good sampling of the efficiency curve is important .",
    "we have tested the effect of replacing the gaussian profile of the fake sne by an empirical profile measured from the image , using different template stars for different portions of the image , and found no changes in the efficiency compared to our previous simulations .",

    "however , goods is a complete sample , without any subsequent selection .",
    "our survey and goods have different effective areas and observing strategies , for which we need to account prior to comparison . in terms of bands ,",
    "the surveys are similar .",
    "the filter - plus - system bandpasses of the suprime - cam @xmath2 filter and of the _ hst _ f850lp filter ( used by goods ) have effective wavelengths at @xmath93  and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the goods detection efficiency function , as described by strolger et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , is slightly deeper than our own , by about 0.10.2 mag .",
    "we consider only sne brighter than our 50% efficiency limit , @xmath64  mag . for @xmath2-band magnitudes brighter than 26.3 ,",
    "both surveys have similar efficiencies , and no correction is needed for a comparison to be made , if we exclude the fainter goods sne .",
    "the sdf covers @xmath95 , and has a single epoch , since we searched for sne only in the march 2005 images .",
    "goods covered @xmath96 , imaged at five epochs , each separated by about 45 days , i.e. , 24 weeks in the typical sn rest frames .",
    "this means that the epochs are not independent and can not be simply summed , since most sne are discovered early and are detected in more than one epoch . from the photometry in riess",
    "( 2004a ) and strolger et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we find that , out of 42 sne , 38 are detected ( i.e. , brighter than 26.3 mag , our sdf cutoff magnitude ) in @xmath97 epochs , on average , while the remaining 4 are too faint .",
    "thus , the effective goods area is roughly @xmath98 , about 15% more than the sdf . hence , for a direct comparison of the two samples , the number of goods sne needs to be trimmed down from 38 to @xmath99 . due to this reduction factor",
    ", we will present non - integer numbers of sne from goods in the discussion below .",
    "thus , after the normalization for the different effective areas , there are ( coincidentally ) exactly the same number of sne in our sample and in the `` sdf - normalized '' goods sample ( 33 ) , 18.9 of which are sne ia ( compared to the most probable value of 18.5 in the sdf debiased sample ) and 14.1 cc - sne ( most probable value 14.5 in the sdf ) . in figure [ f : zdist ] , we compare the redshift distributions for the sn  ia and cc - sn subsamples from the two surveys .",
    "since one of the cc - sne in the goods sample ( sn 2002fv ) has no redshift information , we exclude it from this comparison . as can be seen , the two samples agree well in total size , in total type fractions , and in the cc - sn redshift distribution .",
    "however , the redshift distributions may differ for the sne  ia .",
    "our lowest - redshift sn  ia is at @xmath6 , while goods found sne  ia down to @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , the sne  ia in our sample reach higher redshifts , up to @xmath3 , rather than @xmath101 , in the `` sdf - normalized '' goods sample . while formally the distributions",
    "are consistent , our data could indicate that the results in strolger et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) and dahlen et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) concerning the paucity of sne  ia at high @xmath7 , and the implications for the sn  ia delay time , may change once larger samples are obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "one of our high-@xmath7 sne  ia , snsdf@xmath102 , at @xmath103 , is hostless , and its redshift is based solely on the posterior fit from the sn - abc to the sn photometry .",
    "if this redshift is in error , the number of sne  ia in the highest - redshift bin would be more similar to that of goods . at @xmath104 ,",
    "where the fraction of sne  ia in our sample was most significantly reduced by the debiasing of our photometrically classified sample , lies the largest disagreement between competing measures of the sn  ia rates .",
    "barris & tonry ( 2006 ) , who used photometric methods to classify sne , found a rate 45 times higher than measured by pain et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and neill et  al .",
    "neill et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) have suggested that the sample of barris & tonry ( 2006 ) may have suffered from contamination by cc - sne . our raw sample of sne  ia in that same bin , without debiasing ,",
    "would certainly be contaminated by cc - sne .",
    "the sn redshift distributions that we have derived can be used to set constraints on the sfh and sn  ia delay functions . however",
    ", our sn sample is still small , and considering the similarity in the redshift distributions of the sdf and goods cc - sn samples , we postpone a cc - sn rate derivation to future papers .",
    "nevertheless , we calculate sn  ia rates , to examine how the differences in the distributions noted in  [ s : goods_comp ] propagate into the underlying rates .",
    "we calculate the volumetric rate of sne  ia , in four bins , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the number of sne  ia in bin @xmath107 , and @xmath108 and @xmath109 are , respectively , the survey control time ( see below ) and the co - moving volume element ( in mpc@xmath110 ) , as a function of redshift @xmath7 .",
    "the integration is done within the limits of each bin .",
    "the control time , @xmath108 , is found as follows .",
    "for every redshift @xmath7 , we calculate the model @xmath2-band sn  ia light curve , @xmath111 , and sum over the survey efficiency , @xmath112 , at these magnitudes : @xmath113 the effective redshift of each bin , @xmath114 , is defined as @xmath115 i.e. , a mean redshift weighted by the volume and the control time .",
    "the uncertainties are the poisson and classification uncertainties of the sample , added in quadrature . to investigate how errors in the efficiency function plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : eff ] might propagate to our rate measurement , we have fitted the efficiency curve with a fermi - dirac - like step - function , derived the uncertainties in its parameters , and have repeated the rate calculation hundreds of times with randomly drawn efficiency curves .",
    "the resulting @xmath82 dispersion in the sn rates is of the order of @xmath116mpc@xmath110yr@xmath76 , i.e. , about 30 times smaller than the main sources of uncertainty .",
    "if , for some unknown reason , our detection efficiency curve is offset by @xmath117  mag , the derived rates would change by about 15% , again less than the main sources of uncertainty . a significantly larger shift of the efficiency function , e.g .",
    ", by 0.3  mag toward bright magnitudes , would lower the efficiency to near zero at @xmath64  mag , and would be inconsistent with our having discovered sne in this magnitude range ( unless , of course , the intrinsic number of sne rises sharply precisely at this brightness )",
    ". we further neglect dust extinction in this rough derivation of the rate .",
    "as found by riello & patat ( 2005 ) and neill et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , such an omission causes the rates to be underestimated by @xmath1925% at most , which is smaller than the uncertainties already taken into account .",
    "we also do not attempt at this point to incorporate sne with different stretch values into the control - time calculation , which should have a negligible ( if any ) effect ( e.g. , neill et  al .",
    "the resulting rates are listed in table  [ t : dist ] .",
    "figure  [ f : rate ] shows the rates compared to other published results ( as compiled by neill et  al .",
    "2006 ) , with the sfr from hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) plotted to guide the eye .",
    "the sfr is scaled to fit the low - redshift ( @xmath118 ) measurements , where there are fewer conflicting estimations .    in our lowest - redshift bin",
    "we have found no sne  ia .",
    "consequently , the error bar marks the upper limit arising from classification uncertainty only . assuming the rate is in the range @xmath119yr@xmath120mpc@xmath110 , we expect between 1 and 4 sne  ia , given our survey volume and control time , which is consistent with us finding no sne in this small - volume bin . in the @xmath121 bin , our measurement appears to be inconsistent with the four highest - rate points of barris & tonry ( 2006 ) , and of dahlen et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) . however , we note that these rate measurements show a conspicuous enhancement , relative to most of the other results , at @xmath122 .",
    "we further note that the error bars on the barris & tonry ( 2006 ) dataset are poisson errors alone , and do not include any systematic uncertainties , such as classification errors that the sample may suffer from , at least to some extent . in the high - redshift bins , our rates are in good agreement with the dahlen et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) results .",
    "nevertheless , we find a @xmath1950% higher rate of sne  ia in the highest redshift bin .",
    "overall , the central values of our measurements suggest a sn  ia rate that is fairly constant with redshift at high redshift , and could be tracking the sfr .",
    "such a behavior is expected at high redshift if the rate then is dominated by a prompt sn  ia channel with a short delay time , and contrasts with the results of dahlen et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , whose data suggest a declining sn  ia rate beyond @xmath123 ( scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ) .     points .",
    "[ f : rate],scaledwidth=55.0% ]",
    "large samples of high-@xmath7 sne are required to resolve critical incompatibilities between recent results regarding the rates of sne  ia , and their delay time from star formation to explosion .",
    "here we have presented an initial sample of 33 sne from a new survey based on deep , single - epoch , re - imaging of the @xmath1 sdf .",
    "we have demonstrated that , for sn - rate purposes , such surveys can be carried out using ground - based observations , at a fraction of the cost of space - based data , and with the potential for large samples . using keck spectroscopy for more than half of the host galaxies , we have shown the reliability of photometric redshifts for such data , incidentally finding the sn with the highest host spectroscopic redshift reported to date , at @xmath124 .",
    "the sne were classified using a novel bayesian photometric algorithm , using solely the sn photometry in three bands , and the host - redshift information , either photometric or spectroscopic . the photometric classification of the sne introduces biases for which we correct using simulations .",
    "the debiasing procedure we apply to the raw sample reduces significantly the fraction of sne ia in the redshift bin @xmath121 , which otherwise would have been heavily contaminated by cc - sne .",
    "as discussed by neill et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , such contamination may have affected the sample acquired by barris & tonry ( 2006 ) , and could explain the discrepancy between their measurement of the sn  ia rate and the rates measured by pain et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and neill et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "our resulting sample is comparable to the goods sn sample , and is in good agreement with it , in terms of the total numbers of sne  ia and cc - sne , and in terms of the redshift distribution of the cc - sn sample .",
    "however , our sample of sne  ia shows less of a decline at high redshifts than the goods sample does .",
    "this trend remains when comparing the sn  ia rates we derive to those derived by goods .",
    "we find at redshift @xmath22 a rate which is similar to the values determined by pain et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , tonry et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and neill et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) at @xmath125 , but barely consistent with the results of barris & tonry ( 2006 ) and dahlen et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) . at @xmath21 ,",
    "our rate determination is consistent with the result of dahlen et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , but about 50% higher .    these results ,",
    "if confirmed by larger samples , may challenge current conclusions , based on the paucity of sne  ia found by goods at high redshift , concerning the sn  ia rate and the delay time .",
    "additional epochs on this field , already being obtained , will enlarge our sn sample to the hundreds , and will test the reality of the apparent decline in the sn  ia rate at @xmath8 .",
    "finally , our approaches to sn search and photometric classification are likely to become important in the era of synoptic telescopes such as pan - starrs ( kaiser et  al .",
