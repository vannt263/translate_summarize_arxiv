    "the cleo collaboration has recently discovered an unexpectedly large branching ratio for the semi - inclusive hadronic @xmath6 decay@xcite : @xmath7 the corresponding exclusive decay rate has also been measured : @xmath8 possible mechanisms behind this large production of fast @xmath1 meson have been discussed in recent papers@xcite .",
    "for example , atwood and soni(as)@xcite have suggested the subprocess @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 are virtual and real gluons , respectively ) as the main underlying mechanism . for this purpose ,",
    "the standard model qcd penguin is used in conjunction with gluon anomaly driven @xmath12 vertex . the form factor for this vertex @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the 4-momentum of the off - shell gluon @xmath10 , is approximated by the constant @xmath15 which in turn is extracted from @xmath16 decay .",
    "however , the approximation @xmath17 turns out to be problematic for two reasons : 1 ) as pointed out by hou and tseng@xcite , there is an implicit factor of @xmath18 in @xmath19 which should be running with @xmath20 and this would suppress as s estimate by a factor @xmath21 .",
    "2 ) on the other hand , kagan and petrov@xcite have indicated that the momentum dependence of the form factor could be quite significant with the leading behaviour of the form @xmath22 . as a result , including this effect further reduces as s result to about an order of magnitude below the observed branching ratio .",
    "cosequently , it has been suggested that the remedy could be in invoking new physics to increase @xmath23 to 10%-15% from its standard model value of nearly 0.2% .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility that a somewhat different process might be the underlying mechanism for @xmath6 .",
    "we propose a non - spectator process in which @xmath1 is produced via fusion of the gluon from qcd penguin @xmath24 and another one emitted by the light quark inside b meson ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it is shown that a conservative estimate of the contribution of this mechanism can naturally account for the observed value .",
    "we also calculate the branching ratios @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the context of factorization .",
    "the latter turns out to be smaller than the former by a factor 2 .",
    "the expression for figure 1 is the product of three terms : + 1 ) the effective neutral current flavor changing vertex @xmath2 which is as follows@xcite @xmath27\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath14 is the gluon four - momentum . in the process considered here , both chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic operators in ( 3 )",
    "however , since @xmath29 , the former operator is expected to have the dominant contribution .",
    "it is argued that the inclusion of the chromo - magnetic operator would increase the inclusive decay rate by 20% to 50%@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that even a conservative estimate of our proposed mechanism can account for the observed branching ratio in an order of magnitude sense .",
    "for this reason , in the rest of this work , we take into account only the dominant chromo - electric operator .",
    "+ 2 ) the gluon - gluon - psuedoscalar meson ( @xmath1 in this case ) vertex which can be written as : @xmath30 @xmath14 and @xmath31 are four - momenta of the two gluons and @xmath19 is the relevant form factor which contains a factor of @xmath18 implicitly . as made an estimate of @xmath32 gev@xmath33 using the decay mode @xmath34 which is expected to proceed mainly via on - shell gluons .",
    "however , contrary to @xmath35 assumption utilized by as , it is claimed that the momentum dependence of @xmath19 could be quite significant@xcite resulting in a suppression by an order of magnitude .",
    "we show that the non - spectator mechanism suggested in this work can produce a large enough branching ratio which could match the observed value when such suppression factor is taken into account .",
    "+ 3 ) the emission of gluon by the light quark .    by combining the above three terms",
    "one arrives at the effective hamiltonian corresponding to figure 1 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and the effective gluon mass @xmath38 regulates the singularity of the gluon propagator . a re - arrangement of ( 5 ) via fierz transformation : @xmath39\\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] simplifies the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "in fact , using the factorization assumption , only the first two terms in ( 7 ) contribute to @xmath40 . utilizing the definition of the b meson decay constant : @xmath41 and its associated relation : @xmath42 we obtain the relevant matrix element as follows : @xmath43\\epsilon^{\\mu\\sigma\\alpha\\beta } q_\\alpha p_\\beta\\;\\ ; .\\ ] ] hereafter , we take the light quark mass @xmath44 .",
    "the calculation of the differential decay rate is now straightforward , starting from the matrix element in eqn . (",
    "we use the usual convention for the invariant variables @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48\\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is the invariant mass of the final state strange hadron .",
    "the differential decay rate ( 11 ) depends on the virtualities of the internal gluons both explicitly and implicitly through the form factor @xmath19 .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , @xmath54 is suppressed for large values of @xmath55 and @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the dominant contribution to the decay rate is expected to arise from small virtuality region . on the other hand , in the non - spectator mechanism of figure 1 , due to kinematical freedom",
    ", one can impose a constraint such as @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , @xmath20 can be expressed as : @xmath57    integrating eqn . (",
    "11 ) over @xmath58 , we obtain the invariant mass distribution for the branching ratio , @xmath59 , depicted in figure 2 . for our numerical evaluations ,",
    "we have taken @xmath60 gev , @xmath61 is taken to be the constituent quark mass @xmath62 gev .",

    "is integrated over the range resulting in : @xmath67 the momentum dependence of @xmath68 has not been taken into account in the above estimate . however , even if one considers up to an order of magnitude suppression due to this form factor , our result indicates that the non - spectator mechanism is indeed the dominant process making up the bulk of the experimental data ( 1 ) .",
    "using eqn . ( 10 ) in conjunction with the factorization assumption , one can write the hadronic matrix element for @xmath69 as follows : @xmath71\\epsilon^{\\mu\\sigma\\alpha\\beta } q_\\alpha p_\\beta\\;\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fact , the second term in ( 14 ) does not contribute and the first term can be related to k - meson decay constant via the definition @xmath72 along with the identity @xmath73 as a result , the matrix element ( 14 ) can be simplified to : @xmath74 leading to the exclusive decay rate : @xmath75 which is derived by imposing the @xmath56 constraint . @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the three momentum of the k meson and the energy change of the light quark in b meson rest frame , respectively : @xmath78}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\;\\ ; , \\\\ p_0&=&\\frac{m_b^2-m_b^2}{2m_b}-e_q\\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the energy of the light quark in k meson . to proceed with the numerical evaluation of @xmath25 , one can assume an appropriate model to estimate @xmath79 .",
    "however , roughly speaking , one would expect @xmath80 gev .",
    "the exclusive branching ratio is then estimated to be @xmath81 which is in good agreement with experimental data ( 2 ) .    in the same manner",

    "( 12 ) by substituting @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath58 , respectively . in order to estimate the branching ratio for @xmath92 , in analogy with @xmath69 exclusive decay , we take the energy of the light quark in @xmath4 to be : @xmath93 which results in gev@xmath94 by using the experimental value of the ratio @xmath95 and @xmath96 gev @xcite . ] : @xmath97 we note that the results for exclusive decays should not be altered significantly due to momentum dependence of @xmath19 .",
