    "we study the density of the roots of @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a random @xmath1 unitary matrix , with respect to the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) of random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "our main motivation is to investigate the horizontal distribution of the zeros of the derivative of the riemann zeta function .",
    "the zeta function is defined by @xmath11 and has an analytic continuation in the rest of the complex plane except for a simple pole at @xmath12 .",
    "there are infinitely many _",
    "non - trivial _ solutions to the equation @xmath13 in the strip @xmath14 ; the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) states that they all lie on the _ critical line _ @xmath15 .",
    "the interest in the horizontal distribution of the zeros of @xmath3 is motivated by its connection with rh . in 1934 speiser",
    "@xcite showed that rh is equivalent to @xmath3 having no zeros in the region @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , up to now the most efficient ways of computing the fraction the of zeros of the riemann zeta function on the the critical line are based on what is known as _",
    "levinson s method _",
    "@xcite ; it turns out that the zeros of @xmath3 close to the critical line have a significant effect on the efficiency of this technique  @xcite , therefore it is important to know how they are distributed .",
    "levinson and montgomery  @xcite proved a quantitative refinement of speiser s theorem , namely that @xmath2 and @xmath3 have essentially the same number of zeros to the left of @xmath17 , and showed that as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the height on the critical line , a positive proportion of the zeros of @xmath3 are in the region @xmath20 subsequent improvements of levinson and montgomery s results , first by conrey and ghosh  @xcite , then by guo  @xcite , soundararajan  @xcite and recently by zhang  @xcite have established that a typical zero of @xmath3 tends to be much closer to the critical line and that conditionally on rh a positive proportion lie in the region @xmath21 for some positive constant @xmath22 .",
    "their distribution , however , is still unknown .",
    "other results on the zeros of @xmath3 can be found in  @xcite .    over the past thirty years",
    ", overwhelming evidence has been accumulated which suggests that the local correlations of the non - trivial zeros of @xmath2 coincide , as @xmath23 , with those of the eigenvalues of hermitian matrices of large dimensions from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue )  @xcite . as @xmath4 ,",
    "the gue statistics are in turn the same as those of the phases of the eigenvalues of @xmath1 unitary matrices , on the scale of their mean distance @xmath24 , averaged over the cue ensemble .",
    "more recently , however , it was realized that rmt not only describes with high accuracy the distribution of the riemann zeros , but that it also provides techniques to make predictions and computations about the riemann zeta function and certain classes of _ l_-functions that previous methods had not been able to tackle .",
    "this started with the work of keating and snaith  @xcite on moments of the riemann zeta function and other _ l_-functions .",
    "their key observation was that the locally determined statistical properties of @xmath2 high up the critical line can be modelled by characteristic polynomials @xmath0 of random unitary matrices @xmath10 . in this model the two asymptotic parameters , @xmath19 for @xmath2 and @xmath25 for @xmath10 ,",
    "are compared by setting the densities of the zeros of @xmath2 and of the eigenvalues of @xmath10 equal , i.e. @xmath26 this approach has since been extremely successful  @xcite .    following the same ideas , in this paper we suggest that the density @xmath27 of the roots of @xmath5 will accurately describe the distribution of the zeros of @xmath3 .",
    "a classical theorem in complex analysis states that if @xmath28 is a polynomial , then the roots of @xmath29 that are not roots of @xmath28 lie all in the interior or on the boundary of the smallest convex polygon containing the zeros of @xmath28 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , since the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix have modulus one , the solutions of the equation @xmath30 that are not zeros of @xmath0 are all inside the unit circle .",
    "if @xmath31 , @xmath32 , denotes the point at which @xmath3 is evaluated , then the region of @xmath33 to the right of the critical line is mapped inside the unit circle by the conformal mapping @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the radial density @xmath35 becomes the analogue of the horizontal distribution of the zeros of @xmath3 to the right of the line @xmath15 .",
    "however , instead of @xmath27 , it turns out to be more convenient to consider @xmath36 , the fraction of the roots in the annulus @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the _ scaled distance _ from the unit circle .",
    "our main results concern the asymptotics of @xmath36 .",
    "we show that as @xmath25 increases the roots of @xmath5 approach the unit circle , and @xmath36 tends to a function independent of @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the following asymptotics as @xmath4 : @xmath39 these formulae are then tested numerically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ zup ] we introduce the mathematical problem and describe the main properties of the roots of @xmath5 ; in section  [ asrho ] the asymptotics of @xmath36 as @xmath7 are computed ; using heurstic arguments , in section  [ smxas ] , @xmath36 is derived in the limit @xmath8 ; section  [ concl ] concludes the paper with final remarks .",
    "the cue ensemble of rmt is defined as the space @xmath40 of @xmath41 unitary matrices endowed with a probability measure @xmath42 invariant under any inner automorphism @xmath43 in other words , @xmath42 must be invariant under left and right multiplication by elements of @xmath40 , so that each matrix in the ensemble is equally weighted .",
    "there exists a unique measure on the unitary group @xmath40 with this property , known as _",
    "haar measure_. the infinitesimal volume element of the cue ensemble occupied by those matrices whose eigenvalues have phases lying between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 our goal in this paper is to study the density of the roots of @xmath5 , where @xmath10 is a random unitary matrix with distribution given by  .",
    "the analogous problem for the ginibre ensemble has been studied by dennis and hannay  @xcite .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "are plotted the zeros of the characteristic polynomials @xmath0 and of their derivatives of two unitary matrices taken at random with respect to haar measure for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "such matrices can be easily generated numerically by taking complex matrices whose entries are independent complex random numbers with gaussian distribution , and then by applying gram - schmidt orthogonalization to the rows or columns ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "there are a few qualitative features that can be immediately observed .",
    "firstly , since the distribution   is translation invariant on the unit circle , the density of the roots of @xmath5 depends only on the distance from the origin .",
    "secondly , as mentioned in the introduction , the roots of @xmath5 are all inside the unit circle .",
    "this property can be easily understood with the following argument .",
    "let @xmath50 be @xmath25 complex numbers ; if they all are on the same side of a straight line passing through the origin , then @xmath51 let @xmath52 be the roots of a polynomial @xmath28 and @xmath53 a point outside the smallest convex polygon containing @xmath52 . now , consider a straight line passing through @xmath53 and lying outside such a polygon .",
    "because of equation  , the logarithmic derivative @xmath54 can not vanish .",
    "there are two others less obvious features that figure  [ fig1 ] reveals and that become more apparent as @xmath25 increases : firstly , the roots of @xmath5 concentrate in a small region in proximity of the the unit circle ; secondly , given two consecutive zeros of @xmath0 , say @xmath55 and @xmath56 , close to each other , there often appears to be a root of @xmath5 near the midpoint @xmath57 in the following sections we shall give quantitative interpretations of these properties .",
    "let us set @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; furthermore , denote by @xmath60 the set of roots of @xmath5 and consider the linear functional @xmath61_{\\lambda_j(\\btheta ) } = \\int_{\\mathbb{c } } \\tau(z ) \\bdelta\\left(z - \\lambda_j(\\btheta)\\right ) \\rmd^2 z = \\tau\\left(\\lambda_j(\\btheta)\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is an infinitely differentiable complex function whose partial derivatives with respect to @xmath64 and @xmath65 decrease faster than any power of @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , @xmath67 is the product of two dirac delta functions with real arguments .",
    "then , we have @xmath68^n } \\int_{\\mathbb{c}}\\tau(z)\\ , \\bdelta\\left(z - \\lambda_j(\\btheta)\\right ) \\delta^2(\\btheta ) \\rmd^2 z \\ , \\rmd^n \\btheta,\\ ] ] where the distribution @xmath69^n}\\bdelta\\left(z - \\lambda_j(\\btheta)\\right)\\delta^2(\\btheta ) \\rmd^n \\btheta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] defines the density of @xmath70 .",
    "the main tool that we shall use to evaluate   is a basic identity that expresses _ toeplitz determinants _ in terms of integrals over the unitary group .",

    "furthermore , we have @xmath101 hence , the first series in   converges too , and the strong szeg limit theorem applies .    when computing derivatives of the asymptotics of the integral  , care must be taken that the error term does not become comparable or even greater than the leading - order term .",

    "such computation seems to be an extremely difficult task : the integrand has essential singularities that usual techniques in rmt and complex analysis can not tackle .",
    "notwithstanding such obstacles , it turns out that @xmath36 can be derived in the limit @xmath8 with the help of a heuristic argument .",
    "as was mentioned in section  [ zup ] , from figure  [ fig1 ] it appears that if @xmath55 and @xmath115 are two consecutive roots of @xmath0 which are close to each other , then as @xmath4 there is often a root of @xmath5 near the midpoint  .",
    "thus , one might be led to assume that for small @xmath38 the distance from the origin @xmath107 is distributed like @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the rescaled distance , or spacing , between phases of consecutive eigenvalues , i.e. @xmath118 this is trivially true only for @xmath119 ; since @xmath120 , for @xmath121 equation   would imply an average distance of the zeros of @xmath5 from the unit circle of order @xmath122 , and therefore a dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath25 even at the leading order , which contradicts the numerics reported in figure  [ fig2 ] and formula  .",
    "it turns out that behaviour of @xmath36 as @xmath8 can be understood using dyson s electrostatic model for the cue ensemble ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the zeros of @xmath0 can be interpreted as @xmath25 unit charges confined in a two - dimensional universe and moving in a thin circular conducting wire of radius one .",
    "the electric field generated at any point in the complex plane by this coulomb gas is just the complex conjugate of the logarithmic derivative of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath123 hence , the zeros of @xmath5 are located where @xmath124 vanishes .",
    "now , the field at point @xmath125 , whose distance from the unit circle is of order @xmath126 , can be separated into two components : the first one is the field of the two charges closest to @xmath125 , let us denote them by a and b , whose strength is clearly of order @xmath25 ; the second one is the field generated by the other @xmath127 charges . as @xmath25 increases , @xmath125 approaches the unit circle , and the latter component of @xmath128 can be approximated by the field of a continuous circular charge distribution with density @xmath129 , i.e. @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the field generated by @xmath132 and @xmath133 the one determined by a and b. for large @xmath25 , @xmath131 and @xmath133 have approximately opposite directions , thus @xmath124 might vanish at @xmath125 only if @xmath134 .",
    "this situation is described schematically in figure  [ elecm ] .     and",
    "@xmath133 of the electric field   at a point @xmath125 close to the unit circle in dyson s electrostatic model.,width=288 ]    determining the order of magnitude of @xmath131 is a simple exercise in electrostatics .",
    "if the continuous charge distribution filled the whole unit circle , the field inside it would be zero .",
    "thus , by linearity @xmath131 is equal and opposite to the field of a circular arc @xmath135 $ ] with charge density @xmath132 and containing no more than four eigenvalues .",
    "we have @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the distance between @xmath125 and @xmath138 . by setting @xmath139 , with @xmath140 , and applying the mean value theorem",
    "we obtain @xmath141 since the length of the interval @xmath142 $ ] is of the order of few level spacings , @xmath143 and @xmath134 .",
    "the field @xmath144 vanishes at the midpoint  , but for large @xmath25 the presence of @xmath145 shifts the zeros of @xmath124 at a distance of order @xmath126 from the unit circle .",
    "since at first approximation the contribution of @xmath145 does not depend on the spacing @xmath117 , from   it is reasonable to assume that as @xmath8 the distance of the zeros of @xmath5 from the unit circle is approximately distributed like @xmath146 .",
    "hence , we shall conjecture that @xmath147 where @xmath148 is a constant independent of @xmath25 .    from equation",
    "it is straightforward to derive an asymptotics expression for @xmath36 as @xmath8 .",
    "we have @xmath149 where @xmath150\\ ] ] and @xmath151 is the cue spacing distribution in the limit @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath152 @xmath151 has a power series expansion with infinite radius of convergence : @xmath153    there exist efficient algorithms for computing the coefficients @xmath154 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which with symbolic mathematical packages can be evaluated exactly up to very high values of @xmath155 . using   one can easily obtain a series expansion for @xmath36 : @xmath156 now we have to determine the parameter @xmath148 , which can be found only empirically .",
    "it turns out that if we set @xmath157 there exists an astonishing agreement between   and numerics in the region where the large @xmath38 asymptotics is not valid .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "notwithstanding the accuracy with which the series   models the numerical data , it can be expected to approximate @xmath36 only for small @xmath38 ; indeed , it tends to one much faster than @xmath158 .",
    "furthermore , in deriving   we have implicitly assumed that the main contribution to @xmath36 comes only from the two zeros of @xmath0 closest to a given root of @xmath5 ; we now need to estimate in what region this assumption is justified .",
    "let us consider @xmath159 successive eigenvalues of a unitary matrix .",
    "since haar measure is translation invariant on the unit circle , the corrections to   will depend by all possible rescaled distances @xmath160 however , as @xmath161 , the limit densities @xmath162 go to zero very fast , hence the dependence on @xmath163 does not affect the first few terms of the series  .",
    "for example , consider three consecutive zeros of @xmath0 close to each other , say @xmath164 simple algebra and dyson s model indicate that the rescaled distance @xmath38 should be distributed like @xmath165 for some constant @xmath166 independent of @xmath25 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath167 which suggests that the contributions to   due to @xmath168 leave the coefficients of the terms @xmath169 with @xmath170 unchanged . for @xmath171",
    ", @xmath172 goes to zero as @xmath173 even faster than  .",
    "these considerations and formula   give the following expression for the asymptotic expansion of @xmath36 : @xmath174    however , from the agreement with numerics observed in figure  [ fig4 ] and  [ bcurves ] , we would expect that the corrections to the series   should be negligible up to terms of order much higher than @xmath175 .    the integrated distribution @xmath36 is plotted in figure  [ mnum ] for zeros of @xmath5 computed numerically for random unitary matrices of various dimensions ; clearly , @xmath36 tends to a limit function .",
    "figure  [ bcurves ] shows that equation   and the series   together , although asymptotic formulae , approximate @xmath36 with high accuracy for all @xmath176 .",
    "we have investigated the density @xmath27 of the roots of @xmath5 , where @xmath0 is the characteristic polynomial of a random @xmath1 unitary matrix with distribution given by haar measure on the unitary group .",
    "since the locally determined statistical properties of the riemann zeta function high up the critical line can be modelled by @xmath0 , it is expected that @xmath27 will accurately describe the behaviour of the zeros of @xmath3 .",

    "it is shown that as @xmath180 , @xmath36 becomes independent of @xmath25 .",
    "the density @xmath27 can be defined as the average over @xmath40 of the sum of delta functions @xmath181 where the @xmath182 are the zeros of @xmath5 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath36 for large @xmath38 can be computed by applying standard techniques for integrals over @xmath40 .",
    "the sum of dirac deltas can be manipulated in such a way that eventually the average over @xmath40 is reduced to the computation of the second derivative of an integral over the complex plane of the sum of two toeplitz determinants .",
    "furthermore , the integrand satisfies the hypothesis of the strong szeg limit theorem , which gives a simple asympotic expression for such determinants .",
    "further simple manipulations lead to @xmath183    the limits @xmath8 and @xmath4 do not commute ; the evaluation of the asymptotics of @xmath36 as @xmath184 requires first the computation of the limit @xmath184 and then of the limit @xmath180 .",
    "the application of szeg s theorem clearly prevents this , therefore provides information only for relative large @xmath38 .",
    "however , dyson s electrostatic model for the cue ensemble leads naturally to the assumptions that for small @xmath38 , as @xmath185 , the distance of the roots of @xmath5 from the unit circle is on average of order @xmath126 and is distributed like the square of the spacings between phases of consecutive eigenvalues of unitary matrices in the cue ensemble ( appropriately rescaled ) .",
    "these two simple hypotheses give a conjecture for @xmath36 as @xmath184 whose agreement with numerical experiments covers with high accuracy the region where the large @xmath38 asymptotics fails .",
    "unfortunately , the zeros of @xmath3 are poorly understood , and there is not even a conjecture for their horizontal distribution to compare with the results derived in this paper .",
    "given that it seems extremely difficult to obtain an analytical expression of such a quantity , we believe that it would be interesting and worthwhile to conduct a thorough numerical study as independent verification of the model presented here .",
