    "x - ray observations are often used to infer various properties of energetic electrons accelerated during the solar flares . the spatially integrated x - ray photon spectrum @xmath1 ( photons  @xmath2  s@xmath3  kev@xmath3 )",
    "is related to mean electron flux spectrum @xmath4 ( electrons @xmath2  s@xmath3  kev@xmath3 ) via the rather simple linear integral relation @xcite @xmath5 for source volume @xmath6 , mean plasma density @xmath7 , and isotropic bremsstrahlung cross - section per unit photon energy @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "although the angular distribution of energetic electrons is generally unknown , the recent observations @xcite suggest rather close to isotropic distribution of electrons .",
    "the exact plasma density distribution and flaring volume are also poorly known and therefore value @xmath10 is normally inferred .",
    "the value @xmath11 is model independent @xcite , and the detailed energy structure of this is related to electron acceleration and propagation physics .",
    "radio emission spectrum of solar energetic particles , although normally only at above a few hundred kev energies , is an alternative approach to infer electron beam and plasma parameters @xcite .",
    "the spatially integrated spectrum of energetic electrons @xmath11 is often _ approximated _ as a sum of a isothermal maxwellian distribution and a non - thermal power - law distribution @xcite .",
    "the thermal component often dominates the overall spectrum at low energies @xmath12  kev and little can be said about the low - energy part of non - thermal distribution .",
    "however , the low - energy part of non - thermal spectra plays a crucial role in the solar flare diagnostics .",
    "most of the non - thermal electron energy is concentrated in this part , hence this defines the total energy budget of the flare .",
    "in addition , this part of the spectrum is more effectively influenced by various electron propagation effects like collisions @xcite or beam - plasma interactions @xcite , thus playing an important role in the electron transport diagnostics in the solar flares .",
    "various model - based methods to find the value of low energy cutoff have been used .",
    "requiring that the assumed thermal emission dominate over non - thermal emissions find a low energy cutoff of @xmath13 kev should be present .",
    "assuming `` theoretical neupert effect '' to be satisfied conclude that the low energy cutoff should be between @xmath14 kev and @xmath15 kev for four flares analysed in the paper .",
    "have used empirical relationship between the observed parameters of the photon power - law fit and the low - energy cutoff of the electron distribution and have found that the low - energy cutoffs in microflare events could range from @xmath16 to @xmath17  kev with the median being around @xmath18  kev . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the _ model - independent _ inference of low - energy cutoffs in the mean electron spectra .",
    "high resolution spectra observed by rhessi @xcite allows us to infer detailed structure of electron distribution often never seen before .",
    "have demonstrated that the mean electron spectrum @xmath10 has a statistically significant local minimum at approximately @xmath19 kev in the electron spectrum of goes x - class july 23 , 2002 solar flare , although this feature is likely to be an instrumental effect caused by a pulse pile - up .",
    "show that some electron spectra inferred from rhessi x - ray spectra free from pile - up issues seem inconsistent with a simple collisional thick - target model @xcite .",
    "however , the photon spectra of these events should be corrected for albedo - compton back - scattered x - rays @xcite .",
    "have shown that the spectrum of the august 20 , 2002 event with a puzzlingly large value of the low - energy cutoff @xmath20 kev can be understood in terms of the photospheric albedo .",
    "flares showing a weak thermal component allow us to scrutinize the low - energy part of the non - thermal distribution of electrons .",
    "the analysis can be done either by _ assuming _ a functional form of the electron spectrum @xcite or by using the regularised inversion techniques @xcite .",
    "it is known that flat x - ray spectra ( low value of photon spectral index ) can require low - energy cutoffs in the power - law distributions when a functional form is assumed @xcite , whereas the model independent approach , via the regularised inversion technique , @xcite may show a dip or a gap in the electron distribution @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the results of a systematic search for dips in the mean electron flux distribution using the rhessi solar flare database for the period of feb 2002 - may 2006 .",
    "section  [ analysis ] describes the selection criteria for the flare photon spectra and the application of the regularised inversion method for the determination of the corresponding mean electron flux spectra .",
    "section  [ dips ] discusses energies and depths of the obtained statistically significant dips and their relation to the photospheric albedo .",
    "the analysis confirms previous suggestions that the isotropic albedo correction is capable of removing all statistically significant dips in the mean electron flux distribution .",
    "the obtained results are summarised in section  [ summary ] .",
    "as a basis , we used the list of 398 flares with weak thermal component previously determined by .",
    "although this has limited the total number events for our analysis , it has helped us to avoid various effects , such as pulse pile - up and particle contamination , complicating the spectral analysis @xcite .",
    "next , we chose the 177 events with the smallest values of spectral index @xmath21 , where @xmath22 was measured in the range between 15 and 20 kev - see .",
    "for each flare , the spectra were accumulated over the duration of the impulsive phase , i.e. in the interval when counts at energies above 50 kev were above background ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the spectra were generated in the energy range from 3 to 100 kev with 1 kev resolution avoiding detectors 2 and 7 due to their low resolution @xcite .",
    "the background counts were removed in a standard way @xcite .    to obtain a starting point for the regularised inversion ,",
    "spectra were forward fitted assuming an isothermal plus a non - thermal double power - law distribution of @xmath23 , for example .",
    "spectra were then inverted within ospex using the regularised inversion routines @xcite minimizing the functional @xcite    @xmath24    where @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a spectral response matrix of rhessi converting photons to photon counts , @xmath28 is a matrix representation of our linear integral ( [ idef ] ) , @xmath29 is the matrix representation of the additional constraint , @xmath30 is data vector of background - subtracted count spectrum ( counts  @xmath2  s@xmath3  kev@xmath3 ) , and @xmath31 is the vector of unknown density - weighted mean electron spectrum @xmath32 .",
    "the equation [ mproblem ] can be solved analytically using generalised singular value decomposition .",
    "regularisation parameter , @xmath33 , is determined from the analysis of normalized residuals , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are the uncertainties of the count spectrum .",
    "then the deviation weighted by the error @xmath36 accounts quite accurately for point - to - point error variation .",
    "indeed @xmath37 defined by equation ( [ chi2 ] ) has accounted for detailed structure of errors .",
    "parameter @xmath38 is chosen to make the residuals @xmath39 to be close to gaussian @xcite .    using first order regularisation , i.e. operator @xmath29 being a finite difference representation of a derivative operator",
    ", we found mean electron flux spectrum @xmath10 for all 177 flares with spectral index @xmath40 less than 4 .",
    "with the mean electron flux determined , the spectrum was examined for local minima or so - called dips .",
    "these dips were analyzed to infer the dip ( local minimum ) parameters : the energy @xmath41 at which the dip minima occurs and the depth of the dip @xmath42 in terms of @xmath43 , where @xmath43 is the statistical uncertainty on the inferred mean electron spectrum @xmath10 .",
    "this depth was calculated by dividing the difference between the minimum and the maximum above the dip in units of electron spectra uncertainty at the minimum ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we have found 18 events with a dip depth deeper than 1 @xmath43 in the electron distribution function .",
    "the details of these events are presented in table 1 .",
    "some of the events presented in the table 1 have been found using thick - target model fit with a single power - law and low energy cutoff @xcite .",
    "the local minima in the mean electron spectra are 6 - 10 kev wide and hence cover a few statistically independent energy points .",
    "for example , if a dip is three points wide at @xmath44 level in each point , the probability to find three consecutive points outside @xmath44 interval is @xmath45 and the corresponding statistical significance of the minimum is @xmath46 . in general , given that the errors have normal distribution the statistical significance of the local minimum is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the total number of statistically independent points in a dip ( local minimum ) and @xmath49 is the depth of each point in units of the corresponding @xmath50 uncertainties .",
    "the sizes of statistically independent energy bins can be estimated from horizontal errors ( figure 2 ) .",
    "thus , the local minimum ( dip ) shown in figure 2 has statistical significance @xmath51[1-\\mbox{erf}(1.2/\\sqrt(2))]\\approx 99.9\\%$ ] .",
    ".events with a local minimum ( dip ) in the mean electron spectrum dipper than 1@xmath43 ; @xmath52 is the depth of a dip in @xmath43 ; @xmath53 is the energy of the local minimum ; @xmath54 is the cosine of flare heliocentric angle ; @xmath40 is the photon spectral index measured in the range @xmath55 - @xmath56 kev , with typical uncertainty @xmath57 .

    "the observed electron spectrum ( solid line ) and electron spectrum after isotropic albedo correction ( dashed line ) are given with @xmath44 error bars .",

    "the dip energies @xmath53 are given in table 1 as the bin centre energy .",
    "there is no preferential energy in this range ( figure 3 - right panel . )",
    "there is a clear pattern in the results : flares with dips tend to occur at locations with large @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the flare heliocentric angle .",
    "only 4 events are located close to the solar limb @xmath60 while 14 are near the disk centre @xmath60 - see left panel in figure 3 .",
    "there is also no strong evidence for the dip energy being dependent on the flare location or on the dip depth - see left and right panel in figure  4 , respectively .",
    "previous works @xcite have shown that a feature such as a dip can be a signature of distortion by albedo contribution .",
    "figure 5 ( right panel ) shows that larger dips appear for flatter x - ray spectra .",
    "furthermore , events with large depths tend to appear close to the disc centre , see figure  4 .",
    "this is consistent with the albedo model @xcite which predicts larger albedo contribution for flat spectra and disc centre events .",
    "it is noteworthy that the albedo contribution to the observed photon spectrum is still noticeable even for the flares at heliocentric angles larger than @xmath61 .",
    "the albedo - corrected mean electron spectra for flares at @xmath62 show no dips larger than @xmath63 .",
    "the isotropic albedo correction @xcite was applied to all the events with a dip in table 1 and new @xmath10 , i.e. corresponding to the primary photon spectra , were derived .",
    "such albedo corrected mean electron spectra does not reveal any significant dip , i.e. with depth @xmath64 .",
    "our analysis shows that the clear dips are rare , only 18 of 177 events demonstrate a clear dip .",
    "the small number of events with a clear dip or low energy cutoff can be explained by a variety of reasons .",
    "firstly , it suggests that the number of very flat primary spectra is rather small and that the vast majority of flares have primary spectral index larger than 2 .",
    "indeed , although the total number of events with a dip is small ( left panel in figure 5 ) the fraction of events could be as high as 60% for small spectral indices",
    "( right panel in figure 5 ) . this can be viewed as a lower limit on spectral indices of accelerated electrons in solar flares . in the case of a thick - target model",
    ", the spectral index of accelerated electrons should be larger than 3 .",
    "secondly , the small number of events with a dip or low energy cutoff suggests that the thermal component substantially influences the spectrum in the range of above 10 kev for the majority of flares .",
    "this conclusion is partially supported by , who have found a large number of events with very soft spectra with spectral indices @xmath40 which are larger than 5",
    ".    however , when dips occur in the mean electron spectrum , the local minima in the electron flux spectrum is consistent with albedo model @xcite . in the standard solar flare model ,",
    "the electrons are believed to propagate downwards and hence the reflected flux from the photosphere should be larger . in this work",
    "the albedo was assumed to be isotropic and this can be viewed as a lower limit on albedo contribution . therefore the explanation that albedo might be overestimated seems unlikely .",
    "as can be seen in figure 5 flares with a low value of @xmath22 are very likely to exhibit a local minimum in the mean electron flux spectrum , therefore the small number of flares with flat spectra results in the the low number of flares with dips .",
    "in addition , the energies of the dip minima are concentrated near 15 kev , the energy which is expected from isotropic albedo model ( see figure 1 in ) .",
    "we also note that earlier observation of flat x - ray spectrum are consistent with the albedo model .",
    "the flares suggesting high value of low energy observed by , had flat x - ray spectra and were disk centre events confirming conclusions of this work .",
    "the low - energy cutoff is often introduced to limit the total number of non - thermal electrons in solar flares .",
    "since all dips found in the electron spectra can be easily `` removed '' by applying albedo correction , our results allow to conclude that if low - energy cutoff exists in solar flare spectra it should be below @xmath65 kev .",
    "this value puts an upper limit on the low energy cutoffs and is somewhat less than the values published in the literature .",
    "in addition , since the total number of electrons accelerated in solar flares is dependent on the low - energy cutoff the lower value of low - energy cutoff makes the electron number problem even more severe .",
