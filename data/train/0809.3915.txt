    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies  from the early days of the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite until the most recent observations of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap)have consistently indicated a low value of the quadrupole , below the cosmic variance of the concordant @xmath3cdm cosmological model with a nearly scale invariant , primordial spectrum  @xcite . while there has been a recurring debate about the statistical significance of the quadrupole and the other outliers ( notably , near the multipole moments @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) in the cmb angular power spectrum ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , there has also been constant activity to understand possible underlying physical reasons for the outliers ( see , for an inexhaustive list , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    given the cmb observations ,",
    "different model independent approaches have been used to recover the primordial spectrum ( see , for example , refs .",
    "while all these approaches arrive at a spectrum that is nearly scale invariant at the smaller scales , most of them inevitably seem to point to a sharp drop in power at the scales corresponding to the hubble scale today . within the inflationary scenario , a variety of single and two field models",
    "have been constructed to produce such a drop in power at the large scales  @xcite . however , in single field inflationary models , in order to produce such a spectrum , we find that many of the scenarios either assume a specific pre - inflationary regime , say , a radiation dominated epoch , or special initial conditions for the background scalar field , such as an initial period of fast roll  @xcite .",
    "moreover , some of them impose the initial conditions on the perturbations when the largest scales are outside the hubble radius during the pre - inflationary or the fast roll regime  @xcite .",
    "such requirements are rather artificial and , ideally , it would be preferable to produce the desired power spectrum during an inflationary epoch without invoking any specific pre - inflationary phase or special initial conditions for the inflaton . furthermore , though a very specific pre - inflationary phase such as the radiation dominated epoch may allow what can be considered as natural ( i.e. minkowski - like ) initial conditions for the perturbations even at super - hubble scales , we believe that choosing to impose initial conditions for a small subset of modes when they are outside the hubble radius , while demanding that such conditions be imposed on the rest of the modes at sub - hubble scales , can be considered unsatisfactory .",
    "it has long been known that power spectra with large deviations from scale invariance can be generated in inflationary models that admit one or more periods of departure from the slow roll phase ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "the degree of the deviation from a nearly scale invariant spectrum would be determined by the extent and duration of the departure , which are , in turn , controlled by the parameters of the model .",
    "a departure from slow roll affects the evolution of modes that leave the hubble radius just before the departure . rather than remaining constant ,",
    "the curvature perturbations , say , @xmath6 , corresponding to these modes evolve at super - hubble scales , sourced by the intrinsic entropy perturbations of the inflaton field which , typically , exhibit a rapid growth during the fast roll regime  @xcite .",
    "such an evolution on super - hubble scales results in dips or bursts of oscillations in the scalar power spectrum .",
    "usually , such a departure is induced by introducing a sharp feature in the potential of the inflaton field , such as a step or a sudden change in the slope  @xcite . however , this is not necessary , and transitions to fast roll for brief periods can be generated even with smooth and better motivated effective potentials  @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to present a simple model of inflation that supresses the power spectrum on large scales , a feature  as we discussed above  that seems to be necessary to fit the lower power in the quadrupole ( and , to some extent , in the deviant power at other lower multipoles such as the octopole and the multipole @xmath7 ) of the cmb angular power spectrum , using an effective potential of the canonical scalar field _ without _ introducing any ad hoc sharp feature .",
    "we find that the form of the potentials motivated by a class of certain minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model provide us with the desired behavior  @xcite .",
    "these large field models allow a period of fast roll sandwiched between two stages of slow roll inflation .",
    "the first phase of slow roll inflation allows us to impose the standard bunch - davies initial conditions on the modes which exit the hubble radius during the subsequent fast roll regime , an epoch due to which the curvature perturbations on the super - hubble scales are suppressed .",
    "the second slow roll phase lasts for about @xmath8-@xmath9 @xmath10-folds , thereby allowing us to overcome the standard horizon problem associated with the hot big bang model .",
    "the advantages of our approach over other single field models mentioned earlier are twofold .",
    "firstly , we do not need to assume any specific pre - inflationary phase .",
    "the entire evolution of the inflationary era is described by a single inflaton potential and , therefore , is much simpler .",
    "secondly , the modes which exit the hubble radius during the fast roll regime are inside the hubble radius during the first stage of slow roll inflation and , hence , we do not have to impose any special initial conditions on the large scale modes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bd ] , we shall review the essential features of the effective inflaton potential that we shall consider , and describe the background dynamics in situations of our interest . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ps ] , after an outline of the slow roll ` expectations ' of the scalar spectrum that can arise in such a background , we shall discuss the spectra that we obtain through numerical integration . in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] , using the cosmological boltzmann code camb and the monte carlo code cosmomc , we shall compare the power spectra from the models we consider with the recent wmap 5-year data .",
    "finally , we shall close with sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , wherein after a brief summary of our results , we shall discuss as to how the results from our model compare with those that have been obtained in another closely related single field model .    in the discussions below",
    ", we shall set @xmath11 and @xmath12 as well as @xmath13 to unity .",
    "also , throughout , an overdot and an overprime shall denote differentiation with respect to the cosmic and the conformal times , respectively .",
    "the effective potential for the inflation field that we shall consider is described by two parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and is given by v ( ) = ()^2 -  ( ) ^n + ()^2(n-1 ) , [ eq : mssm - p ] where @xmath16 is an integer .",
    "such potentials are known to arise in certain minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model  @xcite , and their role as an inflaton and its related effects have been studied recently  @xcite .",
    "( we should also hasten to add that the specific case of @xmath17 has been considered much earlier for reasons similar to ours , viz .",
    "producing certain features in the primordial spectrum  @xcite . ) in the above potential , the coefficient of the @xmath18 term has been chosen in such a way that the potential has a point of inflection at @xmath19 ( i.e. the location where both @xmath20 and @xmath21 vanish ) , with @xmath22 given by _ 0 = ^. near this point of inflection , the potential exhibits a plateau with an extremely small curvature , which , as we shall discuss below , proves to be crucial for the desired evolution of the inflaton field .",
    "the potential  ( [ eq : mssm - p ] ) for the case @xmath17 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssm - p ] .",
    "-112 true pt -260 true pt @xmath23 100 true pt 15 true pt @xmath24 2 true pt    note that the potential  ( [ eq : mssm - p ] ) roughly behaves as @xmath25 recall that , the first potential slow roll parameter is given by  @xcite _ 1 =  ( ) ()^2 , and inflation ends as @xmath26 crosses unity .",
    "it is then clear that , in a power law potential of the form @xmath27 , slow roll inflation will occur ( i.e. @xmath28 ) when @xmath29 , and inflation will end when @xmath30 \\sim \\mathcal{o}(1)$ ] .",
    "thus , for a transition from slow roll to fast roll to occur , we need to choose the two parameters in the potential  ( [ eq : mssm - p ] ) so that @xmath31 , i.e. of the order of the ( reduced ) planck scale . restarting inflation after the fast roll phase and the number of @xmath10-folds that can be achieved during the second phase of slow roll crucially depends on the value of @xmath32 .",
    "we rely on the numerics to choose this parameter carefully since the above slow roll estimate only provides a rough order of magnitude .",
    "choosing @xmath32 in such a way is actually fine tuning , but it seems to be inevitable if we are to achieve the desired slow - fast - slow roll transition as well as the required number of @xmath10-folds .",
    "once the point of inflection has been identified , we find that the normalization to the cmb angular power spectrum data provides the second constraint , thereby determining the value of the other free parameter  @xmath14 .",
    "the equation of motion governing the scalar field described by the potential  ( [ eq : mssm - p ] ) , when expressed as two first order equations for the coupled variables @xmath24 and @xmath33 , has one attractive fixed point located at the origin , i.e. at @xmath34 . for positive values of  @xmath24",
    ", we find that there exists an attractor trajectory towards which all other trajectories with arbitrary initial conditions on @xmath24 and @xmath33 quickly converge .",
    "for a suitably chosen @xmath32 , we find that the attractor trajectory exhibits two regimes of slow roll inflation sandwiching a period of fast roll . hence",
    ", if we start the evolution with @xmath35 , then the initial values of @xmath24 and @xmath36 prove to be irrelevant for the subsequent dynamics as they approach the attractor .",
    "this behavior is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] where we have plotted the phase portrait for the @xmath37 case .",
    "-118 true pt -220 true pt @xmath33 107 true pt 75 true pt @xmath24 2 true pt    once the field reaches close to @xmath32 , due to the extreme flatness of the potential  ( [ eq : mssm - p ] ) , it relaxes and then moves very slowly , commencing the second stage of the slow roll inflation .",
    "this stage ends when the field finally rolls down towards the minima of the potential at @xmath38 .",
    "we had mentioned earlier that potentials of the type  ( [ eq : mssm - p ] ) are encountered in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , and that their role as an inflaton has been analyzed recently  @xcite . at this point",
    "it is important that we highlight the differences between mssm inflation and the scenario we are considering . in mssm inflation , the point of inflection is located at sub - planckian values ( i.e. @xmath39 ) which can be an advantage as it avoids the problems associated with having super - planckian values for the field . in contrast , in our case , as emphasized above , the saddle point should be located around the planck scale ( i.e. @xmath40 ) , if we are to achieve the second period of slow roll before the end of inflation .",
    "however , in the mssm case , to have successful inflation , the initial values of @xmath24 and @xmath36 have to be finely tuned so that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "but , in our scenario , we do not require such fine tuning of the initial conditions on @xmath24 and @xmath36 . instead , we require for the location of @xmath32 .",
    "though the parameters of the potential that we work with are different from the mssm case , we nevertheless believe that it may be possible to realize the potential  ( [ eq : mssm - p ] ) in theories beyond the standard model , such as , for instance , string theory ( in this context , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for example",
    ", it is known that the existence of a number of string axion fields can give rise to the following potential describing multi - field chaotic inflation  @xcite : v(_i ) = _ i  ( ) m_i^2 _ i^2 , with the initial field displacements smaller than unity .",
    "the dynamics and the inflationary predictions in such examples are surprisingly similar to the corresponding single field chaotic inflation models  @xcite , due to the assisted inflation mechanism  @xcite .",
    "similarly , with enough number of fields and with the non - renormalizable superpotential w = () ( ) , [ eq : sp ] and the corresponding @xmath43 term and the soft mass term , one might be able to build an inflation model that is effectively equivalent to the single field one described by the potential  ( [ eq : mssm - p ] ) .",
    "( note that , for clarity , we have temporarily restored @xmath44 in the expression  ( [ eq : sp ] ) above . )",
    "in this section , after providing general arguments for the form of the scalar spectra that we can expect from our model , we present the spectra evaluated numerically .",
    "let us begin by quickly summarizing the essential equations and the quantities that we are interested in  @xcite .",
    "the curvature perturbation @xmath6 satisfies the differential equation _ k+2  ( ) r_k + k^2 r_k=0,[eq : derk ] where the quantity @xmath45 is given by z = (a/h ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 denotes the scale factor , @xmath24 the background inflaton , and @xmath47 is the conformal hubble factor given by @xmath48 .",
    "the scalar power spectrum @xmath49 is then defined as _ _",
    "s(k ) =  ( ) _ k^2 , with the amplitude of the curvature perturbation @xmath6 evaluated , in general , in the super - hubble limit .",

    "t(k ) =  ( ) _ k^2 , where , as in the scalar case , the tensor amplitude @xmath50 is evaluated at super - hubble scales . finally , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath52 is defined as follows : r  ( ) .      before we evaluate the scalar spectra numerically ,",
    "let us broadly try and understand the spectra that we can expect to arise in the slow - fast - slow roll scenario that we are interested in .",
    "consider modes that exit the hubble scale during an epoch of slow roll inflation .",
    "provided there is no deviation from slow roll soon after the modes leave the hubble radius , the amplitude of these modes will remain constant at super - hubble scales . therefore , their amplitude is determined by their value at hubble exit , and the scalar power spectrum corresponding to these modes can be expressed in terms of the potential as follows  @xcite : _ _",
    "s(k )  ( )  ( ) . however , if there is a period of deviation from slow roll inflation , then the asymptotic ( i.e. the extreme super - hubble ) amplitude of the modes that leave the hubble radius _",
    "just before _ the deviation are enhanced when compared to their value at hubble exit  @xcite . while modes that leave well before the deviation remain unaffected , it is found that there exists an intermediate range of modes whose amplitudes are actually _ suppressed _ at super - hubble scales  @xcite . as a result , in the slow - fast - slow roll scenario of our interest ,",
    "the scalar power spectrum is initially characterized by a sharp dip and a rise corresponding to modes that leave the hubble radius just before the transition to fast roll . then arises a regime of nearly scale invariant spectrum corresponding to modes that leave during the second stage of slow roll inflation .",
    "let us now understand the behavior of the tensor modes .",
    "in the case of the scalar modes , the quantity @xmath53 that appears in the differential equation  ( [ eq : derk ] ) turns out to be negative during a period of fast roll , and it is this feature that proves to be responsible for the amplification or the suppression of the modes at super - hubble scales  @xcite . in contrast , the coefficient of the friction term in the equation  ( [ eq : deuk ] ) that describes the tensor modes , viz .",
    "@xmath54 , is a positive definite quantity .",

    "however , in the models we consider , the tensor - to - scalar ratio proves to be smaller than @xmath55 over the scales of cosmological interest .",
    "so , we completely ignore the contribution due to the gravitational waves in our analysis .",
    "we retain the standard background cosmological parameters , and we introduce the following three parameters to describe the inflationary perturbation spectrum : @xmath14 , @xmath22 and @xmath92 . while @xmath14 appears explicitly in the potential  ( [ eq : mssm - p ] ) ,",

    "[ fig : lh - n3 ] and  [ fig:2dc3 ] that the constraint on the parameter @xmath14 is prior dominated . in our model , it is the parameter  @xmath14 that determines the amplitude of the power spectrum when it is nearly scale invariant .",

    "we should also emphasize here that the improvement in the fit that we have achieved is not only due to the cut - off in the scalar power spectrum , but also because of the presence of the oscillations at the top of the spectrum , just before it turns scale invariant . also , note the difference in the angular power spectrum for our model and the standard power law spectrum at the higher multipoles , which we have illustrated in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] .",

    "we emphasize the fact that the difference between these models has immediate observational consequences .      in this work ,",
    "we have investigated a two stage slow roll inflationary scenario sandwiching an intermediate period of deviation from inflation , driven by potentials that are similar in shape to certain mssm potentials  @xcite . in the mssm case ,",
    "inflation occurs when the field values are much smaller than the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "however , in our case , since we demand two epochs of slow roll , it necessarily requires that the initial values of the field ( assuming , say , about @xmath9 @xmath10-folds of inflation ) be greater than @xmath97 .",
    "the period of fast roll period produces a sharp drop in the scalar power spectrum for the modes that leave the hubble radius just before the second slow roll phase .",
    "we choose our scales such that the drop in power corresponds to the largest cosmological scales observable today .",
    "we find that the resulting scalar power spectrum provides a much better fit to the recent wmap data than the canonical , nearly scale invariant , power law , primordial spectrum .      at this stage",
    ", it is important that we compare our results with those obtained in another single field model that has been studied before .",
    "as we had mentioned in the introduction , an initial kinetic dominated ( i.e. fast roll ) stage preceding slow roll inflation , driven by a quadratic potential has been considered earlier to provide a sharp drop in the scalar power spectrum at large scales  @xcite . at first glance ,",
    "one may be tempted to conclude that the model we have studied here is equivalent to such a scenario if we disregard the first slow roll stage , since we have a kinetic dominated phase preceding a period of slow roll inflation . however , there are crucial differences between the two models which we have outlined below .",
    "to begin with , in the model we consider , there is no freedom to choose the type of fast roll ( say , the equation of state during the epoch of fast roll ) .",
    "it is fixed once we have chosen the parameters so as to fit the observations .",
    "secondly , in the scenario considered earlier , the modes which are outside the hubble radius during the kinetic dominated phase _ would have always remained so _ in the past  @xcite .",
    "the authors assume that somehow there may have been a previous phase of inflation , during which they were inside the hubble radius and began life in the bunch - davies vacuum . while it is not impossible to think of situations where there may have been a previous inflationary epoch  for instance , it can be achieved by invoking another scalar field  @xcite  the consequences can be quite different .",
    "in contrast , in the scenario that we have considered here , the standard , sub - hubble , bunch - davies , initial conditions have been imposed on _ all _ the modes .",
    "thirdly , it was argued that , since the suppression of power for the scalar spectrum proves to be sharper than that of the tensor , the tensor - to - scalar ratio  @xmath52 displays a sharp rise towards large physical scales  @xcite , a feature that may possibly be detected by upcoming missions such as , for instance , planck  @xcite .",
    "however , in the models that we consider , the tensor amplitude on scales of cosmological interest proves to be too small ( @xmath98 ) to be detectable in the very near future . in conclusion , we would like to mention that a detection of the @xmath99 modes corresponding to , say , @xmath100 , can rule out the class of models that we have considered in this work .",

    "<S> we investigate inflationary scenarios driven by a class of potentials which are similar in form to those that arise in certain minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these potentials allow a brief period of departure from inflation sandwiched between two stages of slow roll inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that such a background behavior leads to a step like feature in the scalar power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we set the scales such that the drop in the power spectrum occurs at a length scale that corresponds to the hubble radius today  a feature that seems necessary to explain the lower power observed in the quadrupole moment of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a markov chain monte carlo analysis to determine the values of the model parameters that provide the best fit to the recent wmap @xmath0-year data for the cmb angular power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that an inflationary spectrum with a suppression of power at large scales that we obtain leads to a much better fit ( with just one extra parameter , @xmath1 improves by @xmath2 ) of the observed data when compared to the best fit reference @xmath3cdm model with a featureless , power law , primordial spectrum . </S>"
