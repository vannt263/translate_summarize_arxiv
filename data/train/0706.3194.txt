    "a blackbody with temperature @xmath13 and a radius of @xmath14 could describe _ rosat _ spectrum while the nebular emission , clearly non - thermal , could be ascribed to synchrotron emission originated from the interaction of the high - energy particle pulsar wind with the interstellar medium .",

    "the _ xmm - newton _ telescopes angular resolution , however , does not allow to resolve the psr from the pwn . indeed no spatial selection can disentangle the point source from the diffuse emission .      to get a clear view of the spatial distribution of the bright nebular emission , we analysed the two _ chandra _ hrc - imaging archive observations of the , performed after the january 2000 glitch .",

    "all these observations were reprocessed with ciao v3.2 , applying aspect solution and degap correction , as well as reducing tap - ringing distortion . the resulting image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hrc ] ) shows the well known structure of the vela pwn : the two `` arcs '' and the `` jet / counter - jet '' feature protruding from the point source @xcite .",
    "to perform the spectral analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data on the vela pulsar , we exploit both the spectral and temporal resolution of the epic / pn camera .",
    "to disentangle the psr photons from the pwn ones , we take advantage of their different space distribution : while the psr photons follow the instrument psf , the nebular ones do not .    to estimate the nebular contribution in the epic / pn event file ,    * we extract spectra from concentric annular regions of increasing radii ; * we determine the psr contribution in each spectrum as a function of the psf and of the encircled energy fraction ( eef ) ; * we determine the pwn contribution in each spectrum using a surface brightness map of the nebular emission derived from _",

    "[ fig : spectra ] where their composite nature is clearly visible : while at lower energies the thermal spectrum prevails , with the flux values in the 4 different extraction regions proportional to eef , at higher energies almost all the photons detected are produced by the pwn and the flux values are proportional to the spatial distribution of the nebula surface brightness . since background estimate will be provided by the spectral fitting , we avoid background subtraction .",
    "we chose the energy range @xmath20 and we rebinned the spectra in order to have at least 30 counts per spectral bin and no more than 3 spectral bins per energy resolution interval .",
    "owing to the extended nature of the diffuse nebular emission we generated effective area files with the prescription for extended sources , without modelling the psf distribution of the source counts .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ telescopes radially averaged psf profile at distance @xmath21 from the aimpoint is well described by the king s profile @xcite : @xmath22 ^ { -\\alpha } , \\label{eq : king}\\ ] ] where the core radius @xmath23 and the slope @xmath24 vary as a function of the photon energy and off - axis angle and @xmath25 is a constant normalisation factor .",

    "the source is always at the centre of the field - of - view , we used the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , corresponding to an energy of @xmath30 and an offset angle of 0.0 degrees .",
    "the eef , i.e. the fraction of energy collected within a certain radius @xmath31 from the source distribution centroid , is simply the integral of ( [ eq : king ] ) times the radius over the radius , normalised at 5 : @xmath32 ^{1.59 - 1}}}{1 - \\frac{1 } { \\left [ 1 + \\left ( \\frac{5 ' } { 5.504 ' } \\right ) ^2 \\right ] ^{1.59 - 1}}}. \\label{eq : ee}\\ ] ]    since the source is not strictly monochromatic , we calculated the fraction of energy encircled in the spectra extraction regions also for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , in order to obtain a `` confidence interval '' .",

    "more than @xmath35 of the pulsar counts falls within 3 from the centroid of the distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "thus , outside this small region , the images represent a good approximation of the brightness spatial distribution in the energy range @xmath36 .",
    "since we needed an estimate of the pwn flux in the proximity of the position of the pulsar , a two dimensional model of a point - like source flux distribution was obtained with a simulation performed with chart and marx .",
    "a 2d fitting was then performed on the hrc images with the addition of a spatially constant contribution from the pwn .",
    "best fit count rates found for the region between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , corresponding to @xmath39 , are reported in table  [ tab : pwn ] for the three different hrc - i exposures .",
    "following the criterion by @xcite , the region inside @xmath38 , @xmath40 , was excised from all images and replaced with a poissonian distribution with a mean value equal to the best fit count rate .    in order to take into account the angular resolution of the _ xmm _ telescopes , the maps obtained were convolved with a lorentzian kernel of @xmath41 corresponding to a fwhm of the distribution of @xmath42 , the nominal fwhm of the _ xmm _ mirrors .",
    "finally , the convolved image was used to compute the encircled pwn fraction in each extraction region of our _ xmm _ image .",
    "the _ xmm _ spectra extracted from the four annuli ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) were fitted simultaneously using the following combination : + ( interstellar absorption)@xmath43(@xmath44(psr model)+@xmath45(pwn model ) ) + where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the psr and pwn encircled fractions within the @xmath46 extraction region ( see sect .",
    "[ par : psreef ] and [ par : pwneef ] ) . the interstellar absorption does not depend on @xmath47 .",
    "the pwn model is a power law whose index @xmath48 is allowed to vary among different regions , while the model describing the psr emission does not depend on @xmath47 .",
    "our approach simultaneously resolve the psr and pwn emission and compute best fit parameters for both the pwn and the psr models ( described in the following sections ) .",
    "the spectral fitting was performed with xspec v.11.3 , in the energy range @xmath20 .",
    "the values of the coefficients are given in table  [ tab : coeff1 ] , and represent the different contribution of each region to the total flux of the point - like and diffuse emission .",
    "uncertainties on the pulsar as well as on the nebular coefficients arise from the following caveats :    * the pulsar spectrum is far from monochromatic ; * the _ xmm - newton _ psf is known within an uncertainty of @xmath49 @xcite ; * the pwn emission is known to be highly variable over a small time scale @xcite ; * the lorentzian kernel differs from the telescopes psf ; * the hrc efficiency differs from the pn one and also the telescopes effective areas have different dependencies on the energy of the incoming photons .",
    "thus , to account for all uncertainties , an overall systematic error of @xmath50 has been added .",
    "the overall ( absorption + psr + pwn ) best fit model , summarised in table  [ tab : fit ] , allows us to determine the nebular background flux and photon index for all spectra .",
    "in particular we found that the inner circle contains @xmath51 from the psr and @xmath52 from the pwn ( note that only @xmath53 of the pulsar counts are contained in this region - see table  [ tab : coeff1 ] and  [ tab : coeff2 ] ) .",
    "from table  [ tab : fit ] we can see that the non - thermal nebular emission , whose photon index in the 4 concentric regions are @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , become softer as the distance from the pulsar increases .",
    "the result is consistent with _",
    "chandra_-acis spectra obtained from 30 november 2000 observation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the power - law normalisation yields the pwn flux within 40from the psr in the epic / pn data , its value turns out to be * @xmath58 * , in the range @xmath59 .",
    "a large part of the pwn lies outside such region . in order to estimate the flux of the remaining portion of the pwn inside the pn field of view , we extracted a spectrum from the whole detector , excluding the 40circle centered on the psr , as well as a stripe affected by psr out - of - time events .",
    "ad - hoc response matrix and effective area file were generated .",
    "we fitted an absorbed power law model to the spectrum in the range @xmath60 , which yielded a best fit photon index of @xmath61 and an unabsorbed @xmath59 flux of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , 140 d.o.f . ) .",
    "thus , the total flux of the pwn inside the pn field of view is @xmath64 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath65 at the parallactic distance ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "such value is in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "the spectral distribution of the @xmath67 vela psr photons detected in the inner 10 radius circle , can be described as the superposition of different components .",
    "a simple blackbody thermal model does not fit well the observed spectra , that appear harder than a simple planckian emission .",
    "the structure of the residuals suggests the addition of a second `` pulsar '' component : both a second blackbody or a power - law gave acceptable fits .",
    "similar results were obtained with a _ magnetised hydrogen atmosphere + power - law _ model .",
    "the interstellar column density of @xmath68 , inferred from the different models , is in good agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite . for the double blackbody model we obtained @xmath69 ( 1010 degrees of freedom ) . assuming a parallactic distance of @xmath70 , the soft spectrum is described by a cooler ( @xmath71 ) component , with a radius @xmath2 and a smaller and hotter one of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "an equally good fit was obtained with a @xmath72 power - law ; in this case the blackbody is found to have a temperature @xmath73 and a radius @xmath74 .",
    "the power - law is much steeper than that observed in all other x - ray emitting pulsars .",
    "a hydrogen atmosphere plus power - law model yields a slightly better fit ( @xmath75 for 1010 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the surface temperature , for a radius @xmath76 and a magnetic field @xmath77 , is @xmath78 ; the best fit distance @xmath79 agrees with the parallattic measurements .",
    "the power - law photon index @xmath80 is however steeper that the one found by @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3m_dart_eufs ] , we plotted the vela unfolded spectrum together with those of geminga , psr  b1055 - 52 and psrb0656 + 14 @xcite . in the case of vela",
    "we subtracted the pwn contribution as estimated from spectral fitting .",
    "given the similarities between the four _ xmm - newton _ pulsar spectra , we decided to analyse the vela data using a phenomenological model encompassing two blackbody and a power law component @xcite .",
    "the temporal resolution of the pn ccds in `` small window '' readout mode is 5.6718 ms .",
    "thus , the time - tagged xmm - pn photons are perfectly suited to study the modulation of the vela psr flux as a function of its @xmath81 89 msec rotation period .",
    "the photon arrival times were corrected for the discrete sampling due to the ccd readout and converted to the solar system barycentre with the sas task _",
    "barycen_. source counts were extracted from the same region used for spectral analysis after subtraction of the non point source contribution .",
    "epoch folding yields a strong signal at the pulsar frequency . following the prescription of for high accuracy period determination and error evaluation , we found @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively for observation 0111080101 and 0111080201 .",
    "such values agree with the contemporary radio ephemeris , kindly provided by atnf ( r. dodson , private communication ) and reported in table  [ tab : ef ] .",
    "the temporal series were then merged and folded using the radio @xmath84 and @xmath85 , to align in phase x - ray and radio light curves .",
    "the overall ( 0.210 kev ) x - ray light curve shows 3 broad peaks per period marked @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 in fig .",
    "[ fig : curva_pn_tot ] .",
    "the first and highest peak is phase aligned with the first @xmath12-ray peak and follows the radio peak by @xmath8 in phase .",
    "the second one , the lowest in this energy range , reaches its maximum at @xmath89 , and corresponds to the rxte peak 2-soft @xcite and uv @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the third peak , which has an intermediate intensity , occurs at @xmath91 ; it appears in the soft x - ray light curve and is not present at any other wavelength .",
    "the nebular background emission accounts for @xmath92 of the observed flux ; the net count rate has a pulsed fraction of @xmath93 ( where pulsed fraction is defined as the ratio between number of counts above the minimum and total number of counts ) .",
    "we note the presence of a pulsed signal also at energies above 2 kev , where the contribution from the two blackbody thermal emission model used to describe vela spectrum is negligible .",
    "this would imply a non thermal origin for the pulsed emission above 2 kev , a component that was hidden by the nebular emission in the phase - integrated spectrum .",
    "we estimated the 28 kev vela light curve to be about @xmath94 pulsed .",
    "however , we stress that , in such an energy range , the source signal accounts for a small fraction ( less of @xmath50 ) of the photons detected , so that a small error in the background estimate would translate into a big uncertainty in the pulsed fraction .    fig .  [",
    "fig : curve_luce ] summarizes the multiwavelength behaviour of the vela pulsar .",
    "significant differences are seen in the pulse profile emerging from the two energy - resolved epic / pn light curves : in the energy range 28 kev the second peak is stronger than at lower energies and the third peak is not observable ; the phase interval @xmath95 appears more complex at energies above 2 kev , with 3 distinct peaks , two coinciding with the optical third and fourth peak , and one phase aligned with the first hard x - ray and @xmath12-ray peak .",
    "since in the _ xmm - newton _ domain the _ pulse _ shape of the changes with energy , we expect a variation of the _ spectral _ shape as a function of the psr rotation . to study such a modulation we extract spectra from 20 different phase intervals .",
    "the spectra were rebinned in order to have at least 30 counts per bin . following the approach of @xcite and @xcite",
    "we have compared the phase - resolved spectra with the two blackbody best fit model using the two normalisation coefficients as free parameters .",
    "such an approach works well for all the phase resolved spectra but for that encompassing phase interval @xmath96 which is characterized by high energy residuals , impossible to account for with the two blackbody model .",
    "the spectrum of such a phase interval is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_5_renorm ] .    leaving the temperature of the two blackbodies and the hydrogen column density fixed to the values found above , a power - law with photon index @xmath97 is required to fit the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_5_bf ] ) for the @xmath96 interval .",
    "the normalization of the power - law is @xmath98 times lower than the nebular emission in this phase interval , thus , its contribution to the phase - integrated spectrum is @xmath99 times lower than the nebular one and it can not be seen in the total vela spectrum .",
    "following the detection of a non - thermal component , we decided to perform spectral fitting with a three component source model ( two blackbodies + power - law ) plus the background model to account for the nebular emission .",
    "as in the previous case , the blackbody temperatures where fixed to the values best fitting the total vela spectrum while a power - law photon index of 2.2 was used .",
    "the best fitting parameters are given in table  [ table : phase_res_norm ] while an animated version of the phase resolved spectra can be found in http://www.iasf - milano.inaf.it/@xmath81deluca / vela/. from the blackbody emissions , we can compute blackbody radii ( at parallactic distance ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_res ] we reported the variation of blackbody radii and power - law normalization as a function of the rotational phase .",
    "the hotter blackbody presents a low modulation , with a single broad peak per period .",
    "the cooler one shows a more complex modulation with possibly two peaks per period , with a small `` dip '' between them , well aligned with the radio pulse .",
    "the cooler component first maximum ( r@xmath100 ) trails the radio pulse phase by about @xmath101 ( @xmath102 in phase ) .",
    "after such maximum , the emitting area suddenly decreases to reach its minimum ( r@xmath103 ) , at @xmath104 , the same phase of the absolute minimum of the vela soft x - ray flux ; the cool blackbody radius then slowly grows and reaches its second and more pronounced maximum ( r@xmath105 ) at phase 0.8 - 0.85 responsible for the third _ xmm _ light curve peak which is not seen in hard x - rays , nor in the ultraviolet or optical light curves .    the hotter blackbody peaks , with a maximum radius of about @xmath106 , at the same phase of the first cool blackbody peak , trailing by 0.1 - 0.15 in phase the radio pulse , long known to mark the pulsar polar region .",
    "the minimum of the hot blackbody emission occurs at about 180  from the maximum and trails the minimum of the cooler emission by @xmath107 in phase .",
    "the transition from the minimum to the maximum state is not symmetric , as the growth is sharper than the descent .",
    "the non - thermal emission is present with a narrow peak between @xmath108 and @xmath109 , between the two thermal emissions minima .",
    "the power - law normalisation is found to be consistent with zero in all other phase intervals . such non thermal component is responsible for the second peak observed in the 28 kev epic light curve and seems to be connected with the narrow `` spike '' in the nuv / fuv light curves and with the `` peak 2-soft '' detected with _",
    "rxte_. the power - law photon index also agrees with the value found in _",
    "phase - resolved spectroscopy @xcite in the same phase interval .",
    "the peak corresponds to the `` leading wing 2 '' in the egret energy range .",
    "considering the different spectral components identified in the epic / pn data we note that the maximum extension of the hotter thermally emitting region is observed when looking at the polar region of the neutron star .",
    "the radius of this blackbody component is in agreement with the radius of a polar cap within a simple magnetic dipole model @xcite . for the rotational velocity of the",
    ", the polar cap radius would be @xmath110 .",
    "@xcite made an estimate of the energetics for an _ hot spot _",
    "re - heated by curvature particle downflow : with the vela parameters the bolometric luminosity would be @xmath111 and the temperature @xmath112 . both values",
    "agree with what we found .",
    "since the is known to be an inclined rotator , a terrestrial observer would face a single polar region during rotation .",
    "assuming that the hot component is produced by the polar cap region heated by return current , the gravitational bending @xcite would result in a shallow modulation of the emitting surface , in agreement with our results .",
    "the cooler blackbody would represent the radiation from the remaining part of the star surface .",
    "the radius inferred from the phase - averaged spectrum is too small to fit in any proposed equation of state for a star composed mainly of neutron .",
    "we also observe a @xmath8110@xmath113 modulation of this spectral component as a function of the rotational phase .",
    "magnetospheric reprocessing of the thermal photons emitted from the surface could provide a phase - dependent `` obscuration '' of a fraction of the neutron star surface , depending on magnetic field configuration and viewing geometry .",
    "the phenomenon of the magnetospheric `` blanket '' , e.g. cyclotron resonance scattering by plasma at a few stellar radii @xcite , originally proposed by @xcite as an explanation of the soft thermal emission of geminga , could provide the physical basis for the observation of a phase - dependent emitting area .",
    "anisotropic heat transfer from the interior of the neutron star , would also provide a surface temperature far from uniform , with the polar regions hotter than the equatorial ones @xcite .",
    "such non - uniform temperature distribution would result into a modulated x - ray thermal flux .",
    "alternatively , using a uniform surface temperature approximation , this translates into a modulation of the emitting surfaces .",
    "@xcite show that in such a case a modulation of a few percent is expected , owing to gravitational light bending .",
    "however such a modulation would have to be phase aligned with that of the hotter component .",
    "the complicate modulation we observe for the cool blackbody component is not easy to reconcile with such a picture , pointing to a more complex surface temperature distribution , and/or to magnetospheric reprocessing as discussed above .",
    "the non - thermal component detected in a small phase interval 180  from the radio pulse , when the thermal components are at their minimum , might be produced by particles accelerated in the star magnetosphere .",
    "the spectral analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data of the vela pulsar confirms the thermal nature of its emission pointing towards an x - ray phenomenology similar to that seen in older neutron stars . both the overall spectral shape and the phase - resolved behaviour are reminiscent of what has been found for middle aged pulsars such as geminga , and , affectionately called the `` three musketeers '' on view of their similarities .",
    "indeed , the three musketeers could be described , even with some caveats , with a simple common phenomenological model in which the differences in the variations of the `` hot spot '' emitting areas as a function of the rotational phase could be ascribed to the different viewing geometries of the three neutron stars which are known to be different : orthogonal rotator seen perpendicular to the rotational axis for and almost aligned for ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a full description of such a picture . ) .    while vela is certainly hotter than the older musketeers , its overall blackbody emitting radius is rather small leading to a low luminosity , well below the value expected in the standard cooling scenario described by @xcite .",
    "using a hydrogen atmosphere eases the radius problem but , yielding lower temperature , does not change the source luminosity which rests on a precisely determined parallactic distance .",
    "moreover , although vela is known to be an inclined rotator ( the angle between the magnetic dipole vector and the rotation axis is @xmath114 , while the line of sight is inclined with respect to the latter by @xmath115 , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , our phase resolved spectroscopy points to a surprisingly small modulation , typical of aligned rotators , such as , rather than orthogonal ones .",
    "the presence of a non - thermal component sharply pulsed in antiphase with the radio pulse is a surprising result of our analysis and could be exploited to better constrain the geometry of the emitting regions with the goal to unveil the emission mechanism behind vela complex multiwavelength behaviour .",
    "the remarkable body of evidence collected so far on the vela pulsar has been generally interpreted in the framework of the outer gap model @xcite where e@xmath116 couples fill the pulsar magnetosphere high above the star surface .",
