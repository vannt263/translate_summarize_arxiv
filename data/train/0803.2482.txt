    "the formation and evolution of early - type ( elliptical and lenticular ) galaxies is crucial to understanding galaxy formation .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appears to support the hypothesis that these galaxies formed relatively quickly at high redshift and have had little or no new star formation since then .",
    "however , there is evidence that the stellar populations of early - type field galaxies may have formed at lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "there are even some early - type galaxies that show evidence of star formation within the last @xmath01 gyr @xcite .",
    "these galaxies belong to a larger class of galaxies referred to as k+a ( or e+a ) galaxies discovered by @xcite .",
    "k+a galaxies are defined by their relatively strong stellar balmer absorption lines and lack of nebular emission lines ( usually h@xmath6 and/or @xmath7oii@xmath8 $ ] ) .",
    "these characteristics imply that while these galaxies formed some of their stars within the last @xmath01 gyr , they are not currently forming stars .",
    "recent studies of relatively large samples of k+a galaxies @xcite have revealed that these galaxies are preferentially found outside of galaxy clusters , implying that they may provide useful information regarding the evolution of early - type field galaxies .",
    "a detailed study of the environments of 266 k+a galaxies performed by @xcite has shown that the local galaxy density within 100 kpc of these galaxies is larger than what is found for other galaxies ; no such excess was found on size scales typical of galaxy clusters or large scale structure .",
    "this implies that these galaxies may also be tracers of galaxy - galaxy tidal interactions or possibly merger / accretion events in the field .",
    "understanding the role k+a galaxies play within the domain of galaxy evolution depends highly on our knowledge of the mechanisms which trigger and halt the star formation episodes that lead to these objects . to constrain the possible variety of such mechanisms and to obtain a more complete picture of these objects ,",
    "a sample of likely progenitors of k+a galaxies is required .",
    "while most k+a galaxies are early - type galaxies , many also have prominent disk components and spiral structure @xcite .",
    "identifying the progenitors of these k+a spiral galaxies may be difficult since current star formation is commonplace among spiral galaxies",
    ". a k+a spiral may be the result of the cessation of star formation within a relatively normal spiral as its gas is stripped via tidal interactions or ram pressure stripping within a group or cluster of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a k+a spiral may also be produced by a relatively short episode of star formation contained within the nucleus of a bulge dominated spiral .",
    "conversely , current star formation is quite rare among early - type galaxies , and it is extremely unlikely that a process such as gas stripping could produce an early - type k+a galaxy . while some have argued that mergers of spiral galaxies could produce early - type k+a galaxies @xcite , the optical and near - ir properties of the majority of k+a galaxies are consistent with the k+a spectral signature of these galaxies resulting from a short episode of star formation superimposed on an older stellar population @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems promising to try to cull a sample of candidate k+a progenitors by identifying early - type galaxies that are actively forming stars .",
    "recently , @xcite have discovered two galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) that are unambiguously elliptical galaxies that are currently forming stars . to investigate the possibility that star - forming early - type galaxies like the elliptical galaxies discovered by @xcite are plausibly the progenitors of early - type k+a galaxies , we have selected a large sample of actively star - forming early - type galaxies using the sdss spectroscopic data and images .",
    "the sample selection , including the definition of different galaxy categories , is detailed in  2 .",
    "the general properties of the sample galaxies and how they compare to k+a galaxies and early - type galaxies in general is discussed in  3 .",
    "the distribution of star formation time scales among star forming early - type galaxies is explored using population synthesis models .",
    "the model implementation and results are discussed in  4 ; further applications of the model results are discussed in  5 . in  6 ,",
    "the main results are summarised and useful follow - up observations of this sample are discussed .",
    "the selection of our sample of actively star - forming early - type galaxies consists of two basic parts .",
    "the first involves the selection of a large sample of actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "the second consists of the combined use of morphological selection criteria and visual inspection of optical images to produce from this sample a sub - sample dominated by elliptical and lenticular galaxies .",
    "we stress that the selection process was designed to yield a relatively clean sample of star forming elliptical and lenticular galaxies and is somewhat complex .",
    "this makes a meaningful comparison of the number of galaxies in the resulting sample to those in other samples difficult , and such comparisons are not part of the analysis and interpretation that follows .",
    "the two parts of this selection process are detailed below .",
    "all of the galaxy data used here are taken from the fourth data release ( dr4 ) of the sdss @xcite .",

    ", we have used the emission line fluxes measured from sdss spectra by @xcite . the basic procedure used by @xcite is as follows .",

    "this fit was then subtracted to remove the stellar continuum , a step which is vital to our efforts to obtain accurate emission line fluxes for early - type galaxies whose stellar continua , especially near the galaxies centres , are typically quite bright .",

    "[ classdef ] ) .    to construct models that can be fit to the sfe e galaxy spectra",
    ", the main assumption that we have made is that the sfe e galaxies consist of two basic stellar components , an older pre - existing population and a new population that is currently being formed .",
    "in fact , @xcite concluded that the stellar h@xmath33 absorption equivalent widths and near - ir colours of many k+a galaxies are best explained by star formation histories where relatively new ( within the last @xmath01 gyr ) stars were formed among existing older stellar populations .",
    "we note that no explicit assumption was made regarding the formation mechanism ( e.g. , monolithic collapse or major mergers ) or formation epoch for the assumed underlying older stellar population ; we only assumed that the gross spectral properties of this population can be well approximated with an instantaneous burst model at a relatively large age .",
    "we have also made the simplifying assumption that the star formation within the sfe e galaxies exponentially decreases with time . since the stellar continua alone can not be used to effectively constrain the e - folding time , @xmath61 , for this scenario , we have chosen to perform four separate fits for each spectrum , assuming @xmath62 myr , 300 myr , 1 gyr , and @xmath63 ( i.e. , a constant sfr ) . to further simplify our modelling efforts ,",
    "we have chosen to only use @xcite models that assume the initial mass function of @xcite .",
    "these assumptions allow us to use the @xcite instantaneous burst models to compute suites of model spectra for the older population and the exponentially decreasing and constant sfr models to compute the same for the younger stellar components . to this end",
    ", we have constructed a suite of 1100 spectra for each of these models using five different metallicities ( z@xmath550.0004 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 , and 0.05 ) and 220 times steps ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath65 yr .",
    "each of the model spectra was normalised by dividing by the total stellar mass at the appropriate time step which includes the @xcite computation for the amount of stellar mass loss .",
    "our basic approach for estimating the age of the younger population within each sfe e galaxy was to find the best fitting linear combination of an instantaneous past burst spectrum and one of the exponentially decreasing sfr spectra from the five suites of model spectra .",
    "the coefficients in this combination are essentially the stellar masses of the two component populations . however , in practice , we must recognise that ( i ) the stellar mass , age , and metallicity are not the only factors that affect the shapes of the spectra and ( ii ) the effects of different properties on the spectral shapes may be degenerate ( e.g. , age and metallicitiy ) .",
    "the two additional properties that must be considered when finding the best fitting model spectrum are the amount of internal dust extinction and the velocity dispersion . to simplify matters",
    ", we assumed one velocity dispersion for the combined model spectrum , the dispersion obtained for the actual galaxy spectrum using _ vdispfit _ ( see  3 ) .",
    "we have also made the simplifying assumption that the old and new populations suffer the same amount of dust extinction .",
    "this assumption is relatively good if the star forming regions occupy an area greater than or equal to the area covered by the sdss spectrograph fibre aperture .",
    "narrow - band imaging of a few or our sfe e galaxies suggests that this is indeed the case @xcite . for each spectrum ,",
    "we therefore must fit for several different parameters and we must constrain each of these as strictly as possible to overcome the degeneracy between the age of the younger population ( the main parameter we are interested in ) and any other parameter . we have done this in the following way :    1 .",
    "_ metallicity _ : we have good estimates for the oxygen abundance for the ionised gas within each sfe e galaxy from the work of @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the ionised gas is associated with the newly forming stars and that their metallicities are similar .",
    "however , over time , the metallicity of the newly formed stellar population may lag behind that of the ionised gas as the gas is continually enriched .",
    "this implies that for younger populations with relatively large ages , the o / h abundance from @xcite may overestimate the true abundance of the stars .",
    "even so , placing strict limits on the stellar metallicity is crucial to providing reasonable age estimates for the younger stellar populations and the @xcite values are the only independent metallicity estimates available .",
    "we have therefore chosen to constrain the metallicity for the younger stellar population to be within the 68% confidence interval of the o / h value given by @xcite , and caution the reader that for galaxies with relatively large age estimates for their younger populations , the o / h abundances may be somewhat inflated . + for the older population , we do not have a comparable constraint for the stellar metallicity .",
    "while accurately estimating the age of the older population is not crucial to our main goal , we may partially constrain the older population s metallicity using the spectral index [ mgfe]@xmath66 @xcite . while not independent of age , [ mgfe]@xmath66 is more strongly affected by metallicity and has the added advantage of being nearly independent of the abundance of @xmath6-elements .",
    "the latter is relevant since many early - type galaxies are known to be @xmath6-enhanced relative to the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the @xcite models assume solar values for the abundances of heavier elements relative to one another . according to the @xcite models ,",
    "an instantaneous burst population that is older than @xmath01 gyr will have a larger value of [ mgfe]@xmath66 than an actively forming population , regardless of the new population s age .",
    "this implies that the measured value of [ mgfe]@xmath66 for the actual galaxy spectrum provides a lower limit for [ mgfe]@xmath66 for the older population .",
    "the @xcite models also imply that [ mgfe]@xmath66 will not exceed 5 @xmath32 .",

    "this extinction law uses the quantity @xmath70 and takes into account the wavelength dependence of the dust extinction as well as scattering and the geometrical distribution of the dust relative to the stars .",
    "_ stellar mass and age _ : while we have no reliable estimates for the stellar masses of the older and younger stellar populations within each sfe e galaxy , we do have estimates for the total masses from @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xcite measured stellar masses using linear combinations of @xcite model spectra , implying that they do not provide stellar mass measurements that are independent of our own fitting procedure .",
    "we therefore used the @xcite value as an initial guess for the total stellar mass of each galaxy , but allowed the fitted value to vary by @xmath741 dex from this value .",
    "the fraction of the total stellar mass attributed to the younger population , @xmath75 , was used to quantify the relative contribution of each population to the total stellar mass and was only constrained to be @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the age of the younger population was constrained to be older than 1 myr while the age of the older population was constrained to older than 1 gyr ; both populations were not allowed to be older than 13 gyr .",
    "we have compiled a routine which will interpolate among the suite of instantaneous burst model spectra and one of the suites of exponentially decreasing model spectra described above to produce a composite spectrum for given values of eight parameters : ( 1 ) the age of the older population , ( 2 ) the age of younger population , @xmath78 , ( 3 ) the oxygen abundance of the younger population , o / h , ( 4 ) [ mgfe]@xmath66 for the older population , ( 5 ) the total stellar mass , @xmath79 , ( 6 ) the fraction of the stellar mass contributed by the younger population , @xmath75 , ( 7 ) the dust extinction / reddening for the ionised gas , @xmath70 , and ( 8) the stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath50 .",

    "we note that this result somewhat contradicts other similar studies which estimate that the typical e - folding time for galaxies similar to our sfe e galaxies is between 50 and 150 myr @xcite .",

    "however , if the relatively weak star formation within our sub - sample of sfe e galaxies can be shown to be confined to compact nuclear disks , this would provide concrete evidence that similar disks typically formed more recently than the rest of the stars within their host galaxies .",
    "there is other evidence that the sfe e galaxies may harbour nuclear stellar disks that are currently forming .",
    "central stellar disks are preferentially found within lower - mass early - type galaxies that have steep or `` power - law '' surface brightness profiles within radii of less than 100 pc @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to higher - mass early - type galaxies that have nearly flat or `` core '' inner profiles @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ amzsv ] , we have plotted @xmath54-band absolute magnitude versus velocity dispersion for all early - type galaxies with @xmath116 and for our sfe e galaxies . for reference , we have also highlighted the ranges in velocity dispersion inhabited by power - law and core galaxies taken from @xcite . from this plot , it can be seen that there is relatively little overlap between core and power - law galaxies and that the sfe e galaxies lie entirely within the range inhabited by power - law galaxies which tend to be the hosts of nuclear stellar disks .",
    "the gas kinematics of the sfe e galaxies are also consistent with the notion that the current star formation in these galaxies is occurring within disk - like structures . if the star formation is taking place within disks , they are likely rotationally supported .",
    "if this is the case , the effects of inclination will contribute significantly to the shape of the distribution of the ratio of the observed velocity width of the nebular emission lines , @xmath50(gas ) , and the los velocity dispersion of the stars , @xmath50(stars ) .",
    "this is because the measured stellar velocity dispersion is likely dominated by the older stellar population since , according to the model results , it typically makes up about 98% of the total stellar mass and about 70% of the total v - band luminosity of each sfe e galaxy , while the emission line gas is likely only associated with the younger stellar population .",
    "because of this , if the younger population is forming within a rotating disk , galaxies that have disks with smaller inclination angles will skew the distribution of @xmath50(gas)/@xmath50(stars ) toward lower values . in fig .",
    "[ rot ] , we plot the distribution of @xmath50(gas)/@xmath50(stars ) for the sfe e galaxies , where values for @xmath50(gas ) were taken from @xcite and the values of @xmath50(stars ) were measured using _",
    "( see  3 ) . from this figure , it can be seen that the distribution is indeed asymmetric with a larger fraction of galaxies having @xmath50(gas)/@xmath50(stars)@xmath571 .    to explore the possibility that this asymmetry is indicative of rotating gas , we have constructed the following simple models .",
    "we first made the simplifying assumption that the stellar distribution is `` pressure '' supported , i.e. , @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the circular velocity .",
    "we then allowed the gas to have both random and ordered ( i.e. , rotational ) velocity components , which are related to the circular velocity according to @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the random and ordered components , respectively . in this case , the los velocity dispersion of the gas is given by @xmath50(gas)=@xmath112 where @xmath23 is the inclination angle for the axis of rotation of the gas . combining the above relations yields the following    @xmath113^{2 } + 1}{\\left ( \\frac{v_{\\circ}}{\\sigma_{\\circ } } \\right ) ^{2 } + 1 } \\label{vrateq}\\ ] ]    -band magnitude versus the stellar velocity dispersion for all early - type galaxies ( black points ) and for sfe e galaxies ( white circles ) .",
    "the ranges in velocity dispersion inhabited by power - law and core early - type galaxies from @xcite are marked for reference . ]     for the gas , where @xmath111 and @xmath110 are the rotational and random velocity components , respectively ( see  5 ) .",
    "the red curve represents a model that assumes a log - normal distribution for @xmath114 with a median of two and a standard deviation of 0.2 dex . ]    using equation ( [ vrateq ] ) , we have constructed several model distributions for @xmath50(gas)/@xmath50(stars ) for different values for @xmath115 .",
    "for all models , we assumed that @xmath23 was distributed according to sin@xmath116 , the distribution one would expect for random orientations @xcite . to incorporate the effects of observational uncertainty",
    ", we fit a gaussian to the distribution of errors in @xmath50(gas)/@xmath50(stars ) for the sfe e galaxies and convolved each model distribution with this gaussian .",
    "these model distributions are plotted with the data in fig .",
    "[ rot ] with the gaussian kernel plotted as a model where @xmath117 .",
    "the figure demonstrates that in order to reproduce the observed distribution , some amount of rotation is required for the gas .",
    "the model curves show that a single value of @xmath115 can not reproduce the entire observed distribution and that values ranging from about two to ten are required . to better illustrate this",
    ", we have also included another model curve ( the red curve in fig .",
    "[ rot ] ) which used a log - normal distribution of values for @xmath115 with a median of two and a dispersion of 0.2 dex .",
    "this model curve is a close approximation to the observed distribution for @xmath118 and implies that @xmath115 ranges from 0.8 to five with a typical value near two .",
    "we also constructed model distributions for a scenario where the stars also have a rotational component and @xmath115 for the gas has a log - normal distribution . for this exercise , we fixed @xmath115 for the stars at 0.65 , the amount of rotation needed to produce the maximum allowed ellipticity of 0.3 ( see  2.2 ) . to reproduce the red curve in fig .",
    "[ rot ] with this model , it was necessary to increase the median value of @xmath115 for the gas to 2.3 - 2.5 , depending on how the rotation axes of the stars and gas were aligned .",
    "this implies that the estimated typical value of @xmath119 for the gas is a lower limit .",
    "this further demonstrates that not only does the observed distribution indicate the presence of rotation within the gas , it also implies that the rotational component of the gas velocity is the dominant component .",
    "we note that the observed distribution does have a tail for @xmath50(gas)/@xmath50(stars)@xmath461.6 that is not reproduced by any of the models .",
    "however , this tail consists of only 2% ( 7 galaxies ) of the sfe e sub - sample , all but one of which have errors in their gas velocities that are unusually large ( between 15% and 100% ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the data are consistent with the star forming regions in sfe e galaxies typically being contained within rotationally supported disks .",
    "since our sfe e galaxies have no prominent disks visible in their @xmath2-band images , it is reasonable to infer that the disks inferred from fig .",
    "[ rot ] may be relatively small and similar to known nuclear stellar and gas disks .",
    "in fact , the estimated typical value of @xmath119 for the gas is consistent with what has been observed for the stellar populations in the centres ( radii @xmath120 pc ) of early - type galaxies with identified nuclear stellar disks where @xmath121 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the fact that the observed distribution of @xmath122 peaks near unity implies that the ionised gas probes the same range in circular velocity as the stars . since the sdss fibre aperture extends to radii of at least 200 pc and up to 3 kpc ( or 0.1 to two effective radii ) for our sfe e galaxies , that result seems to imply that the disks may be somewhat extended .",
    "but , we must also recognise the fact that @xmath50(gas ) and @xmath50(stars ) are both luminosity weighted velocity dispersions .",
    "since the mean sersic index for our sfe e galaxies is about 4.5 , the stellar velocity dispersions must be biassed toward smaller radii , implying that the h@xmath6 surface brightness profiles must be similarly biassed . therefore , even though some spatially extended star formation may exist within these galaxies , they likely have some centrally concentrated star formation .",
    "this makes our sfe e galaxies excellent candidates for follow - up narrow - band imaging and spectroscopy to search for nuclear disks with active star formation .",
    "using the vast amount of galaxy imaging and spectroscopic data available from the sdss , we have selected a relatively large , clean sample of actively star - forming e and s0 galaxies .",
    "these galaxies make up about 3% of all early - type sdss galaxies with @xmath116 and 0.7% of all main @xcite galaxies with @xmath116 .",
    "these galaxies appear to be less massive on average than typical early - type galaxies which is consistent with what has been found by the similar , complementary study of @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with what has been found by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that the fraction of stellar mass formed at low redshift is substantially higher for lower mass early - type galaxies .",
    "the number of star forming e and s0 galaxies is also comparable with the number of morphologically similar k+a galaxies .",
    "the relatively complex selection criteria used to select both star forming e and s0 galaxies and k+a galaxies ( see  2 ) make it difficult to compare the sample sizes in a statistically robust way .",
    "however , the fact that the numbers of both types of galaxies are not vastly different does allow for the possibility that the star forming e and s0 galaxies are the progenitors of e and s0 k+a galaxies .",
    "through modelling of the stellar continua of our sfe e galaxies , we have demonstrated that this is indeed plausible .",
    "we have shown that our star - forming e and s0 galaxies likely form stars for@xmath31 gyr .",
    "the model results demonstrate that the factor that most strongly determines whether or not one of these galaxies will become a k+a galaxy is the magnitude of its star formation episode . according to our k+a definition , only star formation episodes that increase the stellar mass by roughly 2 - 5% or more will lead to k+a galaxies , which appears to be the case for about 80% of the sfe e galaxies .",
    "this suggests that in terms of star formation episode duration , all star - forming e and s0 galaxies are similar to e and s0 k+a galaxies , even though some of them will not have balmer absorption lines that are strong enough for them to be classified as k+a galaxies after their star formation has ceased .    with the implication that our samples of star - forming and k+a e and s0 galaxies are linked in an evolutionary sequence",
    "comes a large potential for followup observations .",
    "for instance , as discussed in  5 , there is evidence to suggest that star - forming e and s0 galaxies may be the sites of nuclear stellar disk formation .",
    "high spatial resolution narrow - band images of the star - forming e and s0 galaxies will be able to determine whether or not this is true .",
    "if so , e and s0 k+a galaxies will be excellent candidate hosts of nuclear stellar disks .",
    "if such disks are responsible for the galaxies strong balmer absorption , then they should appear relatively young ( i.e. , bluer than the surrounding stars ) ; this may also be explored will high spatial resolution followup imaging .",
    "identifying relatively large samples of sfe e galaxies with these types of disks will prove extremely useful for measuring central black hole masses with future spectroscopic observations ( e.g. , using nirspec with the james webb space telescope ) for relatively low mass e and s0 galaxies .",
    "this is because the kinematics of these nuclear disk structures are dominated by rotation and velocity anisotropy is relatively unimportant @xcite .",
    "however , estimates for bh masses using nuclear stellar disks are based on luminosity weighted stellar velocities measured from optical spectra which are affected by radial variations in the stellar population @xcite .",
    "rotation velocities measured for gas using emission lines are not affected by this phenomenon . in this sense",
    ", the interpretation of the kinematics of any emission line gas associated with a nuclear disk in regards to the mass of the central bh will be much more straightforward .",
    "identifying sfe e galaxies that contain such disks will therefore provide a sample for which future spectroscopy can be used to reliably estimate central bh masses .",
