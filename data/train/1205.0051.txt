    "this confirms that some sort of periodic modulation does occur on the tbte rare earth layer , which is clearly induced by the formation of the cdw state in the neighboring te@xmath3 planes .",

    "the distinct lineshape between the x - ray absorption curve and the resonant profile , defined as the diffraction peak intensity as a function of incident photon energy ( e.g. red curve in fig .",

    "the intensity of the peak decreases linearly with increasing temperature , and disappears when the sample temperature is higher than t@xmath8 .",
    "in addition , the width of the diffraction peak becomes broader at temperature near t@xmath8 .",
    "the order parameter , defined as the square root of the peak intensity , is shown in the lower panel of fig . [ fig3:t_dep_tbte3](a ) and superimposed with the results obtained from non - resonant hard x - ray diffraction measurements .",
    "near t@xmath8 , we found a good agreement on the temperature dependence of the diffraction peak between the measurement at the absorption edge of tb @xmath0-edge and far away from any of the absorption edge , behaving like an order parameter in a 2nd order phase transition .",
    "surprisingly , upon cooling the sample to temperatures well below t@xmath8 , the temperature dependence of this cdw resonant diffraction peak deviates from the expected behavior of a cdw order parameter . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3:t_dep_tbte3](b ) , the intensity of the peak dramatically increases at temperatures below 200 k. in addition , the temperature dependence of the width is also unusual : the width first decreases below t@xmath8 ; it then increases at temperatures lower than 300 k , until the temperature reaches 150 k - 200 k , where the width is seen to keep at a constant value .",
    "clearly , such anomalous resonant diffraction peak intensity enhancement at low temperatures does not reflect the magnitude of the cdw order parameter .",
    "this is further demonstrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3:t_dep_tbte3](b ) , the square root of the non - resonant hard x - ray diffraction peak intensity , which is proportional to the order parameter from lattice distortions , asymptotically approaches a constant value at low temperatures , in contrast to the temperature dependence of the resonant diffraction peak .",
    "furthermore , according to angle - resolved photoemission measurement @xcite , the temperature dependence of the cdw gap , which reflects the cdw order parameters directly from the single particle spectral function , also exhibits a saturating behavior at low temperatures , as expected from a typical 2nd order phase transition .",
    "therefore , the observed anomalous temperature dependence of the cdw resonant diffraction peak at tb @xmath0 edge is related to the properties of the tb 4@xmath10 states involved in the resonant process , in addition to the actual cdw order parameter .        in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3:t_dep_tbte3](c ) , the resonant profiles of this cdw diffraction peak at three representative temperatures are plotted .",
    "as can be seen , the lineshape of the resonant profile does not change as a function of temperature , while the overall intensity changes significantly .",
    "this confirms that the anomalous temperature dependence of the resonant diffraction peak shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3:t_dep_tbte3](a ) is not due to the change of its resonance profile .",
    "furthermore , we do not resolve noticeable temperature dependence in xas , as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3:t_dep_tbte3](c ) .",
    "this suggests that the underlying mechanism for the temperature dependence anomaly is a subtle effect on the tb 4@xmath10 states that can only be detected by a sensitive experimental probe such as resonant x - ray diffraction through the interference effect between rare earth ions with small variations in population of the crystal - field - split @xmath2 @xmath13-multiplet .",

    ", the exponential - like temperature dependence of the resonant diffraction peak is also seen for both dyte@xmath4 and cete@xmath4 .",
    "this further indicates that the anomalous temperature dependence of the cdw resonant diffraction peak is related to a common nature of the rare earth 4@xmath10 state under the influence of cdw states .",
    "we note that we have also measured gdte@xmath4 and late@xmath4 ; however , the intensity of the cdw diffraction peak is too weak to be detected , which provide another support that the cdw diffraction at _",
    "m_-edge seen in other tri - telluride is not due to the scattering of the underlying lattice distortion due to cdw formation , but is due to electronic origins .",
    "the absence of any resonant effect at the gd@xmath14 and la@xmath14 @xmath0-edge provide additional information about the nature of the resonant diffraction process at the rare earth @xmath0-edge .",
    "in particular , because neither gd@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) nor la@xmath14 ( @xmath16 ) have a spatially degenerate ground state ( both are @xmath17 states by hund s rules ) , the symmetry breaking due to the te@xmath3 plane cdw does not affect these ions and no signal is observed .",
    "these will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "in order to explain the observed resonant profile and the temperature dependence , we calculated xas for rare earth @xmath18 ions in @xmath5te@xmath4 compounds at the rare earth @xmath0 edge .",
    "we also calculated the resonant elastic x - ray scattering ( rexs ) intensity for scattering from a model charge density wave ( cdw ) and compare this with the observed resonant diffraction profile .",
    "in our model , the non - zero resonant cdw signal at rare earth @xmath0 edge exists because the cdw modifies the crystal - field environment experienced by the @xmath2 ions , affecting the crystal electric field ( cef ) splitting of the rare earth ion s @xmath13-multiplet .",
    "thermal population of the cef eigenstates leads to the observed temperature dependence of the resonant intensity . in principle the local symmetry of the rare earth ions can be determined from knowledge of the atomic displacements in the cdw state . however , in order to yield a tractable calculation of the rexs spectra we develop a simpler model in which the point symmetry of the rare earth ions is reduced from o@xmath4 to o@xmath3 with the cdw periodicity and direction .    for our @xmath18 rexs calculations ,",
    "we treat the frozen cdw as producing a spatially modulated electrostatic field at the @xmath18 site . to simplify the calculation",
    ", we assume that there are just two types of @xmath18 sites : ( a ) sites at which the effective electrostatic field is maximal ( we call these sites",

    "the cdw periodicity is approximated by a real space pattern of type 1 - 2 - 1 .",

    "the absorption spectrum for a type-2 site @xmath20 is just that of a spherically symmetric @xmath18 ion .",
    "this spectrum is calculated in the usual way as a ground state averaged over each of the degenerate hund s rule ground states ; in spherical symmetry contributions to the xas from the next highest electronic initial state are negligible at all experimentally relevant temperatures due to the boltzmann factor . for the type-1 sites ,",
    "multiplet energy levels are given by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the eigenvalue of the total angular momentum and @xmath26 the eigenvalue of the z - component of the total angular momentum .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 has the dimension of energy and has been introduced to account for the effect of the cdw on the type-1 sites .",
    "we have divided @xmath27 by j in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) so that @xmath27 represents the total splitting over the entire multiplet .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath27 will be seen to determine the temperature dependence of the rexs peak , and can thus be estimated from the experimental data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3:t_dep_tbte3](c ) . the total xas and resonant x - ray diffraction peak intensity containing these two types of ions can be obtained and compared to our experiment .",
    "importantly , as @xmath27 is comparable to the energy scale of the measurement temperature , boltzmann statistics were also included to account for the thermal population of the split @xmath2 multiplets .        to calculate the xas",
    ", we first consider the effect of a non - zero @xmath27 on the xas . in general , the xas is given by an average over initial states @xmath28 and a sum over final states @xmath29 : @xmath30 where we have set the boltzmann constant @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the partition function , @xmath33 is the temperature , @xmath34 is the incident photon energy , @xmath35 is the polarization , and @xmath36 is the sum of the position operators of the electrons on the ion .",
    "[ eq : general ] is a general formula for dipole absorption , however , we may simplify the formula if we realize that the @xmath37 hund s rule ground state energy is well - separated from the next highest excited state and thus the average over initial states can be restricted to an average over the @xmath38 ground state manifold for all experimentally relevant temperatures . for non - zero @xmath27",
    "the energy depends on both @xmath13 and @xmath39 and we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are any additional labels needed to specify the state . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lessgeneral ] ) we have replaced the delta function with a broadened lorentizian @xmath44 where the broadening is due to the lifetime of the core - hole . additionally ,",
    "because we assume that the width due to the core hole lifetime is much greater than @xmath27 we have ignored the @xmath26 dependence within the argument of the lorentzian.@xcite however , we make no assumption about the relative size of @xmath33 and @xmath27 , thus the @xmath39 dependence of the boltzmann factor must be retained .",
    "( [ eq : lessgeneral ] ) can be written in terms of reduced matrix elements and wigner three - j symbols as : @xmath45 where the quantity in the large parenthesis gives a temperature dependent weighing factor for the different possible final state @xmath46 values ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "interestingly , this weighing factor can be written in the convenient form@xcite : @xmath50    where the right hand side follows from the fact that ( for @xmath46 in the allowed range ) the squared wigner three - j symbol is in fact a quadratic polynomial in @xmath26 .",
    "thus we have a final expression for the temperature dependent xas from a single ion of type @xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 or @xmath54 , @xmath27 is the fixed symmetry breaking energy due to the frozen cdw distortion , and where @xmath55 is the partial absorption for transitions to final states with angular momentum @xmath46",
    ". the partial absorption can be obtained from well - known computer software such as cowan s code@xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath56 the argument of the average square moment is @xmath57 and the xas is just equal to the spherically symmetric spectrum .",
    "each partial absorption @xmath55 can be kramers - kronig transformed to obtain the partial rexs scattering form factor as @xmath58 and @xmath59    in fig .",

    ", we ignore the temperature dependence of cdw s order parameter ; such that the calculated temperature dependent spectrum reflect solely the effect due to the thermal occupancy of @xmath2-multiplet .",
    "the calculated xas reproduce all major features observed in the experiments ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2:rp_tbte3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4:otherrte3 ] ) , suggesting that this model captures the essential @xmath2 multiplet physics involved in the @xmath0 absorption edge .",
    "importantly , the calculated xas exhibit a weak temperature dependence , as observed in the experiment . regarding the resonant profile of cdw diffraction peak intensity , the calculated resonant profiles also capture the major characteristic feature of the experimental data ( fig .",
    "[ fig2:rp_tbte3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4:otherrte3 ] ) , exhibiting a distinct shape than the xas . furthermore ,",
    "unlike the xas , the intensity of the calculated resonant profile enhances dramatically at low temperatures , while the overall lineshape of the resonant profile is still preserved .",
    "our calculation shows that the resonant diffraction peak intensity increases exponentially , as observed experimentally .",
    "this exponential - like temperature dependence is due to the fact that @xmath27 is of the same order as the measurement temperature ; as a consequence , the thermal occupancy of the split @xmath2 multiplet , which is governed by boltzmann factor , dominates the temperature dependence of the cdw resonant diffraction peak intensity .",
    "also , consistent with the experimental observations , the rexs intensity for both late@xmath4 and gdte@xmath4 is identically zero in theory .",
    "this is obviously the case for late@xmath4 which has a non - degenerate @xmath60 ground state and can not be further split by the symmetry breaking field .",
    "the gdte@xmath4 ground state is spatially symmetric @xmath17 but degenerate due to the spin @xmath61 . however , a spatial perturbation such as that due to the cdw field can not split the spin degeneracy and thus there can not be a rexs signal for the gdte@xmath4 system either .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "a general cdw perturbation @xmath62 which acts only on spatial variables can be written in second quantization as @xmath63 where the @xmath64 are numbers , the indices @xmath65 and @xmath66 refer to a complete set of spatial basis functions , and the index @xmath67 labels the spin . using the explicit form given above it is straightforward to show @xmath68=0\\;.\\ ] ] in order for the perturbation not to spilt the degeneracies of any atomic multiplet states , we might try to show that for gdte@xmath4 @xmath69\\stackrel{?}{=}0\\;.\\ ] ] this is not generally true , however , we only require a weaker condition : @xmath62 commute with @xmath70 within the ground state manifold .",
    "but , within the ground state manifold we have already seen that we may set @xmath17 . thus , @xmath71=[\\delta h,\\vec l+\\vec s]\\to[\\delta h,\\vec s]=0\\;.\\ ] ] because the perturbation commutes with @xmath13 in the ground state manifold the total hamiltonian commutes with @xmath13 which thus remains a good quantum number .",
    "usually , the cef parameters are determined by inelastic neutron scattering , or , by optical spectroscopy  two techniques for which the associated energy scale is clearly well suited .",
    "however , these two techniques measure spatially averaged cef parameter , not able to distinguish a periodic modulated cef effect , like the present cases . here",
    ", using resonant x - ray diffraction , the 4@xmath10 multiplet splitting parameter , @xmath27 , can be estimated .",
    "we fit the experimental temperature dependence data to the theoretical model , yielding value of @xmath27 for tb , dy , and ce to be approximately 4 mev , 2 mev , and 20 mev , respectively .",
    "therefore , when compared to typical electronic energy scales , the @xmath2 multiplet splitting is small and thus difficult to resolve for spectroscopies which measure electronic structure such as xas .",
    "the rexs , however , is sensitive to this small energy scale due to the quantum interference which results in a spectrum proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "we also remark that the values of @xmath27 fitted from our data are on the order of the expected change in @xmath2-@xmath73 hybridization energy due to the cdw distortion .",
    "the hybridization energy between the rare earth @xmath2 electrons and te @xmath73 electrons is estimated to be@xcite approximately @xmath74 ev .",
    "this energy varies with distance as the inverse fifth power of the distance between ions@xcite .",
    "thus the magnitude of the percent change in hybridization energy is five times the percentage change in bond distance associated with the cdw distortion . according to non - resonant x - ray diffraction@xcite , the change of the bond length is on the order of @xmath74 percent in tbte@xmath4 , corresponding to a @xmath27 approximately 5 mev , or 60k .",
    "this is consistent with the value of @xmath27 estimated from the experimental data , and a similar order of magnitude to the other estimated values from experiments .",
    "a more detailed theory of the tri - telluride materials could also include further site - types for the rare - earth ions and could attempt an _ ab initio _ calculation of spatially - dependent splitting parameters at each site .",
    "however , we do not pursue this line here as we are interested only in the qualitative effect of the cdw on the rare - earth elastic scattering .    in summary ,",
    "the periodic 4@xmath10 multiplet splitting of rare earth ions induced by a charge density wave ( cdw ) state in the family of rare earth tri - telluride was detected and measured by resonant soft x - ray diffraction near the rare earth @xmath0 absorption edge .",
    "the diffraction peak intensity exhibits an exponential increase at low temperatures , which is due to the variation of the thermal occupancy of rare earth 4@xmath10 multiplet .",
    "our results also demonstrate that the resonant peak intensity does not necessarily simply represent the order parameters of cdw state ; thermal averaging of the ground states and intermediate states can also contribute to the measured temperature dependence of the diffraction peak , when their band width are comparable to the measurement temperatures .",
