    "in many supersymmetric models conserving r - parity , the neutralino as lightest supersymmetric particle , is considered to be a candidate for cold dark matter if its density does not over - close the universe  @xcite .",
    "experiments aiming at a direct detection of these weakly indirecting massive particles ( wimp ) exist and are summarized in  @xcite",
    ". on the other hand , at accelerator experiment , a lower limit on the mass of the neutralino can be also extracted and results from the combination of direct susy searches ( charginos , sleptons , ... ) .",
    "first the susy model used at lep to obtain the excluded regions and the strategy to set a lower limit on the mass of the neutralino are discussed . then the signal and background topologies are explained .",
    "the exclusion and the limit on the neutralino mass are shown in section 3 , including a discussion of the main sources of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "finally , the impact of higgs search is presented .",
    "most of the results are interpreted at lep in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) with r - parity conservation and with the assumption of gut mass unification . in this model",
    "a few parameters are enough to describe the properties of susy particles :    * m@xmath1 : the common sfermion mass at the gut scale * m@xmath2 : the common gaugino mass at the gut scale * a@xmath1 : the universal trilinear coupling * tan@xmath3 : the ratio of the two higgs doublet vacuum expectation values * @xmath4 : the higgsino mass parameter * m@xmath5 : the cp - odd higgs boson mass , relevant for the higgs sector    the corresponding parameters at the electroweak scale are obtained by solving the renormalization group equations . in practice m@xmath6 is used as a free parameter instead of m@xmath2 . from m@xmath1 , m@xmath6 and tan@xmath3",
    "the slepton masses are derived , with the typical hierarchy : @xmath7 . as an example",
    "the slepton right mass can be written as : @xmath8    the chargino and neutralino masses and couplings are fully specified by m@xmath6 , @xmath4 , tan@xmath3 .",
    "if mixing in the scalar sector is not considered , the set of free parameters is reduced to : m@xmath6 , @xmath4 , tan@xmath3 , m@xmath1 . a scan over this 4-parameter space is performed to search for the lowest allowed neutralino mass .",
    "two regions , with distinct characteristics depending on the scalar mass m@xmath1 , exist . for large scalar masses , chargino and neutralino limits",
    "are used . for low scalar masses , sleptons results must be included .",
    "additional regions are excluded by higgs constraints , especially for low tan@xmath3 . in order to be conservative",
    ", neutralino decays involving higgs bosons are usually inhibited .",
    "since 1995 , the lep2 @xmath9 collider has regularly increased its center of mass energy beyond the z resonance .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] shows the luminosity accumulated by aleph up to 1999 .",

    ".luminosity accumulated by the aleph experiment [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    the main characteristic of susy signals is the presence of neutralinos in the final state escaping detection , leading to acoplanar jets , acoplanar leptons or mixed jet / lepton topology .",
    "these events have a large missing mass and missing transverse momentum which depends strongly on the mass difference ( @xmath10 ) between the produced particle ( chargino , slepton or heavy neutralino ) and the neutralino ( lsp ) , one of the decay products . specific analyses have been designed depending on the mass difference and on the final state  @xcite .",
    "the cross section of the main standard model backgrounds is presented in figure [ fig1 ] :    * for small @xmath10 , the @xmath11 background is typically three orders of magnitude larger than expected signal , but cuts on missing mass or missing transverse momentum reduce this background to a very low level . * for large @xmath10",
    ", the qcd background can be easily rejected and the dominant background ( ww , we@xmath12 and zz ) is almost irreducible for some final states .",
    "the sleptons are produced by pair in the s - channel via @xmath13 , and in the t - channel via neutralino exchange , leading to an increase of the cross section for selectron production .",
    "the final state consists of two leptons and two neutralinos ( the efficiency for cascade decays is assumed to be zero ) .",
    "no evidence of a signal was observed , e.g. in the 1999 data , 42 events were observed while 39 were expected from background @xcite .",
    "the main background comes from leptonic decays of ww events ( the ww background is subtracted in all analyses involving at least one lepton ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the limits obtained in the selectron - neutralino plane .",
    "typically selectron masses up to 95 gev / c@xmath0 are excluded . as shown in equation 1 , at fixed tan@xmath3 and for small scalar masses m@xmath1 , this limit can be translated directly on a limit on m@xmath6 .",
    "charginos are produced in the s - channel wia @xmath13 and in the t - channel with sneutrino exchange .",
    "this two diagrams interfere destructively for low scalar masses resulting in a reduction of the cross section .",
    "the decay proceeds via a three - body decay ( w@xmath14 ) or a two - body decay ( sneutrino - lepton for instance ) , leading to final states of 4-jets , 2-jets - lepton , and 2-leptons .",
    "a map of the efficiency and background expectation has been computed as a function of @xmath10 and the leptonic branching ratio . for heavy ( light ) sfermions , 9 ( 24 ) candidates are observed in 1999 data , while the expectation from background is 12.7 ( 33.9 ) . the chargino exclusion for large scalar masses , shown in figure  [ fig2 ] reaches the kinematic limit . for low scalar masses ,",
    "when the chargino and sneutrino are almost mass - degenerate ( a few gev ) , the final state is practically invisible as the lepton energy , from the chargino decay , is too soft , leading to a non excluded corridor which is displayed on figure  [ fig4 ] .",

    "all neutralino production channels ( @xmath15 ... ) are taken into account .",
    "final states considered are acoplanar jets and acoplanar leptons for low m@xmath1 . for heavy ( light ) sfermions , 5 ( 78 ) candidates are observed , while 3.1 ( 87.7 ) are expected from background . for large scalar masses ,",
    "the neutralinos are useful in the higgsino region ( @xmath16 ) for low tan@xmath3 and negative @xmath4 as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] as they exclude region above the chargino kinematic limit .      for large scalar masses the chargino and neutralino exclusions",
    "have been combined and figure  [ fig4 ] shows the limit on the neutralino mass as a function of tan@xmath3 .",
    "the limit , given by neutralinos with @xmath17 production for tan@xmath18 , is @xmath19 37 gev / c@xmath0 at 95 % cl for m@xmath20 500 gev / c@xmath0 .    to extract the absolute limit obtained for any m@xmath1 ,",
    "first the chargino and slepton searches are combined via parametrisations of efficiency and maps of background .",
    "then for each ( m@xmath1 , tan@xmath3 ) , for all the points not yet excluded with a neutralino mass @xmath21 38 gev / c@xmath0 , neutralino events are simulated , reconstructed and the analyses applied to determine if the point is excluded .",
    "the combined limit is :    @xmath22 35 gev / c@xmath0 at 95 % cl for any m@xmath1 and tan@xmath3      a few caveats concerning the robustness of the lsp mass limit should be mentioned :    * the dependence of the limit on the mixing parameters , which induce an enhancement of chargino and neutralino decays to taus , must be studied . * radiative corrections to chargino and neutralino",
    "masses decrease the limit by about 1 gev in the region where the limit is found . *",
    "higher order corrections to the one - loop gut relation between m@xmath23 and m@xmath6 introduce a variation of a few @xmath24 on the lsp mass limit .",
    "the typical uncertainty on the lsp mass limit is therefore about 2 gev .",
    "at tree level , the mass of the lightest supersymmetric higgs , m@xmath25 depends only on m@xmath5 and tan@xmath3 , and is bounded by @xmath26 .",
    "a limit on m@xmath25 therefore gives directly a limit on tan@xmath3 as soon as m@xmath5 is fixed . as the radiative corrections to the higgs mass introduce a dependence on the stop mass , i.e. the mixing parameter a@xmath27 , the picture has to be refined .",
    "fortunately large stop mixing , which means an increase of the higgs mass , induces also a small stop mass . using the higgs constraints for small mixing , and the stop search for large mixing , the exclusion obtained previously in the ( m@xmath6 , @xmath4 ) plane can be substantially improved for low m@xmath1 and tan@xmath3 .",
    "a scan over all possible values on m@xmath5 and a@xmath27 within the physical ranges is performed to obtain this limit . as an illustrative example , the improvement is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] at 183 gev . to update the results for a higher center of mass energy ,",
    "the stops constraints are no longer useful and the ( tan@xmath3 , m@xmath1 , m@xmath6 , @xmath4 ) plane is scanned with the following procedure @xcite :    * it has been shown that the dependence of the limit with @xmath4 is negligible , the value has been fixed to @xmath28100 gev / c@xmath0 where m@xmath25 is maximal . * m@xmath5 has been fixed to 2 tev / c@xmath0 to maximize m@xmath25 .",
    "a scan over a@xmath27 is performed to determine the highest value of @xmath29 in each point , which is compared to the aleph higgs mass limit on m@xmath25 ( 107.7 gev / c@xmath0 ) ( m@xmath27 = 175 gev / c@xmath0 is used ) . * the higgs mass limit , if the radiative corrections are small , can be translated into a limit on tan@xmath3 . in the other case , this limit can be translated into a limit on the stop mass , and therefore into a limit on @xmath30 ( assuming m@xmath1 is not too large ) .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] summarizes the exclusion obtained in the ( m@xmath6,tan@xmath3 ) plane from the higgs limit .",
    "any value of tan@xmath31 is excluded . when increasing tan@xmath3 up to about 3 , a lower limit on m@xmath6 is obtained for small scalar masses ( typically @xmath21 200 gev / c@xmath0 ) .",
    "the result of the combination of the higgs constraint with the previous limit on the neutralino mass is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "low tan@xmath3 are excluded by higgs constraints and supersedes the chargino / neutralino limit .",
    "however this limit is very sensitive , through the radiative corrections , to the top mass .",
    "if m@xmath32 gev / c@xmath0 , this exclusion do not hold , but a 40 gev / c@xmath0 neutralino mass is always excluded when tan@xmath33 . if furthermore m@xmath1 is taken to be 2 tev / c@xmath0 , no more limit from higgs can be used .",
    "then the limit is given by the charginos exclusion at large scalar masses in a tiny region of tan@xmath3 .",
    "finally increasing with tan@xmath3 , the neutralino limit is found in the corridor where charginos and neutralinos can not help .",
    "for tan@xmath34 , only the slepton search contributes and the absolute limit is  :    @xmath22 38 gev / c@xmath0 at 95 % cl for any m@xmath1 and tan@xmath3    , tan@xmath3 ) plane ( left ) , and limit on the neutralino mass combining chargino , neutralino , slepton and higgs contraints versus tan@xmath3 ( right),title=\"fig : \" ] , tan@xmath3 ) plane ( left ) , and limit on the neutralino mass combining chargino , neutralino , slepton and higgs contraints versus tan@xmath3 ( right),title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "using the large amount of data accumulated at lep2 by aleph , the combination of direct searches of susy particles can be used to extract a lower limit on the mass of the neutralino , as as the lightest supersymmetric particle . a lower limit of 35 gev / c@xmath0 on the neutralino mass is obtained for any scalar mass m@xmath1 and tan@xmath3 .",
    "moreover , a limit of 38 gev / c@xmath0 is obtained including the higgs contraints . at the end of lep operation , a value of at least 40 gev / c@xmath0 should be reached if no signal is observed .",
