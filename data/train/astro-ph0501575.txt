    "nonthermal particle acceleration at shocks is expected to be an efficient process at different evolutional stages of clusters .",
    "nonlinear wave - particle interactions being the governing process of the snr collisionless shock formation are responsible for both shock heating and compression of the thermal gas as well as for creation of energetic particle population .    a direct study of collisionless shock waves in a laboratory is an extremely difficult task .",
    "most of the experimental data on collisionless shock physics are coming from space experiments .",
    "there are direct observational data on the shock wave structure in the interplanetary medium with clear evidences for ion and electron acceleration by the shocks ( e.g. tsurutani and lin , 1985 ) .",
    "computer simulations of the full structure of collisionless shock waves describe the kinetics of multi - species particle flows and magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves in the strongly - coupled system .",
    "the problem is multi - scale .",
    "it requires a simultaneous treatment of both `` microscopic '' structure of a subshock at the thermal particle gyroradii scale where the injection process is thought to occur , and an extended `` macroscopic '' shock precursor due to energetic particles .",
    "the precursor scale is typically more than @xmath6 times of the microscopic scale of the subshock transition region .      in the strong enough collisionless shocks ( typically of a mach number above a few ) resistivity",
    "can not provide energy dissipation fast enough to create a standard shock transition ( e.g. kennel , 1985 ) on a microscopic scale .",
    "ion instabilities are important in such shocks that are called supercritical .    at the microscopic scale",
    "the front of a supercritical shock wave is a transition region occupied by magnetic field fluctuations of an amplitude @xmath7 and characteristic frequencies of about the ion gyro - frequency .",

    "the transition region of a quasi - perpendicular shock is somewhat narrower .",
    "the wave generation effects at the microscopic scale have been studied in some detail by hybrid code simulations ( e.g. quest , 1988 ) .",
    "the large - amplitude magnetic field fluctuation in the shock transition region were directly measured in the interplanetary medium ( see e.g. kan , 1990 ) .",
    "the reflected ions with a gyro - radius exceeding the width of the shock transition region can be then efficiently accelerated , via the fermi mechanism , by converging plasma fluxes carrying mhd fluctuations .",
    "the efficiency of the upstream plasma flow energy conversion into nonthermal particles could be high enough providing a hard spectrum of nonthermal particles up to some maximal energy @xmath12 .",
    "if the efficiency of ram energy transfer to the energetic particles is high enough , an extended shock precursor appears due to the incoming plasma flow deceleration by the fast particle pressure .",
    "the precursor scale @xmath13 is of the order of @xmath14  orders of magnitude larger than the width of the shock transition region . here",
    "@xmath15 is the maximal mean free path of a particle in the energy - containing part of the spectrum and @xmath16 is the shock velocity .",
    "we shall later refer that energetic particles as cosmic rays ( cr ) .",
    "the large scale ( `` macroscopic '' ) structure of a collisionless shock can be modeled by a two - fluid approach with a kinetic description of nonthermal particles ( see e.g. blandford and eichler 1987 ; malkov and drury , 2001 for a review ) or by a monte carlo method ( e.g. jones and ellison , 1991 ) . in both methods",
    "some suitable parameterization of particle scattering process must be postulated _ a priori_.",
    "it has been shown that the front of a strong collisionless shock wave consists of an extended precursor and a viscous velocity discontinuity ( subshock ) of a local mach number that is smaller than the total mach number of the shock wave .",
    "the compression of matter at the subshock can be much lower than the total compression of the medium in the shock wave with allowance for high compression in the precursor .",
    "we shall refer such shocks later as cr - modified .",
    "an important predicted feature of strong shocks with efficient cr acceleration is a possibility to amplify an initial seed magnetic field by orders of magnitude ( e.g. bell & lucek 2001 ; bell 2004 ) . cr current upstream of the strong shock could drive magnetic fluctuations on precursor scale length .",
    "the scale @xmath13 is @xmath17 which is expected to be above a kpc , moreover the width @xmath18 100 kpc for a cluster scale shock .",

    "electron kinetics in collisionless shocks is different from that of ions .",
    "most of the observable emission comes from the electrons so they require a careful study .",
    "strong shocks transfer the ram kinetic energy of the flow into large amplitude nonlinear magnetic fluctuations on a short scale of the transition region .",
    "the thermal electron velocities in the ambient medium are higher than the shock speed if the shock mach number @xmath28 , allowing for nearly - isotropic angular distribution of the electrons .",
    "non - resonant interactions of these electrons with large - amplitude turbulent fluctuations in the shock transition region could result in collisionless heating and pre - acceleration of the electrons ( bykov and uvarov , 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of large - amplitude waves in the shock transition region erodes many of the differences between quasi - parallel and transverse shocks , providing the electron injection mechanism to be similar for these shocks .",
    "an exact modeling of a collisionless shock structure with an account of the nonthermal particle acceleration effect requires a nonperturbative self - consistent description of a multi - component and multi - scale system including the strong mhd - turbulence dynamics . that modeling is not feasible at the moment .",
    "instead we will use below some simplified description of a multi - fluid strong shock structure with an appropriate parameterization of the extended pre - shock and the gas subshock .",
    "then some predicted observable characteristics of the shocks can be confronted against observational data .",
    "we will discuss first the effects of plasma heating by modified shocks and then some specific predictions for possible observational tests .",
    "the collisionless shock relaxation processes are multi - fluid . for strong collisionless shocks in a magnetized plasma",
    "the nonthermal particle acceleration effect is expected to be efficient and a significant fraction of the ram pressure could be transferred into high energy particles ( ions only for the nonrelativistic shocks ) .",
    "a strong shock of a total mach number @xmath29 1 consists of a broad precursor of a scale of @xmath30 due to the upstream gas deceleration by the nonthermal particle pressure gradient and a viscous gas subshock of the modest mach number @xmath31 3 ( see for a review blandford and eichler , 1987 ; jones and ellison , 1991 ; malkov and drury , 2001 ) .",
    "the total compression ratio @xmath32 of a strong mhd shock modified by an efficient nonthermal particle acceleration can be estimated as @xmath33 assuming that the energy density in the shock upstream is dominated by the ram pressure and that the cr escape is through the cut - off momentum regime ( e.g. malkov and drury , 2001 ) . here",
    "@xmath34 is the energy flux carried away by escaping nonthermal particles and @xmath35 is the effective adiabatic exponent .",
    "the distribution function of nonthermal particles and the bulk flow profile in the shock upstream region are sensitive to the total compression ratio @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the exact calculation of the escape flux @xmath34 can be performed only in fully nonlinear kinetic simulations .",
    "nevertheless , some approximate iterative approach can be used to make the distribution function consistent with the shock compression .",
    "the subshock is the standard gas viscous shock of a mach number @xmath36 .",
    "for that simplified steady - state model of a strong cr - modified shock the downstream ion temperature @xmath37 can be estimated ( bykov , 2004 ) for the shock of a given velocity if @xmath32 and @xmath38 are known : @xmath39    single fluid strong shock heating represents the limit @xmath40 1 , since there is no precursor in that case . in a single fluid strong shock with @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "we have @xmath43 for any magnetic field inclination ( e.g. draine and mckee , 1993 ) .",
    "the @xmath44 is the gas adiabatic exponent , the mass per particle @xmath24 was assumed to be @xmath45 \\cdot m_h$ ] and @xmath46 is the shock velocity in 10@xmath47 . in the single - fluid system",
    "the compression ratio @xmath48 does not depend on the shock velocity and the eq.([eq : tcr ] ) reduces to eq.([eq : rht1 ] ) .",
    "however in the multi - fluid shocks the total compression ratio depends on the shock velocity and could be higher than that in the single - fluid case .",
    "that implies somewhat lower postshock ion temperatures for the strong multi - fluid shock of the same velocity and could be tested observationally ( e.g. bykov , 2004 ) .",
    "consider multi - fluid cr - modified strong shocks .",
    "the gas heating mechanism in a cr - modified shock precursor must be specified in a simplified two - fluid approach , providing a connection between the total compression @xmath32 and the gas subshock mach number @xmath38 .",
    "it is worth to recall the plasma parameter @xmath49 is also the ratio of the thermal and magnetic pressures .",
    "the gas heating mechanism in the modified shock precursor is still under debate ( e.g. malkov and drury , 2001 ) and is usually postulated in shock modeling .",
    "there are extensive simulations of the models with _ adiabatic heating _ of the shock precursor ( e.g. kang , 2002 ) .",
    "the _ waves dissipation _ mechanism was suggested by mckenzie and vlk ( 1982 ) .",
    "the turbulent gas heating due to _ acoustic instability wave dissipation _ could be more efficient , however , if the acoustic instability develops ( e.g. malkov and drury , 2001 ) .",
    "the subshock has @xmath50 in the most of the simulated strong shocks with adiabatic heating of the precursor .",
    "the result is not too sensitive to the ion injection rate if the rate exceeds some threshold to provide the shock modification by the accelerated ions .",
    "the scaling @xmath51 was obtained by kang , ( 2002 ) .",
    "they also found that @xmath52 is a reasonably good approximation for the two - fluid time - dependent simulations of a cr - modified shock with adiabatic precursor .",
    "however , if precursor heating due to waves dissipation or the acoustic wave instability is efficient then for the plasma compression in the shock precursor could become less efficient .",
    "notice that the approximations for the shock compression and heating given above were obtained within a simplified two - fluid steady - state approach where the bohm - like diffusion model was postulated .",
    "the possibility of a shock acoustic instability development is still an open question .",
    "it requires a dedicated study of the connection between the diffusion coefficient and the local flow parameters .",
    "recent detailed numerical studies of the unsteady cr - modified shocks by kang , ( 2002 ) _ a priori _ assumed the spatial dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath53 to prevent the acoustic instability .",
    "gas heating due to acoustic instability waves or waves dissipation would change their results .",
    "a modest heating rate is expected in the case of adiabatic plasma compression in the precursor .",
    "that could be the case for very high mach number shocks @xmath54 ( i.e. @xmath55 ) where the wave dissipation is not efficient and the acoustic wave instability does not develop . the total compression ratio is @xmath56 ( e.g. blandford and eichler , 1987 ) .",
    "then the downstream ion temperature for the case of a weak upstream magnetic field ( and @xmath57 ) can be estimated from : @xmath58 here @xmath59 .",
    "the latter case of @xmath60 would require the plasma parameter @xmath61 in the shock far upstream .",
    "the scaling can be also relevant to the internal shocks of @xmath62 .",
    "following cosmological shocks simulations of ryu , ( 2003 ) the internal shocks are expected to be rather numerous in the icm .",
    "note here that the same temperature scaling @xmath63 is appropriate for strong radiative shocks ( see e.g. bouquet , 2000 ) .    under an assumption that the main heating mechanism of the gas in the precursor region is due to waves dissipation , an asymptotical estimation for the total compression of the shock @xmath64 was presented by berezhko and ellison ( 1999 ) .",
    "the estimation was obtained assuming a constant speed in the shock upstream and it is valid if @xmath65 in the far upstream flow .",
    "one may then obtain the ion temperature just behind the strong modified shock with _ the preshock heating due to wave dissipation _",
    "( bykov , 2002 ) from eq.([eq : tcr ] ) : @xmath66 the ion temperature is measured in 10@xmath67 k. eq.([eq : tia1 ] ) is valid under the conditions of @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the far upstream flow .",
    "we have @xmath70 for @xmath44= 5/3 .",
    "an important distinctive feature of the strong cr - modified shock with gas heating by wave dissipation ( given by eq.([eq : tia1 ] ) ) is the dependence of the postshock temperature on the number density and magnetic field of the incoming plasma @xmath71 .",
    "there is a remarkable difference between the single - fluid shock heating where @xmath72 for @xmath73 and that for the cr - dominated multi - fluid strong shocks ( given by eq.([eq : tia1 ] ) and eq.([eq : tia2 ] ) ) where @xmath74 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the scaling @xmath75 to describe the different cases of strong shock heating .",
    "then @xmath76 and the index @xmath77 . here",
    "the index @xmath78 approximates the velocity dependence of @xmath79 .",
    "the subshock mach number @xmath38 depends , in general , on @xmath80 and @xmath81 . for the wave heating case ( see eq.([eq : tia1 ] ) ) we have @xmath82 , the index @xmath78 is typically @xmath83 , and thus @xmath84 .",
    "in the case of high enough efficiency of the turbulent heating of gas due to the acoustic instability of a strong shock the index @xmath85 may exceed 1.5 being closer to the single - fluid limit .",
    "the shock velocity dependence of @xmath86 and @xmath87 discussed above should result in cluster thermodynamic parameter scalings @xmath0-@xmath1 and other to be confronted against observational data ( see e.g. rosati , borgani & norman 2002 for a review ) .",
    "the scaling relations depend on electron - ion relaxation and we will discuss them below .",
    "cold gas falling into the dm dominated gravitational well passes through a strong accretion shock .",
    "the shock is a source of gas entropy production in the icm ( e.g. knight & ponman , 1997 ; tozzi & norman , 2001 ; voit , 2003 ) .",
    "the post - shock entropy @xmath88 used in the icm analysis and simulations ( e.g. bialek , 2001 ) is related to the standard thermodynamic entropy @xmath89 through @xmath90 . in the standard scenario with a single - fluid accretion shock the post - shock entropy @xmath91 ( e.g. voit , 2003 ) .",
    "the multi - fluid nature of the collisionless accretion shock modifies the standard scaling relation to be @xmath92^{-(1 + \\gamma_{\\rm g})}\\cdot \\phi({\\cal m}_{\\rm sub})\\ , \\cdot \\rho_1^{(1-\\gamma_{\\rm g})}\\ ] ] the compression ratio in cr - shocks is higher than in a strong single - fluid shock of the same velocity resulting in reduced post - shock entropy production .",
    "for example , in the case of heating the post - shock entropy of a multi - fluid shock reduces as @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 . here and below in numerical estimations",
    "we assume @xmath96 though non - thermal baryonic component could reduce the index @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath97 and @xmath98 are shock velocity dependent the simple scaling @xmath99 is not valid . in cr - modified shocks",
    "@xmath100 or @xmath101 , where @xmath102 .",
    "for the case of wave heating the index @xmath103 and @xmath104 assuming @xmath105 .",
    "recently piffaretti , ( 2004 ) found that the dispersion in the observed cluster entropy profiles is smaller if an empirical relation @xmath106 is used instead of the standard @xmath107 .",
    "consider a simple model of smooth accretion of cold gas through a strong accretion shock by voit , ( 2003 ) .",
    "the gas of velocity @xmath108 accretes at a rate @xmath109 through the shock at a radius @xmath110 where @xmath111 here @xmath112 is the cluster mass and @xmath113 is the matter turnaround radius .",
    "then the entropy @xmath114 just behind the multi - fluid shock is expressed through @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in the wave heating case @xmath117 , instead of",
    "@xmath118 in the single - fluid regime .",
    "multi - fluid shock results in a slower post - shock entropy production . as we have noted above the regime of cr - shock compression depends on the plasma parameter @xmath119 in the infalling gas .",
    "the plasma parameter @xmath119 is currently poorly known because the intercluster magnetic fields are not well constrained .",
    "the effects of shock modifications are important for both the models of smooth accretion of cold gas and for accretion of hierarchical structures as well .",
    "preheating of accreting gas by different physical processes ( e.g. due to early star formation in protocluster region ) was suggested by evrard & henry ( 1991 ) , as a possible reason for the breaking of the scaling relations for pure gravitational cluster compression ( kaiser , 1986 ) .",
    "the observed high metallicity of clusters at different redshifts indicates that strong starburst activity was highly likely at some stage .",
    "the preheating produces some initial level of gas entropy ( `` entropy floor '' ) ( see e.g. extensive simulations by bialek , 2001 ; borgani , 2001 ) .",
    "multi - fluid strong shocks provide another natural way of preheating of accreting gas .",
    "we have discussed above the ion temperature and entropy production in multi - fluid shocks . however , cluster radiation spectra ( x - ray and multi - wavelength ) depend in large on the electron temperature .",
    "the electron and ion temperatures eventually equilibrate in a thick postshock layer due to coulomb collisions .",
    "the complete @xmath120 coulomb equilibration requires the system age @xmath121 , where the postshock density @xmath122 is measured in @xmath11 , the ion temperature @xmath123 is in 10@xmath67 k , and @xmath124 is in seconds ( see e.g. mewe 1990 for a review ) .",
    "the coulomb equilibration rate is fast enough to guarantee @xmath125 on the cluster scale for a hubble time .",
    "the complete @xmath120 equilibration is not always the case for a local vicinity of a collisionless shock , however . for the internal shocks in the icm",
    "the electron - ion temperature relaxation layer can be of the order of 100 - 300 kpc and it can be even larger for the external shocks .",
    "it is highly likely that the @xmath120 coulomb equilibration will be complete in the extended precursors of multi - fluid accretion shocks .",
    "waves and magnetic fluctuation pre - heat the ions to temperatures of about 0.10.5 kev in the extended shock precursor .",
    "the column depth in the precursor could be about @xmath126 providing substantial @xmath120 equilibration in the gas entering the subshock of @xmath127",
    ". then ions will be heated in the collisionless subshock by a factor of @xmath128 3.5 .",
    "the gas density and ion temperature jumps do not necessarily coincide with that of the electron temperature .",
    "x - ray telescopes can resolve in principle the extended structure with gradual electron temperature profile behind shock front . on the other hand in case of merger events it is more easy to identify the `` cold fronts ''  sharp contact discontinuities between cool gas bodies moving through a hot icm .",
    "such structures were discovered in a2142 ( markevitch , 2000 ) , a3667 ( vikhlinin , 2001 ) and other clusters .",
    "it should be noted , however , that while the coulomb collisions are unavoidable they are not the only possible electron heating process in shocks .",
    "electromagnetic field fluctuations providing the ion flow relaxation in collisionless shock may heat electrons on rather a short scale .",
    "the initial electron temperature just in the shock downstream depends on collisionless electron heating ( see e.g. cargill and papadopulos , 1988 ; bykov and uvarov , 1999 ) .",
    "non - resonant interactions of the electrons with strong nonlinear fluctuations generated by kinetic instabilities of the ions in the transition region inside the shock front may play the main role in the heating and pre - acceleration of the electrons , as it was shown in the model by bykov and uvarov ( 1999 ) .",
    "they calculated the electron energy spectrum in the vicinity of shock waves and showed that the heating and pre - acceleration of the electrons occur on a scale of the order of several hundred ion inertial lengths @xmath129 in the vicinity of a viscous discontinuity .",
    "although the electron distribution function is significantly non - equilibrium near the shock front , its low energy part can be approximated by a maxwellian distribution .",
    "the effective electron temperature just behind the front , obtained in this manner , increases with the shock wave velocity as @xmath130 with @xmath131 .",
    "they also showed that if the electron transport in the shock transition region is due to turbulent advection by strong vortex fluctuations on the ion inertial length scale ( @xmath129 ) , then the nonresonant electron heating is rather slow ( i.e. @xmath132 ) , but the electrons are still injecting into the diffusive fermi acceleration .",
    "a highly developed vortex - type turbulence is expected to exist in the transition regions of strong shocks .",
    "that would imply that the initial @xmath133 just behind the transition region would decrease with the shock velocity for @xmath41 .",

    "the multi - fluid nature of cr - modified shocks would result in @xmath155 for the cluster with relaxed @xmath120 temperatures . in the case of the shock with wave dissipation heating @xmath156 1.5 , and the @xmath5-@xmath1 scaling index",
    "is @xmath157 .",
    "the statistical analysis of a sample of about 100 observed clusters given by wu  ( 1999 ) provided the scaling @xmath158 consistent with @xmath159 .      for a virialized cluster of a total mass @xmath2 we have @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , in the model of a multi - fluid shock @xmath161 is expected . for the case of relaxed @xmath120 temperatures ( on the cluster scale ) that results in @xmath162 . here",
    "the icm gas mass @xmath163 , and @xmath164 is the baryon gas mass fraction .",
    "the index of @xmath165-@xmath1 scaling derived by mohr  ( 1999 ) from observations is 1.98 @xmath166 0.18 , consistent with the value @xmath167 2 predicted by the wave heating multi - fluid shock model ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation for a sample of galaxy clusters , groups and elliptical galaxies was studied by sanderson  ( 2003 ) .",
    "the authors reported the @xmath2-@xmath1 index 1.84 @xmath166 0.06 for the sample . to apply our simple model to a sample of the objects of different cosmological ages one has to account for the evolution of the mean density of the universe with redshift and for galaxy feedback processes ( see e.g. borgani , 2004 ) .",
    "the model @xmath3-@xmath1 scaling can be estimated from the relation @xmath168 given by wu  ( 1999 ) . here",
    "@xmath169 is the cluster core radius in spherical isothermal @xmath119-model of icm gas distribution ( of index 2/3 ) .",
    "thus , in the multi - fluid shock model we have @xmath170 . for the preshock heating by waves @xmath171 and",
    "the @xmath3-@xmath1 index is @xmath172 .",
    "we did not account here for the weak temperature dependence of the thermal bremsstrahlung gaunt - factor .",
    "arnaud & evrard ( 1999 ) obtained the @xmath3-@xmath1 index 2.88 @xmath166 0.15 from a sample of 26 clusters , while markevitch ( 1998 ) obtained 2.64 @xmath166 0.27 removing photons from central regions of the clusters .",
    "it should be noted that contrary to the @xmath5-@xmath1 and @xmath165-@xmath1 relations the @xmath3-@xmath1 relation is more sensitive to the assumed spherical symmetry and matter distribution inside the cluster .",
    "the multi - fluid processes of shock heating discussed above are a natural realization of the idea of accreting gas preheating .",
    "collisionless shocks generate energetic non - thermal particles that can penetrate far into the upstream flow .",
    "the particles decelerate the flow and preheat the gas .",
    "they can also efficiently generate fluctuating magnetic fields of @xmath173 g range on some kilo - parsecs scale .",
    "an important distinctive feature of multi - fluid shocks is their high gas compression @xmath97 that could be well above the single fluid shock limit @xmath174 . at the same time entropy production for a strong multi - fluid shock scales as @xmath175 and it is significantly reduced compared to the single - fluid shock of the same velocity .",
    "the effects are due to energetic particle acceleration and magnetic field generation .",
    "energetic particles can penetrate into the shock upstream region .",
    "they are coupled with the upstream gas through fluctuating magnetic fields ( including the waves ) .",
    "magnetic field dissipation provides gas preheating and entropy production in the shock precursor .",
    "energetic particles evacuate gas energy and momentum resulting in high gas compression and reduced temperature .",
    "such a heated pre - shock region would appear as an extended filament of a width @xmath176 cm . here",
    "@xmath177 ( in gev ) is the highest energy of the hard branch of the accelerated particle spectrum .",
    "since @xmath178 1 in the cluster outskirts and if the hard spectrum of energetic nuclei extends till @xmath179 gev ( c.f .",
    "norman , melrose & achterberg , 1995 ) we have @xmath18 100 kpc and even wider .",
    "a warm gas ( @xmath128 0.2 kev ) emission filament found with  in the outskirts of coma cluster by finoguenov ( 2003 ) could be an extended heated precursor of a strong multi - fluid accretion shock .",
    "energetic nuclei can be stored in cluster magnetic fields for hubble times ( e.g. berezinsky , blasi & ptuskin , 1997 ) .",
    "nonthermal particles and magnetic fields contribute to the total pressure of the icm .",
    "nonthermal electromagnetic emission and neutrinos due to energetic particles interactions potentially provide tests to constrain the icm nonthermal components .",
    "diffuse synchrotron radio halos were reliably detected in some clusters ( e.g. giovannini & feretti , 2000 ; carilli & taylor , 2002 ) indicating the presence of highly relativistic electrons .",
    "there are some evidences for a presence of excesses above the dominating thermal emission of the icm hot gas in both hard x - rays and euv .",
    "brunetti  ( 2004 ) argued that present observations of non - thermal radiation from clusters of galaxies can be explained even if the pressure of relativistic hadrons in the intracluster medium does not exceed 510@xmath180 of that of the thermal gas . a reliable detection or a meaningful constrain of the hard x - ray tails with _ integral _ or _ astro - e2 _ and future gamma - ray observations with _",
    "glast _ would be very important to identify the nature of the nonthermal processes in clusters .",
    "the existing upper limits for emission above 100 mev obtained with _ cgro egret _",
    "( e.g. reimer , 2003 ) can not yet rule out substantial energy density of energetic nuclei ( see also blasi , 1999 ) .",
    "a population of energetic nuclei of energy @xmath181 gev is hard to detect with current telescopes even if they have a substantial pressure comparable with that of the hot thermal gas .",
    "ultra high energy cr acceleration above 10@xmath20 gev by cosmic shocks was suggested by norman , melrose & achterberg ( 1995 ) as a plausible scenario .",
    "study of the cooling flows spectra with _",
    "rgs _ and spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy with _ epic _ aboard   ( e.g. kaastra , 2004 ) revealed significant systematic deficit of the emission of the low temperature gas as compared to the isobaric cooling flow model predictions .",
    "magnetic fields should be progressively more important in the cluster central region .",
    "while the strong multi - fluid shocks are expected to dominate at the outskirts of the cluster the hierarchical clustering model predicts moderate and weak shocks in the inner parts of the cluster as it was demonstrated by ryu , ( 2003 ) .",
    "one may also consider a magnetic field reconnection induced by cluster substructure motions . in the scenario the local energy release rate due to magnetic fields reconnection would be @xmath182 with @xmath183 2 .",
    "dissipation of the weak shocks from the reconnection events and that produced by fast moving substructures would preferentially produce energetic particles thus allowing for the non - local heating effect different from the standard heat - conduction ( bykov , 2002 ) .",
