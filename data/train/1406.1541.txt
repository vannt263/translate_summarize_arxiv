    "the cosmological constant @xmath0 was introduced by einstein in 1917 to obtain a static universe , but after the discovery of the expansion of the universe in 1929 by hubble , it was dismissed as his `` greatest blunder '' .",
    "however the idea of @xmath0 had a great comeback due to recent observational data from supernovae  @xcite , further supported by cosmic microwave background radiation data  @xcite , which suggest that the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion .",
    "moreover observational data nowadays  @xcite suggest that about 70% of the energy density of the universe is due to `` dark energy '' and the cosmological constant @xmath0 is the simplest model of dark energy and it is interpreted as vacuum energy .",
    "other more generic models consider also a dark energy which is varying in time ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is usually modeled by scalar fields with some suitable potential , which give rise to a non - linear theory .",
    "more recently also there has been proposed a link between dark energy and the recently discovered higgs particle @xcite .    despite the great success in explaining many features of observational cosmology , interpretation of the cosmological constant as vacuum energy arising from the quantum field theory (",
    "qft henceforth ) gives rise to a huge problem as its estimated value is @xmath1 times larger than what is observed .",
    "this remarkable discrepancy , often called `` the cosmological constant problem ''  @xcite , is one of the most important open problems in physics .",
    "it is commonly believed that only some hints from the quantum version of general relativity can provide us with bounds on @xmath0 explaining why it is non - negative and 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the naive qft computation .",
    "the main drawback of this point of view is that the final theory of quantum gravity is not available yet ( although there are strong candidates like string theory  @xcite and loop quantum gravity  @xcite ) .",
    "it is however also possible to obtain a bound on the value of the cosmological constant without invoking any property of the _ still - to - be - discovered _ quantum version of general relativity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed it is well known that the universe from the moment of the big bang has undergone a series of phase transitions .",
    "the last one was the transition from a quark - gluon plasma to a confined phase where matter is colorless .",
    "this phase transition occurred at an energy scale of approximately 1 gev .",
    "this means that the value of the cosmological constant can not exceed the total energy density at the moment of the last phase transition which is of 72 lower than the value obtained from qft arguments .",
    "it worth to point out that this quite simple argument to put an upper bound on the cosmological constant has , to the best knowledge of the authors never been stated in literature .",
    "moreover below the scale of 1 gev both general relativity and the skyrme model ( which is the low energy limit of quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd)@xcite ) are believed to be perfectly valid .",
    "due to these facts it is of great interest to study the properties of cosmological models where the matter field is given by the low energy limit of qcd@xcite which is phenomenologically very successfully described by the skyrme theory @xcite ( for a detailed review see @xcite ) .",
    "the skyrme model was historically a generalization of the non - linear sigma model in order to allow the existence of static soliton solutions .",
    "remarkably the skyrme soliton solutions can have excitations with fermionic degrees of freedom also if the basic involved field is bosonic .",
    "this is due to the fact that these soliton solutions can possess a non - trivial winding number .",
    "the skyrme model therefore represents a unified description of pions and baryons , where the baryon number is given by the winding of the solution .",
    "this means that this model is an effective low energy model of qcd making it one of the most important non - linear theories in nuclear and high energy physics .",
    "the skyrme theory is characterized by two coupling constants which , following the notation of  @xcite , will be denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "obviously , the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are known from experiments ; however , for the sake of the present analysis we will consider both coupling constants as parameters of the theory . since any interesting cosmological metric is time - dependent , it is necessary to use a generalized version of the typical hedgehog _",
    "ansatz _ for the skyrme field ( introduced in @xcite ) which is , at the same time , compatible with the symmetries of the cosmological backgrounds of interest and capable to keep track of the non - linear interactions of the skyrme theory .    in order to be as general as possible",
    "we couple general relativity with the skyrme theory considering two different space - time geometries : one of them is a generalization of the well known flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe , which is known as bianchi - i ( in order to allow in principle anisotropies ) , while the second is kantowski - sachs universe with a non - trivial space topology .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the skyrme field suitable for these models can be found in @xcite .",
    "the kantowski - sachs metric has a spatial topology @xmath4 .",
    "this means that it is natural to use a hedgehog _",
    "ansatz _ for the skyrme field .",
    "indeed this is the most studied _ ansatz _ for skyrmions .",
    "remarkably the equations of motion put a constraint on the existence of solutions in terms of the value of the cosmological constant and of the skyrme coupling .",
    "even if equations of motion can not be integrated an exhaustive numerical analysis shows clearly the qualitative behavior of the solutions . in order for solutions to exist not only",
    "must the cosmological constant be below a certain value that depends on the initial conditions but also the couplings of the skyrme theory must be bounded . even in the range of the cosmological and coupling constants where solutions exist many solutions present finite time future singularities . in order to avoid these singularities there",
    "arise more constraints on the permitted values of the cosmological constant which can in this case must be larger than zero .",
    "moreover the existence of solutions without finite time future singularities also constrain the value of the skyrme couplings .",
    "the bianchi - i space - time has topology @xmath5 and so the hedgehog _ ansatz _ can not be directly used .",
    "there exits however a generalization of this _ ansatz _ as done in @xcite .",
    "remarkably also in bianchi - i , even if with some different details , in order for solutions to exist and at the same time to avoid finite time future singularities , one needs to put constraints on the cosmological constant which must be in this case non - negative and smaller than a critical value .",
    "also in this case constraints on the skyrme couplings arise .",
    "the only assumption that we will use in the present analysis is to require the existence of solutions which are free of finite - time future singularities ( ftfs henceforth ) .",
    "skyrme - induced ftfs can occur only around 1 gev energy scale when the corresponding gravitational effects are strongest . since the universe exists in its current form ( at a much lower energy scale )",
    "we argue that skyrme - induced ftfs never occured .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in the second section the skyrme action is introduced , while in the third section the hedgehog _",
    "ansatz _ is described .",
    "then the cosmological dynamics of both the kantowski - sachs and bianchi - i universes are analyzed .",
    "finally we draw the conclusions .",
    "the skyrme model is one of the most famous examples of non - linear field theories as it provides a unified description of pions and nucleons .",
    "this is due to the fact that even if the field is bosonic there exist soliton solutions with non - trivial winding number which possess fermionic excitations .",
    "the winding number is indeed interpreted as baryonic number ( see e.g. for a review  @xcite ) .",
    "the skyrme action can be constructed in the following way : let be @xmath6 a @xmath7 valued scalar field .",
    "we can the define the quantities : @xmath8 @xmath9.\\ ] ] here the latin indices correspond to the group indices and the generators @xmath10 of @xmath7 are related to the pauli matrices by @xmath11 .",
    "the skyrme action is then defined as @xmath12 the case when @xmath13 is called non linear sigma model and the term which multiplies @xmath3 is called the skyrme term . historically the skyrme term was introduced due to the fact that the non linear sigma model does not admit static soliton solutions . the total action for a self gravitating skyrme field reads @xmath14",
    "the @xmath7 valued scalar field can be parametrized in a standard way @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 must satisfy @xmath18.[uparametrization ] the most famous and most studied _ ansatz _ for searching solutions to the ( non - self gravitating ) skyrme theory is the so called `` hedgehog '' which is obtained by choosing @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a radial profile function and @xmath21 is a normal radial vector @xmath22 it is worth to stress that the hedgehog _ ansatz _ mixes inner degrees with space degrees of freedom as the `` normal vector '' @xmath21 lives in the inner space but is parametrized by space indices .",
    "in other words at every space point the vector @xmath21 point radially in the inner space .",
    "ansatz _ which has been studied exhaustively in flat space - time can also be used in curved space - times with spherical symmetry @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are metric and coordinates of a two dimensional lorentzian manifold , @xmath26 is a warp function and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the metric and coordinates on the two sphere @xmath29 . in this case the hedgehog _ ansatz _",
    "remains the same and in general the profile function @xmath30 is a function of both coordinates of the two dimensional lorentzian manifold .",
    "the stress tensor of the skyrme field for ( [ hedgehog])([sphericalmetric ] ) then be written as @xmath31dy^ady^b -\\frac{1}{2}k\\(\\partial_c \\alpha \\partial^c \\alpha-\\lambda r^{-4}\\sin ^4 \\alpha\\)r^2\\gamma_{ab}dz^adz^b . \\end{array}\\label{hedgehogtmunu}\\ ] ]",
    "in the context of cosmology , in order to use the hedgehog _ ansatz _ it is necessary to have a two dimensional sphere as a sub - manifold .",
    "therefore the natural choice is the kantowski - sachs metric .",
    "the kantoski - sachs space - time describes a homogeneous but not isotropic universe and has a topology @xmath4 .",
    "this space - time is very remarkable because it describes the only homogeneous cosmology which is not included in the bianchi classification .",
    "this is due to the fact that it does not have a three dimensional isometry subgroup which is simply transitive .",
    "the metric can be written as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two functions which are determined by the einstein field equations .",

    "we study behavior of the model with just skyrme term as a source , i.e. described by ( [ skyrme])([et ] ) .",

    "areas with different sign of @xmath20 at future singularity are separated by unstable trajectories presented in fig . [",

    "-term as a source .",
    "notations are the same as in fig .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) have slightly different initial conditions and demonstrate that final value for @xmath20 is no longer quantized compared to skyrme case ( see text for details).,scaledwidth=67.0% ]    in this section we added @xmath0-term as an additional source to the system under consideration ; the equations ( [ skyrme])([et ] ) are modified in a similar way as they modified in standard cosmology when one adds @xmath0-term .",
    "the behavior changes drastically in presence of nonzero positive @xmath0-term and typical is shown in fig .",
    "the main difference is that we no longer have finite - time future singularity regardless of the initial conditions .",
    "the other difference is that the value for @xmath20 at infinity is no longer quantized compared to the `` pure '' skyrme case .",
    "the explanation for this we see as follows : with the skyrme being ordinary matter , its energy density , no matter now high it was , is eventually decreasing with the expansion whilst @xmath0-term energy - density remains constant . at some point the skyrme contribution becomes subdominant and the expansion dominated by skyrme changes to de sitter phase .",
    "soon after the value for the skyrme field @xmath20 `` freezes '' near its current value which could be any  we demonstrated it in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "there are two cases when in presence of nonzero @xmath0-term we still have finite - time future singularity .",
    "first of them is when @xmath0-term is negative  in that case we always have finite - time future singularity .",
    "the second case is when @xmath0-term is positive , but its value is low enough for future singularity to occurs before @xmath0-term becomes dominant ; this case is represented in fig .",
    "there we presented @xmath57 curves for for two branches for initial value of @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , 00-component of einstein equation    @xmath59 = \\dac{\\dot b^2 + 1}{b^2 } + 2h_a \\dac{\\dot b}{b } - \\lambda , \\end{array}\\label{00}\\ ] ]    being solved with respect to @xmath60 , leads to two branches depending on the sign ( `` + '' or ``  '' ) for @xmath58 .",
    "so in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for these two branches we plot the value for @xmath61 so that if for @xmath62 we always have isotropisation and for @xmath63 we always have finite - time future singularity for a given set of initial conditions ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ) and given value for @xmath2 . despite the fact that actual values for @xmath57 depend on initial conditions and @xmath2 , general behavior remains the same with one exemption .",
    "this case is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a shaded region .",
    "and this region corresponds to `` forbidden '' region of @xmath68 values .",
    "indeed , if one solves ( [ 00 ] ) with @xmath69 with respect to , say , @xmath0 , one would get    , @xmath0 ) space which lead to isotropisation ( @xmath62 ) or to finite - time future singularity ( @xmath63 ) ; supscript `` @xmath70 '' corresponds to positive or negative branch of @xmath58 as solved from ( [ 00 ] ) ; shaded region depicts `` forbidden '' region of ( @xmath3 , @xmath0 ) combinations ( see text for details ) .",
    "panel ( a ) presents `` large - scale '' picture with the entire allowed region in the first quadrant depicted while ( b ) panel focuses on the smaller region with detailed @xmath61 curves .",
    "numerical values for @xmath0 and @xmath3 are subject to the initial conditions .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    @xmath71    one can see that @xmath72 always while @xmath73 potentially could have both signs ; in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] initial conditions correspond to @xmath74 .",
    "one can also easily check that for @xmath75 the value for @xmath76 from ( [ 00 ] ) becomes negative which means that one can not choose @xmath75 . in conclusion : for any @xmath77 there exists @xmath78 defined from ( [ lambda0 ] ) so that @xmath75 are forbidden from energy budget . and @xmath79 is defined from ( [ lambda0 ] ) where the line crosses @xmath80  it would be @xmath81 in terms of ( [ lambda0 ] ) .",
    "so for @xmath82 we must have @xmath83 in order for any solution to exist ; needless to say , in that case we always have finite - time future singularity .",
    "one can also see that @xmath84  indeed , in order for @xmath73 to diverge one needs either diverge one of the terms in numerator ( so to diverge @xmath48 , @xmath46 , or @xmath47 which means divergence of @xmath85 and so physical singularity ) or put denominator to zero  so that to put @xmath86 which also means singularity . so that in all regular points @xmath73 is finite and",
    "so limit on @xmath0 is also finte .",
    "we mentioned that @xmath73 could be negative  in that case the interception of the @xmath87 with @xmath88 would occur at negative values of @xmath0 making _ all _ possible values for both @xmath0 and @xmath3 lead to finite - time future singularity . that happens if @xmath89 which is defined from @xmath90 from  ( [ lambda0 ] ) :    @xmath91      one can see several differences between the regimes with no finite - time future singularity with and without @xmath0-term .",
    "first is the abundance of the regime  in pure skyrme case this regime is unstable and has zeroth measure on the initial conditions space whilst in @xmath0-case it has nonzero measure .",
    "the second difference is the `` final '' value for @xmath20  in pure skyrme case it is quantized whilst in the @xmath0-case it can take any value .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that in pure skyrme term the dynamics is driven by the skyrme `` till the end '' , while in the @xmath0-case the cosmological term eventually ( if @xmath92 ) become dominant resulting in changing the dynamics to de sitter stage .",
    "when it happenes , the value for the skyrme `` freezes '' and it can happen at any value .    and the last , but not least difference we would like to point an attention to , is the dinamical behavior of the metric functions .",
    "one can see that in the skyrme case @xmath48 quickly reaches near - zero value and remains there , whilst @xmath51 ( it has the same dimensionality as @xmath48 ) remains positive and slowly decreasing . on the other hand , in the @xmath0-case we have @xmath93 at late stages , which is typical for @xmath0-dominated cosmologies .",
    "so very carefully we can say that in the @xmath0-case the universe isotropize in the de sitter sense , i.e. in the de sitter sense the hubble parameter plays a role of exponent for exponential de sitter expansion so when these exponents coinside for anisotropic model , they call it isotropic .",
    "but formally one can not `` isotropize '' this model  topologically kantowski - sacks represented by @xmath94 which is anisotropic by its topology and under no dynamics it can not turn into , say , @xmath95 which could be formally isotropize .",
    "it will not hurt adding that , as it was already mentioned , the @xmath36 part has no spatial curvature and so the associated scale factor has no physical meaning , and , keeping in mind that formally isotropisation is the situation when all relevant scale factors are equal , this way of isotropisation determination can not be applied to the model under consideration .",
    "we discovered that there exist critical values for all three parameters of the system ",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "first of all , there exists line @xmath87 , defined by ( [ lambda0 ] ) , which separates allowed ( @xmath96 ) and forbidden ( @xmath75 ) regions on the @xmath68 space .",
    "if @xmath74 which happening if @xmath97 defined from ( [ kcr ] ) , then inside the allowed region in the first quadrant there exist @xmath61 lines ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) which separates regions which leads to isotropisation ( @xmath98 ) from regions with finite - time future singularity ( @xmath99 ) . allowed region in first quadrant",
    "is bounded by @xmath81 in terms of ( [ lambda0 ] ) ; so that for @xmath82 we always need @xmath83 in order to have any solution , and these solution always have finite - time future singularity .",
    "the same  necessity of @xmath83 and finite - time future singularity  is true if we have @xmath100 and so @xmath89 .",
    "so to summarize the predicament for having isotropisarion in this model ( given that otherwise we have finite - time future singularity , isotropisation seems much more physical if we want to consider the model ) : we need @xmath101 , @xmath77 and @xmath97 .",
    "so that in this particular model just assumption of the physical behavior allows us to put constraints on the coupling constants and @xmath0 .",
    "let us note that if we `` turn off '' skyrme term ( by putting @xmath102 ) with nonlinear sigma model still intact ( @xmath103 ) the constrain on @xmath3 is obviously lifted but constraint on @xmath2 remains ; in that case the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is replaced with dependence on @xmath2 like in bianchi - i case ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) . from ( [ lambda0 ] )",
    "one can see that @xmath78 depends on both @xmath3 and @xmath2 linearly and fig [ fig3 ] is @xmath104 slice while fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] could be considered as a reference to @xmath105 slice .",
    "we summarized all possible regimes in table [ table_ks ] .",
    "[ table_ks ]    .summary of the regimes in kantowski - sachs skyrme cosmology [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it worth mentioning that if we add other matter sources , situation with bounding @xmath0-term only improves in the sense that constraints becomes tighter .",
    "indeed , upper bound originates from the total energy density and in case of two components  skyrme and @xmath0-term , one can say that `` all what is not skyrme is @xmath0-term '' ; but if there are other components , @xmath0 is bounded by `` new '' energy budget with all components taken into account .",
    "lower bound on @xmath0 just scales with upper bound and unlikely to be highly affected by additional sources  if they are isotropic , they `` help '' isotropize model in the similar way @xmath0-term do .",
    "needless to say that the same is true for kantowski - sachs model as well .",
    "we have studied the cosmological dynamics for the skyrme matter field for two anisotropic cosmologies namely kantowski - sachs and bianchi - i . to the bests of authors knowledge",
    "this is the first detailed analysis of the cosmological consequences of gravitating skyrme matter . due to the high nonlinearity of the equations of motion",
    "it is not possible to find simple analytic solutions .",
    "the basic features of the cosmological dynamics can however be studied performing a numerical analysis . despite the fact that these two cosmologies are topologically very different they share several basic common features . indeed in order for solutions to exist and to be free of finite time future singularities bounds must be set on the value of the cosmological constant and also on the skyrme couplings .    in order to get a physically sensible scenario the cosmological constant must be strictly positive ( i.e. non - zero ) .",
    "the upper bound on the cosmological constant has a physical interpretation in terms of the phase transition from quark - gluon plasma to a confined ( colorless ) theory .",
    "indeed there are physical fields whose cosmological evolution begin below the energy scale of 1 gev since they only appear as low energy degrees of freedom of qcd after the confinement phase transition .",
    "hence , the initial data for these fields must be set when the total energy density is of that order .",
    "then , upper and lower bounds on @xmath0 naturally appear , as it has been explained before , when the einstein equations are solved ( numerically ) .",
    "thus , the key point is just to identify a set of physical fields which appear as source terms in einstein equations late enough to make the upper bound on @xmath0 as tight as possible . within the standard model of particle physics , the `` latest '' fields to come into play",
    "are baryons and pions and so we have used the skyrme model ( altough a description in terms of an effective perfect fluid would work as well , as long as the initial conditions are set at the gev scale ) .",
    "even if this physical interpretation is very natural and rather simple curiosly it has never been mentioned in literature .",
    "this analysis actually may offers a change of paradigm on the problem to find bounds on @xmath0 since , unlike what is usually expected , the tightest bounds arise from the lowest energy hadronic particles .",
    "it is also apparent that a perturbative treatment is unsuitable since the bounds depend in a non - analytic way on the skyrme coupling .",
    "the same procedure could be repeated for the phase transitions ( such as the ones predicted in grand unified theories ) prior to the one considered in present paper  in that case we would have qualitatively the same behavior but with higher upper bounds on @xmath0 . in order for the universe to enter a new phase dominated by some lower - energy matter fields one must ensure the absence of ftfs and existence of solutions in previous phase .",
    "the energy scale considered in this paper corresponds to the last step in the hierarhy of bounds on @xmath0 so that if the upper bound on @xmath0 is not satisfied then the confinement phase transition would not had even occured .",
    "once the value of the cosmological constant has been fixed by the initial conditions also bounds on the skyrme couplings appear .",
    "these bounds are related to the peculiar structure of the skyrme action .",
    "this can be seen by the fact that similar bounds on the couplings arise for both cosmological models .",
    "this suggests that this behavior is intrinsic to the coupling of the skyrme field to general relativity rather than some specific cosmological _",
    "ansatz_.        ( in bianchi - i case @xmath107 ) ; that way @xmath108 and @xmath79 are intersections of the resulting plane with @xmath2 and @xmath3 axis . this way the resulting classification of regimes ( tables [ table_ks ] and [ table_bi ] ) is obtained for fixed @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfing @xmath77 and @xmath97 .",
    "if one perfroms a perturbative analysis in the initial data starting from a cosmological solution of the einstein equation and turns on `` slowly '' the skyrme couplings then the most interesting bounds we found would be lost ( since they are not analytic in the skyrme couplings ) . as an alternative , one could perfrom a perturbative analysis in the initial data starting from a time - dependent solution of the skyrme field equations turning on `` slowly '' the newton constant .",
    "this alternative approach is complicated by the lack of suitable exact time - dependent solutions of the skyrme field equations .",
    "we leave these two points for a future investigation .",
