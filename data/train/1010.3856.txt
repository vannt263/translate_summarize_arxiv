    "sigma ( @xmath9 ) phase has a tetragonal unit cell ( type d@xmath10 p@xmath112/mnm ) hosting 30 atoms distributed over five crystallographically non - equivalent sites . due to high coordination numbers",
    "( 12 - 15 ) the @xmath9-phase is a member of the frank - kasper family of phases .",
    "the importance of this class of structures is reinforced by the fact that they exhibit topological properties similar to simple metallic glasses due to an icosahedral local arrangement .",
    "consequently , they can also be regarded as very good approximants for dodecagonal quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0phase has been revealed to occur only in such alloy systems in which at least one element is a transition metal .    concerning the existence of the sigma - phase in binary alloys , about 50 examples were found so far @xcite .",
    "its physical properties are characteristic of a given alloy , a high hardness and brittleness being a common feature . in the family of the binary alloy sigma - phases only two viz .",
    "fe - cr and fe - v have well - evidenced magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "in particular , the magnetic properties of @xmath0phase strongly depend on composition . in the fe@xmath12cr@xmath13 system , where the @xmath0phase exist in a narrow range of @xmath14 , the curie temperature varies between 0 k ( for @xmath15 ) and",
    "38 k ( for @xmath16 ) @xcite . in the fe - v system , where the range of the @xmath9-phase occurrence is about six - fold wider",
    ", the effect of the composition is even stronger .",
    "another common characteristics is a lack of stoichiometry , a feature that in combination with the complex crystallographic structure , makes the @xmath9-phase a very challenging object both for theoretical investigations and interpretation of experimental data . on the other hand",
    ", the lack of stoichiometry may also have some advantage viz .",
    "the @xmath9-phase can be formed in a certain range of composition , giving thereby a chance for studying the influence of content on its properties , hence a possibility of tailoring these properties .",
    "for example , a magnetism of the @xmath9-phase in fe@xmath12v@xmath13 alloys is strongly dependent on the composition , and , in particular , the curie temperature may vary between 0 k ( for @xmath17 ) and 320 k ( for @xmath18 ) @xcite . the complex structure and",
    "the chemical disorder ( all five sites are occupied by various atoms ) result in a huge number of possible atomic configurations which makes an interpretation of measurements performed by using microscopic methods e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance or mssbauer spectroscopy to be a difficult and often non - unique task . in these circumstances , theoretical calculations ,",
    "as these presented elsewhere @xcite , can be very helpful as they not only provide a deeper insight into the underlying physics but they also offer a very useful support for a correct interpretation of experimental data .    this paper reports theoretical calculations on the magnetic properties of the @xmath0fecr system which is regarded as the archetype of all @xmath0 phases .",
    "its magnetic properties were recently intensively investigated @xcite , and , in particular , the average magnetic moment per fe atom was determined from magnetization measurements assuming only fe atoms having parallel moments contribute . however , the knowledge is not complete yet , as it is unknown whether or not both types of atoms ( fe and cr ) are magnetic , and if so , what are the values of their magnetic moments on particular sublattices and what is their mutual orientation .",
    "these questions can not be answered experimentally because one can not grow big enough single - crystals of the sigma for a decisive neutron diffraction experiment .",
    "hence , the situation prompts and justifies further relevant theoretical calculations .",
    "the ones reported in this paper are in the line with this aim .",
    "atoms belonging to various crystallographic positions are indicated by different fillings .",
    "nn atoms of each of five lattice sites are indicated also . ]",
    "as aforementioned , the @xmath9-phase has complex close - packed tetragonal structure with thirty atoms in the unit cell ( fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "atoms are distributed over five non - equivalent sites in the unit cell , called a , b , c , d and e , the population of them is shown in table  [ table0 ] .",
    "each position can be characterized by the total number of nearest neighbors , nn , their distribution over five sublattices , the distances to nn atoms as well as the occupancy by fe or cr atoms .",
    "some properties can be derived directly from the space group information .",
    "each atom in the @xmath9-phase structure has a high coordination number ( from 12 to 15 atoms ) , belonging to various sites ( table  [ table0 ] ) .",
    "their average inter - atomic distances substantially differ and are in the range from @xmath19(the smallest e ",
    "e distance ) to @xmath20(the largest b  e distance ) .",
    "interestingly , the nn spatial distribution is not far from spherical for each site ( fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .    electronic structure calculations for @xmath0fecr compounds",
    "have been performed using the charge and spin self - consistent korringa - kohn - rostoker method .",
    "the crystal potential of the muffin - tin form has been constructed within the local density approximation ( lda ) framework , applying the von barth - hedin formula @xcite for the exchange - correlation part . with",
    "the self - consistent crystal potentials converged up to 0.1 mry and charges up to @xmath21 , total , site - decomposed and @xmath22-decomposed ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) density of states ( dos ) have been computed on a 601 energy point mesh for ordered models , employing the tetrahedron * k*-space integration technique ( dividing the irreducible part of the brillouin zone into  120 small tetrahedrons ) .    in the first stage ,",
    "the electronic structure calculations have been done for ordered approximants of the @xmath0fecr alloys , and for that purpose we lowered the symmetry of the unit cell ( space group p@xmath26/mnm ) to a simple tetragonal one . in practice , the tetragonal unit cell and atomic positions were unchanged but variable occupancy made all 30 atomic positions crystallographically nonequivalent .",
    "in such a specified unit cell each of the crystallographic positions was occupied exclusively either by fe or cr atom .",
    "however , in our numerical runs we were constrained by the experimentally determined fe / cr concentrations on each of the five lattice sites @xcite and the composition of the @xmath0fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 , being close to the measured stoichiometry ( fe@xmath6cr@xmath7 ) , has been considered .",
    "it should be noticed that the composition of the alloy is given in two equivalent notations . when the unit cell of the @xmath9-phase is referred to calculations",
    ", we use the fe@xmath27cr@xmath13 formula , since @xmath28 must be the whole number here .",
    "conversely , the fe@xmath12cr@xmath13 formula is related to those cases , when @xmath28 ( the cr concentration ) in the sample was obtained experimentally .",
    ".[table0 ] atomic crystallographic positions and numbers of the nearest neighbor atoms , nn , for the five lattice sites of the @xmath9-phase . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as can be seen from table  [ table3 ] the ordering of the magnetic moments in this case is possible only on positions 8i ( c and d sites ) and 8j ( e sites ) . the results of our calculations are given below :    site 8i : + @xmath29    site 8j : + @xmath30 + @xmath31    where the numbering of the atomic positions is given according to the international tables for x - ray crystallography @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is free ( both in magnitude and in sign ) what means that the symmetry analysis is not able to predict differences neither in values nor in relative ordering of the magnetic moments between different sublattices . due to this freedom different models of possible magnetic orderings",
    "may be considered . however",
    ", the calculations clearly show that the arrangements of the magnetic moments within 8@xmath33 and 8@xmath34 sublattices are antiferromagnetic with strictly given sequences , and , additionally , at 8@xmath34 site the structure is noncollinear ( 4 magnetic moments aligned antiparallel in the basic plane along the diagonal and 4 other ones also antiparallel but perpendicular to the previous moments ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the purely antiferromagnetic state suggested by the aforementioned symmetry analysis is possible when atomic positions are occupied by given types of atoms with the same probability .",
    "this type of the lattice occupation is broken in the case of a fe / cr disordered alloy , and the proposed magnetic structures can be treated as initial conditions for the electronic structure calculations .",
    "this is the reason why , one of the considered model of the magnetic structure , has been called apm , instead of antiferromagnetic one .      the kkr calculations using the apm model were performed assuming the input crystal potentials obtained for the fm state .",
    "the computations started with initial spin - polarized potentials , but this fact had no effect on the finally converged apm results .",
    "such procedure allowed us to substantially accelerate the self - consistent convergence . according to the apm model , antiferromagnetic ordering",
    "was assumed on the sublattices c and d. the symmetry analysis does not provide any information about the relative magnetic moments sequences .",
    "these sequences can be known within each sublattice separately .",
    "consequently , two separate magnetic structures should be considered with the following relative sublattice settings : c ( @xmath35 ) and d ( @xmath35 ) as well as c ( @xmath35 ) and d ( @xmath36 ) , which led us to different values of the magnetic moments . since",
    "only collinear arrangement was allowed in the kkr calculations , antiparallel coupling of the magnetic moments on e site was not taken into account .    as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the assumed apm model for the fe / cr magnetic moment arrangement has converged to a stable magnetic configuration with atomic moments of the opposite polarization , which can be especially well seen in the case of fe atoms located on sublattices c and d ( and also to some extent on sublattice e ) .",
    "furthermore , the apm model computations have generated intermediate fe magnetic moments with a different alignment , particularly on sublattices a and e , which were not observed for the fm ordering .",
    "there was not revealed any visible change on the sublattice b with respect to fm .",
    "the changes of the magnetic moments of cr atoms on all sublattices have been found similar to the fe ones .",
    "the smallest effect has been observed on the sublattice e.    in the case of apm model , the total magnetic moment as determined by averaging the moments of individual atoms yielded @xmath37 , with negligible contribution ( c.a .",
    "@xmath38 ) from the outside muffin - tin volume , which ultimately gives @xmath39 ( table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "this value is significantly smaller than that obtained with the fm model ( @xmath40 ) , and much closer to the experimental value ( @xmath41 ) @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the apm - ordering may be responsible for the small value of the magnetic moment deduced from the magnetization measurements .",
    "a spatial distribution of the magnetic moments in the @xmath0phase unit cell found with the apm model shows a behavior similar to that detected with the fm model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) . in this case",
    ", however , the projected areas of the magnetic moments with the same orientation are markedly smaller .",
    "fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 alloy obtained with the fm ( blue , dashed ) and apm ( black , solid ) models , as calculated by the kkr - cpa method . ]    bearing in mind the aforementioned kkr results both in the fm and the apm ground states , we have also studied the effect of a chemical disorder on electronic structure and magnetic properties of the @xmath0fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 alloy using the kkr - cpa method .    in this case ,",
    "the disorder ( treated as random ) was introduced on three sublattices ( b : fe@xmath42cr@xmath43 , c : fe@xmath42cr@xmath43 and e : fe@xmath44cr@xmath45 ) , where the disorder is the most significant as follows from the neutron diffraction experiment ( see table  [ table1 ] ) . due to the highly time - consuming calculations ,",
    "the sublattices a and d were left fully occupied by fe atoms .",
    "this modification required to slightly decrease the fe concentration on other sublattices , in order to maintain the fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 stoichiometry for the direct comparison between the kkr and the kkr - cpa results .",
    "the kkr - cpa results are discussed here for the fm and the apm models , neglecting the non - spin polarized computations .",
    "the total doss computed for the @xmath0fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 ( fig .  [ fig_tdos ] ) are quite similar in both cases . however , there are few subtle differences between the two presented dos spectra . in the fm state ,",
    "the dos is more spin polarized ( up - dos and down - dos are slightly shifted into lower and higher energy range , respectively ) as well as two down - dos peaks are more pronounced .",
    "this feature yields the total magnetic moment as large as @xmath46 ( @xmath47 per unit cell ) against only @xmath48 ( @xmath49 per unit cell ) in the apm state ( table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the dos at e@xmath50 in the apm state is a bit smaller than that in the fm one , which may tentatively support a better stability of the apm state , relative to the fm one . before inspecting in more detail the local origin of the magnetism in the disordered @xmath0fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 alloy ,",
    "let us remark that disorder effects markedly decrease the magnetic moments on fe atoms on all sublattices , and , in consequence , the total magnetization per unit cell .",
    "this feature is well seen for the fm state , where the value of 0.4@xmath4 was calculated with kkr - cpa for the total magnetization , compared to almost 0.6@xmath4 with kkr as obtained via averaging over a set of results obtained for the ordered approximant approach .",
    "quite similar behavior was found for the apm state , since the magnetization values gained from the kkr - cpa and the kkr methods also differ ( 0.15@xmath4 for disordered alloy against 0.20 @xmath4 for ordered models of the @xmath0fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 ) .",
    "hence , an inclusion of the chemical disorder into the electronic structure calculations has additionally lowered the total magnetization by about 25% .",
    "fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 alloy as obtained with the apm model .",
    "]    the choice of the apm magnetic structure for the kkr - cpa calculations has resulted in the total magnetic moment ( 0.15  @xmath4 ) in an excellent agreement with the experimental data ( 0.14  @xmath4 ) for the @xmath0fe@xmath6cr@xmath7 alloy .",
    "it should be added that in the apm model , according to the symmetry analysis , sites c and d with multiplicity 8 were split into two `` sub - sites '' , each with multiplicity 4 , having an antiparallel orientation .",
    "consequently , in order to distinguish the magnetic moments and doss of fe atoms on d site and those of fe / cr atoms on c site that are arranged parallel or antiparallel to other sites , ( a , b and e ) , we have introduced indexes @xmath51 and @xmath25 , respectively .    inspecting the fe doss on all sites in the apm state ( fig .",
    "[ fig_dosabc ] ) , one can notice two sites ( b and c ) with strongly polarized electronic spectrum , giving rise to large local magnetic moments of + 2.08  @xmath4 ( b site ) as well as of -2.06 @xmath4 ( fe@xmath52 ) and of + 2.11 @xmath4 ( fe@xmath53 ) on c site . the spin polarization of dos on other sites remains much smaller , resulting in relatively lower values of fe magnetic moments on a ( + 0.32  @xmath4 ) , d ( -0.44 on fe@xmath52 and + 0.65  @xmath4 on fe@xmath53 ) and e ( + 0.90  @xmath4 ) .",
    "the kkr - cpa results well reflect the aforementioned correlation ( sec .",
    "iii b ) between the values of the fe magnetic moment and the average distance to nn atoms , well supporting the kkr findings for the ordered approximants .",
    "it is worth noticing that on these sites , where cr atoms were substituted ( b , c and e ) , a small cr magnetic moment was found to be always aligned antiparallel to the fe magnetic moment on the same site .",
    "such electronic structure behavior was also found for the fm state using the kkr - cpa method . as already mentioned ,",
    "the polarization of the cr dos is weak and for e site a slight dos asymmetry for two spin directions yielded the magnetic moment of about -0.20  @xmath4 . in the case of b and c sites , the calculated cr magnetic moment is as small as -0.10  @xmath4 , on average .    at present",
    ", we must rely on the above described interpretation of the magnetic ordering in the @xmath0fecr system , since first the apm structure appears the simplest one and second there are no available experimental evidences indicating more complex ( e.g. noncollinear ) magnetic structure .",
    "the results of the electronic structure calculations using kkr and kkr - cpa methods reported in the present study can be summarized . both fe and cr atoms in the @xmath0fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 alloy are magnetic .",
    "magnetic moments of fe atoms for each lattice site linearly increase with the number of fe atoms in the nearest - neighbor shell , nn@xmath54 , whereas cr atoms are coupled antiparallel with respect to fe atoms ( values of the magnetic moments for both fe and cr atoms are characteristic of a given lattice site ) .",
    "ferromagnetic ordering of the fe - site magnetic moments accounted for the calculations results in a significant overestimation of the magnetism in the investigated sample .",
    "fortunately , admission of an anti - parallel ordering on some selected sites , suggested by the symmetry analysis , in a combination with a partial chemical disorder yields the excellent agreement with the experimentally found value of the average magnetic moment per atom ."
