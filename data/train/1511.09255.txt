    "the surface of the flowing layer maintains a dynamic angle of repose @xmath1 with respect to horizontal that depends on the frictional properties , the diameter @xmath2 of the particles , and the rotational speed of the tumbler @xcite . in experiments with",
    "spherical tumblers approximately half filled with a 50%-50% size bidisperse mixture of particles and with smooth walls , large particles accumulate near the poles of the tumbler with a band of small particles at the equator @xcite .",
    "this pattern is inverted for lower fill fractions so that small particles accumulate near the poles with a band of large particles at the equator @xcite .",
    "we note that multiple bands of small and large particles occur for bidisperse mixtures in long rotating cylindrical tumblers , which are used in applications for materials ranging from foodstuffs to mining to cement , typically after o(10 ) to o(100 ) rotations and having a wavelength of about one tumbler diameter @xcite under a wide range of conditions @xcite . in the cylindrical tumbler case , however , large particles segregate near the flat end walls of the tumbler @xcite , as a consequence of radial segregation combined with the nonuniform axial distribution of velocity in the flowing layer due to friction at the endwall @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can not occur in the spherical tumblers studied here .",
    "although dem simulations of spherical tumblers with smooth walls readily reproduce the segregation experiments in an acrylic spherical tumbler @xcite , the mechanism for the inversion of the segregation bands from large - small - large ( lsl ) for higher fill fractions to small - large - small ( sls ) at lower fill fractions remains unresolved . in an initial effort to understand the segregation mechanism",

    "however , this is to be expected because the time that particles spend in the flowing layer depends directly on the fill fraction . for low fill fractions , particles pass through the flowing layer more frequently than at high fill fractions for the same elapsed time @xcite .",
    "since only particles in the flowing layer have the opportunity to rearrange themselves ( unlike particles below the flowing layer , which are locked into place in the bed of particles in solid body rotation ) , one could reasonably expect the segregation pattern to appear more quickly for low fill fractions than for high fill fractions .",

    "previous results for the effect of wall roughness and fill level on particle trajectories in monodisperse flows provide some insights .",
    "the trajectories in the flowing layer for both smooth and rough walls are curved @xcite .",
    "this curvature is negligible at the equator ( at @xmath38  cm , which is a line of symmetry ) and increases moving toward the pole . for particles near the surface of the flowing layer ,",
    "the trajectory curvature for smooth walls is greater than that for rough walls .",
    "however , the net poleward drift at the surface with each pass through the flowing layer for rough walls is larger than for smooth walls . since surface particles drift poleward , particles deeper in the flowing layer drift toward the equator to conserve mass .",
    "as the fill level is reduced , the curvature of the particle trajectories increases for all roughnesses , and the poleward drift decreases only for smooth walls but does not change significantly for rough walls .",
    "these monodisperse results can be used to explain the bidisperse segregation patterns .",
    "two effects compete to select the segregation pattern .",
    "first , particles are subject to a depth dependent poleward drift .",
    "since drift is larger at the surface @xcite , large particles that have segregated to the surface axially drift further poleward than small particles below the surface .",
    "large particles remain at the surface due to radial segregation , so they accumulate near the poles .",
    "small particles below the surface in the radially segregated core are transported by the global convection cells : from equator to pole nearer the surface and from pole to equator deeper in the flowing layer @xcite . the second effect , which counteracts the drift , is the high curvature of the particle trajectories at the surface of the flowing layer , which is typical of smooth walls @xcite .",
    "it results in both small and large particles being carried further poleward in the upstream portion of the flowing layer .",
    "small particles tend to fall out of the flowing layer sooner than larger particles due to percolation , thus depositing in the fixed bed when they are closer to the poleward extrema of the trajectory than large particles , which tend to stay near the surface to curve back more toward the equator to deposit at an axial position near where they started .",
    "it is likely that for smooth walls , this trajectory curvature effect dominates , leading to the sls pattern ; for rough walls , where the trajectory curvature is smaller , the drift is very efficient and dominates @xcite leading to the lsl pattern .    to confirm this mechanism , we plot pairs of trajectories for the two species of particles ( 2 and 4  mm ) starting from the same initial positions in the flowing zone near the surface ( specifically , when the center of a particle starts within a sphere of radius 1  mm that is 3  mm below the free surface ) , for tumblers with smooth or with 2  mm rough walls in figs .",
    "[ comparetraj30ptop ] and [ comparetraj30pside ] .",
    "these trajectories are obtained by averaging thousands of individual particle trajectories starting from the same initial coordinate during the first few seconds ( between @xmath48  s and @xmath49  s ) of the flow , before radial segregation is achieved . like the monodisperse case @xcite , the trajectories in a tumbler with a smooth wall have a larger curvature than those for the rough case ( fig .",

    "[ comparetraj30ptop](a ) ) .",

    "[ ios0 - 2 mm ] where the segregation indices in all cases are negative during the few first seconds , even in the cases of asymptotic lsl segregated systems .",
    "it is also evident that fully developed segregation is reached more quickly for sls than for lsl ( also observed experimentally @xcite ) .    on the other hand , for rough walls , the curvature of the trajectories is less , but the net drift of both particles is toward the pole . due to the radial segregation ,",
    "large particles stay at the surface , whereas small particles are deeper in the flowing layer where there is a return flow toward the equator .",
    "the drift effect tends toward an lsl segregation pattern and dominates when the trajectory curvature is small .",
    "analogous results occur when varying the fill level . at low fill levels ,",
    "particle trajectories are more curved @xcite , which favors sls segregation . at high fill levels , trajectories are nearly straight @xcite , so the axial drift , as the particles segregate to different depths , dominates leading to the lsl segregation pattern .    at steady state for either sls or lsl patterns ,",
    "the particle trajectories appear to stabilize the pattern .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ trajbidicombi ] where we compare the trajectories of large and small particles by plotting pairs of trajectories for the two particle species at the boundary between the large and small particles . in the case of smooth walls ,",
    "the trajectories for the small and large particles diverge substantially even after only one pass through the flowing layer , resulting in displacement toward the pole for small particles , and displacement toward the equator for large particles , reinforcing the sls pattern .",
    "this is not the case for the lsl segregation pattern for rough walls where displacements are very small , and both toward the pole ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ trajbidicombi](b ) ) .",
    "both species have nearly the same axial position after one pass through the flowing layer .",
    "the axial segregation occurs indirectly as a result of the radial segregation in the flowing layer , which keeps large particles near the surface .",
    "consequently , the return flow toward the equator deep in the flowing layer consists of only small particles .",
    "thus small particles reach the surface only near the equator where the core current emerges .",
    "the consequence is a very sharp boundary at the surface between small and large particles for the sls segregation pattern and a more diffuse boundary for the lsl case ( see fig .",
    "[ trajbidicombi ] ) .",
    "these differences are also evident in the experimental results in fig .",
    "[ exproughsmooth ] and @xcite .",
    "a question that naturally arises is if wall coulomb friction could play a similar role to wall roughness in the evolution of segregation patterns based on the implicit assumption that a rough wall should have a similar effect to a high coefficient of friction for a smooth wall . to consider this",

    "[ indexvsrough ] .",
    "the greatest impact on the segregation index for a mixture of 2 and 4  mm particles occurs when the wall particle size is between 1 and 2  mm .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the perfectly smooth wall , modeled as spherical smooth surface with infinite mass , behaves similarly to a rough wall of 0.25  mm particles , suggesting that modeling a wall as fixed particles can be effective so long as the wall particles are much smaller than the flowing particles .              to further consider the relative size effects of the tumbler and particles",
    ", we performed a limited number of simulations with 1 and 2  mm particles in a 14  cm tumbler with both smooth and 1  mm rough walls .",

    "[ chasize](a ) demonstrate that relative particle and tumbler sizes make a difference for both smooth and rough walls .",
    "the decrease in particle size induces an increase in the axial segregation index .",
    "for example , in the smooth wall case , the 1 and 2  mm particles form an lsl pattern , while 2 and 4  mm particles form an sls pattern , consistent with experimental results @xcite .",
    "this is because particle trajectory curvature increases with particles size , but net axial drift remains almost independent of particles size @xcite , and large curvature trajectories favor sls segregation . with trajectory curvature being smaller for small particles ,",
    "a 1 + 2  mm particle system will adopt the lsl segregation pattern more easily than a 2 + 4  mm system , as is observed experimentally @xcite and shown in fig .",

    "bidisperse particle segregation in a spherical tumbler provides an ideal test for evaluating the impact of wall boundary conditions because of its sensitivity to the wall roughness and easily visualized results .",
    "it is clear that surface boundary conditions have a strong influence on the flow and subsequent segregation patterns .",
    "the bands form due to a combination of curved particle trajectories and the axial drift in the flowing layer .",
    "while the roughness of the walls determines the curvature and drift , these quantities along with radial size segregation determine the nature of the axial segregation pattern .",

    "axial sls patterns are more likely to occur .",
    "many questions remain including that of why the curvature and drift are so dependent upon the size of the system and rotation speed .",

    "<S> size bidisperse granular materials in a spherical tumbler segregate into two different patterns of three bands with either small particles at the equator and large particles at the poles or vice versa , depending upon the fill level in the tumbler . </S>",
    "<S> here we use discrete element method ( dem ) simulations with supporting qualitative experiments to explore the effect of the tumbler wall roughness on the segregation pattern , modeling the tumbler walls as either a closely packed monolayer of fixed particles resulting in a rough wall , or as a geometrically smooth wall . </S>",
    "<S> even though the tumbler wall is in contact with the flowing layer only at its periphery , the impact of wall roughness is profound . </S>",
    "<S> smooth walls tend toward a small - large - small ( sls ) band pattern at the pole - equator - pole at all but the highest fill fractions ; rough walls tend toward a large - small - large ( lsl ) band pattern at all but the lowest fill fractions . </S>",
    "<S> this comes about because smooth walls induce poleward axial drift of small particles and an equator - directed drift for large particles , resulting in an sls band pattern . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , rough walls result in both sizes of particles moving poleward at the surface of the flow , but due to radial segregation , small particles percolate lower in the flowing layer where there is a return drift toward the equator while large particles remain at the surface near the pole , resulting in an lsl band pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the tendency toward either of the two band patterns depends on the fill level in the tumbler and the roughness of the tumbler s bounding wall . </S>"
