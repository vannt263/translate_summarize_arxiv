    "the hodgkin - huxley model is one of the most studied models in neuroscience since its creation in the early 50 s by hodgkin and huxley @xcite .",
    "this deterministic model was first created in order to describe the propagation of an action potential or nerve impulse along the axon of a neuron of the giant squid . in our paper",
    ", we will consider a mathematical generalization of the hodgkin - huxley model investigated numerically in @xcite and analytically in @xcite .",
    "this model , called the spatial stochastic hodgkin - huxley model in the sequel , is made of a partial differential equation ( pde ) describing the evolution of the variation of the potential across the membrane , coupled with a continuous time markov chain which describes the dynamics of ion channels which are present all along the axon .",
    "it is a piecewise deterministic markov process ( pdmp ) in infinite dimensions ( see @xcite for pdmp in infinite dimensions and also @xcite and references therein for pdmp in finite dimension ) .",
    "moreover it is fully - coupled in the sense that the evolution of the potential depends on the kinetics of ion channels and vice - versa .",
    "the role of ion channels is fundamental because they allow and amplify the propagation of an action potential .",
    "we introduce different time scales in this model considering that some ion channels open and close at faster rates than others .",
    "we perform a slow - fast analysis of this model and prove that asymptotically it reduces to the so called averaged model which is still a pdmp in infinite dimensions for which we provide effective evolution equations and jump rates .",
    "we thus reduce the complexity of the original model by simplifying the kinetics of ion channels . to the best of our knowledge",
    "no averaging results are available for pdmp in infinite dimensions .",
    "even if the hodgkin - huxley model was first introduced in neurophysiology , its paradigm is commonly used to describe the behavior of cardiac cells , see for instance @xcite .",
    "it was at first deterministic . in order to include more variability , better describe the axon itself and a certain class of phenomena , stochastic versions of this model",
    "have been proposed since the 90 s , see for instance @xcite , introducing in the model two kinds of randomness .",
    "one is to include in the hodgkin - huxley equations an external noise modeling in this way the multitude of impulses received by one single neuron through its connections to the extraordinary complex system which is the brain .",
    "the other is to introduce in the hodgkin - huxley equations the intrinsic noise of the neuron due to the presence of ion channels which are intrinsically stochastic entities .",
    "the spatial stochastic hodgkin - huxley model which deals with the intrinsic noise of neurons pertains to the latter class .",
    "the generalized hodgkin - huxley equations of @xcite belong also to a larger class of stochastic systems describing the evolution of a macroscopic variable , here the membrane potential , coupled with a markovian dynamic modeling the kinetics of smaller entities , here ion channels .",
    "between two successive jumps of the markovian kinetics , the macroscopic variable follows a deterministic evolution .",
    "these models are known mathematically under the name of piecewise deterministic markov processes ( pdmp ) and are often called stochastic hybrid systems in the applications .",
    "the theory of pdmp in finite dimension ( dealing with ordinary differential equations coupled with markovian kinetics ) has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the extension to infinite dimensions ( dealing with pdes coupled with markovian kinetics ) has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the spatial stochastic hodgkin - huxley model belongs to the class of pdmp in infinite dimensions since the equation describing the evolution of the membrane potential is a pde .    reducing",
    "the complexity of a model is of first importance since it allows to perform more tractable mathematics and numerical simulations and in this way , to go further in the understanding of the model .",
    "the reduction can be achieved by two different means .",
    "the first is to consider that the number or the population of ion channels is large enough to apply a law of large numbers argument so that we can replace the empirical proportion of ion channels in a given state by the averaged theoretical proportion of ion channels in this state .",
    "this is achieved by letting the number of ion channels go to infinity , the corresponding law of large numbers is proved in @xcite and in the context of pdmp in @xcite . the second way to reduce the complexity of the model , the one we will be interested in in this paper , is to consider that the model has intrinsically two time scales .",
    "it is a quite natural approach in this context , see for instance @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "the number of ion channels is fixed and we consider that some ion channels have a faster dynamic than others .",
    "we perform then a slow - fast mathematical analysis of this two - time - scales system .",
    "we obtain a reduced system in which the intrinsic variability of ion channels is still taken into account but with a simplified kinetic .",
    "unlike the main result of @xcite , after reduction , we remain here at a stochastic level .",
    "the methods used in this paper are known mathematically under the name of stochastic averaging .",
    "as far as we know , these methods have never been applied to a pdmp in infinite dimensions which we are dealing with in the present paper . for pdmps in finite dimension ,",
    "a theory of averaging has been developed in @xcite and central limit theorem has been proved in @xcite .    in the infinite dimensional framework which we consider in this paper we have been able to reduce the complexity of a fully - coupled pdmp in infinite dimensions by using averaging methods .",
    "the natural step after this averaging result is to prove the central limit theorem associated to it .",
    "we wish to investigate this in a future work .",
    "we conclude this introduction with the plan of the paper . in section [ intro_math ]",
    "we introduce the spatial stochastic hodgkin - huxley model and the formalism of pdmp in infinite dimensions .",
