    "electron spin relaxation in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) has received much attention as they are a natural candidate for the qubit in quantum computing ( qc ) ( see refs .   and for a brief review ) .",
    "particularly , a significant effort has been devoted to investigate the spin transition probabilities associated with the spin - flip interactions , for example , the so - called longitudinal spin relaxation ( @xmath1 ) ( i.e. , energy relaxation ) induced via the inelastic process of phonon absorption / emission by an electron spin localized in a qd . although generally an importance source of decoherence , the spin - flip events can sometimes be efficiently suppressed by an appropriate choice of external conditions including the magnetic field strength or direction . in this case ,",
    "alternative mechanisms ( such as the elastic spin - phonon scattering that does not assume energy exchange between the electron zeeman energy and thermal bath ) can be primarily responsible for decoherence .",
    "so far , however , the elastic processes have received relatively little attention .",
    "this disparity may be due , in part , to the mathematical simplicity in the treatment of the former case ( e.g. , calculations based on the fermi s golden rule ) , while the elastic processes of spin decoherence need more sophistical approaches . at the same time",
    ", recent proliferation of the literature on electron spin relaxation has exacerbated the confusion on this complicated subject matter .",
    "frequently , an individual study addresses only a specific aspect of spin decoherence or dephasing without elucidating its place in the general theory or the interrelationships with other relevant works . consequently",
    ", one faces difficulties each time in determining which existing mechanisms , processes , or theories are relevant for spin relaxation under the given external conditions and specific qd properties .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to systematically identify and analyze the crucial transversal ( @xmath2 ) spin relaxation processes in the context of qubit dephasing in the electron spin based qc .",
    "specifically , the role of spin - phonon interaction on the elastic decoherence processes is examined theoretically from the perspective of the fluctuations in the effective magnetic field .",
    "the calculation identifies the conditions in which the elastic spin - lattice processes can dominate over the inelastic counterparts .",
    "the analysis is applicable to the electron spin in both group iv and iii - v qds .",
    "note that the related issues from the spintronics point of view were surveyed in refs .   and .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  ii provides a systematic classification of most , if not all , of the processes identified so far that lead to a type of electron spin relaxation ( i.e. , dephasing , decoherence or energy relaxation ) .",
    "then , the discussion focuses on those caused by the spin - phonon interaction and describes different manifestations of the spin - phonon interaction in a manner consistent to both elastic and inelastic processes .",
    "subsequently , the elastic decoherence processes that warrant further analysis are recognized and their potential significance outlined in the context of qc .",
    "section  iii summarizes a theoretical framework necessary for the mathematical description of electron spin relaxation in terms of quantum kinetic equation .",
    "each of the following three sections describes a particular elastic process that can be dominant under a certain condition . in sec",
    "iv , we analyze the effects of spin precession fluctuations due to the irregular phonon phase disturbances originating from phonon relaxation via the lattice anharmonicity or imperfections .",
    "such a situation applies not only to real ( thermally activated ) phonons but also to zero - point phonons that the classical picture can not address .",
    "section  v considers spin phase diffusion due to the modulations in the longitudinal g - factor and hyperfine interaction through the phonon - assisted transitions between the lowest electronic states ( without spin - flip ) .",
    "section  vi concerns electron spin in a semiconductor qd with multiple equivalent minima ( e.g. , si@xmath3ge@xmath4 ) .",
    "as the degeneracy is lifted due to structural inversion asymmetry , phonon - mediated transitions between the `` valley - split '' states can be allowed when the local crystal imperfections are present .",
    "this process can be very significant since the energy separation of the valley - split states is generally comparable to the thermal energy in the qc operation .",
    "then , the discussion on the comparative importance of different processes in the parameter space is provided in sec .",
    "vii , followed by a brief conclusion at the end .",
    "for a systematic analysis , table  i shows simple classification of the relevant spin relaxation processes identified so far .",
    "the term `` dephasing '' ( with the characteristic time @xmath5 ) concerns phase relaxation of a qc system consisting of multiple qubits , while `` decoherence '' ( @xmath2 ) is for a single qubit ( i.e. , single electron spin in a qd ) .",
    "hence , decoherence contributes to dephasing ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the `` random local fields '' category denotes the processes that lead to phase diffusion of the multi - qubit system without causing decoherence in the individual qubits .",
    "the decoherence or transversal relaxation has contributions from both the elastic and inelastic processes .",
    "the latter involves spin flip transitions leading to the energy ( or longitudinal ) relaxation of the spin states ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) . of the spin decoherence processes , those marked by the # sign in the table",
    "are induced by the spin - phonon interaction .",
    "the listed @xmath2 processes correspond to the uncontrollable interactions with the environment that assumes to be in a thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature @xmath8 .",
    "inaccuracies in the parameters of the control pulses during qc operations as well as uncontrollable perturbations introduced with these pulses are beyond the current description .",
    "table  ii summarizes various manifestations of the spin - phonon mechanism in a manner consistent to both elastic and inelastic processes . a brief description on each category is given below .      the fastest relaxation in a quantum computer consisting of a large number of qubits [ @xmath9 ( see ref .",
    ") ] is the dephasing process associated with transversal magnetization loss with the characteristic time @xmath5 .",
    "clearly , the electrons experience a dispersion of spin precession in the presence of a random effective magnetic field . even when the magnetic field can be considered a constant spatially and temporally for a given qubit within the time scale of qc operation , its random variation across the ensemble of qubits can induce dephasing of the system .",
    "although some of its effect may be potentially mitigated by qc algorithms,@xcite the absence of this additional complexity provides an obvious advantage .",
    "one reason for the dispersion in the precession frequency is the @xmath10-tensor variation over the @xmath11 qubits .",
    "consequently , even in a very pure crystal , the unavoidable fluctuation in the qd sizes results in the @xmath10-factor dispersion @xmath12 , which subsequently induces dephasing with the rate of @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the bohr magneton and @xmath15 the external magnetic field ) .",
    "this mechanism of spin phase relaxation has not yet been investigated in the zero - dimensional ( 0d ) structures .",
    "a related case of 2d hole localization in a fluctuating potential was studied in refs .   and .",
    "in addition , the randomness of spin - orbital coupling in a quantum well due to the fluctuation of dopant concentration was considered in ref .  .",
    "similarly , electron interaction with nuclear spins can induce the spin phase diffusion due to the random distribution of the nuclear spin states and their spatial locations .",
    "@xcite in principle , replacement of the magnetic isotopes by nonmagnetic counterparts ( @xmath16 ) can remove or suppress this source of relaxation .",
    "@xcite however , it may not be a practical option as a significant level of purification is required to be effective ; the dephasing rate depends only weakly on the nuclear spin concentration @xmath17 ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) .",
    "as indicated in table  i , the random fields of magnetic impurities also contribute to the dephasing process .",
    "the last one listed in this category , the magneto - dipole interaction between the qubits , plays a specific role since it can be incorporated ( thus , eliminated ) to the qc algorithm under certain conditions .",
    "@xcite      among the inelastic processes in table  i , the direct spin - flip via one phonon emission / absorption ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is the most studied due to its simplicity in concept as well as the importance at low temperatures .",
    "khaetskii01,tahan02,gk03,golovach04,falko05,sherman05 the rate of this process is proportional to the phonon density of states @xmath19 at the resonant phonon energy @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) as well as the square of the spin - phonon matrix element ( @xmath22 . as a result , a strong magnetic field dependence ( @xmath23 ) is expected for the direct spin - flip .",
    "thus , at low magnetic fields , the effect of this process can be significantly reduced . when @xmath24 , the influence of the temperature can be ignored as the phonon emission determines the relaxation rate .",
    "the orbach process@xcite considers the spin - flip events through successive transitions between the ground and excited orbital states separated by an energy @xmath25 .",
    "for example , an electron first makes a spin - flip transition to the excited state with opposite spin by absorbing a phonon with energy @xmath26 , followed by the return to the ground state through emission of a phonon with energy @xmath25 .",
    "an alternative channel is to make a transition to the excited state without spin flip ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) and , then , return to the ground state with opposite spin ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus , the net effect is the electron spin flip with the energy of @xmath27 ( i.e. , the zeeman splitting ) transferred to the thermal bath . under certain conditions",
    ", the corresponding matrix elements can exceed those for the direct spin - flip transitions between the kramers doublet .  @xcite it should be stressed that the orbach process assumes two one - phonon transitions in tandem .",
    "hence , the first transition with the energy threshold of @xmath28 or @xmath25 provides the primary temperature dependence along with a weak influence of the magnetic field .",
    "the two - phonon process concerns the longitudinal spin relaxation via two - phonon absorption , emission or inelastic phonon scattering ( raman process ) .",
    "it can be further divided into three groups ; the direct spin@xmath29two - phonon transitions due to the nonlinearity of the spin - phonon hamiltonian  @xcite [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , the virtual transitions mediated by one - phonon interactions through the excited states  @xcite [ fig  2(b ) ] , and the anharmonic raman process  @xcite [ fig .",
    "in the case of virtual transitions , the integration over phonons includes the poles at the phonon energy @xmath30 if @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the debye temperature .",
    "the treatment of this singularity ( the so - called phonon resonant fluorescence ) beyond the conventional perturbation theory@xcite involves essentially the finite lifetime @xmath33 of the excited states that exactly reproduces the relaxation rate of the orbach process .",
    "orbach61,aminov72 this coincidence / similarity is lifted ( i.e. poles can be ignored as compared with orbach process ) when the finite phonon lifetime @xmath34 is considered since @xmath35 . as the processes involving the inelastic phonon scattering show a strong dependence on temperature ( @xmath36 ) ,  @xcite it has been mostly ignored in the consideration of qc that operates at very low temperatures . however",
    ", a recent analysis  @xcite suggests its potential significance in the low magnetic field regime due to the weak dependence on the field strength ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the process of directly transferring the electron zeeman energy to the nuclear dipole - dipole reservoir is another possible channel for longitudinal relaxation .",
    "@xcite this , however , can be effective only in the external magnetic fields comparable or weaker than the local nuclear fields , which are generally sufficiently small .",
    "in addition to those listed in table  i , the simultaneous flip - flop of several spins generally entails energy exchange with the phonon or spin - spin reservoir .",
    "much less attention has been paid to such processes in the literature .",
    "altshuler74,sousa031,cheng04      the elastic processes can be imagined as a result of uncontrollable fluctuations of zeeman frequency or its equivalent , i.e. , the fluctuations of longitudinal magnetic field that conserve the electron spin projection on the quantization axis .",
    "as summarized in table  i , there are at least four different manifestations of this process . of these ,",
    "the first one listed ( `` anharmonic vibration '' ) represents the case that the irregular phonon phase disturbances originating from the phonon relaxation induces a net effect of electron spin phase decay via the spin - phonon interaction . if the phonons are treated as harmonic oscillators without damping , the longitudinal component of the `` effective '' interaction field takes the form of a harmonic perturbation and does not cause alteration in the electron spin phase .",
    "skdecay04 [ one exception may be the small spin phase decoherence ( @xmath38 ) that can be acquired under the additional assumption of identical phase for all the harmonic phonon modes at the initial instant .",
    "mozyrsky02 ] however , a different situation can be realized when the phonon oscillation is interrupted by a series of random phase disturbances as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "the reason of such phonon phase steps can be lattice anharmonicity , phonon scattering at the impurities or lattice defects , etc .",
    "these irregular phonon phase perturbations affect the electron spin precession resulting in its phase relaxation .",
    "@xcite    the fluctuations in the local effective magnetic field ( and , thus , spin decoherence ) can also result from the transitions between the electronic ( orbital ) states with different zeeman frequencies .",
    "as the electron experiences the stochastic transitions between these orbital states without spin flip , electron spin phase can change due to the finite and random lifetime in the states with different precession frequencies ( fig .",
    "4 ) .  skprl04 it should be emphasized that although the transitions are mediated by phonons , the energy exchange between the zeeman and phonon reservoirs does not take place in contrast to the orbach process ; i.e. , this case undoubtedly belongs to the elastic processes .",
    "electron spin can accumulate the phase shift through random thermal changes in the nuclear spin distribution as well .",
    "although a quantum state of individual nuclear spin generally has a relatively long lifetime , a large ensemble of nuclear spins ( or spin flip transitions ) produces a rapidly evolving effective field distribution .",
    "its significance can be gauged in terms of electron resonant frequency diffusion ( i.e. , the so - called _ spectral diffusion _ ) in the spin - echo experiments .",
    "klauder62,mims68,chiba72,sousa03,tyryshkin03 a peculiar property of this process is the cubic exponential decay of spin - echo signal @xmath39 $ ] , where the memory time @xmath40 can be calculated in the model of uncorrelated nuclear spin flips@xcite or in the model taking into account the flip - flop processes for nuclear spin pairs.sousa03 note that the spectral diffusion process is probably irrelevant to qc where only the initial phase decay of @xmath41 matters for fault tolerant operation . in the corresponding short time frame , the processes with a linear exponential decay prevail as demonstrated in ref .  .",
    "decoherence can also be attributed to isolated ( i.e. non - interacting ) nuclear spins .",
    "@xcite this is because each nuclear spin precesses around the electron hyperfine field , which is inhomogeneous over the qd volume .",
    "such uncorrelated nuclear spin precession , in turn , leads to the change in the strength of nuclear hyperfine interaction field affecting the electron spin and its phase .",
    "the efficiency of this process , however , is much weaker than that of spectral diffusion when the inter - nuclear interaction is taken into account .",
    "the elastic processes in table  i include the one mediated by fluctuations of berry geometric phase .",
    "@xcite the efficiency of this process compared to the others is not clearly understood yet . in addition , an elastic phonon scattering on a group of spins can cause them out of phase .",
    "@xcite however , this process is less relevant for single qubit decoherence .",
    "table  ii summarizes the microscopic mechanisms of spin - phonon interaction that give rise to the elastic and inelastic spin relaxation processes ( marked by # in table  i ) . despite the great multiplicity of the mechanisms considered in the literature",
    ", they can be classified into three groups following the global characteristics ; i.e. , the mechanisms resulting from the ( i ) spin - orbit , ( ii ) hyperfine , and ( iii ) spin - spin interactions . in turn , these interactions manifest themselves in a number of different ways , all of which can contribute to spin phase and longitudinal relaxation .    taking into account that interactions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) mentioned above possess , generally speaking , non - zero matrix elements between the states appurtenant to the zeeman doublet , their modulation by phonon vibrations can be expressed as a hamiltonian realizing the spin - phonon interaction ( listed as `` direct '' in table  ii ) .",
    "mathematically , if a phonon mediates an electronic potential @xmath42 , the spin - orbit interaction is changed by the term @xmath43% \\mathbf{s}$ ] ( `` soi modulation '' mechanism ) . at the same time",
    ", the shift @xmath44 of an atomic position from the site @xmath45 due to the lattice vibration ( i.e. , phonons ) also changes the hamiltonian for the hyperfine interaction @xmath46 by @xmath47 ( `` hfi modulation '' mechanism ) ; here , @xmath48 is the hyperfine interaction tensor .",
    "the case of spin - orbit interaction adapted to the qds was considered in ref .  .",
    "direct phonon fluctuations of hyperfine interaction were studied for a donor in silicon ,  @xcite @xmath49-centers in alkali halides ,  @xcite and adapted to qds .",
    "@xcite    in a similar manner , one can introduce the spin - phonon interaction mediated by the spin - spin interactions @xmath50 . in this case , one can further separate the dipole - dipole and exchange interactions . obviously , these mechanisms depend on the inter - spin distances .",
    "phonon modulation of dipole - dipole interaction ( `` waller '' mechanism ) was considered in ref .  ; the role of exchange interaction including the dzialoshinski - moria terms  @xcite ( that can be important in crystals with no inversion symmetry  @xcite ) was analyzed in ref .  .",
    "the direct mechanisms considered above are not the only manifestation of the spin - phonon interactions . in the strict sense ,",
    "the kramers doublets actually represent non - multiplicative functions of spin and space variables due to the the spin - orbit or hyperfine interactions ( i.e. , mixing of orbital and spin states ; `` admixture '' in table  ii ) .",
    "this makes a spin - independent phonon potential capable of evoking the transitions between the kramers doublet .",
    "such a mechanism becomes apparent in the case of hole spin relaxation in a qd , where the spin - orbit interaction imposes a linear combination of different spin and orbital states for the basis of valence band .",

    "( [ p1 ] ) represents the spin - phonon interaction as the process of virtual transition to the spin - flip excited state due to @xmath58 followed by a transition to the ground state without spin flip via the spin - independent electron - phonon interaction , or vice versa . in the case of electron in a qd",
    ", this mechanism can possess an advantage over the direct spin - phonon interaction due to the relatively strong spin coupling between the non - kramers ( i.e. , orbital ) states .",
    "a distinctive feature of such indirect spin - phonon interactions is their proportionality to the matrix elements of electron - phonon interaction between the ground and excited states .",
    "consequently , these mechanisms can be further classified based on the types of electron - phonon interactions as well as the potentials that cause effective mixture of the ground and excited states .",
    "the mechanism caused by simultaneous manifestation of spin - orbit and spin - independent electron - phonon interactions was initially developed by kronig  @xcite and van vleck  @xcite for magnetic ions .",
    "adaptation of this `` kronig - van vleck '' mechanism to the conduction electrons in a qd can be conveniently achieved by extracting the spin - orbit coupling in the form of the rashba and dresselhause terms ( which efficiently mix the qd ground and excited states ) .",
    "@xcite then , the phonon potential of various origins such as the deformation potential , piezoelectric potential,@xcite or the ripple effect at the qd interface@xcite gives rise to the effective spin - phonon coupling in the second order .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling in the valence band is generally much stronger ; hence , _",
    "holes _ are less attractive as a qubit.@xcite    when @xmath58 is due to the hyperfine interaction , the spin flip can be considered in a manner similar to that with the spin - orbit interaction as discussed in refs .   and ;",
    "an isomorphous case of a diluted magnetic semiconductor qd was also investigated .",
    "@xcite it seems that this admixture spin - phonon interaction is more effective than the direct counterpart ( i.e. , phonon modulation of the hyperfine interaction ) . as to the spin - spin interactions ( both dipole - dipole and exchange ) , they can also induce the mixing of spin and orbital states similarly ; however , such a treatment has not yet been developed to the best of our knowledge .",
    "in addition to the direct and admixture mechanisms discussed above , one can also consider `` indirect '' manifestation of spin dependent interactions .",
    "this group of mechanisms accounts for the random fluctuations in the effective field through the phonon - mediated stochastic transitions between different orbital states . as the characteristics of @xmath10-tensor , hyperfine field , or spin - spin interactions vary with the orbital states , electrons experience uncontrollable changes in these parameters while undergoing spin - independent phonon scattering between them .",
    "such fluctuations cause the transversal relaxation of electron spin  @xcite along with a potential contribution to the longitudinal relaxation .",
    "however , the latter ( i.e. , spin - flip ) is expected to be small due to the negligibly small influence on the spectral density at typical zeeman frequencies .",
    "finally , there is a higher - order phonon - mediated mechanism that can affect the spin relaxation .",
    "although the phonon potential @xmath42 can not influence spin precession directly , its incorporation with the electron potential @xmath60 , which contributes to the @xmath10-tensor in a different manner,@xcite results in a specific spin - phonon interaction @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are the components of electron spin operator .",
    "this mechanism was analyzed in a qd with respect to the orbach spin - flip processes  @xcite as well as in a bulk semiconductor .",
    "@xcite    in summarizing the possible mechanisms of spin - phonon interaction , it must be pointed out that all of them make _ correlated _ contributions to the processes marked # in table i. for example , the direct spin - flip process results from the phonon - induced fluctuation of the effective magnetic field ( with the resonant frequency @xmath27 ) that is realized by additive contributions from the spin - phonon mechanisms listed in table  ii ( i.e. , the spin - orbit , hyperfine , and spin - spin interactions ) .",
    "consequently , the corresponding matrix elements of individual mechanisms must be summed before the probability of any process is calculated .",
    "although the importance of interference for certain mechanisms was already discussed in refs .   and , it requires further theoretical scrutiny .",
    "however , the anticipated difficulty may be circumvented for reasonably weak magnetic fields if the spin - phonon hamiltonian @xmath63 is considered in terms of a phenomenological tensor @xmath64 following the analysis of ref .  .",
    "this parameter @xmath65 is designed to represent the net / total contribution of the spin - orbit mechanisms and can be found experimentally from the dependence of electron paramagnetic resonance signal on the applied stress .",
    "as for the contributions of different processes ( table i ) to spin relaxation , they do not interfere and , thus , can be considered independently . as mentioned earlier , the present paper investigate dominant elastic spin relaxation processes via the spin - phonon mechanisms , particularly those originated from the spin - orbit and hyperfine interactions .",
    "with the mechanisms responsible for the spin - phonon interaction @xmath66 ascertained in table  ii , the evolution of electron spin can be described according to the rubrics under `` decoherence ( @xmath67 ) '' in table i. in contrast to the calculation of @xmath66 that requires individualized treatments for each mechanisms , most processes , elastic and inelastic , marked by # in table i ( with an exception of `` geometric phase '' process ) can be approached by a general formalism based on kinetic equations . for simplicity ,",
    "the derivation of these equations is restricted to the first born approximation in the present consideration . as such , the two - phonon processes , which appear on the second order of @xmath66 [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] , are not included .",
    "there are several comparable approaches to describe the evolution of spin @xmath68 interacting with a thermal bath . for the purposes of decoherence evaluation in the qds ,",
    "it is desirable to apply a system of equations directly for the mean spin components ( rather than for the density matrix components ) , which analyze their temporal progression on the bloch sphere from an initial state to that corresponding to the thermal equilibrium of the system . at the same time",
    ", it is desirable to express the relaxation coefficients in terms of the spectral density of the thermal bath operators that allows application of the formalism well - developed in the case of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "finally , the equations must correctly account for the anisotropy of spin interaction with the thermal bath .",
    "such equations were studied previously in the cases of specific symmetry properties of the correlation functions .",
    "@xcite this section generalizes and adopts these equations to the problem of spin decoherence .",
    "it is convenient to represent the hamiltonian of one electron system in terms of the effective spin operator @xmath69 for the kramers doublet @xmath70 of the ground electronic state .",
    "the linear magnetic splitting of kramers doublet @xmath71 is described by an effective hamiltonian in the common form @xmath72 , where the @xmath10-tensor @xmath73 is introduced .",
    "similarly , the electron spin interaction @xmath66 with the thermal bath ( of hamiltonian @xmath74 ) is expressible as a linear form of the spin operators , @xmath75 if only the states @xmath71 are involved in the relaxation .",
    "actually , @xmath66 also describes the transitions between different kramers doublets .",

    "for example , the off - diagonal elements of @xmath66 between @xmath71 and @xmath76 states can be eliminated through the procedure of canonical transformation .",
