    "integral equation theories for the description of thermodynamic and structural properties of liquids usually lead to qualitatively satisfactory results . nonetheless , in general they involve hard numerical labor as well as criteria to formulate the closure relations that are not clearcut .",
    "this is true even for the simplest and most studied systems , namely the pure hard - sphere fluid and hard - sphere fluid mixtures .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that many attempts at providing general features , symmetries , approximations or parametrizations of the so - called bridge functions have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "these bridge functions enter in the closure relations and are defined as the sum of elementary diagrams ( whose precise computation is a formidable and rather difficult task ) ; they account for some molecular spatial correlations of higher order than pair correlations .",
    "of course the availability of the analytical results provided by the percus - yevick ( py ) theory @xcite in the case of the pure hard - sphere fluid @xcite and hard - sphere fluid mixtures @xcite allows one to determine explicitly the bridge functions in this instance , but they inherit the ( theoretically ) unpleasant lack of thermodynamic consistency as well as the limited density range of applicability involved in the py approximation .    in a related context , it is worth pointing out that in the pioneering work of rosenfeld and ashcroft @xcite it was found that an important class of pair potentials shared the property that their corresponding bridge functions were remarkably similar to each other and to the hard - sphere bridge function .",
    "this observation led to the common form of the reference - hypernetted chain theory @xcite , considered by many to be perhaps the most accurate theory for the structural properties of fluids , in which the bridge functions of the system of interest are equated to those of a hard - sphere system .",
    "thus , the search for accurate and relatively simple approximations for the bridge functions of a pure hard - sphere fluid and hard - sphere fluid mixtures has been pursued in the last few years .",
    "notable among the results of this pursuit are the empirical parametrization due to malijevsk and labk ( ml ) for the hard - sphere fluid and its recent extension to binary hard - sphere mixtures @xcite .",
    "these involve a careful and thorough analysis of a large set of computer simulation data .",
    "some apparent regularities of the bridge functions in the case of binary mixtures ( present in the py results and in recent simulation data of malijevsk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) has been recently suggested by guzmn and del ro @xcite . were this regularities to hold in general , they would allow one to simplify the ml parametrization and serve as a starting point to consider hard - sphere mixtures with three or more components . due to the scarcity of simulation data for mixtures , the suggestion remains a mere conjecture up to now .",
    "notwithstanding the merits of all these theoretical and semiempirical efforts , it is clear that , especially in the case of mixtures , the scarcity of results and the relatively slow progress reflect the amount and difficulty of the numerical work that has to be done to get them .",
    "therefore , one may reasonably wonder whether an alternative theoretical approach , that at least avoided the inherent difficulty of solving nonlinear integral equations , would also provide information on the bridge functions of the pure hard - sphere fluid and hard - sphere mixtures",
    ". it is the major aim of this paper to provide an affirmative answer to the foregoing question .    in previous work",
    "@xcite we have introduced a method to analytically derive ( approximate ) expressions for the radial distribution functions and structure factors of fluids and fluid mixtures .",
    "this method rests on a completely different philosophy than the one involved in integral equation theories and thus is totally void of the difficulty associated with providing any particular closure . in the case of pure hard - sphere fluids and hard - sphere mixtures and in the lowest order of approximation , it yields the well known py results .",
    "furthermore and by construction , our expressions in the next order of approximation , which yields results practically equivalent to those of the generalized mean spherical approximation ( gmsa ) @xcite but is much simpler to implement , also embody thermodynamic consistency .",
    "as shown below , by using such radial distribution functions in connection with the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation it is rather straightforward to derive the direct correlation functions and , in turn , the bridge functions of the system , this latter for distances greater than the contact distance .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in section [ sec.2 ]",
    "we outline the main ideas of our method to obtain the radial distribution functions of an @xmath0-component mixture of additive hard - spheres . for this mixture",
    "the boublk - mansoori - carnahan - starling - leland ( bmcsl ) @xcite equation of state and the grundke - henderson - lee - levesque ( ghll ) @xcite contact values of the radial distribution functions , which yield the bmcsl equation of state , are assumed to hold .",
    "if @xmath0 is set equal to one then the pure hard - sphere fluid case readily follows .",
    "expressions for the direct correlation functions are given there .",
    "section [ sec.3 ] provides an analysis of the bridge functions as well as a comparison with previous work .",
    "we close the paper in section [ sec.4 ] with further discussion and some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we outline the method to obtain ( approximate ) analytical expressions for the radial distribution functions @xmath1 of a multicomponent hard - sphere mixture .",
    "it consists of an extension to mixtures of the method previously applied to one - component systems of hard spheres , sticky hard spheres , and square wells @xcite . for details",
    "the reader may refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an @xmath0-component mixture made of @xmath2 hard spheres ( of diameter @xmath3 ) per volume unit may be characterized by @xmath4 parameters ( for instance , the @xmath5 molar fractions @xmath6 , the @xmath5 size ratios @xmath7 and the packing fraction @xmath8 ) and involves @xmath9 radial distribution functions @xmath1 .",
    "as happens in the py and gmsa theories , it is convenient to work in the laplace space and define @xmath10 there are two basic requirements that @xmath11 must satisfy . first , since @xmath12 for @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , and @xmath15",
    ", this implies that ( i ) @xmath16 .",
    "second , the isothermal compressibility @xmath17 , so that ( ii ) @xmath18=\\mbox{finite}$ ] . the approximation we will use consists of assuming the following functional form : @xmath19^{-1}}_{kj } ,   \\label{g(s)}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the @xmath21 unit matrix , @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24.\\ ] ]    condition ( i ) is verified by construction . on the other hand ,",
    "condition ( ii ) yields two _ linear _ sets of @xmath25 equations each , whose solution is straightforward , namely @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( which play a role similar to that of the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the gmsa ) are arbitrary , so that conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are satisfied regardless of their choice .",
    "in particular , if one chooses @xmath34 , our approximation coincides with the py solution .",
    "if , on the other hand , we fix given values for @xmath35 , we get the relationship @xmath36 thus , only @xmath31 remains to be determined .",
    "finally , if we fix @xmath37 , we obtain a closed equation for @xmath31 of degree @xmath38 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in the particular case of a pure hard - sphere fluid ( @xmath39 ) one gets a quadratic algebraic equation for @xmath40 , while for a binary mixture ( @xmath41 ) the _ explicit _ knowledge of @xmath11 only requires to solve a quartic equation , which also has an _ analytical _ solution .",
    "a natural choice to close the scheme , which we will of course consider in this paper , is to take the ghll values @xcite of @xmath42 , as well as the corresponding bmcsl @xcite isothermal compressibility @xmath37 .",
    "but other possibilities are available and one of them will also be addressed later on .",
    "once @xmath11 has been determined , inverse laplace transformation directly yields @xmath43 , while the fourier transforms @xmath44 of the total correlation functions @xmath45 readily follow from the relation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the imaginary unit . in fourier space and introducing the quantities",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 the oz equation reads @xmath50^{-1 } , \\ ] ] so that after replacement of @xmath51 and subsequent inverse fourier transformation it is straightforward to get @xmath52 .",
    "the result gives @xmath52 for @xmath53 as the superposition of @xmath0 yukawas ( see the appendix ) : @xmath54 , \\label{c(r)}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 with @xmath56 are the zeros of @xmath57 $ ] and the amplitudes @xmath58 are obtained by applying the residue theorem as @xmath59    finally , we note that the bridge functions @xmath60 for @xmath53 are linked to @xmath1 and @xmath52 through @xmath61 equations ( [ c(r ) ] ) and ( [ b(r ) ] ) , after replacement of the results for @xmath1 , will be used below to investigate some properties of the bridge functions @xmath60 in pure hard - sphere fluids and hard - sphere mixtures .",
    "we begin with the pure hard - sphere fluid , that is , we now consider the case when @xmath39",
    ". for this system a variety of closures to the oz equation are available @xcite , for instance @xmath62-\\gamma(r)\\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath63 @xmath64 ^ 2}{2 \\left\\{1+a_{1 }   \\gamma(r)\\right\\}}\\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath65^{1/2}-\\gamma(r)-1\\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath66\\gamma(r)\\right\\}-1}{1-\\exp(-a_{2 }   r ) } \\right\\}-\\gamma(r)\\ ;   , \\ ] ] @xmath67^{1/a_{3 } } -\\gamma(r)-1\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath68 and the labels hnc , vm , ms , ry and bpgg denote the hypernetted - chain @xcite , verlet modified @xcite , martynov - sarkisov @xcite , rogers - young @xcite and ballone - pastore - galli - gazzillo @xcite closures , respectively , and the adjustable parameters @xmath69 have been estimated to take the values @xmath70 @xcite , @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "it is at this point interesting to analyze to what extent the bridge functions calculated upon substitution in such closures of our expressions for the radial distribution function and direct correlation function differ or are compatible with the actual bridge function computed using equation ( [ b(r ) ] ) . to this end",
    ", we introduce the quantity @xmath73 , where the asterisk refers to a given label .",
    "notice that in particular @xmath74 and @xmath75 $ ] . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we display the behavior of @xmath76 as a function of the shifted distance @xmath77 for a packing fraction @xmath78 , i.e. close to the freezing transition .",
    "clearly the main discrepancies between both types of calculation show up near the contact point , but one could reasonably argue that the ry , the ms and the vm closures are rather compatible with the result of the present approach in that region .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] displays the results for the bridge function as obtained with the py theory , the parametrization of malijevsk and labk ( ml ) @xcite and our formulation , again for the packing fraction @xmath79 .",
    "as clearly seen in the figure , the discrepancy between the results of the parametrization and both ours and those of the py theory is rather significant .",
    "also , although not perceptible in the scale of the figure , we note that in our case the first maximum of the bridge function attains a positive value , whereas both the ml parametrization and the py theory always lead to non - positive values for the bridge function .",
    "we will come back to this point later on .",
    "we now turn to binary mixtures . in figures",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] results for the different bridge functions are shown for two cases . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , which corresponds to the case examined by guzmn and del ro @xcite , it is an equimolar mixture with @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; the second mixture is defined by @xmath78 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we have also included in these figures the results obtained with the py approximation .",
    "the differences between the results of both approaches are particularly important in the first maximum of the bridge functions and once more in our case we get some intervals of positive values .",
    "these figures also illustrate the fact that the phase - shift symmetry that was recently conjectured by guzmn and del ro @xcite to hold on the basis of the behavior observed in figure [ fig3 ] , is not even present in the py theory , particularly at short distances , and this becomes more evident as the disparity in size ratio is increased , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .    as another illustration , in figures",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] we display results for a ternary mixture where @xmath79 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . apart from exhibiting a more complicated structure than in the case of binary mixtures notice , for example , the existence of a negative first maximum for @xmath89 and @xmath90 , again an important difference between our results and those of the py theory is that we may get positive values for the bridge functions in some regions .",
    "thus far we have only considered the ghll prescription for the contact values @xmath42 and the isothermal compressibility @xmath37 derived from the bmcsl equation of state as the input in our method",
    ". one may reasonably wonder whether the use of different values for @xmath42 and/or @xmath37 would also yield similar results . in order to assess the importance of other reasonable choices",
    ", we have made calculations using the contact values @xmath42 obtained by extrapolation of simulation results @xcite and the value of @xmath91 derived from an equation of state for mixtures ( ecs ) recently proposed by us @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the results one gets with these choices , in figure [ fig7 ] we compare the various calculations of the function @xmath92 for the case considered earlier in figure [ fig4 ] , namely the binary mixture defined by @xmath78 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . except in the region up to the first maximum and near the second minimum , the curves obtained with either the bmcsl equation of state and with the second choice ( ecs ) using our procedure are practically indistinguishable .",
    "nevertheless , although the first maximum with the ecs choice is still positive , its amplitude is much smaller than the one using the bmcsl equation of state , up to a point that the positive character can be hardly ascertained in the scale of the figure .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the value of @xmath31 is more sensitive to the choice of @xmath37 than to the values of @xmath93 .",
    "in fact , for this mixture one gets @xmath94 using the bmcsl equation of state while @xmath95 using our proposal ( ecs ) for the equation of state .",
    "a smaller value of @xmath40 means that @xmath96 goes to zero more rapidly which in turn implies a much smaller ( but still positive ) value for the first maximum of @xmath92 in the latter case .",
    "the points arising from the results of the previous sections deserve further elaboration . to begin with , it is fair to say that our approach leads to a simple and clearcut procedure to determine both the bridge functions and the direct correlation functions in a multicomponent hard - sphere mixture , requiring as the _ only input _ the contact values of the radial distribution functions that specify the actual equation of state of the mixture .",
    "it should be pointed out that while the procedure is capable of yielding the values of the direct correlation functions for all distances , including those inside the hard cores , in the case of the bridge functions it is limited to distances greater than the contact distance .",
    "this is due to the fact that our method does not deal neither with closures nor with the cavity functions .",
    "nevertheless , this restriction may be disposed of , at least for the case of the pure hard - sphere fluid , by considering approximate analytical forms of the cavity function that are available in the literature @xcite . in this connection",
    ", we should mention that the form of the cavity function derived by zhou and stell @xcite has been shown to be compatible with our @xmath97 in the sense that it yields the same values for both @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xcite . if the available simulation results for the radial distribution functions for mixtures are scarce , those for the bridge functions are to our knowledge nonexistent . in the absence of such data to compare with the results we have presented , it would be of course premature to reach definite conclusions .",
    "one could argue that the accuracy of the bridge functions might be estimated indirectly by comparing the radial distribution functions calculated using the oz equation with a given closure and simulation results . in the present approach , however , this is unnecessary since we have explicit ( analytical ) expressions for the radial distribution functions from the very beginning , and these have been already compared to simulation results both for the one - component and two - component hard - sphere systems in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a key difference between our results for the bridge functions and most of those previously reported , is the fact that in our case these functions may attain both _ positive and negative _ values . in connection with this issue",
    "one can not overlook the fact that it has often been assumed that the bridge functions should be nonpositive .",
    "this is certainly the case in the py theory and various parametrizations and approximations have included such an assumption .",
    "nevertheless , as rast _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have recently pointed out , there seems to be no rigorous reason or argument stating that it should be so .",
    "in fact , any theory that leads to a positive value of the direct correlation function @xmath100 at a distance where @xmath101 will produce a positive @xmath102 at that distance .",
    "for instance , taking the monte carlo data for @xmath100 obtained by groot _",
    "_ @xcite and those of @xmath97 given by barker and henderson @xcite , one finds that @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in further support of the likely correctness of our results",
    ", one can invoke the fact that in our case thermodynamic consistency is an ingredient of the formulation while for instance the py theory does not share this property .",
    "for the pure hard - sphere fluid , the reasonable compatibility between our bridge function and the one computed using in particular the ry closure ( which was originally proposed to achieve thermodynamic consistency ) is very satisfactory in this respect .",
    "further , the fact that our @xmath1 are in better agreement with simulation results than those of the py theory particularly in the region around the contact point @xcite also favors the present approach .    concerning the ml parametrization for mixtures and the apparent regularity of the shifted bridge functions that was conjectured to hold in general in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can only add that unfortunately it does not do so .",
    "indeed , it would have been rather remarkable that the relatively simple forms proposed for the bridge functions would have been able to capture the rich and varied behaviors that one would expect from the number of parameters involved in the description of mixtures .",
    "finally , we want to point out that due to the similarity of the bridge functions corresponding to different potentials and those of hard - spheres @xcite in fact the _ universality _ of the hard - sphere bridge functional has been recently shown to be very reliable @xcite these results are not only relevant for hard - sphere mixtures , but they may also prove useful in connection with the integral equation approach in liquid theory for mixtures with other interaction potentials .",
    "fruitful discussions with f. del ro , who suggested this problem to us , are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "one of us ( m.l.h . ) wants to thank the universidad de extremadura at badajoz , where the draft of the paper was prepared , for its hospitality .",
    "he also acknowledges the partial support of dgapa - unam under project in-117798 .",
    "the work of two of us ( s.b.y . and a.s .",
    ") has been partially supported by dges ( spain ) through grant no .",

    "transform @xmath106 one can get the direct correlation function in real space as @xmath107 it is now convenient to see @xmath108 as a complex variable .",
