    "<S> parton distributions are constructed in a statistical physical picture of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral properties of qcd lead to strong relations between quarks and antiquarks distributions and the importance of the pauli exclusion principle is also emphasized . </S>",
    "<S> a global next - to - leading order qcd analysis of unpolarized and polarized deep - inelastic scattering data is performed to determine a small number of free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> some predictions are compared to recent experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> we also present an extension of the statistical approach to the description of baryon fragmentation functions .    deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons on hadrons has been extensively studied , over the last twenty years or so , both theoretically and experimentally , to extract the polarized parton distributions functions ( pdf ) of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> as it is well known , the unpolarized light quarks ( @xmath0 ) distributions are fairly well determined . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the data exhibit a clear evidence for a flavor - asymmetric light sea , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath1 , which can be understood in terms of the pauli exclusion principle , based on the fact that the proton contains two @xmath2 quarks and only one @xmath3 quark . </S>",
    "<S> larger uncertainties still persist for the gluon ( @xmath4 ) and the heavy quarks ( @xmath5 ) distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding polarized gluon and @xmath6 quark distributions ( @xmath7 ) are badly constrained and we just begin to uncover a flavor asymmetry , for the corresponding polarized light sea , namely @xmath8 . whereas the signs of the polarized light quarks distributions are essentially well established , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , this is not the case for @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in this report , essentially based on refs.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we briefly recall how we construct a complete set of polarized parton ( all flavor quarks , antiquarks and gluon ) distributions . </S>",
    "<S> our motivation is to use the statistical approach to build up : @xmath13 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath4 and @xmath17 , in terms of a very small number of free parameters . a flavor separation for the unpolarized and polarized light sea is automatically achieved in a way dictated by our approach .    the existence of the correlation , broader shape higher first moment , suggested by the pauli principle , has inspired the introduction of fermi - dirac ( bose - einstein ) functions for the quark ( gluon ) distributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after many years of research , we recently proposed @xcite , at the input scale @xmath18    @xmath19 + 1 } + { \\tilde a x^{\\tilde b } \\over \\exp(x/{\\bar x } ) + 1}\\ , ,   \\label{eq5 } \\\\ x \\bar u^{-}(x , q^2_0 ) & = & { \\bar a ( x_{0u}^{+})^{-1}x^{2b } \\over   \\exp[(x+x_{0u}^{+})/{\\bar x}]+1 } + { \\tilde a x^{\\tilde b } \\over   \\exp(x / { \\bar x } ) + 1 } \\ , , \\label{eq6}\\\\ x g(x , q^2_0 ) & = & { a_g x^{\\tilde b + 1 } \\over \\exp(x /{\\bar x } ) - 1 } \\label{eq7 } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and similar expressions for the other light quarks ( @xmath20 ) and their antiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed @xmath21 and the strange parton distributions @xmath22 and @xmath23 are simply related @xcite to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> a peculiar aspect of this approach , is that it solves the problem of desentangling the @xmath27 and @xmath28 contribution through the relationship @xcite @xmath29 and the corresponding one for the other light quarks and their antiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> it allows to get the @xmath30 and @xmath31 distributions from the ones for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    by performing a next - to - leading order qcd evolution of these parton distributions </S>",
    "<S> , we were able to obtain a good description of a large set of very precise data on @xmath34 and @xmath35 data , in correspondance with the _ eight _ free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> therefore crucial tests will be provided by measuring flavor and spin asymmetries for antiquarks , for which we expect @xcite @xmath36 @xmath37 the inequality @xmath38 has the right sign to agree with the defect in the gottfried sum rule @xcite and if eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) above is satisfied , it means that the antiquark polarization contributes to about @xmath39 to the bjorken sum rule @xcite , which is not negligible . for illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we show in figs . 1 and 2 , the predictions of the statistical approach with recent dis results .    = 3.5 in    we </S>",
    "<S> now briefly discuss an extension of this approach to construct the octet baryons fragmentation functions ( ff ) . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristics of the model are determined by using some data on the inclusive production of proton and @xmath40 in unpolarized deep inelastic scattering and a next - to - leading analysis of the available experimental data on the production of unpolarized octet baryons in @xmath41 annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the statistical features which were proposed to build up the nucleon pdf in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , can be used also to construct the ff for the octet baryons . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the parton ( @xmath42 ) to hadron ( @xmath43 ) ff @xmath44 , at an input energy scale @xmath45 , is proportional to    @xmath46 \\pm 1]^{-1}~ , \\label{1}\\ ] ]    where the _ plus _ sign for quarks and antiquarks , corresponds to a fermi - dirac distribution and the _ minus _ sign for gluons , corresponds to a bose - einstein distribution . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 is a constant which plays the role of the _ thermodynamical potential _ of the quark hadronization into a hadron and @xmath48 is the _ universal temperature _ , which is assumed to be equal for all octet baryons and it is reasonable to take its value to be the same as for the nucleon pdf . for more details the interested reader can go to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and here we just show our results for @xmath40 production , displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , for the energies @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , which covers a sizeable energy domain , that the scaling violations in this range are very small . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that both parton distributions and fragmentation functions are compatible with the statistical approach , in terms of a few free parameters . </S>"
