    "a quantum cascade laser ( qcl ) is a semiconductor laser with specially designed cascade quantum structure to realize unipolar carrier transport and intersubband optical transition , and thus to achieve long - wavelength lasing by overcoming the bandgap limit of the material  @xcite . since the first observation of the population inversion in a qcl  @xcite , the mid - infrared ,",
    "far - infrared and even thz qcl s have been realized though few of them operate at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the performances of the qcl s deteriorate with temperature quickly when the emission wave length gets longer , a signature of an increasingly detrimental thermal activation of non - radiative losses .",
    "therefore it is important to understand and control the non - radiative paths from the upper state of the lasing transition .",
    "a magnetic field @xmath0 applied parallel to the growth axis has been used as an external parameter to monitor the characteristic of a qcl . in particular , it modulates the output power of the laser with an oscillation period proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "this output is sensitive to both elastic and inelastic scatterings , which introduce non - radiative relaxation channels to carriers in the landau level ( ll )  @xcite .",
    "thus it is of interest to study theoretically the relaxation mechanisms of the qcl in the presence of a quantizing magnetic field .",
    "calculations of the lo phonon emission rates in these disordered systems have rarely been reported  @xcite . yet , in the @xmath2 active - region material the alloy effect nearly reaches its maximum value , with broadening of the ll up to several @xmath3s .",
    "therefore , it is worth devoting more efforts to the understanding whether the notion of phonon emission remains meaningful in ll quantized material .    assuming a ll structure at high magnetic field",
    ", the problem could be tackled in two radically different ways . in the weak electron - phonon coupling case ,",
    "the electron states are initially computed by including alloy scattering potentials and the phonon emission rates are then calculated using the fermi s golden rule .",
    "this traditional perturbative computation would give an estimate of the exponential decay rate of the upper level electron population .",
    "on the contrary , ll electrons and lo phonons form magneto - polaron states when their coupling is strong enough .",
    "similar effects appear recurrently in the optical properties of quantum dots ( qd s ) , @xmath4  @xcite . in this mixed mode description",
    "the electron - lo - phonon interaction is initially taken into account exactly .",
    "hence , the very notion of phonon scattering / emission becomes irrelevant .",
    "we shall examine the magneto - polaron case where the alloy scattering broadens the magneto - polaron states and compute the time - dependent survival probabilities in the upper ll s for an electron initially in one of the alloy broadened upper ll s .",
    "this electron - phonon strong coupling theory leads to a distinguishably different prediction for the carrier relaxation process as composed to the ordinary phonon emission picture , and predicts a nonexponential population decay from the upper levels .",
    "for mid - infrared qcl s , it is a reasonable assumption that the alloy scattering destroys neither the subband structure at zero field nor the ll structure at high magnetic fields .",
    "so we consider only a few subbands and their ll s .",
    "leuliet _ et al _ demonstrated that the alloy scattering effect in the barrier is negligible as compared to that in the well  @xcite .",
    "we correspondingly model the active region of a qcl as a single quantum well ( qw ) clad between infinite potential barriers along the @xmath5 direction .",
    "a uniform magnetic field applied parallel to the quantum confinement direction is considered in landau gauge ( with the vector potential @xmath6 ) .",

    "alloy scattering blurs the magneto - polaron states and it is interesting to ascertain the nature of the phonon emission in qcl subjected to a strong quantizing magnetic field . to this end , in the case of the @xmath73 resonance , we compute for a given realization of the alloy disorder the survival probability in the ensemble of independently broadened ll states @xmath111 related to @xmath18 once the carrier has been injected in one particular state @xmath112 of this ensemble : @xmath113 where @xmath114 . in the following ,",

    "several magnetic fields have been considered .    when there is a large energy detuning between the zero - lo - phonon replica of @xmath18 ll s and the one - lo - phonon replica of @xmath115 ll s , the survival probability very quickly oscillates between 1 ( t = 0 ) and @xmath116 to stabilize to @xmath117 in a characteristic time @xmath118 of a few picoseconds : if @xmath112 is the central state of the broadened ll s and for @xmath119 , we find @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "right at resonance @xmath67 , see fig .",
    "6 , the averaged survival probability displays a large number of fast oscillations ( pseudo period : @xmath122 ) with a decaying amplitude ( @xmath123 ) that brings @xmath124 to the limiting value @xmath125 .",
    "we note that the pseudo period is close to @xmath126 . the limiting value @xmath127 recalls the fact that the frhlich interaction being so efficient that the carrier very quickly exits from the initial state",
    ". however , once in the one - lo - phonon replica of the @xmath73 ll , there is no sink mechanism the electron can use to escape from this ll .",
    "thus , another frhlich interaction brings it back into the @xmath18 ll .",
    "there is no reason a priori for this state to be the same as the initial state .",
    "subsequently , the electron leaves the initial ll and oscillates back and forth between the zero - lo - phonon replica of @xmath18 ll s and the one - lo - phonon replica of @xmath115 ll s .",
    "this oscillatory cycle between the two broadened ll s is however irreversible to the extent that the initial state has very little chance to be recovered after @xmath128 jumps .",
    "this is in striking contrast with the coherent polaron oscillations that would result if there were no alloy scattering acting to blur the polaron states , thereby leading to an oscillatory cycle between only two polaron states .    the consequence on our understanding of the experimentally observed qcl oscillatory output versus @xmath0 is significant .",
    "unless one can find a plausible and fast escape mechanism from the one - lo - phonon replica , there is no reason to invoke an irreversible escape from the upper state of the lasing transition in a qcl .",
    "the long lived oscillations displayed in fig .",
    "6 will actually be limited by the finite lifetime of the phonons due to anharmonicity effects .",
    "this lifetime is about @xmath129 at low temperature and a few picoseconds at room temperature in bulk gaas .",
    "similar values were found in inas self organized qd s  @xcite . beyond this lifetime , on average , the oscillations should stop and the electron should have relaxed to one of the disorder broadened ll states @xmath90 with no phonon .",
    "note that such a relaxation path would be in complete contrast with bulk and qw materials at zero magnetic field but much in agreement with the energy relaxation scenario established in qd s  @xcite .",
    "the approximation of neglecting the uncoupled one - phonon states turns out unsatisfactory because of the very efficient alloy scattering between magneto - polarons and uncoupled one - phonon states . as a result ,",
    "the rabi oscillations due to polaron effects will be severely damped since the alloy scattering between polaron states and the large number of uncoupled one - phonon states will give fast additional leakage channels for the ll electrons .",

    "note also that these states are energetically placed between the two polaron levels @xmath130 : at their mid - distance at resonance @xmath135 and tend towards the fast increasing ( with field ) polaron branch at high detuning @xmath136 .",
    "the effect of alloy disorder is twofold : ( i ) broadening the uncoupled level and ( ii ) admixing the uncoupled with the polaron states .",
    "however , a full diagonalization , including all polaron and uncoupled one - phonon states with a large number of phonon modes , is too heavy numerically ( this would mean diagonalizing for each run of the @xmath33 a matrix of the size as @xmath137(n_{phonon}+1)\\right)^2\\ge ( 2.8\\times 10 ^ 4)^2}$ ] ) . in the following , we present estimates illustrating the importance of effects ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "an estimate of the effect is obtained by remarking that at the lowest order in @xmath138 it produces a shift of the polaron states which reads [ correct ] @xmath139 it is difficult to give a simplified analytical expression of @xmath140 like eqs .",
    "( 13 - 14 ) due to the large value of @xmath141 required . with the results of the numerical diagonalization as shown in fig .",
    "5(d ) , this shift is roughly @xmath142 at resonance @xmath143 , and the effect ( ii ) becomes very important at increasing detuning @xmath144 to the polaron branch whose @xmath145 tends towards @xmath146 . for increasing @xmath144",
    "it becomes necessary to take into account higher orders effects of @xmath138 , once the uncoupled one - phonon states enter the dos of the closer broadened polaron branch .",
    "thus it turns out to be extremely inefficient to handle the problem by making corrections to the scba eqs .",
    "( 10 - 11 ) .",
    "another way to evidence the importance of the coupling between the polaron and the unadmixed states consists in looking at the irreversible escape from one of the polaron states to the unadmixed states broadened by alloy scattering .",

    "our objective was to ascertain the accuracy of the weak coupling regime between electrons and lo phonons .",
    "our results show that the very notion of a fermi s golden rule is highly questionable in these structures because of the ll singular density of states .",
    "neither the static scatterers are weak enough nor the electrons and lo phonons form stable magneto - polarons . as a result",
    "the survival probability in the upper state of the lasing transition never decays exponentially to zero but displays a number of damped oscillations before stabilizing to @xmath127 , thereby evidencing that the magneto - polaron levels never completely empty . or , the static scatterers are efficient enough to wash out the polaron oscillations because it couples these polaron levels more efficiently to the huge reservoir of uncoupled one - lo - phonon states than to the polaron states . the survival probability in the upper state of the lasing transition decay to zero but not at all in an exponential fashion as would result from the fermi s golden rule",
    "instead , it first decays like in the damped polaron case and once has reached its first minimum practically never recovers .",
    "the complicated time evolution of the survival probability evidences the need of a more microscopic description to understand the physics of the non - radiative mechanisms in qcl s",
    ". it also warns against the estimated efficiency of the static scatterers or phonon scattering when it is based on oversimplified descriptions of the disorder on the qcl quantum states .",
