    "wire chamber detectors require readout electronics to amplify , shape , and digitize input signals from each wire , and digital circuitry to buffer and transmit the data .",
    "typically , these functions are performed using a combination of separate ics and discrete components .",
    "performing all these functions in a single ic would simplify and consolidate the readout process .",
    "use of high - density cmos processes can greatly reduce the per - channel size and power requirements of the readout electronics , which can be valuable for the high channel count detectors common in high energy physics ( hep ) experiments .",
    "dedicated asics for wire chamber signal amplification and shaping @xcite , pulse - height digitization @xcite , and time digitization @xcite have been previously developed .",
    "the asic developed for the babar experiment @xcite combined time and pulse - height digitization .",
    "these chips each required more than 50mw / channel , resulting in well over 100mw / channel for a full electronics chain .",
    "no single asic performs all the functions required for wire chamber signal processing and digitization .    in this report , we present the design and performance of a prototype asic digitizer that provides all the functionality required for wire chamber readout .",
    "each channel of the 4-channel prototype contains a preamplifier , a discriminator , two tdcs , and one adc , providing a full readout circuit for both ends of a single wire .",
    "in addition , each channel provides input and output buffers for digital and pre - amplified analog signals , which can be multiplexed into the digitization chain , allowing a variety of signal path configurations .",
    "the asic has a minimal digital backend to buffer and transmit the recorded data .",
    "this asic was developed as a prototype of the digitizer for the straw tracker of the mu2e experiment  @xcite .",
    "mu2e is a proposed experiment to search for charged lepton flavor violation in muon to electron conversion in the field of a nucleus .",
    "the mu2e tracker must measure the momentum of roughly @xmath0 electrons with a precision and accuracy better than @xmath1 to achieve its science goals .",
    "the tracker design includes approximately 20,000 straws , operating in vacuum inside a 1 t solenoid , and arranged in many overlapping layers , filling a roughly cylindrical volume 3 meters long by 1.4 meters in diameter . because of space limitations and thermal requirements",
    "specific to operating the detector in vacuum , the signal processing electronics must be compact and consume very low power .    to meet these requirements , we chose to implement our asic in 65 nm commercial cmos technology , which had not been previously used for hep applications . choosing this technology also reduced engineering costs , through sharing design resources with similar projects being developed at the same time .",
    "we use the acronym pom ( processor of muon decays ) to refer to our prototype asic , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pom_pic ] .",
    "the design concepts and functional blocks of pom are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : design ] .",
    "the performance of the blocks are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : performance ] .",
    "the tolerance of pom to neutron radiation , and power consumption measurements , are also described in sec .",
    "[ sec : performance ] .",
    "the pom prototype was developed to test the concept of a self - contained wire chamber digitizer , for the specific environment of the mu2e experiment .",
    "detailed simulations of the mu2e detector using geant4 @xcite as well as a complete implementation of the reconstruction and analysis chain were used to set specific requirements for pom , as summarized in table [ table : spec ] .",
    "many of the underlying requirements are not unique to mu2e , so pom could be useful for other applications in future .",
    "simulation studies show that efficient pattern recognition in mu2e requires localization of charge deposition in 3 dimensions  @xcite . as with all wire detectors ,",
    "the wire position , plus a measurement of the charge drift time , can determine the location of the charge deposition in the direction orthogonal to the wire .",
    "for the proposed mu2e gas ( ar / co@xmath2 80/20 ) , adequate transverse position resolution is obtained with @xmath3 drift time resolution .",
    "the position along the wire can be determined by comparing the signal arrival time at both ends of the wire .",
    "given typical values for the signal propagation time along the wire , a time difference resolution of @xmath450ps is required to achieve the required @xmath4 1 cm longitudinal position resolution .",
    "each pom channel provides drift time and time difference measurements using dual tdcs operating with a common clock .",
    "this allows pom to make precision time difference measurements without having to distribute fast clock signals over large distances .",
    "the mu2e environment produces many background particles , which can generate up to 1mhz of signals on a single wire . to maintain high efficiency",
    ", the electronics deadtime ( return to baseline ) must be less than 200ns .",
    "this implies a fast signal shaping time of roughly 20ns .",
    "mu2e simulation studies also show that distinguishing signals generated by electrons from those generated by protons or muons is needed to reduce backgrounds to acceptable levels .",
    "this separation can be achieved by measuring the energy deposition per unit length , which depends on particle species .",
    "pom provides a precise measurement of the energy deposition using an adc to digitize the wire current . to separate pulses from nearly concurrent particles ,",
    "multiple adc waveform samples are used . with a shaping time of  20ns",
    ", the optimum 2-pulse separation can be made using 8 samples taken at 50mhz sampling .",
    "the key design challenges to implement mixed - signal circuits in 65 nm are increased interconnect delay and increased susceptibility to crosstalk . to deal with the increased interconnect delay ,",
    "we paid special attention to the floor - planning , especially in the tdc which required the tightest timing . by minimizing the physical distance between communicating blocks and balancing the parasitics of matched lines , we were able to keep the timing skew under control .",
    "susceptibility to crosstalk can ideally be minimized by bypassing supplies on - chip , regulating low - noise supplies internally , and generating key reference voltages internally .",
    "the high cost of prototype production runs in 65 nm resulted in severe die area constraints , which forced voltage supplies and regulator off - chip , increasing the susceptibility of pom to crosstalk .",
    ".the design goals for pom [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : power ]      neutrons produced by the muon capture on the nucleus are the dominant radiation source expected for the mu2e tracker electronics",
    ". neutron scattering can deposit energy within the active volume of the cmos components , causing non - destructive state changes in the transistors ( single event upsets : seus ) .",
    "neutron capture followed by beta decay can transmute silicon to phosphorus , changing the doping and permanently damaging the circuit ( type inversion ) .",
    "based on detailed geant4 simulations @xcite , the total neutron dose at the location of the frontend electronics in mu2e is expected to be @xmath5 , integrated over 3 years .",
    "the adc occupies the largest area of the pom .",
    "the adc is also expected to have the largest sensitivity to the long - term neutron exposure ( total dose ) compared to the other pom components .",
    "we have tested the tolerance of the hippo adc @xcite , on which the pom adc design is based , to neutron irradiation at the mnrc reactor facility in mcclellan , ca .",
    "the reactor neutrons have a similar energy spectrum as those expected for mu2e .",
    "an unbiased hippo chip was exposed to the total integrated neutron dose of @xmath6 , which is 100 times larger than the expected total neutron dose for an adc in mu2e .",
    "the performance of the hippo adc after irradiation in terms of noise and linearity was found to be consistent with the pre - radiation performance , showing no degradation .",
    "triple - redundant circuitry was used in the configuration register of the pom to minimize the seu sensitivity , but not in the core adc and tdc or the data transmission buffers . an attempt to directly measure the seu rate of the pom in a neutron flux of approximately @xmath7 was inconclusive , as the ethernet signal driver chip on the test board failed after only a few seconds of radiation exposure .",
    "we developed and tested a prototype asic digitizer for integrated wire chamber readout in a single chip , implemented in 65 nm commercial cmos technology .",
    "the specifications targeted the requirements for the readout of the mu2e straw tracker .",
    "the prototype asic tdc was found to meet or exceed the design goals , in spite of a small rate of tdc outliers .",
    "the adc was found to meet the design goals only when operated in slower frequency , with some non - linearity effects .",
    "simple design changes should improve the tdc ring oscillator latching and the adc linearity .",
    "the discriminator , and therefore the analog signal operation mode of the asic , did not meet the design goals , due to clock - induced noise on the discriminator threshold .",
    "improved isolation should reduce this problem .",
    "the mu2e digitizer electronics requirements have changed since the pom prototype asic was designed ; in particular , increased cooling capacity has relaxed the power consumption requirement by an order of magnitude . the new requirements can be met by existing commercially available components ( adc and fpga ) .",
    "mu2e has consequently decided to implement the digitizer using commercial components , and no further development of the pom asic is foreseen .",
    "pom is one of the first asics developed for high energy physics in a 65 nm cmos process",
    ". this process will be valuable for future hep detector readout applications requiring compact circuits , low - power , reliability , and radiation hardness .",
    "the pom prototype showed that extremely low power consumption can only be achieved when precision matching of components is not required , or the effects of component mismatch can be corrected by calibration .",
    "it also showed that avoiding cross - talk in such extremely dense circuits requires careful isolation of analog signals , digital signals , power , ground , and reference inputs , both in the asic and its packaging .",
    "this material is based upon work supported by the us department of energy ( doe ) , office of science under contract numbers de - ac02 - 05ch11231 and de - ac02 - 07ch11359 .",
