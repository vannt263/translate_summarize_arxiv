    "a central question in understanding galaxy evolution is how primordial gas clouds first evolve into star - forming systems .",
    "there are good reasons to expect that gas which has never been associated with star - forming galaxies still exists in the universe today . in cold dark matter cosmologies , low - mass structures ( dark matter halos and baryonic matter ) are statistically the first to form .",
    "if the baryonic matter cools it will form bound clouds and structure formation proceeds hierarchically .",
    "the mass spectrum expected for primordial clouds is steep ( with the number varying with mass , @xmath4 , as @xmath5 ) , and if the smaller clouds do not all merge , or are disrupted , such clouds may be expected to survive to the present epoch .",
    "the most likely regions in which to find such primordial extragalactic clouds are in groups dominated by late - type galaxies , for several reasons .",
    "first , the collision rate in a galaxy group is expected to be lower than in a cluster , and therefore we might expect that low - mass clouds in galaxy groups have survived to the present day .",
    "second , it is observed that groups rich in elliptical galaxies often show extended x - ray emission ( as in centrally - condensed clusters ) , whereas groups dominated by late - type galaxies never show extended x - ray emission ( mulchaey et al .",
    "nath & chiba ( 1995 ) have suggested that this x - ray emitting gas has its origin in the disruption of low - mass , primordial clouds .",
    "this observation suggests that groups rich in late - type galaxies also contain a large mass of gas not associated with galaxies .",
    "if we interpret this lack of x - ray emission in groups dominated by late - type galaxies as evidence for the non - disruption of low - mass clouds , then provided the clouds exceed their virial temperature ( so that they have not collapsed to form stars ) , and are neutral , these clouds may be detectable .",
    "detections of intra - group atomic hydrogen which may be genuinely primordial are extremely limited , but some groups do show gaseous structures that are hard to explain as interaction products or outflows .",
    "these include , the m96 group ( schneider , saltpeter & terzian 1986 ) , around ngc 5291 ( malphrus et al.1997 ) , the environment of ngc 4532 ( hoffman et al .",
    "1999 ) , the virgo cluster ( davies et al .",
    "2004 , see also walter , skillman & brinks 2005 ) , and near local group dwarf galaxies ( bouchard , carignan & staveley - smith 2006 ) . the recent hipass survey has also revealed a small number of hi clouds with no optical counterparts although not specifically in groups ( e.g.  kilborn et al .  2000 , 2002 ; and also see doyle et al .",
    "several searches for low mass hi clouds in galaxy groups have resulted in non - detections down to thresholds as low as @xmath6 @xmath7 ( e.g.  zwaan & briggs 2000 ; zwaan 2001 ; dahlem , ehle & ryder , 2001 ; de blok et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "here we present giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ; see rao 2002 ) 21-cm observations to test whether ( primordial ) intra - group hi is common in groups which might in some sense be considered young .",
    "if the gas is cool and/or in low - mass clouds  as might be expected for a steep @xmath8 spectrum  then it is likely that a lower mass detection limit could be reached by searching for absorption rather than emission from the neutral gas .",
    "other searches for primordial hi have been , and indeed are being carried out , usually at high redshifts ( e.g.  bebbington 1986 ; wieringa , de bruyn & katgert 1992 ; taramopoulos , briggs & turnshek 1994 ; weintroub et al .",
    "1999 ) , but these have only probed for very massive primordial structures .",
    "a similar experiment to ours has been carried out by kanekar & chengalur ( 2003 ) with the gmrt , but this was aimed at detecting hi absorption towards damped lyman alpha systems ( see also kanekar & chengalur 2005 ) . details of our observations towards compact continuum sources behind groups of galaxies , which place strong limits on the existence of low - mass clouds in the local universe , are given in section  [ s : data ] , with the results and conclusions given in sections  [ s : results ] and [ s : conclusions ]",
    "to maximise our sensitivity to _ cool _ atomic gas , we search for hi in _ absorption _ towards background radio sources .",
    "our sample consists of seven groups ( from the catalogues of garcia 1993 and ramella , pisani & geller 1997 ) , as shown in table  [ t : sample ] .",
    "these satisfy the following criteria .",
    "( i ) the group is dominated by late - type galaxies .",
    "it is likely that such groups represent environments where fewer galaxy  galaxy interactions have taken place , and hence primordial gas is more likely to survive , and also such groups do not have x - ray emission which may originate from disrupted , low - mass primordial clouds .",
    "( ii ) the group is away from the galactic plane .",
    "( iii ) there is one ore more compact continuum source brighter than 60  mjy at 1.4  ghz visible in the nvss survey ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) close to the centre of the group , towards which 21-cm absorption measurements can be made . given the selected galaxy groups are nearby , with velocities less than @xmath9 km s@xmath0 , then it is reasonable to expect all the selected , compact nvss sources to be more distant than the groups .",
    "these fields were observed in two sessions with the gmrt , 2003 january 6th and 7th , and october 17th . each group was observed for between 1 and 2 hours each ( depending on scheduling constraints ) , with appropriate correlator frequency settings .",
    "the observations were made using 128 spectral channels , with a total bandwidth of usually 4  mhz , or in some cases 8  mhz ( e.g.  to allow two targets to be observed with the same reference velocity , to optimise calibration time , or for a group with a high velocity dispersion ) , giving channels of width 6.6 or 13.2 km s@xmath0 respectively .",
    "the data were observed at a fixed frequency , without doppler correction for diurnal variations , which is small for the duration of the observations compared with the individual channel width .",
    "independent right and left stokes parameter spectral data were recorded .",
    "bright , primary , calibrators 3c48 , 3c147 or 3c286 were observed for each of the velocity setting used .",
    "secondary calibrator sources close to each of the galaxy group were observed for @xmath10 min every @xmath11 min . during these observations",
    "typically 26 of the 30 antennas of the gmrt were available .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "our observations constrain the mean column density along the sight - line .",
    "using @xmath12 for velocities in km  s@xmath0 , then the limits from our observations smoothed to @xmath13 km  s@xmath0 , with typically a @xmath1 limit of @xmath14 , gives @xmath15 m@xmath3 , for a spin temperature of 100  k. this limit is five times smaller that the peak hi column densities detected in emission by walter et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , for the isolated hi cloud in the m81 group .",
    "we can use this limit on the hi column density to constrain the mass distribution of clouds in virial equilibrium in these galaxy groups . for a projected area of the continuum source at the galaxy group @xmath16 , and a line - of - sight through the group @xmath17 , then if the volume filling factor of hi clouds in the galaxy group is @xmath18",
    "then the volume of `` cloud '' we expect in our surveyed volume is , @xmath19 if the number density of hi in our clouds is @xmath20 and our column density limit is @xmath21 then ; @xmath22 now we can use the virial theorem to replace the dependence on @xmath23 for a dependence on @xmath24 , the cloud radius .",
    "the virial temperature is given by , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mean particle mass in units of @xmath27 ( i.e.  1 for pure hi ) .",
    "the cloud mass @xmath28 is simply @xmath29 which gives @xmath30 ( for all parameters in s.i",
    ".  units ) .",
    "taking @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , then @xmath33 substituting in eq .",
    "[ nhi ] for @xmath20 gives @xmath34 combining the observational constraint of eq .  [ col - den ] with eq .",
    "[ constraint ] the dependence on spin temperature is eliminated , giving @xmath35 or , for @xmath17 and @xmath24 are in units of pc , @xmath36 our ( @xmath1 ) limits of @xmath37 of , typically , @xmath38 in 20  km  s@xmath0 , for @xmath39  mpc , gives a statistical limit on @xmath40 of @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath42 then @xmath43  kpc , or for @xmath44 , @xmath45  pc ( although , of course , if the filling factor is low , a single line of sight may not , by chance , cross a cloud ) .",
    "the sense of the limit is that @xmath46 is less than that given in eq.[limit ] ( i.e.  for a given filling factor we constrain the lower limit for the cloud radius ) .",
    "as we have not considered a distribution of cloud sizes in this calculation @xmath24 in the above refers to the mean cloud radius .",
    "although the present observations provide useful constraints on any cool hi in the galaxy groups studied , the results are limited due to the small number of lines of sight probed .",
    "this is due to the low density on the sky of bright enough background continuum sources .",
    "however , for more sensitive telescopes ( e.g.  looking forward to the ska , see carilli & rawlings 2004 ) , then this technique of searching for hydrogen by absorption will gain in competitiveness compared to searches for emission , as it will be possible to probe many more lines of sight .",
    "any increase in sensitivity will correspondingly directly increase the detection sensitivity for emission constraints , whereas for absorption studies the improvement is not only in terms of the direct sensitivity to absorption towards any particular background source , but also the number of accessible lines of sight will be increased .",
    "consequently , the overall usefulness of constraints provided by absorption studies will increase more rapidly than for emission studies with more sensitive instruments ( see kanekar & briggs 2004 for further discussion ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "these gmrt observations provide additional constraints on the amount of cool hydrogen clouds that could exist along 8 lines of sight through 7 galaxy groups .",
    "although these results do not provide strong constraints on any _ cool _ hi in these galaxy groups , this method will , with the next generation of telescopes such as the ska , allow very many lines of sight to be probed in a given group .",
    "we thank the staff of the gmrt who have made these observations possible .",
    "the gmrt is run by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research , india .",
