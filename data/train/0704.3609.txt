    "this correlation suggests that dust emission at 4.5  is detectable in the star - forming late - type population , i.e. , galaxies with strong pah emission also show dust continuum emission at 4.5  .",
    "this is consistent with isophot spectroscopy : @xcite detected 4  dust emission from nearby spiral galaxies and suggested it arises from a dust component closely related to the pah .",
    "the same uv sources that heat pah molecules may also heat the dust that produces the excess 4.5  emission .",
    "dust emission at 4.5  is relatively unimportant for the least luminous galaxies , those with @xmath27_{\\rm abs}>-26 $ ] , despite the presence of 8  emission in a subset of the low - luminosity galaxies ( fig .",

    "the 8  number counts are strongly dominated by the late - type population : only 3% of the spectroscopic sample have early - type colors . even for the early - type - dominated galaxies , most of the 8  emission comes from dust rather than stellar light ( fig .",

    "the late - type galaxies are even more dominant in 8  luminosity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : cm8 ] .",
    "all the early - type galaxies have 8  absolute magnitudes at least three magnitudes fainter than the brightest late - type galaxies .",
    "there are many ways to estimate the galaxy luminosity function from survey data .",
    "when examining a new wavelength regime , a non - parametric method  one not assuming a specific functional form  is desirable because the true luminosity function may not follow a schechter or other typical distribution .",
    "for the present survey , where galaxy distances vary by a factor of ten , it is also better to avoid methods that are sensitive to possible galaxy clustering . @xcite and @xcite have presented detailed comparisons of many methods .",
    "we have computed the luminosity functions with both the familiar @xmath36 method @xcite and the @xcite c@xmath37  method .",
    "the c@xmath37  method does not require binning the data , thus avoiding the possible bias in @xmath36 found by @xcite , and it is insensitive to possible galaxy clustering .",
    "the results of the two methods are consistent .",
    "a further verification that large scale structure has little effect was to ignore data in narrow but heavily populated redshift ranges such as @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ f : color ] ) .",
    "the resulting luminosity functions do not change significantly .",
    "the luminosity functions have to be corrected for spectroscopic incompleteness in the sample . because this sample has spectra for nearly all galaxies ( table  1 , fig .",
    "[ f : redshift ] ) , the incompleteness correction has an insignificant effect on the results except in the faintest luminosity bins .",
    "this was checked by recomputing the luminosity function with two different incompleteness corrections .",
    "one method was to use only galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts but apply a weight to each one according to the reciprocal probability it would have been observed in the spectroscopic sample .",
    "the second method included all galaxies .",
    "galaxies were divided into bins based on @xmath35-[8.0]$ ] colors and @xmath27 $ ] magnitudes , and galaxies without redshifts were assigned the same redshift distribution as the galaxies with known redshifts in the same bin .",
    "the two methods give luminosity functions that are equal within the poisson uncertainties .",
    "the non - parametric 8.0  luminosity functions for various galaxy classes are shown in figure  [ f : lfdiff ] and tables  2 and  3 .",
    "as shown in this figure and also figure  [ f : cm8 ] , blue galaxies contribute little to the luminosity function and are rare for @xmath27_{\\rm abs}<-26 $ ] .",
    "agn are insignificant except in the brightest luminosity bins , where the uncertainties are large because few objects are in the survey .",
    "the luminosity function in the range @xmath40_{\\rm abs } \\la -22 $ ] is dominated by galaxies with significant dust contribution to the 8  flux .",
    "in addition to total luminosity , the observations allow us to measure the 8.0  pah ( dust ) luminosity alone .",
    "for each galaxy in the sample , the rest - frame 3.6  flux density was scaled by a factor of 0.227 ( an estimate of the stellar flux density at 8   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and subtracted from the rest - frame 8.0  flux density .",
    "this subtracts the starlight , leaving the pah flux density . because the subtraction is done on _ rest - frame _ flux densities , the procedure is equivalent to the two - component decomposition illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : color ] .",
    "after subtracting the continuum , galaxies with residual 8.0  magnitudes fainter than the limiting magnitude @xmath27=13.5 $ ] were excluded from the sample , and the luminosity function was re - calculated for the remaining galaxies to give a pah - only luminosity function .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ f : lfdiff ] and tables  2 and  3 .",
    "the uncertainties in the luminosity functions are set both by poisson statistics of the sample and by cosmic variance .",
    "the poisson uncertainties for the @xmath36 method are given in table  2 and statistical uncertainties for the @xmath41 method in table  3 .",
    "cosmic variance uncertainty can be estimated @xcite from the volume sampled plus an estimate of the galaxy two - point correlation function .",
    "this is not known directly for the 8  sample , but we assume it s the same as for optically - selected galaxy samples .",
    "( if anything , the correlation function is likely to be smaller for 8  -selected galaxies , which are predominantly late - type , than for optically - selected ones , more of which are early - type  @xcite .",
    "this will lead to less cosmic variance for an 8  -selected sample . ) in practice , a correlation function based on the fluctuation power spectrum from wmap-1 @xcite was extrapolated to the present via the method of @xcite then transformed via a spherical bessel function and smoothed with a 1  mpc radius .",
    "the volume integral ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * eq .  1 ) was then evaluated via a monte carlo approach .",
    "the resulting cosmic variance uncertainty is @xmath4215% in bins @xmath27_{\\rm abs}<-27.7 $ ] , where the survey samples the full volume of @xmath43 .",
    "this is a single uncertainty for the entire luminosity function , not an independent uncertainty in each bin . in the fainter bins",
    ", the uncertainty should in principle be larger , but the entire method is based on the assumption that the luminosity function is constant within the volume surveyed . in the faintest bin , for example , the survey magnitude limit corresponds to 135  mpc , and the data give no information whatsoever on the luminosity function outside this distance .",
    "density peaks in the sample are evident in figure  [ f : color ] but do not affect the derived luminosity function .",
    "as it turns out , a schechter function is an excellent fit to both the total 8.0  and the pah luminosity functions , as shown in figure  [ f : lfdiff ] .",
    "table  4 gives the best - fit parameters as found using the sty maximum likelihood method @xcite , and figure  [ f : ellipse ] shows the interdependence of the derived characteristic magnitudes @xmath44 emerging from the galaxy near 8  measured in units of the sun s bolometric luminosity . ] and faint - end slopes @xmath45 .",
    "the derived schechter exponents for the middle to faint end slopes are @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the slopes are similar to those found in the sloan @xmath48  band @xcite and the infrared @xmath33 band @xcite over a similar redshift range , though @xcite found a slightly shallower slope in @xmath48 .",
    "the steeper slope for the total luminosity shows that fainter galaxies tend to have relative less pah emission compared to their stellar emission ( though the slope uncertainties overlap at the 2@xmath24 level , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f : ellipse ] and table  4 ) .",
    "the inactive `` blue '' galaxies have just as steep a faint - end slope ( @xmath49 ) as the entire sample , in contrast to the result in blue light , where inactive galaxies show a much shallower faint - end slope @xcite . at the bright end , @xmath50 , there are no excess galaxy numbers above the schechter function prediction , in contrast to the results of @xcite for the iras 60  luminosity function .",
    "the high luminosity population , i.e. , lirgs and ulirgs , consists of galaxies with far - infrared color temperatures @xmath5136  k @xcite , characteristic of seyfert and starburst galaxies .",
    "our exclusion of agn in the 8.0  sample , which removed galaxies from the bright end of the luminosity function , does not explain why a schechter function can fit the remainder of the sample .",
    "integrating the luminosity functions over the whole sample gives the total 8  luminosity density in the local universe .",
    "the result is @xmath52  mpc@xmath5 for total 8  luminosity density ( not including agn ) , @xmath53  mpc@xmath5 for pah luminosity density , and a highly uncertain @xmath54  mpc@xmath5 for agn luminosity density .",
    "( the sample is too small to determine reliable agn numbers . )",
    "thus over the entire galaxy population , stellar emission contributes about 19% of the 8.0  luminosity while dust emission contributes 80% and agn roughly 1% .",
