    "the framework edges are the line segments @xmath5 $ ] associated with the edges of @xmath6 and these are viewed as inextensible bars .",
    "accounts of the analysis of infinitesimal flexibility and the combinatorial rigidity of such frameworks can be found in asimow and roth @xcite , @xcite and graver , servatius and servatius @xcite .    in the presence of a spatial symmetry group @xmath7 for @xmath2 , with isometric representation @xmath8 ,",
    "fowler and guest @xcite considered certain unitary representations @xmath9 and @xmath10 of @xmath7 on the finite dimensional vector spaces @xmath11 these spaces contain , respectively , the linear subspace of infinitesimal flexes of @xmath2 , denoted @xmath12 , and the linear subspace of infinitesimal self - stresses , @xmath13 .",
    "also @xmath14 contains the space @xmath15 of rigid motion flexes while @xmath16 is the space of infinitesimal mechanisms .",
    "it was shown , for @xmath17 , that for the induced representations @xmath18 and @xmath19 there is a relationship between the associated character lists .",
    "specifically , @xmath20-[{\\rho}_{\\rm str}]=[\\rho_{sp}]\\circ [ { \\rho}_n]-[\\rho_e]-[\\rho_{\\rm rig}]\\ ] ] where , for example , @xmath21 $ ] is the character list @xmath20=(tr({\\rho}_{\\rm mech}(g_1 ) ) , \\dots , tr({\\rho}_{\\rm mech}(g_n))),\\ ] ] for a fixed set of generators of @xmath7 , and where @xmath22\\circ [ { \\rho}_n]$ ] indicates entry - wise product .",
    "if there are no infinitesimal flexes or stresses for @xmath2 the fowler - guest formula can be viewed as a symmetry - adapted version of maxwell s counting rule for finite rigid frameworks . indeed , evaluating the formula at the identity element @xmath23 one recovers the more general maxwell - calladine formula , which in three dimensions takes the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the dimensions of the spaces of infinitesimal mechanisms and infinitesimal self - stresses , respectively .",
    "moreover it has been shown in a variety of studies that the character equation for individual symmetries can lead to useful symmetry - adapted counting conditions for rigidity and isostaticity ( stress - free rigidity ) .",
    "see , for example , connelly , guest , fowler , schulze and whiteley @xcite , fowler and guest @xcite , owen and power @xcite and schulze @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the notation above is taken from owen and power @xcite where symmetry equations were given for the rigidity matrix @xmath27 and a direct proof of the character equation obtained , together with a variety of applications .",
    "in particular a variant of the character equation was given for translationally periodic infinite frameworks and for strict periodicity .",
    "in the present development , which is self - contained , we combine the symmetry equation approach with a new derivation of the rigidity matrix , identified in borcea and streinu @xcite , which is associated with affinely periodic infinitesimal flexes . this derivation is given via infinite rigidity matrices and this perspective is well - positioned for the incorporation of space group symmetries . by involving such symmetries",
    "we obtain a general symmetry - adapted affine maxwell - calladine equation for periodic frameworks ( theorem [ t : mc ] ) and affine variants of the character list formula .    to be more precise , let @xmath0 be a countably infinite bar - joint framework in @xmath1 with discrete vertex set and with translational periodicity for a full rank subgroup @xmath28 of isometric translations .",
    "we refer to frameworks with this form of periodicity as crystal frameworks . an affinely periodic flex of @xmath0 is one that , roughly speaking , allows periodicity relative to an affine transformation of the ambient space , including contractions , global rotations and sheering .",
    "the continuous and infinitesimal forms of this are given in definition [ d : flexes ] and it is shown how the infinitesimal flexes of this type correspond to vectors in the null space of a finite rigidity matrix @xmath29 with @xmath30 rows and @xmath31 columns .",
    "here @xmath32 , a _ motif _ for @xmath0 , is a choice of a set @xmath33 of vertices and a set @xmath34 of edges whose translates partition the vertices and edges of @xmath0 .",
    "the `` extra '' @xmath35 columns correspond to the @xmath35 degrees of freedom present in an affine adjustment of the @xmath28-periodicity .",
    "when the affine adjustment matrices are restricted to a subspace @xmath36 there is an associated rigidity matrix and linear transformation , denoted @xmath37 . the case of strict",
    "periodicity corresponds to @xmath38 .",
    "the symmetry - adapted maxwell - calladine formulae for affinely periodic flexibility are derived from the symmetry equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are finite - dimensional representations of the space group @xmath42 . as we discuss in section 3",
    ", this in turn derives from the more evident symmetry equation for the infinite rigidity matrix @xmath43 by restriction to finite dimensional invariant subspaces .",
    "the infinite dimensional vector space transformation perspective for @xmath44 is also useful in the consideration of quite general infinitesimal flexes including local flexes , diminishing flexes , supercell periodic flexes and , more generally , phase - periodic flexes . in particular",
    "phase - periodic infinitesimal flexes for crystal frameworks are considered in @xcite in connection with the analysis of rigid unit modes ( rums ) in material crystals .",
    "see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several illustrative examples are discussed in section 4 , namely the well - known kagome framework , a framework suggested by a roman tiling of the plane , the framework @xmath45 formed by a regular network of triangular hexahedra , and a related infinite hexahedron tower .",
    "in addition to such curious `` mathematical '' frameworks there exist a profusion of `` natural '' polyhedral net frameworks which are suggested by the crystalline structure of natural materials , such as quartz , perovskite , and various aluminosilicates and zeolites .",
    "a few of these frameworks , such as the cubic form sodalite framework @xmath46 , ( @xcite , @xcite ) , have pure mathematical forms .",
    "see also the examples in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we note two recent interesting articles on periodic frameworks which also examine affinely periodic flexibility and rigidity and which provide further examples .",
    "ross , schulze and whiteley @xcite consider borcea - streinu style rigidity matrices and orbit rigidity matrices to obtain a counting predictor for infinitesimal motion in the presence of space symmetries of separable type . using this they derive the many counting conditions in two and three dimensions , arising from the type of separable space group in combination with the type of affine distortion space @xmath36 .",
    "we indicate how the orbit matrix approach of @xcite appears in our formalism .    in a more combinatorial vein malestein and theran @xcite consider a detailed combinatorial rigidity theory for periodic frameworks which are as generic as can be modulo translational peridicity .",
    "in particular they obtain combinatorial characterisations of periodic affine infinitesimal rigidity and isostaticity for such generic periodic frameworks in @xmath47 .",

    "for convenience suppose first that @xmath48 is equal to @xmath49 . the changes needed for the extension to @xmath50",

    "one might also view the motif as a choice of representatives for the translation equivalence classes of the vertices and the edges of @xmath0 .",
    "it is natural to take @xmath33 as the vertices of @xmath0 that lie in a distinguished _ unit cell _ , such as @xmath82 in the case that @xmath61 is the standard cubic translation group for @xmath83 .",
    "in this case one could take @xmath34 to consist of the edges lying in the unit cell together with some number of cell - spanning edges @xmath84 $ ] where @xmath85 is nonzero .",
    "this can be a convenient assumption and with it we may refer to @xmath86 as the _ exponent _ of the edge .",
    "the case of general motifs is discussed at the end of this section .",
    "while we focus on discrete full rank periodic bar - joint frameworks , which appear in many mathematical models in applications , we remark that there are , of course , other interesting forms of infinite frameworks with infinite spatial symmetry groups .",
    "in particular there is the class of _ cylinder frameworks _ in @xmath1 which are translationally periodic for a subgroup @xmath87 of a full rank translation group @xmath61 .",
    "see , for example , the two - dimensional strip frameworks of @xcite and the hexahedral tower in section 5 . on the other hand one can also consider infinite frameworks constrained to infinite surfaces and employ restricted framework rigidity theory @xcite .",
    "we now give definitions of affinely periodic infinitesimal displacement velocities and flexes starting with a matrix - data description and a connection with continuous flexes .",
    "this notation takes the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an arbitrary @xmath90 matrix and @xmath91 is a real vector in @xmath92 composed of the infinitesimal flex vectors @xmath93 that are assigned to the framework vertices @xmath94 .",
    "the matrix @xmath89 , an _ affine velocity matrix _ , is viewed both as a @xmath90 real matrix and as a vector in @xmath95 in which the columns of @xmath89 are written in order .",
