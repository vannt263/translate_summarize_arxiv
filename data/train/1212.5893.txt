    "the temperature of the universe at that epoch is estimated to be @xmath1 mev .",
    "similar state of matter is also expected to exist inside the core of super - massive stars in the present day universe , where the density is @xmath2 times that of normal nuclear matter .",

    "fortunately experimental facilities at cern ( france / switzerland ) , bnl ( usa ) and recently at gsi ( germany ) are exploring the possibilities of creating and studying the properties of such exotic states of matter in a controlled environment .",
    "the key differences that appear in such experiments as compared to the natural phenomenon are the lifetime of matter created in the exotic state and its volume . whereas in natural phenomenon",
    "the lifetime of the exotic matter may be large compared to the interaction time - scale , it is usually very small in an experimental situation .",

    "we shall discuss about the effects of finite volume on the properties of strongly interacting matter .",
    "in the following we shall generically define the matter with color confined states as the hadronic phase and the exotic state with colored degrees of freedom as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in the experiments",
    "this exotic phase may be produced by ultra relativistic collisions of heavy ions .",
    "the volume of the system thus created would depend on the nature of the colliding nuclei , the center of mass energy ( @xmath3 ) and the centrality of collision .",
    "once created , the system expands until the constituents are so far separated that their interaction ceases and they flow out as free streaming particles .",
    "the distribution of particles thus freezes out , except for some further decays to smaller particles .",
    "there have been a large number of efforts to estimate the system size at freeze - out for different @xmath3 and different centralities .",

    "in fact one can not even consider the whole fireball , which is an isolated system to be in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "one has to choose a proper rapidity interval to act as the system under consideration .",
    "therefore it becomes important to study how the various thermodynamic quantities in a strongly interacting matter depend on the volume of the system .",
    "specifically we know that finite system sizes would lead to smoothening of any singularities appearing at a phase transition  @xcite",

    "the decrease of scaled pressure with increasing volume may be a surprise given that the constituent quark masses were shown to decrease drastically with decreasing volume , which should imply increase in pressure .",

    "these two conditions somehow seem to keep the lowest available energy of the quark quasi - particles almost same for different volumes . thus the pressure does not increase with decreasing volume .",
    "however when plotted against @xmath70 it seems to decrease because the @xmath68 itself is smaller for smaller volumes , and therefore the pressure at the corresponding @xmath70 for smaller volume is smaller than that for a larger volume .",

    "let us now consider the quantity @xmath78 . in our mean field approach",
    "this is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor given by , @xmath79 . in a conformaly symmetric theory , for example a theory of free massless quarks and gluons the energy momentum tensor",

    "thus @xmath80 in that limit . in qcd",
    "however the conformal symmetry is broken due to non - zero quark masses as well as quantum anomalies as evident from the presence of a _ scale _ in the running coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "thus the energy - momentum tensor does not remain traceless .",
    "this was also found to be true in the pnjl model that have been reported in our earlier studies and compared with lqcd results  @xcite .",
    "the pnjl model is however not qcd and the reason for the scale symmetry breaking is the introduction of an ultraviolet cut - off in the njl part , a temperature scale @xmath81 in the polyakov loop part and of course a quark mass term similar to that in qcd .",
    "the physical implication of the two different scales in the quark and polyakov sector is to give rise to separate crossover temperatures for the two sectors . to compare quantities obtained in pnjl model against lqcd results one then averages out two crossover temperatures as done by us here in the last section .",

    "we find that with the change in volume , @xmath85 changes prominently up to the temperature corresponding to the crossover region . for smaller volumes",
    "the specific heat is smaller indicating a higher rise in temperature for the same rise in energy density .",

    "we found that a given amount of scaled energy density is obtained at a higher scaled temperature for a smaller volume .",
    "this can be of interest in heavy - ion collision experiments . a given energy density deposited in the finite volume",

    "this is also an indication of the restoration of chiral symmetry as @xmath114 is directly proportional to the divergence of the chiral current .",

    "[ fig_mass ] . at low temperatures",
    "the constituent quark masses decrease with decreasing volume .",

    "this is exactly what we find in our calculations and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.gmor ] .",
