    "the rare semileptonic decays with neutrinos in the final state are considered as excellent probes of new physics ( np ) as they are significantly suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) and their long - distance ( ld ) contributions are generally subleading . by contrast ,",
    "rare decays involving charged leptons in the final state often receive a substantial contribution from the photon penguin , which is not so effective at suppressing ld effects .",
    "recently , the theoretical precision of the sm predictions for the @xmath11 modes has been improved to below @xmath12 @xcite and already matches the expected sensitivity of a future super flavour factory @xcite .",
    "similarly , the theoretical precision achieved for the @xmath13 modes is now below 5% , excluding parametric uncertainties from the ckm matrix elements , and a correspondingly precise measurement is expected to come out of the next generation of kaon experiments at cern and j - parc ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    for all rare charged meson decays , there is a possible long - distance contribution arising at tree - level through an intermediate lepton state .",
    "such contributions are potentially large when the intermediate lepton is kinematically allowed to be on - shell , as can be seen in the case of @xmath14 by multiplying the measured branching ratios of @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath17 to be compared with the most precise sm prediction for the short - distance , fcnc - induced rate @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to analyze in detail such contributions for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 decays .",
    "first , however , we will review the situation for the @xmath3 decay where the intermediate lepton is never on - shell @xcite , as well as for the ld dominated @xmath21 and @xmath22 decays , for which such tree - level effects were only briefly considered previously @xcite .",
    "the tree - level contribution for @xmath23 proceeds through the leptonic decay @xmath24 followed by the transition @xmath25 , as depicted in fig .",
    "1 . a straightforward computation gives the differential decay rate for the decay chain @xmath26 $ ] as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are appropriate ckm elements ( which we take from the sm fit of ckmfitter @xcite in numerical applications ) , and the decay constants are defined from @xmath31 .",
    "the intermediate lepton width @xmath32 has to be accounted for to regulate the divergence when the lepton pole is inside the phase - space , and is introduced using the usual substitution @xmath33 .",
    "penguin fcnc process ( the @xmath34 box is understood ) contributing to the rare charged meson decays , shown for @xmath35 for definiteness.,width=302 ]    this contribution is formally of order @xmath36 , i.e. of the same weak order as the loop - level fcnc contributions ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . however , the @xmath37 penguin is dominated by the quadratic @xmath38 breaking , leading to an effective dimension - six operator , hence to an a priori larger contribution of @xmath39 to the total rate .",
    "this nave counting does not hold if the intermediate lepton can be on - shell , since the rate is then given to an excellent approximation by@xmath40 with @xmath32 of order @xmath41 , the tree - level contribution is of order @xmath41 and could become dominant .",
    "the relative strength of the tree and loop contributions is very different in the case of the @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 meson decays , and we will now discuss them in turn .",
    "since the @xmath24 process is helicity - suppressed , i.e. the amplitude is proportional to @xmath45 , one could think that the @xmath7 lepton would give the largest contribution , the two @xmath46 factors from the vertices cancelling the @xmath47 of the @xmath7 propagator .",
    "however , for off - shell @xmath7 , the helicity suppression is no longer effective : the @xmath7 momentum @xmath48 occurs instead of @xmath46 , and since @xmath49 , the amplitude is suppressed by @xmath50:@xmath51 this amplitude can be seen as deriving from an effective dimension - ten operator suppressed by @xmath52 .",
    "numerically , this leads to a tiny @xmath53 ( using pdg values for the masses and decay constants @xcite ) , to be compared to the sd contribution from the @xmath37 penguin and @xmath34 box of @xmath54 in the sm @xcite .",
    "the interference with the short - distance contribution is larger but still negligible , @xmath55 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the contributions from the light leptons are not suppressed by a large mass scale .",
    "these effects where considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with chiral loop corrections , and amount to a small correction usually incorporated in @xmath56 in the sm prediction for @xmath3 .",
    "the tree - level exchanges are thus much smaller than the sd contributions .",
    "in fact , even the residual up - quark contribution to the @xmath37 penguin gives a larger effect , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the gim suppression is very effective for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and makes their loop - level fcnc contributions extremely small .",
    "further , the @xmath37 penguin does not contribute to @xmath61 and @xmath5 . even including the ld contributions from vector mesons , the branching ratios for all these modes are tiny , typically below the @xmath62 level @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , compared to @xmath63 , the @xmath7 can now be on - shell and gives a large tree - level contribution .",
    "in fact , all the other contributions are so suppressed that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are used to measure the corresponding leptonic decays @xmath64 and @xmath65 , since eq .",
    "( [ rate1 ] ) can be written as @xmath66 the kaon modes are not used for such measurements since @xmath67 is cabibbo - suppressed , but could in principle be included as well since there are no other significant contributions to worry about .",
    "it should be mentioned also that not only the hadronic @xmath68 decay mode is looked for , but also purely leptonic decay channels .    , @xmath60 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 modes , with the horizontal lines denoting the position of the @xmath7 pole contribution .",

    "further , the kinematics of the final state neutrinos is not measured , and the dalitz plot of the @xmath69 three - body decays can not be reconstructed .",
    "a single kinematical variable , e.g. the invariant mass of the invisible particles @xmath70 alone ( which is related to the @xmath71 momentum ) , can not always be used cut away the @xmath7 pole contributions since the @xmath7 exchange proceeds in the annihilation channel , which needs to be integrated over . for @xmath43 decays , however , there is not much phase - space available for creating an on - shell @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and thus one could in principle disentangle the non - resonant contributions by restricting @xmath70 to large values ( or equivalently , discarding events with a large @xmath72 or @xmath73 momentum ) .",
    "for instance , if it is restricted to @xmath74 with@xmath75 the @xmath7 pole contribution is completely discarded .",

    "the situation for @xmath44 decays is intermediate between that for @xmath13 ( full sd dominance ) and for @xmath81 ( full @xmath7 pole dominance ) .",

    "@xcite , rescaled when needed to account for the @xmath83 and @xmath6 lifetime difference , except for the pion mode which is estimated simply by rescaling @xmath84 by @xmath85 and correcting for the larger phase - space . for @xmath86 ,",
    "the differential rate from the @xmath7 pole is , using @xmath87 with the qcd sum rules value @xmath88 mev @xcite,@xmath89 in principle , there could be a sizable interference between the sd and ld contributions .",
    "however , the @xmath7 resonance is extremely narrow and often completely contained inside the dalitz plot .",
    "when integrating over the @xmath48 variable , the sd part is fairly flat , with no appreciable phase shifts compared to the ld part .",
    "therefore the resonance phase shift around the @xmath7 pole integrates the interference contribution almost to zero ( it is of the order of @xmath90 for @xmath91 ) .",
    "because the rare @xmath92 decay modes can be used either to measure @xmath93 or to probe fcnc transitions , one has to decide how to deal with them on a case - by - case basis .",
    "experimentally , the mode @xmath94 has been observed and used to extract the @xmath8 rate .",
    "this appears to be safe since compared to @xmath95 , the sd amplitude is cabibbo - suppressed while the tree - level amplitude is cabibbo - favoured , resulting in a relative enhancement of ld with respect to sd by a factor @xmath96 .",
    "however , note that the @xmath7 pole contribution is only about @xmath97 of the total @xmath94 rate in the sm . if the sd piece were enhanced by np contributions , it would show up as a discrepancy between the @xmath98 measured using @xmath68 and other @xmath7 decay channels like @xmath99 or @xmath100 where there is no issue of entanglement with a sd contribution ( still , the number of final state neutrinos is not measured so processes with identical charged leptons and hadrons but different numbers of neutrinos may be difficult to disentangle experimentally ) .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath101 modes should not be used to measure the @xmath8 rate .",
    "in fact , one would rather want to remove the @xmath7 contribution as it is obscuring the interesting short - distance physics , and potential signals of np .",
    "this is however difficult .",
    "compared to the @xmath43 decays discussed in the previous section , there is no way to cut away the @xmath7 pole contribution using the invisible invariant mass @xmath70 in @xmath11 decays , as can be seen from fig .",
    "the best one can do is to cut away the low @xmath70 region ( or high @xmath102 momentum ) where the @xmath7 pole effect is the strongest , but a sizeable residual @xmath7 contribution is unavoidable .",
    "( denoted simply by the @xmath103 invariant mass @xmath104 ) with that where the @xmath7 can be on - shell , as a function of the total invariant mass @xmath105 of the visible decay products @xmath106.,width=340 ]    the kinematical configurations of the @xmath101 decays are actually the worst possible to disentangle the sd and ld contributions . in fig . 3",
    "is shown the maximal kinematically allowed @xmath70 together with @xmath79 of eq .",
    "( [ qcut ] ) for a generic @xmath107 decay , as a function of the invariant mass of the @xmath106 state .",
    "it is only when this invariant mass is sufficiently large that the @xmath7 pole contribution can be cut away while still leaving a significant portion of phase - space to probe the sd contribution . in the extreme situation where the @xmath106 invariant mass is larger than @xmath46",
    ", the @xmath7 can never be on - shell and its contribution is negligible .",
    "of course , for such a large invariant mass , experimentally reconstructing the decay is probably too difficult , while the sd contribution is significantly suppressed by the smaller matrix elements for @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the feasibility of this strategy remains to be seen , and for the time being , the @xmath7 pole contribution has to be considered as an irreducible background when probing the fcnc transition @xmath10 with charged @xmath44 decays .",
    "transition with @xmath109 for which the @xmath7 can never be on - shell . with a branching ratio around @xmath110 @xcite , the non - resonant @xmath7 contribution can be safely neglected . ]",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that the @xmath7 pole contribution suffers from significant parametric uncertainties due to our poor knowledge of @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "fortunately , this uncertainty can be reduced in the sm by normalizing the effect to the neutral @xmath44 meson mass difference @xmath113 and using the corresponding hadronic bag parameter from the lattice instead of the decay constant @xcite .",
    "the relation is however not universal in presence of np , therefore we do not apply it here . instead ,",
    "in view of future improvements in the determination of @xmath114 and @xmath112 , in particular from the @xmath115 mode , we give parametric formulas for the ld contributions to @xmath35 :    @xmath116",
    "in this letter , we have performed a systematic study of the tree - level processes contributing to the rare exclusive semi - leptonic decays of the charged @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 mesons into a neutrino pair .",
    "our main result is that the contributions of the decay chains @xmath117 $ ] are large , about 15% of the corresponding sm short - distance fcnc contributions from which they can not be disentangled .",
    "these effects must be included in the sm predictions , which we have updated accordingly .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath118 is dominated by the @xmath7 lepton pole , with the sd contribution being of about 3% . as this mode",
    "is used to extract the @xmath8 rate , this pollution by sd physics should be kept in mind in case new physics turns out to be significant in @xmath9 transitions .",
