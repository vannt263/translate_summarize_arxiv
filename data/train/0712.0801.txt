    "elastic objects in disordered media are a fruitful concept to study diverse physical systems such as domain walls in ferromagnets,@xcite charge density waves in solids ( cdw),@xcite and vortices in type - ii superconductors.@xcite in all these systems , the interplay between elasticity , which tends to keep the object ordered ( flat or periodic ) , and disorder , which induces distortions , produces a complicated energy landscape.@xcite this leads to rich glassy behavior . for instance , at low temperature , weak defects in a crystal of type - ii superconductor , such as oxygen vacancies , can collectively pin the flux lines in the so - called bragg glass state.@xcite vortex pinning prevents the dissipation of energy , and thus , its understanding has a great importance for applications .",
    "it was observed in experiments that columnar defects produced in the underlying lattice of superconductors by heavy ion irradiation can significantly enhance vortex pinning .",
    "@xcite nelson and vinokur@xcite mapped the problem of flux lines pinned by columnar defects onto the quantum problem of bosons with uncorrelated quenched disorder in one dimension less .",
    "the mapping predicts a low temperature  strong \" bose - glass phase which corresponds to the localization of bosons in a random potential provided the longitudinal applied field @xmath8 is weak enough to create vortices with density smaller than the density of pins . for larger @xmath8 ,",
    "the bose - glass can coexist with a resistive liquid of interstitial vortices which , it is argued , can freeze upon cooling into a collectively pinned weak bose - glass phase .",
    "@xcite at low tilts of the applied magnetic field relative to the parallel columnar defects , flux lines remain localized along the defects , so that vortices are characterized by an infinite tilt modulus .",
    "this phenomenon which is known as the transverse meissner effect has been extensively studied experimentally.@xcite vortices undergo a delocalization transition to a flux liquid state at some finite critical mismatch angle @xmath9 between the applied field and the direction of defect alignment , i.e. , at some finite transverse field @xmath10 . the schematic phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - meissner ] .",
    "the breakdown of the transverse meissner effect above @xmath10 can be described by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the transverse magnetic induction due to the tilted flux lines .",
    "heuristic arguments of ref .   based on kink statistics predict @xmath13 in @xmath14 dimensions and @xmath15 in @xmath16 .",
    "however , experiments on a bulk superconductor ( @xmath17 ) with columnar disorder find @xmath18,@xcite while the strong - randomness real - space renormalization group suggests @xmath19 in @xmath20,@xcite that is in disagreement with the predictions based on kink statistics .",
    "thus , further investigations are needed .",
    "the theoretical advances for elastic objects in disordered media are achieved by developing two general methods : the gaussian variational approximation ( gva ) and the functional renormalization group ( frg ) .",
    "gva relies on the replica method allowing for the replica symmetry breaking.@xcite it is exact in the mean field limit , i.e. , in the limit of a large number of components .",
    "frg is a perturbative renormalization group method which is able to handle infinite number of relevant operator.@xcite simple scaling arguments show that the large - scale properties of a @xmath21-dimensional elastic system are governed by uncorrelated disorder in @xmath22 . in particular , displacements grow unboundedly with distance , resulting in a roughness of interfaces or distortions of periodic structures .",
    "the problem is notably difficult due to the so - called dimensional reduction which states that a @xmath21-dimensional disordered system at zero temperature is equivalent to all orders in perturbation theory to a pure system in @xmath23 dimensions at finite temperature .",
    "however , metastability renders the zero - temperature perturbation theory useless : it breaks down on scales larger than the so - called larkin length .",
    "@xcite the peculiarity of the problem is that for @xmath24 there is an infinite set of relevant operators .",
    "they can be parametrized by a function which is nothing but the disorder correlator .",
    "the renormalized disorder correlator becomes a nonanalytic function beyond the larkin scale .",
    "@xcite the appearance of a nonanalyticity in the form of a cusp at the origin is related to metastability , and nicely accounts for the generation of a threshold force at the depinning transition.@xcite it was recently shown that frg can unambiguously be extended to higher loop order so that the underlining nonanalytic field theory is probably renormalizable to all orders .",
    "@xcite although the two methods , gva and frg , are very different , they provide a fairly consistent picture and recently a relation between them was established.@xcite there is also good agreement with results of numerical simulations , not only for critical exponents @xcite but also for distributions of observables@xcite and the effective action.@xcite     parallel to the columns as a function of transverse field @xmath25 and temperature @xmath26 .",
    "the bose glass corresponds to vortex localization and exhibits a transverse meissner effect .",
    "the transition to liquid phase occurs at the critical field @xmath27 . in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions ,",
    "the temperatures @xmath28 and @xmath29 are related to the special values of the luttinger interaction parameter : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the inset shows the response to a transverse field in the vicinity of transition.,width=192 ]    the frg techniques were also applied to pinning of elastic systems by columnar disorder.@xcite the models studied by frg , though that may be more directly applicable to systems such as charge density waves or domain walls , exhibit many features of the bose - glass phase of type - ii superconductors .",
    "in particular , they demonstrate the absence of a response to a weak transverse field and provide a way to compute the exponent @xmath32.@xcite however , since frg intrinsically assumes collective pinning , it also predicts a slow algebraic decay of translational order , that is not expected in the strong bose - glass state when each vortex is pinned by a single columnar pin .",
    "thus , the frg is able to handle only a weak bose - glass phase , exhibiting both the transverse meissner effects and the bragg peaks .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the frg studies to two - loop order .",
    "we also extend to two - loop order our recent work@xcite on the elastic objects in the presence of long - range ( lr ) correlated disorder with correlations decaying with distance as a power law .",
    "this type of disorder can be induced , for example , by the presence of extended defects with random orientations . in particular , we address the question of the response to a tilting field and compare the effects produced by different types of disorder correlations .",
