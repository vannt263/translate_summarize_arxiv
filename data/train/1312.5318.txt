    ". however , in this case only severe upper limits on lfv branching ratios , such as those for @xmath3 @xcite or @xmath4 @xcite , exist .",
    "many neutrino mass models typically predict sizeable and well measurable effects in this sector . widely studied examples are supersymmetric variants of high - scale seesaw models @xcite , see , e.g.  @xcite . in these kinds of models ,",
    "the flavor violation in the neutral sector is transmitted to the charged sector in the renormalization group evolution from the high scale where the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking parameters are specified to the low scale @xcite . a generic prediction for the radiative decay @xmath5 reads  @xcite @xmath6 here @xmath7 parametrizes the largest off - diagonal elements of the soft - breaking slepton mass matrices and @xmath8 is the typical mass of the supersymmetric particles , nowadays expected to lie in the tev range .",
    "if one does not rely on special cancellations , usually small off - diagonal elements are required to satisfy experimental bounds @xcite . since in high - scale seesaw models",
    "the photonic penguin contributions dominate also the decay @xmath9 a simple relation between both observables exists @xcite @xmath10 therefore , the radiative decay @xmath5 is in general more constraining than @xmath11 ( up to some exceptions @xcite ) .",
    "recently , low - scale seesaw scenarios ( such as the inverse seesaw ) have gained more interest . in the inverse seesaw",
    "@xcite , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) particle content is extended by three generations of right - handed neutrino superfields @xmath12 and of gauge singlets @xmath13 , which carry lepton number .",
    "the superpotential reads @xmath14 after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , the effective mass matrix for the light neutrinos is approximately given by @xmath15 .",
    "the additional suppression given by @xmath16 allows for yukawa couplings of order @xmath17 and @xmath18 while being compatible with neutrino oscillation data .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : relation ] ) was found to be violated in the inverse seesaw due to a large enhancement of the @xmath2-penguins .",
    "these contributions , enhanced with respect to photonic penguins by a factor @xmath19 , turned out to be dominant in most parts of parameter space , specially in case of large @xmath20 . later , this qualitative result was further exploited in several phenomenological studies @xcite - penguin dominance was found for a specific choice of msugra parameters . ] .",
    "furthermore , this enhancement in the @xmath2-penguins was interpreted sometimes as a nondecoupling behavior .",
    "this nondecoupling behavior would imply the existence of a flavor violating @xmath21 operator without any suppression from the new physics scale @xmath22 .",
    "in an expansion in powers of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the electroweak vev , this operator would contain a nonvanishing zero order contribution .",
    "this is , however , absent in well - known lists of allowed effective operators @xcite as it would introduce an explicit violation of the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "therefore a critical discussion of this effect becomes necessary .",
    "while most previous works @xcite have adapted well established results of the mssm @xcite , we perform here a completely independent calculation of the @xmath2-penguin contributions to @xmath25 and @xmath26 conversion .",
    "we find that the @xmath2-penguins do not show the dominant behavior reported in  @xcite .",
    "the reason stems from a mistake in the @xmath2-penguin contributions already present in the mssm results of ref .  @xcite . while the mistake in the prediction of charged lfv rates has no impact in the case of high - scale seesaw models , for low - scale seesaw models it changes the entire picture .",
    "we present in the next section our revised calculation of the @xmath2-penguin , which contributes to several lfv observables , and point out the difference to previous calculations in the literature .",
    "afterward we numerically compare the old and new results before we conclude . in the appendix",
    "we provide the vertices and loop functions that are used in the computation .",
    "lfv violating observables have been intensively discussed in supersymmetric high - scale seesaw models @xcite . in view of the above - mentioned controversy , we focus on the @xmath2-penguin and , in particular , on the chargino - sneutrino contributions .",
    "we consider the definition of the effective @xmath27 vertex @xmath28 the form factors @xmath29 contribute to several lfv processes , among which one can find @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath26 conversion in nuclei @xcite and @xmath30 mesonic lfv decays @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the chargino contributions to the form factor @xmath31 are found to be    @xmath32    where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 couplings , respectively . for detailed definitions",

    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are loop functions evaluated in the limit of zero external momenta . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are well - known passarino - veltman functions , whereas combining the definitions in @xcite and @xcite @xmath43 is given by @xmath44    it proves convenient to expand @xmath45 in powers of the chargino mixing angle .",
    "this allows one to get a clear understanding of the leading contributions .",

    "@xmath47 represents the pure wino contribution and @xmath48 the pure higgsino contribution . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , using this method ( and the results for the loop functions in @xcite ) one can show that the contribution for a pure wino and a pure left - handed sneutrino vanishes exactly in the mssm .",
    "these equations can be easily adjusted to the inverse seesaw  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the contribution from the pure wino and pure left - handed sneutrino vanishes again , as in the mssm .",

    "we note that the majorana mass terms in the neutrino sector also induce a splitting of the sneutrinos into their scalar and pseudoscalar components . while this splitting has to be tiny for left sneutrinos @xcite it can be quite sizable for the gauge singlets .",
    "as this can lead in principle to visible effects we include it in the following discussion .",

    "the sneutrino mass @xmath66 corresponds to the respective cp - state , with the index @xmath67 covering all mass eigenstates .",
    "sums over repeated indices are implicitly understood and @xmath68 . in the limit of zero chargino mixing",
    ", i.e. for @xmath63 and @xmath62 being identity matrices , the expression simplifies to @xmath69 if the left and right sneutrinos do not mix among each other , @xmath70 reduces to @xmath71 using the explicit expressions for the loop functions ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , one can immediately see that the term in the brackets vanishes .",
    "we can compare this expression with the nonvanishing one of ref .",
    "@xcite by again using eq .",
    "( [ eq : eberl ] ) .",
    "one obtains    @xmath72    our result differs by a mass independent term of @xmath73 from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which leads to the disappearance of the nondecoupling contribution can be traced back to the part @xmath74 which was wrongly taken to be @xmath75 in @xcite . ] .",
    "finally , the results for the pure wino contribution read @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 both vanish if there is no left - right mixing among the sneutrinos and no mass splitting of the cp - even and cp - odd sneutrino states ( i.e. , in the mssm limit ) . notice that @xmath77 and @xmath78 vanish because of an exact cancellation of the two combinations of loop functions .",
    "in contrast , the expressions in refs . @xcite only vanish for flavor changing transitions ( due to the unitarity of the sneutrino mixing matrix ) , but still contain nonzero diagonal entries in the mssm limit , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath77 again differs by a constant term , analogously to @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath78 is the same as in @xcite but vanishes due to the usage of @xmath54 instead of @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , although the conclusion is the same , the cancellations in the off - diagonal wino contributions have different origins .",
    "chargino mixing , of course , spoils all of these cancellations and @xmath82 depend on the details of the sneutrino mixing matrix such as left - right mixing , left - left mixing as well as a mass splitting of the cp - even and cp - odd sneutrinos .",
    "note that the mass splitting of the distinct cp eigenstates could in principle give large effects in the amplitudes .",
    "however , in practice it can safely be neglected since it is tightly constrained by neutrino data to be very small @xcite .",
    "for the numerical study of our new analytical results , we have created a spheno @xcite version for the inverse seesaw using a modified version of sarah @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the yukawa couplings @xmath83 according to  @xcite : @xmath84 using the data from the global fit of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xcite is diagonal and the lightest neutrino eigenstate massless . ] .    in the following discussion we set for the sake of illustration all the slepton soft susy breaking masses to @xmath8 .",
    "the soft susy breaking gaugino masses are scaled as @xmath8 and their starting values are @xmath85  gev and @xmath86  gev .",
    "the @xmath87-parameters in the slepton sector are set to 130 gev .",
    "moreover , we set @xmath88 and @xmath89  tev .",
    "the neutrino data are reproduced by adjusting @xmath16 .",
    "it is clear that the chargino mixing drops as @xmath90 since both @xmath91 and @xmath92 are approximately linearly dependent on the susy scale . at tree level ,",
    "the mixing between @xmath93 and @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 such that the left - right mixing matrix entry @xmath96 also scales approximately like @xmath90 .",
    "it immediately follows that all mixing effects will decouple as @xmath97 since at least two mixing insertions are necessary .",
    "note that left - left mixing can enhance the amplitude , but has no impact on the qualitative behavior of the decoupling with large susy masses .     with increasing susy scale @xmath8 but fixed @xmath89  gev .",
    "the dashed black line shows br@xmath98 , the dotted red line the contribution from the photon penguin only whereas the full black line gives the chargino - sneutrino contribution to the @xmath2 penguin .",
    "the other parameters are fixed as explained in the text .",
    "the blue line shows the experimental upper limit of @xmath99 @xcite . ]     with increasing @xmath20 while @xmath8 has been fixed to 1  tev .",
    "the black full line depicts the contribution of the chargino - sneutrino loop to the @xmath2-penguin whereas the red dotted and the black dashed line show the contribution from the photon penguin and the full branching ratio .",
    "the blue line shows the experimental upper limit of @xmath99 @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : decouplingbehaviormsusy ] we show br(@xmath100 , the corresponding photonic contribution as well as the @xmath101-@xmath102 contributions as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "as can be seen , we obtain the expected decoupling of the susy contributions . thus ,",
    "in contrast to , e.g. @xcite , where a nondecoupling behavior due to a @xmath103 enhancement of the @xmath2-penguins with respect to the @xmath104-penguins was found , we do find the same decoupling behavior of both contributions for large susy scales .",
    "the reason why br(@xmath100 as well as the photonic contribution are practically constant for @xmath105  tev is the @xmath106-@xmath107 non - susy contribution .",
    "we therefore show in fig .",
    "[ fig : decouplingbehaviormr ] the same quantities as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "we can clearly see that one approaches the mssm limit for @xmath108  tev . in this case",
    "the right ( s)neutrinos decouple and only the higgsino diagram will vanish completely whereas the wino diagram can still give a large contribution due to possible chargino and sneutrino left - left mixings .",

    "@xcite did not consider higgsino contributions to the @xmath2-penguins and ref .",

    "@xcite claimed afterwards to agree with our results @xcite .",
    "we have shown that some recent lfv results in supersymmetric low - scale seesaw models are based on wrong analytical expressions for the @xmath2-penguins contributing to @xmath11 , @xmath26 conversion in nuclei as well as @xmath30 mesonic lfv decays .",
    "in fact , this affects not only the results for inverse seesaw models ( or other models with large superpotential couplings like trilinear @xmath109-parity violation @xcite ) , but also studies for models that lead to the mssm at low energies  @xcite",
    ". however , in the latter case the numerical impact on the lfv violating processes is negligible since the critical contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : abada ] ) ( induced by light right sneutrinos ) is not present .",
    "in contrast , the analytical error has a dramatic impact on low - scale seesaw models , whose phenomenology must be carefully revised . in order to do that",
    ", an independent calculation of all other contributions to the considered observables is required .",
    "given the interesting new results for the box contributions to these observables @xcite , it would be worth confirming by an independent calculation the potential dominance for @xmath106-@xmath110 boxes in the inverse seesaw in case of low @xmath20",

    "<S> there have been some recent claims in the literature about large right - handed sneutrinos contributions to lepton flavor violating observables like @xmath0 or @xmath1 conversion in nuclei in supersymmetric low - scale seesaw models . </S>",
    "<S> these large contributions originate from @xmath2-penguin diagrams which show a much weaker dependence on the heavy masses than the photonic contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we have traced this to an error in the evaluation of the corresponding loop amplitudes which has propagated in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly show that after correcting this mistake the @xmath2-penguins show the expected decoupling behavior . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the reported dominance of the @xmath2-penguin over the photonic contributions disappears as well . </S>"
