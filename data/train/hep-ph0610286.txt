    "<S> a particle @xmath0 coupling to two photons couples also radiatively to charged particles , like protons . </S>",
    "<S> if the particle is a light scalar this induced coupling leads to spin - independent non - newtonian forces . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the experimental constraints on exotic , fifth - type forces lead to stringent constraints on the @xmath1 coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the impact on the recent pvlas results and the role of paraphoton models introduced to solve the pvlas - cast puzzle .    </S>",
    "<S> spinless light particles are a common prediction of many theories that go beyond the standard @xmath2 gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> probably the most famous of them is the axion @xcite , an unavoidable consequence of the introduction of a new global @xmath3 symmetry designed to solve the qcd cp - problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are other examples of light particles ; some are pseudoscalar like the axion itself and some are scalar particles . </S>",
    "<S> we call them axionlike particles ( alps ) </S>",
    "<S> .    in general , a spinless particle couples to two photons , and of course in principle it has also couplings to matter . </S>",
    "<S> but the @xmath4 coupling is particularly interesting because many experimental searches for alps are based on it . </S>",
    "<S> one of these searches is based on the so - called haloscope @xcite , where axions or some other similar particles forming part of the dark matter in the galactic halo can convert into photons in a cavity with a strong magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> another search is to look for alps produced in the sun converting into photons in a detector having a strong magnetic field ; this is called helioscope @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still another experiment searching for alps and that uses the @xmath4 coupling looks for optical dichroism and birrefrigency in a laser that propagates in a magnetic field @xcite .    while the most recent haloscope @xcite and helioscope @xcite experiments have not found any signal and </S>",
    "<S> thus have put limits on model parameters , the third type of experiment described above has reported a positive signal . indeed , the pvlas collaboration finds a rotation of the polarization plane of the laser as well as an induced ellipticity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is an exciting interpretation of these results in terms of a new scalar particle @xmath0 , that should have a mass @xmath5 ev and a @xmath1 coupling scale of about @xmath6 gev -see equation ( [ lone ] ) below for the definition of @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to show that in the case that the particle @xmath0 is indeed a light * scalar * , the @xmath1 coupling leads to the existence of long - range spin - independent non - newtonian forces . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation will allow us to find a very stringent limit on the coupling , using the experimental null results coming from searches for new forces .    </S>",
    "<S> a scalar particle couples to two photons with the lagrangian @xmath8 the key point is that ( [ lone ] ) induces radiatively a coupling to charged particles , for example to protons ( see fig 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the induced coupling will have the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the proton field and @xmath11 the yukawa coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the loop diagram is logarithmically divergent .    in order to treat physically this divergence </S>",
    "<S> , we notice that ( [ lone ] ) corresponds to a non - renormalizable term in the lagrangian and as such is expected to be valid only up to a high - energy scale @xmath12 , where new physics has to appear . </S>",
    "<S> we integrate momenta in the loop of fig.1 only until @xmath12 , so that we cut the divergence with the scale @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmically divergent part of the diagram of fig.1 is well - defined and is the leading radiative contribution to @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> approximating @xmath11 by this term we obtain @xmath13    in principle there is also a tree level yukawa term ( [ ltwo ] ) in the theory , and there could be some cancelation between the tree level and the radiatively induced coupling ( [ y ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we regard this possibility as very unnatural , and will use ( [ y ] ) for our estimates .     </S>",
    "<S> +    the yukawa coupling ( [ ltwo ] ) leads to non - newtonian forces between two test masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 , due to @xmath0 exchange . the total potential between 1 and 2 is @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the total number of protons in the test body @xmath18 . in ( [ v ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we have neglected the new electron - proton and electron - electron force since the corresponding value for @xmath11 in the case of the electron is smaller than ( [ y ] ) by a factor @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> when the two test bodies are constituted each by only one element , with atomic numbers @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and mass numbers @xmath22 and @xmath23 , we can approximate ( [ v ] ) by @xmath24 \\label{vapprox}\\ ] ] where now in the second term inside the square brackets i.e. , the term containing the correction to the newtonian potential , we have approximated @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - newtonian part of the potential we have obtained has two clear properties : it has a finite range @xmath26 and depends on the composition of the bodies , i.e. on their @xmath27 values . </S>",
    "<S> we can use the abundant experimental bounds on fifth - type forces to limit our parameter @xmath7 as a function of @xmath28 .    to see how we proceed </S>",
    "<S> we find now the limit in the interesting ranges @xmath29 mm , with the pvlas results in mind . </S>",
    "<S> bounds on new forces have been obtained by experiments designed to measure very small forces . in the submillimeter range , in 1997 authors of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using a micromechanical resonator designed to measure casimir force between parallel plates gave limits on new forces , and they also estimated the corresponding limits on the mass and inverse coupling constant of scalar particles . also , strong experimental limits on new forces have been published in @xcite , where they use a torsion pendulum and a rotating attractor in the framework of tests of the gravitational inverse - square law . </S>",
    "<S> the most strict bounds have been obtained very recently by using torsion - balance experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the limit from the experiment presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for @xmath30 ev is @xmath31 which leads , introducing the conservative values for @xmath32 of 0.4 , @xmath33    to obtain now a limit on @xmath7 , we will simply put the value of the log in ( [ y ] ) equal to 1 ; this will lead to a conservative limit since @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> with this , we obtain @xmath35    such a high lower bound implies that no signal of a @xmath36 particle of mass @xmath37 mev should be seen in experiments like pvlas @xcite or cast @xcite . in order to reach our conclusion </S>",

    "<S> our final discussion is about modified @xmath1 vertices . </S>",
    "<S> examples of such models have been developed in @xcite with the motivation of making compatible the pvlas particle interpretation with the bounds coming from stellar energy loss and a fortiori with the cast results . in these models </S>",
    "<S> the alp does couple to new paraphotons and has not a direct coupling to photons . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 vertex arises because there is kinetic photon - paraphoton mixing . </S>",
    "<S> also , a paraphoton mass @xmath38 induces an effective photon form factor such that the coupling is reduced for @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> when there is a form factor with a low scale @xmath38 , the analysis shown in this paper should be modified accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case the lagrangian in ( [ lone ] ) is valid only for photons with momentum @xmath40 such that @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the induced yukawa will be suppressed with respect to the value ( [ y ] ) , and thus the lower bound ( [ m_bound ] ) can be very much relaxed if indeed @xmath38 is a low energy scale .    in order to quantify our last assertion , </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the induced yukawa coupling when the photons have a modified propagator @xmath42 now the diagram of fig.1 is finite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the coupling to protons @xmath43 , at leading order in @xmath44 gives @xmath45    to find the potential between bodies we have to take into account the coupling to protons as well as to electrons , because ( [ yp ] ) is independent of the mass of the fermion . </S>",
    "<S> the potential when having a form factor ( [ ff ] ) is given by @xmath46 \\label{vff}\\ ] ] we see that the new non - standard potential ( [ vff ] ) has a yukawa coupling @xmath43 that compared to ( [ y ] ) is suppressed by a factor of order @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath38 introduced in @xcite is not fully specified by the theory . in order to solve the pvlas - cast puzzle and </S>",
    "<S> if we do not wish too different scales in the model , @xmath38 should be in the subev range with a preferred value @xmath47 mev . </S>",
    "<S> for this value , the bound ( [ m_bound ] ) would relax by 12 orders of magnitude , bringing it close to the pvlas value @xmath6 gev . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably enough , experiments searching for new forces and testing casimir forces at the submm lengths may be sensitive to the potential ( [ vff ] ) that corresponds to a vertex with the form factor ( [ ff ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * note added :* the fact that a scalar - photon - photon coupling gives rise to new forces and leads to a bound on @xmath7 has been independently realized by shmuel nussinov @xcite . </S>"
