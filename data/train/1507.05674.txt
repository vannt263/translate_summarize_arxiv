    "so heisnberg said that the bohr orbits are not very important .",

    "physical systems do not give rise to a global regular lattice of quantum states .",

    "the objective behind our program of bohr - sommerfeld - heisenberg quantization of a completely integrable hamiltonian system is    1 .    2 .    3",
    "the mathematical pendulum has a @xmath4 symmetry given by multiplication of the angle and the conjugate momentum by @xmath5 .",
    "its fixed points are the equilibria of the pendulum .",

    "consists of two disjoint tori and the action of @xmath4 interchanges these tori . for energy lower than the energy of the unstable equilibrium ,",
    "the quantum number of a bohr - sommerfeld energy level gives the number of @xmath4-orbits in the graph of the basic vector in @xmath0 corresponding to this energy level .",
    "the energy level of the unstable equilibrium divides the phase space of the pendulum into three domains .",
    "construction of operators that shift between quantum states with supports in the same domain is fairly straightforward . to define shifting operators that cross the energy of the unstable equilibrium we have to consider even and odd quantum numbers separately .",
    "the @xmath6-symmetry of the mathematical pendulum lifts to a covering @xmath6 symmetry of the trivial prequantum line bundle @xmath7 in two different ways : one which leaves each point in each fiber fixed and the other which mulitplies each point in each fiber by @xmath5 . removing a suitable subset of @xmath8 ,",
    "the @xmath6 orbit space is again a line bundle over a smooth manifold @xmath9 , which is the orbit space of the @xmath6-action on the phase space of the mathematical pendulum less two points for the first @xmath6-action ; and @xmath10 , which the orbit space less a line segment joining the singular points of the orbit space of the @xmath6-action on the phase space for the second action . on each of these reduced line bundles",
    "there is a connection .",
    "thus the corresponding @xmath6-reduced hamiltonian systems have bohr - sommerfeld - heisenberg quantizations .",
    "we show that their reconstructions give rise to the even and odd bohr - sommerfeld - heisenberg quantum spectrum , respectively .",

    "these correspond to a stable elliptic and an unstable hyperbolic equilibrium point of @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "l +   +   +      in this subsection we find action - angle coordinates @xmath27 for the mathematical pendulum .",
    "first , we introduce the action function @xmath28 on @xmath29 such that for every energy level @xmath30 ,  the restriction of @xmath28 to @xmath30 is @xmath31 before giving explicit expressions for @xmath28 and @xmath32 we compute the poisson bracket @xmath33 as follows : @xmath34 \\notag \\\\ & = - { \\mbox{${\\scriptstyle \\frac{{1}}{{2\\pi}}}$ } }   \\int_{\\gamma } { \\mathrm{d}}\\vartheta   = -1 , \\notag \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath35 and @xmath30 is parmetrized by a periodic integral curve @xmath36 of @xmath37 of period @xmath38 , which we reparmetrize using @xmath39 .",
    "because the matrix of the symplectic form @xmath40 in action angle coordinates is @xmath41 it follows that @xmath42 .",

    "thus @xmath28 is constant on the integral curves of @xmath37 .",

    "it follows from the above discussion that the action function @xmath28 , defined by equation ( [ 0 ] ) is continuous on @xmath29 .",

    "the horizontal lift @xmath125 of the closed curve @xmath36 is a closed curve in the line bundle @xmath8 if and only it @xmath139 . since @xmath140 is a multivalued function and @xmath141 , it follows that @xmath125 is a closed curve in @xmath8 if and only if we have @xmath142 .    for @xmath75 , @xmath143 , and there are integral curves @xmath144 and @xmath145 of @xmath18 such that where @xmath146 is the image of @xmath144 and @xmath147 are image of @xmath145 . the same argument as in the preceding paragraph shows that the horizontal lift @xmath148 of @xmath144 is a closed curve in @xmath8 if and only if @xmath149 where @xmath150 is an integer .",

    "the action integral is independent of the parametrization of @xmath36 within its orientation class .",
    "however , the change of orientation of @xmath36 would lead to the change from @xmath159 to @xmath160 .",

    ", we shall refer to the image an integral curve @xmath36 of @xmath18 that satisfies equation ( [ bohr - sommerfeld ] ) as a _ bohr - sommerfeld torus_. the integer @xmath159 on the right hand side of equation ( [ bohr - sommerfeld ] ) is called the _ quantum number _ of the corresponding bohr - sommerfeld torus . since integral curves of @xmath18 preserve the hamiltonian @xmath19 , we may rewrite equation ( [ bohr - sommerfeld ] ) in the form @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a connected component of the energy level @xmath30 .",
    "thus , bohr - sommerfeld conditions ( [ bohr - sommerfeld ] ) impose conditions on the energy .",
    "the set of values of the energy allowed by bohr - sommerfeld conditions is interpreted as the _ quantum energy spectrum _ of the system .    from the discussion preceding theorem [ bs ]",
    "it follows that a section @xmath117 of the prequantum line bundle , which is covariantly constant along @xmath105 , has support contained in the union of bohr - sommerfeld tori and the energy levels @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "since @xmath163 is a critical point , the restriction of @xmath117 to @xmath163 is the value of @xmath117 at @xmath163 which is not restricted by the condition that @xmath117 is covariantly constant along @xmath105 .",
    "thus , we may allow the value @xmath111 in equation ( [ bohr - sommerfeld1 ] ) , and consider @xmath163 as a _ singular _ bohr - sommerfeld torus corresponding to the quantum number @xmath165 .",
    "the energy level @xmath164 is the union of two homoclinic orbits @xmath166 of @xmath18 and the unstable equilibrium point @xmath167 if @xmath117 is a section of @xmath8 that is covariantly constant along @xmath105 , then the restrictions of @xmath117 to @xmath145 and @xmath144 are unrestricted because the homoclinic orbits @xmath168 are not closed . as in the case of @xmath169",
    "the value of @xmath117 at @xmath170 is unrestricted .",
    "however , if we require that @xmath117 restricted to @xmath164 is continuous , we would encounter an obstruction in the form of the holonomy group of the restrictions of @xmath97 to the circles @xmath171 . the results of section 2.2 give @xmath172 .",
    "thus , the circles @xmath173 satisfy bohr - sommerfeld conditions ( [ bohr - sommerfeld1 ] ) if @xmath174 that is , @xmath175 is a rational number . in the quasiclassical approximation of the schrdinger equation , planck s constant @xmath100",
    "is treated as a continuous parameter , which excludes the condition that it is of the form @xmath176 .",
    "moreover , condon @xcite has analyzed solutions of the schrdinger equation for the mathematical pendulum and has concluded that the the energy level @xmath81 is not in the quantum energy spectrum .",
    "therefore , throughout this paper , we assume the following .    [ condon]the energy level @xmath81 is not in the quantum energy spectrum .",

    "since the union of bohr - sommerfeld tori has empty interior , such sections can be smooth only in the sense of distributions .",
    "therefore , we adopt the following definition .    a quantum state of the mathematical pendulum is a section @xmath117 of the prequantization line bundle @xmath8 , whose support lies in the union of bohr - sommerfeld tori , such that for each bohr - sommerfeld torus @xmath179 the restriction @xmath180 of @xmath117 to @xmath179 is a smooth covariantly constant section of @xmath181 .",

    "thus , we have obtained a hilbert space structure of the space of states of the mathematical pendulum .",
    "note that this structure is not uniquely determined by the geometry of the classical phase space .",

    "bohr - sommerfeld quantization assigns to a quantizable function @xmath186 a linear operator @xmath187 on @xmath0 such that , for each bohr - sommerfeld torus @xmath188 @xmath189    observe that the operators @xmath187 corresponding to bohr - sommerfeld quantizable functions @xmath186 are diagonal in the bohr - sommerfeld basis . since the bohr - sommerfeld tori are closed and mutually disjoint , for any function @xmath190 on the collection of bohr - sommerfeld tori , there exists a function @xmath191 such that @xmath192 .",
