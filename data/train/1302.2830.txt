    "fuelled by the recent availability of digitized data from many sources , including social , technological , and natural systems , the scientific community has placed renewed interest into quantitative analysis of large datasets . in this context , _ complex networks theory _ has emerged as one of the most active research areas providing new analytical techniques  @xcite .",
    "in essence , complex networks focuses on developing understanding of a system from its representation as a collection of objects called nodes and the relations between them , called edges .",
    "the set of nodes and edges together are known as a graph ( in mathematics ) or network ( in complex networks theory and in physics ) .",
    "some examples of network representations are people and their friendships , particles and their collisions , or statistical variables and their correlations .",
    "the techniques of complex networks are meant to be quite general .",
    "some well studied examples of graphs are social networks  @xcite , power grids  @xcite , and networks of infectious disease propagation  @xcite , although there are many more systems that are being tackled with these techniques .",
    "the general approach of complex networks is to study the statistical properties of a graph @xmath8 or set of graphs @xmath9 such as degree distribution ( where degree is the number of edges connected to a node , equivalent to the number of node neighbors ) , distribution of shortest path lengths among nodes ( which is at the core of the small world notion and of six degrees of separation  @xcite ) , and community structure ( loosely defined as groups of nodes among which there are more edges than with the rest of the graph )  @xcite .",
    "of all these properties , the degree distribution is perhaps the most widely used in ongoing research , due to its relevance in several other quantities such as the percolation threshold of a network  @xcite .    in some systems ,",
    "interactions occur in groups of nodes that may be larger than two .",
    "there are numerous examples of this , such as the social networks in which infectious disease propagate , or the statistical interactions between correlated events in financial systems .",
    "regardless of the context , when such multiway interactions occur it is convenient to use hypergraphs , which generalize graphs by substituting edges with hyperedges , conglomerates of nodes that interact together in groups of size @xmath0 ( so - called hyperedge rank ) @xmath10 ( a simple graph or network is a specialization of a hypergraph with @xmath11 exclusively ) .",
    "hypergraphs carry equivalent notions to those of graphs , such as path length and degree  @xcite .",
    "this approach is gradually gaining attention  @xcite .",
    "the degree of a node changes meaning slightly in hypergraphs . while degree continues to be the number of hyperedges a node is connected to , this is no longer equivalent to the number of node neighbors a given node has . in the context of ensembles of random hypergraphs or graphs , as is our interest here , this change indicates that one must separately measure the node degree distribution and the node neighbor distribution .",
    "this later quantity ( henceforth referred to as neighbor distribution for short ) , has received little direct attention despite its intuitive relevance ( see illustrative discussion on disease propagation at the end of sec .  [ degree - dist - sec ] , where the impact on quarantine numbers is discussed ) . in this article ,",
    "i focus on the neighbor distribution in the case of homogeneous random hypergraphs of uniform rank @xmath0 ( all hyperedges are of size @xmath0 ) , and derive complete results that cover all hypergraph densities .",
    "this is done via hypergraph projections onto graphs as explained next  @xcite .    to determine the neighbor distribution in hypergraph ensembles , it is equivalent to look at projections of hypergraphs onto graphs and calculate the usual degree distribution in the projected graph ensembles  @xcite .",
    "the projections are defined so that if two nodes are connected by any hyperedge then the projected graph has an edge between those nodes .",
    "the notion of projection , useful here as a tool to calculate neighbor distribution , is important in its own right because it is customary to first attempt to use graphs whenever possible , typically weighted graphs , before introducing hypergraphs  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that an equivalence can be established between hypergraphs and bipartite networks  @xcite as explained in chap .",
    "7 of ref .",
    "@xcite , making this work useful in that context as well . for bipartite networks",
    ", the graph projection corresponds to so - called one - mode networks , where once again , the degree distribution is the quantity of interest .",
    "some relevant work has been done for bipartite networks that is related to the topic of this article  @xcite , but it is confined to the sparse limit , and therefore still leaves unanswered questions .",
    "the complication in calculating the neighbor distribution is that it is affected by a kind of degeneracy due to the potential presence of one or more nodes in multiple hyperedges ( node overlaps ) .",
    "this makes the distribution calculation non - trivial . in tracking this degeneracy ,",
    "the need for a new enumerative quantity emerges .",
    "if @xmath3 represents number of neighbors and @xmath2 number of hyperedges , the enumerative quantity is @xmath6 which , as explained below , is the cardinality of the set of all possible ways that @xmath2 hyperedges of rank @xmath0 anchored to a specific node visit exactly @xmath3 distinct other nodes .",
    "@xmath6 also corresponds to the number of distinct labelled hypergraphs with @xmath3 nodes and @xmath2 hyperedges of rank @xmath7 such that all nodes belong to at least one hyperedge .",
    "as far as the author is aware , this is the first study of @xmath6 ; some partial results exist for the case of @xmath12 in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this article",
    ", @xmath6 is calculated by two different methods , and a number of identities relevant to the neighbor distribution are derived for it .",
    "the calculation of @xmath6 allows for an exact solution to the neighbor distribution , as well as the derivation of its sparse and dense asymptotics . in the conclusions ,",
    "i briefly describe how to tackle the full problem where rank @xmath0 is no longer uniform .",
    "a number of excellent recent publications  @xcite touch on a related form of the neighbor distribution problem posed here , by counting neighbors multiple times if they are part of different hyperedges .",
    "however , in those publications , the focus resides in the sparse limit , where overlaps are small ( see results in sec .",
    "[ degree - dist - sec ] ) , and therefore the error made is asymptotically small , decaying in inverse proportion to the system size .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : sec .",
    "[ degree - dist - sec ] focuses on constructing the basics of hypergraph projections onto graphs , and showing the expressions for the neighbor distribution of the projected graphs in general and in the dense and sparse limits .",
    "section  [ qr - sec ] deals with the calculation of @xmath6 by two methods : inclusion - exclusion principle of combinatorics , and graph assembly .",
    "the later method is developed in detail for @xmath13 and additional results are developed to apply it to @xmath6 , i.e. , general @xmath0 . in order to apply @xmath6 to the neighbor distribution , a number of combinatorial identities are derived and presented in sec .  [ identities - sec ] .",
