    "photonic crystal fibers are a new class of optical fibers that have a periodic cladding  @xcite .",
    "light can be confined to the core either by the band gap effect or by total internal reflection by average refractive index difference .",
    "photonic crystal fibers have many intriguing characteristics , for example , they can be endlessly single mode , have extremely small or large mode areas and still remain single mode . also the dispersion properties of photonic crystal fibers",
    "are very different from standard optical fiber .",
    "the research of photonic crystal fiber lasers @xcite and amplifiers @xcite has been intense in the past few years .",
    "the aim has been two - fold .",
    "first , the possibility of obtaining a small mode area has been exploited by designing high - gain amplifiers / lasers where the overlap between the mode distribution and doped area is maximized . on the other hand ,",
    "the possibility of obtaining a large mode area has been utilized for realizing high - power amplifiers / lasers with low nonlinearity .",
    "small - mode area photonic crystal fibers generally have large dispersion and nonlinearity that also depend strongly on the wavelength  @xcite . in this paper , we study the propagation of 200 fs pulses in high - gain small - mode area photonic crystal fiber amplifiers . when short pulses are considered , the spectrum is wide and thus the wavelength dependence of the different parameters has a profound effect on the pulse propagation .",
    "we compare the temporal and spectral widths , time - bandwidth products , and chirps of the pulses and amplification properties for different fiber geometries .",
    "we find out that the wavelength dependence of the parameters has a substantial effect on the pulse properties after it has propagated a short distance in the fiber amplifier .",
    "the dispersion caused by the wavelength dependence of the nonlinearity counteracts the dispersion of the fiber and thus the pulses do not broaden as much as it is expected by considering constant parameter values for dispersion and nonlinearity . on the other hand , the spectral broadening and chirping become asymmetric when the wavelength dependence of the parameters is taken into account .",
    "also , the wavelength dependence of the dispersion parameters and gain is seen to influence the pulse quality less , compared to the important effect of wavelength dependence of nonlinearity , indicating that in some cases they could be approximated by constant values when simulating pulse propagation in photonic crystal fibers .",
    "the pulse propagation is studied with the optical nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath0 which is simulated by the split - step fourier method  @xcite . the parameters for gain , nonlinearity and dispersion are taken to be either constants @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 or wavelength dependent @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the slowly varying envelope of the pulse is taken to be gaussian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the peak power and @xmath9 is the pulse length .",

    "we consider an erbium - doped fiber amplifier .",
    "the gain as a function of wavelength is as in fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite and it is approximated to be the same for all geometries since it has the least effect on the pulse propagation characteristics such as pulse broadening . also , according to ref .",
    "@xcite the gain dependence on the wavelength is strongly influenced by the emission and absorption cross section rather than by the photonic crystal fiber geometry .",
    "we investigate photonic crystal fibers with a triangular lattice of air holes in the cladding .",
    "the core is formed by a missing hole .",
    "we consider geometries with the hole diameter to period ratios @xmath18 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 and periods @xmath19 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 @xmath20 m .",
    "the geometries are those of interest in the research on high - gain efficiency photonic crystal fiber amplifiers  @xcite .",

    "the functional form of the @xmath3 as a function of the wavelength is very different for the different fiber geometries .",
    "for example , for @xmath19 @xmath20 m , the value of @xmath24 in the center of the considered wavelength range is positive when @xmath22=0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 , but negative when @xmath22=0.5 and 0.6 , which can affect the pulse propagation considerably .",
