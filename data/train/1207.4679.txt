    "it is well known that the long - term creep and relaxation tests , typically used for determining viscoelastic and biphasic / poroelastic properties , are not appropriate for rapidly assessing the dynamic biomechanical properties of biological tissues like articular cartilage . for in vivo measurements of tissue viability , @xcite developed a dynamic indentation instrument , which employs a single - frequency ( 20  hz ) sinusoidal oscillatory waveform superimposed on a carrier load .",
    "it is to note that the oscillation test requires some time period to elapse before recording the measurement to minimize the influence of the initial conditions .",
    "that is why the indentation or compression tests with the half - sinusoidal loading history are so tempting . in particular , the half - sinusoidal history is useful for developing indentation - type scanning probe - based nanodevices reported by @xcite . also , as a first approximation , such a indentation history can be used for modeling impact tests @xcite .    in the present paper",
