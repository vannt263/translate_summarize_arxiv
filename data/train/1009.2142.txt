    "one of the most fundamental challenges in digital geometry is to define a `` good '' digital representation of a geometric object .",
    "of course , the meaning of the word `` good '' here heavily depends on particular conditions we may impose .",
    "looking at the problem of digitalization in the plane , the goal is to find a set of points on the integer grid @xmath0 that approximates well a given object .",
    "the topology of the grid @xmath0 is commonly defined by the graph whose vertices are all the points of the grid , and each point is connected by an edge to each of the four points that are either horizontally or vertically adjacent to it .    knowing that a straight line segment is one of the most basic geometric objects and a building block for many other objects , defining its digitalization in a satisfying manner is vital .",
    "hence , it is no wonder that this has been a hot scientific topic in the last few decades , see  @xcite for a recent survey and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for related work , dealing with the problem of representing objects in digital geometry without causing topological and combinatorial inconsistencies .    for any pair of points @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the grid @xmath0",
    "we want to define the digital line segment @xmath3 connecting them , that is , @xmath4 .",
    "chun et al .",
    "in  @xcite put forward the following four axioms that arise naturally from properties of line segments in euclidean geometry .    1 .   _",
    "grid path property : _ for all @xmath5 , @xmath3 is the vertex set of a path from @xmath1 to @xmath2 in the grid graph .",
    "symmetry property : _ for all @xmath5 , we have @xmath6 .",
    "subsegment property : _ for all @xmath5 and every @xmath7 , we have @xmath8 .",
    "prolongation property : _ for all @xmath9 , there exists @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    first , note that ( s3 ) is not satisfied by the usual way a computer visualizes a segment . a natural definition of the digital straight segment between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath17 .",
    "this does not satisfy ( s1 ) , but it could be easily fixed by a slight modification of the definition .",
    "still , it also does not satisfy ( s3 ) , for example , for @xmath18 , the subsegment from @xmath19 to @xmath2 is not contained in the segment from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "even though the set of axioms ( s1)-(s4 ) seems rather natural , there are still some fairly exotic examples of digital segment systems that satisfy all four of them .",
    "for example , let us fix a double spiral @xmath20 centered at an arbitrary point of @xmath0 , traversing all the points of @xmath0 . as it is a spanning path of the grid graph , we can set @xmath3 to be the path between @xmath1 and @xmath2 on @xmath20 , for every @xmath21 .",
    "it is easy to verify that this system satisfies axioms ( s1)-(s4 ) .",
    "another condition was introduced in  @xcite to enforce the monotonicity of the segments , ruling out pathological examples like the one above . here",
    ", we phrase this monotonicity axiom differently , but still , the system of axioms ( s1)-(s5 ) remains equivalent to the one given in  @xcite .    1 .   _",
    "monotonicity property : _ if both @xmath5 lie on a line that is either horizontal or vertical , then the whole segment @xmath3 belongs to this line .",
    "we call a system of digital line segments that satisfies the system of axioms ( s1)-(s5 ) a _ consistent digital line segments system ( cds)_. it is straightforward to verify that every cds also satisfies the following three conditions .",
    "* if the slope of the line going through @xmath1 and @xmath2 is non - negative , then the slope of the line going through any two points of @xmath3 is non - negative . the same holds for non - positive slopes .",
    "* for all @xmath5 , the grid - parallel box spanned by points @xmath1 and @xmath2 contains @xmath3 . *",
    "if the intersection of two digital segments contains two points @xmath22 , then their intersection also contains the whole digital segment @xmath3 .",
    "we give a simple example of a cds , where the segments follow the boundary of the grid - parallel box spanned by the endpoints .",
    "let @xmath23 be two points with coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath24 , we define @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 , we swap the points @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and define the segment as in the previous case .",
    "it can be easily verified that this way we defined a cds , but the digital segments in this system visually still do not resemble well the euclidean segments .",
    "one of the standard ways to measure how close a digital segment is to a euclidean segment is to use the hausdorff distance .",
    "we denote by @xmath27 the euclidean segment between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and by @xmath28 the euclidean length of @xmath27 . for two plane objects @xmath29 and @xmath30 , by @xmath31",
    "we denote their hausdorff distance .",
    "the main question raised in  @xcite was if it is possible to define a cds such that a euclidean segment and its digitalization have a reasonably small hausdorff distance .",
    "more precisely , the goal is to find a cds satisfying the following condition .    1 .",
    "_ small hausdorff distance property : _ for every @xmath5 , we have that @xmath32 .",
    "note that in the cds example we gave , the hausdorff distance between a euclidean segment of length @xmath33 and its digitalization can be as large as @xmath34 .    while this question was not resolved in  @xcite , a clever construction of a system of digital rays _ emanating from the origin of @xmath0 _ that satisfy ( s1)-(s5 ) and ( h ) was presented .",
    "moreover , it was shown using schmidt s theorem  @xcite that already for rays emanating from the origin , the @xmath35-bound imposed in condition ( h ) is the best bound we can hope for , directly implying the following theorem .",
    "@xcite [ t : cknt ] there exists a constant @xmath36 , such that for any cds and any @xmath37 , there exist @xmath5 with @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a novel and general approach for the construction of a cds .",
    "namely , for any total order @xmath40 on @xmath41 , we show how to derive a cds from @xmath40 .",

    "a way to see that such a cds can not be derived from a total order is to observe that now the diagonal translation of a digital line segment does not always yield another digital line segment , that is , these examples do not satisfy the condition from observation  [ obs_diagonal_translation_invariance ] .",

    "we distinguish two possible cases how the slope @xmath298 of a line @xmath296 may look like . if there is a @xmath314 such that @xmath315 or @xmath316 , that is , if its boundary can be described by the smallest element , either including or excluding this element , then we call the slope @xmath298 _ rational_. in the special cases @xmath317 and @xmath318 we define @xmath298 as rational , too .",
    "if no such @xmath218 exists , or , in other words , if @xmath298 does not have a smallest element and its complement @xmath319 does not have a greatest element ( and they are not empty ) , then we call @xmath298 _ irrational_.    we proceed by analyzing the digital lines derived from the special total order that we defined in section  [ s : h ] . with the help of the previous lemma , we can characterize which lines do have unique parallels and which do not .",
    "let @xmath40 be the total order on @xmath41 defined in section  [ s : h ] using the powers of @xmath61 , @xmath320 the cds obtained from it , and @xmath296 a line with respect to @xmath320 .",

    "consequently @xmath323 and @xmath325 either have a common halfline to the left and split at one point to run parallel at distance one thereafter , or the other way round .    note that @xmath40 is a dense order on @xmath41 , that is , for any integers @xmath110 , we find a @xmath314 such that @xmath326 .",
    "equivalently , this means that every @xmath40-interval @xmath327_{\\prec}$ ] with @xmath328 is infinite .",

    "( beside density , this is the only property of @xmath40 that we use . ) according to lemma  [ lemma_slope_difference ] , @xmath127 and @xmath296 do intersect in a finite segment in this case , which is a contradiction because @xmath127 is parallel to @xmath296 .",
    "therefore , @xmath308 consists of one element . if @xmath298 is irrational , by adding one element to @xmath298 or removing one element from @xmath298 we do not get an interval .",
    "hence , in this case , there is only one possible slope for any line parallel to @xmath296 , namely , @xmath298 . if @xmath298 is rational , then either @xmath331 or @xmath332 , for some @xmath333 , so removing @xmath218 or adding @xmath218 , respectively , yields the only different possible slope for a parallel through @xmath1 . as the slopes of these two parallels only differ by one element , they either have a common halfline to the left or a common halfline to the right .",
    "it is natural to ask whether there is a cds in more than two dimensions .",
    "the definition of a cds directly carries over to the higher dimensional spaces . instead of @xmath0",
    "we now consider @xmath334 , for a fixed integer @xmath335 , with the usual graph structure , that is , two points @xmath1 and @xmath2 are adjacent if they differ in exactly one coordinate by exactly one .",
    "the axioms ( s1)-(s4 ) stay the same , verbatim , and the monotonicity axiom ( s5 ) now reads as follows : if for @xmath336 there is an @xmath111 such that @xmath337 , then for all @xmath338 we have @xmath339 . we define the _ slope type _ of a pair of points @xmath340 as the sign vector @xmath341 , @xmath342 if @xmath343 , and @xmath344 if @xmath345 . the slope type of a digital segment @xmath3 is defined as the slope type of @xmath340 .",
    "we say a segment has _ strictly positive slope _ , if its slope type is @xmath346 , that is , the coordinates are monotone increasing in each coordinate .",
    "it is not hard to see that we can again derive a consistent system from an arbitrary total order @xmath40 on @xmath41 if we only consider segments that have strictly positive slope , that is , slope type @xmath346 ; the only difference is that now we have to cut the segment interval @xmath347 $ ] into @xmath348 parts , according to @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath349 be two points , such that @xmath343 for all @xmath350 .",
    "we can define the segment @xmath48 in a similar way as in the two dimensional case  starting at @xmath1 and repeatedly going in one of the @xmath348 possible directions , collecting points from @xmath334 , until reaching @xmath2 .",

[ theorem_order_to_cds_3d ]",
    "the definition above yields a cds of segments with strictly positive slope .",
    "the crucial axiom to verify is the subsegment property ( s3 ) .",
    "assume there are two segments with strictly positive slope , splitting at some point @xmath1 and meeting again for the first time at @xmath2 .",
    "the two subsegments from @xmath1 to @xmath2 can be seen as words over the alphabet @xmath357=\\{1,2,\\ldots , d\\}$ ] , where @xmath50 stands for going in the first direction , @xmath61 for going in the second direction , and so on .",
    "so let @xmath358^k$ ] be these two words . by assumption",
    "they differ at the beginning and at the end and they contain the same number of each of the letters , that is , for any @xmath359 $ ] , @xmath360 . without loss of generality",

    "( if there were no such @xmath111 , then for any @xmath362 with @xmath363 we have @xmath365 .",
    "now looking at all letters that are strictly smaller than @xmath366 in both words , we see that there is at least one such letter more in @xmath116 , namely at the first position , a contradiction . )",
    "this leads to a contradiction , as translated back to the original setting it implies @xmath367 , if we look at the interval of the first segment , and at the same time @xmath368 , if we look at the interval of the second segment .",
    "this proves ( s3 ) .",
    "the rest of the axioms can be verified similarly as in the 2-dimensional case .",
    "of course , we can use the same construction to define segments for all the remaining slope types .",
    "however , unlike in the @xmath61-dimensional case , putting them all together in an attempt to construct a complete cds fails , as the axiom ( s3 ) is violated .",
