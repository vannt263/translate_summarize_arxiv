    "@xmath4 + special functions are invaluable mathematical tools in natural sciences and engineering .",
    "their wide use in analytical performance evaluation studies in wireless communications often allows the derivation of closed - form relationships for vital performance measures such as channel capacity and probability of error .",
    "in addition , the majority of special functions are built - in functions in popular mathematical software packages . as such , the algebraic representation of any related expressions as well as their computation have been significantly simplified .",
    "+ it is recalled that special functions play a significant role in the area of digital communications [ 11]-[13 ] and [ 16]-[19 ] and the references therein .",
    "such a special function is also the two dimensional gaussian q - function .",
    "it is denoted as @xmath0 and is constituted by the two - dimensional gaussian integral , [ 1]-[5 ] .",
    "alternative integral representations for @xmath0 along with performance bounds were reported in [ 6]-[10 ] .",
    "furthermore , an exact infinite series representation , which is expressed in terms of the incomplete gamma function and elementary functions , was derived in [ 11]-[12 ] .",
    "nevertheless , it is noted that this series is the only explicit relationship for the two dimensional gaussian q - function since @xmath0 is neither expressed in terms of other elementary and/or special functions , nor it is included as a built - in function in popular mathematical software packages such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . as a consequence ,",
    "both its computation and analytical tractability are not as straightforward as in the case of most special functions in communication theory .",
    "+ motivated by this , the aim of this work is the derivation of two tight approximations for the @xmath0 function .",
    "the high accuracy of the offered expressions is validated through comparisons with results obtained from numerical integrations as well as by the identity @xmath5 .",
    "an important feature of the proposed approximations is that they are expressed in closed - form and have a rather simple algebraic representation . as a result",
    ", they are expected to be useful in various analytical studies relating to the performance evaluation of digital communications over fading environments .",
    "the two dimensional gaussian q - function is defined as :    @xmath6    according to [ 2 ] , the above relationship can be also represented in the more desired craig form as follows ,    @xmath7    for the special case that @xmath8 , equation @xmath9 reduces to [ 2 ] ,    @xmath10    whereas for the case that @xmath11 , it reduces to the product of the one - dimensional gaussian q - functions of its arguments , namely ,    @xmath12    an exact series representation for @xmath0 was reported in [ 11]-[12 ] , namely ,    @xmath13",
    "it was mentioned above that the only explicit representation of @xmath0 is the infinite series in @xmath14 .",
    "the algebraic form of this series is relatively simple .",
    "however , the fact that it has an infinite form typically raises convergence issues .",
    "more specifically , the number of terms required for truncating the series adequately is sufficiently related to its parameters .",
    "this is evident by the fact that for small values of @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , only a few number of terms are required to truncate the series with small error . on the contrary , as as the value of @xmath16 and @xmath17 increases , the numbers of terms required for a small truncation error also increase . as a consequence ,",
    "the required computation time increase as well .",
    "+ an effective mean to resolve such issues is the derivation accurate approximations that are expressed in closed - form and are also analytically tractable .",
    "such approximated expression can be ultimately derived with the aid of two approximations for the one dimensional q - function , @xmath18 , that were proposed in [ 11]-[13 ] , namely ,    @xmath19    and    @xmath20    the behaviour and high accuracy of @xmath21 and @xmath22 with respect to @xmath18 are illustrated in figure @xmath23 .",
    "this can be also justified by figure @xmath24 which depicts the level of the involved absolute error and absolute relative error , namely ,    @xmath25    and    @xmath26      a closed - form approximation for the @xmath0 function can be derived as follows : the double integral in @xmath27 can be alternatively expressed as , [ 11 ] ,    @xmath28dv\\ ] ]    consequently , by integrating once by part the inner integral and carrying out some straightforward algebraic manipulations , the following equivalent representation is deduced ,    @xmath29    thus , it is evident that an explicit expression for @xmath30 is subject to analytic evaluation of the semi - infinite integral ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 . to this effect , by substituting @xmath21 into @xmath33 , one obtains    @xmath34    which after algebraic manipulations yields the following closed - form expression ,    @xmath35    where ,    @xmath36    and    @xmath37    it is recalled here that the @xmath0 function is not a built - in function in mathematical software packages such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , the following identity holds by definition , @xmath38 . as a consequence ,",
    "the accuracy of equation @xmath39 is assessed by means of the this identity in figures @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "one can clearly observe the excellent agreement between the plotted curves for almost all cases .",
    "this is also evident by the level of the involved absolute and absolute relative which for all cases is less than @xmath42 .      by following the same methodology , a second closed - form approximation for the two dimensional q - function can be derived . to this end , by making the necessary transformation of variables in @xmath22 and then substituting in @xmath33 , the following relationship is deduced ,    @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 evidently , the derivation of a closed - form expression for @xmath46 is subject to analytic evaluation of the three involved integrals .",
    "notably , these integrals have the same algebraic form as the @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , after some straightforward algebraic manipulation , one obtains the following closed - form expression ,    the behaviour of @xmath48 is illustrated in figures @xmath49 and @xmath50 along with the @xmath18 function .",
    "one can observe the excellent agreements between the theoretical and approximated results .",
    "this agreement is also evident by the level of the involved absolute error and absolute relative error which is less than @xmath51 for almost all parametric values .",
    "@xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 where ,    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    and    @xmath60",
    "in this work , we derived two novel closed - form approximations for the two dimensional gaussian q - function , @xmath0",
    ". two critical features of these expressions are their high accuracy and their relatively simple algebraic form .",
    "these features ultimately render them rather convenient to handle both analytically and numerically .",
    "the latter is particularly important since the two dimensional gaussian q - function is not a built - in function in popular mathematical software packages . as a consequence , the derived expression can be considered a useful mathematical tool in various analytical studies in natural sciences and engineering , in general , and particularly in applications in communication theory relating to digital communications over fading channels .",
