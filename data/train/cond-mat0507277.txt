    "dimer models have a venerable history in statistical physics .",
    "@xcite more recently , they have also emerged as central models in modern theories of strongly correlated quantum systems , e.g. , high - temperature superconductors and frustrated antiferromagnets.@xcite there , dimers can represent singlet - forming electron pairs . in order to model the quantum fluctuations of the dimers and realize a short - range version of anderson s resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state , @xcite kivelson , rokhsar , and sethna introduced a hamiltonian with a resonance term which flips pairs of parallel dimers on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice.@xcite the purely classical dimer model also retains it relevance here",
    "; it was shown that the equal - weight sum over all dimer configurations is a ground state of the hamiltonian when the resonance strength equals the potential energy cost of each resonating pair of dimers ( the rk point).@xcite the equal - time dimer correlations of the quantum dimer model are thus those of the classical dimers , @xcite and the imaginary time dynamics can be related to a classical random walk in configuration space.@xcite    the dimer pair correlations of the classical square lattice model decay with distance as @xmath1 and two inserted test monomers are correlated with each other as @xmath2@xcite as it turned out , away from the rk point the dimers form long - range order and the monomers are exponentially confined .",
    "@xcite hence this system does not give rise to the desired rvb state with no broken lattice symmetries and deconfined monomers ( corresponding to spin - charge separation @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , it was shown that a true extended rvb phase _ does _ appear in the quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice.@xcite following this insight , further work has been carried out in order to characterize classical and quantum dimer models on various lattices . moreover , there are currently intense activities in gauge theories related to quantum dimer models .",
    "@xcite    to date , research on dimer models in two dimensions has focused mainly on planar lattices , i.e. , ones that have no intersecting links .",
    "this class of models can be analytically solved , using fermionic path integrals , with the aid of a theorem by kastelyn.@xcite thus the quantum ground states at the corresponding rk points are characterized as well . this body of analytical work has established a number of properties of classical dimer models which are believed to hold true even for non - planar lattices .",
    "the basis for this belief is provided by effective theories incorporating those exact results .",
    "such effective theories are expected to be more robust than the exact solubility , and therefore not crucially dependent on lattice planarity .",
    "consequently , there have been relatively few numerical studies testing these beliefs,@xcite although it is not necessarily the case that the range of behaviours unearthed so far in fact exhausts all possibilities . in this paper",
    ", we provide a detailed study addressing some of these issues .",
    "we do this by considering two extensions of the square lattice dimer model which preserve its full symmetry .",
    "the first case we consider here is a nonbipartite model with nearest - neighbour ( @xmath3 ) and next - nearest - neighbour ( @xmath4 ) dimers .",
    "such bonds will inevitably appear in realistic systems away from the limiting cases represented by the nearest - neighbor ( @xmath3 ) dimer models .",
    "introducing next - nearest - neighbor links along only one of the diagonals destroys the square lattice symmetry and instead yields the topology of the triangular one .",
    "it has already been shown that an arbitrarily small fraction of such diagonal dimers destroys the critical @xmath3 square - lattice state and leads to deconfinement,@xcite as in the isotropic triangular lattice.@xcite the model with links along both diagonal directions , i.e. , the full 2d square lattice with @xmath3 and @xmath4 bonds , is not solvable by kastelyn s theorem.@xcite one would suspect ( see e.g. ref .  )",
    "that the critical state is immediately destroyed in this case as well but this has not been explicitly demonstrated .",
    "similarly , one might speculate that introducing longer bonds between the two sublattices does not lead to deconfinement , but there are no exact results to back this up .",
    "for this reason , we also study the bipartite lattice with @xmath3 and fourth - nearest - neighbors ( @xmath5 , of which there are eight per site ) .    in both the above cases cases , we use an efficient directed - loop @xcite monte carlo algorithm to sample the full space of hard - core dimer configurations , with fugacities @xmath6 assigned to the different dimer types @xmath7 .",
    "we then discuss our results in the framework of effective and simple microscopic analytic treatments .",
    "we confirm that a low ( most likely infinitesimal)@xcite concentration of @xmath4 dimers leads to deconfinement ; in particular , we find that the finite correlation lengths for monomers and dimers induced by the presence of the @xmath4 dimers scales inversely to their fugacity ; @xmath8 .",
    "by contrast the presence of @xmath5 dimers preserves the algebraic decay of dimer correlations , @xmath9@xmath0 .",
    "these correlations have a complex dipolar structure in reciprocal space , which implies that they do not lead to a logarithmic divergence of the structure factor for @xmath10 ; such a divergence is present for the pure @xmath3 model .",
    "for these observations , we provide an approximate analytical theory based on the height model in the coloumb gas representation and a self - consistent mean field solution of a large-@xmath11 generalization of the dimer model .",
    "our numerical simulations show that the confinement exponent governing the monomer correlation function drifts , changing continuously from @xmath12 in the pure @xmath3 case to @xmath13 ( to high numerical accuracy ) for the pure @xmath5 model . in the language of height models",
    ", this corresponds to a decrease of the stiffness induced by the addition of longer - ranged dimers . note that for the pure @xmath5 model , like for the soluble dimer and six - vertex models , the stiffness appears to be a simple rational number .",
    "the efficient directed loop algorithm provides an efficient direct determination of this quantity in general .",

    "ii we introduce the directed - loop algorithm for a wide class of dimer models , and in in sec .",

    "this algorithm is an adaptation of a quantum monte carlo method,@xcite with the same name , in which updates of the system degrees of freedom are carried out along a self - intersecting path at the endpoints of which there are defects not allowed in the configuration space contributing to the partition function .",
    "when the two defects meet they annihilate , the loop closes , and a new allowed configuration is created . the conditions for detailed balance in the process of stochastically moving one of the defects are expressed as a coupled set of _ directed - loop equations_,@xcite the applicability of this scheme to dimer models was first realized by adams and chandrasekharan .",
    "@xcite here an algorithm for the multi - length dimer problem will be presented ; a simplifying representation of the dimer configurations will also be introduced .",

    "crucially , bipartitness allows us to orient each dimer so as to point from one sublattice to the other .",

    "( in @xmath105 , curl and grad are basically interchangeable ) .",

    "implicit in the derivation of such an energy functional of entropic origin is a coarse - graining procedure , which maps many microstates of the dimer model onto fewer macrostates.@xcite in the process , other terms are generated both for the energy and in the identification of operators linking the height variable to , say , dimers and monomers .",
    "these terms are classified by an ` electromagnetic ' charge , which , together with @xmath107 , determines the exponent of the leading power of its correlations.@xcite    first , let us discuss the @xmath3-@xmath4 model .",
    "@xmath4 dimers violate bipartiteness and thus show up as defects in the height surface ; a finite density of such defects destroys the algebraic correlations .",
    "this was calculated analytically for a planar dimer model interpolating between the square and the triangular lattices by switching on only one of the two diagonal directions of next - nearest neighbour bonds . there , a dimer correlation length proportional to the inverse of the small fugacity was also found , which result was supplemented by an effective field theory arguing the same should hold true for monomer correlations in this system.@xcite our numerical results , in particular the scaling plots , confirm that these results hold also for the case of the nonplanar @xmath3-@xmath4 model .    next , we consider the @xmath3-@xmath5 model .",
    "we first note that the monomer correlations have a power - law decay with an exponent given by @xmath107 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath107 from @xmath92 upon adding @xmath5 dimers , implies that the corresponding height model grows floppier ( the heights fluctuate more strongly ) .",
    "we note in passing that it it is rather straightforward to extract the monomer correlations using the directed - loop algorithm , as this only requires keeping track of the monomer separations in intermediate states sampled .",
    "this thus provides a means of determining the stiffness constant @xmath107 with relatively little effort .",
    "the analytical calculation of the dimer correlations are a little more involved than the monomers , as they contain two terms .",
    "one of them , the ` vertex term ' , decays with an exponent of @xmath108 .",
    "the other , the ` dipolar term ' , always decays as @xmath0 ; which of these dominates depends on @xmath107 , and for the pure @xmath3 model , they happen both to decay with the same power law .",
    "it is the vertex term which generates the logarithmic peak in the @xmath46 dimer structure factor in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . upon inclusion of @xmath5 dimers ,",
    "i.e. with increasing @xmath107 , the power of the decay becomes more rapid , and the divergence of this peak thus disappears when @xmath5 dimers are added .",
    "the survival of the leading @xmath0 power in the dimer correlations is solely due to the dipolar term , which arises via the original identification of the dimers and @xmath109 through the lattice flux @xmath110 : if we choose the vectors @xmath111 @xmath112 to point along the direction of a dimer from one sublattice to the other , we find a contribution to the dimer density @xmath113 which is proportional to @xmath114 .",
    "as long as the height correlations grow logarithmically with distance , @xmath115 , as they do for the parameters our simulations probe , the resulting contribution to the dimer correlations always decay as @xmath0 , on account of the derivative linking @xmath103 and @xmath98 . as the power @xmath108 of the vertex term is only slightly larger than 2 for small values of @xmath69 , this leads to the very slow approach to the asymptotic @xmath0 behaviour , as evidenced in our simulations .    despite their @xmath0 behaviour",
    ", the dipolar correlations do not yield a logarithimic peak in the structure factor .",
    "this is because their dipolar structure makes the leading term vanish as the angular part of the fourier integral @xmath116 is performed .",
    "instead , what one finds are the characteristic bow - tie structures@xcite displayed in fig .",
    "these bow - ties are points of non - analyticity ; there is no divergence , but a discontinuity there .",
    "the bow - ties reflect the transverse correlations of a divergence - free field @xmath98 .",
    "these bow - ties are thus oriented with one axis along the dimer under consideration .",
    "it has recently been observed@xcite that a semi - quantitative theory for such correlations can be obtained in the framework of a large-@xmath11 generalisation of the hardcore dimer model , via an intermediate mapping to an ising model , the ground - states of which are in correspondance with the dimer states .",
    "this ising model is then solved in a self - consistent mean - field theory in the limit of low temperatures .",
    "we note that such a generalisation does not preserve the charge - assignments for the operators generated upon coarse - graining , and does therefore miss the vertex term and hence the logarithmic peak for the @xmath3 model .",
    "however , it does provide the angular dependence of the dipolar part of the correlations .    here , we present the relevant theory for the dimer correlations both in the pure @xmath3 and the pure @xmath5 models .",
    "the former is of course also soluble in closed form . in either case ,",
    "one assigns an ising spin @xmath117 to each _ bond _ of the lattice which encodes the presence ( @xmath118 ) or absence ( @xmath119 ) of a dimer on this bond.@xcite the hardcore corresponds to a non - zero magnetisation in the model , but this leaves the shape of its @xmath120 correlations unchanged.@xcite    in the case of the @xmath3 model , there are two bonds per unit cell ( the links of the square lattice in the @xmath121 and @xmath122 directions ) , denoted by vectors @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",

    "these low - temperature spin ( and hence approximate dimer ) correlations are plotted in fig .",

    "we note that not only are the bow - ties of the simulation data , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , reproduced in their correct orientation , but the qualitative structure of @xmath133 in reciprocal space is reproduced throughout .",
    "the results obtained here demonstrate that the 2d square - lattice dimer model becomes deconfined when any finite density of non - bipartite ( next - nearest - neighbor ) dimers are introduced .",
    "the system remains algebraically confined in the presence of longer bipartite ( fourth - nearest - neighbor ) dimers , but the corresponding monomer exponent drifts . in contrast , as the stiffness of the corresponding height surface decreases , the leading dimer - dimer correlation exponent remains unchanged at @xmath0 , due to the persistance of the dipolar term due to the gauge structure captured by the height model .",
    "our results thus fit in with the known beliefs on dimer models and can be seen as a detailed check of their validity .",
    "we have shown that the directed - loop simulation algorithm can produce very accurate results for the drifting monomer exponent .",
    "in particular , the accuracy is high enough to suggest the conjecture that this exponent for the pure @xmath5 model takes the rational value of @xmath134 .",
    "our findings are relevant to quantum dimer models as well .",
    "various resonance terms can be introduced , and corresponding rk points can then be demonstrated in the same way as has been done for other models .",
    "@xcite hence , it is clear that an rvb state can in principle be realized on the square lattice once next - nearest - neighbor dimers are allowed . in the context of the dimer models for the mott instulators relevant to the high-@xmath135 cuprates ,",
    "two points however need to be borne in mind .",
    "firstly , the rokhsar - kivelson quantum dimer models allows a simple classical calculation at the rk point only if it is possible to choose the sign of the off - diagonal matrix elements to be negative , which property needs to be established on a case - by - case basis for non - bipartite models ( it does hold for the bipartite case).@xcite in addition , the description of the singlet space using a dimer basis becomes overcomplete as the coordination of the dimer lattice increases . at any rate ,",

    "<S> we study classical hard - core dimer models on the square lattice with links extending beyond nearest - neighbors . numerically , using a directed - loop monte carlo algorithm , we find that , in the presence of longer dimers preserving the bipartite graph structure , algebraic correlations persist . while the confinement exponent for monomers drifts , the leading decay of dimer correlations remains @xmath0 , although the logarithmic peaks present in the dimer structure factor of the nearest - neighbour model vanish . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , an arbitrarily small fraction of next - nearest - neighbor dimers leads to the onset of exponential dimer correlations and deconfinement . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these results in the framework of effective theories , and provide an approximate but accurate analytical expression for the dimer correlations . </S>"
