    "a decade ago , surveys undertaken at submillimetre ( submm ; 850-@xmath0 m ) wavelengths with scuba ( holland et al .  1999 ) transformed the accepted understanding of galaxy formation and evolution by revealing an unexpected yet significant population of dusty , far - infrared - luminous starburst galaxies ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .  1998 ; barger et al .  1998 ) .",
    "since then , great strides have been made in understanding the nature of submm - selected galaxies  see blain et al .",
    "2002 for a review  largely facilitated by accurately pinpointing smgs in deep , high - resolution radio maps ( e.g.  ivison et al .  1998a , 2000 , 2002 ; smail et al .",
    "2000 ) which helps overcome the coarse resolution of scuba ( fwhm @xmath13 15arcsec ) .",
    "the majority ( 6080 per cent ) of bright ( @xmath14mjy ) smgs have been identified in this way and one of the most important steps forward was the acquisition of about 100 optical / near - infrared spectra of such radio - identified smgs .",
    "this placed them typically in the redshift range @xmath15 , with a median of 2.3 ( chapman et al.2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "however , while submm surveys are equally sensitive to sources of a fixed luminosity in the redshift range @xmath16 , due to the negative @xmath17-correction offsetting the cosmic dimming ( blain & longair 1993 ) , the detection rate of smgs in even the deepest radio surveys drops off rapidly beyond @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the spectroscopic requirement for a robust radio detection biases the known population to @xmath19 .",
    "this led to the suggestion that the 2040 per cent of the bright , radio - blank smgs ( 1.4ghz flux density , @xmath20@xmath0jy ) could be the high - redshift tail of the population ( @xmath21  see carilli & yun 1999 ; ivison et al .",
    "2002 ; eales et al.2003 ; aretxaga et al .  2003 , 2007 ) ,",
    "although using photometric redshifts pope et al .  ( 2006 ) argued that @xmath2214 per cent of the bright smg population is at @xmath12 .",
    "perhaps the strongest candidates for @xmath12 smgs have come from submm / mm interferometry , with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) and the submillimeter array ( sma ) , of a few very bright smgs which  by virtue of their radio , submm / mm and near - infrared properties  were deemed to reside at very high redshift ( dannerbauer et al .",
    "2002 ; wang et al .  2007 ; younger et al .",
    "2007 ) .    soon after the first observations with scuba , surveys were being conducted at 1200@xmath0 m with mambo ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2000 ) resulting in samples of sources that were thought to be identical to smgs , except selected at mm wavelengths .",
    "compared to submm surveys , however , observations at mm wavelengths should be sensitive to far - ir - luminous galaxies out to higher redshifts , due to the @xmath17-correction , as well as to systems with cooler dust temperatures .",
    "as a result , at @xmath23 the 850-/1200-@xmath0 m flux ratio becomes a relatively strong function of redshift for a typical starburst far - infrared / mm spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and may therefore ( if the sed is known ) be used as a crude redshift estimator or  if the redshift is known  as an indicator of the shape ( i.e.  temperature and spectral index ) of the far - infrared / mm sed .",
    "this fact was exploited by eales et al .",
    "( 2003 ; hereafter e03 ) , who obtained 850-@xmath0 m photometric measurements of a sample of 1200-@xmath0m - selected sources and found a significant fraction to have very low 850/1200-@xmath0 m flux ratios ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "they argued that this was either indicative of smgs at @xmath25 or  since a large fraction of their sample was radio - identified with radio - to - submm flux ratios consistent with @xmath26  smgs having fundamentally different dust emission properties than local galaxies .",
    "the existence of a significant number of these sdos , which we define here as sources with @xmath27 , was questioned ( albeit not ruled out ) by greve et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter g04 ) , who performed the first unbiased comparison of 850- and 1200-@xmath0m - selected sources , using catalogues extracted from scuba and mambo maps .",
    "the degree of overlap between source populations extracted from submm and mm surveys ( and in particular the idea that mm observations are tracing a significant sub - population of more distant and/or cooler sources ) remains controversial , therefore , and is further complicated by the difficulty of comparing ( sub)mm surveys with different depths and noise properties .",
    "nonetheless , settling this issue is important ; regardless of the outcome , it tells us about the population of dusty galaxies at the highest redshifts , with significant implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .    in this paper",
    "we present an unbiased 1200-@xmath0 m mambo survey of the northern field of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods - n  giavalisco et al .",
    "as well as presenting the 1200-@xmath0 m map and source catalogue , we also perform a rigorous comparison between our data and the existing 850-@xmath0 m scuba map of this region ( borys et al .  2003 ;",
    "pope et al .  2005 ) , in order to address the issues outlined above . in a follow - up paper , we shall exploit other high - quality data in the goods",
    "- n field to explore the multi - wavelength properties of 1200-@xmath0 m selected sources .    throughout this paper",
    "we have adopted a flat cosmology with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ( spergel et al.2003 ) .",
    "a 1200-@xmath0 m ( 250-ghz ) map covering the entire goods - n region was obtained using the 117-channel bolometer array , mambo ( kreysa et al.1998 ) , on the iram 30-m telescope on pico veleta in spain .",
    "the data were obtained during the winter semester 2005 - 06 in good weather conditions , meaning 250-ghz opacities of @xmath310.3 and stable atmospheric conditions ( low sky - noise ) .    in order to map the entire field as uniformly as possible , a number of regular grid positions ( 2 arcmin apart ) were observed .",
    "specifically , each such grid position was observed twice , using a standard on - the - fly 300arcsec @xmath32 320arcsec az  alt scan - map . with a scanning speed of 5arcsecs@xmath3 in az and an elevation spacing between each sub - scan of 8arcsec , a scan - map takes @xmath243min to complete , allowing for a 3-s turnaround after each sub - scan . to avoid any systematics and to minimise the effects of sky rotation",
    ", we tried to observe each grid position once when the field was rising and once when it was setting .",
    "different wobbler throws ( 3645arcsec ) and scan directions ( increasing or decreasing elevation ) were also employed for different scan - maps . in total , 53 scan - maps were obtained .",
    "after each scan - map , a pointing observation on a nearby , bright point source was carried out and , in order to be extra cautious , a focus correction was usually applied after each scan ( sometimes after two scans if the focus appeared stable ) .",
    "since the weather conditions were generally stable , it was sufficient to perform a skydip every 2hr in order to monitor the 250-ghz atmospheric opacity .",
    "skydips were carried out at the same azimuth as the preceeding grid - point observation , ensuring that the opacity was measured for the same part of the sky as the science observations .",
    "the data were reduced with the mopsic software  an improved version of the original mopsi package ( zylka 1998 )  using standard pipeline scripts designed to deal with mambo data .",
    "this involved many of the standard steps in reducing bolometer data , i.e.de-spiking , flat - fielding , removal of correlated noise across the array ( see g04 for details ) , and correction for atmospheric opacity by interpolating between the skydip measurements .",
    "the timestream data were rebinned onto a 1arcsec @xmath32 1arcsec grid using a shift - and - add technique , which results in each positive source being bracketed by two negative counter - images , each with half of the peak positive intensity , located one wobbler throw away , i.e.  the standard ` double - difference ' or ` triple - beam ' pattern",
    ". however , the different wobbler throws and scanning directions employed for different scans ensure that the negative images are averaged out , resulting in a very clean image ( although with some residual effects , discussed in   [ subsection : source - extraction ] ) .",
    "the final 1200-@xmath0 m signal - to - noise ( hereafter s / n ) map and corresponding noise map are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : mambo - maps ] .",
    "the area covered is 287arcmin@xmath1 .",
    "the map exhibits a fairly uniform r.m.s .",
    "noise of @xmath20.7mjybeam@xmath3 over most of its area ( apart from at the edges where the noise is larger , @xmath330.8mjybeam@xmath3 ) .",
    "in order to extract sources , a point spread function ( psf ) was fitted to each pixel in the map and a s / n ratio was ascribed , based on the local noise .",
    "this is similar to the noise - weighted convolution technique applied to mambo maps by g04 and to scuba maps by borys et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and coppin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . unlike scuba , where one can configure the nod / chop such that it remains constant on the sky , mambo experiences sky rotation ; as a result , the psf varies across the map .",
    "we have gone to great lengths to average out the negative chop patterns ( see   [ section : observations - and - data - reduction ] ) , but we still expect to see some effects of the chop throw in the map . to quantify this , we created fake , noiseless time streams of data , containing a number of point sources at certain positions in the map , and then subjected these data to exactly the same data - reduction pipeline as the real data , using the astrometrical information ( coordinates , chop throws etc . )",
    "of the real data to create a map which shows how the psf varies across the map ( fig .",
    "[ figure : psf - map]a ) .    ideally , one would want to use the psf ( including its negative parts ) as the filtering kernel in the source - extraction procedure , as has been done with scuba maps ( e.g.  scott et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter s02 ; borys et al .  2003 ; coppin et al .",
    "2006 ) . in our case , that would entail computing a separate psf for every pixel in the map , or at least some sub - region of the map where the psf is approximately constant . however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure : psf - map]a , the negative features of the net psf are fairly low contrast , spread out over a large area , making it difficult ( and also largely unnecessary ) to use them explicitly in the source - extraction procedure .",
    "this also suggests that the optimal method of combining the data , using an explicit psf for each individual time sample ( see borys et al .",
    "2003 ) , would produce only marginally better results , at the expense of enormously increased complexity .",
    "indeed , we used a few sources to show that the improvement was modest .",
    "we therefore decided to use a simple gaussian ( fwhm , 11.1arcsec ) as an approximation to the psf .",
    "although the 30-m telescope s beam is formally 10.7arcsec fwhm at 1200@xmath0 m , we have adopted a slighter broader psf in order to account for the typical pointing error ( @xmath23arcsec r.m.s . ) . that this is , in fact , a good approximation is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figure : psf - map]b where we have plotted the mean azimuthally averaged psf profiles , along with a gaussian profile with fwhm = 11.1arcsec .",
    "while half of the signal is contained in the negative residuals , it is seen that the depth of the negative holes reach only about 5 per cent of the primary psf height .",
    "this procedure yielded 20 sources with s / n @xmath4 4 and a further 27 sources with @xmath34 ( see table  [ table : mambo - source - list ] ) .        in order to assess the degree to which the extracted source catalogue is contaminated by spurious noise peaks , we randomised the bolometer positions on the array in order to create a scrambled map with no sources , with noise properties similar to that of the real map . in total ,",
    "500 such scrambled maps were produced , each processed by the data - reduction pipeline in exactly the same way as the real data .",
    "[ figure : spurious - detections ] shows the average number of spurious detections in the scrambled maps , when subjected to our source - extraction technique .",
    "the simulations suggest that for @xmath44-@xmath5 sources extracted from the 287arcmin@xmath1 surveyed , less than two are expected to be spurious , while we can expect about seven spurious sources in the 3.5-@xmath5 catalogue .",
    "this is in agreement with similar simulations by g04 .",
    "[ figure : spurious - detections ] also shows how the expected number of spurious sources is larger than for purely uniform gaussian noise , confirming that it is important to carry out the simulations with realistic noise .",
    "a further check on the source robustness can be made by extracting sources from an inverted map , in other words , carrying out the same extraction procedure for _ negative _ sources , which of course can only be real when created by freak alignments of sources and chop throws . in total",
    ", we find 33 sources above 3.5@xmath5 in the inverted map .",
    "all but six are associated with the negative beams of bright positive sources , consistent with expectations .",
    "catalogue completeness varies as a function of the source flux , becoming smaller at lower flux values .",
    "in addition , random noise fluctuations result in the extracted positions being offset from the true source positions ; again , the effect becomes increasingly severe at lower fluxes .",
    "the effect of the noise on the completeness of the survey and on the positional offsets was assessed using monte carlo simulations .",
    "artificial sources with fluxes in the range 112mjy ( in steps of 0.25mjy ) were added to the science map , one at a time , at random positions , and subsequently extracted using exactly the same technique used in ",
    "[ subsection : source - extraction ] .",
    "this procedure was repeated 50 times for every flux bin , each time at a random position in the map .",
    "each injected source was a scaled version of the local psf and as a result the shape and depth of the negative lobes around the sources was a function of the map position .",
    "we also excluded artificial sources which were within half a beam width of any real source , hence this definition of completeness is intended only to assess the effects of noise , without including the effects of confusion ( blain , ivison & smail 1998 ) .    .",
    "* bottom : * the positional offsets between the actual positions of the input sources and their extracted position .",
    "a fit to the function @xmath35 is shown by the solid curve . ]",
    "the resulting completeness curve and positional offsets are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : monte_carlo ] .",
    "the simulations suggest that the survey is close to complete down to a flux density of about 3mjy , and drops precipitously below 2.5mjy .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : monte_carlo ] shows that the positions of sources with flux densities larger than 2.5mjy are determined to within 3arcsec . of course , in addition to the positional offsets shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : monte_carlo ] , the data will contain offsets due to pointing errors . the completeness fractions and positional offsets we obtain here",
    "are very similar to those found by g04 .          for any flux - limited survey in the low - s /",
    "n regime ( as is the case for all submm / mm surveys undertaken to date ) , we must worry about the superposition of sources with positive noise peaks in the map : ` flux boosting ' ( s02 ) .",
    "this effect is particular significant in the submm / mm waveband where the source number counts have a steep negative slope , so that the noise excursions above a threshold do not balance excursions below the threshold .",
    "we chose to follow the bayesian flux deboosting approach developed by coppin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to deal with scuba data .",
    "the philosophy of this method is to assume _ a priori _ knowledge of the pixel brightness distribution , @xmath36 , in the _ noiseless _ map . if the noise in the map is gaussian , the probability of measuring a flux density @xmath37 at some pixel in the map when its true flux is @xmath38 , is @xmath39 we can then use bayes theorem to derive the probability that the true flux of the pixel is @xmath38 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is simply the normalisation constant .",
    "the _ a priori _ flux density distribution , @xmath36 , was generated by making noiseless maps onto which sources selected from a model of the number counts were randomly distributed , and then sampled with the adopted chop pattern . in our case , the chop pattern varies across the map so the overall @xmath36 distribution was derived from noiseless maps created with exactly the same scanning strategy as the real map . for the number counts , we adopted a schechter function of the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43mjy and @xmath44 ; this provides a good fit to the 1200-@xmath0 m number counts by g04 .",
    "the @xmath36 distribution derived from 1,000 such maps is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : deboost ] .",
    "we checked that the use of moderately different number count models has little effect on our results ; one has to considerably alter the faint - end slope in order to make significant changes .",
    "examples of deboosting are given in fig .",
    "[ figure : deboost ] , which shows the probability distribution of the measured flux @xmath45 ( assuming it is gaussian ) and the corresponding deboosted flux distribution @xmath46 for the two sources , gn1200.3 and gn1200.35 .",
    "following coppin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , only sources with a posterior probability less than 5 per cent of having a flux density less than or equal to zero were retained in the final source catalogue .",
    "this means that of the two examples just employed , gn1200.3 makes it into the final catalogue , whereas gn1200.35 does not . adopting",
    "this criterion leads to a total of 17 sources being discarded , all of them originally detected at below 4@xmath5 .",
    "the final revised source list is indicated through column seven of table  [ table : mambo - source - list ] .",
    "we adopt the deboosted flux density as the value at which the @xmath46 distribution peaks , with the errors calculated as the 68 per cent confidence bounds on the non - gaussian deboosted flux distribution . on average",
    ", the deboosting reduces the observed fluxes by about 0.7mjy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : sin - sout ] .",
    "in addition , the deboosting results in larger photometric errors and non - gaussian probability distributions ( see fig .  [ figure : deboost ] ) , particularly in cases where the photometric errors are already large .",
    "the final catalogue of deboosted @xmath43.5-@xmath5 mambo sources consists of 30 sources . in  [ subsubsection : spurious - sources ] we found that seven of the 47 @xmath43.5-@xmath5 sources recovered prior to deboosting were spurious .",
    "hence , of the sources in the deboosted list we expect @xmath27 @xmath32 ( 30/47 ) , or around four , to be spurious .",
    "this is almost certainly an upper limit since deboosting is designed to preferentially remove spurious sources . in table",
    "[ table : mambo - source - list ] we list all of the original @xmath43.5-@xmath5 sources , because many of those which did not pass our deboosting criteria still have a reasonably high chance of being genuine and hence may be useful for follow - up studies at other wavelengths .",

    "2008 ) was used to survey the goods - n region at 1100-@xmath0 m ( perera et al .",
    ". a comparison of the mambo and aztec millimetre maps will be explored in a future paper ( pope et al .  in preparation ) .    in this section",
    "we will compare the 850-@xmath0 m super - map with our new 1200-@xmath0 m image , with two goals : first , to extract a robust sample of smgs detected jointly at 850 and 1200@xmath0 m ; second , to compare the degree of overlap between the populations selected at each wavelength .",
    "the optimal method for extracting sources _ of arbitrary spectral shape _ is to extract sources from the combined s / n map , thereby using all the information from the 1200- and 850-@xmath0 m data .",
    "however , some care must be exercised , for at least two reasons .",
    "first , one is digging into the confusion noise in both images and hence non - gaussianity or systematic artefacts in the maps may start to have effects that were not previously evident .",
    "second , if one had strong prior information about the expected @xmath6 ratio for the emitters then one would adopt a different weighting scheme .",

    "2003 ) is optimal , with the caveats given in   [ subsection : source - extraction ] for finding point sources , under the assumption that the noise distributions in both maps are gaussian and uncorrelated .",
    "the scuba super - map can be thought of as the answer to the question : ` what is the best estimate of the flux density of a point source centred on each pixel ? ' .",
    "the super - map combines data taken in different observing modes , with different chop - throws , etc . , and also takes into account the beam convolution in the process of fitting to the psf .",
    "it follows that an efficient way of extracting point sources , using the information in both maps , is simply to treat the mambo image as additional data .",
    "these can then be combined with the scuba data to provide an overall s / n ` map ' , which gives the combined s / n level for a point source centred on each pixel .",
    "the relevant expression for each pixel is : @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the mambo and scuba noise maps , respectively .",
    "the corresponding noise map is @xmath119 for this method to work straightforwardly , the two maps need to be astrometrically aligned and to have the same pixel scale and resolution . to this end",
    ", both maps were binned onto a 1-arcsec@xmath1 pixel grid and we checked that no shift between the grids was required in order to maximise the correlation , then the mambo image was smoothed to the scuba resolution .",
    "we stress that this method only improves on the robustness of our detections , it does not provide estimates of the 850- and 1200-@xmath0 m flux densities , which have to be measured from the separate maps .",

    "the sixth source , gn1200.42 ( gn850.32 ) , is detected at @xmath23.8@xmath5 . in cases with no detection at 850 or 1200@xmath0 m",

    "conversely , all of the @xmath45-@xmath5 scuba sources are detected in the combined map , while for the @xmath44-@xmath5 scuba sources the corresponding fraction is 18/24 ( 75 per cent ) .",
    "if we instead use table  [ table : mambo - scuba - source - list ] to answer the question ` how big a fraction of the mambo sources have robust associations in the scuba map ? ' , we find that apart from the four @xmath45-@xmath5 mambo sources with scuba counterparts ( a 100-per - cent recovery rate since the fifth @xmath45-@xmath5 mambo source , gn1200.5 , lies outside the scuba region ) none of the other @xmath44-@xmath5 mambo sources have been recovered at 850@xmath0 m .",
    "this is clearly at odds with the high fraction of associations found for @xmath44-@xmath5 mambo sources by g04 in elaisn2 and lockman hole ( @xmath23050 per cent ) and the similarly high rate of associations for bright 1.1-mm bolocam sources in the lockman hole ( @xmath275 per cent  laurent et al .",
    "2006 ) . while positional uncertainties may go some way towards explaining the low fraction of associations in goods - n , the dominant factor is probably the mis - match in sensitivity of the mambo and scuba surveys in this region .",

    "for the randomisation , we only considered positions within the mambo / scuba overlap region . furthermore , since we wanted the simulations to represent similar noise properties to those in the original stacking analysis , each source was assigned a random position 2080arcsec from its original position . from 10,000 such runs  each time with different positions  we found that the observed 1200-@xmath0 m signal occurs on @xmath2420.001 per cent of occasions , while there is a 4 per cent chance of obtaining the observed 850-@xmath0 m stacked signal .",

    "<S> we present a 1200-@xmath0 m image of the great observatories origin deep survey north ( goods - n ) field , obtained with the max planck millimeter bolometer array ( mambo ) on the iram 30-m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the survey covers a contiguous area of 287arcmin@xmath1 to a near - uniform noise level of @xmath20.7mjybeam@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> after bayesian flux deboosting , a total of 30 sources are recovered ( @xmath43.5-@xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> an optimal combination of our 1200-@xmath0 m data and an existing 850-@xmath0 m image from the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) yielded 33 sources ( @xmath44-@xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we combine our goods - n sample with those obtained in the lockman hole and elaisn2 fields ( scott et al .  </S>",

    "<S> 2004 ) in order to explore the degree of overlap between 1200-@xmath0m- and 850-@xmath0m - selected galaxies ( hereafter smgs ) , finding no significant difference between their @xmath6 distributions . however , a noise - weighted stacking analysis yields a significant detection of the 1200-@xmath0m - blank scuba sources , @xmath7 , whereas no significant 850-@xmath0 m signal is found for the 850-@xmath0m - blank mambo sources ( @xmath8 ) . the hypothesis that the @xmath6 distribution of scuba sources is also representative of the mambo population </S>",
    "<S> is rejected at the @xmath24-@xmath5 level , via monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , although the populations overlap , galaxies selected at 850 and 1200@xmath0 m are different , and there is compelling evidence for a significant 1200-@xmath0m - detected population which is not recovered at 850@xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> these are submm drop - outs ( sdos ) , with @xmath9 , requiring very cold dust or unusual spectral energy distributions ( @xmath10k ; @xmath11 ) , unless sdos reside beyond the redshift range observed for radio - identified smgs , i.e.  at @xmath12 .    </S>",
