    "[ 2 ]    our proof of the lower bound in theorem [ int ] uses the theory of electrical networks , which has a well - known connection with square tilings @xcite . in particular a generalization of theorem [ int ] is as follows :    let @xmath24 be a resistor network with underlying graph @xmath25 , with resistances @xmath26 on each edge",

    "the potentials and currents are the unique solution to the equations arising from kirchoff s and ohm s rules with the given boundary conditions @xmath75 .",

    "we can associate , to any planar graph @xmath67 and choice of two vertices @xmath91 on the same face , a square - tiling of a rectangle @xmath66 whose resistor network is @xmath25 .",

    "( see also @xcite ) , the resistance @xmath79 satisfies : @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the number of spanning trees in @xmath25 , and @xmath94 is the number of spanning trees in @xmath95 , the graph obtained from @xmath25 by gluing together vertices @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    ".    thus if @xmath66 is a @xmath0 rectangle , we have @xmath96 , and since @xmath1 and @xmath2 are relatively prime , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "however the number of spanning trees in any graph of @xmath99 edges is less than @xmath100 , since a tree is a subset of edges , and there are @xmath100 distinct subsets of @xmath99 edges .",
    "since @xmath25 has @xmath99 edges , where @xmath99 is the number of tiles , we have @xmath101 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath102 .",
    "this gives the lower bound in theorem [ int ] .",
    "let @xmath66 be a rectangle with aspect ratio @xmath47 ( recall @xmath103 ) .",

    "the remaining untiled portion has aspect ratio @xmath106 in the range @xmath107 .",
    "we show how to tile @xmath66 quickly .",
    "assume @xmath66 is @xmath21 .",
    "the idea is simple : use the greedy algorithm , getting a nested decreasing sequence of rectangles @xmath108 ( the untiled portions ) , each containing a fixed corner of @xmath66 , of aspect ratios @xmath109 , with @xmath110 until some @xmath111 is close to @xmath26 , say @xmath112 for some small @xmath61 .",
    "note then that for @xmath113 we have @xmath114 .    at step @xmath115 , instead of putting in a square , which would result in the new rectangle having aspect ratio @xmath116 , just put in a rectangle of aspect ratio @xmath117 , with its longer side covering the shorter side of @xmath118 .",
    "the remaining untiled portion is a rectangle @xmath119 with aspect ratio @xmath120 , and so @xmath121 .",
    "now continue .",
    "since for each @xmath122 we have @xmath123 , each square added removes either a fraction at least @xmath124 of the area ( in the case when one square is added to a rectangle of aspect ratio in @xmath125 $ ] ) , or a fraction of at least @xmath126 of the remaining area ( in case a rectangle of aspect ratio @xmath117 , which is tiled by two squares , is added to a rectangle of aspect ratio @xmath127 ) .",
    "so the area decreases by a factor of at least @xmath128 per square added .",
    "this quantity is minimized when @xmath129 , and the rate is @xmath130 .",
    "after @xmath50 squares , the untiled area is a rectangle of area at most @xmath131 , and aspect ratio between @xmath26 and @xmath132 , and so is contained in a neighborhood of radius @xmath133 of the corner .",
    "the completes the proof of theorem [ 2 ] .",
    "* the rate of decrease of area @xmath134 is of course not the optimal one .",
    "optimization of similar algorithms seems to be an interesting problem , but one we wo nt consider here .",
    "one might conjecture that @xmath135 is a lower bound for @xmath136 , since the golden rectangle seems to be most easily tiled by the greedy algorithm , which has this rate .",
    "an alternative method for tiling an @xmath21 rectangle is suggested by the following result of hall :    any real number between @xmath137 and @xmath138 can be written as the sum of two @xmath139-aloof numbers .",
    "[ thick ]    here @xmath140 $ ] and @xmath141 $ ] are the minimal and maximal possible sums .",
    "so to tile a @xmath21 rectangle , where @xmath142 , write @xmath143 where @xmath144 are @xmath139-aloof , and divide the @xmath21 rectangle into an @xmath145 and an @xmath146 rectangle with a single vertical line . now tile each of the subrectangles using the greedy method ; by @xmath139-aloofness , in each subrectangle each new square added takes up at least @xmath147 of the area , so that after @xmath148 squares the remaining area is at most @xmath149 of the original area there .",
    "the rate is then @xmath150 .",
    "our method for integral rectangles will be a variant on this method .",
    "let @xmath66 be a @xmath0 rectangle , with @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "we assume as before that @xmath154 : if it is larger , use the greedy algorithm @xmath155 times , so that the remaining @xmath156 rectangle satisfies the above conditions .",
    "we establish in this section an upper bound of @xmath157 for the number of squares needed to tile @xmath66 .",

    "the construction proceeds as follows .",

    "let @xmath160 , and @xmath161 , so that @xmath162 and @xmath163    we divide the rectangle @xmath66 into a @xmath164 rectangle @xmath165 and a @xmath166 rectangle @xmath167",
    ". we will show ( below , after lemma [ sqrt ] ) that we can apply the greedy algorithm successfully to each of these rectangles for a while , that is , until the remaining untiled rectangles @xmath168 each have side lengths @xmath169 for some universal constant @xmath170 ( and @xmath168 have aspect ratios @xmath171 ) .",
    "we then repeat the process , using theorem [ thick ] again to subdivide @xmath168 each in two , applying the greedy algorithm until the remainders have sides @xmath172 , and so on .",
    "we show that at each stage the number of squares added in a single rectangle before we subdivide it is at most the logarithm to the base @xmath173 of its larger side length .",
    "the side lengths decrease by at least @xmath174 before we resubdivide , and each subdivision doubles the number of rectangles . when the edge lengths of a subrectangle are less than the constant @xmath175 in length , simply tile the subrectangle in any way you please .",
    "we derive for the total number @xmath176 of squares needed to tile : @xmath177 where @xmath50 is chosen so that @xmath178 that is , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 is the number of squares needed to tile an integer - sided rectangle whose sidelengths are bounded by @xmath175 .",
    "( note that @xmath181 under the map @xmath174 . )",
    "thus the number of squares is bounded above by @xmath182    it remains to prove our claim that we can tile a @xmath164 rectangle quickly using the greedy algorithm until the remining untiled rectangle has edges @xmath169 .",

    "we can now use the greedy algorithm on the @xmath319 , until the edge lengths are less than @xmath322 , and the untiled rectangles @xmath323 of @xmath324 respectively , are adjacent , have aspect ratios @xmath311 , and are the same size to within a factor of @xmath15 .",
    "( the @xmath323 are not necessarily adjacent to @xmath325 ) .    at the next step",
    "the ell formed by @xmath326 is tiled using the ell method of section [ ellmethod ] and then is subdivided into @xmath248 `` easy '' rectangles ( using theorem [ thick2 ] again ) , and @xmath325 is subdivided using theorem [ thick ] into two easy rectangles . as we continue this process , each ell gives rise to an ell and a single rectangle , and each single rectangle gives rise to an ell .",
    "so the total number of untiled rectangles at the @xmath15th stage of the construction is just the @xmath15th fibonacci number : letting @xmath327 be the number of ells and single rectangles , after one iteration we have @xmath328    as a consequence the number of squares needed to tile is @xmath176 , where : @xmath329 where as before @xmath330 , @xmath180 is a bound on the number of squares needed to tile a rectangle of edge bounded by @xmath175 , and @xmath331 is a constant depending on @xmath15 .",
