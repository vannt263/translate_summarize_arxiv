    "in the context of general relativity , the observable universe seems to be well described by a @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 with locally homogeneous and isotropic spatial sections @xmath2 , and therefore endowed with a robertson  walker metric @xmath3   \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the scale factor and @xmath5 depending upon whether the geometry of the spatial sections is euclidean , spherical or hyperbolic with constant spatial curvature @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 .",
    "the spatial geometry or the corresponding spatial curvature is an observable property , which can be determined by finding out whether the total energy - matter density of the universe , @xmath9 , is equal to , greater than or small than 1 . in consequence , a key point in the search for the spatial geometry of the universe is to use observations to constrain the density @xmath9 .",
    "often the homogeneous and isotropic spatial sections @xmath2 are assumed to be the simply connected @xmath10-manifolds : euclidean @xmath11 , spherical @xmath12 , or hyperbolic @xmath13",
    ". however , the @xmath10-space @xmath2 can also be one of the possible quotient ( multiply - connected ) manifolds @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a fixed - point free discrete group of isometries of the corresponding covering space @xmath18 , @xmath19 , or @xmath20 .",
    "the local geometry of the spatial sections @xmath2 thus constrains , but does not dictate , its topology ( see , e.g. , the review refs .  ) .",
    "the immediate observational consequence of a detectable multiply - connected spatial section @xmath2 is that an observer could potentially detect multiple images of radiating sources . in this way , in a universe with a detectable@xcite non - trivial topology the last scattering surface ( lss ) intersects some of its topological images in the so called circles - in - the - sky,@xcite i.e. , pairs of matching circles of equal radii , centered at different points of the lss with the same distribution of temperature fluctuations ( up to a phase ) along the circles of each pair .",
    "therefore , to observationally probe a non - trivial spatial topology on the largest available scales , one needs to scrutinize the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) sky - maps in order to extract such correlated circles , and use their angular radii , the relative phase and position of their centers to determine the spatial topology of the universe .",
    "hence , a detectable non - trivial cosmic topology is an observable attribute , which can be probed through the circles - in - the - sky for all locally homogeneous and isotropic universes with no assumptions on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the question as to whether one can use the knowledge of the topology to either determine the geometry or set constraints on the density parameters naturally arises here . regarding the geometry it is well - known that the topology of @xmath2 determines the sign of its curvature ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) and therefore the @xmath10-geometry .",
    "thus , the topology of the spatial section of the universe dictates its geometry . in recent",
    "works,@xcite@xcite it has been shown that the knowledge of a _ specific _ spatial topology through the circles - in - the - sky offers an effective way of setting constraints on the density parameters associated with matter ( @xmath21 ) and dark energy ( @xmath22 ) in the context of @xmath23cdm model .",
    "in other words , it has been shown in refs .   and that a circles - in - the - sky detection of specific spatial topology can be used to reduce the degeneracies in the density parameter plane @xmath24 , which arise from statistical analyses with data from current observations .",
    "our main aim here , which are complementary to our previous works,@xcite is to show how one can use a possible circles - in - the - sky detection of the spatial topology of _ globally homogeneous _ universes to set constraints on the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) parameters .",
    "to investigate how a possible detection of a nontrivial spatial topology can be used to place constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameters , we shall focus on the globally homogeneous spherical manifolds and indicate how a similar procedure can be used in the case of globally homogeneous flat topologies .",
    "the topological constraints on dark energy eos can be looked upon as having two main ingredients , namely one of observational nature , and another of theoretical character .",
    "regarding the former , an important point about the globally homogeneous universes is that the pairs of topologically correlated circles on the lss will be antipodal , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .        a straightforward use of trigonometric relations for the right - angled spherical triangle shown in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "yields @xmath25 \\ , , % \\cos \\alpha = \\frac{\\tan r_{inj}}{\\tan \\chi^{}_{lss } } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a topological invariant , whose values are given in table  [ globally - hom - spherical ] , and the distance @xmath27 is the comoving distance to the lss _ in units of the present - day curvature radius _",
    ", @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "now , a circles - in - the - sky detection of a given topology would give a value for the radius @xmath30 along with an observational uncertainty @xmath31 .",
    "these observational data along with eq .",
    "( [ obs_chilss ] ) and the usual error propagation formula , give the observational distance @xmath32 to the lss and the associated uncertainty @xmath33 .",
    "the second important ingredient of the above mentioned topological constraints is related to the theoretical dark energy model .",
    "indeed , the comoving distance to the last scattering surface in units of the curvature radius is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the radius of the lss , @xmath36 is an integration variable , @xmath37 is the hubble parameter , @xmath38 is the curvature density parameter , and @xmath39.@xcite clearly , different parametrizations of the equation of state @xmath40 give rise to different friedmann equations , i.e. , different ratios @xmath41 .",
    "thus , for example , assuming that the current matter content of the universe is well approximated by a dust of density @xmath42 ( baryonic plus dark matter ) along with a dark energy perfect fluid component of density @xmath43 and pressure @xmath44 , for the parametrizations @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( refs .   and ) , and @xmath47 ( refs .   and ) the friedmann equation takes , respectively , the following forms : @xmath48    in order to show how one can use the topology to set constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameters we combine the two above - mentioned ingredients by comparing the observational topological value @xmath32 for a given topology with the theoretical values @xmath49 for any dark energy equation of state parametrization [ assuming a gaussian distribution with mean given by eq .",
    "( [ chilss ] ) ] .",
    "thus , the constraints from a detectable spatial topology are taken into account in a @xmath50 statistical analysis of any parameter plane ( as , for example , @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xmath53 ) by adding a new term of the form @xmath54 to the remaining @xmath50 terms that account for other observational data sets .",
    "a concrete application of this result can be found in ref .  , where by assuming the poincar dodecahedral space ( pds ) as the circles - in - the - sky observable spatial topology , the current constraints on the equation of state parameters for the parametrizations  eq.([xcdm ] ) and eq.([cpl ] ) have been reanalyzed by using type ia supernovae data from the legacy sample@xcite along with the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) peak in the large - scale correlation function of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss),@xcite and cmb shift parameter,@xcite with and without the topological statistical term .",
    "it is shown that the pds topology provides relevant additional constraints on the dark energy eos parameters for the two - parameter chevallier - polarski - linder parametrization@xcite [ eq.([cpl ] ) ] , but negligible further constraints on @xmath55 of eq.([xcdm ] ) .",
    "the authors also show that a suitable gaussian prior on the curvature density parameter @xmath56 can mimic the role of the topology in such statistical analyses .    regarding the flat manifolds , we first note that there are three classes of multiply - connected manifolds of the form @xmath14 which are globally homogeneous , namely the @xmath10-torus class ( compact in three directions ) , the class of chimney spaces ( compact in two directions ) and the slap space class ( compact in one direction ) .",
    "second , eq .  ( [ obs_chilss ] ) clearly reduces to @xmath57 but now since the curvature radius of euclidean @xmath10-space is infinite , one can not identify @xmath58 with the curvature radius .",
    "therefore , in this case there is no natural unit of length , and one has to use , for example , megaparsecs ( mpc ) as unit of length .",
    "hence , the comoving distance to the lss ( for @xmath59 is given by @xmath60    finally , we note that euclidean manifolds are not _ rigid _ : even though topologically equivalent the manifolds of a specific class ( fixed group @xmath17 ) of quotient flat manifolds may have different size .- torus class can be constructed by taking a parallelepiped ( or particularly a cube ) of any size and identifying the opposite faces by translations . ] in this way , the injectivity radius @xmath26 for a class of flat multiply - connected manifolds , is not a topological invariant ( constant ) .",
    "thus , one should estimate @xmath26 on physical grounds , as for example by fitting the cmb data.@xcite    to conclude , we emphasize that the above procedure may be employed for any specific globally homogeneous detectable topology and dark energy eos parametrizations along with an arbitrary combination of data sets .",
