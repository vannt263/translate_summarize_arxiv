    "snow / sand erosion and deposition due to wind emit many deposited particles into the atmosphere , and drifting snow and dust storms are generated as massive particles are transported .",

    "generally , aeolian particle transport is maintained and developed through four physical sub - processes  @xcite : aerodynamical entrainment , wind - blown particle dynamics , splash caused by particle - granular bed collision , and wind modification ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) . in the equilibrium state , the wind profile is almost fixed because of the momentum exchange with particles , whereas the dynamics of particles ejected from granular beds consists of three different modes : creep , saltation , and suspension .",
    "these motions strongly depend on wind speed and particle diameter ; thus , the spatial structure is complex in particle transport .",

    "lagrangian and turbulent diffusion theories , which are remarkable approaches , have been used in the saltation and the suspension layer , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the former reproduces the detailed structure of local transport by computing the trajectory of each particle , but the dynamics of particles are dependent on statistical functions ( hereafter , splash function ) characterizing the splash process .",
    "the latter predicts global transport on actual landforms with the continuum approximation of blown particles , although it is not suitable for transport with high particle inertia such as saltation . in natural fields ,",
    "the granular bed consists of particles of various sizes , and particles entrained from the bed exhibit different motions depending on the diameter .",
    "the collision between a blown particle and the bed ( i.e. , the splash process ) plays a key role in , for example , the formation of saltation and suspension layers , entrainment of new particles , and particle velocity after collision .",

    "<S> we conduct numerical simulations based on a model of blowing snow to reveal the long - term properties and equilibrium state of aeolian particle transport from @xmath0 to @xmath1 above the flat surface . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are s follows . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) time - series data of particle transport are divided into development , relaxation , and equilibrium phases , which are formed by rapid wind response below @xmath2 and gradual wind response above @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the particle transport rate at equilibrium is expressed as a power function of friction velocity , and the index of @xmath3 implies that most particles are transported by saltation . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the friction velocity below @xmath4 remains roughly constant and lower than the fluid threshold at equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) the mean particle speed above @xmath5 is less than the wind speed , whereas that below @xmath5 exceeds the wind speed because of descending particles . </S>",
    "<S> ( v ) the particle diameter increases with height in the saltation layer , and the relationship is expressed as a power function . through comparisons with the previously reported random - flight model </S>",
    "<S> , we find a crucial problem that empirical splash functions can not reproduce particle dynamics at a relatively high wind speed . </S>"
