    "since the pioneering work of giaever,@xcite the tunneling measurement has been a major experimental method for investigations into the electronic states of condensed matter systems.@xcite in the simplest setup , a metal with _ known _",
    "spectral property is made in contact with a material x , forming an nx junction so that the electronic states of x can be probed .",
    "for many years , despite the fact that many insights into the spectral properties of many states have been gained from the differential conductance ( @xmath1 ) curves obtained from tunneling measurements , nonetheless , unlike many other experiments , it is fair to say that there is no clear and solid statement as to exactly what _ bulk properties _ are being probed in tunneling measurements .",
    "for example , it is known that in neutron scattering experiments , the neutron intensity is a measure of the imaginary part of the bulk spin susceptibility , @xmath2 ; no similar statement has ever been firmly established for tunneling measurements .",
    "the difficulty for establishing the relation between the tunneling conductance and the bulk quantities can be traced back to the very existence of the junction interface .",
    "it has been realized that the presence of the interface can change the conductance curve dramatically .",
    "a well - known example is the zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) observed in the tunneling spectra when x is a @xmath0-wave superconductor ( nd junction ) in ( 110 ) direction.@xcite the appearance of the zbcp is entirely tied up with the presence of the interface and its orientations , and therefore can not be obtained by simple calculations based on bulk density of states .",
    "recent theoretical analyses of the zbcp have been mostly concentrated on the nd junctions .",
    "furthermore , they are based largely on the standard btk theory.@xcite in the continuum limit , analytic expressions of the differential conductance for general orientations of the interface were obtained .",
    "numerical calculations were later carried out for the btk theory in the lattice version.@xcite while these works have supplied insights into the zbcp , they are , however , specifically designed for studying the nd junction . moreover , because the relation of the conductance curve to the bulk quantities was not clearly manifested , essentially the numerical computation had to be done individually for each interface orientation .",
    "another technical inconvenience is that the btk theory is a mean - field theory based on solving the mean - field quasi - particle wavefunctions , it is thus difficult in this formulation to take into account the effects of interaction systematically . to extend into the study of other systems , especially those with strong correlations where almost all relevant models are on discrete lattices , it is therefore an urgent need to have a formulation which can go beyond the mean - field btk formulations . as an illustration of our approach , in this paper",
    "we will focus on mean - field analysis of several tunneling problems .",
    "the effects of fluctuations and interactions will be discussed elsewhere .    in this paper",
    ", we shall adopt an approach that is based on the non - equilibrium keldysh - green s function formalism . in the lowest order approximation",
    ", we will be able to express the differential conductance entirely in terms of bulk green s functions and include the interface effects .",
    "thus , the relation of the conductance curve to the bulk quantities is clearly manifested .",
    "the tunneling between n and x will be treated as a perturbation , so that in the zeroth order the green s function is the mean - field _ half - space _ green s function that resides only on the semi - infinite plane and satisfies the boundary conditions to be specified later .",
    "based on the half - space green s function , @xmath3 , higher order corrections can be systematically constructed.@xcite in particular , a class of infinite series in @xmath3 , which consists of all elastic tunneling processes in the perturbation theory , will be considered and summed to all orders for calculating the current across the junction.@xcite to fully take into account the tight - binding nature of the problem , we shall employ discrete models for both the materials n and x and the tunnel junctions .",
    "thus the essential quantity to be calculated is the half - space lattice green s function for the x state . in resemblance to the conventional method of image",
    ", we express the half - space green s function in terms of the bulk green s functions propagating from the real source and a fictitious image source @xmath4 with the factor @xmath5 accounting for the boundary conditions . in this picture",
    "the half - space green s function is decomposed into two parts : the real - source part comes solely from the bulk and hence reveals purely the bulk properties , the image part contains all interface effects which are encoded in the factor @xmath5 . in this way",
    ", the interface effects are clearly identified in the course of the analysis and one can pinpoint any departure from the bulk property .",
    "the factor @xmath5 can be expressed in terms of bulk green s function .",
    "right on the interface , it is found @xmath6 here @xmath0 is an effective lattice constant whose precise meaning will be explained in below . clearly , the tunneling spectrum can be classified according to whether the reflection symmetry is broken or not . in the case",
    "when reflection symmetry is broken with respect to the interface , one has @xmath7 , hence @xmath8 is not unity , possible zero modes may arise due to the presence of zeros in the denominator of the left hand side . _",
    "the number of localized zero mode is thus determined by the order of zeros in the bulk green s function @xmath9 .",
    "_ in the lowest order approximation , the differential conductance is given by the local density of state at the interface @xmath10 where @xmath11 is @xmath3 of eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) evaluated at the interface and @xmath12 is the charge of an electron .",
    "since @xmath8 can be expressed entirely in terms of bulk green s functions , this is then the relation between the bulk quantities and the differential conductance alluded to earlier .",

    "[ model ] , the tunnel junction consists of two truncated two dimensional ( 2d ) lattices connected through a tunnel barrier , with the left half the normal ( n ) electrode ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the lattice constant ) and the right the test ( x ) electrode ( @xmath21).@xcite we take the interface the @xmath22 direction .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system thus comprises two parts : the hamiltonian @xmath23 for the left and right electrodes , and the tunneling hamiltonian which connects the surface points at @xmath24 and @xmath18 @xmath25 here @xmath26 are spin indices , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the @xmath22-coordinates of the surface sites on the left and right electrodes ; @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the corresponding electron annihilation operators .",

    "the normal metal on the left electrode could be in any orientations , and the detail connection between the two lattices may also cause complications in the tunneling spectroscopy . to be definite , however , in our model we fix the lattice on the left side at ( 100 ) orientation and connect its boundary sites to those of the right at @xmath18 ( fig .  [",
    "model]@xmath44 ) . as one can observe easily , the system is translational invariant along the interface direction with period @xmath20 , the lattice constant of the left side .",
    "we exploit this symmetry by making a partial fourier transformation along the interface direction in eq .",
    "( [ i_real ] ) and arriving at @xmath45 the range of @xmath46 is determined by the periodicity of the interface sites along @xmath22 direction , hence @xmath47 we emphasize that the problem is now effectively one dimensional : in eq .",
    "( [ i_ky ] ) different @xmath46 modes are decoupled completely . moreover , only _",
    "quantities are involved .",
    "these are very appealing features especially for the feasibility of our method of image , as we will discuss in the following section .    in the keldysh green s function formulation",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix can be formally solved as a closed time - ordered path integral,@xcite the expectation value @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ i_ky ] ) is then related to the components of keldysh s green s functions over the close time - path .",
    "one can then calculate perturbatively the average current @xmath49 in terms of the zeroth order green s function .",
    "details of this calculation can be found in ref .   and",
    "an outline is presented in the appendix . here",
    "an essential difference from earlier work is that previously the green s functions were obtained through directly solving the equation of motion , while here we shall make use of the method of image elucidated in the following section . in this way",
    "the current approach is more general and versatile , and can be easily applied to various hybrid systems .      in our scheme for the calculation of the tunneling current ,",
    "the building blocks are the zeroth order half - space green s functions ( see the appendix ) . because in the zeroth order , lattices on the left and right sides are disconnected , the green s functions are defined only for each semi - infinite plane . therefore , lattice points on the interface will have `` dangling bonds '' . effectively , as shown in figs .",
    "[ model]@xmath14 and @xmath15 , we are imposing hard - wall boundary conditions at the end points of these dangling bonds .",
    "one thus envisages a method of image similar to that in electrostatics .    in the usual practice , the method of image",
    "is done for the continuum differential equations .",
    "it is based on the principle of superposition and the uniqueness of the solutions.@xcite when applying it to the discrete lattice , one encounters the difficulty that the image point to any source point @xmath50 , may not locate right at the allowed lattice points . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we note that for each semi - infinite lattice there is discrete translational invariance along the surface direction , which we choose as the @xmath22 direction . furthermore , since in the analysis of tunneling problems each electrode is considered to be in steady states , time - translational invariance is preserved in the individual half - space .",
    "in the subsequent sections we shall fully exploit these symmetries and thus will be concerned with the half - space green s function in its fourier space representation @xmath51 , which effectively propagates from @xmath52 to @xmath53 . for each @xmath46 and @xmath54",
    "one is therefore dealing with an effective one dimensional ( 1d ) system ( fig .",
    "[ model ] ) .    as a demonstration of the method ,",
    "let us consider a 2d semi - infinite square lattice with lattice constant @xmath16 extending over the region @xmath55 at orientation @xmath56 .",
    "the hard - wall boundary condition prescribes the half - space green s functions to vanish over the hard walls , which consist of all points where the boundary sites can reach away from the bulk lattice ( figs .",
    "[ model]@xmath14 , @xmath15 ) . for general surface orientations @xmath56 and with only nearest - neighbor ( n.n . ) hopping one can find that the number of hard walls is given by @xmath57 .",
    "let us consider first the single hard - wall configurations , which includes the @xmath58 and the @xmath59 orientations ( when there is no next n.n hopping in the latter ) .",
    "as we shall discuss later , the multi - hard - wall problem are simple generalizations to the single hard - wall cases .    for single hard - wall case",
    "the only hard wall is located at @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the spacing between two consecutive @xmath56 planes .",
    "since the green s function must vanish on the hard wall regardless the position of the source point @xmath52 , one imposes the boundary condition @xmath62 to implement the method of image , we construct the half - space green s function @xmath51 from the full - space green s function @xmath63 as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the image point of the point source @xmath52 with respect to the hard wall @xmath60 .",
    "the green s function @xmath66 describes direct propagation from the point source to the point @xmath53 , while @xmath67 propagates from the image point to @xmath53 .",
    "the factor is determined by fitting the boundary condition ( [ hwbc ] ) , we find @xmath68 here and in the following we suppress the @xmath46 and @xmath54 dependence whenever no confusion would arise . in going from the first to the second expressions above",
    ", we have used @xmath69 , namely that the full - space green s functions are translational invariant along the @xmath53 direction . however",
    ", this is not essential for establishing the method of image .",
    "it is used here only for brevity . for systems without translational symmetry along @xmath53 direction ( such as the @xmath0-density - wave state to be discussed in sec .",
    "[ ddw ] ) , the following discussion still proceeds with only minor modification .    from the half - space green s function @xmath70 ,",
    "one obtains the surface green s function @xmath11 by setting @xmath71 . in the fourier space",

    "the advantage of this formulation is clearly seen from ( [ fourier ] ) : the surface green s function is obtained from combinations of full - space green s functions . for different surface orientations ,",
    "one simply rotates the full - space green s function to the appropriate angle .",
    "furthermore , it is also clear that here we have a scheme for studying the effects of interactions and fluctuations in tunneling problems .",
    "essentially one can take these effects into account through the bulk green s function . here , however , we shall concentrate on mean - field treatments and defer correlation effects to a separate publication .",
    "it is when dealing with lattices with an anisotropic order parameter that one could most easily appreciate the power of the present formulation .",
    "for instance in dealing with @xmath0-wave superconductors , apart from fitting the boundary conditions ( [ hwbc ] ) , @xmath5 also takes care of the different gap structures for propagation along the reflected path and the fictitious path ( such as @xmath75 and @xmath76 depicted in fig .",
    "[ image ] ) . in the presence of reflection symmetry",
    "( such as an @xmath77-wave superconductor , or a @xmath0-wave superconductor at @xmath58 orientation ) , since the gap structure as seen by these two paths are identical , the full - space bulk green s function possesses the symmetry @xmath78 .",
    "therefore @xmath5 becomes ( independent of @xmath46 and @xmath54 ) universally equal to the identity matrix and eq .",

    "[ image ] , width=188 ]    for general orientations or when taking into account next nearest neighbor hopping , as noted earlier , there could be more than one hard walls . in these circumstances",
    "the surface green s function must satisfy the boundary condition that it vanishes on all these hard walls simultaneously .",
    "this is a simple generalization of the single hard - wall problem .",
    "for instance , let us consider the @xmath85 case with n.n hopping : as depicted in fig .",
    "[ model]@xmath15 there are two hard walls located at @xmath60 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "analogous to the single hard - wall problem , we write the half - space green s function @xmath88 with @xmath65 , @xmath89 being the location of the image sources , and @xmath90 , @xmath91 determined by the boundary conditions @xmath92 in other words , for the point source at @xmath52 , each hard wall `` generates '' an image source on the other side of the surface and introduces an @xmath5 factor which accounts for the additional boundary conditions . the half - space green s function is a superposition of contributions from the real and all image sources . to obtain the surface green s function",
    ", one again substitutes @xmath71 into eq .",
    "( [ g_210 ] ) .    before proceeding to the applications in the following sections , we comment that the present method is not restricted to square lattices . in sec .",
    "[ graph ] we will apply this method to systems involving honeycomb lattices . indeed our generalized method of image relies only on the possibility of reducing 2d lattices into 1d structures through a fourier transformation in the transverse direction .",

    "recently , applying this method , we discover a remarkable even - odd effect in semi - infinite 1d chains : for hopping amplitudes with even cycles there can be zero - energy localized edge - states , while for those with odd cycles there is none.@xcite secondly , as already pointed out at the beginning of the paper , for the first time , our method allows us to express what is being measured in tunneling experiments in terms of bulk green s function . for instance , in a single hard - wall configuration , suppose the normal metal on the left is a wideband material and the junction barrier is very high ( @xmath281 in eqs .",

    "the real - source part results purely from the bulk and hence reveals faithfully the bulk property ; the image source part contains all surface effects and hence is responsible for any complications . in the presence of the reflection symmetry",
