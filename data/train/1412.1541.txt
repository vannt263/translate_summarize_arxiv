    "one of the major goals of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiment is the search for heavy resonances .",
    "since a heavy resonance indicates a new heavy particle , its discovery is a clear evidence of the new physics ( np ) beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "especially the existence of an extra neutral gauge boson @xmath1 is a common feature of many np models .",
    "therefore , the lhc has been pushing ahead on the search for neutral heavy resonances in various np models . recently",
    "cms and atlas collaborations have reported the search results for the @xmath1 existed in some np models through the dilepton channels at @xmath57 and 8 tev with the data up to 20 fb@xmath6 , and also through @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and dijet channels with similar or less integrated luminosities @xcite .",
    "although we have not seen a new resonance yet so far , in future experiments , we are still expecting to observe one or more neutral heavy resonance due to various theoretical motivations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the np model with the electroweak @xmath0 gauge group where there are two extra neutral heavy bosons , and probe the search possibility of those heavy bosons at the lhc , especially by embedding anomaly - free set of fermions .    the @xmath9 extension of the electroweak gauge symmetry @xmath10 of the sm has been widely studied by various authors due to its several distinctive features @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting feature is that the gauged @xmath9 group including both quarks and leptons can provide an answer to the question why we only observe three families of fermions in nature , in a sense that anomaly cancellation is achieved when @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of families ( colors ) @xcite .",
    "also , the @xmath0 gauge structure has been recently considered in order to implement the little higgs mechanism by kaplan and schmaltz ( k - s ) as an alternative solution to the hierarchy and fine - tuning issues @xcite .",
    "the noble feature of the models with the little higgs mechanism is that the higgs mass is protected by a global symmetry which is spontaneously broken and so the one - loop quadratic divergences to the higgs mass are canceled by particles of the _ same _ spin ; i.e. , a new fermion cancels a quadratic divergence from a sm fermion .",
    "however , the k - s model has a set of anomalous fermions with a simple family - universal embedding which requires additional fermion multiplets at the scale @xmath13 due to nonvanishing quadratic divergences from light fermions and gauge anomalies .",
    "alternatively , we consider the modified k - s model by embedding anomaly - free set of fermions as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite so that one - loop quadratic divergences for the higgs mass are canceled for all fermion flavors as a continuation of our previous work @xcite .    due to the different gauge group structure and the multiple breaking of global symmetry by separate scalar fields , the neutral currents in this model are fundamentally different from those in other types of the little higgs models ( lhms ) @xcite . in this model with anomaly - free set of fermions , there are two extra massive neutral gauge bosons , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which couple to ordinary sm fermions , while other extra gauge bosons only couple to new heavy fermions .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we mainly focus on the lhc phenomenology of @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons .",
    "similar neutral gauge bosons appear in other @xmath0 models with regular higgs mechanism @xcite , and their low - energy phenomenology is also similar if the fermion family is assigned to be the same @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the mass bounds and the lhc discovery potentials of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons obtained in this paper can be applicable to the models with regular higgs mechanism . for comparison",
    ", we also consider the lhc phenomenology of the @xmath1 boson appeared in the lhm with the @xmath4 gauge symmetry in which the anomaly - free set of fermions are embedded as well @xcite . in order to have a proper higgs mass",
    ", the @xmath14 lhm requires so - called @xmath15-term that manifestly breaks the global @xmath16 symmetry and gives tree - level masses to scalar particles including higgs , which ruins the original motivation of the lhm to acquire higgs mass spontaneously @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the lhc phenomenology of the @xmath1 boson in the @xmath14 lhm is also similar to that of the @xmath1 boson appeared in the usual 3 - 3 - 1 models with regular higgs mechanism @xcite , so we take into account the @xmath14 lhm as a benchmark model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the generic structure of the model is discussed in the next section .",
    "we present the decay properties of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons in the section iii , and obtain the lower bounds on their masses from the present lhc data in the section iv . in the section",
    "v , we study the discovery potentials of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons at the next stage of the lhc with 14 tev center - of - mass ( cm ) energy . finally , we conclude in the section vi .",
    "the lhms adopts the early idea that higgs can be considered as a nambu goldstone boson from global symmetry breaking at some higher scale @xmath17 @xcite and acquires a mass radiatively through symmetry breaking at the electroweak scale @xmath18 by collective breaking @xcite .",
    "especially , the @xmath0 lhm is characterized by the scalar sector based on the non - linear sigma model describing @xmath19 ^ 4 $ ] global symmetry breaking with the diagonal @xmath20 subgroup gauged and four non - linear sigma model field @xmath21 parameterized as _",
