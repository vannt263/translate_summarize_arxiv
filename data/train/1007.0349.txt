    "saturn s rings , like most atmosphereless objects in the solar system , exhibit an opposition effect : a rapid increase in the brightness when the sun - observer phase angle @xmath0 .",
    "most strikingly , this has been demonstrated directly by the zero - phase cassini images @xcite , showing a bright localized spot on the ring location centered at exact opposition .",
    "similarly , hubble space telescope observations during the exceptional 2005 opposition @xcite revealed that the brightness increase continues all the way to zero phase angle : in 2005 , the earth was transiting the sun as seen from saturn , implying a minimum @xmath8 set by the finite solar radius of @xmath9 , with the brightness increasing by about 1/3 for @xmath10 , in addition to a similar increase between @xmath11 .",
    "two main explanations have been offered for the opposition brightening of saturn s rings : 1 ) the intrinsic brightening of the grainy ring particle surfaces , and 2 ) the reduced amount of mutual interparticle shadowing between ring particles , as the phase angle @xmath12 .",
    "the main contributor to intrinsic brightening is likely to be the coherent backscattering mechanism ( cb ) , based on constructive interference between the incoming and outgoing light rays ( akkermans et al .",
    "1988 , shkuratov 1988 , hapke 1990 , muinonen et al .",
    "1991 , mishchenko 1992 ) , although shadow - hiding ( sh ) at the particle s surface ( hapke 2002 ) may also contribute .",
    "coherent backscattering , as well as surface shadow hiding , are complicated functions of the particle surface structure and optical properties of the grains ; these mechanisms are currently topics of extensive theoretical and laboratory studies ( nelson et al .",
    "2000 ; nelson et al .  2002",
    "hapke et al .  2006 , shepard and helfenstein 2007 , shkuratov et al .  2007 ,",
    "hapke et al .  2009 ) .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "the interparticle shadowing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contribution is not sensitive to physical particle properties , but is primarily determined by the optical depth and volume filling factor of the ring . in",
    "what follows , we will consistently call this latter effect `` interparticle shadowing , '' rather than `` shadow hiding '' or `` mutual shadowing , '' in order to avoid any possible misinterpretation in terms of shadows associated with roughness of the surfaces of ring particles .    classically , the strong and narrow opposition brightening of saturn s rings was interpreted in terms of interparticle shadowing in a low volume density ring . near to opposition , the shadow a particle casts on other particles becomes more and more hidden by the particle itself .",
    "the smaller the volume density , the longer the average shadow cylinders are before hiding another particle : a more precise alignment of illumination and viewing is thus needed for this effect to become important . in particular , @xcite calculated the interparticle shadowing contributions for homogeneous b ring models , and showed that the then - existing phase curves could be accounted for solely by this effect , provided that the ring has a low volume density of the order of @xmath13 .",
    "this corresponds in the case of identical particles to a multilayer with a thickness of several tens of particle diameters .",
    "such a low volume density seemed to contradict dynamical models ( e.g.  araki and tremaine 1986 , wisdom and tremaine 1988 , salo 1992a ) that , based on the laboratory measurements of the elasticity of ice ( bridges et al .",
    "1984 ) , predicted that the rings should flatten to a closely packed near - monolayer state with a thickness of few particle diameters at most , indicating @xmath14 .",
    "for such a large volume density , a homogeneous ring would have a much wider opposition effect than the observed brightening .",
    "therefore , mishchenko and dlugach ( 1992 ) and mishchenko ( 1993 ) suggested that the brightening is instead due to cb ( see also muinonen et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "mishchenko ( 1993 ) also argued that cb is strongly supported by the lyot ( 1929 ) and johnson et al .",
    "( 1980 ) measurements of negative linear polarization , whose magnitude drops rapidly within @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , during 1990 s the cb became accepted as the standard explanation for saturn s rings opposition effect , and the cassini vims observations have also been interpreted within this framework @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of the opposition effect solely in terms of intrinsic brightening has a severe problem : improved dynamical models of flattened rings _ do in fact predict _ a fairly narrow interparticle shadowing opposition peak , if a particle size distribution is taken into account ( salo & karjalainen 2003 ; hereafter sk2003 ) .",
    "this is because , for a fixed @xmath16 , the effective mean width of shadow cylinders drops faster than their mean length when the size distribution is broadened .",
    "photometric simulations in sk2003 indicate that the effect is well - matched by hapke ( 1986 ) size distribution models for semi - infinite particle layers .",
    "interestingly , if the currently favored wide particle size distributions with width @xmath17 ( marouf et al .",
    "1983 , french and nicholson 2000 ) are assumed , interparticle shadowing can account for most of the opposition brightening for @xmath18 , and even have a significant contribution for @xmath19 ( sk2003 , french et al .",
    "nevertheless , the strong surge near @xmath20 and the wavelength dependence of phase curves ( french et al .",
    "2007b ) unambiguously show the intrinsic contribution to be present .",
    "therefore , both intrinsic and interparticle shadowing mechanisms are likely to affect the opposition brightening , although it has been surprisingly difficult to disentangle their contributions to the phase curves .     * insert fig 1 here *    in this paper we propose that the _ intrinsic brightening and interparticle shadowing can be reliably separated by a comparison of the opposition phase curves at different ring opening angles_. namely , whereas the intrinsic contribution should be the same regardless of elevation",
    ", the interparticle shadowing contribution is expected to be very sensitive to the viewing elevation .",
    "this prediction follows from dynamical simulations , which indicate a vertically nonuniform particle distribution . as explored in detail in sk2003 , the width of the modeled interparticle shadowing peak gets narrower for more shallow illumination , since the reflection will be more and more dominated by the low volume density upper layers ; see fig .  1 for an illustration .",
    "this @xmath1 dependence of the effective volume density should be further augmented by the particle size distribution , since small particles are expected to have a larger scale height than the larger particles . moreover",
    ", an extended particle size distribution will lead to a narrower opposition effect , in accordance with theoretical calculations @xcite , although a broad particle size distribution alone , without vertical structure , does not imply a @xmath1-dependent opposition effect . to test these expectations",
    ", we will utilize the extensive set of ubvri observations of saturn s rings , obtained with the hubble space telescope s wfpc2 @xcite .    in order to separate the intrinsic and interparticle contributions",
    ", we will employ a set of dynamical simulation models performed with different optical depths and widths of the size distribution .",
    "the opposition phase curves are calculated for these models , covering the range of viewing elevations accessible from the earth .",
    "we then match the observed elevation angle dependence with the simulated one , using the common phase curve range ( @xmath21 ) available for all elevations and filters , and obtain a set of best - fitting size distributions for the different ring components .",
    "the known contribution of interparticle shadowing in these simulation models , for any phase or elevation angle , can then be extracted from the observed data points , to yield opposition phase curves representing just the intrinsic contribution .",
    "the success of the extraction procedure can be tested by the requirement that the remaining intrinsic contribution must depend only on wavelength and ring location , and not on elevation angle .",
    "an additional test for the importance of interparticle shadowing is provided by the b ring tilt effect ( the reflectivity @xmath22 increases with elevation by 30% for the ground based geometries ) , which is traditionally interpreted as resulting from increased multiple scattering at larger elevation angles ( esposito and lumme 1977 , lumme et al .",
    "1983 ) . in sk2003 , we proposed that the tilt effect can also arise due to an elevation - angle dependent opposition effect : at large elevations ( say , @xmath23 as in fig .",
    "1 ) the observed brightness is enhanced by the wide interparticle shadowing opposition peak , which at smaller elevations ( @xmath24 in fig .",
    "1 ) becomes so narrow that it is confined inside the typical observation phase angle of few degrees .",
    "the full hst data set , with sufficient @xmath1 and @xmath8 coverage , and excellent photometric accuracy , offers an ideal tool for testing this hypothesis . as a side result",
    ", we also obtain an accurate estimate for the amount of multiple scattering , and thus set constraints on the intrinsic ring particle phase function .",
    "note that cassini imaging data available to date , though having superior spatial resolution and a broader coverage of phase angles , do not enable such a systematic study of the opposition effect at different elevations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we compare hst data at different elevations .",
    "we show that the observed phase curves are steeper at smaller elevation angles , and moreover that this steepening is independent of wavelength , consistent with what is expected for an interparticle shadowing effect . in section 3 ,",
    "we devise a method for extracting the elevation - dependent part of the opposition brightening , utilizing dynamical and photometric simulations .",
    "section 4 then shows the results of fitting models to the observations , and discusses the implications for the relative magnitudes of the intra - particle and interparticle opposition effects .",
    "the intrinsic opposition effect phase curves are also presented in a tabular form , in terms of parameters for two different fitting formulas ( a linear - exponential fit , and a simplified hapke model including both cb and sh ) .",
    "section 5 discusses the close interrelation between the interparticle mutual shadowing opposition effect and the tilt effect , and uses the observed tilt effect at different wavelengths to estimate the amount of multiple scattering .",
    "section 6 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "there are two previous studies of the opposition phase curves based on a subset of the same hst observations used here . in poulet",
    "et al .  ( 2002 ) , the hst data obtained during cycle 7 for @xmath25 elevation angle were fitted with various models for the intrinsic opposition effect , including the hapke ( 1986 ) shadow hiding model , the drossart ( 1993 ) fractal phase function , and the shkuratov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) model combining coherent backscattering and shadow hiding .",
    "however , no allowance was made for a possible interparticle shadowing contribution , and subsequent hst observations made it clear that the minimum @xmath26 in the data utilized by poulet et al .",
    "( 2002 ) was too large to accurately constrain the models .",
    "french et al .  ( 2007b ) combined the 2005 observations at exact opposition for @xmath27 elevation with the data from cycles 10 - 12 at comparable elevation ( @xmath28 ) , which allowed for much more accurate fits of the phase curves than poulet et al .",
    "( 2002 ) were able to obtain .",
    "in particular , linear - exponential fits , and fits with the hapke ( 2002 ) shadow hiding / coherent backscattering model , indicated that the hwhm of the opposition peak varies in the range @xmath29 .",
    "the effect of interparticle shadowing was studied separately , using monte carlo simulations , which indicated that the observed opposition surge is stronger and narrower than what can be attributed even to a quite extended particle size distribution ( with width @xmath30 ) . nevertheless , the high - quality near - opposition phase curves ( see fig .  2 in french et al .",
    "2007b ) give an impression of possibly two superposed components , the more extended of which might represent the interparticle contribution .      in the current study we use the full hst data set for @xmath31 (",
    "see table i in french et al .",
    "2007b ) , which has been processed and calibrated as described in @xcite . throughout our analysis",
    "we use the _ geometrically corrected _",

    "inclusion of this geometric correction is very important in our case , where observations from different elevation angles are compared with each other . for large @xmath8",
    "there can be significant differences in @xmath1 and @xmath32 , and the correction factor @xmath42 may amount to as much as @xmath7 for low elevation observations . if uncorrected , this spurious effect of variable observing geometries would easily overwhelm the true elevation angle dependence of ring brightness . during a single hst cycle , @xmath33 is more or less constant ( within a few tenths of degree ) although @xmath1 and @xmath32 may vary by a few degrees ( see table i in french et al .  2007a ; fig .  1 in french et al .",
    "this will allow us to group together all data from each individual hst cycle .",
    "in what follows , we will omit the subscript and denote the geometrically corrected observed brightnesses simply as @xmath22 .",

    "for example , the typical b ring @xmath22 is enhanced by about 25% when @xmath8 decreases from @xmath48 to @xmath49 for @xmath47 , but only by about 15% for @xmath50 ( fig .",

    "the figure also shows the @xmath22 profile for @xmath53 , obtained at exact opposition ( french et al .",

    ", this might appear to contradict the importance of interparticle shadowing , which is expected to be very sensitive to @xmath40 .",
    "nevertheless , there seems to be a positive correlation between brightness increase and the local optical depth , as required if at least part of the brightening is due to reduced interparticle shadowing .",

    "to reduce the effect of the discreteness of the simulated particle fields , results from at least five separate particle snapshots are combined in the phase curves .",

    "clearly this is no longer an  opposition effect , \" but relates to a general reduction of shadowing in geometrically thin layers of particles ( see footnote 5 ) . nevertheless , in practice this enhanced @xmath131 has little significance , since it is offset by an even larger reduction in the multiple scattering contribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : discussion_oppo_extended ] right panel ; see also fig .  7 in sk2003 ) . since multiple",

    "( 1993 ) found that the phase curve from voyager images can not be accounted for by classical radiative transfer models , and suggested that this might be due to geometrically thin rings .",

    "moreover , the ring models they use are not dynamically self - consistently calculated size distribution models : they assume a gaussian distribution of identical particles , which assumption is prone to affect the resulting model brightness ( see e.g.  fig .  21 in sk2003 ) . apart from these considerations , there also seem to be some problems in the convergence of their model results when the classical limit should be reproduced exactly ( see their figs .",

    "the characteristics of the b and a ring tilt effects were explored in section 5 .",
    "we showed a new observational result : the strong positive b ring tilt effect seen at @xmath68 ( the phase angle most often addressed in ground based studies ) is significantly weakened when observations at @xmath380 are compared .",
    "we showed that the tilt effect itself , as well as its smaller amplitude as @xmath381 , follow in a natural manner from the same models which match the elevation - dependent opposition effect .",
    "briefly summarized , at low @xmath76 the width of interparticle opposition peak is much less than @xmath48 , so that near - opposition brightening has no contribution to the ring brightness . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath76 increases the opposition peak gets wider , leading to an increased contribution to the brightness .",
    "for example , the best - matching b ring interparticle shadowing model has hwhm @xmath382 , for @xmath383 ( see fig .",
    "8) . clearly , at phase angles smaller than the minimum width",
    ", the interparticle contribution is present regardless of @xmath76 : this accounts for the reduced tilt effect for @xmath55 .",
    "the a ring negative tilt effect was attributed to gravitational wakes , which have a larger effect on the reflection in the moderate-@xmath40 a ring ( and the inner b ring ) in comparison to the densest part of the @xmath1 ring . nevertheless , the shadowing contribution was also present , evidenced by the difference between @xmath68 and @xmath55 .     * insert fig 23 here *    the dependence of the expected b ring tilt effect as function of phase angle is further illustrated in fig .

    "[ fig : discussion_tilt_extended ] is the expected b ring tilt effect for phase angles @xmath385 .",
    "clearly , if the brightening of @xmath131 in the case of non - zero d were limited to near opposition , there would be no shadowing contribution to the tilt effect for @xmath8 larger than the width of the opposition peak .",
    "however , due to the aforementioned general brightening of geometrically thin layers , the tilt effect due to enhanced @xmath131 is present for all @xmath386 : the strength of the effect is proportional to the difference between the various @xmath76 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : discussion_oppo_extended ]",
    ". additionally , for @xmath387 the multiple scattering contribution to the tilt effect should become more and more important .    the effect of elevation - dependent interparticle shadowing , seen in the hst observations , should be present also in the cassini iss , vims , and cirs data , particularly for the recent epoch with low solar elevation .",
    "in fact , the effect might be noticeable also for @xmath388 , for which range cassini data have already been analyzed .",
    "for example , often phase curve data from different tilt angles are combined together : it will be important to determine what influence this has on the fitted parameters ( e.g.  on the hwhm of the opposition peak ) .",
    "also , removing the wavelength - independent interparticle opposition effect will affect the relative amplitudes of the intrinsic opposition peak deduced at different filters : obtaining an unbiased view of the wavelength trends of opposition peak is important for the physical interpretation of the observations .",
    "our plan for the future is to expand our photometric modeling to cover a larger range of observing geometries relevant for cassini , and moreover cover a larger set of dynamical models .",
