    "one of the promising approaches to the higher - dimensional gravity theories is represented by the braneworld models , where the observable universe is a 3-brane ( domain wall ) to which the matter fields are confined , while the gravity field enters the extra spatial dimensions of size that could strongly exceed the planck length scale @xcite .",
    "such models provide an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem of electroweak and quantum gravity scales , as these become of the same order ( @xmath7 ) due to large extra dimensions and could be well tested on the planned supercollider experiments @xcite .",
    "gravity can be localized near the brane at low energies even with an infinite size extra dimension with warped spacetime satisfying the 5d einstein equations containing negative cosmological constant @xcite and an arbitrary energy - momentum tensor allowed on the brane @xcite .",
    "the randall - sundrum model gives 4d einstein gravity in low energies and the newtonian limit appears on the 3-brane with high accuracy .",
    "significant deviations from the einstein gravity occur at very high energies , in the early universe and in vicinity of compact objects as black holes and neutron stars @xcite .    recently , no exact solution of the full 5d einstein equations is know , but there is a variety of astrophysically plausible special solutions of the 4d effective einstein equations constrained to the brane .",
    "such solutions describe black holes with spherical symmetry @xcite or with axial symmetry @xcite and compact objects that could represent neutron ( quark ) stars @xcite .",
    "the black hole spacetimes are determined by geometry of the spherical reissner - nordstrm ( r - n ) and axial kerr - newman ( k - n ) type where the electric charge squared is substituted by the braneworld `` tidal charge '' parameter representing the tidal ( weyl tensor ) effects of the bulk space onto the 4d black hole structure .",
    "astrophysically relevant properties of the braneworld black holes were studied in a series of papers devoted to both motion of matter in their vicinity @xcite and optical phenomena @xcite .    in the simple model of spherically symmetric stars with uniform energy density profile a variety of special solutions having asymptotically schwarzschildian character and satisfying the braneworld boundary conditions were found @xcite .",
    "the most popular is the one with external spacetime described by the reissner - nordstrm geometry with the braneworld tidal charge parameter reflecting the tidal effects of the bulk and related to the energy density and brane tension .",
    "its properties were extensively studied both in the weak field limit @xcite and strong field limit when some restrictions on the brane tension were implied from the data of khz  qpos observed in low mass binary systems with a neutron star @xcite . here",
    "we focus our attention to the interior of the compact objects , namely to the phenomena related to trapping of neutrinos in the so called extremely compact stars ( ecs ) admitting ( by definition ) existence of trapped null geodesics @xcite .",
    "usually , the braneworld tension is assumed positive while the related tidal charge has to be negative @xcite , but the negative tension and related positive tidal charge are not excluded @xcite , so we consider here both positive and negative tidal charge of the compact object .",
    "note that exterior of neutron stars with positive tidal charges can be described by both black - hole and naked - singularity types of the external r - n spacetime ( for details see @xcite ) .    in the standard ( @xmath4 ) internal schwarzschild spacetimes of uniform energy density @xcite with radius @xmath8 ,",
    "bound null geodesics exist being concentrated around the stable circular null geodesic  @xcite . from the behaviour of the effective potential of null geodesics in the exterior , vacuum schwarzschild spacetimes , determining the unstable null circular geodesics at the radius @xmath9 ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", we can conclude that any spherically symmetric , static non - singular interior spacetime with radius @xmath10 admits existence of bound null geodesics .",
    "the trapped null geodesics are then governed by both internal and external barriers of the null geodesics effective potential . , e.g. , in some composite polytropic spheres @xcite . ]",
    "the realistic equations of state admitting the existence of the extremely compact objects were found and investigated for neutron stars , quark stars and q - stars @xcite . for spacetimes with a non - zero tidal charge ,",
    "the situation is more complex as we shall demonstrate in the following .",
    "the existence of bound null geodesics in ecs has interesting astrophysical consequences .",
    "for example , using the notion of the optical reference geometry @xcite it was shown that trapped modes of gravitational waves could influence some instabilities in these objects @xcite .",
    "trapping of neutrinos can be of high importance in the interior of the ecs : first , it will suppress the neutrino flow as measured by distant observers and , second , it can influence cooling of the ecs in a layer extending from some radius depending on details of their structure up to the surface radius .",
    "the cooling process could even be realized in a `` two - temperature '' regime , when the temperature profile in the interior of the star with no trapped neutrinos differs from the profile established in the external layer with trapped neutrinos @xcite modifying substantially the standard picture of the neutron star structure as given in @xcite . in a different context ,",
    "trapping of neutrinos inside rotating neutron stars has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the approximation of free , geodetical motion of neutrinos in the internal spacetime could be used when the mean free path of neutrinos @xmath11 .",
    "neutrinos have inelastic scatter on electrons ( muons ) and elastic scatter on neutrons .",
    "the scatter cross section on electrons ( neutrons ) @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) determines the mean free path by formula @xmath14 where @xmath15  ( @xmath16 ) denotes the number density of electrons ( neutrons ) .",
    "it was shown @xcite that @xmath17 while @xmath18 there is @xmath19  km for @xmath20  mev and @xmath21  km for @xmath22  kev . therefore ,",
    "in a few hours old neutron star , see @xcite , at temperatures @xmath23  k ( @xmath24  kev ) , the neutrino motion could be considered geodetical through whole the internal spacetime .",
    "bound neutrinos with mean free path@xmath25 will slow down the cooling .",
    "of course , they will be re - scattered due to finiteness of the mean free path .",
    "an eventual scattering of trapped neutrinos will cause change of their impact parameter , therefore , some of them will escape the ecs , suppressing thus the slow down of the cooling process in the region of neutrino trapping . clearly , the scattering effect of the trapped neutrinos is a complex process deserving sophisticated numerical code based on the monte carlo method ( we expect modelling of this effect in future ) .",
    "the cooling process deserves sophisticated analytical estimates and detailed numerical simulations . as a first step in considering the role of trapped neutrinos in ecs , efficiency of the neutrino trapping effect",
    "was studied in the simple case of the internal schwarzschild spacetime with uniform distribution of energy density ( but a nontrivial pressure profile ) and isotropic and uniform distribution of local neutrino luminosity , when all the calculations can be realized in terms of elementary functions only ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the influence on the neutrino luminosity of the star is given by a luminosity trapping coefficient relating the total number of trapped neutrinos and the total number of radiated neutrinos ( per unit time of distant observers ) .",
    "the influence on the cooling process is given by two `` cooling '' trapping coefficients : a `` local '' one given by ratio of trapped and radiated neutrinos at any radius where the trapping occurs , and the `` global '' one giving ratio of trapped and radiated neutrinos ( per unit time of distant observers ) integrated over whole the region where the trapping occurs .",
    "in the present paper we study the role of the braneworld `` tidal charge '' parameter on the existence of ecs and estimate its role in the efficiency of the neutrino trapping process using the same trapping coefficients as those introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we consider the trapping effect in the simple case of objects with uniform distribution of energy density .",
    "the external field is given by the reissner - nordstrm geometry @xcite .",
    "this special solution is most extensively studied in the literature , since its external field is identical to those of the black hole solution with spherical symmetry @xcite  therefore , the results of our study could be efficiently compared to the results obtained in studies of other phenomena @xcite .",
    "we consider both positive and negative values of the braneworld tidal parameter  usually , only the negatively valued tidal charges ( corresponding to positive tension of the brane ) are discussed @xcite , but the inverse situation with positive tidal charge is not excluded and will be treated here , since it could demonstrate some new interesting effects .    our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secbrwns ] , we summarize properties and matching conditions of the internal uniform energy density spacetime and the reissner - nordstrm external spacetime . in section  [ secogeoi ] , null geodesics of both the internal and external spacetime are described in terms of properly given effective potential and the ecs are classified according to the properties of the trapping region of the null geodesic motion . in section",
    "[ sectrappn ] , the trapping of neutrinos is discused . in section  [ seceffnt ] ,",
    "the trapping efficiency coefficients are defined for both the total neutrino luminosity and neutrino cooling process , and determined for all kinds of the braneworld ecs . in section  [ secconcl ] , concluding remarks are presented . throughout the paper",
    ", we shall use the high - energy units with @xmath26 , if not stated otherwise . for simplicity , we assume zero rest energy of neutrinos , isotropic emission at each radius , and the period of evolution of the compact stars , when the temperature is low enough to describe the motion of neutrinos by the null geodesics of the spacetime .",
    "we describe the braneworld neutron stars by the simple model of uniform energy density interior and the `` tidally '' charged exterior . we give the internal and external geometry and the matching conditions .",
    "accordingly , we determine conditions on the existence of ecs depending on the tidal parameter characterizing the external spacetime .      in the standard schwarzschild coordinates and the high - energy units , the line element of the spherically symmetric spacetimes reads    @xmath27    the internal solution is characterized by the uniform energy density distribution  @xmath28 , and by the tension of the brane  @xmath29 .",

    "we have demonstrated that the braneworld ecs can be separated into five classes corresponding to five zones of the parameter space @xmath142 where trapping of neutrinos and their motion in the external field of the ecs are realized in qualitatively different way .",
