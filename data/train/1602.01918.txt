    "in the last three decades , there has been great interest in controlling quantum systems for the purposes of coherent control of chemical reactions @xcite@xcite , nmr @xcite , and quantum computation @xcite@xcite .",
    "one of the key challenges of quantum control is counter - acting the influence of the environment , which causes decoherence ( loss of coherence between quantum states ) and dissipation ( loss of energy ) ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for surveys ) .",
    "if one models an open system as markovian and time - independent , the dynamics are described by a quantum dynamical semi - group and the lindblad master equation @xcite@xcite@xcite . while there is research towards engineering open system dynamics@xcite@xcite@xcite , control functions often appear in the system hamiltonian , which are only capable of steering within a given unitary orbit @xcite@xcite@xcite . the motion",
    "_ between _ orbits depends on the lindblad super - operator .",
    "this includes , in particular , variation in the purity @xmath1 , which is constant on any given orbit .",
    "this incentivizes unitary control that is fast relative to the time - scale of the lindblad dynamics@xcite .",
    "one method of representing open systems is the generalized bloch representation @xcite@xcite , which yields an affine differential equation on the vector space of density operators . in this paper",
    "we use a different approach in which the structure of the space of density operators is decomposed into the space of unitary orbits , and the orbit manifolds themselves .",
    "if one has sufficiently fast and complete hamiltonian control for an @xmath0 system , the inter- and intra - orbit dynamics can be turned into a control equation , where the position along the orbit is considered a control variable , and the orbit itself is treated as a state variable @xcite@xcite .",
    "mathematically , the position along the orbit is a _ flag _ : a nesting of subspaces , which in this case are the eigenspaces of the density operator .",
    "therefore , we refer to this viewpoint as flag - based control .",
    "the difficulty in this approach is that the orbit is a non - linear manifold , and applying standard control theory to obtain explicit trajectories is non - trivial .",
    "controllability for @xmath0 can be treated analytically , but not in a way that will scale practically to higher dimensions . at the completely mixed state however ,",
    "the structure of the lindblad term simplifies significantly regardless of dimension .",
    "this paper considers an approach that begins at the completely mixed state , and introduces a continuously varying feedback in the flag , which maintains critical points and zeros of the purity derivative as the purity increases . in this way",
    ", one can plot a thread through @xmath2-space , the so - called bloch ball , that maximizes ( at least locally ) the time - derivative of @xmath1 .",
    "there is a corresponding thread that minimizes the time - derivative ( better said , maximizes it in the negative direction ) .",
    "additionally , a different feedback can be derived that maintains a surface that separates the bloch ball into purity - increasing and purity - decreasing regions .",
    "the purity derivative on this surface vanishes .    in the section",
    "ii , we decompose the lindblad master equation into its inter- and intra - orbit components , and interpret the resulting ode as a control equation . in section iii , we derive a feedback equation that maintains critical points as purity varies .",
    "we consider the special cases where the feedback equation fails . in section iv",
    ", we derive the feedback that maintains zeros . in section",
    "v we show several examples that illustrate the effect of the lindblad super - operator on the bloch ball .",
    "an open quantum system is described by a density operator @xmath2 , which is a trace - one positive semi - definite operator on the hilbert space .",
    "if the dissipation is markovian and time - independent , the density operator obeys the lindblad equation @xcite : @xmath3 + \\mathcal{l}_d(\\rho(t ) ) \\\\",
    "\\mathcal{l}_d(\\rho ) : = \\sum_{m=1}^n l_m\\rho l_m^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}\\{l_m^\\dagger l_m , \\rho \\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the braces indicate an anti - commutator , @xmath4 is the ( hermitian ) hamiltonian , and @xmath5 are the so - called lindblad operators .    for @xmath0",
    ", the density operator can be identified with the bloch vector @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the identification is : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the lindblad equation translates to the following ode ( see appendix a for a derivation ) : @xmath10 here we write @xmath11 and @xmath12 to represent the traceless parts of the operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 , expressed in the basis of the pauli matrices , so that @xmath15 .",
    "the system parameters are defined : @xmath16 where the bar represents complex conjugate and @xmath17 matrix transpose .",
    "@xmath18 is a positive semi - definite matrix , so its eigenvalues @xmath19 must be non - negative . additionally , the vector @xmath20 obeys the inequality ( see appendix b ) : @xmath21    for @xmath22 , the ode can be decoupled into its radial and transverse components . if we write @xmath23 , then @xmath24 , which yields @xmath25 , as well as @xmath26 .",
    "then we have : @xmath27 where the @xmath28 subscript indicates the component perpendicular to @xmath29 .",
    "the behavior at @xmath30 demands attention .",
    "clearly , @xmath31 can be quite large for small @xmath32 , but for trajectories that pass through @xmath33 , it is well behaved . at this point , @xmath34 , which means that shortly before or after",
    ", we have @xmath35 .",
    "it follows that @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the ode s then give : @xmath38 which are clearly bounded .",
    "in a control - theoretic context , we are typically able to choose the hamiltonian @xmath4 to some degree .",
    "the hamiltonian appears only in the transverse equation ( [ transverse ] ) , while the radial component ( [ radial ] ) has no explicit hamiltonian dependence .",
    "we are interested in the question of how to steer the transverse component in order to influence the radial .",
    "we will presume that we have fast and complete controllability , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the absence of lindblad dissipation , we are able to steer between any two points on an orbit in arbitrarily short time ( or at least in a time - scale much shorter than that associated with the lindblad operators ) .",
    "this means we can consider @xmath29 to be an effective control variable : we can search for desirable @xmath39 and then re - construct @xmath4 afterwards .",
    "given this context , we are interested in optimizing the function @xmath40 as @xmath32 varies .",
    "that is , we would like to find the point on an orbit that optimizes the inter - orbit speed .",
    "this can be done using the method of lagrange multipliers for fixed @xmath32 @xcite@xcite , which gives , for the multiplier @xmath41 , the conditions @xmath42 and latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath252 if all lindblad operators are hermitian , @xmath20 vanishes .",
    "this is known as the unital case .",
    "we also have : @xmath253 where @xmath18 is the symmetric matrix @xmath254    since @xmath255 , we can combine these pieces into the following ode : @xmath10",
    "since @xmath18 is a symmetric matrix , it has a natural orthonormal basis . in this basis , we have six system parameters : the eigenvalues @xmath256 of @xmath18 and the elements @xmath257 of @xmath20 , with @xmath117 .",
    "these six parameters must obey two inequalities .",
    "consider the matrix @xmath258 .",
    "@xmath259 is the sum of positive semi - definite matrice , and so itself must be positive semi - definite .",
    "moreover , its real part , which equals @xmath18 , must be positive semi - definite , so we have our first inequality : @xmath260 now the imaginary part of @xmath259 relates to @xmath20 : @xmath261 etc .",
    "if we write @xmath259 in the natural basis of @xmath18 , and take its determinant , we get : @xmath262 since the determinant of a positive semi - definite matrix must be non - negative , we recover the second inequality : @xmath263    p.r . has been supported by the national science foundation and the dfg grant he 1858/13 - 1 from the german research foundation ( dfg ) .",
