    "a paul trap consists of a series of electrodes creating a time - dependent ( radio - frequency ) electric field that enables the trapping of charged particles ( specifically ions).@xcite in its linear configuration,@xcite it provides the capacity of trapping many ions simultaneously along an axis .",
    "the linear paul trap is suitably designed for quantum computing experiments , reducing the coulomb repulsion between the ions at the center of the trapping region , reducing a possible increase in amplitude of the micromotion of the ion.@xcite also , the spacing between electrodes and spacing between ions provide a good environment for laser controlling experiments.@xcite    the difficulty of a numerical treatment of the quantum dynamics of a trapped ion stems from the fact that the trapping potential is time dependent , on a time scale that can be considered slow with respect to the internal dynamics of the ion , and that the motion of the center of mass and the width of the wave function can cover greater than micrometer - sized regions .",
    "wave packet dynamics of trapped ions require thus large spatial grids and long simulation times .",

    "one notable exception is an approximate solution for a breathing wave packet,@xcite which we will address below .    in this paper",
    ", we present a full investigation of the quantum - mechanical motion of an atomic ion in a linear paul trap , using the actual time - dependent trapping potential , using numerical simulations of the spatial wave packet dynamics , focusing our attention on both the trajectory of the center of mass and the width of the wave packet . we compare our results with classical simulations of the ion motion and examine the validity of the effective potential approximation .",
