    "this paper deals with products of @xmath0 random matrices with real entries and unit determinant , i.e. , elements of @xmath1 .",
    "the relevance of products of @xmath3 transfer matrices to one - dimensional disordered systems was already underlined in the pioneering works by dyson  @xcite and schmidt  @xcite . in the context of quantum mechanics in a one - dimensional random potential ,",
    "the exponential growth of random matrix products is at the basis of the phenomenon of anderson localization .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is interpreted as the inverse of the localization length  @xcite . in classical statistical - mechanical models , such as spin chains with random couplings and/or random fields , the lyapunov exponent is the reduced free energy per site  @xcite .",
    "products of random matrices have also received applications in physics besides the one - dimensional realm .",
    "to mention one example , in the context of turbulence it has recently been pointed out that the lyapunov exponent characterizing the motion of inertial particles transported by a turbulent flow can be computed by means of a mapping onto a one - dimensional random potential  @xcite .    besides perturbative weak - disorder expansions of various kinds , numerical investigations , and the lloyd model , with its cauchy distribution of random site energies , which is solvable in any dimension  @xcite , the cases where the lyapunov exponent has been obtained in analytical form are rather few , even in the simplest situation of @xmath3 matrices",
    "these exact solutions concern classical disordered harmonic chains  @xcite , variants of the disordered kronig - penney model  @xcite , the tight - binding anderson model  @xcite , and classical and quantum spin chains  @xcite .",
    "see also the monographs  @xcite and , for more recent examples ,  @xcite .",
    "the success of the calculation in all those cases relies upon special properties of the distribution of the random matrices , with a single random variable whose distribution is simple ( i.e. , exponential or power - law ) .",

    "as we shall see , by using the iwasawa decomposition of @xmath1 into compact , abelian and nilpotent subgroups , one can define a continuum regime in which the lyapunov exponent exhibits a scaling form .",
    "our main finding is that the scaling form of the lyapunov exponent can always be expressed in terms of the logarithmic derivative of a special function ( airy , bessel , whittaker , elliptic , hypergeometric ) .",
    "the present approach can also be viewed as a systematic treatment of the degenerate weak - disorder expansion put forward by zanon and derrida  @xcite ( see sec .",

    "they observed that the integrated density of states per unit length is the ( negative of the ) stationary current of particles or , what is the same , the reciprocal of the mean time that the riccati variable takes to make a complete journey along the real axis",
    ".    in his later study of the frisch - lloyd model , halperin  @xcite made two further contributions .",
    "firstly , he considered the particular limit of the model where the scatterers become infinitely dense whilst their strength becomes infinitely weak ; we call this the _ continuum regime_. secondly , halperin recognised that it was not strictly necessary to know the stationary distribution of the riccati variable in order to find the integrated density of states ; he showed how it could be obtained indirectly by considering a certain _ transform _ of the stationary density .",

    "we remark that , for @xmath67 , the disordered quantum system introduced earlier expresses the matrix @xmath19 as the product of a rotation matrix , a diagonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix : @xmath68 by applying the gram - schmidt orthonormalisation algorithm to the column vectors @xmath69 of the matrix @xmath19 parametrized as in  ( [ mdef ] ) , it is easily shown that _ every _ element  @xmath19 of @xmath1 may be written in the form  ( [ iwasawadecomposition ] ) .",
