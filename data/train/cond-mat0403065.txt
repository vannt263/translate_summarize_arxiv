    "for many years the study of the mechanical behavior of soils was developed in the framework of linear elasticity @xcite and the mohr - coulomb failure criterion @xcite however , since the start of the development of the non - linear constitutive relations in 1968 @xcite , a great variety of constitutive models describing different aspects of soils have been proposed @xcite .",
    "a crucial question has been brought forward : what it the most appropriate constitutive model to interpret the experimental result , or to implement a finite element code ? or more precisely , why is the constitutive relation i am using better than that one of the fellow next lab ?    in the last years , the discrete element approach has been used as a tool to investigate the mechanical response of soils at the grain level @xcite .",
    "several average procedures have been proposed to define the stress @xcite and the strain tensor @xcite in terms of the contact forces and displacements at the individual grains .",
    "these methods have been used to perform a direct calculation of the incremental stress - strain relation of assemblies of disks @xcite and spheres @xcite , without any a - priori hypothesis about the constitutive relation .",
    "some of the results lead to the conclusion that the non - associated theory of elasto - plasticity is sufficient to describe the observed incremental behavior @xcite . however , some recent investigations using three - dimensional loading paths of complex loading histories seem to contradict these results @xcite . since the simple spherical geometries of the grains overestimate the role of rotations in realistic soils @xcite , it is interesting to evaluate the incremental response using arbitrarily shaped particles .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the incremental response in the quasi - static deformation of dense assemblies of polygonal particles .",
    "the comparison of the numerical simulations with the constitutive theories is performed by introducing the concept of _ representative volume element _ ( rve ) .",
    "this volume is chosen the smear out the strong fluctuations of the stress and the deformation in the granular assembly . in the averaging , each grain is regarded as a piece of continuum . by supposing that the stress and the strain of the grain are concentrated at the small regions of the contacts , we obtain expressions for the averaged stress and strain over the rve , in terms of the contact forces , and the individual displacements and rotations of the grains .",

    "the aim of this section is to calculate the macro - mechanical quantities , the stress and strain tensors , from micro - mechanical variables of the granular assembly such as contact forces , rotations and displacements of individual grains .",
    "a particular feature of granular materials is that both the stress and the deformation gradient are very concentrated in small regions around the contacts between the grains , so that they vary strongly on short distances .",
    "the standard homogenization procedure smears out these fluctuations by averaging these quantities over a rve .",
    "the diameter @xmath1 of the rve must be such that @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the characteristic diameter of the particles and @xmath4 is the characteristic length of the continuous variables .",
    "we use here this procedure to obtain the averages of the stress and the strain tensors over a rve in granular materials , which will allow us to compare the molecular dynamics simulations to the constitutive theories .",
    "we regard stress and strain to be continuously distributed through the grains , but concentrated at the contacts .",
    "it is important to comment that this averaging procedure would not be appropriate to describe the structure of the chain forces or the shear band because typical variations of the stress corresponds to few particle diameters .",
    "different averaging procedures using coarse - grained functions @xcite , or cutting the space in slide - shaped areas @xcite , can deal with the question of how one can perform averages , and at the same time maintain these features .",
    "we will calculate the averages around a point @xmath5 of the granular sample taking a rve calculated as follows : at the initial configuration , we select the grains whose center of mass are less than @xmath1 from @xmath5",

    "the classical theory of elasto - plasticity has been established by drucker and prager in the context if metal plasticity @xcite .",

    "here we present a short review of these developments in soil mechanics .",
    "when a granular sample subjected to a confining pressure is loaded in the axial direction , it displays a typical stress - strain response as shown in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : plastic ] .",
    "a continuous decrease of the stiffness ( i.e. the slope of the stress - strain curve ) is observed during the loading . if the sample is unloaded , an abrupt increase in the stiffness is observed , leaving an irreversible deformation .",
    "one observes that if the stress is changed around some region below @xmath88 , which is called the _ yield point _ , the deformation is almost linear and reversible .",
    "the first postulate of the elasto - plastic theory establishes a stress region immediately below the yield point where only elastic deformations are possible .    * postulate 1 : for each stage of loading there exists a yield surface , which encloses a finite region in the stress space where only reversible deformations are possible .",
    "*    the simple mohr - coulomb model assumes that the onset of plastic deformation occurs at failure @xcite .",
    "however , it has been experimentally shown that plastic deformation develops before failure @xcite . in order to provide a consistent description of these experimental results with the elasto - plastic theory ,",
    "it is necessary to suppose that the yield function changes with the deformation process @xcite .",
    "this condition is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plastic ] .",
    "let suppose that the sample is loaded until it reaches the stress @xmath88 and then it is slightly unloaded .",
    "if the sample is reloaded , it is able to recover the same stress - strain relation of the monotonic loading once it reaches the yield point @xmath88 again .",
    "if one increases the load to the stress @xmath89 , a new elastic response can be observed after a loading reversal . in the elasto - plasticity context , this result is interpreted by supposing that the elastic regime is expanded to a new stress region below the yield point @xmath89 .",
    "* postulate 2 : the yield function remains when the deformations take place inside of the elastic regime , and it changes as the plastic deformation evolves . *    the transition from the elastic to the elasto - plastic response is extrapolated for more general deformations .",
    "part ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : plastic ] shows the evolution of the elastic region when the yield point moves in the stress space from @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "the essential goal in the elasto - plastic theory is to find the correct description of the evolution of the elastic regime with the deformation , which is called the _ hardening law_.    we will finally introduce the third basic assumption from elasto - plasticity theory :    * postulate 3 : the strain can be separated in an elastic ( recoverable ) and a plastic ( unrecoverable ) component : *    @xmath92    the incremental elastic strain is linked to the incremental stress by introducing an elastic tensor as    @xmath93    to calculate the incremental plastic strain , we introduce the _ yield surface _ as    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is introduced as an internal variable , which describes the evolution of the elastic regime with the deformation . from experimental evidence , it has been shown that this variable can be taken as a function of the cumulative plastic strain @xcite    @xmath96    when the stress state reaches the yield surface , the plastic deformation evolves .",

    "however , a considerable amount of experimental evidence has shown that in soils the plastic deformation is not perpendicular to the yield surfaces @xcite .",

    "the existence of two tensorial zones , and the continuous transition of the incremental response at their boundary , are essential features of the elasto - plastic models .",
    "although the elasto - plastic theory has shown to work well for monotonically increasing loading , it has shown some deficiencies in the description of complex loading histories @xcite . there is also an extensive body of experimental evidence that shows that the elastic regime is extremely small and that the transition from elastic to an elasto - plastic response is rather smooth @xcite .",
    "the concept of _ bounding surface _ has been introduced to generalize the classical elasto - plastic concepts @xcite . in this model , for any given state within the surface , a proper mapping rule associates a corresponding _ image _ stress point on this surface .",
    "a measure of the distance between the actual and the image stress points is used to specify the plastic modulus in terms of a plastic modulus at the image stress state .",
    "besides the versatility of this theory to describe a wide range of materials , it has the advantage that the elastic regime can be considered as vanishingly small , and therefore used to give a realistic description of unbound granular soils .",
    "it is the author s opinion that the most striking aspect of the bounding surface theory with vanishing elastic range is that it establishes a convergence point for two different approaches of constitutive modeling : the elasto - plastic approaches originated from the drucker - prager theory , and the more recently developed hypoplastic theories .      in recent years",

    "a reduced number of parameters are introduced , which are very easy to calibrate @xcite .    in the theory of hypoplasticity",

    "this non - linearity is reflected in the fact that the relation between the incremental stress and the incremental strain given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hypoplastic1 ] ) is always non - linear .",
    "the incremental non - linearity of the granular materials is still under discussion .",
    "indeed , an important feature of the incremental non - linear constitutive models is that they break away from the superposition principle :    @xmath122    which is equivalent to :    @xmath123    an important consequence of this feature is addressed by kolymbas @xcite and darve @xcite .",
