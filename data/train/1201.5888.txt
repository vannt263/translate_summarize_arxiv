    "massive black - hole ( mbh ) mergers are expected to be the brightest sources of gravitational waves for future space - based detectors such as the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite or a similar mission led by esa ( elisa / ngo , see  @xcite ) or nasa ( sgo , see  @xcite ) .",
    "these detectors are expected to be capable of observing tens or even hundreds of merger events during their lifetime , up to redshift @xmath0 or larger  @xcite , and measure black - hole masses and spins with astonishing accuracy ( @xmath1 for the masses and @xmath2 for the spins , see  @xcite ) . also , they should be able to tell a binary of black holes with aligned spins from one with misaligned ( and therefore precessing ) spins by looking at the higher - order harmonics of the gravitational waveforms  @xcite .",
    "massive black holes are also expected to play a crucial role in galaxy formation : in fact , in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) accretion onto the central mbh is believed to power jets or disk winds capable of exerting a feedback on the growth of structures , by ejecting gas from the interstellar medium ( ism ) and from the intergalactic medium ( igm )  @xcite , therefore quenching star formation in low - redshift , massive galaxies .",
    "indeed , this feedback mechanism is a central ingredient of our current understanding of galaxy formation , because it helps explaining why large dark - matter halos present low baryonic masses , resulting in a sharp cutoff at the high - mass end of the stellar mass function that is not observed in the halo mass function @xcite .",
    "also , it helps making sense of the so - called `` anti - hierarchical '' evolution ( or `` downsizing '' ) of baryonic structures , i.e. the fact that the most massive galaxies are dominated by old stellar populations , while low - mass galaxies generally present young stellar populations and longer - lasting star - formation activity  @xcite , thus suggesting that massive galaxies assemble at higher redshift than low - mass ones .",
    "naively , this behavior may seem in contrast with the `` bottom - up''formation of dark - matter halos , which assemble hierarchically by a series of mergers , but it can be reproduced , at least in its main features , by semianalytical galaxy - formation models including the effect of agn feedback  @xcite .",
    "this link between mbhs and the larger - scale galactic properties works also in the opposite direction , because it is the amount of cold gas present in galactic nuclei that regulates accretion onto the mbhs , and therefore their mass and spin evolution .",
    "also , the 100-pc scale circumbinary disks that are thought to form after gas - rich mergers of galaxies  @xcite exert torques on the spins of the mbhs , aligning them by the time the binary s separation has shrunk to @xmath3 pc  @xcite , and further spin alignment occurs from this separation to the merger as a result of post - newtonian resonances  @xcite .",
    "not only do these effects profoundly influence the spin and mass evolution  because if the black - hole spins are aligned before the merger , the spin of the final black hole is larger  @xcite and its mass lower  @xcite  but they also affect whether the mbh resulting from the merger remains in the galaxy or gets ejected .",
    "in fact , numerical - relativity simulations of black - hole binaries have shown that mergers can produce final black holes with large kick velocities relative to the center of mass of the initial binary configuration , due to anisotropic emission of gravitational waves .",
    "in particular , for equal - mass configurations with initial black - hole spins lying on the orbital plane of the binary , the kick velocity can be as large as 2500 - 4000 km / s  @xcite , and velocities as high as 5000 km / s may occur for configurations with off - equatorial spins  @xcite .",
    "such velocities are larger than the typical galaxy escape velocities , thus leading to the staggering conclusion that most galaxies may not host a mbh",
    ". this would be in stark contrast with observations that most galaxies do host a mbh at low redshifts , and it may be bad news for hierarchical galaxy formation models , which as mentioned above heavily rely on the feedback from mbhs .",
    "however , for binaries with aligned spins the kick velocity is considerably lower and typically not sufficient for ejecting the final black hole from the galaxy .",
    "because , as mentioned above , circumbinary disks tend to align the black - hole spins prior to mergers , it is clear that tracking the evolution of gas in galaxies is crucial to correctly predict how many galaxies host a mbh , let alone the mbh mass and spin evolution .",
    "what makes galaxy formation a difficult problem is the huge range of scales that are involved , which go from the gpc scale of the present cosmological horizon and the mpc scale of typical @xmath4 galactic halos , through the 10-kpc scale of galactic disks and kpc scale of galactic spheroids , down to the 100-pc scale of circumbinary disks and pc scale of mbh accretion disks , and finally to the @xmath5@xmath6 pc scale at which mbh mergers take place .",
    "this huge dynamical range , together with the complex nature of the processes , often nonlinear and dissipative , that take place on small scales ( `` subgrid physics '' ) , makes the problem very difficult to solve numerically in full generality .",
    "in fact , while the current paradigm of cosmological structure formation ( the @xmath7cdm model ) has enjoyed remarkable success in reproducing large - scale observations [ such as the cosmic microwave background fluctuations  @xcite ; the large scale clustering of galaxies ( @xcite , and references therein ) ; the cosmic shear field measured through weak gravitational lensing ( @xcite and references therein ) ; the small scale power spectrum of lyman - alpha forest sources  @xcite ; the number density of galaxy clusters ( @xcite and references therein ) ] , a global understanding of galaxy formation can presently be attempted only by means of semi - analytical models  @xcite , or more ambitiously with hydrodynamical simulations .    in this paper",
    "we use a semianalytical model for the formation of galaxies in a @xmath7cdm universe to study the evolution of the spins and masses of mbhs in a self - consistent way , taking into account both the feedback of the mbhs on the growth of structures and the influence of the galactic nuclear gas on the mbh accretion history and on the spin - alignment prior to mergers ( which in turns affects the spin evolution , as well as the kick velocities of mbhs and thus their possible ejection from galaxies ) . for the purpose of this investigation",
    ", we adopt the widely accepted scenario in which the igm collapses into disk structures , which give rise to bulges ( `` spheroids '' ) when disrupted by major ( i.e. comparable - mass ) galactic mergers , or when they become self - gravitating and develop bar - instabilities . to describe the evolution of dark - matter halos",
    ", we use a full extended press - schechter merger tree based on @xcite , and then evolve the baryonic components along the merger - tree branches , employing analytical prescriptions at the `` nodes '' of the tree to mimic the effects of the mergers , and taking into account environmental effects ( tidal stripping , tidal evaporation and dynamical friction ) using the results of @xcite .",
    "the mbh are evolved within this model starting from two possible scenarios for their seeds , namely a light - seed ( @xmath8 ) scenario  in which the mbhs form as remnants of pop iii stars at @xmath9  @xcite  and a heavy - seed ( @xmath10 ) scenario  in which mbhs form from the collapse of massive protogalactic disks at @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the mbhs are then evolved along the `` branches '' of the merger tree , using the `` reservoir '' model of  @xcite to describe the gas present in the nuclear region , and taking into account the feedback they exert on the growth of structure by means of accretion - powered jets . as for the accretion mechanism ,",
    "we follow @xcite and assume that the nuclear cold gas accretes coherently ( i.e. , with a fixed angular momentum direction ) onto the mbh in a gas - rich environment , thus resulting in a steady increase of the mbh spin  @xcite . in a gas - poor environment , due to the absence of a rotationally supported structure , we assume that the mbh accretes chaotically ( i.e. in lumps of material with essentially random orientations of the orbital angular momentum ) , which results on average in a decrease of its spin  @xcite .",
    "similarly , prior to a mbh merger , we assume that the mbh spins are aligned due to the gravito - magnetic torques exerted by the circumbinary disk if the nuclear environment is gas rich ( `` wet merger '' ) , whereas we assume that they are randomly oriented in a gas - poor nuclear environment ( `` dry merger '' )  @xcite .",
    "we stress this idealized picture will be at least partially modified by processes such as star formation and feedback , which can inject energy and angular momentum into the circumnuclear disk and potentially break the coherence of the accretion flow .",
    "however , recent simulations by @xcite show that these effects are probably not sufficient to create strongly turbulent environments and completely randomize the orbits of the accreting gas in the case of quasars fed by galaxy mergers , and that in these systems the accretion flow retains , at least partially , its coherence",
    ". the situation could be different for quasars fed by disk instabilities at high redshifts , where cold flows are important and accretion may take place by massive clumps ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , these clumps are expected to infall from large - scale disks , and might retain at least partially the disk s angular momentum down to the mbh .",
    "in fact , observational hints for at least partial alignment come from the results of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who studied the relative orientation between agns and their host galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey , finding that random orientations are ruled out at high confidence .",
    "the effect of mbh mergers is accounted for by using analytical formulas reproducing the results of numerical - relativity simulations .",
    "in fact , while the latter are the only way to study black - hole mergers rigorously , these simulations are very time - expensive and are not a viable option to cover the whole parameter space of black - hole binaries .",
    "recently , the interface between numerical and analytical relativity has produced a number of approaches which employ a combination of post - newtonian theory , general - relativistic perturbation theory and/or fits to numerical data to reproduce different aspects of black - hole binaries , such as the gravitational waveforms ( see for instance the effective - one - body approach , e.g.  @xcite , or the hybrid waveforms , e.g. @xcite ) , the kick velocity  @xcite , the final mass  @xcite and the final spin  @xcite .",
    "for this investigation , we use the formula of @xcite for the spin , the formulas of  @xcite for the mass , and the formula of  @xcite for the kick velocity .    because we track the evolution of baryonic structures , and in particular of the gas present in galactic nuclei , along the dark - matter merger trees , we can attempt to discriminate between chaotic or coherent accretion onto the mbhs , and between aligned - spin and precessing - spin mbh mergers .",
    "this improves upon previous models , e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which considered _ either _ chaotic _ or _ coherent accretion , and _ either _ aligned _ or _ misaligned mergers .",
    "we stress that lisa / sgo or elisa / ngo will be able to test our model not only by measuring the mbh masses and spins as a function of redshift  @xcite , but for each merger event it should also be able to determine whether the mbh binary has precessing or aligned spins , by looking at the higher order harmonics of the gravitational waveforms  @xcite .",

    "we assume a flat @xmath7cdm cosmology with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "for the dark - matter merger and accretion evolution , we adopt the extended press - schechter formalism of  @xcite , as modified by @xcite .",
    "this algorithm reproduces the statistical properties of the dark - matter merger trees produced with cosmological numerical n - body simulations  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we start our merger trees at an initial redshift @xmath18 in the case of a light - seed mbh scenario ( in which mbhs form as remnants of pop iii stars  @xcite ) , while in the case of a heavy - seed scenario , in which mbhs form from the collapse of massive protogalactic disks  @xcite , we start our merger trees at @xmath19 . in the light - seed scenario , we assume that a halo of total mass @xmath20 forming at @xmath21 contains a black - hole seed with mass @xmath22 if @xmath23 .",
    "this corresponds to populating halos collapsing from the large-@xmath24 peaks of the primordial density field  @xcite .",
    "corresponds to the cosmological jeans mass collapsing at @xmath18 from the @xmath25-peaks of the primordial density field  @xcite . ] in the heavy - seed scenario , instead , we place black - hole seeds with mass @xmath26 in halos forming at @xmath27 with virial mass  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the halo spin parameter that we will introduce shortly . in both scenarios , because little is known about the spin of the seeds , we choose the spin parameter @xmath30 of each black - hole seed randomly from a uniform distribution @xmath31 .",
    "we stress , however , that the predictions of our model , and in particular those regarding the spins of mbhs , are qualitatively independent of this assumption as long as ones looks at mbhs of mass @xmath32 .",
    "this is because a black hole loses memory of its initial spin when it accretes a mass comparable to its own ( i.e. , if a black hole of mass @xmath33 accretes coherently , which as we will show is the case at high redshifts , its spin becomes maximal after accreting a mass @xmath34  @xcite ) .",
    "also , when it forms , a halo of total mass @xmath20 is assumed to contain unprocessed hot gas ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : baryons ] ) with mass @xmath35 , where the baryonic collapse fraction @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 with @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 ) .",
    "the filtering mass as a function of redshift , @xmath40 , accounts for the effect of the ionizing extragalactic uv background produced by massive stars and quasars , which is able to partially reduce the baryonic content in low - mass systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we calculate @xmath40 using the equations in appendix b of @xcite , assuming @xmath41 and @xmath42  @xcite ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively correspond to the redshift at which multiple hii regions overlap , and to the redshift at which most of the medium is ionized ) .",
    "after the initial formation redshift , additional hot gas is brought in from the igm by the dark matter that accretes onto the halo , and we therefore assume @xmath45 where the baryonic collapse fraction @xmath36 is given again , as a function of redshift , by eq .  .    the resolution @xmath46 of the merger trees ( i.e. , the mass scale below which matter is assumed to accrete on an existing halo rather than give rise to a merger ) is chosen to keep the computational time to acceptable levels while following the dark - matter halos ( and the baryonic components within them ) to very high redshifts . in particular , we set @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the final mass of the halo at @xmath12 . the value of @xmath46 at @xmath12 is comparable or smaller than the resolutions typically used by semianalytical galaxy formation models ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and the redshift dependence is introduced following @xcite in order to track the merger tree to high redshifts . however , because our simulations are computationally rather expensive ( especially for large virial masses ) , in order to further cap the computational time while ensuring a range of masses that is sufficient to allow both minor and major mergers at all redshifts , at each redshift step we also stop following the branches that have mass smaller than @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the mass of the most massive halo at that redshift .",
    "the virial radius @xmath52 of a halo is related to its mass @xmath20 by the standard relation @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the critical density , and where the density contrast at virialization , @xmath55 , is calculated following @xcite .",
    "the halo density is assumed to be described by the fitting function of @xcite ( nfw ) @xmath56 truncated at the virial radius of the halo . the scale radius @xmath57 of the nfw profile",

    "if the cooling time of the hot gas is shorter than its free - fall time , given approximately , at each radius , by @xmath92 ( where @xmath93 is the nfw average density within a radius @xmath94 ) , then the hot - gas phase cools `` fast '' and undergoes gravitational collapse . if instead the cooling time is longer than the free - fall time , then the cooling is `` slow '' and the hot gas cools down through a sequence of quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium states .",

    "however , on top of this `` classical '' picture employed already by early semianalytical galaxy - formation models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , we also include the effects of cold accretion flows  @xcite , which have been shown to be the predominant mechanism leading to the formation of low - mass systems . in halos with mass lower than the critical mass @xmath97\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and @xmath99 , we assume that all the gas accreted from the igm is _ not _ shock heated to the halo s virial temperature , but streams in on a dynamical time  @xcite , thus enhancing star formation at high redshifts relative to the scenario where the accreting gas is shock heated . from the point of view of our model , this is equivalent to assuming directly @xmath100 in ( [ hot_gas_coll ] ) , for halos with @xmath101 . finally , in order to mimic the effect of ram pressure  @xcite and clumpy accretion  @xcite , which are expected to quench the cooling of the hot gas at low redshifts in large halos , we set @xmath102 to the hubble time in halos with @xmath103 and @xmath104 .      for the growth of the baryonic structures ,",

    "for instance , @xcite have to consider the two possibilities separately ( i.e. , either all mergers are assumed to be wet or all mergers are assumed to be dry ) because their model only includes dark - matter halos and mbhs and does not describe the baryonic components ; @xcite model in great detail the gravito - magnetic interaction of a single mbh with its own accretion disk , but do not include the disk s effect on the spin alignment prior to a black - hole merger , and consider only dry mergers . because it keeps consistently track of the evolution of the baryonic matter , our model offers a natural way to distinguish between wet and dry mbh mergers .",
    "this is important for the spin evolution of mbhs , because the spin distribution of the mbh population coming from a model with only wet mergers differs drastically from that coming from a model with only dry mergers ( see fig . 4 in @xcite ) . also , dry mergers tend to give large kick velocities , in principle sufficient to eject the remnant mbh from the galactic nucleus , because the spins prior to merger are randomly oriented .",

    "this comparison needs to be performed carefully , however , because as explained above the mbh merger happens _",

    "we stress that in spite of the rather high ejection probability in the mergers between seeds that one can observe in figs .",
    "[ mergers_light ] and  [ mergers_heavy ] , our model correctly reproduces the property of mbhs at low redshifts , as we showed in the previous section . in other words ,",
    "the gravitational recoil does not succeed at rooting out all the mbhs from their host galaxies .",
    "this is essentially because the occupation fraction of black - hole seeds at high - redshifts is smaller than 1 ( cf .",
    ", in sec .",
    "[ sec : dm ] , how we populate high - redshift halos with black - hole seeds ) , and this is enough to ensure that mbhs survive to low redshifts  @xcite .",
    "also , as noted by @xcite , even if we populated all halos with black - hole seeds at high redshift , the gravitational recoil in the first generation of mergers would automatically decrease the mbh occupation fraction , and even in the case of very high ejection probabilities the occupation fraction would settle to @xmath321 % in a few more merger generations .",

    "this model can potentially reproduce the observed downsizing of baryonic structures more naturally than standard semianalytical galaxy - formation models  @xcite , and may potentially have effects on the predictions for the mbh merger rates and mass evolution . as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : calibration ] , the standard galaxy - formation model that we adopt here , in which disk galaxies form first and give rise to spheroids by instabilities and major mergers , predicts the presence of a significant number of outliers in the @xmath339 and @xmath340 relations , while mbhs settle on the @xmath339 and @xmath340 relations earlier in the case of this `` two - phase '' model ( see @xcite ) . this is because spheroidal structures form first , and as a result of radiation drag they feed the mbhs at higher redshifts than in the `` standard '' model .",
    "clearly , in such a scenario one does not have high - redshift mergers between galaxies with little or no bulges , and therefore the ejection rate of black - hole seeds should be significantly reduced .",
    "also , the earlier growth of the mbhs may boost the event rates for lisa / sgo or elisa / ngo in the light - seed scenario .",
    "we will explore in detail the effects of this alternative galaxy - formation model on the mbh mergers and evolution in a future paper .    finally , as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the results of this section depend on our assumption that the mbh spins gets aligned by gravitomagnetic torques in gas - rich environments .",
    "however , due to processes such as star formation and feedback in the circumnuclear disk  @xcite or clump formation in high-@xmath69 disk galaxies  @xcite , this alignment is likely to be only partial , which may result in higher ejection rates for the mbhs resulting from mergers .",

    "[ spin_evolution_light ] ( light - seed scenario ) and  [ spin_evolution_heavy ] ( heavy - seed scenario ) , we present results for the distribution of masses and spins of the mbhs residing in isolated galaxies or in the central galaxies of groups or clusters ( i.e. , we do not consider the mbhs residing in satellite galaxies ) , at redshifts ranging from @xmath399 to @xmath12 .",

    "this is because at high redshifts , where the agn feedback is still ineffective and the mbhs small , large amounts of gas are present in galactic nuclei , and the mbh spins grow as a result of wet , spin - aligned mergers ( cf . sec .",
    "[ sec : predictions1 ] ) and most importantly because accretion onto the mbhs is coherent and spins them up ( cf .",
    "[ smbh_evolution ] ) .",
    "we stress , as already mentioned in the introduction , that effects such as star formation and feedback in the circumnuclear disk , or the formation of clumps in high - redshift disk galaxies fed by cold streams , may at least partially randomize the accretion flows in gas - rich environments . as a result ,",

    "[ spin_evolution_light ] and  [ spin_evolution_heavy ] at high redshift may be substantially reduced ( e.g. @xcite show that for quasars in merger remnants , sustained accretion results asymptotically in spins parameters @xmath403 ) .    at smaller redshifts",
    "this trends gets modified because the cold gas in the nuclear regions of galaxies becomes scarcer , hence mergers tend to happen in dry environments ( cf .",
    "[ sec : predictions1 ] ) and accretion turns chaotic .",
    "chaotic accretion , in particular , appears to be the main driving force behind the spin evolution in this phase , as can be seen from the appearance of a large number of mbhs with spin parameter @xmath404 .",
    "this is indeed what would be expected in a chaotic - accretion scenario , where the black - hole spin oscillates around a small non - zero value  @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the value @xmath404 is easily explained . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ smbh_evolution ] , accretion turns chaotic when the mass of the gaseous reservoir drops below the black hole s mass ( `` dry '' environment ) . assuming that the mbh is almost maximally spinning as a result of the previous phase of coherent accretion",
    ", we can calculate the spin of the mbh when the reservoir has been completed accreted by integrating eq .   from an initial spin @xmath405 , and assuming that the mbh accretes a mass of gas @xmath406 . doing so , one gets a final spin @xmath407 , which explains the large number of mbh with spin @xmath404 at low redshifts .",
    "the evolution of the spins is qualitatively similar in the heavy - seed scenario , with the difference that no mbhs with @xmath408 are present , because of the seed - model described in sec .",
    "[ sec : dm ] .",
    "we stress that our results , and in particular the dichotomy between almost maximal spins at high redshifts and small spins at @xmath409 , are qualitatively independent of our assumption that the seeds are initially assigned spin parameters drawn from a uniform distribution @xmath410 , at least for mbh masses @xmath32 . while it is unclear whether such a spin - parameter distribution makes sense physically , because little",
    "is known about the spins of the seeds , at high redshifts the mbhs accrete coherently , and they lose memory of their initial spin after accreting a mass comparable to their own ( i.e. , if a black hole of mass @xmath33 accretes coherently , its spin becomes maximal after accreting a mass @xmath34  @xcite ) .    in both the light and heavy - seed scenario , it would seem that the paucity of mbhs with large spins might be in contrast with the iron k@xmath204 measurements of the mbh spins in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and in ngc3783 , which were claimed to be respectively @xmath411  @xcite and @xmath412  @xcite at 90% confidence level .",
    "it should be noted , however , that both these measurements are still controversial , with @xcite finding @xmath413 for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and @xmath414 for ngc3783 , and with other iron k@xmath204 measurements of mbh spins giving smaller values , e.g. a spin between 0.3 and 0.77 , according to the measurement , for fairall 9  @xcite .",
    "even more importantly , these spin measurements are necessarily biased by selection effects , because large spins correspond to higher emission efficiencies @xmath190 and therefore higher agn luminosities  @xcite . moreover , iron k@xmath204 measurements are of course only possible in systems with accretion disks in the first place ( i.e in agns ) , and those systems are expected to host mbhs with high spins because coherent accretion spins them up to the maximal limit ( cf .",
    "[ smbh_evolution ] ) .",
    "we have utilized a semianalytical galaxy - formation model to track the evolution and mergers of the dark - matter halos , the igm , the baryonic structures ( galactic disks and spheroids , in both their gaseous and stellar components ) , and the mbhs that are thought to reside in the center of galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the mbhs is deeply entangled with that of their host galaxies , because it is the star formation in the galactic spheroid that funnels gas to the galactic center via e.g. radiation drag .",
    "this creates a reservoir that feeds the mbh , but the character of the accretion process ( coherent or chaotic ) depends on the amount of gas present in this reservoir .",
    "similarly , when two mbhs merge after their host galaxies have coalesced , their spins get aligned prior to the merger due to gravito - magnetic torques if enough gas is present in the galactic nucleus , while the orientation of the spins remains essentially isotropic in gas - poor environments .",
    "a further complication to this picture is that the mbhs also backreact on the larger - scale galactic evolution , through the so - called agn feedback , i.e. they are thought to quench star formation in high - mass systems by injecting energy into the igm via strong jets or accretion - disk winds .",
    "indeed , the agn feedback is a crucial ingredient of modern galaxy - formation models , and is needed to explain the `` anti - hierarchical '' evolution ( or `` downsizing '' ) of baryonic structures , i.e. the fact that the most massive galaxies are dominated by old stellar populations , while low - mass galaxies generally present young stellar populations and longer - lasting star - formation activity .    in this paper",
    ", we have made an attempt to study how this complicated interdependence between mbhs and their host galaxies affects the black - hole mass and spin evolution , considering both a scenario where mbhs form from `` light '' @xmath415 seeds at @xmath416 and one where they form from `` heavy '' @xmath417 seeds at @xmath418 .",
    "besides confirming that these two scenarios may be observationally distinguishable with lisa / sgo or a similar european gravitational - wave mission ( elisa / ngo ) by simply looking at the observed event rate for mbh mergers , we have studied the mbh mass and spin evolution in detail . in particular , we have determined that accretion is mostly coherent and mbh mergers happen in gas - rich environments at high redshifts , while at low redshifts , when agn feedback , ram pressure and clumpy accretion have `` sterilized '' the galaxy , accretion becomes mainly chaotic and mergers happen in gas - poor environments .",
    "this results in a spin distribution that is skewed towards large spins at high redshifts , and towards spins @xmath404 at low redshifts , a prediction that will be readily testable by lisa or a similar mission .    in principle ,",
    "lisa / sgo or elisa / ngo will also be capable of testing our predictions for the character of mbh mergers as function of redshift directly , because gas - rich mergers tend to present aligned spins , while gas - poor mergers tend to present randomly oriented spins , and these different orientations will produce an effect on the higher - order harmonics of the gravitational waveforms .",
    "we will examine this more in detail in future work aiming at calculating the elisa / ngo signal - to - noise ratios and the effect of higher - order harmonics .",
    "in particular , to accurately model the gravitational waveforms for spinning black - hole binaries we will employ the effective - one - body model of @xcite , which successfully reproduces the exact ( i.e. numerical - relativity ) waveforms both in the extreme - mass ratio limit  @xcite and in the comparable - mass case  @xcite .",
    "finally we have briefly hinted at how the mass evolution of mbhs and the event rates for lisa / sgo or elisa / ngo may be different in alternative galaxy - formation models such as the `` two - phase '' model of @xcite .",
    "this model reproduces the downsizing of cosmic structures more naturally than the standard galaxy - formation model that we consider in this paper , and predicts that galactic spheroids and mbhs should grow earlier than in the `` standard '' model , which might result in larger event rates for lisa / sgo or elisa / ngo ( at least in the case of light mbh seeds ) .",

    "<S> future space - based gravitational - wave detectors , such as lisa / sgo or a similar european mission ( elisa / ngo ) , will measure the masses and spins of massive black holes up to very high redshift , and in principle discriminate among different models for their evolution . </S>",
    "<S> because the masses and spins change as a result of both accretion from the interstellar medium and the black - hole mergers that are expected to naturally occur in the hierarchical formation of galaxies , their evolution is inextricably entangled with that of their galactic hosts . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the amount of gas present in galactic nuclei regulates the changes in the black - hole masses and spins through accretion , and affects the mutual orientation of the spins before mergers by exerting gravito - magnetic torques on them . on the other hand , massive black holes </S>",
    "<S> play a central role in galaxy formation because of the feedback exerted by agn activity on the growth of structures . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the mass and spin evolution of massive black holes within a semianalytical galaxy - formation model that follows the evolution of dark - matter halos along merger trees , as well as that of the baryonic components ( hot gas , stellar and gaseous bulges , and stellar and gaseous galactic disks ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to study the mass and spin evolution in a self - consistent way , by taking into account the effect of the gas present in galactic nuclei both during the accretion phases and during mergers . also </S>",
    "<S> , we present predictions , as a function of redshift , for the fraction of gas - rich black - hole mergers  in which the spins prior to the merger are aligned due to the gravito - magnetic torques exerted by the circumbinary disk  as opposed to gas - poor mergers , in which the orientation of the spins before the merger is roughly isotropic . </S>",
