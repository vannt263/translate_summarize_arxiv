    "detached , double - lined spectroscopic binaries that are also eclipsing provide an accurate determination of stellar mass , radius and temperature for each of their individual components , and hence constitute a strong test of single star stellar evolution theory @xcite . eclipsing binary ( eb ) stars are very important for the study of stellar astrophysics .",
    "their particular geometrical layout , their dynamics and radiative physics enable a detailed and accurate modelling and analysis of the acquired data , and allow to measure many basic physical parameters of the components @xcite .",
    "studies of binary stars by all the techniques available in modern astrophysics allow to measure a wide range of parameters for each of the component stars , with some of them determined with very high accuracy ( e.g. , uncertainties of less than 1% ) .",
    "this also refers to the pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars . through a complete analysis of spectroscopy and photometry of these systems orbital and physical parameters of the two stars",
    "can be accurately derived . however , until recently there were only seven known low - mass pre - main sequence ebs with @xmath5 @xmath6 1.5 @xmath7 : rxj  0529.4 + 0041a @xcite , v1174  ori @xcite , 2mj0535 - 05 @xcite , jw380 @xcite , par  1802 @xcite , asas  j0528 + 03 @xcite , and  mml53 @xcite .",
    "mutiple systems of two or more bodies seem to be the norm at all stellar evolutionary stages , according to observations , and it has been accepted for some time now that binarity and multiplicity is established as the principal channel of star formation @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "knowledge of the formation of multiple stars becomes necessary to understand star formation in general @xcite .",
    "moreover , observations of young multiple systems allow to test evolutionary models in early stages of stellar evolution .    on the other hand , it is important to increase the sample of young stars ( especially pms ) because main - sequence , solar - type stars are well described by stellar evolution models ( observations agree well with theoretical isochrones ) , but recent measurements of the stellar properties of low - mass dwarfs and young pms stars remain problematic for the existing models @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the orbital and physical analysis of an eclipsing binary v1200  centauri ( hd  120778 , hip  67712 , asas  j135218 - 3837.3 ; @xmath8  =  13:52:17.51 , @xmath9 = -38:37:16.82 ) .",
    "it is a well detached system with a circular orbit , a short orbital period ( @xmath102.5 days ) , and observed parameters consistent with the pre - main - sequence evolutionary stage .",
    "we also announce the discovery that it is a triple hierarchical system .",
    "this system was first studied in 1954 in the cape photographic catalog 1950 @xcite , but only the magnitudes and epoch . then in 1984 the spectral type of f5v",
    "was defined @xcite .",
    "the system is described as an eclipsing algol ( ea ) by @xcite and has a @xmath11 magnitude of 8.551 @xcite . as a bright star ,",
    "it was a subject of spectroscopic studies of the geneva - copenhagen survey @xcite , where was treated as a single star , however due to large brightness ratio in the visual we can consider some of their results reliable .",
    "the parallax and proper motion are also known : @xmath12 = 8.43(94 )  mas , @xmath13 = -72.49(87 ) , @xmath14 = -44.20(78 )  mas  yr@xmath15 @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we describe the observations used to identify v1200  cen as an eclipsing and spectroscopic binary with a circumbinary companion , in section 3 we determine the orbital parameters of the system and physical properties of the component stars of and compare them with theoretical isochrones .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss the future observations needed to fully analyse the system .",
    "observations with pucheros instrument were carried out between january and may 2012 at the 50-cm telescope of the observatory uc santa martina located near santiago , chile .",
    "the telescope is the european southern observatory ( eso ) instrument , formerly located at la silla .",
    "pucheros is the pontificia universidad catlica high echelle resolution optical spectrograph developed at the center of astro - engeneering of pontificia universidad catlica de chile @xcite .",
    "the spectrograph is based on a classic echelle design , fed by the telescope through an optical fibre and it covers the visible range from 390 to 730 nm in one shot reaching a spectral resolution of 20,000 .",
    "it is located in a stable position , in a room adjacent to the telescope .",
    "the science image was typically created from four separate observations , 15 minutes each , combined later into one frame . for the wavelength calibration we used exposures of thar lamps taken before and after the science sequence .",
    "the data reduction of pucheros spectra was performed with the task echelle in the iraf package , following standard steps : ccd reduction , spectrum extraction and wavelength calibration .",
    "the data from pucheros were supplemented with spectra observed with the coralie spectrograph at the 1.2 m euler telescope .",
    "coralie is a fibre - fed cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph , it covers the spectral range from 380 to 690 nm reaching a spectral resolution of 50,000 .",
    "observations were made in a simultaneous wavelength calibration mode , where the light of the object is collected by one fibre , and of the thar lamp by the other .",
    "the spectra were taken between june 2012 and july 2013 .",
    "coralie data were reduced with a dedicated , python - based pipeline @xcite .",
    "photometric data were obtained from the all - sky automated survey ( asas ) @xcite and from the superwasp transiting planet survey @xcite .",
    "asas has produced an extensive catalogue of variable stars ( acvs ) of the southern hemisphere . in this work ,",
    "we use 495 data points from the third stage of the survey , obtained in the @xmath11 filter between 2000 and 2009 .",
    "superwasp is a wide - field photometric variability survey designed to detect transiting gas - giant planets around bright main sequence stars .",
    "the survey cameras observe bright stars ( v@xmath10 9 - 13 ) at high precision ( 1% ) using a broad @xmath16 band filter .",
    "3234 data points have been extracted from the superwasp public archive .",

    "+ @xmath18 from temperature ratio obtained with phoebe .",
    "one can see that the new higher values of radiative parameters fit the main sequence or even 20  myr models , and both radii still agree with the 30  myr isochrone .",
    "the age of 30  myr also happens to be the time scale of circularisation of the system s orbit .",
    "all in all , we get a self - consistent model of a 30 - 625  myr old , young multiple . as an attempt to distinguish between high and low temperature scale",
    "we also run a simplified spectral analysis with the spectroscopy made easy package ( sme ; * ? ? ?",
    "we took the coralie spectra , shifted by the measured velocity of the primary and stacked them together .",
    "we run the sme on a portion of spectrum spanning 6190 - 6260 , and keeping the [ @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 on values from or expected from tab .",
    "[ tab_phys ] .",
    "the secondary s contribution was treated as a contribution to the continuum , constant across the wavelength range .",
    "we obtained @xmath22  k , favouring the lower temperature scale , and younger ages ( fig .",
    "[ fig_iso ] ) .",
    "we are aware of the fact that such analysis is affected by the secondary , and we do not treat it as a proof for the correctness of holmberg s temperature , but we find it unlikely to be off by almost 1000  k , between spectral types f0 and f8 .",

    "we report the discovery that the eclipsing binary v1200  centauri is a triple , likely a member of the hyades moving group , but the largely inflated secondary s radius may suggest that the system may be pms around 30 myr .",
    "there are few such objects known so far , however they are very important for calibrating stellar evolution models at young ages , where stars are changing rapidly as they evolve onto the main sequence .",
    "analysis of asas and superwasp light curves combined with radial velocity measurements allowed to obtain absolute parameters of the system . through our analysis of radial velocities and orbital solution",
    "we determined the presence of a third companion , in a wide orbit .",
    "we reached a good precision in mass determination ( 2.2 and 1.7% ) , but other parameters ( radii , temperatures , luminosities ) are not that well established .",
    "further analysis of the system allowed us to compare our results with stellar evolution models , obtaining an approximate age of 30 myr . despite its brightness",
    ", data of higher s / n are required to better constrain physical parameters of the system , especially temperatures and ratio of the radii .",
    "possible solution would be to obtain photometry and spectroscopy in the ir , where components b and c contribute more than in visual",
    ". the secondary eclipse would be deeper , and the influence of the third light should be detectable . also , if rvs of the star c were measured , a full dynamical solution of the system could be obtained , including mass of the third star and the inclination of its orbit .",
    "this would also allow for comparing the isochrones with three stars , thus constrain the age and evolutionary status even better .",
    "with its probable age , v1200  cen is an important object to study the tidal and third - body interactions young binaries .",
