    "further analyses confirmed that nir luminosities without light - curve shape corrections are more effective distance indicators than corrected optical luminosities @xcite . a key ingredient to realize the full potential of nir sn  ia cosmology is nir spectroscopy , such that the peak luminosities can be accurately k - corrected to the rest frame .",
    "with the limited scope and size of the world s current nir spectroscopic sample , the time evolution and the diversity of the spectral features are to date poorly understood .",
    "these uncertainties directly affect the determination of the nir rest - frame peak luminosities .    given that sne  ia play a critical role in observational cosmology , it is as critical as ever to understand the explosion mechanisms and the progenitor systems .",

    "the electron scattering opacity is low enough that the iron - peak feature is fully exposed .",

    "the predictability of the strength and the evolution of the iron - peak feature means that we can indeed improve upon the current method of nir k - correction @xcite , by building , for example , spectral templates as a function of @xmath5 .",

    ", we explore the effect of assuming the spectral template for the case of a sn  2011fe - like object at various redshifts .",
    "before the k - corrections were calculated , the spectral template at each phase was warped to the nir colors provided by wfcam and whirc  photometry of sn  2011fe ( i m et al . in prep ; * ? ? ?",

    ".    the mismatch of the  feature near 1.05 @xmath4 m  is evident in the first three spectra .",
    "the discrepancy is not surprising , since these are the earliest nir spectra published to date .",
    "there also appears to be some mismatch in the strength of the prominent @xmath42-band feature at later phases .",
    "this illustrates the limitation of using a single template for all sne  ia .",
    "as shown in section  [ s : iron ] , the strength of this iron - peak feature correlates with @xmath5 .",
    "armed with this well - defined correlation , one can build a sequence of templates as a function of @xmath5  to minimize the k - correction uncertainty associated with this feature .",
    "the mismatches between the spectra and template are reflected in the k - correction differences plotted in figure  [ f : kcorr_diff ] .",
    "the k - correction differences were calculated at two redshifts , 0.03 and 0.08 , which coincide with the redshift limits of current surveys of nearby sne  ia in the hubble flow .",
    "the larger differences observed at early phases in the @xmath52 band and at late phases in the @xmath42 band originate from the mismatches in the  feature at early phases and the iron - peak feature at late phases . at @xmath53 where the rest and observed filters are significantly misaligned , the mean absolute sizes of the differences over the phase range are 0.04 , 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.06 mag in @xmath52 , @xmath54 , @xmath42 , @xmath55 , respectively , similar to the numbers reported by @xcite for the optical filters .",
    "the offsets in the peak magnitude caused by assuming the spectral template can be approximated by using the average of the k - correction differences weighted by the light - curve template errors . for a sn",
    "2011fe - like object , the impact of assuming a template sed on the determination of peak magnitude is small , on the level of 0.01 mag for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath53 ( figure  [ f : kcorr_diff ] ) .    nonetheless , whether the differences at various phases correlate with each other offers us important clues as to how to proceed to minimize the impact of uncertainties in k - corrections .",
    "if the k - correction differences from various phases are completely uncorrelated , more observations on the light curve could drive down the uncertainty in the peak magnitude determination . if the differences are significantly correlated , there is room for improvement in the time evolution of the spectral templates .",
    "the first attempt to quantify these correlations in the optical was made by @xcite .",
    "this study requires a large sample of time - series spectra , which does not yet exist in the nir . in section  [ s : conc ] , we describe the ongoing efforts to build such a data set .",
    "the availability of color constraints from neighboring filters is also crucial for obtaining good k - correction estimates .",
    "for example , an accurate k - correction to the @xmath54 band requires @xmath58 and @xmath59 colors to warp the spectral template to the correct observed colors around the wavelength region in question .",
    "missing color information inflates the k - correction uncertainty to @xmath60 mag @xcite .",
    "the higher k - correction difference seen in the @xmath55 band in figure  [ f : kcorr_diff ] is most likely due to the lack of constraining observation in a redder band .",
    "we have presented ten medium - resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio nir spectra of sn  2011fe .",
    "this data set constitutes the earliest time - series nir spectroscopy of a sn ia , with the first spectrum obtained at only 2.58 days past the explosion .",

    "the  velocity of sn  2011fe , measured from the absorption minimum of the  @xmath31.0927 @xmath4 m  line profile , decreases rapidly at very early phases , then flattens to a remarkably constant evolution from 10 days before to 10 days past @xmath2-band maximum , with a dispersion of only 130 kms@xmath19 .",
    "3 .   taking advantage of the constant velocity over a wide time window , the  @xmath31.0927 @xmath4 m  line , even without time - series observations , can be used to locate the inner edge of carbon burning .",

    "as a proxy for the temperature of the line - blanketing material , the strong correlation between the peak flux ratio and @xmath5  indicates a close tie between temperature of the iron - peak elements and the production of @xmath15ni .",

    ", the predictability of its strength and the evolution means that nir k - corrections can be improved by producing spectral templates as a function of @xmath5 .",

    "principal component analysis ( pca ) is a statistical technique useful for reducing the dimensionality and identifying patterns in a set of multi - dimensional data .",
    "we use the `` bra ket '' notation of @xcite here for the formulation of pca . a sample of early , high signal - to - noise ratio nir spectra from the literature , including those of sn  2011fe , were used as pca data input to build the model of the  @xmath31.0927 @xmath4 m  profile .",
    "each spectrum was shifted in wavelength , such that the  line minima coincide at a fiducial wavelength of 1.05 @xmath4 m , normalized to the same integrated flux in the @xmath52 band , and interpolated into @xmath62 fixed wavelength elements .",
    "the wavelength interval was chosen to be 10 , approximately matching and preserving the medium resolution of the sn  2011fe spectra at 1.05 @xmath4 m .",
    "the log of the flux was used as the pca input data and is denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "the mean spectrum @xmath64 was computed and subtracted from the data set .",
    "a @xmath65 covariance matrix was then computed to determine the strength of the correlation between spectral features .",
    "the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix were computed using internal idl routines which utilize householder reductions and the ql method @xcite .",
    "each of the @xmath62 eigenvectors , or principal components , denoted here by @xmath66 , was ranked by the corresponding eigenvalue , which provides a measure of the amount of data variation the principal component describes .",
    "the zeroth - ranked principal component points in the direction of maximum variance in the @xmath62-dimensional data space , and subsequent principal components are orthogonal vectors : @xmath67 each of our input spectra can be expressed as the sum of the eigenvectors : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the projection of the @xmath70th input spectrum on the @xmath71th eigenvector .    using these eigenvectors ,",
    "the model spectrum of the  feature was then built as @xmath23 , which varies as a function of the number of eigenvectors @xmath72 , and projection @xmath73 for each eigenvector @xmath74 : @xmath75"

    "<S> the  velocity during this constant phase locates the inner edge of carbon burning and probes the conditions under which the transition from deflagration to detonation occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the  velocity does not correlate with the optical light - curve decline rate @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the prominent break at @xmath6 @xmath4 m  is the main source of concern for nir k - correction calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate here that the feature has a uniform time evolution among sne  ia , with the flux ratio across the break strongly correlated with @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the predictability of the strength and the onset of this feature suggests that the associated k - correction uncertainties can be minimized with improved spectral templates .    </S>",
