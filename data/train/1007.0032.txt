    "the nuclear shell model  @xcite was developed in part to explain the observed extra stability of nuclei along the valley of @xmath0 stability corresponding to ` magic ' numbers of protons and/or neutrons .",
    "the magic numbers at 2 , 8 , 20 , etc . were explained as corresponding to closed - shell nucleonic configurations . while the shell model is robust near stability , there is evidence at the extremes of the nuclear chart that the single - particle level ordering changes , leading to the erosion of some shell closures and/or the appearance of new ` magic ' numbers in exotic nuclei .",
    "the attractive proton - neutron monopole interaction  @xcite can produce drastic changes in level ordering , and in regions of low single - particle density , result in modified shell gaps .",
    "for example , the monopole shift of the @xmath8@xmath9 orbit with changing @xmath10@xmath6 occupancy has been invoked to explain the observed @xmath3=32 subshell closure in nuclei in the neighborhood of the doubly - magic nucleus @xmath11ca .",
    "the @xmath3=32 subshell closure has been well - established experimentally in @xmath7ca  @xcite , @xmath12ti  @xcite and @xmath13cr  @xcite on the basis of the systematic behavior of the @xmath14 energies as a function of neutron number in the even - even nuclei of these isotopic chains .",
    "additional evidence for @xmath3=32 as a new subshell closure in neutron - rich nuclei below @xmath15=28 comes from the low @xmath16 transition probabilities measured for @xmath17ti  @xcite and @xmath18cr  @xcite .",
    "the high - spin structures of @xmath19ti  @xcite are also indicative of a sizeable @xmath3=32 shell gap .",
    "the separation between the 6@xmath20 and the closely spaced 8@xmath20 , 9@xmath20 and 10@xmath20 levels in @xmath17ti was taken to indicate the substantial energy cost in promoting a @xmath21 neutron to either of the @xmath8@xmath22 or @xmath8@xmath9 orbitals .",
    "migration of the @xmath8@xmath9 orbit may be such that , beyond @xmath3=32 , a gap between the @xmath8@xmath22 and the @xmath8@xmath9 orbitals develops .",
    "the results of shell - model calculations with the gxpf1 effective interaction point to a @xmath3=34 subshell closure in the neutron - rich ti and ca isotopes  @xcite .",
    "the prediction of a new magic number at @xmath3=34 for the ti isotopes is inconsistent with experimental results in @xmath18ti  @xcite .",
    "however , shell - model calculations with the slightly - modified gxpf1a effective interaction  @xcite suggest that a @xmath3=34 subshell gap may still be present in the ca isotopes .    while the level structure of @xmath17ca remains difficult to reach experimentally , the possible development of a @xmath3=34 shell closure in this region can be examined indirectly . some insight into the relative collectivity of the @xmath7ca isotopes",
    "can be obtained from the energy separation between the @xmath23@xmath24 ground states and @xmath23@xmath25 excited states in the odd - mass @xmath26v isotopes .",
    "these cluster states were described in detail by paar  @xcite , and shown to depend on the interaction between the proton cluster and underlying core . in the cases of @xmath27v@xmath28  @xcite and @xmath29v@xmath30  @xcite , with three protons beyond doubly - magic @xmath31ca@xmath28 and @xmath32ca@xmath30 respectively , the separations between the ground state and 5/2@xmath33 cluster states are 320 and 323 kev . however , for @xmath34v@xmath35  @xcite and @xmath36v@xmath37  @xcite , with three protons beyond @xmath38ca@xmath35 and @xmath17ca@xmath37 respectively , the separations are only 128 and 113 kev , suggesting that the @xmath17ca core is more like that of @xmath38ca than magic @xmath31ca or @xmath32ca .    the possible @xmath3=34 subshell closure has also been probed by tracking the monopole migration of the @xmath8@xmath9 orbital in neighboring nuclei .",
    "previous work by liddick @xmath39  @xcite , following the systematic evolution of the @xmath8@xmath9 level through consideration of the ground - state spin and parity assignments of odd - odd v and sc isotopes , indicated an inversion of the @xmath8@xmath9 and @xmath8@xmath22 single - particle orbitals in moving from the @xmath26v to the @xmath5sc isotopes .",
    "the apparent close spacing of the @xmath8@xmath9 and @xmath8@xmath22 orbits in the @xmath12ti isotopes , leading to the absence of the @xmath3=34 subshell closure for @xmath15=22 , also supports the observed evolution of the neutron single - particle states .",
    "energy spacings between high - spin states in @xmath17ti and the first three yrast states in @xmath18ti  @xcite both suggest that the @xmath8@xmath9 and @xmath8@xmath22 orbitals are nearly degenerate .    here , we report on the low - energy structures of @xmath2sc populated following the @xmath0 decay of @xmath2ca respectively , as well as on the low - energy levels of @xmath40sc populated by isomeric @xmath41-ray decay .",
    "the low - energy levels of the @xmath5sc isotopes can provide insight into the structure of even - even ca isotopes , as these sc levels result from the coupling of the odd proton to states in the ca core .",
    "additionally , we report on newly observed states in @xmath1ti populated in the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1sc , respectively . the nuclei studied in the present work",

    "however , the apparent compression of the low - energy structure of the neutron - rich sc isotopes suggests that there may not be a significant @xmath3=34 gap between the @xmath8@xmath22 and @xmath8@xmath9 single - particle states in the @xmath5sc isotopic chain .",
    "the @xmath0 decay and isomeric properties of the neutron - rich @xmath2ca and @xmath1sc parent nuclides were deduced in experiments carried out using the experimental facilities at national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nscl ) at michigan state university .",
    "a low - energy beam of @xmath42ge@xmath43 was accelerated to 11.6  mev / nucleon in the k500 cyclotron , and , following foil stripping to produce @xmath42ge@xmath44 , accelerated to the full energy of 130  mev / nucleon in the k1200 cyclotron .",
    "the @xmath42ge beam was fragmented in a 352-mg/@xmath45 thick be target located at the object position of the a1900 fragment separator  @xcite .",
    "the secondary fragments of interest were selected in the a1900 using a 45-mg/@xmath45 al wedge and 5% momentum slits located at the intermediate dispersive image of the separator .",
    "fully - stripped secondary fragments were sent to the nscl beta counting system ( bcs)@xcite located in the s2 experimental vault .",
    "the central implantation detector of the bcs was a 995-@xmath46 m thick double - sided si microstrip detector ( dssd ) .",
    "the dssd was segmented into 40 1-mm wide strips in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions , for a total of 1600 pixels .",
    "three si pin detectors , with respective thicknesses of 297  @xmath46 m , 297  @xmath46 m and 488  @xmath46 m , were located upstream of the dssd .",
    "six single - sided si strip detectors ( sssds ) were placed downstream of the dssd .",
    "the last two sssds provided a veto for light particles that arrived at the counting system with the secondary beam .",
    "the range of the fragments was adjusted with a 4-mm al degrader located immediately upstream of the bcs detectors , to implant the ions near the center of the dssd .",
    "implanted fragments were unambiguously identified by a combination of multiple energy loss signals , time - of - flight , and the fragment separator magnetic rigidity ( @xmath47@xmath48 ) setting .",
    "the fragment energy loss was measured in the three pin detectors , and fragment time - of - flight was determined as the time difference between a particle impinging on a plastic scintillator detector positioned at the dispersive image of the a1900 separator , and the first si pin detector ( pin1 ) .",

    "the average implantation rate over the entire face of the dssd was @xmath50 100  hz .    fragment-@xmath0 correlations were established in software by requiring a high - energy implantation event in a single pixel ( @xmath51,@xmath52 ) of the dssd , where @xmath51 is a horizontal strip and @xmath52 is a vertical one .",

    "the differences between the absolute time stamps of correlated @xmath0 and implantation events were histogrammed to generate decay curves .",
    "the profile of implantations over the dssd surface was such that pixels near the center of the detector experienced a significantly higher implantation rate than those at the detector edge .",
    "the higher implantation rate led to a larger accumulated activity in the central pixels . to avoid random correlations when",
    "using longer correlation times , a subset of pixels on the dssd was defined for which the time between implantations was @xmath53100  s. corresponding to pixels on the edge of the detector , this subset of pixels included 50% of the detector surface , and was used for the analysis of decays with long correlation times .",

    "prompt and delayed @xmath41-ray detection was accomplished using sixteen detectors from the segmented germanium array ( sega )  @xcite .",
    "the ge detectors were oriented in two concentric rings of 8 detectors each , surrounding the beam pipe containing the bcs detectors .",

    "given such an ordering , @xmath29ti@xmath74 is expected to have a 1/2@xmath33 ground state , as the first neutron above the @xmath3=32 subshell closure should occupy the @xmath22 orbital .",
    "the first excited state in @xmath29ti then corresponds to excitation of the valence neutron into the @xmath9 orbital .",
    "the recent direct determination of the ground state spin and parity in @xmath29ti  @xcite provides confirmation for the ordering of the @xmath8@xmath22 and @xmath8@xmath9 orbitals , with the @xmath8@xmath22 orbital lying lower in energy , similar to the ordering in the @xmath5sc isotopes .",
    "thus , it appears that the @xmath8@xmath22-@xmath8@xmath9 level ordering changes already in going from @xmath26v to @xmath12ti , though a significant energy gap between these orbitals is not present in the ti isotopes  @xcite .",
    "based on the assumed neutron - level ordering , @xmath36ti@xmath75 is expected to have a 5/2@xmath33 ground state , with a neutron configuration of @xmath76 , and a first excited state with @xmath58=1/2@xmath33 , corresponding to excitation of a @xmath22 neutron into the @xmath9 orbital .",
    "thus , this is essentially an inversion of the two lowest states in @xmath29ti .",
    "calculations with the gxpf1a interaction have placed this first excited state at an energy of 422  kev  @xcite . in the present results",
    ", one state has been placed in the level scheme of @xmath36ti at an energy of 364  kev , which may correspond to the 1/2@xmath33 first excited state .",
    "if this is the case , @xmath0 decay from the @xmath36sc 7/2@xmath33 ground state should not directly populate this state , and it must be fed indirectly from higher - lying states .",

    "allowed @xmath0 decay from @xmath36sc , with a 7/2@xmath33 ground state , populating the first - excited state in @xmath36ti would suggest a reversal of the level ordering shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ti_systematic ] , and would present a significant challenge for theory .",
    "however , before the origin of the 364-kev state can be confirmed , a more complete picture of the low - energy states in @xmath36ti is required .",
    "the low - energy levels of neutron - rich @xmath4sc and @xmath1ti have been investigated through the @xmath0 decay of the parent nuclides @xmath2ca and @xmath1sc , as well as through prompt isomeric @xmath41-ray emission from @xmath40sc .",
    "the low - energy structures of the sc isotopes can be considered in the extreme single - particle model as the result of coupling of the valence @xmath6 proton to states in the corresponding @xmath7ca core .",
    "such a description works well in @xmath34sc , where the valence proton weakly couples to states in doubly - magic @xmath77ca@xmath30 .",
    "the success of this description provides further evidence for the validity of the @xmath3=32 subshell closure in the ca isotopes .",
    "interpretation of the low - energy levels in the even - a sc isotopes as resulting from the simple coupling of a @xmath6 proton and valence neutrons to a ca core provides preliminary information regarding the energy separation between neutron single - particle levels .",
    "while more work is required to complete the relevant multiplets of states , early indications suggest that the low - energy levels in the sc isotopes are compressed , and that a significant @xmath3=34 subshell gap does not exist between the @xmath22 and @xmath9 neutron levels in the @xmath5sc isotopes .",
