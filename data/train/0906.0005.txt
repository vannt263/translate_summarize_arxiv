    "in a recent paper  @xcite we presented methods for obtaining coordinate expansions for the ( tail part of the ) retarded green function in spherically symmetric spacetimes . by using computer algebra to obtain high order taylor series ( of order @xmath5 ) , and applying the theory of pad approximants we were able to obtain accurate expressions in remarkably large regions . using these expressions , we were able to present the first complete matched expansion calculation of the self - force in a model ` black hole ' spacetime , the nariai spacetime  @xcite , and are currently applying the method to schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "our ultimate goal in this programme is to work in more general spacetimes , especially kerr spacetime .",
    "a key component of the matched expansion approach is knowledge of the green function for points close together ( i.e. in a _ quasilocal _",
    "region ) . as we move away from specific symmetry conditions , we can no longer rely on methods based on a special choice of coordinates in the construction of our quasilocal solution and are led instead to consider other techniques such as transport equations and covariant expansion methods .",
    "covariant methods for calculating the green function of the wave operator and the corresponding heat kernel , briefly reviewed in sec .  [ sec : review ] below , are central to a broad range of problems from radiation reaction to quantum field theory in curved spacetime and quantum gravity .",
    "there is an extremely extensive literature on this topic ; here we provide only a very brief overview referring the reader to the reviews by vassilevich  @xcite and poisson  @xcite and references therein for a more complete discussion .",
    "these methods have evolved from pioneering work by hadamard  @xcite on the classical theory and dewitt  @xcite on the quantum theory .",
    "the central objects in the hadamard and dewitt covariant expansions are geometrical bi - tensor coefficients @xmath6 which are commonly called dewitt or hamidew coefficients in the physics literature .",
    "these coefficients are closely related to the short proper - time asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel of an elliptic operator in a riemannian space and so are commonly called heat kernel coefficients in the mathematics literature . traditionally most attention has focused on the _ diagonal value _ of the heat kernel @xmath7 , since the coincidence limits @xmath8 play a central role in the classical theory of spectral invariants  @xcite and in the quantum theory of the effective action and trace anomalies  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , for the quasilocal part of the matched expansion approach to radiation reaction @xcite we seek expansions valid for @xmath9 and @xmath10 as far apart as geometrical methods permit .",
    "the classical approach to the calculation of these coefficients in the physics literature was to use a recursive approach developed by dewitt @xcite in the 1960s .",
    "although these recursive methods work well for the first few terms in the expansion @xcite , and may be implemented in a tensor software package @xcite , the amount of calculation required to compute subsequent terms quickly becomes prohibitively long , even when implemented as a computer program .",
    "an alternative approach , more common in the mathematics literature , is to use pseudo - differential operators and invariance theory  @xcite , where a basis of curvature invariants of the appropriate structure is constructed  @xcite and then their coefficients determined by explicit evaluation in simple spacetimes .",
    "however , here too , the size of the basis grows rapidly and there seems little prospect of reaching orders comparable to those we obtained in the highly symmetric configurations previously studied .",
    "an extremely elegant , non - recursive approach to the calculation of hamidew coefficients has been given by avramidi  @xcite , but as his motivation was to study the effective action in quantum gravity he was primarily interested in the coincidence limit of the hamidew coefficients , while in the self - force problem , as noted above , we require point - separated expressions .",
    "in addition , avramidi introduced his method in the language of quantum mechanics ; quite distinct from the language of transport equations , such as the raychaudhuri equation , more familiar to discussions of geodesics among relativists . in this paper",
    "we present avramidi s approach in the language of transport equations and show that it is ideal for numerical and symbolic computation . in so doing we are building on the work of dcanini and folacci  @xcite who wrote many of the equations we present ( we indicate below where we deviate from their approach ) and",
    "implemented them explicitly by hand .",
    "however , calculations by hand are long and inevitably prone to error , particularly for higher spin and for higher order terms in the series and are quite impractical for the very high order expansions we would like for radiation reaction calculations .",
    "instead , we use the transport equations as the basis for _ mathematica _ code for algebraic calculations and _ c _ code for numerical calculations . rather than presenting our results in excessively long equations (",
    "our non - canonical expression for @xmath11 for a scalar field contains @xmath12 terms ! )",
    ", we have provided these codes online @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] , we provide a brief review of green functions , bi - tensors and covariant expansions , outlining the relations between the classical and quantum theories .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : avramidi ] , we detail the principles that we consider to encapsulate the key insights of the avramidi approach and use these to write down a set of transport equations for the key bi - tensors of the theory .",
    "these provide an adaptation of the avramidi approach which is ideally suited to implementation on a computer either numerically or symbolically .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : symbolic ] , we describe a semi - recursive approach to solving for covariant expansion and briefly describe our _ mathematica _ implementation of it and its interface to the tensor software package _",

    "[ sec : numerical ] , we present a numerical implementation of the the transport equation approach to the calculation of @xmath2 along a null geodesic .    given our motivation in studying the radiation reaction problem we shall phrase all the discussion of this paper in 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the reader is referred to decanini and folacci  @xcite for a discussion of the corresponding situation in spacetimes of more general ( integer ) dimension .",
    "we do note however that the hamidew coefficients are purely geometric bi - tensors , formally independent of the spacetime dimension .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use units in which @xmath13 and adopt the sign conventions of @xcite .",
    "we denote symmetrization of indices using brackets ( e.g. @xmath14 ) and exclude indices from symmetrization by surrounding them by vertical bars ( e.g. @xmath15 ) .",
    "roman letters are used for free indices and greek letters for indices summed over all spacetime dimensions .",
    "we take an arbitrary field @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the spinorial / tensorial index appropriate to the field , and consider wave operators which are second order partial differential operators of the form  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the covariant derivative defined by a connection @xmath21 : @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the mass of the field and @xmath24 is a possible potential term .    in the classical theory of wave propagation in curved spacetime ,",

    "( [ eq : hadamard ] ) represents the _ direct _ part of the green function while the second term , involving @xmath38 , is known as the _ tail _ part of the green function .",
    "this tail term represents back - scattering off the spacetime geometry and is , for example , responsible for the quasilocal contribution to the self - force .    within the hadamard approach",
    ", the symmetric bi - scalar @xmath34 is expressed in terms of a formal expansion in increasing powers of @xmath39 @xcite : @xmath40 the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 are determined by imposing the wave equation , using the identity @xmath43 , and setting the coefficient of each _ manifest _ power of @xmath44 equal to zero . since @xmath45 is symmetric for self - adjoint wave operators we are free to apply the wave equation either at @xmath9 or at @xmath10 ; here we choose to apply it at @xmath10 .",
    "we find that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the van vleck - morette determinant defined as  @xcite @xmath48 ^{-1/2 } \\det \\left ( -\\sigma _ { ; \\alpha \\beta ' } { \\left ( x , x ' \\right)}\\right ) \\left [ -g \\left ( x ' \\right ) \\right ] ^{-1/2 }    = \\det \\left ( -g^{\\alpha'}{}_\\alpha { \\left ( x , x ' \\right)}\\sigma ^{;\\alpha } { } _ { \\nu ' } { \\left ( x , x ' \\right)}\\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath49 being the bi - vector of parallel transport ( defined fully below ) . in making this identification",
    "we have used the transport equation for the van vleck - morette determinant : @xmath50 the coefficients @xmath51 satisfy the recursion relations    [ eq : recursionv ] @xmath52 for @xmath53 along with the ` initial condition ' @xmath54    these are transport equations which may be solved in principle within a causal domain by direct integration along the geodesic from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the complication is that the calculation of @xmath55 requires the calculation of second derivatives of @xmath56 off the geodesic ; we address this issue below .",
    "finally we note that the hadamard expansion is an ansatz not a taylor series .",
    "for example , in desitter spacetime for a conformally invariant scalar theory all the @xmath57 s are non - zero while @xmath58 .      in curved spacetime a fundamental object of interest",

    "the integrand @xmath69 clearly satisfies the schrdinger / heat equation @xmath70 together with the initial condition @xmath71 . the trivial way in which the mass @xmath23 enters these equations allows it to be eliminated through the prescription @xmath72 with the massless heat kernel satisfying the equation @xmath73 together with the ` initial condition ' @xmath74 .    in @xmath75-dimensional minkowski spacetime without potential , the massless heat kernel is readily obtained as @xmath76 this motivates the ansatz  @xcite that in general the massless heat kernel allows the representation @xmath77 where @xmath78 possesses the following asymptotic expansion as @xmath79 : @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 has dimension @xmath83 . the inclusion of the explicit factor of @xmath84 is simply a matter of convention ; by including it we are following dewitt , but many authors , including dcanini and folacci , choose instead to include it in the series coefficients @xmath85 it is clearly trivial to convert between the two conventions and , in any case , the coincidence limits agree .",

    "although this method proves effective for determining the lowest few order terms by hand and can be readily implemented in software , it does not scale well and it is not long before the computation time required to calculate the next term is prohibitively large .",
