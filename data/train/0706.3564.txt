    "the peeling dynamics of adhesive tapes and especially its stick - slip complex regime has been the center of extensive investigations in recent years .",
    "the interest in such a phenomenon has two main justifications . industrial processing often requires to peel ribbon of different kinds at very high velocities .",
    "in this situation , the stick - slip phenomenon and its jerky dynamics can cause important problems including delays on the assembly line .",
    "additionally , understanding the physics of the adhesive tape peeling is precious for modeling and testing the resistance of elastomer - substrate joints , and this seemingly simple system allows to gain deeper insights into more subtle aspects of the physics of adhesion @xcite . despite extensive experimental and modeling efforts , our understanding of the jerky behavior experienced in the so - called stick - slip regime",
    "is still limited .",
    "the phenomenon remains highly non - linear and the dynamics shows a variety of instabilities and structures @xcite .",
    "several dynamical models were developed with an increasing degree of realism , leading to an increasing complex dynamics @xcite .",
    "each model is characterized by a series of seemingly trivial assumptions which progressively revealed to have a crucial effect on the dynamical aspects of the problem .    due to the very rapid nature of the stick - slip dynamics ,",
    "the main physical quantity generally accessed to in the experiments is the distribution of the time intervals between successive events that can be identified through the measurement of the related acoustic or photonic emissions @xcite . in such experiments ,",
    "an increasing irregularity of the stick - slip dynamics has been observed for an increasing peeling velocity .",
    "this behavior reveals to be more rich and complicated than a simple bifurcation route to chaos",
    ". in particular , one can observe hierarchical structures in a definite traction velocity range that can suggest the emergence of complexity .",
    "even though a lot of experimental studies of adhesive tape peeling has been performed , the direct observation of the local motion of the peeling point in the stick - slip regime has not been done for the moment . in this paper",
    ", we present an experimental procedure for imaging directly , using a high speed camera , the dynamics at the peeling point , especially during the stick - slip phase ( cf .",
    "link : video / video1.avi[video 1 ] ) .",
    "we test this technique in experiments where a constant load is applied to the tape .",
    "these very first experiments showing the true stick - slip dynamics of the peeling point in an adhesive tape already give very precise informations that will help to screen among the various assumptions usually done in theoretical models .",
    "the technique opens the way for many more experimental investigations that should clarify the physics at stake in the peeling of an adhesive tape .",
    "the experiments on the peeling of an adhesive tape are generally performed using two different setups . in the first one ,",
    "the peeling is studied when a constant traction velocity @xmath1 is imposed onto the free end of the tape by the action of an electric motor . in this case , with a fixed geometry , @xmath1 is the only dynamical control parameter . in a second type of experiment the peeling",
    "is studied when a constant applied load is clamped to the tape free end and the control parameter is the imposed force @xmath2 . in these experiments ,",
    "the limit between the adhesive tape ribbon and the free tape may be seen as a crack tip propagating at a speed @xmath3 .",

    "these variables refer to the local dynamics of the peeling point and correspond to the tensile force @xmath2 and velocity @xmath1 at the free end of the tape only when the peeling is regular and the peeling angle @xmath11 .",
    "the sigmoidal shape is responsible for the hysteretic behavior and therefore for the stick - slip dynamics.,width=340 ]    it is widely admitted in the literature @xcite that there is a fundamental relation between the local peeling force @xmath10 and the peeling velocity @xmath3 at the peeling point ( @xmath10 is equal to the tensile force @xmath2 at the free tape end in an idealized case where the peeling angle is @xmath11 and the peeling is regular ) .",
    "a schematic representation of such relation is plotted in figure [ schemafv ] . the sigmoidal shape of this curve , that is a consequence of the adhesive material rheology , presents three remarkable regions : two stable ones ( i and iii ) and an unstable one ( ii ) .",
    "a full theoretical understanding of the shape of this curve is not available for the moment , but it has been known , at least since prandtl @xcite , that such a dependence will lead to a hysteretic behavior of the peeling point dynamics .",
    "a similar hysteresis of the force - velocity response is proposed to explain the pinning and depinning dynamics of charge - density waves , vortex arrays in semi - conductors @xcite and possibly the stick - slip behavior of contact lines @xcite or magnetic domain walls @xcite .",
    "barquins and maugis @xcite performed a series of experiments at constant traction velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the observed dynamics exhibits the following behavior : at slow traction velocity , the tape is peeled regularly and the dynamics is stationary ( branch i ) ; at high traction velocity , the dynamics is also regular , but much more rapid ( branch iii ) ; in the intermediate range of @xmath1 , a stick - slip phenomenon appears , the peeling of the tape being jerky with emission of a characteristic noise . in this regime , for increasing values of the traction velocity ( from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) , the stick - slip motion is at first rather periodic , then it becomes more and more irregular .",
    "it has been argued that the irregular motion corresponds to chaotic orbits @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the local dynamics at the peeling point is expected to follow a complex trajectory , still not experimentally resolved , around the hysteretic region of the @xmath12 curve .",
    "in contrast , when a constant force @xmath10 is applied to the peeling point , a stable regime always exists for the peeling ( cf .",

    ", several different regimes were observed for a given load depending on the way the experiment is started .",
    "the simplest experiment consists in applying the load instantaneously for an initial zero velocity of the peeling . in this case , where the initial condition of the peeling is out of equilibrium , the system reaches , for loads under @xmath8 , a stable and regular peeling regime corresponding to branch i ( branch a in figure [ grafvp ] ) . forcing the peeling with a large enough initial velocity ,",
    "it is as well possible to observe the stable and regular regime corresponding to branch iii ( branch c in figure [ grafvp ] ) for loads over @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , an unexpected stick - slip regime was observed between the two stable branches ( ab ) and ( dc ) , for loads between @xmath9 and @xmath8 , when introducing a moderate initial velocity to the peeling .",
    "the existence of this regime shows the metastability of the ( ab ) and ( dc ) branches and was attributed to the inertia of the falling load that can not maintain instantaneously a constant force at the peeling point . in this regime ,",
    "the local force and velocity at the peeling point are following cycles in the ( abcd ) region of figure [ schemafv ] .",
    "experimentally , it was observed that the time averaged value @xmath13 of the peeling velocity in this stick - slip regime reaches a constant value that is almost unsensitive to the load over one order of magnitude ( cf .",
    "figure [ grafvp ] ) . finally , for loads over the critical load @xmath8 ( and typically less than @xmath14 ) and an initial zero velocity of the peeling , a stick - slip regime arising spontaneously can be observed .",

    "however , it is important to take into account the acceleration @xmath76 of the load which reduces the tensile force on the peeling point : @xmath77 . since the length of the peeled tape",
