    "the problem of determining the causal relationship between various interacting fields or variables is of fundamental importance in many branches of science .",
    "knowledge of the causal connection between variables is helpful for the elaboration of a realistic physical model and/or to check its validity .",
    "if one can intervene in the system under study and modulate the value of one variable , the observation of the ( delayed ) reaction of other variables to this modulation sometimes allows establishing the causal relationship . however , for various reasons many systems do not permit such intervention , or they are too complex to allow a straightforward interpretation of the observations . other techniques to uncover causal relations are based on finding precursor events , time delays between extreme events ( conditional averaging ) , correlations , etc .",
    "one may also attempt to match the system evolution to the predicted evolution from an analytic or numerical model , or to quantify parameters related to system evolution ( growth rates , damping rates , etc . ) .",
    "most of these methods , however , do not provide a direct quantification of the causal interaction between variables .",
    "even worse , linear analysis techniques ( correlations , conditional averages ) may lead to confusing or even erroneous conclusions regarding causality ( cf .  the well - known adage _ ` correlation does not imply causation ' _ ) .",
    "in this situation , how must one then determine the causal relation between variables ?",
    "causality is notoriously hard to define in general  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we do not use the term ` causality ' in its philosophical , absolute sense ( if @xmath0 occurs , then @xmath1 will occur ; or : if @xmath1 occurs , then @xmath0 must have occurred ) . rather , we turn to the concept of ` quantifiable causality ' introduced by wiener  @xcite ( rephrased slightly ) : _ for two simultaneously measured signals @xmath1 and @xmath0 , if we can predict @xmath1 better by using the past information from @xmath0 than without it , then we call @xmath0 causal to @xmath1 .",
    "_ this idea led to the formulation of an algorithm for the detection of the causal relation between two measured signals , denoted by _ granger causality _",
    "this algorithm , however , is based on a linear prediction of the evolution of a time series involving multivariate minimization , which is inadequate for the analysis of turbulence . although non - linear generalizations are possible and have indeed been elaborated  @xcite , here we turn to a non - parametric procedure for causality detection originating in the field of information theory : the ` transfer entropy '  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we are mainly concerned with the interaction between zonal flows and turbulence .",
    "this interaction underlies the spontaneous confinement transitions often observed in fusion plasmas , fundamental for the design of an economically attractive fusion reactor . in recent years",
    ", more or less detailed models for this interaction have become available  @xcite .",
    "much effort has been invested in demonstrating the relevance of these models for describing the observations , applying advanced analysis tools such as the bicoherence  @xcite    an important aspect of these studies is the elucidation of the causal relation between turbulence , fluctuating zonal flows , and steady state sheared flows .",
    "this issue is often implicitly present in the relevant publications , although causality is usually treated with some respect due to the difficulty of addressing it directly ; usually , all that can be said is that a certain sequence of events is observed ( @xmath0 happens before @xmath1 ) , which is a necessary but insufficient condition for the existence of a causal relation",
    ". some ` traditional ' methods for elucidating the causal relation between zonal flows and turbulence in fusion plasmas are  @xcite : ( a ) looking for spatial and temporal correlations ( i.e. , @xmath0 happens before @xmath1 ) between @xmath2 shear , turbulence levels , and transport ; ( b ) comparing growth and damping rates ( @xmath3 vs.  @xmath4 )  @xcite or energy transfer rates  @xcite ; ( c ) controlling @xmath5 and the @xmath2 shear externally and observing the effect  @xcite , and ( d ) looking for ` precursors ' of a confinement transition  @xcite .",
    "these methods often rely on observing variations on a slow time scale by averaging out the fast time scale of turbulent fluctuations .",
    "however , the confinement transition relies , precisely , on an interaction between the slow _ and _ fast time scales , and it may well be that this averaging operation eliminates essential information , thus precluding the clarification of causal relationships .",
    "one analysis method that avoids this issue ( of averaging out information ) is the calculation of the energy transfer involved in quadric three - wave coupling , based on the bispectrum  @xcite .",
    "this energy transfer reveals the direction of energy flow in fourier space .",
    "however , bispectral techniques rely on a number of rather strong assumptions such as weak turbulence with dominant quadratic interactions and a stationary state , and requires rather lengthy time series for reliable results .",
    "by contrast , the approach discussed here , based on the transfer entropy , is more generic and less dependent on underlying assumptions .",
    "the goal of this work , therefore , is to study whether the transfer entropy technique can provide an answer to the causality questions of the type ` which variable influences which other ' in a highly non - linear situation characterized by various coupled variables or fields in a magnetically confined plasma . for this purpose",
    ", we will analyze a few model systems considered relevant and analyze experimental data from the tj - k and tj - ii stellarators .",
    "the data are selected for their relevance to the study of the interaction between zonal flows  @xcite and turbulence .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ method ] ,",
    "we outline the method and perform some tests on relevant models of systems with non - linearly interacting variables . in section",
    "[ results ] , we present some analysis results for data obtained in fusion devices , relevant in the framework of zonal flows and confinement transitions . finally , in section [ discussion ] , we discuss the findings and draw some conclusions .",
    "consider two processes @xmath1 and @xmath0 yielding discretely sampled time series data @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the data are assumed to correspond to a stationary state ; any slow drifts of measurement signals have been removed by subjecting the time series to a suitable trend removal , if necessary .",
    "their mutual information is defined as @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a ( joint ) probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "it quantifies the mutual reduction of uncertainty of one of the variables due to knowledge of the other one , expressed in amount of bits .",
    "the mutual information @xmath10 if and only if @xmath1 and @xmath0 are statistically independent , in which case @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the mutual information detects common information content between the processes @xmath1 and @xmath0 but does not reveal the direction of information flow ( if any ) . for this purpose , the temporal structure of the data patterns must be taken into consideration .",
    "we introduce the multi - indices @xmath12 and @xmath13 , such that the indices @xmath14 are monotonically increasing , i.e. , @xmath15 and similar for @xmath16 .",
    "we will use the shorthand notation @xmath17 to indicate a set of @xmath18 data values preceding or coinciding with the time associated with time index @xmath19 , and likewise @xmath20 .",
    "a measure of information transfer between the two time series @xmath1 and @xmath0 is given by the _ transfer entropy _",
    "@xcite : @xmath21 the sum runs over the arguments of the probability distributions ( or the corresponding bins , cf .  next section ) .",
    "the reason for using multi - indices ( a minor extension of  @xcite ) is to allow the possibility of including various time scales of influence on the effect variable .",
    "the transfer entropy can be rewritten in the form of a conditional mutual information  @xcite .",
    "it measures the excess amount of bits needed to encode the information of the process @xmath1 at time point @xmath22 with respect to the assumption that this information is independent from @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , the transfer entropy is an implementation of wiener s ` quantifiable causality ' . if @xmath0 has no influence on the immediate future evolution of system @xmath1 , one has @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 can be compared to @xmath26 to uncover a net information flow .",
    "using @xmath27 , eq .",
    "( [ te ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath28 thus , computing @xmath25 requires estimating four multi - dimensional probability distributions .      here , the probability distributions appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ te]),([te1 ] ) are calculated using a discrete binning of @xmath29 bins in each coordinate direction .",
    "the main joint pdf @xmath30 has @xmath31 dimensions , so there are @xmath32 bins , and this number should be much smaller than the available length of the data arrays , @xmath33 , in order to obtain a statistically significant sampling of the pdf .    in plasma physics applications , the available stationary time series are usually rather short ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this inevitably means that @xmath29 , @xmath35 , and @xmath18 should all be small . choosing a small @xmath29 value ( 2 or 3 )",
    "is called ` coarse graining ' . for the same reason , we will set @xmath36 in this work .",
    "this means that @xmath37 and @xmath16 are scalar indices instead of vector indices , and that their value must be chosen judiciously in order to capture the historic information that has the most significant impact on the future evolution of the signals .",
    "this introduces the problem of selecting an appropriate value of @xmath38 .",
    "if the signals are oscillatory , the period of oscillation can be determined and @xmath37 and @xmath16 should correspond to a time interval less than about one quarter of the oscillation period .",
    "when the signal is not clearly oscillatory or has multiple oscillations , the ( linear ) decorrelation time can be used as a guide for choosing @xmath37 and @xmath16 . in strongly chaotic , nonlinear , or turbulent systems",
    ", it is probably better to use the mutual information to determine this value , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . to do so",
    ", one replaces @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ mutualinfo ] ) with a delayed version of @xmath1 and computes @xmath39 for a set of delay times @xmath40 ; in the following , we shall refer to this quantity as the self - mutual information . in any case",
    ", the transfer entropy results should not be excessively sensitive to the precise choice of @xmath37 and @xmath16 provided the preceding guidelines are followed , which can be tested by varying their values and observing the outcome .",
    "in the remainder of this chapter , we will perform some tests using well - understood though non - trivial models .",
    "a system of @xmath41 coupled van der pol oscillators may exhibit chaos without external driving .",
    "such a system is described by : @xmath42y_i- \\left ( x_i+\\sum_j { \\kappa_{ij}x_j}\\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath43 determines the limit cycle of oscillator @xmath44 ( for @xmath45 ) , while @xmath46 specifies the non - linear coupling between oscillator @xmath44 and oscillator @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "we have run a simulation with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 meaning that there are two oscillators with slightly different limit cycles , while oscillator 2 affects oscillator 1 ( but not vice versa ) . with this choice of parameters ,",
    "the system is in a quasi - periodic state .",
    "time was integrated from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , and 10000 equally spaced data points were saved for analysis . only the time interval from @xmath53 to @xmath52",
    "was used for analysis in order to remove the initial transient phase .",
    "a section of data is shown in fig .",
    "[ pol_data ] .    from a spectral analysis ,",
    "the mean oscillation period of the signals was about 6.72 , corresponding to about 67 samples per period .",
    "thus , @xmath54 should be chosen less than about 17 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the latter value ( 17 ) also roughly corresponds to the first minimum of the self - mutual information of @xmath56 .",
    "the selected data are analyzed with @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "net information flow from signal @xmath44 to signal @xmath47 is computed as @xmath59 , where the indices @xmath60 correspond to the signals @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the following net transfer entropy matrix is obtained ( only the part of the matrix above the diagonal is shown ; the remainder follows from antisymmetry ) : @xmath62 this can be represented graphically by drawing 4 dots representing the 4 signals in a plane , cf .",
    "[ pol_flow ] .",
    "the four dots are connected by arrows , such that the direction of the arrow indicates the direction of net information flow , while the width of the arrow is proportional to the value @xmath63 .",
    "there is a strong flow from @xmath64 to @xmath56 ( corresponding to @xmath65 ) .",
    "this non - trivial component corresponds to the fact that @xmath66 is such that oscillator 2 affects oscillator 1 ( but not vice versa ) .",
    "another strong flow is from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , for the same reason .",
    "the flow from @xmath64 to @xmath67 ( @xmath70 ) is trivial ( cf .",
    "( [ pol ] ) ) .",
    "the remaining arrows are smaller , so that it is clear that the information flow is dominantly from oscillator 2 to oscillator 1 .",
    "therefore , the analysis technique correctly recovers the direction of coupling among the components of the system .",
    "the stability of the analysis method was tested by computing the transfer entropy for a varying length of the data arrays , @xmath33 .",
    "[ pol_convergence ] shows @xmath71 ( the transfer entropy from signal 1 , @xmath56 , to signal 3 , @xmath64 ) and @xmath72 ( the transfer entropy from signal 3 , @xmath64 , to signal 1 , @xmath56 ) versus @xmath33 , with the analysis settings as in the previous paragraph .",
    "it is seen that @xmath73 converges to a stable value for @xmath74 , a rather modest number .",

    "the value of the transfer entropy @xmath73 , expressed in bits , can be calibrated against the total bit range , @xmath76 , implying that the coupling strength is quite significant .    to understand the evolution of the transfer entropy with the analysis parameters @xmath38 , we calculated @xmath65 ( which specifies the net flow from signal 1 , @xmath56 , to signal 3 , @xmath64 ) for a range of @xmath54 values , cf .",

    "the graph shows that the net information transfer from @xmath56 to @xmath64 is negative for @xmath77 ( as it should , for we know that the information transfer should go from oscillator 2 to oscillator 1 ) . for higher values of @xmath38 , the net flow changes sign .",
    "this occurs when crossing the quarter - period value ( 17 ) or minimum self - mutual information value ( 17 ) , and is caused by the fact that this system is quasi - periodic .",
    "it seems important , therefore , to keep @xmath38 well below the mentioned reference values .      in the context of fusion plasmas , spontaneous confinement transitions are of prime interest . in recent years",

    "in this section , we will use the model of ref .",
    "@xcite to generate signals for analysis using the transfer entropy technique .",

    "in this section , we will apply the transfer entropy technique to data obtained from various magnetic confinement devices .",
    "the data have been selected for their relevance to the study of the interaction between zonal flows and turbulence .",
    "zonal flows are large scale electrostatic potential structures that form spontaneously in magnetically confined toroidal fusion plasmas , and have zero toroidal wavenumber , small or zero poloidal wavenumber and finite radial wavenumber  @xcite .",
    "the global nature of these structures makes them hard to identify , as most measurements ( of potential or radial electric field ) are local . in the following",
    ", we will not worry about the precise identification of zonal flows , but confide in earlier published analyses showing that the presented data pertain to zonal flows with high probability .",
    "our main goal here is to analyze the interaction between these hypothetical zonal flows ( identified via potential or radial electric field fluctuations ) and turbulence ( identified via the density fluctuation amplitude or radial particle transport flux ) .      here",
    ", we analyze data from the tj - k stellarator , a torsatron operated at low magnetic field ( @xmath89 mt ) and low plasma beta .",
    "the discharge analyzed here corresponds to a helium plasma , heated by microwaves , with a central density of @xmath90 m@xmath91 and an electron temperature of @xmath92 ev and cold ions , as reported in more detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "in this experiment , turbulence was dominated by electrostatic drift wave turbulence , and the total particle transport and zonal potential were found to be linked in a predator - prey cycle . among other diagnostics ,",
    "the device disposes of a set of 64 langmuir probes , distributed over a poloidal circumference of the device .",
    "the probes are configured to measure floating potential and ion saturation current in an alternating fashion , at a sampling rate of 1 mhz . from these signals , we compute the zonal potential @xmath93 as the mean poloidal value of the floating potential , and the global radial particle flux @xmath94 as the poloidal mean of the local radial particle flux , proportional to the fluctuating ion saturation current times the local poloidal electric field , as described in more detail in the cited reference . we quantify the ` global turbulence level ' by computing the root mean square ( rms ) deviation of the 32 poloidally distributed ion saturation current measurements ( @xmath95 ) , thus obtaining a quantifier of the turbulence level with the same time resolution as @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "a short section of data is shown in fig .",
    "[ tjk_data ] ; clearly , these data are much less regular than the model data shown in the preceding section , making it considerably more difficult to understand the nonlinear relationship between the signals .",
    "we apply the analysis described above , setting @xmath58 ( coarse graining ) .",
    "[ tjk ] shows the transfer entropy between the two signals @xmath93 and @xmath94 as a function of @xmath96 .",
    "the amplitude of the transfer entropy is rather small , namely below @xmath97 , compared to the full bit range @xmath98 , which indicates that the causal link between these variables is not very strong .",
    "nevertheless , it is unexpected and interesting to observe that @xmath99 and @xmath100 peak at different values of @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath99 peaks at about 20 @xmath101s , while @xmath100 peaks at about 60 @xmath101s .",

    "it flows from @xmath102 to @xmath103 for time scales less than about 40 @xmath101s , and in the opposite direction for longer time scales .",
    "the two distinct time scales for mutual interaction would immediately give rise to oscillatory behavior , as indeed observed .",
    "this seems coherent with the usual predator - prey models for the interaction between zonal flow and turbulence .    in the standard zonal flow model",

    ", the transport affects the zonal flow , but the interaction with the turbulence level is insignificant .",
    "the short time scale result is interesting , as it confirms the analysis of  @xcite , where it was observed that the zonal flow does not affect the turbulence amplitude strongly , but rather it affects the transport ( as noted in the cited paper , by modifying the phase relation between density and potential fluctuations ) .",
    "the modification of the transport then affects the turbulence amplitude .",
    "although there is an arrow showing that the zonal potential also affects the turbulence level directly , its strength is much less than the indirect route via the turbulent transport .",

    "a similar analysis was made for two discharges with initial subcritical density in which external biasing was applied between @xmath132 and @xmath133 ms .",
    "a biasing probe was inserted about 2 cm into the plasma and biased with respect to a poloidal limiter tangent to the last closed flux surface .",
    "the triple langmuir probe was inserted to normalized radius @xmath134 .",
    "detailed information about these discharges can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "when applying positive biasing , turbulence was suppressed , leading to an improvement of confinement such that the density rose to values exceeding the critical density for spontaneous transitions ( @xmath135 ) ; however , contrary to the spontaneous confinement transition , here @xmath123 remains positive .",
    "[ 16014_16015 ] shows the evolution of @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "it is clear that biasing has a strong effect on these quantities .    comparing the spontaneous and biasing - induced confinement transitions",
    ", one observes that @xmath137 is large for @xmath138 with the spontaneous transition , while it is large for @xmath135 with the induced transition .",
    "the explanation for this apparent contradiction is related to the evolution of the mean electric field profile @xmath139 , and will be addressed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the analysis of the causal relation between fluctuating variables is of prime interest when studying complex nonlinear systems , and fundamental to reach a full understanding of such systems and develop realistic models . in this work ,",
    "we use the concept of ` causality ' in the restricted sense referred to in section [ introduction ] ( wiener s ` quantifiable causality ' ) .    the transfer entropy technique  @xcite allows detecting a causal relation between variables that does not require very lengthy time series ( although stationary state is still a requirement ) and that does not rely on the assumption of weak turbulence .",
    "in essence , the analysis is based on the observation of a ( significant ) number of repetitive event sequences occurring in a pair of time series , which however may occur in an irregular manner .    as is the case with all methods for causality detection",
    ", an important caveat is due .",
    "the method only detects the information transfer between measured variables .",
    "if the net information flow suggests a causal link between two such variables , this may either be due to a direct cause / effect relation ( in the restricted sense referred to above ) , or due to the presence of a third , undetected variable that affects both ( e.g. , with different delays , thus generating an _ apparent _ causal relation ) .",
    "thus , physical insight into the system is always needed to determine whether all relevant variables are being measured and to decide whether the net information flow actually corresponds to a causal link .      when computing the transfer entropy for numerical data generated by multivariate nonlinear models , it was found that the direction of interaction between system variables could be recovered .",
    "e.g. , in the system of two coupled van der pol oscillators , it was clearly established that oscillator 2 affected oscillator 1 , but not vice versa , in accordance with the design of the system .",
    "a similar statement can be made for the simplified predator - prey model .",
    "numerical convergence of the analysis was tested and guidelines for an efficient choice of analysis parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath37 , and @xmath16 ) are provided .",
    "we have explored the application of this technique to some data from turbulent fusion plasmas .",
    "the selected measurement data are relevant to the understanding of the important confinement transition , in which turbulence spontaneously generates a more ordered plasma state with reduced radial transport .",
    "the analysis of the global potential and flux at tj - k revealed the existence of two time scales : 20 and 60 @xmath101s . on the short time scale ,",
    "the zonal flow potential was shown to affect transport , which in turn affected turbulence .",
    "on the longer time scale , the transport affected the zonal flow potential , which was hypothesized to be due to a restoration of ambipolarity .",
    "the short time scale result is in accordance with the previous analysis of  @xcite , whereas the longer time scale result is novel and reveals the potential significance of the technique to uncover new relationships .",
    "doppler reflectometry data from tj - ii taken across l  i and l  h transitions in nbi heated plasmas showed how the fluctuating perpendicular flow velocity @xmath117 , again associated with zonal flows , affects the turbulence . across the l ",
    "h transition , @xmath111 was found to increase sharply , while the reverse interaction @xmath112 remained fairly constant . however , the l ",
    "i transition was characterized by an increase in _ both _ these quantities ( @xmath111 being dominant ) .",
    "the i - phase is characterized by quasi - periodic predator - prey oscillations  @xcite , which however occur on a rather slow time scale ( of the order of a ms ) compared to the interactions found here , occurring on a @xmath101s time scale .",
    "of course , if the predator - prey oscillations affect the turbulence , as one assumes must be the case , then this effect must be detectable on this fast time scale .",
    "this seems to be what the transfer entropy succeeds in doing .",
    "note that the interaction between the slow time scale of the predator - prey cycle and the fast time scale of the turbulence autocorrelation time was hinted at already in a previous analysis based on the bicoherence  @xcite .",
    "langmuir probe data from tj - ii taken across a low - density confinement transition in an ecr heated plasma show how the transfer entropy between the fluctuating radial electric field ( associated with zonal flows ) and the particle flux , @xmath137 , gradually grows prior to the transition and essentially disappears once the transition has taken place .",
    "by contrast , during bias - induced transitions in ecr heated plasmas , @xmath137 increases sharply while biasing is applied .",
    "the observed behavior of the transfer entropy in ecr heated plasmas can perhaps be understood as follows . in the case of the spontaneous transition in ecr heated plasmas",
    ", @xmath137 increases gradually as the density is raised towards the critical value , which is interpreted as a gradual growth of the zonal flow amplitude .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath140 increases , which is interpreted as the build - up of reynolds stress , expected to produce a ( steady state ) sheared flow .",
    "however , as the density is raised slowly , the plasma adjust the profiles in an attempt to maintain the ambipolarity condition . at a certain point ,",
    "the electron root solution of the ambipolarity equation disappears . immediately prior to this point ,",
    "the flow susceptibility is large ( i.e. , small changes in the ambipolar flux are associated with large changes in @xmath5 ) , which can be interpreted in terms of a low neoclassical viscosity  @xcite , leading to large amplitude zonal flows , consistent with the observed gradual growth of @xmath137 as the critical density is approached from below . following the transition to the ion root state , flow susceptibility is suddenly strongly reduced ( neoclassical viscosity is high ) , so that zonal flows are strongly damped ,",
    "which is consistent with the disappearance of both @xmath137 and @xmath140 as the critical density is crossed .    in the case of the biasing discharges , @xmath137 and",
    "@xmath140 increase sharply when the biasing is activated . from previous work",
    "it is known that the externally applied radial electric field gives rise to long range correlations  @xcite , which is consistent with the formation of a zonal flow , associated with the observed growth of @xmath137 and @xmath140 .",
    "a possible explanation may be that the imposed electric field enhances the ambipolar electric field value ( while remaining in the electron root state ) and correspondingly enhances the flow susceptibility , leading to zonal flow enhancement .    comparing the tj - k and tj - ii results",
    ", we note that the amplitude of the transfer entropy is about an order of magnitude higher in the latter device",
    ". presumably , this corresponds to a larger zonal flow amplitude generated by a stronger drive ( steeper gradients ) .    from the numerical and experimental examples examined in this work",
    ", it is concluded that the transfer entropy constitutes a powerful tool to unravel the causal relationship between nonlinearly interacting fields in complex systems .",
    "it is expected that this technique may find applications in many fields of research .",
