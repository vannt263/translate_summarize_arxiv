    "in the last two decades the field of non - equilibrium thermodynamics has undergone a tremendous advancement due to the discovery of exact non - equilibrium relations ( named fluctuation relations ) which characterize non - equilibrium processes well beyond the regime of linear response , and provide a deep insight into statistical nature and microscopic origin of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the most prominent example of such exact relations is the jarzynski equality @xcite which allows for obtaining the free energy landscape of small systems , like a single dna molecule , from very many measurements of work done on the system as it is driven out of equilibrium , e.g. , by stretching the molecule @xcite .",
    "a related result , known as crooks work fluctuation theorem @xcite , relates the free energy to the probability of performing work @xmath0 during the process and the probability of performing work @xmath1 during the time - reversed process .",
    "these results , which have been first obtained within the framework of classical mechanics were later derived also within the quantum mechanical framework @xcite .",
    "the crucial ingredient needed for obtaining the fluctuation relations in the quantum case is the so called _ two measurements scheme _ @xcite . in this scheme",
    "the system energy is measured at the beginning and end of the driving protocol and the work is defined as the difference of the outcomes of these measurements : @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes an eigenvalue of the ( time - dependent ) hamilton operator @xmath4 at time @xmath5 . as usual , here it is assumed the hamilton operator changes in time due to the time dependence of an external parameter @xmath6 .",
    "this scheme relies on the von neumann measurement postulate according to which the measurement process induces the collapse of the wave function on one of the eigenstates of the measured observable , i.e , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the present case .",
    "notably , experimental verification and application of the quantum fluctuation relations based on the two - measurement scheme have not been accomplished yet , while alternative strategies aimed at avoiding the two projective measurements have been proposed .",
    "two prominent examples propose to replace them with many weak measurements during the driving protocol @xcite , or with state tomography of one or two qubit ancillae appropriately coupled to the driven system @xcite    with this work we establish _ new _ quantum fluctuation relations , which look exactly like the standard quantum fluctuation relations but substantially differ from them due to a different underlying definition of quantum work , and a different ensemble specifying the initial condition . as in the standard case @xcite",
    "we assume an initial statistical ensemble , but at variance with the ordinary quantum statistical mechanics , we assume that the statistical ensemble is described by a distribution of wave functions as originally suggested by schrdinger @xcite , later pursued by khinchin @xcite and recently advocated by an increasing number of authors @xcite",
    ". we will establish fluctuation relations for the microcanonical @xcite and canonical @xcite wave function ensembles .",
    "most remarkably these new fluctuation relations naturally involve a notion of work as the change in the _ expectation _ of the hamiltonian operator @xmath9 accordingly they do not involve von neumann measurement postulate . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w - nomeas ] ) @xmath10 is a wave function randomly chosen from the distribution , and @xmath11 is its time evolution . just as with the classical fluctuation theorems ,",
    "the stochastic nature of @xmath12 comes from the fact that the initial state @xmath10 is randomly drawn from a distribution , while its evolution is deterministic .",
    "so , the interpretation framework that is adopted here is that experimentally observed quantities correspond to their quantum mechanical _ expectation _ , an approach that is at least as common in the scientific literature and effective as that involving wave function collapses . to give one example ,",
    "kubo s linear response theory @xcite , is a theory of quantum expectations which mentions no collapses . this same philosophy has been advocated by g. jona - lasinio and c. presilla @xcite , who pointed out that the wave function ensembles could be good candidates for the study of mesoscopic systems , where robust coherence phenomena are involved .",
    "we consider a quantum system with a finite dimensional hilbert space of dimension @xmath13 .",
    "each wave function @xmath14 can be represented by an @xmath13 dimensional complex vector @xmath15 , and the system hamilton operator @xmath16 can be represented by a @xmath17 hermitean matrix @xmath18 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we introduce the suggestive notation @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath15 , @xmath22 denotes the expectation of the hamilton operator on the state @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes transpose of @xmath25 , and matrix multiplication is implied .",
    "we stress that @xmath20 and @xmath21 should not be confused with positions and momenta .    below we shall consider statistical ensembles @xmath26 defined on the wave function `` phase space '' @xmath27 .",
    "given an observable @xmath28 , with matrix representation @xmath29 , its ensemble average is its wave function expectation @xmath30 , averaged over the wave function distribution , namely @xmath31      in the microcanonical wave function ensemble @xcite all wave functions @xmath27 with a given expectation of energy @xmath32 have same probability , whereas all other wave functions have probability zero . for a fixed @xmath33",
    "it reads : @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes dirac s delta function , and @xmath36 is the density of states .",
    "note the formal similarity with the classical microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the main the difference is the presence of the extra factor @xmath37 which restricts the integration to the `` physical hilbert space '' , namely the subspace of normalized wave functions , also known as the projective hilbert space .",
    "note that at variance with the textbook quantum microcanonical ensemble @xcite , in which only those eigenstates of the hamiltonian in a narrow interval around the energy @xmath38 contribute , here all eigenstates participate to the ensemble .",
    "particle in a ( possibly large ) magnetic field , @xmath39 , and consider the microcanonical ensemble of states with expectation @xmath40 . besides the state with null angular momentum ( the only state contributing to the standard microcanonical ensemble ) , superposition containing both the up and down states now contribute to the ensemble as well . ] for this reason various authors claim that the ensemble in eq .",
    "( [ eq : microcan ] ) provides a more realistic description of the thermodynamics of isolated systems @xcite .",
    "another pleasing property of this ensemble is that , at variance with the standard microcanonical ensemble , it does not require a dense energy spectrum , and can therefore be well applied to small quantum systems with well separated energy levels .",
    "indeed , the ensemble depends continuously on the real parameters @xmath41 , which makes the derivation of the associated thermodynamics straightforward also in case of small systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite shows that this ensemble well describes the statistics of a small thermally isolated system after repeated non - adiabatic perturbations .      in the canonical wave function ensemble @xcite ,",
    "wave functions are weighted with the gibbs factor @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 note again the formal similarity with the classical canonical ensemble . in ref .",
    "@xcite this ensemble is called the schrdinger - gibbs ensemble . according to @xcite",
    "this ensemble can give realistic predictions in case of mesoscopic systems where robust coherence phenomena are involved .",
    "a criterion for establishing the goodness of a statistical ensembles as a candidate model of equilibrium thermodynamics is whether the ensemble is invariant under the time evolution .",
    "as will become clearer in the next section this is indeed the case for the canonical and microcanonical wave function ensemble .",
    "another criterion , which traces back to boltzmann @xcite , is whether the ensemble endows the parameter space with a `` thermodynamic structure '' . to be more explicit , given a statistical ensemble @xmath45 , ( defined on a phase space @xmath46 and on a parameter space @xmath47 ) , one checks whether there exist an integrating factor @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the heat differential as calculated in the ensemble .",
    "this equation is known as the _ heat theorem _ , and is the most fundamental equation of thermodynamics .",
    "prominent examples of textbooks that take this viewpoint in establishing the foundations of quantum statistics are those of schrdingier @xcite , and khinchin @xcite .    to calculate @xmath50 use the standard formula @xmath51 where @xmath52 denote the ensemble averages of energy and of the generalized force conjugated to the external parameter .",
    "note that in case of a single parameter @xmath33 , mathematics ensures that an integrating factor always exists .",
    "a differential form in two dimensions ( i.e. , @xmath38 and @xmath33 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaq ] ) ) , always admits an integrating factor .",
    "however , the system hamiltonian may depend on many external parameters @xmath53 , hence @xmath54 , which makes the question of the existence of an integrating factor non - trivial .      in the canonical case we have @xmath55 in this case",
    "@xmath56 is an integrating factor for @xmath50 and @xmath57 is the associated generating function .",
    "the argument follows step by step the classical derivation @xcite , which can be repeated without modifications .",
    "the partial derivatives of @xmath58 are : @xmath59 therefore @xmath60 the derivation can be straightforwardly repeated in the case of many parameters .",
    "we remark that there are however infinitely many integrating factors for @xmath50 .",
    "so having found one does not ensure by itself that it can be interpreted as inverse temperature , and that the associated generator of the exact differential can be interpreted as entropy .",
    "take for example @xmath61 with any monotonic function @xmath62 .",
    "then @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the derivative of @xmath62 .",
    "this says that @xmath65 , is also an integrating factor for @xmath50 . in order to pick the `` thermodynamic '' integrating factor , we need an extra ingredient .",
    "we thus further require that the entropy be additive .",
    "namely , if two non interacting and non - entangled systems have separately the entropies @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the entropy of the total system should be @xmath68 .",
    "the requirement of non - entanglement is very crucial here .",
    "it restricts the hilbert space of the compound system , from a tensor product of dimension @xmath69 to the direct product of dimension @xmath70 . in this `` classical '' phase space",
    "the canonical wave function distribution of the compound system reduces to the product of the canonical wave function distributions for each subsystem , so does the partition function @xmath71 . noting that the energy is additive",
    ", it follows that @xmath58 is additive as well , which singles it out as a good candidate for thermodynamic entropy .",
    "accordingly @xmath56 is the inverse temperature .      in the microcanonical case",
    "@xmath72 an integrating factor for @xmath50 is in this case the function @xmath73 , where , in analogy with classical mechanics @xmath74 denotes the volume of physical hilbert space with energy expectation below @xmath38 . as in classical mechanics",
    ", we have @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the ground state energy .",
    "the symbol @xmath77 denotes the heaviside step function .",
    "the proof follows , _ mutatis mutandis _ , the classical argument ( the generalized helmholtz theorem ) @xcite , which can be repeated also with many external parameters .",
    "the generating function associated with the integrating factor @xmath78 is @xmath79 . in this case",
    "the requirement of additivity does not seem to single @xmath80 so straightforwardly as in the canonical case .",
    "the reason is that , unlike the exponential , the theta function does not factorize in the product of two theta functions .",
    "classically this problem can be easily circumvented upon noticing that the integrating factor @xmath78 equals the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom ( equipartition theorem @xcite ) , which singles it out as the thermodynamic temperature . in quantum mechanics",
    "however there is no equipartition theorem to help us .",
    "we leave the resolution of this question to future studies .",
    "it should be remarked that our present analysis contrasts with ref .",
    "@xcite , where thermodynamics was derived from the logarithm of the density of states , namely @xmath81 .",
    "we remark that this choice does not comply with the heat theorem , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hameqs ] ) , namely , there does not exist , in general a function @xmath82 , such that @xmath83 would equal the differential of @xmath84 .",
    "this very same question appears also at the classical level , where it has been long ignored due to the fact that in most cases of interest the `` surface entropy '' ( logarithm of the density of states ) and the `` volume entropy '' ( logarithm of the integrated density of states ) , give practically undistinguishable results for sufficiently large systems @xcite .",
    "fluctuation relations for the wave function ensembles follow straightforwardly upon noticing that in the @xmath27 representation , the schrdinger equation @xmath85 assumes the form of classical hamilton s equation @xmath86 with the function @xmath87 being the generator of the dynamics @xcite . in analogy with the classical case , we introduce the following notion of quantum work @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes the evolved of @xmath27 , according to hamilton s equations ( [ eq : hameqs ] ) . physically , @xmath12 is the change in the expectation of the hamilton operator @xmath90 , due to the evolution of the wave function @xmath91 , see eq .",

    "the probability that the work @xmath12 be performed on a system prepared in a wave function ensemble @xmath26 can be written as @xmath93 noticing that the evolution ( [ eq : hameqs ] ) conserves the normalization , @xmath94 ( unitarity of quantum evolution ) and is volume preserving , @xmath95 ( classical liouville theorem ) , one can repeat step by step the derivations of classical microcanonical @xcite and canonical @xcite fluctuation relations , upon requiring that the hamilton operator is time reversal invariant . , the hamilton operator @xmath4 commutes with time - reversal operator @xmath96 , which changes the sign of momenta and leaves spatial coordinates unchanged @xcite ]    in the microcanonical case one obtains : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the probability of doing work @xmath12 when the initial state is randomly drawn from the distribution @xmath99 under the driving protocol @xmath6 @xmath100 $ ] , and @xmath101 is the probability of doing work @xmath102 when the initial state is randomly drawn from @xmath103 under the protocol @xmath104 , @xmath100 $ ] .    in the canonical case one",

    "we have introduced the notation @xmath110 , with @xmath111 .",
