    "data that may be modeled by distributions having heavy tails appear in many contexts , for example , hydrology ( @xcite ) , finance ( @xcite ) , insurance ( @xcite ) , internet traffic ( @xcite ) , social networks and random graphs ( @xcite ) and risk management ( @xcite ) . empirical evidence often indicates heavy - tailed marginal distributions and the dependence structure between the various components must be discerned .",
    "we focus here on the case where components are strongly dependent .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , the paper encourages a definition of strong asymptotic or extremal dependence that means the limit measure of regular variation concentrates on a cone smaller than the full state space .",
    "thus , directions where multivariate data from such a model are found fall in a restricted set .",
    "secondly , the paper shows that strong asymptotic dependence is a tractable case for the applicability of _ hidden regular variation_.    hidden regular variation ( hrv ) @xcite is often considered for multivariate data exhibiting heavy tails when _ asymptotic independence _",
    "is present .",
    "asymptotic independence in a bivariate data set of positive values implies that both coordinates can not be large simultaneously and therefore the multivariate regular variation ( mrv ) limit measure concentrates on the co - ordinate axes . to improve risk estimation ,",
    "one then seeks hrv on the non - negative orthant after removing the two axes .",
    "however , hidden regular variation is applicable whenever the limit measure of regular variation in standard scale concentrates on a cone which is smaller than the entire state space , and is not restricted to the case of asymptotic independence ; see for details .",
    "if the limit measure of regular variation concentrates on a relatively small cone , a risk calculation of a region in the complement of the support of the limit measure will yield an answer of zero and hrv has the potential to produce positive estimates of such risks .",
    "we distinguish two related cases :    1 .",
    "_ full asymptotic dependence : _ the mrv limit measure concentrates in standard scale on a single diagonal ray .",
    "strong asymptotic dependence : _ the mrv limit measure in standard scale concentrates on a relatively small cone about the diagonal .",
    "this case is illustrated by analyzing out- and in - degree for facebook wall posts and returns of chevron vs exxon .",
    "the variables in these examples are highly dependent , but they are not fully asymptotically dependent . in our experience , it is much easier to find examples of strong asymptotic dependence compared with full asymptotic dependence .",
    "we review and adapt general model generation and detection techniques based on the generalized polar coordinate transform ; see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the model generation methods produce tractable models and the methods are illustrated in sections [ ex : sim1 ] and [ ex : sim2 ] .",
    "the detection methods show when regularly varying models are consistent with data .",
    "we apply the detection methods to the data examples of strong asymptotic dependence .",
    "the mathematical framework for the study of multivariate heavy tails is regular variation of measures .",
    "the theory is flexible when given for closed subcones of metric spaces @xcite ; we specialize to subcones of @xmath0 and @xmath1 where statistical results are most readily exhibited .",
    "statistical extensions to higher dimensions are possible and require more sophisticated graphics .",
    "we list needed notation in section [ subsec : notation ] for reference .",
    "the definitions of multivariate regular variation ( mrv ) and hidden regular variation ( hrv ) are reviewed in section [ subsec : regvarmod ] where general concepts are adapted for subcones in two dimensions .",
    "sections [ subsec : polar ] and [ subsec : mrvhrv ] give equivalent formulations in polar co - ordinates and discuss the particular cases of strong and full dependence .",
    "section [ subsec : hillish ] gives techniques for detecting when data is consistent with a model exhibiting mrv and hrv .",
    "these techniques rely on the fact that under broad conditions , if a vector @xmath2 has a multivariate regularly varying distribution on a cone @xmath3 , then under a _ generalized polar coordinate transformation _ ( see ) , the transformed vector satisfies a conditional extreme value ( cev ) model for which detection techniques exist from @xcite .",
    "this methodology adds to the toolbox of one dimensional techniques such as checking if one dimensional marginal distributions are heavy tailed or checking whether one dimensional functions of the data vector such as the maximum and the minimum component are heavy tailed .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite . in section [ sec : dataanal ] , we analyze real and simulated data and show that our estimation and detection techniques produce results consistent with presence of both mrv with strong dependence and hrv .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] presents concluding comments .",
    "we provide a brief review of the mathematical setup for multivariate regularly varying measures with the notion of @xmath4-convergence .",
    "more detail is found in @xcite .",
    "the notions of hidden regular variation ( hrv ) and regular variation expressed by polar coordinate transforms are discussed in sections [ subsec : regvarmod ] and [ subsec : polar ] with emphasis on cases of the _ strong asymptotic dependence_. finally in section [ subsec : hillish ] we discuss detection of hrv using the hillish estimator .",

    "this is estimated using a hill plot of points comprised of @xmath351 for @xmath352 and @xmath353 for @xmath354 for different choices of @xmath355 . in figure",

    "the estimates clearly move away from the actual value @xmath255 as the size of the support decreases . when we take @xmath357 the data points used to estimate @xmath296 are a subset of the points used to estimate @xmath296 when @xmath348 , and thus are regularly varying with parameter @xmath255 ; hence the hill plot clearly hugs the horizontal line at @xmath358 . as the size of the support set decreases we see the hill",
    "estimates become lower than @xmath359 and moves towards @xmath248 .",
    "we also observe in figure [ fig : sim2_hillish_err ] that the hillish plots are not that close to the horizontal line at height 1 when the support is not correctly identified ; in this case @xmath300 . in comparison ,",
    "figure [ fig : hillish_sim2 ] clearly shows that the hillish plots are close to 1 , when the support is correctly specified",
    ".    finally we estimate probabilities @xmath360 and @xmath361 when the support sets are identified incorrectly .",
    "figure [ fig : estimates_sim2_alt1 ] corresponds to boxplots of @xmath362 and @xmath289 where @xmath363 uses the estimators given in , with @xmath296 computed using @xmath364 and @xmath365 uses @xmath366 . observe that the boxplots are quite close to 1 , since @xmath296 is estimated well . on the other hand in figure [ fig : estimates_sim2_alt2 ] ,",
    "the similar boxplots are done for @xmath300 . in this case , @xmath296 is not that well - estimated and hence the boxplots are clearly away from 1 .",
    "in both cases , 100 replications of data sets with 10,000 data points in each were used to create the boxplots .    in conclusion",
    "we can see that an incorrect identification of the support of regular variation can often lead to incorrect estimates .",
    "although if the identified support of hidden regular variation is a bit smaller than the correct one ( which means that the identified support of mrv is larger than the correct one ) , then the estimates are still quite accurate .",
    "we now analyze two real data sets : ( i ) facebook wall posts and ( ii ) returns from exxon and chevron .",

    "the scatter plot in figure [ fig : fbwallscatter ] is less clear than for simulated data and shows points dispersed from the main cluster about the diagonal and so the estimates of the support of @xmath369 in the diamond plot are not as evident as in figure [ fig:1stquadrant_facebook ] .",

    "the qq and althill plots for the region @xmath372 $ ] are given in figure [ fig : facebk0alpha0 ] .",
    "the evidence for hrv is further strengthened by excellent hillish plots described in section [ subsec : hillish ] applied to the generalized polar coordinates @xmath379 as descibed in . both hillish plots in figure [ fig : fb_gpolar ] hug the horizontal line at height 1 .",
    "$ ] .,height=240 ]    the diamond plot in figure [ fig:1stquadrant_facebook ] shows the presence of points on the line @xmath380 with small values of @xmath381 , corresponding to two dimensional points in @xmath373 $ ] .",
    "previously the estimation of the range of the angular measure of the primary regular variation discounted these points .",
    "however , the estimation of the tail index of the distance to @xmath40 $ ] being @xmath382 , the same as the marginal distribution indices of ( out , in ) , suggests an alternate model which lumps together @xmath40\\cup[<\\smallwedge]$ ] as the region of concentration for the limit measure @xmath76 of the primary regular variation in .",
    "so our alternate model is regular variation on @xmath383 with index @xmath382 and limit measure which concentrates on @xmath384 and hidden regular variation on @xmath385\\cup [ < \\smallwedge])$ ] with index 3.3 .          for this example of financial returns ,",
    "the state space is @xmath386 and for the hrv property we could try deleting @xmath387\\subset { \\mathbb{r}}_+^2 $ ] in the first quadrant and @xmath388 \\subset ( -\\infty,0)^2 $ ] in the third quadrant . for illustration ,",
    "we concentrate on deleting only a wedge from the first quadrant and seeking hrv with points above the upper boundary of @xmath387 $ ] .",
    "this is done partly because there is no guarantee that hrv will hold globally .",
    "the data consists of closing daily prices of exxon ( xom ) and chevron ( cvx ) from january 2 , 1998 to august 9 , 2013 . for each variable",
    "we calculate daily returns for each company called ( exxonr , chevronr ) .",
    "the length of the return vector is 3925 .",
    "one expects strong dependence from two big companies engaged in similar economic activities and this is shown in the raw scatter plot of the variables in figure [ fig : scatter ] .",
    "the four tails of the variables ( @xmath389exxonr , @xmath389chevronr ) are quite similar . based on analyses ( not shown ) using the qq estimator , hill and althill plots , ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) we estimate    l.45     the marginal tail indices @xmath390 in all four cases .",
    "since the tails are estimated to have the same @xmath68 , we did not attempt to standardize the variables to @xmath391 as is often done by either the power method or the ranks transform .    to understand the dependence structure of the variables ( exxonr , chevronr ) , we make a diamond plot of the data .",
    "we do the mapping after thresholding the data at various values determined by @xmath210 , the number of order statistics of the norms @xmath392 .",
    "this is the two - tail empirical equivalent to using the @xmath48 norm . after experimenting with thresholds , we settled on @xmath393 which in the first quadrant produced a range of @xmath394 equal to @xmath395 we finalized our estimate of the support of the limit angular measure , by using the 10% and 90% quantiles of the values of @xmath256 as @xmath396",
    "this corresponds to slope estimates for @xmath40 $ ] of @xmath397 .",
    "the strong asymptotic dependence among the marginals is evident from the diamond plot and histogram of @xmath256 in figure .",
    "there is little evidence that a large positive change in one variable is accompanied by a large negative change in the other as shown by the lack of points in the second and fourth quadrants in figure [ fig : oil_diamond ] .",
    "there is no visual evidence supporting the hypothesis of full asymptotic dependence .",

    "points to the left of this perpendicular would be closer to @xmath388 $ ] rather than @xmath387 $ ] and are excluded .",
    "there are 706 points satisfying the three conditions ; we call these points _ oilreturns2013gr_. these are plotted in figure [ fig : niceoilypts ] . the angle between the two rays of biggest slope is 90 degrees .",

    "this produces the hillish plots given in figure [ fig : hillisposret ] .",
    "both figures [ fig : csreturnsgr ] and [ fig : hillisposret ] are encouraging .",
    "whenever the limit measure of multivariate regular variation concentrates on a cone smaller than the full state space , there is the potential for seeking hidden regular variation .",
    "this idea has been most often applied to the case of asymptotic independence where the limit measure concentrates on the axes .",
    "here we have shown the idea is also applicable when the limit measure concentrates on the diagonal or a narrow cone such as @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "without hidden regular variation , asymptotic independence causes analysts to miss risk contagion .",
    "analogously , when the limit measure concentrates on the diagonal , analysis would estimate the probability of a risk region @xmath406 to be zero when in fact , hidden regular variation would yield a small but non - zero probability .",

    ", much work remains to be done on implementation .",
    "both our network data which is node based and our returns data is nothing like independent replicated data . also , our methods for estimating the support of the angular measure @xmath407 are primitive at best .",
