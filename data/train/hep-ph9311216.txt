    "it is believed that the perturbative qcd is applicable in the deconfined phase at large enough temperatures @xmath2 , where the effective coupling constant @xmath3 is small [ 1 ] , while at small @xmath2 ( in the confined phase ) the nonperturbative effects instead are most important .",
    "however even at large t the physics is not that simple : some effects , like screening ( electric gluon mass ) , need a resummation of the perturbative series [ 2 ] , while the effects connected with the magnetic gluon mass demonstrate the infrared divergence of the series [ 3 ] .",
    "there is a substantial amount of data from lattice calculations in the deconfined phase , which can be explained only by nonperturbative effects ( see discussion below in section 6 ) .",
    "therefore one can assume that nonperturbative effects are of vital importance both for small and large @xmath2 and should be taken into account before any dynamical perturbative scheme is applied .",
    "we suggest to use for this purpose the background field formalism [ 4 ] , in connection with the cluster expansion for background fields [ 5 ] and the feynman - schwinger representation ( fsr ) [ 6 ] for the green s function .",
    "this method has been used successfully for qcd at @xmath4 and it contains confinement as an essential ingredient , appearing through the area law of wilson loops in fsr .    it is a purpose of this paper to apply the method to the case of @xmath0 by proper modifications of fsr and the background field method ( bfm ) . for this purpose",
    "we write in section 2 the familiar bfm expressions for the free energy with the only important new element : we do not consider the background field as classical ( as it is usually done ) but rather make an average over an ensemble of background fields , so that the latter enter final expressions for the free energy in the form of gauge - invariant correlators .    as a consequence the simple loop diagram the leading term @xmath5 of the usual perturbation theory  becomes a set of diagrams representing multiple loops interacting via nonperturbative correlators .",
    "this is done in section 3 for gluons and in section 4 for quarks .",
    "the important new element there is a new form of fsr for a gluon or a quark green s function appropriate for @xmath0 : it contains a path integral winding on a torus which compactifies the fourth euclidean direction .",
    "this enables us to compute gauge - invariant green s function for hadrons and response functions for @xmath0 .",
    "higher order amplitudes are discussed in section 5 . here",
    "the behaviour of the qcd coupling constant @xmath6 in strong background field at all distances is exploited [ 7 ] .    in section 6",
    "we identify the leading contributions to the free energy in the limit when @xmath7 and @xmath6 is small .",
    "it is gratifying that the phase transition of the first order occurs already in this oversimplifying case and the resulting transition temperature @xmath8 does not depend on @xmath1 when @xmath1 is large .",
    "clearly the mechanism of the phase transition is the evaporation of a part of the gluonic condensate into a gas of almost free gluons [ 8 ] .",
    "the predicted value of @xmath8 agrees well with monte carlo calculations both in the case of gluodynamics [ 9 ] and in the case of qcd [ 10 ] for different number of flavours .    in conclusion",
    "possible prospectives of the proposed method are outlined .",
    "we start with standard formulas of the background field formalism [ 4 ] generalized to the case of nonzero temperature .",
    "we assume that the gluonic field @xmath9 can be split into the background field @xmath10 and the quantum field @xmath11 @xmath12 both satisfying periodic boundary conditions @xmath13    where @xmath14 is an integer and @xmath15 .",
    "the partition function can be written as @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes all set of fields @xmath19 is a normalization constant , and the sign @xmath20 means some averaging over ( nonperturbative ) background fields @xmath10 , the exact form of this averaging is not needed for our purposes .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath21 where @xmath22    here @xmath23 are ghost fields , @xmath24- gauge  fixing constant , @xmath25 contains 3gluon and 4gluon vertices , and we keep the most general background field @xmath10 , not satisfying classical equations , hence the the appearence of @xmath26 .",
    "the inverse gluon propagator in the background gauge is @xmath27 where @xmath28    we cosider first the case of pure gluodinamics , @xmath29 .",

    "( 7 ) is a perturbative sum in powers of @xmath34 , arising from expansion in @xmath35 .    in what follows",
    "we shall discuss the feynman graphs for the free energy @xmath36 connected to @xmath37 via @xmath38    as will be seen , the lowest order graphs already contain a nontrivial dynamical mechanism for the deconfinement transition , and those will be considered in the next section .",
    "to the lowest order in @xmath39 ( and keeping all dependence on @xmath31 explicitly ) one has @xmath40 where using ( 7 ) @xmath41 can be written as @xmath42    in ( 10 ) @xmath43 implies summing over all variables ( lorentz and color indices and coordinates ) , @xmath44 is a regularizing factor , one can use also the pauli - villars form for @xmath45 .",
    "graphically the first term on the r.h.s . of ( 10 ) is shown in fig.1 and is a gluon loop in the background field , the second term is a ghost loop , shown in fig.2 .",

    "we start with the thermal ghost propagator and write the fsr for it [ 6 ] @xmath49    here @xmath50 is the parallel transporter in the adjoint representation along the trajectory of the ghost : @xmath51 also @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a path integration with boundary conditions imbedded ( this is marked by the subscript @xmath54 ) and with all possible windings in the euclidean temporal direction .    one can write it explicitly as @xmath55 here @xmath56 .    one can check that in the free case , @xmath57 , eq.(12 ) reduces to well - known form of the free propagator @xmath58    with @xmath59    using the poisson summation formula @xmath60 one finally gets the jackiw - templeton s form [ 1,2 ] @xmath61    note that as expected the propagator ( 12),(17 ) corresponds to a sum of ghost paths with all ppossible windings around the torus .",
    "the momentum integration in ( 14 ) asserts that the sum of all infinitesimal `` walks '' @xmath62 should be equal to the distance @xmath63 modulo @xmath14 windings in the conpactified fourth coordinate .",
    "for the gluon propagator in the backgrounvd gauge we obtain similarly to ( 12 ) @xmath64 where @xmath65 and the operators @xmath66 are used to order insertions of @xmath67 on the trajectory of the gluon [ 11,12 ] .",
    "now we come back to the first term in ( 11 ) , @xmath48 , which can be represented with the help of ( 12 ) and ( 18 ) as @xmath68\\ ] ] where the sign @xmath69 implies summation over lorentz and color indices .    in the appendix 1",
    "we show that eq.(20 ) yields for @xmath70 the usual result of the free gluon gas : @xmath71    as a next example we consider the case of nonzero component @xmath72 , while @xmath73 .",
    "we also neglect for simplicity the difference between @xmath74 and @xmath50 , i.e. we put @xmath75 .",
    "actually the interactions of @xmath67 represent the interaction of the gluon spin with the background field [ 11 , 12 ] and gives rise to short - range correlations ( in the confining phase it also yields spin - orbit interaction , the nonperturbative part of which , the thomas precession , is long range , @xmath76 ) with the notation @xmath77 one obtains from ( 20 ) @xmath78    in the case @xmath79 we come back to the free case , eq.(21 ) , since @xmath80 the expression ( 24 ) for a constant field @xmath72 yields the well - known result @xmath81 where @xmath82 means trace over color indices .    one can notice in ( 26 ) , ( 24 ) that in general the presence of field @xmath72(or @xmath83 ) descreases the modulus of @xmath84 , i.e. is not advantageous from the point of view of the minimum of @xmath84 .",
    "thus @xmath85 in the deconfined regime represents a loop contribution of the gluon gas in the background field .",
    "now we turn to the confining regime and again calculate @xmath48 .",
    "it is convenient to choose another point @xmath86 on the loop in addition to the initial point @xmath87 , as shown in fig.3 and to write @xmath48 as @xmath88 where we have introduced the area law for the closed contour average @xmath89 it is important at this point to stress that in the confining regime the total contour @xmath90 shown in fig.4 , made by trajectories @xmath91 and @xmath92 in ( 27 ) , should be a closed contour , or in other words , in the representation @xmath93 one should choose @xmath94 in this case both trajectories @xmath91 and @xmath95 are winding in the same way on the torus and the minimal surface @xmath96 lies on the surface of the torus , winding around it @xmath14 times . in the case",
    "@xmath97 there appear a piece of length @xmath98 where a gluon is winding and contributing an infinite amount to the free energy ( since we assume that the free energy of an isolated quark or gluon is ininite ) .",
    "thus for @xmath99 one can integrate in ( 27 ) , ( 29 ) over @xmath100 as follows ( note that @xmath101 changes in the limits @xmath102 $ ] ) @xmath103= ( 2\\pi)^4 \\delta^4(p+p')\\ ] ] we obtain for @xmath48 @xmath104 where we have introduced @xmath105 one can notice that temperature enters only as a factor @xmath106 in ( 32 ) and it is cancelled in the free energy @xmath107 one can also rewrite @xmath108 through the two - gluon green s function + @xmath109 , where gluons start at the point @xmath110 and meet at the point @xmath87 : @xmath111 in the free case it is equal to @xmath112 .",
    "note however that this result coincides with the loop diagram for @xmath4 , which is entirely absorbed by the subtraction constant in calculating ( 21 ) .    in case of confinement one obtains instead @xmath113 where @xmath114 are wavefunction at origin and glueball mass respectively .    in any case our result for the gluon loop with confinement , eq.(34 ) , does not depend on temperature and should be included in the value of the free energy for zero temperature , which as we shall argue below is given by the scale anomaly [ 14 ] , i.e. by the gluonic condensate .    note that physically this correspondence is quite understandable , since the gluon loop contributimon ( 34 ) is expressed through the two - gluon bound state at the total momentum zero , i.e. through the condensate of bound gluon - gluon pairs ( glueballs ) , and the latter is most generally given by the gluonic condensate @xmath115 via the scale anomaly expression .",
    "integrating over quark fields in ( 3 ) is done trivially and leads to the following additional factor in ( 7 ) @xmath116 where we have used the symmetry property of eigenvalues of @xmath117 in the lowest approximation we omit @xmath11 in ( 37 ) and write the free energy contribution @xmath41 similary to the gluon contribution ( 9 - 10 ) as @xmath118 where the sign @xmath43 has the same meaning as in ( 10 ) and @xmath119 our aim now is to exploit the fsr to represent ( 38 ) in a form of the path integral , as it was done for gluons in ( 14 ) . the equivalent form for quarks must implement the antisymmetric boundary conditions pertinent to fermions .",
    "it is easy to understand that the correct form for quark is @xmath120 where @xmath121 @xmath122    one can easily check that in the case @xmath123 one is recovering the well - known expression for the free quark gas @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the number of flavors .",
    "the derivation of ( 42 ) starting from the path - integral form(40 ) is done similarly to the gluon case given in the appendix 1 .",
    "the loop @xmath126 in ( 40 ) corresponds to @xmath14 windings in the fourth direction . above the deconfinement transition temperature @xmath8",
    "one can visualize in ( 40 ) the appearance of the factor @xmath127 ( note the absence of the dash sign in ( 43 ) as compared to ( 22 ) implying that in ( 43 ) @xmath128 is taken in the fundamental representation ) .",
    "for the constant field @xmath128 and @xmath129 one obtains @xmath130    this result coincides with the obtained in the literature [ 13 ] .",
    "we unify under this title two different types of contributions : i ) higher order cumulants from the cluster expansion ( 11 ) for the determinantal term ( 9 ) ; ii ) terms of the higher order in @xmath6 , appearing in the perturbative expansion ( 7 ) .",
    "we discuss first the terms i ) .",
    "a generic case is given by the quadratic cumulant @xmath131 which can be written as ( we neglect the gluon spin terms ) @xmath132 @xmath133 where @xmath50 is defined in ( 13 ) .",
    "the cumulant in the integral ( 45 ) corresponds to the interaction between two gluon loops , each loop being a gauge - invariant object .",
    "hence the interaction of the loops , given by the cumulant , is suppressed as @xmath134 both in the confining and nonconfining regimes(as compared to the contribution @xmath48 in ( 11 ) ) .    in the confining regime",
    "two gluons form a bound state  a glueball .",
    "one can choose the initial glueball state connecting the loops @xmath135 and @xmath136 by the stright line at some fixed @xmath137 , and then ( 45 ) can be rewritten as @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are central and relative coordinates of two gluons defined in accordance with ( 33 ) .",
    "the resulting integrals in ( 46 ) are similar to those in ( 32 ) with one essential difference ; in ( 32 ) the integration over all @xmath141 as in ( 31 ) is performed leading to the total momentum of two gluons @xmath142 .",
    "in contrast to that in ( 46 ) the initial and final central point @xmath139 is the same and therefore all values of total momentum are possible as in the one  gluon case , see ( 15 ) and appendix 1 .    as a result",
    "one obtains the temperature dependence and the final result ( see appendix b for details ) is the free energy of the glueball state [ 15 ] @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the glueball mass in the glueball state @xmath145 .",
    "note that ( 47 ) is @xmath146 since it is a color singlet contribution , in contrast to the gluon contribution ( 21 ) .    in the same way one can consider the next irreducible average , @xmath147 .",
    "the contribution is again a color singlet , corresponds to the three - gluon glueball in the confining regime and is of the order @xmath146 .",
    "the same features are common to higher order cumulants .    in a similar manner one can study the quark contributions to @xmath148 . in this case one",
    "has to replace in ( 45 ) the adjoint parallel transporters @xmath149 by the fundamental ones and use the fermion boundary conditions in @xmath53 as in ( 41 ) . in the confining regime one",
    "obtains the meson contribution to the free energy which has the same form as in ( 47 ) .",
    "it is of the order of @xmath150 .",
    "the largest contribution at small temperatures , @xmath151 comes from the pion gas , where neglecting the pion mass we have @xmath152 one should note , that in the set i ) introduced above the gluons interact whith each other via nonperturbative field @xmath10 , which can be exemplified by the correlators @xmath153 etc .",
    "in contrast to that in the set ii ) all perturbative exchanges are taken into account .",
    "these are proportional to @xmath34 and in the usual treatment @xmath154 is small at large temperature while it may diverge as @xmath155 [ 1 ] @xmath156    in the strong background field however one has an additional scale parameter @xmath157 which defines dynamics both at small and large distances and temperatures .",
    "one can show that when @xmath158 this scale defines the value of the coupling constant @xmath159 and @xmath159 remains small even when @xmath2 tends to zero [ 7 ] .",
    "therefore one may hope that the perturbative terms ( set ii ) ) which yield relatively small contribution ( @xmath160 at @xmath161 , remain of the same order at all temperatures .",
    "in this section we estimate the deconfinement temperature keeping only leading terms in both phases  confining and deconfining .",
    "results given below have been published in a short form in [ 8 ] .",
    "we start with the zero temperature and note that the @xmath163 energy density @xmath164 is connected via the scale anomaly [ 14 ] to the gluonic condensate [ 16 ] ( we neglect the quark masses since only light quarks are important at low temperatures ) @xmath165    one can associate with @xmath164 the zero  temperature limit of the free ( helmholtz ) energy @xmath166 and write @xmath167 at nonzero temperature as @xmath168 where @xmath169 is to be computed using the formulas ( 8) and subsequent ones",
    ". since @xmath169 is regularized by subtracting the zero - temperature limit @xmath170 and all divergencies are present in the latter term , eq.(51 ) is a definition of the regularized limit @xmath166 where only @xmath163 contribution in the gluonic condensate is present .",
    "a check of correctness of our normalization of @xmath166 is given by the computation of the leading contribution in section 3 .    there the perturbative contribution ( 21 ) goes to zero as @xmath171 in accordance with our prescription that perturbative contributions are normalized to vanish at @xmath171 .",
    "if however one takes into account the confining background , one gets for @xmath171 a nonzero contribution ( 34 ) , which is exactly due to a pair of gluons connected by the adjoint string ( 28 ) and with zero total momentum ( see ( 31 ) ) .",
    "this is exactly the contribution which one expects from a gluon pair forming a condensate .",
    "the low  temperature phase consists of the gluonic condensate ( 50 ) , glueballs ( 47 ) , mesons ( we keep only the pion ( 48 ) ) and their interacting conglomerates : @xmath172 here the first term is the leading in @xmath1 ; it grows as @xmath173 [ 17 ] , while the ideal gas of glueballs and mesons contributes @xmath146 .",
    "note that the interaction between white objects is suppressed at @xmath174 [ 18 ] and is presented in ( 52 ) by the last term .",
    "the high  temperature phase is belived to be the gas of quarks and gluons , interacting perturbatively [ 1,2 ] .",
    "we shall now argue that i ) there is at @xmath175 another component of the phase , namely a part of the gluonic condensate , which has not evaporated during the phase transition ; ii ) there is a @xmath163 interaction between quarks and gluons which is important in some situations .",
    "to start we remind that the @xmath163 interaction is governed by the correlators [ 6 ] @xmath176>\\ ] ] which at @xmath4 contain two independent lorentz structures with scalar coefficients @xmath177 and",
    "@xmath178 [ 5,6 ] @xmath179 d_1(u)\\ ] ] at @xmath0 the lorentz invariance is broken and one obtains two independent correlators for electric and magnetic fields respectively [ 19 ] @xmath180 d^{(e)}_1 ( u)\\ ] ] @xmath181 d^{b}_1 ( u)\\ ] ]    for the gluon condensate one must put @xmath182 in ( 54 - 55 ) with the result @xmath183 out of four functions in ( 56 ) only one , @xmath184 , is connected to the confinement , since the string tension @xmath185 is expressed through it [ 5,6 ] @xmath186 where dots imply contributions of higher - order cumulants .",
    "note that the integral ( 58 ) is confined to the region @xmath187 , since @xmath184 falls off exponentially outside .",
    "the value of @xmath188  the gluonic correlation length  is the order of @xmath189 [ 20 ] .    therefore for the temperatures @xmath190 the periodicity in the fourth direction does not change @xmath185 significantly , and the deconfinement occurs when @xmath184 disappears at some @xmath191 together with @xmath185 .",
    "there is no reason why @xmath192 disappear at @xmath191 or at @xmath193 .",
    "moreover , there is evidence [ 21 ] that @xmath194 , which defines the area law of the spacial wilson loops , should be nonzero at @xmath175 .",
    "additional evidence comes from the hadronic screening lengths [ 22 ] , also implying the confining dynamics in the spacial directions ( we refer the reader to [ 9,19 ] for more discussion of this point ) .",
    "thus we can assume that only @xmath184 disappears at @xmath191 .",
    "how gluonic condensate changes with temperature ?",
    "the answer comes from lattice calculations [ 23 ] and shows that @xmath195 is rather stable and only a part of it disappears near @xmath191 .",
    "this is understandable from the theoretical point of view , since the natural scale of @xmath196 is given by the lowest glueball mass approximately equal to the mass of the dilaton [ 24 ] which is of the order of @xmath197 , and therefore @xmath196 should not strongly change in the range @xmath198 .",
    "thus we come to the following model for high  temperature phase : @xmath199 where @xmath200    since @xmath201 enters the @xmath163 tensor force of quarkonia [ 11 ] one can make some estimate of @xmath202 the lattice calculations [ 20 ] at @xmath4 yield @xmath203 .",
    "therefore it seems reasonable to neglect @xmath204 and @xmath205 ( note that @xmath206 at @xmath4 ) and having in mind that @xmath207 at @xmath4 , one has an estimate @xmath208 as another option with @xmath209 , one can choose @xmath210 .",
    "we have neglected in ( 59 ) i ) higher order terms in @xmath34 , ii ) higher order cumulants @xmath211 with @xmath212 and iii ) the influence of the term @xmath213 ( 24 ) and ( 43 ) . as we discussed above",

    "note also , that studies of @xmath167 for constant @xmath128 [ 25 ] seem to support our conclusion ( in lowest orders graphs ) .",
    "of course our argument here is very qualitative and can be used only for a rough estimate of @xmath8 . a more detailed study of the role of @xmath213 is now in progress [ 26 ] .",
    "we now can plot both curves @xmath221 ( 59 ) , @xmath222 ( 52 ) or rather the pressure @xmath223 as a function of temperature and use again the principle of minimal @xmath167 ( maximal @xmath224 ) .",
    "one can see in fig.4 that there exists indeed some critical temperature @xmath191 and the system prefers to be in the low phase at @xmath225 and in the high phase at @xmath175 .",
    "the transition is of the first order , and @xmath8 can be computed equalizing ( 59 ) and ( 52 )    in the leading order @xmath226 one obtains : @xmath227    we note that @xmath8 is @xmath146 which is reasonable since strong interactions ( except for baryons ) have finite limit both in masses and the range of interaction when @xmath228 . with the standard value [ 16 ] .",

    "we take into account the quark contribution and still disregard all meson and glueball contributions ( as well as nonideal gas corrections for gluons and quarks ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath235    for the choice ( 61 ) and @xmath236 we have @xmath237 while for @xmath238 we have @xmath239 , which agrees well with recent lattice calculations [ 9,10 ] @xmath240(lattice)=@xmath241 and @xmath242 respectively .",
    "we have started in the paper the background field formalism for @xmath0 with the purpose to take into account the np contributions in a systematic way .",
    "the perturbation theory was formulated where expansion is of two different kinds : the cluster expansion for nonperturbative interaction and the usual expansion in powers of the coupling constant for perturbative quarks and gluons in the strong np background .",

    "this will be discussed in detail in a subsequent paper .",
    "note added : after the original version of this manuscript has been published as a preprint [ 27 ] , the author became aware of a similar estimate of @xmath8 in [ 28 ] , where it was assumed that no nonperturbative configurations are present for @xmath175 in the high temperature phase .",
