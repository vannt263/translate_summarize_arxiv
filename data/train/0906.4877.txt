    "dark solitons are one - dimensional phase defects that play an important role in nonlinear transport .",
    "they have been observed experimentally in nonlinear optics @xcite , shallow liquids @xcite , magnetic films @xcite and , most recently , ultra - cold atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite . in the latter case matter - wave dark solitons consist of a localised dip in the atomic density and a phase slip , and",
    "are supported by repulsive atomic interactions .",
    "dark solitons are prone to several dissipation mechanisms .",
    "two such mechanisms are thermal dissipation @xcite and the snake instability whereby the soliton decays into vortex rings @xcite .",
    "although numerous initial experiments showed such instabilities to severely limit the soliton lifetime @xcite , they can nonetheless be heavily suppressed at ultracold temperatures and in highly - elongated trap geometries .",
    "indeed , such techniques have led to the recent generation of long - lived dark solitons that made many complete oscillations in the trapped condensate @xcite .",
    "matter wave dark solitons are also subject to an instability to acceleration through an inhomogeneous system @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that this instability is a generic occurrence for dark solitons in trapped atomic becs .",
    "furthermore , we will show that , under appropriately engineered conditions , this can become the dominant decay mechanism and is within reach of being detected by current experiments .",
    "condensate dynamics at zero temperature obey a nonlinear wave equation known as the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite . in one - dimension and under a homogeneous potential ,",
    "a dark soliton is an exact and integrable solution of this equation .",
    "the presence of an inhomogeneous potential ( which is relevant in practically all bec experiments ) simultaneously accelerates the soliton and breaks this integrability , rendering it unstable and leading to the emission of sound waves @xcite . providing",
    "the potential is slowly varying the decay of the soliton energy @xmath0 follows a simple acceleration - squared law @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the soliton position and @xmath3 is a coefficient that typically depends weakly on the local density and soliton speed .",
    "an analogous instability arises for dark solitons in nonlinear optics , induced by modifications in the optical nonlinearity , and led to the original derivation of the above power law @xcite .",
    "importantly , for the common case of harmonic trapping , dark solitons have been predicted to undergo conservative dynamics in the zero temperature and one - dimensional limit @xcite , oscillating back and forth in the trap .",
    "this appears to oppose the prediction of instability under acceleration .",
    "this anomaly can be reconciled by the fact that in a harmonic trap continuous reabsorption of the emitted sound stabilises the soliton against decay @xcite .",
    "the importance of soliton - sound interactions was reinforced in @xcite , where it was shown that energy could be pumped into a dark soliton by driving a sound field in the condensate .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar instability arises for a vortex accelerating in a trapped bec and that they too appear to be stabilised within harmonic traps @xcite .",
    "harmonic traps appear to be a special case .",
    "previous results indicate that deviations from harmonic trapping tend to induce dissipation of the soliton .",
    "such instability has been observed , for example , for a dark soliton in modified harmonic traps @xcite , interacting with localised barriers @xcite , and moving through an optical lattice @xcite and disordered potential @xcite .",
    "motivated by this effect we study the soliton dynamics under several pertinent forms of confining potential .",
    "crucially , we demonstrate that the presence of anharmonicities can destroy the soliton - sound equilibrium and lead to net decay of the soliton . this decay can be rapid and within current experimental soliton lifetimes , provided the gas is kept at a relatively low temperature .",
    "importantly , this paper demonstrates that the experimental observation of this decay mechanism is within reach of current long - lived soliton experiments @xcite .",

    "for example , for @xmath72 the soliton will decay within the experimental lifetime provided the trap depth does not exceed @xmath132 .",
    "these results suggest that with only slight modifications this decay channel will dominate the experiment and cause the soliton to decay within the experimental timescale .",
    "the soliton dynamics are also very sensitive to the trap depth @xmath77 , a feature which also lends itself to experimental detection . the detectable signature for the decay",
    "would be provided by the considerable anti - damping of the soliton that accompanies the decay , which could be probed either in expansion images @xcite or even in situ @xcite .",
    "( solid line ) , @xmath96 ( dotted line ) and @xmath125 ( grey line ) . following the experimental observations we employ an initial soliton speed of @xmath116 .",
    "( b ) decay time in the experimental system as a function of the gaussian trap depth @xmath77 .",
    "initial soliton speeds of @xmath116 ( circles ) and @xmath72 ( crosses ) are presented .",
    "the dashed line indicates the maximum soliton lifetime reported in the experiment.,width=321 ]      we will also briefly discuss the recent soliton experiment by weller _",
    "two separated condensates were initially formed in a double trap potential .",
    "the double trap potential is formed by the combination of an elongated harmonic trap and one period of a one - dimensional optical lattice potential . upon removal of the optical lattice",
    "the condensate underwent nonlinear interference which resulted in the production of dark solitons .",
    "these solitons were then observed to make up to @xmath133 oscillations in the system .",
    "although the solitons are typically produced in pairs we expect our predictions to hold for multiple solitons .",
    "the final trap potential is harmonic and so we do not expect any net decay of the solitons due to acceleration - induced sound emission . however , if the optical lattice potential were instead maintained at some low amplitude following the creation of the dark solitons , then we anticipate that soliton decay would occur .",
    "we previously considered the dynamics of a dark soliton in a harmonic trap featuring an optical lattice potential @xcite .",
    "the optical lattice potential was assumed to be weak ( amplitude less than the chemical potential ) such that the soliton could traverse the lattice site / s and thereby undergo acceleration - induced sound emission .",
    "provided the lattice spacing @xmath134 was in the range @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the healing length and @xmath137 is the condensate length , the soliton consistently underwent decay .",
    "( for @xmath138 the density perturbations due to the optical lattice become smeared out while for @xmath139 the trap reduces to being effectively harmonic . )",
    "this is consistent with the results presented in this paper : the optical lattice introduces anharmonicities that prevent complete sound reabsorption .",
    "the ensuing decay could be rapid , with complete decay occurring as quickly as within one trap period in certain cases . in the experiment of weller _",
    "_ @xcite the lattice spacing is approximately @xmath137 , and so we expect that the presence of the lattice can indeed induce soliton decay .",
    "this suggestion is similar to an earlier prediction @xcite where we showed that a single gaussian barrier within a harmonic trap could lead to soliton decay .",
    "moreover , decay in the experiment of @xcite could be further enhanced by decreasing the periodicity of the proposed optical lattice ; following previous results @xcite we would expect the quickest decay when @xmath140 .",
    "we have examined the zero - temperature , mean - field dynamics of dark solitons in atomic bose - einstein condensates under harmonic and anharmonic trapping .",
    "such inhomogeneous potentials generally accelerate the soliton and induce an instability whereby the soliton radiates sound waves . in the absence of sound reabsorption the power radiated by the soliton is proportional to its acceleration squared .",
    "however , due to the finite - size of becs , the sound waves remain in the system and generally re - interact with the soliton .",
    "the ensuing dynamics between the soliton and sound waves are crucially dependent on the form of the trapping potential .    under harmonic trapping no net decay of the soliton",
    "is observed , despite the local instability of the soliton .",
    "the isochronicity of the harmonic trap leads to the creation of a dynamical equilibrium between the soliton and the emitted sound waves which prevents net soliton decay .",
    "we note that the inclusion of an additional harmonic frequency to the system , e.g. , by considering an asymmetric harmonic trap ( different trap frequencies for @xmath141 and @xmath142 ) , maintains the stability of the soliton .",
    "decay of the soliton in the harmonic trap can be induced , but involves removal of some of the emitted sound , e.g. by introducing a finite cut - off to the harmonic trap .    in a gaussian trap decay",
    "can occur without the removal of the emitted sound even at zero temperature .",
    "this is possible because the soliton - sound equilibrium is broken by the anharmonicity of the trap . in accord with this",
    "the decay is strongly dependent on the anharmonicity experienced by the soliton .",
    "the soliton decay is accompanied by the growth of short wavelengths in the sound field .",
    "quartic trapping also leads to soliton decay .",
    "furthermore , several existing studies have added some form of anharmonic perturbation to the harmonic trap and observed soliton decay , e.g. under the addition of an optical lattice @xcite , a localised barrier @xcite and a disordered potential @xcite , in concurrence with our findings .",
    "soliton decay can be rapid .",
    "for example , in the gaussian trap we have observed a soliton ( with initial speed @xmath71 , where @xmath42 is the speed of sound ) disappear into the sound field after only five oscillations in the trap .",
    "given that solitons have recently been stabilised for over @xmath133 trap oscillations @xcite it is clear that acceleration - induced soliton decay can dominate over the more well - known dissipation mechanisms ( thermal dissipation and the snake instability ) .",
    "for the experiment of becker et al .",
    "@xcite , which was conducted in a gaussian trap , our results suggest that the soliton should completely decay within the experimental lifetime provided a slightly shallower gaussian trap or a faster soliton is employed .",
    "note that the trap depth is readily varied through the intensity of the laser beam that forms the trap , while the soliton speed can be varied by adjusting the degree of phase imprinting .",
    "furthermore , for the recent experiment of weller _ et al . _",
    "@xcite we suggest that if a weak optical lattice is maintained during soliton propagation it may lead to significant soliton decay .",
    "soliton decay can be detected by the increase in the soliton oscillation amplitude measured either in successive absorption images or in situ , with the accompanying growth of the sound field providing further indication of this effect .",
    "it is interesting to note that the instability to acceleration that underpins this decay channel has also been predicted for vortical excitations in atomic becs , including single vortices @xcite , corotating vortex pairs @xcite and two - dimensional vortex - antivortex pairs @xcite .",
    "hybrid dark soliton / vortex rings excitations that have recently been observed @xcite may also be expected to undergo an instability to acceleration .",
    "as such the decay channel discussed here may extend well beyond dark solitons .",
    "we acknowledge the uk epsrc ( ngp / npp / csa ) and the canadian government ( ngp ) for support .",
    "we thank a. m. martin , d. h. j. odell , d. pelinovsky and k. sengstock for discussions .",
    "although the soliton energy technically extends up to the boundary of the system it is useful to have a _ local _ measurement of the soliton energy . we perform this by numerically evaluating the energy in a local region about the soliton centre . in trapped systems this will typically contain contributions from other excitations , e.g. sound waves . however , this contribution is typically very small .",
    "note that from an experimental point of view it is precisely the behaviour of this soliton region , including local excitations , which is probed experimentally .",
    "the energy density of the condensate is given by the energy functional , @xmath143=\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left|\\nabla\\psi\\right|^2+v_{\\rm ext}\\left|\\psi\\right|^2+\\frac{g}{2}\\left|\\psi\\right|^4.\\label{eqn : func}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we define our soliton energy @xmath0 to be , @xmath144 { \\rm d } z- \\int_{z_{\\rm s}-z_{\\rm int}}^{z_{\\rm s}+z_{\\rm int } } \\varepsilon[\\sqrt{n_{\\rm ti } } ] { \\rm d}z .",
    "\\label{eqn : soliton_energy}\\ ] ] here @xmath145 defines the extent of the integration region .",
    "note that we subtract off the corresponding energy of the condensate background density ( second term ) .",
    "figures [ soliton_energy](a ) and ( b ) present the integrated soliton energy as a function of @xmath145 for various soliton speeds and background densities , respectively . for simplicity",
    "we consider an infinite system with @xmath146 . for large enough @xmath145",
    "we observe convergence to the analytic soliton energy of eq .",
    "[ eqn : sol_energy ] ( dashed lines ) .",
    "larger @xmath145 is required for convergence for faster solitons and/or lower densities , due to the increased soliton width . however , for the speeds and densities considered here , the integrated energy is virtually indistinguishable from the analytic prediction for @xmath147 , which is employed in this work .",
