    "lattice qcd is fighting on several fronts in order to obtain results relevant to the physics of hadrons in the continuum : one wants to control the effects ( a ) of the finite size of the lattice , ( b ) of the non - zero lattice spacing @xmath0 , and ( c ) of too large quark masses . for small quark masses",
    "monte carlo calculations suffer from a slowing down roughly proportional to @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "this has so far prevented simulations with light wilson quarks of realistic masses .",
    "for the extrapolation of the numerical results to small values of up- and down - quark masses , chiral perturbation theory can be employed .",
    "it amounts to an expansion around the chiral limit at vanishing quark masses .",
    "the low energy parameters of chiral perturbation theory , the _ gasser - leutwyler coefficients _ , can in turn be determined by numerical simulations of lattice qcd , see @xcite for a review .      for simplicity",
    "we consider qcd with @xmath3 flavours of degenerate light quarks , @xmath4 , in the following .",
    "consider a `` twisted '' quark mass matrix ( @xmath5 acts in flavour space ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 . in the continuum",
    "the angle @xmath8 can be removed by a chiral rotation @xmath9 , so that physics does not depend on @xmath8 . on the lattice ,",
    "however , chiral symmetry is broken even for massless qcd , and there is a dependence on @xmath8 due to lattice artifacts .",
    "twisted mass lattice qcd has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "recently it has been advocated to employ a chirally twisted quark mass matrix for wilson fermions in order to improve the efficiency of qcd simulations due to full @xmath10 improvement occurring for @xmath11 @xcite .      the @xmath12 chiral symmetry of massless qcd is spontaneously broken to @xmath13 , and in addition explicitly broken by non - vanishing quark masses .",
    "for @xmath3 the corresponding pseudo - goldstone bosons are the pions @xmath14 .",
    "chiral perturbation theory describes their dynamics by means of a low - energy lagrangian .",
    "it is expressed in terms of the matrix - valued field @xmath15 , which transforms as @xmath16 under chiral transformations @xmath17 .",
    "the leading order effective lagrangian is @xmath18 where the quark masses are contained in the matrix @xmath19 . in higher orders , terms with more fields and/or derivatives",
    "appear , which are multiplied by the gasser - leutwyler coefficients .",
    "chiral perturbation theory can also be applied to qcd on a lattice , see oliver br s talk at this conference .",
    "the fields of the low - energy effective lagrangian are still defined in the continuum , but the lattice artifacts are taken into account by additional terms in @xmath20 proportional to powers of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "physical quantities , like @xmath21 and @xmath22 , appear in double expansions in quark masses ( modified by logarithms ) and in @xmath0 . in leading order",
    "the lattice terms read @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , with a new parameter @xmath25 .",
    "next - to - leading order calculations have been done in @xcite up to @xmath10 and in @xcite up to @xmath26 .",
    "in view of monte carlo calculations in twisted mass lattice qcd , it is desirable to extend chiral perturbation theory to this case .",
    "this has been done in @xcite .",
    "the twisting of the mass term @xmath27 can be shifted to the lattice term by a chiral rotation @xmath28 .    in leading and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) the lagrangian",
    "correspond to the one of @xcite with a twisted lattice term @xmath29 .",
    "spurion analysis shows that the twisting of the mass term does not produce further terms .",
    "the vacuum corresponds to the minimum of @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast to the untwisted case , the minimum of the effective action is not located at vanishing fields , but at a point where @xmath30 , displaying an explicit flavour and parity breaking .",
    "chiral perturbation theory amounts to an expansion around this shifted vacuum .",
    "expansion of @xmath20 in terms of pion fields yields the tree level contribution to the pion propagator .",
    "loop contributions come from the leading order vertices .",
    "new vertices arising from the shift of the vacuum yield contributions at order @xmath31 only . as a result",
    "we obtain + @xmath32 + @xmath33 + @xmath34 + where @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are renormalized chiral parameters and @xmath38 is the renormalization scale .    at order @xmath0 ,",
    "the dependence on the twist angle @xmath8 shows up in factors @xmath39 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this is different in higher orders , where the above mentioned shift in the pion fields introduces new vertices .    in the case of maximal twist ,",
    "@xmath40 , the lattice artifacts vanish to order @xmath0 .",
    "this has been observed for lattice qcd in general in @xcite , and is the basis of the improvement proposal made there .",
    "the second physical quantity we calculated is the pion decay constant @xmath22 , given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the axial current . a one - loop calculation gives + @xmath43 + @xmath44   - ( 1/16\\pi^2 f_0 ^ 2 ) [ ( \\chi_0 + \\rho_0 ) \\ln ( ( \\chi_0 + \\rho_0)/\\lambda^2 ) ] ) .$ ]",
    "partially quenched qcd is an algorithmic approach to the regime of small quark masses .",
    "the monte carlo updates are being made with sea - quarks , which have large enough masses @xmath45 in order to allow a tolerable simulation speed .",
    "on the other hand , quark propagators and related observables are evaluated with smaller valence - quark masses @xmath46 .",
    "chiral perturbation theory has been adopted to the case of partially quenched qcd in @xcite .",
    "combining the approaches mentioned above , it appears attractive to simulate qcd with chirally twisted quark masses in a partially quenched manner . for the theoretical analysis of the data the extension of the results of @xcite to",
    "the partially quenched case has been done in @xcite .    in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory the field @xmath47",
    "is extended to a graded matrix in @xmath48 .",
    "the quark mass matrix is in our case given by @xmath49 .",
    "its twisted counterpart is @xmath50 .",
    "we have calculated the pion masses @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and decay constants @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 at nlo ( one - loop ) including @xmath10 @xcite",
    ". at order @xmath0 the dependence on the twist angle amounts to factors @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "the expressions can be used in the analysis of numerical results from monte carlo calculations and will aid the extrapolation to small quark masses .",
    "an extension of the calculation to order @xmath31 is in progress . for the unquenched case results have been published recently by scorzato @xcite and sharpe and wu @xcite .",
    "a prerequisite to any numerical simulation project is the knowledge of the phase structure of the model under consideration .",
    "where are lines or points of phase transitions and how do physical quantities like particle masses behave near them ?",
    "the phase structure of twisted mass lattice qcd has been discussed in @xcite on the basis of chiral perturbation theory .    for lattice qcd without twist , aoki has proposed the possibility of a phase with spontaneous flavour and parity breaking @xcite .",
    "an analysis of this scenario based on chiral perturbation theory has been made by sharpe and singleton @xcite .",
    "a central role plays the potential @xmath59 contained in the effective lagrangian , where @xmath60 .",
    "it contains parameters @xmath61 for small @xmath62 .",
    "recent monte carlo calculations @xcite at @xmath75 indicate the presence of the normal scenario with a first order line . owing to the associated two - phase coexistence and metastability ,",
    "this represents a problem for numerical simulations and it would be desirable to have the phase transition line as short as possible .",
