    "observational cosmology has yielded several surprises , of which the most perplexing is the discovery of a smooth dark energy ( de ) component which has come to dominate the universe at recent epochs , causing cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "the nature of this component is still a matter of speculation , and a very important challenge for the coming years will be to determine its origin and physical properties .",
    "recently , several groups @xcite have reported positive results for the cross - correlation between the cmb power spectrum and that of different lss surveys , providing further evidence for the existence of de . in this paper",
    ", we shall try and illustrate how such cross - correlation may help in unveiling some of the properties of de , focusing on the observational signatures of a model with a time dependent de equation of state .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the dark energy is in terms of a cosmological constant , with equation of state @xmath0 .",
    "the cosmological constant , however , raises two puzzles of its own .",
    "first , there is a glaring discrepancy between the observed dark energy density @xmath1 and the huge values of the cosmological constant suggested by particle physics models .",
    "second , the observed @xmath1 is comparable to the matter density @xmath2 .",
    "this is the notorious time coincidence problem : why do we happen to live at the epoch when the dark energy starts dominating ?    it has long been suggested that both puzzles may find a natural explanation through anthropic selection effects , in scenarios where @xmath1 is a random variable , taking different values in different parts of the universe .",
    "the proposed selection mechanism is very simple @xcite .",
    "the growth of density fluctuations leading to galaxy formation effectively stops when @xmath1 comes to dominate over the matter density . in regions where @xmath1 is greater",
    ", it will dominate earlier , and thus there will be fewer galaxies ( and therefore fewer observers ) .",
    "a typical observer should then expect to find herself in a region where @xmath1 dominates at about the epoch of galaxy formation ( which is close to the present time ) .",
    "much larger values of @xmath1 would yield no galaxies at all , while much smaller values are unlikely due to the smallness of the corresponding range of @xmath1 , assuming that all values of @xmath1 are _ a priori _ equally likely @xcite .",
    "a simple implementation of this idea is obtained by assuming that the dark energy is due to a scalar field @xmath3 with a very flat potential @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath3 are randomized by quantum fluctuations during inflation , resulting in a variation of @xmath3 with a characteristic scale much greater than the present hubble radius .",
    "galaxy formation is possible only in regions where @xmath4 is in a narrow range near @xmath5 .",
    "one expects that the potential in this range is well approximated by a linear function @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and we have set @xmath8 at @xmath5 . the slope @xmath9 should be sufficiently small , so that the variation of @xmath3 is not fast on the present hubble scale .",
    "quantitatively , this can be expressed as the slow roll condition , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath12 is newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath13 is the present hubble expansion rate .    in models with a single de field , and in the absence of ad - hoc adjustments , it has been argued in @xcite that the slow roll condition ( [ slowroll ] ) is likely to be satisfied by excess , by many orders of magnitude , rather than marginally . in this case , @xmath3 remains nearly constant on the hubble scale , and the effective equation of state for the dark energy is @xmath14 , with a very high accuracy .",
    "however , a different situation may be expected in multi - field models , where the slope of the potential @xmath9 is itself a random variable @xcite ( the role of the field @xmath3 in multi - field models is played by the variable in the direction of @xmath15 in the field space . )",
    "the observed value of the slope may then be influenced by anthropic selection .",
    "a very large slope would cause a big crunch much before any observers can develop .",
    "hence , in cases where the prior distribution favors large @xmath9 , the most probable values of the slope would be the ones for which the slow roll condition ( [ slowroll ] ) is only marginally satisfied @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we thus have some motivation to consider a model where the dark energy is due to a scalar field with a linear potential ( [ linear ] ) and a slope @xmath9 marginally satisfying the slow roll condition ( [ slowroll ] ) .",
    "a marginal value of the slope implies that the big crunch is imminent in about 10 billion years from now .",
    "the model can therefore be called a `` doomsday model '' .",
    "a salient feature of this scenario is that the equation of state of dark energy changes significantly at low redshift , when the correlation between the large scale structure evolution and the cmb temperature anisotropies develop .",
    "hence , we may expect that the analysis of such cross correlation may reveal a time varying equation of state @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the redshift",
    ". this will be the subject of the present paper .",
    "prospective constraints on cosmic doomsday based on future determinations of the dimming of distant supernova were discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the analysis shows that snia observations , in combination with cmb and weak lensing data , have an impressive potential for constraining the equation of state parameter .",
    "however , the constraints reported in @xcite still show a considerable degeneracy amongst models with the same `` average '' @xmath18 ( [ see eq .",
    "( [ average ] ) below ) .",
    "interestingly , as we shall see , the isw - matter cross correlation breaks this degeneracy , offering the possibility of telling a true doomsday model from a model with a constant @xmath19 .",
    "the methods presented here can obviously be used in a more general context , provided that there is significant evolution of @xmath20 at low redshifts .",
    "a rather common assumption in phenomenological studies of dark energy is to consider the simplest case of a constant @xmath20 .",
    "this is partially motivated by degeneracies such as the one we just discussed above , which also occur in the angular spectrum of cmb anisotropies @xcite as well as in the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "the analysis of cmb / lss cross correlations with a constant @xmath20 ( including @xmath21 ) was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we shall drop this assumption , since the variation of @xmath20 with redshift may provide a very exciting clue to the nature of dark energy , as discussed above .    in our calculation",
    "we shall adopt a top - down approach , starting from the primordial spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "this differs from previous studies where the starting point is the present matter power spectrum ( which is evolved backward in order to find its correlation with cmb ) .",
    "our approach unifies the treatment of cmb and matter power spectra , and is more convenient for taking full account of fluctuations in the dark energy .",
    "moreover , since all perturbations are evolved numerically with the cmbfast code @xcite , we do not resort to the frequently used approximate analytical expressions for the growth function , or the also commonly used small angle approximation @xcite .",
    "the details of our calculation are reported in the appendix .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ evolution ]",
    "we describe the evolution of the universe according to the doomsday model .",
    "we also show that the corresponding cmb and present matter power spectra are virtually identical to those which are obtained in a model with a constant @xmath20 , equal to the average @xmath18 for the doomsday model . in section",
    "[ temp - matter ] we study the matter / cmb temperature cross - correlation , and show that it can be used to break this degeneracy .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "we are interested in the late time evolution of our observable universe , and so we assume a background model which is homogeneous and isotropic . in addition to the scalar field",
    "@xmath3 with linear potential ( [ linear ] ) , the universe contains the usual radiation and matter .",
    "the dynamics is given by the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) equation and the scalar field equation @xmath22 @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the fractional energy density in matter today , and @xmath13 is the present hubble rate .",
    "in addition to the equations of motion , we need to specify initial or boundary conditions . at early times ( @xmath25 )",
    ", we expect that the scalar field is at rest and so @xmath26 .",
    "this is because , in the back of our minds , we imagine an inflationary phase which redshifts the gradients and velocities of the scalar field .",
    "hence the scalar field is effectively homogeneous and static at @xmath27 .",
    "the initial value of the scale factor is zero as in usual friedmann - robertson - walker evolution .",
    "the initial value of the scalar field is a free parameter .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this takes different values in distant regions of the universe , separated by distances much larger than the present hubble radius .",
    "finally , we require that the present value of the total energy density be unity .",
    "this is a boundary condition .",
    "these conditions can be summarized as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the present time , defined by the requirement that @xmath30 .    the cosmological evolution following from eqs .",
    "( [ frweq ] ) , ( [ phieq ] ) and ( [ initconditions ] ) has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "the main features of the evolution are as follows :    * the universe starts out dominated by matter and hence @xmath31 . at the same time the scalar field is essentially at rest . * after some time , the matter density falls below that of the scalar field potential energy , and the evolution becomes scalar field dominated .",
    "since most of the energy in the scalar field is potential energy , we have @xmath32 . *",
    "as the field slips down the potential , the potential energy changes sign once @xmath3 changes sign . with further slipping ,",
    "a time comes when the total energy density is zero .",
    "this epoch marks the turning point , where cosmic expansion changes to contraction . from this time on , @xmath33 is given by the _ negative _ square root of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ frweq ] ) . *",
    "as the universe starts contracting , the kinetic energy of the scalar field comes to dominate .",
    "but there is no stopping the contracting phase , and the universe rapidly arrives at the big crunch .",
    "these features are apparent in fig .",
    "[ avst ] , where the time evolution of the universe is represented for different values of the dimensionless slope @xmath34 one feature of this evolution that is relevant for observational cosmology is that the equation of state for the scalar field changes in an unconventional manner .",
    "very early on , @xmath35 and hence @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath1 denote pressure and energy density in @xmath3 . the dark energy equation of state parameter",
    "is defined by @xmath38 since @xmath39 at early times , @xmath40 . at later times , the field starts to roll down the potential and hence the kinetic energy starts to play a role in @xmath37 and @xmath1 .",
    "this means that @xmath20 _ increases _ with time . in fig .",
    "[ wvsz ] we show @xmath20 as a function of redshift @xmath17 ( figures analogous to figs .  [ avst ] and [ wvsz ] can also be found in @xcite ) .",
    "if we only varied @xmath41 , keeping all other cosmological parameters fixed , we would change the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface and spoil the agreement with current cmb data .",
    "hence it is necessary to suitably adjust cosmological parameters for different values of @xmath41 .",
    "the cosmological parameters in models with different values of @xmath41 , presented in figs .",
    "[ avst ] and [ wvsz ] , depend on @xmath41 .",
    "the simplest way to preserve the shape of the cmb fluctuations spectra on small and intermediate scales ( where the cosmic variance is small ) is to explore the so - called geometric degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the shape of the spectra depends mainly on two scales : @xmath42  the sound horizon at the time of recombination , and @xmath43  the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface .",
    "models with same values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 have the same @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 are the total matter and baryon density fractions today , and @xmath48 km @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "since the dark energy did not play a significant role at the time of recombination , changing the value of @xmath41 , or @xmath20 , does not affect @xmath42 .",
    "the main effect changes in the properties of the dark energy have on the cmb spectra on small angular scales are due to the change in @xmath43 , which manifests itself as a shift in the positions of the peaks in the angular spectra .",
    "this shift can be compensated for , without altering the structure of the peaks , by adjusting the value of @xmath51 . as a reference model",
    "we use wmap s best fit power law @xmath52cdm model @xcite with @xmath53 , spectral index @xmath54 , reionization optical depth @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and amplitude @xmath58 ( as defined in @xcite ) .",

    "the equation of state parameter can vary significantly at recent redshifts .",
    "this variation is not necessarily constrained by existing analysis of supernova data @xcite , which by and large assumed a constant @xmath20 . in fig .",

    "the equation of state parameter @xmath83 obviously has an impact on different observables , such as cmb and matter power spectra .",
    "in particular , it should affect the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) contributions to cmb anisotropies . at first sight",

    ", there is no late isw effect . in the doomsday scenario ,",
    "the dark energy equation of state is closer to that of ordinary matter , and one might expect that the isw effect would be smaller than in the @xmath21 case .",
    "however , the dark energy perturbations are coupled to the dark matter perturbations , and will also contribute to the isw effect .",
    "the net result is that there is no suppression of the isw effect even for values of @xmath41 corresponding to average @xmath20 as high as @xmath76 .",

    "the choice of the selection function @xmath115 depends on which large scale structure data set one wants to consider .",

    "our results for @xmath122 for the @xmath52cdm model are consistent with those of @xcite , when appropriate biases and selection functions are used .",
    "eq  ( [ crosscor ] ) differs from the analogous expressions in @xcite as it uses the primordial curvature power spectrum rather than today s matter power spectrum .",

    "@xmath122 can be particularly useful for differentiating between @xmath123 and varying @xmath20 models .",

    "of these two , the cleanest input is the cmb .",
    "although very precise , current cmb data can not separate the isw contribution from the net anisotropy , which reduces the signal - to - noise ratio of the cross correlation .",
    "there is hope , however , that such separation may be possible in the future , with measurements of cmb polarization towards galaxy clusters @xcite .    a prime source of uncertainty in the matter distribution",
    "is the bias factor .",
    "one way to proceed ( which has been implicitly used _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite ) is the following . from the observed cmb autocorrelation , and following the steps we have described in the previous section , the matter power spectrum can be normalized . comparing this to the autocorrelation function of any given matter survey",
    ", the bias factor can be inferred . hence ,",
    "from the cross correlation of the survey with the cmb data one can infer the cross correlation function of the matter distribution with the cmb .",
    "note in particular that the predictions for the matter spectra for the @xmath72 and @xmath71 models are practically indistinguishable ( see .",
    "[ pvsk ] ) . hence ,",

    "error bars in current determinations of the cross - correlation function @xcite are still too large to distinguish between models .",
    "however , the results in @xcite have been obtained by using just a small fraction of the sky , and the situation may improve considerably with fuller sky coverage . also , the uncertainties in bias may be substantially reduced with further observations such as weak lensing surveys .",
    "the differences in the cross correlation between the models considered in this section can be as large as @xmath139 , and they have a substantial dependence on redshift .",
    "hence , it seems plausible that they may fall within the range of detectability in a not too distant future .",
    "current efforts to understand the dark energy component of our universe often employ dynamical scalar fields .",
    "the dynamics of such scalar fields lead to variation of the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath20 .",
    "we have considered astrophysical signatures of a varying equation of state , @xmath83 , in the context of doomsday models .",
    "there are two main issues that we have considered .",
    "first , can we tell if the average value of @xmath20 is different from @xmath140 .",
    "secondly , what astrophysical signatures are sensitive to the time variation of @xmath20 ?    to address both issues , we have considered autocorrelations of the cmb temperature anisotropies , the matter power spectrum , and cross - correlation of the anisotropy with matter fluctuations .",
    "the wmap data is well reproduced by models with different average value of @xmath20 by suitably adjusting the hubble parameter , and therefore the cmb data can not by itself discriminate amongst different models . for a given cmb ,",
    "the present linear matter power spectrum is sensitive to the average value of @xmath83 , but not to its time dependence ( see fig . [ pvsk ] ) . finally , the temperature - matter ( tm)cross - correlation is sensitive to both the average value of @xmath20 and to the time variation ( see figs . [ multiw ] , [ multicl ] and [ ampl ] ) .",
    "the tm cross - correlation requires accurate determination of both cmb anisotropies and the matter fluctuations .",
    "ongoing cmb observations have been very successful at producing data with very small error bars and it is likely that the situation will improve even further in the coming years .",
    "accurate surveys of the matter fluctuations are likely to be more challenging since there are unknowns such as the bias factor . however , since the cmb anisotropies and large - scale structure originate from the same density fluctuations , it is quite possible that a combination of the data can significantly reduce the uncertainties .",
    "we have shown that the optimal strategy for detecting a doomsday variation of @xmath83 is to use a survey in the redshift range @xmath141 $ ] .",
    "observations of supernovae over the next ten years are also likely to provide information on @xmath83 , as discussed in ref .",
    "the advantage of planned supernovae observations are that they provide direct information on the hubble expansion rate which is closely related to @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , the data will be of good quality , with small error bars",
    ". however , the observations may not be too sensitive to rapid variation of @xmath83 at recent redshifts , the hallmark of the doomsday scenario .",
    "the tm cross - correlations , on the other hand , are sensitive to this time variation and may perhaps be used together with the supernovae observations to further constrain @xmath83 .",
