    "very recently , we proposed a charged ( 3 + 1)-dimensional gravastar admitting conformal motion @xcite in the frame work of mazur and mottola model of a chargeless gravastar  @xcite .",
    "the model implies that the space of a gravastar has three different regions defined by different equations of state ( eos ) as : ( i ) interior:@xmath8 , @xmath9 , ( ii ) shell:@xmath10 , @xmath11 and ( iii ) exterior:@xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "this provides an alternative to static black holes , however , energy density is found to diverge in the interior region of the gravastar , which scales like an inverse second power of its radius .",
    "this behaviour makes the model singular at @xmath14 .    in order to find a non - singular alternative to black holes ,",
    "it is worth exploring non - singular gravastars in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensions which offer clarity to study concepts of gravity .",
    "thus , we study the work of mazur and mottola with chargeless gravastar in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions @xcite under the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time .",
    "we show that the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional neutral gravastars do exist without any curvature singularity at the origin , which may be considered as an alternative to btz black holes as presented by baados , teitelboim and zanelli ( btz ) @xcite .",
    "it is known that in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional space - time , newtonian theory can not be obtained as a limit of einstein s theory . in other words ,",
    "general relativity in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions has no newtonian limit and no propagating degrees of freedom @xcite . also , gravastar structure can not be obtained from newtonian gravity .",
    "but it is argued that einstein s general theory of relativity admits gravastar structure that has three different regions such as interior , shell and exterior defined by different equations of state ( eos ) and this provides an alternative to static black holes .",
    "the presence of matter on the thin shell is required to achieve the crucial stability of such systems under expansion by exerting an inward force to balance the repulsion from within .",
    "for this reason , ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional gravastar structure have considered here .",
    "collapsing matter may appear into a final state of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional black hole with no curvature singularity at the origin .",
    "an explicit vacuum solution of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity with nonzero negative cosmological constant obtained by baados , teitelboim and zanelli ( btz ) @xcite did demonstrate the existence of such physical systems with an event horizon and thermodynamic properties similar to ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional black holes .",
    "these are known as btz black holes , which are asymptotically anti - de sitter .",
    "a great number of good reviews on the subject are available in the literature  @xcite .    for a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravastar ,",
    "intermediate region is a 2-dimensional junction instead of a closed spherical shell . like btz model , @xmath7",
    "is taken to be negative , which at the junction shell turns out to be positive as required for gravastar and mathematical consistency .",
    "it is like requirement of negative energy at the junction between two separated gravitational sources to cancel out excess positive energy .",
    "the scheme of the investigation is as follows : in section ii , iii and iv respectively we discuss the interior space - time , exterior space - time and shell whereas sections v , vi and vii respectively are devoted to the length and energy , entropy , and junction conditions of the spherical distribution .",
    "we take the line element for the interior space - time of a static spherically symmetric distribution of matter in @xmath0 dimensions in the form @xmath15    we assume that the matter distribution at the interior of the star is perfect fluid type , given by @xmath16    where , @xmath17 represents the energy density , @xmath18 is the isotropic pressure , and @xmath19 is the @xmath20-velocity of the fluid . the einstein s field equations with a cosmological constant ( @xmath21 ) , for the space - time described by the metric ( [ eq1 ] ) together with the energy - momentum tensor given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , yield ( rendering @xmath22 ) @xmath23 where a ` @xmath24 ' denotes differentiation with respect to the radial parameter @xmath25 .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq3])-([eq5 ] ) , we get @xmath26 which is the conservation equation in @xmath0 dimensions .    in the interior region",
    "i , by the use of the assumption @xmath9 iteratively , the equation ( 6 ) yields @xmath27    let us call this constant as ,  @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hubble parameter with its present day constant value .",
    "in other words , it may be expressed as follows @xmath30    we would like to mention that the equation of state @xmath9 ( known in the literature as a false vacuum , degenerate vacuum , or @xmath17-vacuum @xcite ) represents a repulsive pressure . in the context of an accelerating universe ,",
    "it is argued by usmani et al .",
    "@xcite that the equation of state of the kind @xmath9 may be related to the _ @xmath7-dark energy _ , an agent responsible for the second phase of the inflation of hot big bang theory @xcite .",
    "by using the eq .",
    "( 8) , one can get the solutions for @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the field equations as @xmath33 where a is an integration constant .",
    "hence , the active gravitational mass @xmath34 can be expressed at once in the following form @xmath35 from the above eq .",
    "( 9 ) we observe that the space - time metric thus obtained is free from any central singularity .",
    "for the exterior region ( @xmath36 ) , the btz space - time is @xmath37 the parameter @xmath38 is the conserved mass associated with asymptotic invariance under time displacements .",
    "this mass is given by a flux integral through a large circle at space - like infinity .",
    "the equation of state in the shell ii is @xmath39 , which represents a stiff fluid .",
    "we note that this type of equation of state which refers to a zeldovich universe have been selected by several authors for various situations in cosmology @xcite as well as astrophysics @xcite .    within the shell the eqs .",
    "( 3 ) - ( 5 ) can be solved implicitly .",
    "however , it is possible to obtain analytic solution in the thin shell limit , @xmath40 .",
    "we first try to find implicit solution and later we shall find limiting solution .      by equating eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , one gets @xmath41 which eventually yields @xmath42 after a little bit manipulation and calculation , we then get @xmath43 by the use of any computer programme one can get a solution which , after exploiting the stiff fluid equation of state @xmath44 and the eq . ( 6 ) , is as follows : @xmath45 @xmath46 being an integration constant .",
    "thus , if @xmath31 is known , then all parameters can be found in terms of @xmath31 .",
    "let us define @xmath47 .",
    "then the field eqs .",

    ", we have the constant pressure term as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the einstein s erstwhile cosmological constant .",
    "we assume the interfaces at @xmath59 and @xmath60 describing the phase boundary of region i and region iii respectively are very close .",
    "that is , @xmath61 with @xmath62",
    ". the proper thickness between two interfaces i.e. of the shell is obtained as : @xmath63_{r}^{r+\\epsilon}.\\label{eq21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if we expand @xmath64 binomially about @xmath65 and take first order of @xmath66 , then , @xmath67 and our @xmath68 would be @xmath69 . obviously , here",
    "the length must be a real and positive quantity and the constraint should be @xmath70 . actually , the thickness between two interfaces becomes infinite for the constant value of @xmath53 as @xmath71 and hence this identity is not applicable .",
    "we now calculate the energy @xmath72 within the shell only and we get @xmath73_{r}^{r+\\epsilon}. \\label{eq22}\\ ] ]    in the similar way , as we have done above , by expanding @xmath64 binomially about @xmath65 and taking first order of @xmath66 , we get @xmath74 ^ 2 $ ] with the condition to be imposed @xmath75 .",
    "following mazur and mottola @xcite , we now calculate the entropy by letting @xmath76 and @xmath77 : @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the entropy density for the local temperature t(r ) , which may be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "thus the entropy of the fluid within the shell , via the eq .",

    "the junction surface is a one dimensional ring of matter .",
    "let , @xmath83 denotes the riemann normal coordinate at the junction .",
    "we assume @xmath83 be positive in the manifold in region iii described by exterior btz spacetime and @xmath83 be negative in the manifold in region i described by our interior space - time and @xmath84 .",
    "the second fundamental forms associated with the two sides of the shell @xcite are given by @xmath85 so , the discontinuity in the second fundamental forms is given as @xmath86 in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional spacetime , the field equations are derived @xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are line energy density and line tension .",
