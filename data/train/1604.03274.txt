    "heavy fermion compounds are a much studied class of materials in the field of strongly correlated electron systems . among the many phenomena observed in these compounds",
    "is a variety of phase transitions between different magnetically ordered and nonmagnetic phases which occur as a function of temperature , pressure , alloying , or magnetic field .",
    "often the transition temperature can be driven to zero kelvin by varying some experimental parameter resulting in quantum critical points and superconductivity@xcite .",
    "the simplest model believed to be able to describe these compounds is the kondo lattice model , which is obtained from the more realistic periodic anderson model by means of the schrieffer - wolff transformation@xcite and describes a single conduction band coupled to a periodic array of loaclized spins by spin - exchange , @xmath3 thereby each unit cell @xmath4 is assumed to contain one conduction band ( or @xmath5 ) orbital and one localized ( or @xmath6 ) orbital , the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 create an electron with z - spin @xmath9 in these .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the vector of pauli matrices whereas @xmath12 denotes the spin operator of the localized electrons and @xmath13 is the dispersion relation of the conduction band .",
    "+ it is widely believed that the magnetic phase transitions are the consequence of a competition between the kondo - effect and the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) interaction between the localized electrons@xcite .",
    "the essence of the kondo effect is the formation of singlets between a localized electron and a conduction electron , leading to a vanishing of the expectation value @xmath14 , whereas the rkky - interaction - or any other mechanism favouring magnetic order such as a magnetic field - favours a nonvanishing @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , there is an inherent frustration in the kondo lattice model and slight perturbations may tilt the balance and induce a phase transition .",
    "moreover , for a lattice of localized spins the kondo effect leads to a fermi surface volume to which the localized electrons contribute as if they were itinerant .",
    "the transitions between ` kondo - dominated ' and ` rkky - dominated ' phases therefore are often accompanied by a reconstruction of the fermi surface which goes beyond the simple generation of umklapps but rather changes the volume of the fermi surface by an amount corresponding to half of an electron per spin and @xmath6-site .",
    "+ while the single impurity kondo problem can be solved exactly the kondo lattice hamiltonian is less well understood .",
    "following the work of yoshimori and sakurai@xcite , lacroix and cyrot@xcite studied the kondo lattice in mean field theory .",
    "for a band with a constant density of states in the range @xmath16 $ ] and electron densities close to @xmath17 lacroix and cyrot found a paramagnetic and a nel ordered solution . at @xmath18",
    "the antiferromagnetic phase thereby turns out to have lower energy than the paramagnetic one for @xmath19 .",
    "its ordered @xmath6-moment always has the maximum value of @xmath20@xcite so that the phase transition is 1@xmath21 order .",
    "various other mean - field studies of the kondo lattice were performed since then@xcite but it appears to be difficult to reproduce the phase diagrams of heavy fermion compounds by this approach . + since then the model was also studied by renormalization group@xcite and extended dynamical mean field theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) and a global phase diagram was outlined@xcite .",
    "additional work has focussed on the properties of quasiparticles near the quantum critical points@xcite and the phenomenological two - fluid model was proposed ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "+ in the present manuscript we present an approximation in terms of bond fermions which reproduces a few results obtained previously only by numerical methods , such as the phase diagram containing two antiferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase .",
    "as will be discussed below this phase diagram also qualitatively reproduces some experimental results on heavy fermion compounds .",
    "in the following we consider the hamiltonian ( [ kondola ] ) on a 2d square lattice of @xmath22 unit cells , the number of conduction electrons is @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for the dispersion of the conduction band , @xmath13 , we assume a tight - binding form with hopping integrals @xmath25 between nearest and @xmath26 between second nearest neigbors i.e. @xmath27 the calculation to be outlined below may be viewed as a fermionic version of the bond operator theory proposed by sachdev and bhatt to describe bosonic spin fluctuations in quantum spin systems@xcite which was applied successfully to spin ladders @xcite . in deriving the fermionic version",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a more rigorous derivation . in the limit @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "the ground state is a product of singlets @xmath30 the energy of this state is @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "switching on nonvanishing hopping integrals produces _ charge fluctuations _ , e.g. an electron with spin @xmath9 can be transferred from some cell @xmath33 to another cell @xmath34 , resulting in a state with three electrons in @xmath34 and a single electron in @xmath33 . in subsequent steps",
    "either the surplus electron or the hole may propagate to other sites or additional electron - hole pairs may be generated . in ref .",
    "@xcite the product of singlets ( [ vacuum_0 ] ) was considered as the vacuum @xmath35 for charge fluctuations which themselves were described as effective fermions ( here we will call them ` bond fermions ' ) there are hole - like and electron - like bond fermions , and states containing a single of these correspond to states of the true kondo lattice as follows : @xmath36 the generalization to states with more than one bond fermion is self - evident , the only requirement being that the factors of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the kondo - lattice states be in the same order as the @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the bond fermion states . since a unit cell with either one or three electrons has an exchange energy of @xmath41 we ascribe an energy of formation of @xmath42 to each bond fermion .",
    "operators for the bond fermions are obtained by demanding that their matrix elements between bond fermions states be identical to those of the physical operator between the respective translated states . due to the product nature of states like ( [ singles ] )",
    "this is usually easy to achieve .",
    "for example , the electron annihilation operator becomes @xmath43 fourier transformation gives the representation of @xmath44 and inserting this into the kinetic energy @xmath45 the hamiltonian becomes@xcite : @xmath46 + n\\ ; e_0 .",
    "\\label{stcham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the positive sign of the additive constant is not a misprint - rather , this is the sum of the energy of the vacuum state ( [ vacuum_0 ] ) , @xmath47 , and a term @xmath48 obtained by inverting @xmath49 products of fermion operators @xmath50 . in using the hamiltonian ( [ stcham ] )",
    "we are making two approximations : first , the possibility that a unit cell containing two electrons is in a triplet state is neglected .",
    "this means we neglect bosonic spin excitations and their coupling to the fermionic charge fluctuations .",
    "second , states like @xmath51 or @xmath52 where two bond fermions occupy the same unit cell obviously are meaningless so that the bond fermions have to obey a hard core constraint - which we neglect in the following .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail in section v. + since the vacuum state ( [ vacuum_0 ] ) contains @xmath49 electrons _ including the localized electrons _ and since adding an @xmath53-fermion ( a @xmath54-fermion ) decreases ( increases ) the electron number by one , the total number of electrons is @xmath55 an extra complication - discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite - is the following : after tuning the electron number to any prescribed value @xmath56 by adding the term @xmath57 to the hamiltonian and adjusting @xmath58 , the @xmath59-integrated conduction electron momentum distribution function @xmath60 - which equals the @xmath59- and @xmath61 integrated photoemission weight - in general is not equal to @xmath62 . as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite we resolve this problem by enforcing the equalitiy of @xmath23 and @xmath59-integrated @xmath63 via an additional lagrange multiplier @xmath64 , i.e. we add the term @xmath65 to @xmath66 and adjust @xmath64 .",
    "this amounts to replacing @xmath67 in ( [ stcham ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ stcham ] ) then can be solved by a unitary transformation @xmath68 in terms of the quasiparticle operators @xmath69 the electron number ( [ totel ] ) becomes @xmath70 while all bond fermion basis states such as ( [ singles ] ) have exactly one @xmath6-electron per unit cell so that the @xmath6-electrons are perfectly localized , the fermi surface volume therefore is such as if the @xmath6-electrons were itinerant .",
    "the quasipartile dispersion and conduction electron momentum distribution become ( for @xmath71 ) : @xmath72 for @xmath73 the band structure approaches the noninteracting @xmath13 plus a dispersionless band at energy @xmath64 whereas @xmath74 . in this limit",
    "both @xmath64 and @xmath58 must be set equal to the noninteracting chemical potential whence the total energy becomes that of the free fermi sea .",
    "for @xmath75 we have two bands at @xmath76 .",
    "for @xmath77 the chemical potential cuts into the lower of these two bands , resulting in a total energy of @xmath78 .",
    "again , this is the correct limiting behaviour because for @xmath75 the ground state has @xmath23 singlets and @xmath79 mobile @xmath5-vacancies which contribute an energy @xmath80 .",
    "the ground state energy obtained from the bond fermion calculation accordingly interpolates between these two exactly known limiting values .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] compares some results obtained in this way for a 1d chain with @xmath17 - i.e. the kondo insulator - and @xmath81 to the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) results of yu and white@xcite .",

    "the panel for the energy also shows the series expansion results from ref .",

    "+ identifying the icam phase with the af ii phase and the cam phase with the af i phase and assuming that alloying with co simply amounts to increasing @xmath94 due to the contraction of the lattice at constant @xmath188 all of this would qualitatively match the behaviour in figure [ fig10 ] quite well : a 1@xmath21 order transition from the af ii phase with large moment , light effective mass and a fermi surface which comprises only the @xmath5-electrons to the af i phase with small ordered moment , large effective mass and a fermi surface which comprises both @xmath5 and @xmath6-electrons , followd by a 2@xmath136 order transition to the paramagnetic phase where neither the effective mass nor the fermi surface volume change . that the component of the ordering vector perpendicular to the cein - planes changes at the transition between af ii and af i phase would not be too surprising . if the hopping matrix elements in @xmath5-direction change with the component of the bloch wave vector @xmath59 within the cein - plane , @xmath189 , a relatively strong change of the fermi contour as in figure [ fig9 ] certainly can strongly modify the coupling between the planes and thus affect the ordering vector . + on the other hand , applying pressure to cerhin@xmath2 leads to a completely different behaviour . at @xmath190",
    "there is a first transition - or rather a ` crossover ' - where only the component of the magnetic ordering vector perpendicular to the cein planes changes@xcite .",
    "no change of either the fermi surface volume or the cyclotron mass is observed at this crossover@xcite . in our simplified model",
    "a change of the magnetic order perpendicular to the planes can not be modelled so we ignore this transition .",
    "one possible explanation for this transition would be that the effective mass changes with pressure - as seen in figure [ fig10 ] if one assumes that pressure changes @xmath94 - and if the interplane hopping @xmath191 is renormalized by the quasiparticle weight @xmath192@xcite this may as well influence the coupling between planes .",
    "increasing the pressure further induces a second transition at @xmath193 to a paramagnetic phase whose fermi surface cross sections are identical to those of cecoin@xmath2 - corresponding to itinerant ce 4f electrons - whereas the cyclotron masses seem to diverge at the transition@xcite .",
    "the limiting values of the cyclotron masses approached for large @xmath194 on the two sides of the transition differ considerably , whereby the values in the paramagnetic phase are larger by a factor of @xmath195 . with the exception of the divergence of the cyclotron mass at the transition - which can not be reproduced by a simple theory as the present one",
    "- this could correspond to a direct ( 1@xmath21 order ) transition af - ii @xmath196 para in the phase diagram in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "+ generally , reducing the volume of the lattice by either applying pressure or isovalent doping with ions with a smaller ionic raius may be expected to enhance the overlap of atomic orbitals so that all hopping elements increase , but the rate of increase varies with the character of the two connected orbitals . on the other hand , the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion",
    "@xmath197 will remain essentially unchanged , whereas the charge transfer energy @xmath198 may change due to a variation of the madelung potential although it is hard to predict if @xmath198 increases or decreases . from the schrieffer - wolff transformation the kondo exchange constant @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the @xmath5-@xmath6 hybridization .",
    "due to the higher power of @xmath200 in @xmath138 , a plausible guess is that @xmath94 increases upon contraction of the crystal .",
    "on the other hand , this may not be the only effect of the contraction .",
    "since the hybridization integrals between different pairs of orbitals change at a different rate , the width of different bands also may change at a different rate .",
    "accordingly it may happen that small ` uncorrelated ' electron- or hole - pockets participating in the fermi surface - which are known to exist in cerhin@xmath2 from de - haas van - alphen experiments@xcite - may shrink or expand if the band which forms the pocket changes its width at a different rate as compared to band which mixes with the 4f electrons . in this way",
    ", electrons may be transferred from the pockets to the band which interacts with the localized moments or vice versa so that contraction of the lattice may in addition change also the conduction electron density @xmath188 in our simplified model .",
    "having noticed this we conclude that it may also make a difference if the contraction is due to hydrostatic pressure or by doping the material with ions that have a smaller ionic radius because these perturbations may affect different bonds in the solid in a different way",
    ". therefore it might not be too surprising if applying hydrostatic pressure or alloying with co would drive cerhin@xmath2 through a phase diagram like that in figure [ fig6 ] along different routes .",
    "+ another example for a compound undergoing a pressure induced phase transition from an antiferromagnetic phase to a paramagnetic phase is cerh@xmath201si@xmath201@xcite which also has layered structure comprising planes where ce atoms form a 2d square lattice . at @xmath202 antiferromagnetism",
    "disappears and the fermi surface changes from being consistent with the density functional fermi surface of larh@xmath201si@xmath201 to being consistent with that for cerh@xmath201si@xmath201 - which again corresponds to the ce-4f electrons changing from localized to itinerant@xcite .",
    "whereas three sheets of the fermi surface could be resolved at ambient pressure only one sheet is observed above @xmath203 and this has a cyclotron mass which is larger by a factor of @xmath204 than the ones below @xmath203 .",
    "again , there seems to be a transition from an antiferromagnetic phase with localized @xmath6-electrons and relatively light masses to a paramagnetic phase with itinerant @xmath6-electrons and heavy masses which might correspond to the transition af ii @xmath196 paramagnetic in the calculated phase diagram .",
    "lastly , a transition between two different antiferromagnetic phases has been observed in cecu@xmath205au@xmath1@xcite . applying pressure to cecu@xmath206au@xmath207 results in an apparent 1@xmath21 order transition between two phases which differ in their ordering vector .",
    "lastly we discuss the approximations that were made .",
    "as already stated , the bond fermions in principle have to obey a hard - core constraint , that means no two of them - which could differ either in their spin or species - are allowed to occupy the same unit cell because such a state can not be translated meaningfully to a state of the true kondo lattice . instead , in all the above calculations",
    "the bond fermions were treated as free fermions which is an uncontrolled approximation .",
    "however , there is a simple way to judge inhowmuch this assumption is justified namely to calculate for the ground state so obtained the probability @xmath208 that the constraint is violated at a given site . since we are dealing with noninteracting fermions this",
    "is easily evaluated .",
    "there are five allowed states of a given cell , namely the empty cell or a state with a single bond fermion of either spin direction and either species .",
    "the probability for the cell to be in one of these five allowed states is @xmath209 where @xmath210 and similar for @xmath211 .",
    "the probability for the constraint to be violated then is @xmath212 .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows @xmath208 as a function of @xmath94 for different dopings . for values of @xmath213 one",
    "has @xmath214 .",
    "+ to put this in perspective , we consider other cases where a constraint is relaxed . in linear spin wave theory for the spin-@xmath215 heisenberg",
    "antiferromagnet@xcite the bosonic magnons have to obey a hard - core constraint because a given spin can be flipped only once relative to the nel order so that the presence of two magnons at the same site is unphysical . from the known reduction of the ordered moment",
    "one can infer that even for the 2d case - where quantum fluctuations are strongest - the density of magnons is only @xmath216 per site .",
    "accordingly , the probability that two magnons occupy the same site - and thus violate the constraint - is @xmath217 .",
    "in fact , linear spin wave theory gives an excellent quantitative description of heisenberg antiferromagnets .",
    "+ as a second example we consider mean - field theories for the kondo lattice@xcite .",
    "there the heisenberg exchange is hartree - fock decoupled resulting in a mean - field hamiltonian which is a quadratic form and describes the mixing between the original conduction band and a dispersionless band of @xmath6-electrons .",
    "the number of @xmath6-electrons then is adjusted to one per unit cell by tuning the energy of the effective @xmath6-level .",
    "since the @xmath6-electrons are uncorrelated and their density is @xmath150 per unit cell and spin , the probability that there are either @xmath218 or @xmath41 @xmath6-electrons in a cell so that the constraint is violated is @xmath219 + for the bond fermions the probability for a violation of the constraint thus is not as small as in linear spin wave theory and one may expect stronger deviations e.g. for the ground state energy which probably is the reason for the incorrect value of @xmath133 . + one might consider an approximate treatment of the hardcore constraint by gutzwiller projection or by a mean - field theory similar to the one proposed by sachdev and bhatt@xcite .",
    "in fact , using the mean - field procedure for the kondo insulator with @xmath81 jurecka and brenig obtained the value @xmath220 , very close to the exact value from qmc@xcite .",
    "however , we have tried both methods and abandoned them because both of them lead to a substantial narrowing of the conduction band . on the other hand , all available numerical results for the single particle spectral function of the kondo lattice - or the related periodic anderson model - agree in that the conduction electron bandwith retains its original width of @xmath221 ( with @xmath102 the number of nearest neighbors ) see for example fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite , fig . 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite , or fig . 4 in ref @xcite .",
    "any ` correlation narrowing ' of the conduction band thus obviously is unphysical .",
    "moreover , as was discussed above , the bond fermion theory without any constraint does reproduce the correct limiting value of the ground state energy for @xmath73 .",
    "this favourable property is lost if any renormalization of the hopping integrals is introduced .",
    "the best procedure therefore probably is to accept the inaccuracy and simply relax the constraint without further correction .",
    "probability @xmath208 for violation of the constraint in the paramagnetic solution versus @xmath94 for different hole doping @xmath153 . ]",
    "in summary we have presented a theory for ground state and single particle spectrum the kondo lattice based on bond fermions . thereby the constraint of having precisley one @xmath6-electron per unit cell",
    "is fulfilled exactly , instead we are relaxing the hard core constraint on the bond fermions which however turns out to be reasonably justified as the probability for violation of the constraint is low for not too small values of @xmath94 . while being of comparable simplicity as mean - field theory the bond fermion theory gives results which differ significantly from mean - field theory .",
    "rather , the theory reproduces qualitatively a number of results obtained previously only by numerical methods .",
    "in particular we find two different antiferromagnetic phases , the first one with a small ordered moment and antiferromagnetically folded ` heavy ' bands where the localized electrons do contribute to the fermi surface volume , the second one with larger ordered moment and a fermi surface which corresponds to the backfolded fermi surface of the conduction electrons alone and relatively light bands at the fermi surface .",
    "qualitatively the resulting phase diagram is quite consistent with experiments on cerhin@xmath2 .",
    "while in the present manuscript we have studied only simple two - sublattice nel order the generalization to more complicated magnetic structures is self - evident .",
