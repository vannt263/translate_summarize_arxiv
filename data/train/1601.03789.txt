    "fluctuations in the matter and radiation density include dark matter , baryon matter and photons , which interact with each other through gravitational potential created by themselves ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these fluctuations grow through gravitational instability as the universe expands and then decouple to form on the one hand what we know today as cosmic background radiation ( photons ) and on the other hand the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe ( dark matter and luminous matter ) . before of recombination ,",
    "the radiation hot enough to ionize hydrogen . due to the compton scattering of electrons , these couples strongly to the photons and through the coulomb interaction to protons , thereby forming one photon - baryon fluid .",
    "the radiation pressure of photons opposes the gravitational compression of the fluid in free fall and thus establishing the so - called baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) . at recombination epoch ( @xmath1 ) , photons decoupled from matter and the latter can to form neutral elements .",
    "photons are scattered for the last time , forming the so - called cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resultant fluctuations in these cosmic background , the which are observed in radiation maps as anisotropies , exhibit regions of compression and rarefaction at the present epoch as hot ( red - yellow ) and cold ( yellow - blue ) spots respectively ( figure  [ figure_1 ] ) .",
    "these fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation are better studied in its power spectrum ( figure  [ figure_1 ] ) .",
    "the gravitational driving force is due to the newtonian potential , where overdensities of photon - baryon fluid produce a negative potential and large curvature of space - time .",
    "therefore , before recombination photons follow the matter in its harmonic motion , so that when compressions occur temperature is higher in the potential well and the rarefaction the opposite",
    ". at the time of recombination average temperature drops , may be formed neutral atoms and the photons decouple from the baryons and stream out of potential wells experiencing gravitational redshifts , known as sachs - wolfe effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "the phase of the oscillation at last scattering surface determines the characteristic patterns of fluctuations in the power spectrum , such that long wavelength could not have evolved and short wavelengths could be frozen at different phases and amplitudes of oscillation .",
    "so , even peaks represent rarefaction phases and odd peaks represent phases of compression .",
    "although effectively without pressure , the baryons still contribute to inertia and gravitational mass of fluid , which produces a change in the balance of pressure and gravity , when the baryons drag photons in potential wells , also known as the epoch of drag .",
    "subsequently photons are diluted with the expansion and come to us with an average temperature of @xmath2 .",
    "+ our analysis , begin with the anisotropies of the cmb @xmath3 , then the theoretical foundations of pgws @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and then finish with the state of the art observational @xmath7 .",
    "the cmb consist of photons that last interacted with the matter @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) . since the universe must have already been inhomogeneous at this time , in order for the structures present in the universe today to be able to form , it is expect that these spatial inhomogeneous are reflect in small anisotropies of the cmb measured by experiments as wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xmath9 ( figure  [ cmb1 ] ) . as cmb anisotropies",
    "are small , they can be treated nearly completely within linear cosmological perturbation theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since the cmb anisotropies are a function on a sphere , they can be expanded in spherical harmonics :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the mean temperature on the sky .",
    "we define the power spectrum through the relation @xmath13 , where the @xmath14 are the cmb power spectrum , which is related to the sources at recombination through    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is a spectral distribution that depends on the gravitational potential and bessel functions and @xmath17 is the scalar power spectrum . the cmb power spectrum compared with observations",
    "is showed in figure  [ figure_1 ] , where @xmath18 factor represents the contribution of temperature to the fluctuations .",
    "different values of the multipole @xmath19 represent different angular scales as hubble radius ( first acoustic peak ) , super galaxy clusters ( second peak ) , thickness of the last scattering surface ( third peak ) , galaxy clusters ( fourth peak ) and galaxies ( fifth peak ) .",
    "different mechanisms contribute to the formation of these acoustic peaks at different scales , sush as : sachs - wolfe effect , doppler effect ( vishniac , kinetic s - z ) , sunyaev - zeldovich thermal effect , gravitational lensing , rees - sciama and the effect of our interest , gravitational waves .",
    "cmb acoustic peaks depends strongly on the main cosmological parameters , making the cmb power spectrum one of most important observational test .",
    "the dependence of these parameters is given through the so - called angular diameter distance at the last scattering .",
    "in this paper we use the shift parameter , as a powerful geometric test , to achieve constraints on main cosmological parameters of @xmath20 model and the spectrum of gravitational waves .",
    "in a flat universe filled with dustlike matter , the linearized einstein equations will have the following solution for the tensor metric perturbations describing gravitational waves :    @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the conformal time and the tensor @xmath24 constitutes a superposition of plane waves ( see @xcite ) . at an earlier era @xmath25",
    "the solution for the gravitational waves taken the form @xmath26 denotes the gravitational wave polarization tensor .",
    "there exist two types of polarization signals : the so called @xmath27 polarization which has positive parity , and @xmath28 polarization which is parity odd .",
    "scalar perturbations only produce @xmath27 polarization , while tensor perturbations , gravity waves , produce both , @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) . a typical cmb anisotropy and polarization spectrum as it is expected from inflationary models",
    "is shown in ( figure  [ figure_2 ] ) .",
    "the polarization tensor is defined as :    @xmath32    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the pauli matrices and @xmath36 are the stokes parameters .",
    "we now will see which is the relation between pgw and polarization of the cmb using the equation of radiative transport ( see @xcite ) . by definition :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 corresponding to unpolarized isotropic thermal radiation , with @xmath40 -1\\right)$ ] , which depends only on the photon frequency and corresponds to the plank spectrum .",

    "the perturbed solution to this equation , linearized with respect to @xmath51 may be the equation  [ eq11 ] , where @xmath52 is a vector .",
    "if the fluctuations in cmb intensity are printed by scalar perturbations , one would only expect primordial e - modes in the cmb polarization .",
    "however , vector and tensor perturbations , like those due to gravitational waves in the primordial universe , are mechanisms that could generate primordial b - modes . in particular , the energy scale @xmath53 at which inflation occurred can be expressed in terms of @xmath54 , the ratio of tensor to scalar contributions to the power spectrum , as :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the amplitudes of scalar and primordial power spectrum and @xmath58 is the hubble parameter at inflation epoch ( @xcite ) .",

    "the e - mode pattern was first detected by the dasi experiment and others experiments have refined measurements of ee power spectrum as cbi , boomerang , wmap , polar , boom and quiet .",

    "the observed b - mode power spectrum by bicep2 instrument is well fit by a theoretical model with tensor - scalar ratio @xmath63 .",
    "however , after much debate in 2013 , where it was thought he had been achieved pgw detection , the bicep2+keck / planck teams show results with dust foreground subtraction based on measurement of cross - power between planck and keck collaborations , has found no conclusive evidence of primordial gravitational waves .",
