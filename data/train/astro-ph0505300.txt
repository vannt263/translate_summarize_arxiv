    "more than forty years after its discovery , the nature of the x - ray background emission is still debated .",
    "about 80% of the background at low energies ( @xmath0 kev ) has been resolved into point sources @xcite . above 4",
    "kev the situation is less clear , especially above 10 kev , where only a small fraction of the x - ray background has been resolved @xcite . since obscured agn have a hard x - ray spectrum",
    " harder than the typical unobscured agn  they can be used to explain the observed spectrum of the x - ray background at energies from a few to @xmath1 kev @xcite .",
    "early attempts to explain the x - ray background emission using agn population synthesis models @xcite needed to assume a changing ratio of obscured to unobscured agn with redshift and/or luminosity .",
    "however , recent observational evidence @xcite suggests that this ratio is constant with redshift .",
    "more recent calculations @xcite also assumed a constant obscured - to - unobscured agn ratio with redshift ; however , @xcite assumed that this ratio changes with luminosity , while @xcite assumed different luminosity functions for obscured and unobscured agn .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the previously reported dependence of this ratio with luminosity , more obscured agn at lower luminosities , can arise naturally from selection effects , for samples extending to high redshift .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented a much larger and highly complete sample of x - ray selected agn in which this dependence is still observed at low redshifts .",
    "a general problem for these population synthesis models is the low redshift peak observed in x - ray selected agn samples in deep surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) , at @xmath2 , whereas the models predict a peak at @xmath3 , similar to optical quasar surveys @xcite .",
    "another problem is the discrepancy between the observed and predicted ratios of obscured to unobscured agn . while most models need a ratio of 4:1 or higher to make up the hard x - ray peak in the x - ray background spectrum , the observed ratio in the deep x - ray surveys based on spectroscopic identifications is closer to @xmath4 2:1 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "both problems were addressed by @xcite , who showed that a simple agn unification model with constant ratio of 3:1 could account for the multiwavelength observations of hard x - ray selected agn sample in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; @xcite ) fields .    here",
    "we verify that population synthesis using agn unification models with co - evolving populations of obscured and unobscured agn can reproduce the x - ray background spectral shape and intensity in the 1100  kev energy range .",
    "this is true for both the simplest agn unification model , in which the obscured - to - unobscured ratio is constant with luminosity and redshift , and for a modified unification model in which this ratio changes with luminosity .",
    "we also predict the agn number counts in the hard x - ray 10 - 100 kev band , which will be observed by future missions like the `` black hole finder '' einstein probe . specifically , exist @xcite will see as many as 20,000 agn in all - sky observations , while pointed missions like nustar @xcite will see several hundred agn per square degree , depending on the final spatial resolution ( @xmath5 sources deg@xmath6 at @xmath7  erg  cm@xmath6s@xmath9 )",
    ". these hard x - ray missions will have the sensitivity to detect all the active supermassive black holes out to high redshifts , and the most luminous agn at any redshift , allowing for the determination of black hole demographics throughout the universe .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath10  kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the simplest agn unification model assumes that dust and gas surrounds the central engine in a toroidal geometry , which dictates the distribution of @xmath13 column density along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite developed a family of self - consistent agn spectra for this model , as a function of orientation and intrinsic hard x - ray luminosity , from which they calculated the expected agn number counts in optical and x - ray bands .",
    "here we sum the x - ray spectra of agn , modified appropriately by absorption , and compare to the observed x - ray background .",
    "although the distribution of @xmath13 is actually continuous , we define  obscured \" and  unobscured \" agn as those with @xmath13 greater than and less than @xmath14  cm@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "extensive details of the model assumptions are given by @xcite and the parameters used are discussed below .",
    "agn x - ray emission above 2 kev can be well represented by an attenuated power law of the form :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the number of photons with energy @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the power - law photon index ; @xmath19 represents the cross section for photoelectric absorption of soft x - rays , given by @xcite assuming solar abundance of metals ; @xmath13 is the neutral hydrogen column density along the line of sight ; and @xmath20 is the cutoff energy . in this work",
    "we assume typical values for the intrinsic power law slope , @xmath21 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the cutoff energy , @xmath22  kev @xcite . later",
    "we explore the effects of changing these parameters (  2.3 ) .    at hard x - ray energies ( @xmath23kev )",
    ", the contribution to agn spectra from emission reprocessed by the accretion disk is significant . to account for this emission we used the compton reflection models of @xcite assuming solar abundance of metals , a 2 times solar iron abundance and an average inclination angle with respect to the line of sight of @xmath24",
    "; we verified that this angle gives a spectrum very similar to the average spectrum over all angles .",
    "the assumed iron abundance is consistent with observations of local agn , where values of 1 - 2 times solar are commonly found @xcite , and values as high as @xmath25 solar have been measured @xcite .",
    "we note that for energies below the peak of the x - ray background , @xmath26  kev , a power law spectrum with @xmath27 is very similar to a spectrum with @xmath21 plus a reflection component @xcite .      for this work we use the hard x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) agn luminosity function and evolution of @xcite , which is based on a compilation of asca , heao-1 and @xmath28 observations .",
    "recently , a new hard x - ray luminosity function was presented by @xcite , based on a much larger sample ; however , because an analytical fit of the luminosity function is given only for low redshifts ( @xmath29 ) , we use the @xcite in this work .",
    "( in any case , high - redshift luminosity functions at @xmath30 are not that well - determined , so the analytic fit is necessarily uncertain . )",
    "we note that in the redshift range over which agn contribute significantly to the x - ray background , @xmath31 , the luminosity functions of @xcite and @xcite are very similar , so the choice of luminosity function should not affect our results for the synthesized x - ray background .",
    "a key new feature of the @xcite luminosity function is the luminosity - dependent density evolution , in which low luminosity agn peak at lower redshift than high luminosity sources .",
    "similar evolution has been seen in optical quasar surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) ; in that case , the observed redshift distribution actually peaks at high redshift , @xmath3 , because those surveys are sensitive only to high luminosity agn .",
    "in contrast , deep x - ray selected samples include low luminosity agn , and those with small area , such as the chandra deep fields , actually exclude high luminosity agn because of the limited volume sampled .    to calculate the number of agn as a function of @xmath13 we assume a simple dust torus in which the geometrical parameters give an obscured to unobscured agn ratio of @xmath4 3:1 @xcite , consistent with observations of agn in the local universe @xcite . in order to account for the presence of compton - thick sources we increased the equatorial column density of @xcite from @xmath32  cm@xmath6 to @xmath33  cm@xmath6 .",
    "this does not affect observations at energies lower than 10 kev so it has no effect on the results presented by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite luminosity function is based on compton - thin agn , and so the normalization applies to agn with @xmath34  @xmath35 ; the number of additional compton - thick agn is then given by the @xmath13 distribution .",
    "this adds @xmath36 more agn to the original sample of @xcite , none of which would be detected in even the deepest @xmath28 observations .",
    "[ nh ] shows that the @xmath13 distribution observed for the x - ray sources in the goods fields @xcite agrees well with the predictions of the dusty torus model for the goods flux limit ( @xmath37  erg  cm@xmath6s@xmath9 ) , particularly considering the uncertainties in the @xmath13 determination for the observed sample and the fact that none of the parameters in the model were adjusted to obtain a better fit to the observations .",
    "the only exception is that the number of observed sources in the @xmath38cm@xmath6 @xmath13 bin is significantly higher than the predicted value .",
    "this is because some sources will have soft x - ray excesses , in which case our conversion of observed hardness ratio into @xmath13 using a simple power law will significantly underestimate the amount of absorption present in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "although in this calculation there are many parameters , the vast majority are fixed by observations .",
    "eight ( fixed ) parameters describe the luminosity function and evolution .",
    "the ratio of obscured to unobscured agn is fixed by the locally observed value ; when modified as a function of luminosity , two more parameters are added ( the luminosity range over which the percentage of obscured agn is allowed to vary from 0 to 100% ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath13 is constrained so that the equatorial value is @xmath39  cm@xmath6 , since compton - thick agn are observed locally .",
    "the remaining parameters describe the x - ray spectrum , and only two of these were adjusted to fit the observed x - ray background , namely the universal cutoff energy , @xmath20 , and the iron abundance .",
    "the choice of cutoff energy is relevant for @xmath40  kev , while the iron abundance affects the emission in the @xmath41 region , so the two parameters can be determined independently .",
    "we chose the highest cutoff energy that does not overproduce the observed x - ray background at @xmath42  kev , namely , @xmath22  kev , and we chose the minimum iron abundance needed to produce the absorption edge at @xmath43  kev while not overproducing the total emission around that energy . in both cases ,",
    "the assumed values are in good agreement with observations of individual agn , and so can not be adjusted arbitrarily . roughly speaking ,",
    "acceptable fits can be obtained for 200 kev@xmath44  kev and iron abundances in the range @xmath45 solar .",
    "the simplest unified agn model we consider has a fixed 3:1 ratio of obscured to unobscured agn , independent of redshift or luminosity .",
    "we calculate the total x - ray emission from the agn population , integrating over luminosities @xmath46  erg  s@xmath47  erg  s@xmath9 , redshifts @xmath48 , and columns densities @xmath38  @xmath49  cm@xmath6 .",
    "sources with @xmath50  erg  s@xmath9 or @xmath51 do not contribute significantly to the x - ray background @xcite . for sources with @xmath52  cm@xmath6 , the large amount of obscuration blocks almost all the primary emission and makes their total contribution to the x - ray background negligible @xcite .",
    "the contribution of galaxy clusters in the soft x - ray region ( @xmath53  kev ) was added following the prescription of @xcite ; this component is relevant only for very low energies , @xmath54  kev , and even then is only @xmath55% of the total x - ray background emission . the predicted x - ray background spectrum using this model",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ xrb ] .",
    "we compare these predictions with heao-1 observations of the x - ray background compiled by @xcite .",
    "more recent observations at 2 - 10  kev using xmm @xcite agree in shape but have 40% higher normalization than the heao-1 data @xcite .",
    "this higher value of the x - ray background intensity was observed also in other missions like bepposax @xcite and asca @xcite . while a full reanalysis of the @xcite heao-1 data is beyond the scope of this paper",
    ", we adopt a value of the normalization that is 40% higher than the original heao-1 data in order to match the xmm data , a procedure followed by other authors previously ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "consequences of this assumption have been discussed by other authors .",
    "for example , @xcite concluded that if the higher normalization is assumed there is very good agreement between the xrb intensity and the number of resolved sources in deep chandra observations .",
    "if instead the xrb intensity at high energies is lower , this will reduce the number of obscured and/or compton - thick agn needed to explain the observations .    in figure  [ xrb ]",
    "our simple population synthesis model is compared to the observed data points and an analytic fit from @xcite .",
    "the agreement between predictions and observations is remarkably good especially given the low number of free parameters in the calculation ; the @xmath56 per degree of freedom for @xmath57  kev is 0.794 .",
    "the residuals are very small below @xmath58  kev ; at higher energies , unresolved blazars ( not included here ) become dominant ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there is a small discrepancy at @xmath59  kev , @xmath60 , which can be greatly reduced by adding a few ( @xmath61 ) obscured agn with super - solar iron abundances ( which makes the reflection component peak at higher energies ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , given the low significance of this discrepancy and the _ ad hoc _ nature of the solution , we did not add these sources to our model .",
    "this is the first time the x - ray background has been well fitted by a model fully consistent with the simplest agn unification paradigm , i.e. , with a constant ratio of obscured to unobscured agn , independent of intrinsic luminosity or redshift . as shown by the thin solid lines on fig .",
    "[ xrb ] , unobscured agn dominate the energy budget in the soft x - ray regime ( @xmath62 kev ) while obscured agn clearly dominate at higher energies .",
    "a similar conclusion was presented by @xcite using a detailed analysis of the agn number counts in the chandra deep fields .",
    "an apparent dependence of the obscured to unobscured agn ratio with luminosity has been reported @xcite .",
    "one interpretation is that the torus is evaporated by radiation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xcite population synthesis model for the x - ray background differs from the calculation above because it assumes that there are relatively more obscured agn at lower luminosities .",
    "@xcite showed that this observed trend with luminosity could be explained as a selection effect , whereby high - redshift obscured agn are too faint for optical spectroscopy and thus do not have known redshifts or luminosities .",
    "this also can explain the low peak in the redshift distribution in deep surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have recently reported this dependence of ratio on luminosity still pertains at low redshift , where selection effects are not important @xcite .",
    "( this is the first time a sample has been large enough to determine obscured - to - unobscured ratio as a function of luminosity at low redshift . )",

    "the agreement between the modified model and observations is good up to @xmath70 . at higher redshifts",
    "an apparent increase in the unobscured - to - total ratio with redshift is observed , contrary to the predictions of both our simple and modified models .",
    "however , this may be due to the difficulty of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for obscured agn at @xmath63 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we considered whether the effects of incompleteness in this sample could explain the apparent discrepancy .",
    "the unidentified sources could be either obscured or unobscured agn ; we looked at the limits on the data obtained by assigning all the unidentified sources to either obscured or unobscured sources .",
