    "in a recent work @xcite it has been proposed a systematic analytical method for the investigation of the statistical properties of a coherent structure interacting with turbulent field .",
    "the method is here developed in detail and new possible applications or developments arise .",
    "the nonlinearity of the dynamical equations of fluids and plasma is the determining factor in the behaviour of these systems .",
    "the current manifestation is the generation , from almost all initial conditions , of turbulent states , with an irregular aspect of fluctuations implying a wide range of space and time scales .",
    "the fluctuations seem to be random and a statistical characterization of the fluctuating fields is appropriate .",
    "however it is known both from theory and experiment that the same fields can have , in particular situations , stable and regular forms which can be identified as coherent structures , for example solitons and vortices . for most general conditions",
    "one should expect that these aspects are both present and this requires to study the mixed state consisting of coherent structures and homogeneous turbulence .",
    "numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamics show that in general cases a coherent structure emerges in a turbulent plasma , it moves while deforming due to the interactions with the random fields around it and eventually is destroyed . in plasma turbulence",
    "a coherent structure is build up by the inverse spectral cascade or by merging and coalescence of small - scale structures @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity of the equations for the drift waves in a non - uniform , magnetized plasma permits the formation of solitary waves in addition to the usual small - amplitude dispersive modes .",
    "the convective nonlinearity ( of the poisson bracket type ) , can lead to _ low - frequency convective structures _ in magnetized plasma @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the structures are not solitons in the strict sense but are very robust .",
    "it is even possible that the state of plasma turbulence can be represented as a superposition of coherent vortex structures ( generated by a self - organization process ) and weakly correlated turbulent fluctuations .",
    "naturally , the coherent structures influences the statistical properties of the fields ( the correlations ) , in particular the spectrum . in this context",
    "it is usual to say that the deviation of the correlations of the fluctuating fields from the gaussian statistics is associated with the presence of the coherent structures and it is named _",
    "intermittency_. numerical simulations @xcite of the @xmath0-dimensional navier - stokes fluid turbulence have shown coherent structures evolving from random initial conditions and in general energy spectra steeper than @xmath1 have been atributed to intermittency ( patchy , spatial intermittent paterns ) .",
    "these coherent structures are long - lived and disappear only by coalescence , the latter being manifested as spatial intermittency . in these studies",
    "it was underlined that the coherent structures have effects which can not be predicted by closure methods applied to mode - coupling hyerarchies of equations .",
    "the difficulty of the analytical description consists in the absence from theory of well established technical methods to investigate the plasma turbulence in the presence of coherent structures .",
    "while for the instability - induced turbulence ( via nonlinear mode - coupling ) systematic renormalization procedures have been developed , the problem of the simultaneous presence of coherent structures and drift turbulence has not received a comparable detailed description .    in the recently proposed method @xcite , the starting point is the observation that the coherent structure and the drift waves , although very different in form , are similar from a particular point of view : the first realizes the extremum and the later is very close to the extremum of the action functional that describes the evolution of the plasma .",
    "the analytical framework is developed such as to exploit this feature and is based on results from well established theories : the functional statistical study of the properties of the classical stochastic dynamical systems ( in the martin - siggia - rose approach ) ; the perturbed inverse scattering transform method , allowing to calculate the field of perturbed nonlinear coherent structures ; the semi - classical approximation in the study of the quantum particle motion in multiple minima potentials .",
    "the dilute gas of plasma solitons has been studied by meiss and horton @xcite who assumed a probability density function of the amplitudes characteristic of the gibbs ensemble .",
    "we analyse the same nonlinear equation but take into account the drift wave turbulence .",
    "a brief discussion on the closure methods developed in the study of drift wave turbulence provides us the argumentation for the need of a different approach ( section 2 ) .",
    "the section 3 contains a description of the general lines of the method proposed .",
    "a more technical presentation of the calculation is given in the subsection 3.2 .",
    "the particular case of the drift wave equation is developed in detail in the section 4 and in the section 5 the explicit expression of the generating functional is used for the calculation of the correlation functions .",
    "the results and the conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "some details of calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "we consider the plasma confined in a strong magnetic field and the drift wave electric potential in the transversal plane @xmath2 where @xmath3 corresponds to the poloidal direction and @xmath4 to the radial one in a tokamak .",
    "we shall work with the radially symmetric flierl - petviashvili soliton equation @xcite studied in ref.@xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and the potential is scaled as @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the gradient lengths of the density and temperature .",
    "the velocity is the diamagnetic velocity @xmath11 .",
    "the condition for the validity of this equation is : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "the exact solution of the equation is @xmath14   \\label{eqh7}\\ ] ] where the velocity is restricted to the intervals @xmath15  or  @xmath16 .",
    "the function is represented in fig.1 . in the ref .",
    "@xcite the radial extension of the solution is estimated as : @xmath17 . in our work",
    "we shall assume that @xmath18 is very close to @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( i.e. the solitons have small amplitudes ) .",
    "the nonlinear equations for the drift waves are known to generate as solutions irregular turbulent fields but also exact coherent structures of the type ( [ eqh7 ] ) , depending on the initial conditions .",
    "typical statistical quantities are the correlations , like : @xmath21 , where for the homogeneous turbulence the exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 are calculated by the theory of renormalization or by spectral balance equations , using closure methods ( @xcite ) .",
    "various closure methods have been developed as perturbations around gaussianity and they are valid for small deviation from the gaussian statistics @xcite .",
    "we see intuitively that this approach can not be extended to the description of the coherent structures .",
    "this can also be seen in more analytical terms .",
    "a quantity which is unavoidable in the calculation of the correlations is the average of the exponential of a functional of the fluctuating field , consider simply @xmath24 ( for example in the inverse of the vlasov operator , using the fourier transformation , the potential appears in the formal expression of the trajectory , i.e. at the exponent ) .",
    "this quantity can be written schematically as @xcite : @xmath25   \\label{cumulant}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 represents the cumulant of order @xmath27 ( i.e. the irreducible part of the correlation , after substracting the combinations of the lower order cumulants ) . for a gaussian statistics the first two cumulants are different of zero ( @xmath28 : average and @xmath29 : dispersion )",
    ", all others are zero .",
    "non - vanishing of the higher order cumulants is the signature of non - gaussian statistics . in the perturbative renormalization",
    "we assume slight deviation from gaussianity , i.e. small absolute values of the next order cumulants ( e.g. the kurtosis must be close to @xmath30 , the gaussian value ) and vanishing of the higher order cumulants .",
    "this assumption is obviously invalid in the case of coherent structures .",
    "the field of a coherent structure has long range , persistent correlations imposed by its regular geometry , which naturally requires non - vanishing very large order cumulants ( _ i.e. _ many terms in the sum at the exponent in eq.([cumulant ] ) ) and excludes any perturbative expansion .    in particular , the closure of the nonlinear equation for the two - point correlation ( based on the retaining the directly interacting triplet ) can account for the small scale correlations related to the space - dependent relative diffusion , i.e. the clump effect ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but the spectrum obtained in this framework can not account for the possible existence of the coherent structures .",
    "this clearly suggests that we must find a different approach .",
    "we present the basic lines of an approach which can provide a statistical description of the coherent structure in a turbulent background .",
    "the physical origin of this approach is the observation that the non - linear equation whose solution is the coherent structure ( the vortex soliton ) also has classical drift waves as solutions , in the case of very weak nonlinearity . in a certain sense ( which will become more clear further on ) ,",
    "the vortex soliton and the drift waves belong to the same family of dynamical configurations of the plasma .",
    "our approach , which is designed to put in evidence and to exploit this property , consists of the following steps .",
    "we start by constructing the action functional of the system .",
    "the dynamical equation is the euler - lagrange equation derived from the condition of extremum of this functional and the exact solution is the vortex soliton ( [ eqh7 ] ) .    by using the exponential of the action",
    "we construct the generating functional of the irreducible correlations of @xmath31 .",
    "this functional contains all the information on the coherent structure and the drift turbulence .",
    "the correlations are obtained via functional differentiations .",
    "this requires the formal introduction of a perturbation of the system , through the interaction with an external current . throughout the work , this perturbation",
    "will be considered a small quantity and finally it will be taken zero .    the generating functional is by definition a functional integral over all possible configurations of the system and this integral must be calculated explicitely .",
    "the simplest thing to do is to determine the configuration of the system ( with space and time dependence ) which extremises the action , by equating the first functional variation of the action with zero and solving this equation : this will give the vortex soliton ( modified due to the small interaction term ) .",
    "then one should replace this solution in the expression of the action .",
    "this is the lowest approximation and it does not contain anything related to the drift wave trubulence .    at this point we can benefit of the particular physics of the drift waves .",
    "the vortex soliton is the exact solution of the fully nonlinear equation and is a localized potential perturbation with regular , cylindrical symmetric form .",
    "the linear drift waves are harmonic potential perturbations propagating with constant velocity ( the diamagnetic velocity in the case of the drift poloidal propagation in tokamak ) .",
    "although the drift waves have very different geometry they are solutions of the same equation as the vortex , but for negligible magnitude of the nonlinear term .",
    "the drift waves do not exactly realize the extremum of the action functional , but obtain an action very close to this extremum .",
    "this means that the drift waves and the vortex soliton are close in the function space in the sense of the measure defined by the exponential of the action .",
    "in other terms the drift waves are in a functional neighbourhood of the vortex ( for this measure ) .",
    "this suggests to perform the functional integral with better approximation , which means to perform the integration over a functional neighbourhood of the vortex solution .",
    "this will automatically include the drift waves in the generating functional of correlation which so will contain information on both the coherent structure and the drift waves .",
    "the function space neighbourhood over which the functional integration is extended is limited by the measure ( exponential of the action ) which severly penalizes all configurations of the system which are far from the solution realizing the extremum ( i.e. the vortex soliton ) . as in any stationary phase method",
    "there are oscillations which strongly suppress the contribution of the configurations which are far ( in the sense of the measure ) from the soliton . in practice",
    "we shall expand the action in a functional taylor series around the soliton solution and keep the term with the second functional derivative .    in this perspective",
    "the drift waves appear as fluctuations around the soliton solution .",
    "this is compatible with the numerical simulations which show that the vortices are accompagned by a tail of drift waves . during the interaction of the vortices linear drift waves",
    "are `` radiated '' @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the analytical treatment of the perturbed vortex solution by the perturbed inverse scattering transform shows similar tail of perturbed field , following the soliton .",
    "this strengthens our argument that integrating close to the vortex means to include the drift waves in the generating functional .",
    "the functional integral can be performed exactly and we determine the generating functional of the potential correlations .",
    "we shall calculate the two - point correlation by performing double functional derivative at the external current .",
    "the analytical framework is similar to the model of quantum fluctuations around the instanton solution in the semi - classical calculation of the transition amplitude for the particle in a two - well potential ( see reference @xcite ) .",
    "let us write formally the equation for a nonlinear plasma waves as @xmath32 where the field @xmath33 represents the `` field '' ( coherent structure + drift waves ) and the operator @xmath34 is the nonlinear operator of the equation ( [ eqh1 ] ) .",
    "this equation should be derived from the condition of extremum of an action functional which must reflect the statistical nature of our problem .",
    "the field @xmath31 obeys a purely deterministic equation , but the randomness of the initial conditions generates a statistical ensemble of realizations of the system evolutions ( space - time configurations ) .",
    "we shall follow the martin - siggia - rose method of constructing the action functional but in the path - integral formalism , for which we give in the following a very short description ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "first , we consider a formal extension from the statistical ensemble of realizations of the system s space - time configurations to a larger space of functions which may include even non - physical configurations . every function is discretized in space and time , so it will be represented as a collection of varables @xmath35 , each attached to the corresponding space - time point @xmath36 . in this space of functions ,",
    "the selection of the configurations which correspond to the physical ones ( solutions of the equation of motion ) is performed through the identification with dirac delta - functions , in every space - time point @xmath37 \\delta \\left [ \\widehat{{\\it o}}\\varphi \\right ]   \\label{qcd2}\\ ] ] and integration over all possible functions @xmath38_i.e .",
    "_ over the ensemble of independent variables @xmath35",
    ". using the fourier representation for every @xmath39 function we get @xmath40 \\label{qcd3}\\ ] ] going to the continuum limit , a new function appears , @xmath41 which is similar to the fourier conjugate of @xmath31 . the generating functional of the correlation functions is @xmath42 \\,d\\left [ \\chi \\left ( { \\bf x,}t\\right ) \\right ] \\exp \\left\\ { i\\int d{\\bf x}^{\\prime } dt^{\\prime } \\chi \\left ( { \\bf x}^{\\prime } , t^{\\prime } \\right ) \\widehat{{\\it o% } } \\varphi \\left ( { \\bf x}^{\\prime } , t^{\\prime } \\right ) \\right\\ }   \\label{qcd4}\\ ] ] where the functional measures have been introduced and @xmath43 .",
    "the random initial conditions @xmath44 can be included by a dirac @xmath39 functional : @xmath45 . as explained in @xcite , instead of this exact treatment ( accessible only numerically )",
    "we exploit the particularity of our approach , _",
    "i.e. _ the connection between the functional integration and the delimitation of the statistical ensemble : the way we perform the functional integration is an implicit choice of the statistical ensemble .",
    "we choose to build implicitely the statistical ensemble , collecting all configurations which have the same type of deformations ( given in our formulas by @xmath46 ) .",
    "all these configurations belong to the neighbourhood of the extremum in function space and we take them into account , by performing the integration over this space . in doing",
    "so we assume that the ensemble of perturbed configurations induced by an `` external '' excitation ( @xmath47 below ) of the system is the same as the statistical ensemble of the system s configurations evolving from random initial conditions .",
    "we must add to the expression in the integrand at the exponential a linear combination related to the interaction of the fields @xmath31 and @xmath48 with external currents @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath51 \\,d\\left [ \\chi \\left ( { \\bf x,}t\\right ) \\right ] \\exp \\left\\ { is_j\\right\\ }   \\label{qcd5 } \\\\ s_j & \\equiv & \\int d{\\bf x}^{\\prime } dt^{\\prime } \\left [ \\chi \\left ( { \\bf x}% ^{\\prime } , t^{\\prime } \\right ) \\widehat{{\\it o}}\\varphi \\left ( { \\bf x}% ^{\\prime } , t^{\\prime } \\right ) + j_\\varphi \\varphi + j_\\chi \\chi \\right ]   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is now possible to obtain correlations by functional differentiation , for example @xmath52    for the explicit calculation of the generating functional we need the functions @xmath31 and @xmath48 which extremize the action @xmath53      in the absence of the current @xmath54 the equations ( [ deltas ] ) have as solutions for @xmath31 the nonlinear solitons ( vortices ) @xcite , @xcite . more generally , the basic solution of the kdv equation ( on which the flierl - petviashvili equation can be mapped ) is the periodic cnoidal function which becomes , when the modulus of the elliptic function is close to @xmath55 , the soliton . when the distance between the centres of the solitons is much larger than their spatial extension ( dilute gas )",
    "the general solution can be written as a superposition of individual solitons , with different velocities and different positions @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we shall consider in this work a single vortex soliton and in the last section we shall comment on the extension of the method to many solitons .",
    "the position of the centre of the soliton rises the difficult problem of the _ zero modes _",
    "@xcite . except for a brief comment about the relation of the zero modes with the gaussian functional integration ( see below ) , we shall avoid this problem and postpone the discussion of this topic to a future work .    in the presence of the external current @xmath54 ,",
    "the equations resulting from the extremization of the action @xmath56 become inhomogeneous , and the solutions are _ perturbed _ solitons .",
    "this point is technically non - trivial and we shall use the results obtained by karpman @xcite who considered the inverse scattering transform method applied to the perturbed soliton equation .",
    "we find the approximate solution @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the inhomogeneous equations ( i.e. including the external current @xmath54 ) .",
    "the result depends on the currents @xmath47 , and this will permit us to perform functional differentiations in order to calculate the correlation , as shown in eq.([deffifi ] ) .",
    "as a first step in obtaining the explicit form of @xmath59 , the perturbed soliton solutions depending on @xmath54 must be introduced in the expression of the action @xmath56 .",
    "after that we perform the expansion of the functions @xmath31 and @xmath48 around the coherent solution , @xmath60 this gives @xmath61 d% \\left [ \\delta \\chi \\right ] \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\times \\exp \\left\\ { \\int d{\\bf x}^{\\prime } dt^{\\prime } \\;\\delta \\chi \\left ( { \\bf x}^{\\prime } , t^{\\prime } \\right ) \\,\\left ( \\left .   \\frac{\\delta",

    "the determinant is calculated using the eigenvalues @xmath63 and @xmath64    since the action is invariant to the arbitrary position of the centre of the soliton there are directions in the function space where the fluctuations are not bounded and in particular are not gaussian .",
    "this requires the introduction of a set of collective coordinates and after a change of variables the functional integrations along those particular directions are replaced by usual integrations over the colective variables , with inclusion of jacobian factors .",
    "the zero eigenvalues of the determinant ( corresponding to the _ zero modes _ ) are excluded in this way .",
    "we shall avoid this complicated problem and assume a given position for the centre of the vortex .",
    "in order to adimensionalize the equation ( [ eqh1 ] ) we introduce the space and time scales @xmath65 and @xmath66 and the equation becomes @xmath67 for simplicity of notation we keep the symbol @xmath68 for the adimensional velocity @xmath69 .",

    "the functionally conjugated ( `` regressive '' ) function @xmath48 is at @xmath72 a collection of vortices and drift wave turbulence which evolving backward in time , toward @xmath73 , coalesce and build up into a single perturbation , the same as the initial condition of @xmath31 .",
    "we can restrict our analysis to the time range where the two functions has similar patterns ( but opposite ) which simply means to chose the time interval far from the initial and asymptotic limits . as shown by analytical and numerical studies ,",

    "the terms are calculated numerically using the detailed expressions of @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath46 and @xmath227 .",
    "the first term reproduces the self - correlation of the soliton and represents the connection with the results of ref.@xcite , with our particular simplifications : single soliton and fixed ( non - random ) position of its centre . as can easily be seen , the first order functional derivatives of @xmath228 to the current @xmath47 reduce to the function @xmath225 calculated in the corresponding points . the term with the double functional derivative of the action represents the contribution to the self - correlation of the soliton due to a statistical ensemble of initial conditions , without drift waves .",
    "all mixed terms ( _ i.e. _ containing both the action and one of the factors @xmath229 or @xmath230 ) represent interaction between the perturbed soliton and the drift waves . the terms containing exclusively the factors @xmath229 and/or @xmath230 refers to the drift waves _ in the presence _ of the perturbed soliton .",
    "the formulas obtained by functional differentiation of the generating functional are complicated and a numerical calculation is necessary .",
    "we chose a particular value of the soliton velocity ( which also fixes its amplitude ) : @xmath231 and let the variables @xmath232 and @xmath233 sample the one - dimensional volume of length @xmath234 .",
    "the physical parameters are chosen such that @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "we recall that there are two particular symmetry limitations of our calculation .",
    "( 1 ) the soliton centre is assumed fixed ( at @xmath155 ) , especially for avoiding the complicated problem of the _ zero modes_. ( 2 ) due to the asymmetry of the perturbed soliton tail the terms which results from the functional differentiation are also asymmetric .",
    "these are only limitations of our calculation and in no way reflect the reality of a isotropic motion of many solitons in a real turbulent plasma . in order to see to what extent our result can be useful for understatnding the ( much more complicated ) real situation we will symmetrize these terms in the unique mode which is accessible to our one - dimensional calculation , i.e. take into account the mixing of perturbed solitons moving in the two directions on the line .",
    "the amplitude of the modifications of the soliton depends on a parameter which is the average time of interaction with the perturbation .",
    "this average time is comparable with the time required to cross @xmath237 at a speed of @xmath68 and is limited since the growth of the perturbation can not exceed the soliton itself .",
    "the figures _ are conventional representations of functions of two variables _ @xmath238 ; they do not correspond to a two - dimensional geometry .",
    "for this reason it is not expected to have _ circular _ *  * symmetry .",
    "the contributions to the correlation from the last two factors in eq.([cor7 ] ) have amplitudes similar or less by a factor of few units , compared to the pure soliton .",
    "the factors coming from `` internal '' part are peaked and localized on the soliton extension while the `` external '' part gives terms oscillating on @xmath239 . in wavenumber space , there are contributions to both low-@xmath240 and high-@xmath240 regions .",
    "the spectrum of an unperturbed soliton is smooth and monotonously decreasing from the peak value at @xmath241 .",
    "fig.5 shows much more structure .",
    "in the low-@xmath240 part there are many local peaks , an effective manifestation of the periodic character of the terms ( as shown by ( [ oper38 ] ) ) .",
    "this arises from the discrete nature of the eigenvalues , which is induced by the second order differential operator and the vanishing of the eigenmodes at the positions of the singularities @xmath242 .",
    "the singularities are generated by the vanishing of the norm of the operator @xmath243 , which makes ambiguous the assumption of propagating wave character , @xmath244 .",
    "the large-@xmath240 part mainly reflects the structure of the small - scale shape perturbation of the soliton , comming from @xmath207-related terms .",
    "fig.6 is an @xmath245 spectrum obtained from @xmath246 and repeating the calculations for various soliton velocities @xmath247 .",
    "although we can not afford high @xmath248 since the expressions of @xmath249 depend on the assumption @xmath20 , we remark local peaks in contrast to the `` pure soliton '' result of ref.@xcite .    for simplicity we have assumed a single soliton .",
    "however the calculation can be readily extended to the multi - soliton case , considering instead of ( [ fijs ] ) and ( [ hijs ] ) sums over many individual soliton solutions with different velocities and positions of the centres .",
    "these sums replace the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the expressions of the operators @xmath243 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "if the velocities are all greater but not too different of @xmath19 the change of variables to the referential moving with @xmath19 ( described in the paragraph below eq.([oper12 ] ) ) will leave a very slow time variation which eventually may be treated perturbatively .",
    "many solitons will also generate many singularities arising from the vanishing of the function @xmath153 , and this will factorize the space of functions and correspondingly the generating functional .",
    "it will become however possible to consider random positions and random velocities and average them with distribution functions for the gibbs ensemble , like in @xcite .",
    "this is very simple with the first term of ( [ cor7 ] ) , which should be compared directly with ref.@xcite , but technically very difficult with the terms involving functional derivatives of @xmath229 and/or @xmath230 .",
    "the first results suggests that the non - gaussianity at the plasma edge can be explained by the presence of coherent structures .",
    "the contribution of avalanches to the deviation from the gaussian statistics can not be excluded but , as shown for self - organized systems @xcite , they have a scaling which should be easy recognized , at least in frequency domain .",
    "in conclusion we have developed an approach which allows us to calculate the statistical properties of a coherent structure in a turbulent background .",
    "compared to the standard renormalization , this approach is at the opposite limit in what concerns the relation `` coherent structure / wave turbulence '' , highlightning the coherent structure .",
    "however it offers comparatively greater possibilities for the extension of this studies to the more realistic problem of cascading wave turbulence mixed with rising and decaying coherent structures .",
