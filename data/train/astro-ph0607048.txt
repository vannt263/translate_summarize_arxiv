    "this problem has important cosmological aspect , if these particles are stable",
    ". then they should be present in the universe along with normal baryonic matter .",
    "various new weakly interacting massive species , and especially , neutral majorana fermions ( like neutralino from supersymmetric models ) are widely considered as candidates for the cosmological dark matter . here",
    "we discuss an alternative approach , involving heavy charged constituents of composite dark matter .",
    "recently at least three elementary particle frames for heavy stable charged particles were considered : ( a ) a heavy quark and heavy neutral lepton ( neutrino with mass above half the z - boson mass ) of fourth generation @xcite ; which can avoid experimental constraints @xcite and form composite dark matter species @xcite ; ( b ) a glashow s `` sinister '' heavy tera - quark @xmath2 and tera - electron @xmath3 , which can form a tower of tera - hadronic and tera - atomic bound states with `` tera - helium atoms '' @xmath4 considered as dominant dark matter @xcite . finally , ( c ) ac - leptons , predicted in the extension @xcite of standard model , based on the approach of almost - commutative geometry , @xcite can form evanescent ac - atoms , playing the role of dark matter @xcite .",
    "in all these models , predicting stable charged particles , the particles escape experimental discovery , because they are hidden in elusive atoms , maintaining dark matter of the modern universe .",
    "it offers new solution for the physical nature of the cosmological dark matter .",
    "this approach differs from the idea of dark matter , composed of primordial bound systems of superheavy charged particles and antiparticles , proposed earlier to explain the origin of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) @xcite . to survive to the present time and to be simultaneously the source of uhecr superheavy particles",
    "should satisfy a set of constraints , which in particular exclude the possibility that they possess gauge charges of the standard model .",
    "the particles , considered here , participate in the standard model interactions and we discuss the problems , related with various dark matter scenarios with composite atom - like systems , formed by heavy electrically charged stable particles .",
    "in glashow s `` sinister '' @xmath5 gauge model @xcite three heavy generations of tera - fermions are related with the light fermions by @xmath6 transformation linking light fermions to charge conjugates of their heavy partners and vice versa .",
    "@xmath6 symmetry breaking makes tera - fermions much heavier than their light partners .",
    "tera - fermion mass pattern is the same as for light generations , but all the masses are multiplied by the same factor @xmath7 .",

    "tera - fermions are sterile relative to @xmath9 electroweak interaction , and do not contribute into standard model parameters .",
    "in such realization the new heavy neutrinos ( @xmath10 ) acquire large masses and their mixing with light neutrinos @xmath11 provides a `` see - saw '' mechanism of light neutrino dirac mass generation . here in a sinister model",
    "the heavy neutrino is unstable . on the contrary in this scheme",
    "@xmath12 is the lightest heavy fermion and it is absolutely stable .",
    "since the lightest quark @xmath2 of heavy generation does not mix with quarks of 3 light generation , it can decay only to heavy generation leptons owing to gut - type interactions , what makes it sufficiently long living . if its lifetime exceeds the age of the universe , primordial @xmath2-quark hadrons as well as heavy leptons @xmath12 should be present in the modern matter .",
    "glashow s `` sinister '' scenario @xcite took into account that very heavy quarks @xmath13 ( or antiquarks @xmath14 ) can form bound states with other heavy quarks ( or antiquarks ) due to their coulomb - like qcd attraction , and the binding energy of these states substantially exceeds the binding energy of qcd confinement .",
    "then @xmath15 and @xmath16 baryons can exist .    according to @xcite primordial heavy quark @xmath2 and heavy electron @xmath3 are stable and",

    "the tera gas of such `` atoms '' seemed an ideal candidate for a very new and fascinating dark matter ; because of their peculiar wimp - like interaction with matter they might also rule the stages of gravitational clustering in early matter dominated epochs , creating first gravity seeds for galaxy formation .",
    "the ac - model @xcite appeared as realistic elementary particle model , based on the specific approach of @xcite to unify general relativity , quantum mechanics and gauge symmetry .",
    "this realization naturally embeds the standard model , both reproducing its gauge symmetry and higgs mechanism , but to be realistic , it should go beyond the standard model and offer candidates for dark matter .",
    "postulates of noncommutative geometry put severe constraints on the gauge symmetry group , excluding in this approach , which can be considered as alternative to superstring phenomenology , supersymmetric and gut extensions .",
    "the ac - model @xcite extends the fermion content of the standard model by two heavy particles with opposite electromagnetic and z - boson charges .",
    "having no other gauge charges of standard model , these particles ( ac - fermions ) behave as heavy stable leptons with charges @xmath18 and @xmath19 , called here @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "ac - fermions are sterile relative to @xmath9 electro - weak interaction , and do not contribute to the standard model parameters .",
    "the mass of ac - fermions is originated from noncommutative geometry of the internal space ( thus being much less than the planck scale ) and is not related to the higgs mechanism .",
    "the lower limit for this mass follows from absence of new chrged leptons in lep .",
    "it was assumed in @xcite that @xmath22 with free parameter @xmath23.in the absence of ac - fermion mixing with light fermions , ac - fermions can be absolutely stable .",
    "such absolute stability and absence of mixing with ordinary particles naturally follows from strict conservation of additional @xmath24 gauge charge , which is called @xmath25-charge and which only ac - leptons possess @xcite .    if ac - leptons @xmath20 and @xmath21 have equal and opposite sign @xmath25-charges , strict conservation of @xmath25-charge does not prevent generation of @xmath20 and @xmath21 excess , the excess of @xmath20 being equal to excess of @xmath21 .",

    "are important cosmological tracers of this process , the tera - lepton and tera - hadron relics from intermediate stages of a multi - step process of towards a final @xmath4 formation must survive with high abundance of _ visible _ relics in the present universe . to avoid this trouble an original idea of @xmath62 catalysis",
    "was proposed in @xcite : as soon as the temperature falls down below @xmath63 neutral @xmath62 atom with `` ionization potential '' @xmath64 can be formed .",
    "the hope was @xcite that this `` atom '' must catalyze additional effective binding of various tera - particle species and to reduce their abundance below the experimental upper limits .",
    "unfortunately , as it was shown in @xcite , this fascinating picture of sinister universe can not be realized .",
    "tracing in more details cosmological evolution of tera - matter and strictly following the conjecture of @xcite , the troubles of this approach were revealed and gracious exit from them for any model assuming -1 charge component of composite atom - like dark matter was found impossible .",
    "the model @xcite did nt offer any physical mechanism for generation of cosmological tera - baryon asymmetry and such asymmetry was postulated to saturate the observed dark matter density .",
    "this assumption was taken in @xcite and it was revealed that while the assumed tera - baryon asymmetry for @xmath2 washes out by annihilation primordial @xmath50 , the tera - lepton asymmetry of @xmath12 can not effectively suppress the abundance of tera - positrons @xmath65 in the earliest as well as in the late universe stages .",
    "this feature differs from successful annihilation of primordial antiprotons and positrons that takes place in our standard baryon asymmetrical universe .",
    "the abundance of @xmath50 and @xmath65 in earliest epochs exceeds the abundance of excessive @xmath2 and @xmath12 and it is suppressed ( successfully ) for @xmath50 only after qcd phase transition , while , there is no such effective annihilation mechanism for @xmath65 .",
    "thus the tera - lepton pair overproduction was revealed as the first trouble of sinister universe .",
    "moreover ordinary @xmath61he formed in standard big bang nucleosynthesis binds at @xmath66 virtually all the free @xmath12 into positively charged @xmath67 `` ion '' , which puts coulomb barrier for any successive @xmath68 annihilation or any effective @xmath69 binding .",
    "it happens _ before _ @xmath62 atom can be formed and @xmath62 atoms can not be formed , since all the free @xmath3 are already imprisoned by @xmath61he cage .",
    "it removed the hope @xcite on @xmath62 atomic catalysis as _ panacea _ from unwanted tera - particle species and became the second unresolvable trouble for the sinister universe .",
    "the huge frozen abundance of tera - leptons in hybrid tera - positronium @xmath70 and hybrid hydrogen - like tera - helium atom @xmath71 and in other complex anomalous isotopes can not be removed @xcite .",
    "their abundance is enormously high for known severe bounds on anomalous hydrogen .",
    "this is the grave nature of tera - lepton shadows over a sinister universe .    the remaining abundance of @xmath70 and @xmath72 exceeds by _ 27 orders _ of magnitude the terrestrial upper limit for anomalous hydrogen .",
    "there are also additional tera - hadronic anomalous relics , whose trace is constrained by the present data by _ 25.5 orders _ for @xmath73 and _ at least by 20 orders _ for @xmath74 respect to anomalous hydrogen ( @xmath75 relative to atom number density in earth ) , as well as by _ 14.5 orders _ for @xmath76 , by _ 10 orders _ for @xmath77 - respect to anomalous helium ( @xmath78 ) . while tera helium @xmath4 would co - exist with observational data , being a wonderful candidate for dark matter , its tera - lepton partners poison and forbid this opportunity",
    ".    the contradiction might be removed , if tera - fermions are unstable and drastically decay before the present time .",
    "but such solution excludes any cosmological sinister matter dominated universe , while , of course , it leaves still room and challenge for search for metastable @xmath3-leptons and @xmath2-hadrons in laboratories or in high energy cosmic ray traces .",
    "similar to the sinister universe , ac - lepton relics from intermediate stages of a multi - step process towards a final @xmath28 atom formation must survive with high abundance of _ visible _ relics in the present universe . in spite of the assumed excess of particles ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) abundance of frozen out antiparticles ( @xmath79 and",

    "as soon as @xmath82 is formed in big bang nucleosynthesis it captures all the free negatively charged heavy particles .",
    "if the charge of such particles is -1 ( as it was the case for tera - electron in @xcite ) positively charged ion @xmath83 puts coulomb barrier for any successive decrease of abundance of species , over - polluting by anomalous isotopes modern universe .",
    "this problem of unavoidable over - abundance of by - products of `` incomplete combustion '' is avoided in ac - model owing to the double negative charge of @xmath26 @xcite . instead of positively charged ion",
    "the primordial component of free anion - like ac - leptons @xmath26 are mostly trapped in the first three minutes into a puzzling neutral ole - helium state ( named so from _ _ o - le__pton- _ helium _ ) @xmath84 , with nuclear interaction cross section , which provides anywhere eventual later @xmath28 binding .",
    "as soon as ole - helium forms , it catalyzes in first three minutes effective binding in @xmath28 atoms and complete annihilation of antiparticles .",
    "products of annihilation cause undesirable effect neither in cmb spectrum , nor in light element abundances . due to early decoupling from relativistic plasma y - photon background is suppressed and its contribution to the total density in the period of big bang nucleosynthesis is compatible with observational constraints .",
    "ole - helium , this @xmath1 particle with screened charge , can influence the chemical evolution of ordinary matter , but if ole - helium interaction with nuclei is dominantly quasi - elastic and it might avoid over - production of anomalous isotopes ( see below ) .    the development of gravitational instabilities of ac - atomic gas follows the general path of the cdm scenario , but the composite nature of @xmath28-atoms leads to some specific difference .",
    "for @xmath85 the bulk of @xmath28 bound states appear in the universe at @xmath86 and the minimal mass of their gravitationally bound systems is given by the total mass of @xmath28 within the cosmological horizon in this period , which is of the order of @xmath87 where @xmath88 corresponds to the beginning of the ac - matter dominated stage . at @xmath89 the bulk of @xmath28-atoms is formed only at @xmath90 due to ole - helium catalysis . therefore at @xmath89 the minimal mass is independent of @xmath91 and is given by @xmath92    at small energy transfer @xmath93 cross section for interaction of ac - atoms with matter is suppressed by the factor @xmath94 , being for scattering on nuclei with charge @xmath95 and atomic weight @xmath20 of the order of @xmath96 here we take @xmath97 and @xmath98 and find that even for heavy nuclei with @xmath99 and @xmath100 this cross section does not exceed @xmath101 it proves wimp - like behavior of ac - atoms in the ordinary matter . in the galaxy",
    "they behave as collisionless gas .    still ,",
    "though cdm in the form of @xmath28 atoms is successfully formed , @xmath26 ( bound in ole - helium ) and @xmath27 ( forming anomalous helium atom @xmath102 ) should be also present in the modern universe and the abundance of primordial @xmath102 is by up to _ ten _ orders of magnitude higher , than experimental upper limit on the anomalous helium abundance in terrestrial matter .",
    "this problem can be solved by ole - helium catalyzed @xmath28 binding of @xmath102 , but different mobilities in matter of atomic interacting @xmath102 and nuclear interacting @xmath103 lead to fractionating of these species , preventing effective decrease of anomalous helium abundance .",
    "the @xmath24 charge neutrality condition naturally prevents this fractionating , making @xmath28 binding sufficiently effective to suppress terrestrial anomalous isotope abundance below the experimental upper limits .",
    "inside dense matter objects ( stars or planets ) its recombination with @xmath102 into @xmath28 atoms can provide a mechanism for the formation of dense @xmath28 objects . in this process ole - helium and anomalous helium , which were coupled to the ordinary matter by hadronic and atomic interactions ,",
    "convert into @xmath28 atoms , which immediately sinks down to the center of the body .",
    "however , though @xmath28 binding is not accompanied by strong annihilation effects , as it was the case for 4th generation hadrons",
    "@xcite , gamma radiation from it inside large volume detectors should take place . in the course of @xmath28 atom formation electromagnetic transitions with @xmath104 can be a source of @xmath105 pairs , either directly with probability @xmath106 or due to development of electromagnetic cascade .",
    "if @xmath81 recombination goes on homogeneously in earth within the water - circulating surface layer of the depth @xmath107 inside the volume of super kamiokande with size @xmath108 equilibrium @xmath81 recombination should result in a flux of @xmath105 pairs @xmath109 , which for @xmath110 can be as large as @xmath111 their signal might be easily disentangled @xcite(above a few mev range ) respect common charged current neutrino interactions and single electron tracks because the tens mev gamma lead , by pair productions , to twin electron tracks , nearly aligned along their cerenkov rings .",
    "the predicted signal strongly depends , however , on the uncertain astrophysical parameters @xcite .    in this way",
    "ac - cosmology escapes most of the troubles , revealed for other cosmological scenarios with stable heavy charged particles @xcite and provides realistic scenario for composite dark matter in the form of evanescent atoms , composed by heavy stable electrically charged particles , bearing the source of invisible light .",

    "if the charge of such particles is -1 ( as it is the case for tera - electron in @xcite ) positively charged ion @xmath83 puts coulomb barrier for any successive decrease of abundance of species , over - polluting modern universe by anomalous isotopes .",
    "it excludes the possibility of composite dark matter with @xmath196 charged constituents and only @xmath0 charged constituents avoid these troubles , being trapped by helium in neutral ole - helium or o - helium ( ano - helium ) states .    the existence of @xmath0 charged states and the absence of stable @xmath196 charged constituents can take place in ac - model and in charge asymmetric model of 4th generation . in the first case ,",
    "pregalactic abundance of @xmath27 exceeds by ten orders of magnitude the terrestrial upper limit on anomalous helium and the mechanism of suppression of this abundance is inevitably accompanied by observable effects of recombination and implies the existence of @xmath25 charge , possessed by ac leptons . in the second case , owing to excess of @xmath50 anti - quarks primordial abundance of positively charged @xmath2-baryons is exponentially suppressed and anomalous isotope over - production is avoided .",
    "excessive anti-@xmath2-quarks should retain dominantly in the form of anutium , which binds with excessive @xmath112 and then with @xmath82 in neutral ano - helium . in the both cases , ole - helium ( or ano - helium ) should exist and its possible role in nuclear transformation is the serious danger ( or exciting advantage ? ) for composite dark matter scenario .",
    "galactic cosmic rays destroy ano - helium ( as well as ole - helium ) , striking off @xmath82 .",
    "it can lead to appearance of a free [ anutium-@xmath112 ] component in cosmic rays , which can be as large as @xmath198/^4he \\sim 10^{-7}$ ] and accessible to pamela and ams experiments .",
    "the estimation is two orders less in the case of free @xmath26 from cosmic ray destruction of ole - helium @xcite .    in the context of composite dark matter like @xcite or @xcite accelerator search for new stable quarks and leptons",
    "acquires the meaning of critical test for existence of its charged components . such test will be possible in experiment atlas / lhc @xcite",
