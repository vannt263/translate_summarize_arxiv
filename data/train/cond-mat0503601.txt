    "a system of @xmath1 bose particles interacting via the yukawa potential is called yukawa bose fluid ( for short ybf ) . for three dimensional - space @xmath2",
    "the yukawa potential takes the form @xmath3=@xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an energy scale and @xmath6 is a length scale having the meaning of a screening length .",
    "whereas for the two - dimensional case however , it is described by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the modified bessel function that decays as @xmath9 at large distance while it behaves in a repulsive manner as @xmath10 at short distances . in other word",
    "the yukawa potential presents a combination of short range with soft - core type potential .",
    "early numerical calculation ( quantal monte carlo simulations ) in studying the ground state property of the three - dimensional ykf can be traced back to the work of ceperley and coworkers @xcite .",
    "there were a spurt of interest in numerical calculation of 2d ground state property of the 2d - ybf in the 90 s following the idea of nelson and seung @xcite who have shown that the statistical mechanics of the flux - line lattice ( fll ) of high-@xmath11 superconductors can be studied through an appropriate mapping onto the 2d - ybf .",
    "magro and ceperley @xcite have performed a diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) and variational monte carlo ( vmc ) numerical simulation to calibrate the ground state vortex properties and phases ( liquid or solid ) that correspond to the density and kinetic energy of the system . similar work related to the first order phase transition of abrikosov lattice to liquid of vortices have been reported by nordborg and blatter @xcite using the path integral monte carlo method . in the late 90 s",
    "other methods such as the stls model @xcite appeared in studying the ground state properties of the 2d - ybf .",
    "it has to be noted that all these works were spiralling around the system of homogeneous fluid .",
    "our work will focus on the harmonically trapped system extending the work based on the quantal monte carlo calculations of magro and ceperley @xcite . of particular interest",
    "to us is the phase diagram obtained by them for the parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) at transition points displayed in fig .",
    "( [ fig_phase ] ) . here",
    "@xmath13 indicates the de boer dimensionless parameter defined by @xmath14 while @xmath12 and @xmath15 denote the reduced density and atomic mass respectively .",
    "magro and ceperley @xcite observed that for a particular region @xmath16 the system is dominated by kinetic energy and does not crystallize .",
    "below this threshold however a peculiar behaviour of reentrant liquid has been observed . which means that system is in the liquid phase at very low density as well at high density .",
    "the crystal melts on compression and expansion .",
    "it is known that at low density the system is in liquid phase due to the fact that the screened potential can not bind to solid phase particles that are on average too far apart . for the high density",
    "the crystal is known to melt similar to the mechanism of thermal melting of a wigner crystal .",
    "however in this work we are dealing with the liquid phase of yukawa bosons only .",
    "our calculation rely on the data of the liquid phase near the transition point from the phase diagram fig .",
    "( [ fig_phase ] ) as an input to the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the use of density functional theory ( dft)-lda in this work is only a matter of computational convenience primarily due to the availability of the exact monte - carlo @xcite data of the homogeneous system .",
    "infact to our knowledge this is the first attempt to study the ybf in a trapped system .",
    "the motivation behind this work is that we believe the theory of 2d - ybf can be used in studying the ground state property of the strongly correlated liquid formed at the melted phase of many vortex system in the dilute trapped bose gas @xcite . in the latter system bose - einstein condensate ( bec )",
    "is completely depleted by quantum fluctuations , and quantum liquids appear with excitations that can carry fractional statistics .",
    "in this situation vortices can be treated as fundamental objects forming themselves as strongly correlated quantum fluid .",
    "this idea has been used in explaining certain features of hall conductance and magnetization experiments in high-@xmath11 superconductors @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the repulsive nature of vortices interacting in the short ranges is well described by the soft - core logarithmic potential . at the edge of the trap",
    "the potential is smoothed out by @xmath9 that decays to zero making it computationaly tractable and rule out any instability that may occur at the trap boundary . these characteristic making it plausible for the vortex liquid to be mapped as yukawa bosons in a similar fashion to one adapted by nelson and seung @xcite for the ybf - fll in the high @xmath11 superconductors .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in section [ dft ]",
    "we introduce the density functional theory formalism in showing that by choosing a particular type of auxiliary external trapping potential the non - interacting system of bosons can be mapped to a real interacting system .",

    "all properties are therefore a functional of the density , because the density determines the potential , which determines the hamiltonian , which determines the energy and the wave function . following this train of reasoning , the inhomogeneous dilute system of @xmath1 interacting bosons can be described within the second quantization language as    @xmath21    where @xmath22\\psi({\\bf r})$ ] and @xmath23 is the inter - atomic interaction potential .",
