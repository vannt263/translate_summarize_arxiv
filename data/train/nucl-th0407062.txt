    "<S> the lattice gas model was extended to incorporate the effect of radial flow . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to popular belief , radial flow has little effect on the clusterization process in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions except adding an ordered motion to the particles in the fragmentation source . we compared the results from the lattice gas model with and without radial flow to experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we found that charge yields from central collisions are not significantly affected by inclusion of any reasonable radial flow .    assuming local equilibrium and ignoring any collective motions , many statistical models are used to explain the cluster formation process in multifragmentations . ignoring certain collective motions , such as sideward flow , </S>",
    "<S> is often justified by the short range nature of correlations which dominates the cluster formation process . </S>",
    "<S> sideward flow only adds a uniform boost to the momentum of the particles in the neighborhood of a given particle and thus does not change the phase space distributions in the local rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> however , essential difference arises when the collective motion adds a nonuniform boost to the particles in the the neighborhood of a given particle . </S>",
    "<S> such nonuniform boost could not be cancelled by a simple change of reference frame , and could induce a nontrivial change in the phase space distribution . </S>",
    "<S> one of the simple nonuniform boosts is radial flow @xcite , and we will consider the effects of it on the cluster production process .    experimentally , we know there is a strong radial flow in central heavy - ion collision . </S>",
    "<S> the radial flow could often account for half of the kinetic energy of the particles . in the paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , essentially different pattern of charge yields are found in central collisions than in peripheral collisions . </S>",
    "<S> kunde _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. @xcite compared two systems with similar thermal energy ( at least the authors of @xcite claim so ) , but quite different radial flow energy . </S>",
    "<S> one of the systems is from low energy central collisions , where significant radial flow is present . </S>",
    "<S> another system is from higher energy peripheral collisions where little radial flow is present . </S>",
    "<S> the charge yields from the central collisions are found to be of exponential type while those from the peripheral collisions are of power law type . </S>",
    "<S> whether such a strong effect for radial flow exists or not has become a key issue for the understanding of cluster formations in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions .    for some simplified statistical models , such as copenhagen model @xcite , the berlin model @xcite and the thermodynamic canonical model @xcite , the radial flow can be added only a posteriori . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the radial flow is not included at a fundamental level . </S>",
    "<S> transport models , such as buu and qmd could incorporate the flow features naturally , but have trouble to reproduce the details of charge yields @xcite . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the lattice gas model bears some advantages in being able to incorporate flow in a natural way and also simulates some fine details of cluster productions .    in a previous paper , we have developed the lattice gas model to include radial flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was also applied to a small system with mass @xmath0 to test the effect of radial flow . </S>",
    "<S> the radial flow incorporated in the calculation is quite small , on the order of @xmath1 amev , and the effect of radial flow was found to be very small . in this paper , we will test the radial flow effects in much larger systems where the flow effect is presumably much larger , and also the experimental data are available @xcite . and </S>",
    "<S> we will show that a moderate radial flow will have little effect on the cluster formation process in the current model . to attribute the different patterns found in central collisions to radial flow motion , we need to have radial flow energies much larger than the total energy of the collision system .    for completeness of discussion , we will briefly review the microcanonical lattice gas model @xcite , and the incorporation of radial flow in the model ( see also @xcite ) . then we will try to reproduce the experimental data from central and peripheral collisions in the lattice gas model without any flow . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the calculations with quite large radial flow . </S>",
    "<S> a summary of the essential finding in this work is given in the end .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea of the lattice gas model is to discretize space and put the nucleons on the lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each lattice has at most one nucleon to simulate the short range repulsion effect between nucleons and also partially pauli principle . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive nn interaction is simulated with a bond between a pair of neighboring nucleons , where the bond strengths are take as @xmath2 mev , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these bond values could roughly reproduce the average binding energy of clusters and the energy density of infinite nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the phase space factor is difficult to calculate directly , and is usually sampled with a metropolis algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we are using the microcanonical ensemble so the total energy @xmath4 is constant . </S>",
    "<S> we start with a given configuration , hence a given @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the kinetic energy for a given @xmath4 is @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the available phase space of @xmath7 nucleons have this kinetic energy is known analytically : @xmath8 we call this value the constant energy integral @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we now attempt a switch in configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> the potential energy will change to @xmath10 . to conserve energy , the kinetic energy of the system should be @xmath11 . if @xmath12 , the switch is accepted . </S>",
    "<S> if it is less than 1 , the probability of accepting such a switch is given by the ratio . </S>",
    "<S> since all configurations have equal weights , this satisfies the principle of detailed balance . </S>",
    "<S> after many such switching attempts , an event is accepted . </S>",
    "<S> we now have to assign momenta to the nucleons so that the total kinetic energy of the @xmath13 nucleons add up to correct kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done by standard monte - carlo sampling ( for further details , see @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of radial flow is quite straight forward in lattice gas model . </S>",
    "<S> radial flow is a collective motion and does not change the thermal motion . </S>",
    "<S> so we may add the flow motion at the end of configuration sampling . </S>",
    "<S> each nucleon acquires additional momentum @xmath14 $ ] , and the constant @xmath15 is adjusted to give the required flow energy . with radial flow , </S>",
    "<S> the total energy is now @xmath16 . from this </S>",
    "<S> , it seems that flow has only made the part of the total excitation energy unavailable for thermal motion . </S>",
    "<S> but this is not totally true . </S>",
    "<S> the flow motion also affect the cluster formation in the current model .    </S>",
    "<S> after the sampling of configurations and momentum assignment , we can search for clusters . </S>",
    "<S> two neighboring nucleons are considered to belong to the same cluster when the energy for this pair is lower than zero : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the relative momentum and @xmath19 is the bond between the pair . </S>",
    "<S> this clusterization prescription is standard in lattice gas model @xcite , and was shown to be similar to the coniglio - klein prescription @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a cluster formed under this condition is , by definition , stable against particle emissions and can be compared with the charge yields from heavy - ion reactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the particle stable property of this clusterization method was also verified in a molecular dynamical simulation @xcite .    in the pair definition , </S>",
    "<S> eq.([eq : cluster ] ) , the relative motion has components from radial flow , so that in general , pairs are less bound than without radial flow . </S>",
    "<S> this effect tends to reduce the cluster size formed on the lattice . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> increasing thermal motion also has the effect of reducing the binding between neighboring nucleons and subsequently reduces the cluster size . </S>",
    "<S> so the question we have to ask is , qualitatively how big is the radial flow effect relative to the thermal effect .    , @xmath20 amev on @xmath21 lattice and one with @xmath22 , @xmath23 amev on @xmath24 lattice respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the charge yields for the @xmath25 system show a typical power law behavior and that for the @xmath26 system show a exponential behavior . </S>",
    "<S> all charge yields are normalized to the charge yield of @xmath27 element . ]    here we will present the results from microcanonical lattice gas model in two large systems , for which the experimental data were reported before @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two systems we used are : @xmath28 on @xmath21 lattice which corresponds to peripheral @xmath29 collisions at @xmath30 gev / nucleon ; @xmath22 on @xmath24 lattice which corresponds to central @xmath29 collisions at @xmath31 mev / nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> first , we will try to reproduce the experimental data in the lattice gas model with only thermal motion and no radial flow . as shown in fig.[fig:1 </S>",
    "<S> ] , the full symbols are data for the two system while the open symbols are the corresponding simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the lattice gas model can reasonably produce the general features of the data .    for lattice gas results on @xmath25 system with @xmath20 amev thermal energy , </S>",
    "<S> the charge yields show a power law behavior , and closely follow the trend of data except yields for the highest charges . </S>",
    "<S> we find the lattice gas model overestimates the charge yields when the cluster size is approaching half of the system size , @xmath32 ; this maybe due to edge effect . for the @xmath26 system , </S>",
    "<S> the lattice gas results show a nice exponential behavior for charge yields at a higher excitation energy @xmath23 amev . even though the energy scale correspondence in the lattice gas model does not correspond exactly to that in a real nuclear system , we find these thermal energies are still in reasonable agreement with expectations . for peripheral reaction </S>",
    "<S> as used in the experiment ( @xmath25 system ) , typical excitation energy is estimated to be around @xmath33 mev ( see @xcite and reference therein ) . for central collisions , </S>",
    "<S> typical excitation energy is expected to be around @xmath34 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> following the argument of @xcite , we have tried to find a reasonable fit to the data on @xmath26 system by fixing the thermal energy to @xmath35 amev while changing the radial flow energy . but </S>",
    "<S> no matter what reasonable flow energies we used the charge yields are almost not changed within statistical error in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this is a surprising result . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see , random thermal motions are order of magnitude more efficient in breaking the bonds between neighboring nucleons than radial flow motion .     on @xmath24 lattice in the microcanonical lattice gas model . </S>",
    "<S> filled symbols are for simulations with only thermal motion and no radial flow at all , at @xmath36 and @xmath37 amev respectively . </S>",
    "<S> open symbols are for simulations with thermal energy fixed at @xmath36 amev while radial flow energy is varied between @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 amev . as can be seen </S>",
    "<S> , the charge yields from simulation with @xmath41 amev roughly match the charge yields with pure thermal motion @xmath23 amev . </S>",
    "<S> all charge yields are normalized to that of @xmath27 element . ]    the effect on charge yields from radial flow and thermal motion are shown in fig.[fig:2 ] . for the charge yields from the lattice gas model , </S>",
    "<S> the difference between @xmath42 and @xmath37 amev pure thermal motion is very large . </S>",
    "<S> if we want to produce the charge yields of @xmath23 amev by introduce a large radial flow on the @xmath36 amev results , we need about @xmath40 amev radial flow . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the random thermal motion is @xmath40 times more efficient than radial flow motion at breaking the bonds between neighboring nucleons .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason flow affects clusterization so little is because bond is between nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> for a bond to break we must have large @xmath43 . with flow </S>",
    "<S> we add an extra momentum difference of @xmath44 where @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this is rather small and does not depend upon how big the dissociating system is . </S>",
    "<S> we will now show that @xmath46 is much more efficient in breaking bonds than @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by first calculating the average value of @xmath48 with pure @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider if instead of @xmath46 , the same energy was put into @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the value of @xmath48 falls by about a factor of @xmath49 .    for thermal motion @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable that @xmath51 where @xmath13 is the number of nucleons in the system . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of this equation can be established for our model by turning the discrete problem into a continuous one . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath52    we now want to estimate momentum mismatch when @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> turn this discrete problem again into a continuous problem . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the dissociating system is uniformly distributed in @xmath54 times the normal volume ( a more realistic density distribution is given in @xcite ) . calling this expanded radius @xmath55 and the reduced density @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath57 this leads to @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> comparing @xmath59 with @xmath60 , we find the former is larger by a factor @xmath61 if the dissociating system has @xmath62 nucleons </S>",
    "<S> . a more elaborate estimate using the geometry of the lattice will give a factor of @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> from our simulation , we see this factor is @xmath40 instead of @xmath49 , an increase of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the above estimate only gives a lower limit for this relative efficiency , any deviation from a uniform distribution of nucleons in the simulation will definitely increase this ratio . </S>",
    "<S> further , the additional thermal energy for the pair of neighboring nucleons is actually weighted with a distribution for the pair of neighboring particles , so that resulting average will be higher than our estimation . </S>",
    "<S> the overall increase of @xmath63 in the ratio of relative bond - breaking efficiency is most likely the result of a combination of these factors .    </S>",
    "<S> since the flow values we used here are a lot higher than the total energy deposition in central collisions at @xmath31 mev / nucleon , the lattice gas simulations suggests that there is little effect of radial flow on the clusterization process at intermediate energies . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect that caused the charge yields to behave like exponential type rather than power law type is the increase of thermal energy in central collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> the inefficiency of radial flow on breaking clusters is also observed by gulminelli and chomaz @xcite in a canonical lattice gas model . for other commonly used thermal models , which have the same assumption of sudden dissociation </S>",
    "<S> , a simple inclusion of radial flow as we did here will not likely produce a significant difference . </S>",
    "<S> different assumptions about the cluster formation may change the relative efficiency of the radial flow and thermal motion in breaking up clusters , but the large difference between radial flow and thermal motion will hold in any reasonable models .    </S>",
    "<S> the above discussion did not address the issue of the dynamical evolution of the heavy - ion reaction system , especially during the violent stage of the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the clusterization method used in lattice gas model is similar to the @xmath64 phase space coalescence . </S>",
    "<S> if we blindly apply the estimate to normal density , we would find that thermal motion is @xmath65 times more efficient in breaking bonds than radial flow motion . </S>",
    "<S> thus we may expect our idea to shed some light on the violent stage of the reaction as well . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical models has also made significant progress to in reproducing cluster formations . in qmd model , </S>",
    "<S> algorithms like ecra and saca have been formulated to identify asymptotic clusters at an early stage @xcite . in buu model , </S>",
    "<S> stochastic langevin method was introduced to address the stochastic nature of cluster formations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these methods are calculational intensive . </S>",
    "<S> we hope future dynamical simulations will confirm our expectations .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have tested the effect of radial flow on cluster formation in microcanonical lattice gas model . </S>",
    "<S> we used quite large system where the radial flow effect is expected to be strong and data already existed . </S>",
    "<S> we found that reasonable amount of radial flow could not significantly change charge yields in the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> for the two systems as discussed in @xcite , we found the charge yields changed from power law behavior to an exponential behavior purely because of increased thermal energy . </S>",
    "<S> thermal energy is order of magnitude more efficient in reducing the size of large clusters than radial flow . </S>",
    "<S> these conclusions should be valid for most thermal models where dynamical evolution of the source is ignored . </S>"
