    "almost 100@xmath0 of the heavy nuclei are produced by neutron capture processes , because of the high coulomb barrier reduces the impact of charge particale reactions . in nature , 32 nuclei can be found on the left side of the stable valley from @xmath1se to @xmath2hg , which are shielded against neutron capture . for the synthesis of these nuclei",
    "the p - process has to be estabished .",
    "the most favored scenario for the p - process are type ii supernova ( sn ) explosions . in these environments high temperatures 1.7@xmath3t@xmath4@xmath33.3",
    "can be reached for a short time when the shock front passes though the o / ne layers @xcite .",
    "a large reaction network involving thousands of reaction rates is necessary to describe the synthesis process for the p - nuclei . in most of the cases",
    "the astrophysical rates were calculated by means of the hauser feshbach model . in experimental efforts",
    "only a few of the required astrophysical rates have been investigated @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have shown that the present statistical models have overestimated the values for @xmath5-induced astrophysical rates . the aim of this work is to look for rates ( a@xmath657 ) that have a significant influence of the p - abundences for further experimental efforts .",
    "for the following investigations a nuclear reaction network used for x - ray bursts at michigan state university was extended .",
    "the network now contains about 1800 nuclei covering all elements from hydrogen to bismuth .",
    "simulated was the abundance evolution during a sn explosion ( 10@xmath7erg ) in 14 different o / ne - layers for a 25 solar mass star during the first second of the explosion .",
    "the temperature and density profiles were available as function of time in tabulated form @xcite .",
    "the seed abundances were taken from a pre - sn model @xcite . in the calculations",
    "the n- , p- , @xmath5- and their inverse rates from the non - smoker code @xcite were used ( z@xmath68 ) for all other reactions the data @xcite were included .",
    "the reaction rates were changed in the frame of a parameter study . + * collective change of rates : * all n - induced and their inverse rates ( a@xmath657 ) were multiplied by a factor of three and divided , respectively . in each case",
    "the p - abundances were calculated and the overproduction factors were compared to the result based on the presently accepted hf - rates . the p- and @xmath5-induced rates were treated in the same way . +",
    "* change of p - nuclei rates : * all n - induced and their inverse reactions including p - nuclei were changed going to the neutron rich side and to the neutron deficient side of the stable valley , respectively .",
    "the same procedure was done for all p - induced and their inverse rates , going to the proton rich and proton deficient side respectively and for @xmath5-rates as well .",
    "the simulations were performed analog to the collective change of rates .",
    "+ * branchings : * in the integrated reaction flux all branchings were detected ( a@xmath657 ) when the second strongest flux was greater than 20@xmath0 of the main flux .",
    "the branching ratios were changed and the influence on the p - abundances was determined .",
    "figure 1 is showing the ratio of the p - abundances calculated with changed rates divided by the abundances simulated with the unchanged rates .",
    "a collective change of n - induced reactions has an influence on the whole mass range , espacially in the lower a@xmath380 and upper a@xmath6150 mass ranges .",
    "the influence of the p - induced reactions is only at lower mass range a@xmath6110 .",
    "in contrast to the p - induced reactions , @xmath5-induced reactions showed a big influence on the p - abundances at high mass a@xmath6140 , with a exception the @xmath8mo(@xmath5,@xmath9)-reaction .      for n - induced reactions the change in individual rates were much less sensitive compared to the collective change of the rates .",
    "the change of ( n,@xmath9)-rates on the p - nuclei showed almost no influence while the change of the ( @xmath9,n)-reactions showed a sensitivity . the ( @xmath9,p)-rates determine significantly the p - abundances of @xmath1se , @xmath10kr , @xmath11sr , @xmath8mo , and @xmath12ru ( a@xmath3100 ) .",
    "proton capture rates have almost no influence on the p - abundances .",
    "the comparision of the abundances calculated with the collective and the individually change of p - induced rates suggest that for proton involved reactions the abundances of @xmath10kr , @xmath8mo , and @xmath12ru are only sensitive to the photodisintegration of these nuclei .",
    "more than 200 branches were detected in the integrated reaction flux .",
    "most of the branchings showed no influence on the p - abundances .",
    "but for a@xmath6140 a set of ( @xmath9,@xmath5)- and ( @xmath9,n)-branches were sensitive for p - abundances .",
    "these branching rations were detected in a small temperature window 2.4@xmath3t@xmath4@xmath32.8 . in this temperature window",
    ", the reaction flow is so dynamic that a change of these branchings showed an influence on several p - nulei .",
    "the changes in the p - abundances were in most of the cases less than 30@xmath0 in the particular layer investigated , when increasing the second strongest branching reaction by a factor of 3 .",
    "but the result of using a wrong potential to calculate the astrophysical reaction rates can be seen in fig .",
    "1 . further experiments should measure @xmath5-induced reactions in the mass range a@xmath6150 , because there they have a significant influence on the p - abundances and there are no experimental data at all .",
