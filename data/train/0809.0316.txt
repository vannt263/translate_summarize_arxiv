    "the manner in which gas is removed from discs around young stars has critical consequences for theories of planet formation , as the formation of gas - giant planets must precede the dissipation of gas discs .",
    "currently , models of protoplanetary disc evolution suggest that the most of the gas is removed by a combination of viscous accretion through the disc and photoevaporation by irradiation from the central star [ e.g. ,  @xcite ; see also the recent reviews by @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "such models agree reasonably well with current data , but the ionizing luminosities of t tauri stars ( required to drive the photoevaporation ) are very poorly constrained .",
    "@xcite used archival data to estimate the chromospheric ionizing fluxes from a small sample of bright t tauri stars , and found values in the range @xmath5@xmath6 ionizing photons per second .",
    "however , recent data suggests that this may over - estimate more typical values of @xmath7 by 12 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "photoevaporative flows have been observed clearly in ultracompact hii regions around massive stars @xcite , and in the externally illuminated `` proplyds '' in the orion nebula ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the evidence for or against the existence of central star - driven photoevaporative winds from discs around solar - mass stars is rather tenuous .",
    "@xcite modelled the profiles of optical forbidden emission lines and found reasonable agreement with both the line fluxes and profiles obtained in the spectroscopic survey of @xcite . however , some discrepancies were also present ( notably between the predicted and observed fluxes from [ oi ] ) , and no further studies of such emission lines exist .    for several reasons , the [ neii ] fine - structure line at 12.81@xmath0",
    "m offers perhaps the best opportunity to confirm or deny the existence of a slow ( @xmath8kms@xmath3 ) ionized wind from a t tauri disc .",
    "the high ionization potential of neon ( 21.56ev ) means that ne@xmath9 only exists close to t tauri stars in photoionized gas , so forbidden emission lines from neon ions are unlikely to arise elsewhere in the t tauri system .",
    "the 12.81@xmath0 m line also falls in an atmospheric window ( unlike the [ neiii ] line at 15.55@xmath0 m ) , and can therefore be observed from the ground at echelle resolution .",
    "moreover , the continuum emission from the star - disc system is orders of magnitude weaker in the mid - infrared than in the optical , so the line - to - continuum ratio for [ neii ] can often be higher than for optical forbidden lines such as [ nii ] or [ sii ] .",
    "in addition , as will be shown , the critical density of the [ neii ] line is such that most of the emission arises in the `` launching region '' of the photoevaporative wind , making it an excellent tracer of disc photoevaporation .",
    "recently the _ spitzer space telescope _ has detected the [ neii ] 12.81@xmath0 m line towards more than 20 young , solar - mass stars @xcite , and in most cases it is thought to arise in the star - disc system .",
    "@xcite observed the [ neii ] line from the nearby source tw hya at high resolution ( @xmath10 ) , and found that the line ( with width @xmath11kms@xmath3 ) was narrower than lines that originate in the accretion funnel , but significantly broader than lines emitted from the disc at larger radii : this strongly suggests that the line originates in a hot disc atmosphere . @xcite and @xcite showed that x - ray heating of the disc can reproduce the observed line fluxes , but a photoevaporative disc wind should give rise to a similar line flux @xcite . while both ionization mechanisms ( x - ray and uv ) can likely explain the observed line fluxes , the velocity structure of a photoevaporative wind should result in a line profile that is distinct from that produced by x - ray irradiation of a bound disc atmosphere . in this _",
    "i model the profiles of the [ neii ] 12.81@xmath0 m line emitted by photoevaporative winds , and find that high - resolution spectroscopy can provide an unambiguous means of detecting such winds in t tauri systems .",
    "in order to construct velocity profiles it is first necessary to compute the hydrodynamic structure of the wind . here",
    "two different cases are considered : the standard photoevaporative wind @xcite and the `` direct '' wind , applicable to a disc with an inner hole that is optically thin to ionizing photons @xcite .",
    "i use the zeus2d hydrodynamics code @xcite to model the winds , following the approaches of @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "i assume azimuthal and midplane symmetry , and therefore model the disc using a polar [ @xmath12 grid covering the range @xmath13 $ ] denotes spherical radius ; upper - case @xmath14 cylindrical radius . ] .",
    "the grid cells are logarithmically - spaced in @xmath15 and linearly - spaced in @xmath16 , with the numbers of radial ( @xmath17 ) and polar ( @xmath18 ) cells chosen so that the grid cells are approximately square throughout ( i.e.  @xmath19 , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the rotation option in zeus2d , which introduces a centrifugal pseudo - force , is turned on , and accelerations due to gravity are evaluated using only a point mass at the origin .",
    "i adopt the van leer ( second - order ) interpolation scheme , and the standard von neumann & richtmyer form for the artificial viscosity ( with @xmath20 ) .      in the standard case",
    "the wind models follow the `` photoevaporative disc wind '' models of @xcite .",
    "these models make use of the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* specifically the  weak - wind  case ) , who used detailed radiative transfer calculations to determine the structure of the ionized disc atmosphere .",
    "the atmosphere is isothermal at @xmath21k , with a sound speed @xmath22kms@xmath3 .",
    "the critical length - scale @xmath23 , known as the gravitational radius , is found by equating the sound speed of the ionized gas with the local ( keplerian ) orbital speed , so @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass of the central star .",
    "the ( number ) density at the base of the ionized atmosphere , @xmath26 , determines the structure of the wind , and the value at @xmath23 is @xmath27 @xmath28@xmath29s@xmath3 is the case b recombination coefficient for atomic hydrogen at @xmath21k @xcite , and the constant @xmath30 was determined by the numerical calculations of @xcite . inside @xmath23",
    "the base density scales as @xmath31 , while outside @xmath23 it scales as @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite adopt the following fitting form for the base density , which varies smoothly between the two power - laws : @xmath33 the disc atmosphere is given an isothermal equation of state , and the outer and inner radial boundaries are set as outflow boundaries .",
    "the inner polar boundary ( the @xmath34-axis ) is a reflecting boundary , but the flow is not at all sensitive to the inner boundary conditions .",
    "the base of the flow ( i.e.  the disc midplane ) is held constant at every time - step , using the density profile @xmath26 from equation [ eq : base_den ] .",
    "[ the base of the flow is actually found several disc scale - heights above the midplane @xcite , but additional calculations show that this approximation has a negligible effect on the line profiles . ]",
    "the flow is thus assumed to be recombination - dominated ( with negligible advection across the ionization front ) : previous studies suggest that this approximation is valid ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the base cells are given a keplerian velocity in the orbital direction , and zero velocity in the radial direction .",
    "the polar ( vertical ) velocity out of the base cells is not prescribed , but instead computed hydrodynamically : typically the launch velocity is @xmath350.4@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the models are computed in dimensionless units : the unit of length is @xmath23 , the unit of time is the orbital period at @xmath23 , and the density is normalized so that @xmath37 . initially the grid is filled with a uniform density of @xmath38 , and the model is evolved forward in time until a steady - state is reached . in order to compute line profiles , the resulting density and velocity structures are scaled to physical units by choosing the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath25 .",
    "i use a grid with @xmath39r@xmath40 , @xmath41r@xmath40 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . as one would expect there is excellent agreement with the results of @xcite , with the location of the sonic surface and the integrated mass - loss rate agreeing with their result to better than 1% accuracy .",
    "choosing different locations for the boundaries ( @xmath44r@xmath40 ; @xmath45r@xmath40 ) has a negligible effect on the structure of the flow and affects the computed line fluxes and profiles only at the percent level .",
    "a numerical convergence test ( using twice the grid resolution in both dimensions ) suggests that the flow solution is correct to 12% accuracy .",

    "for the case of a disc with an optically thin inner cavity , the model of @xcite is used . in this case",
    "the calculation is not scale - free ( because of the ionization / recombination balance calculation ) , so physical units are used .",
    "in addition , because the pressure scale - height of the cold disc must be resolved into several grid cells , somewhat higher resolution is required than in the standard case ( where the underlying cold disc is treated as a boundary condition ) .",
    "i adopt model parameters of @xmath48m@xmath2 and @xmath49s@xmath3 , and grid parameters @xmath50au , @xmath51au , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "the line profiles for the standard case are shown in fig.[fig : line_disc ] : for clarity , only the edge - on and face - on cases are shown . when viewed edge - on the line is broad ( 3040kms@xmath3 ) and double - peaked , while face - on inclination results in a line that is narrower ( 10kms@xmath3 ) and slightly blue - shifted ( 67kms@xmath3 ) . at resolution",
    "@xmath104 the blue - shift is comparable for all inclinations @xmath105 ( see table [ tab : results ] ) , as any double - peaked structure in the line is not well - resolved . these line profiles can be easily understood by considering the flow structure . at large radii",
    "the wind is essentially isothermal and spherically symmetric , and is analogous to a parker wind solution .",
    "the streamlines are close to radial , and the density along streamlines drops as @xmath106 .",
    "as the density is sub - critical the line flux per unit volume scales @xmath107 , so the total line luminosity ( integrated over volume ) is dominated by the emission from small radii .",
    "inspection of the mass - loss profile ( see , e.g. , fig.7 of @xcite ) shows that @xmath108% of the mass - loss comes from @xmath109 , and the density structure is such that the critical density is reached only at radii @xmath110 ( see fig.[fig : pdw_struc ] ) .",
    "this highlights why the [ neii ] 12.81@xmath0 m line is an ideal probe of disc photoevaporation : lines with higher critical densities will likely be dominated by emission from high density regions very close to the star , while lines with lower critical densities are insensitive to the launching region of the wind . in the launching region the rotation speed of the disc is greater than the wind or thermal speeds ( as @xmath111 at @xmath112 ) , so when viewed edge - on the line profile is dominated by keplerian rotation and shows a pronounced double - peaked structure . when viewed face - on the rotation is entirely in the plane of the sky , and instead the vertical component of the wind velocity results in a blue - shifted profile . in this case",
    "the profile is slightly asymmetric , with a blue `` tail '' due to high - velocity , low - density gas at large @xmath15 . in all cases",
    "the line - widths are significantly larger than expected from thermal broadening alone .",
    "this occurs because the streamlines are almost radial at large radius .",
    "consequently the dispersion in the line - of - sight component of the flow velocity is always larger than the thermal line - width , resulting in broader than thermal line - widths even for face - on discs .    in the case of a disc with a cleared central hole , the line profile when viewed edge - on is markedly different from the standard case ( see fig.[fig : line_10au ] ) .",
    "the removal of gas with high rotation speeds results in a profile that is much less strongly double - peaked , and significantly narrower ( 1520kms@xmath3 ) . still larger hole sizes result in even less pronounced double - peaked profiles , and for hole sizes @xmath113r@xmath40",
    "there is no evidence of a double - peaked profile .",
    "the profile in the face - on case is similar to that seen in the standard model : fairly narrow ( @xmath4kms@xmath3 ) , slightly asymmetric , and blue - shifted ( 79kms@xmath3 ) , and this general shape is seen irrespective of the size of the central hole .",
    "the integrated line flux is somewhat larger than in the standard case ( by a factor of @xmath114 ) , due to the higher density in the wind launching region .",
    "the predicted line luminosities are a few @xmath115l@xmath2 .",
    "the exact line fluxes are likely only accurate to within a factor of @xmath93 , as discussed in section [ sec : profiles ] above , but the predicted line strengths are comparable to those predicted by previous calculations , both from uv ionization @xcite and x - ray ionization @xcite .",
    "the emitted line fluxes scale approximately linearly with @xmath7 , and the shape of the line profile is largely independent of the value of @xmath7 .",
    "this can be understood from equations [ eq : base_den ] & [ eq : p_u ] : the line flux scales @xmath116 as long as @xmath117 , and the density of the ionized gas scales @xmath118 .",
    "we see from fig.[fig : pdw_struc ] that almost all of the gas in the emitting region is below the critical density for [ neii ] , and additional calculations suggest that this holds as long as @xmath119s@xmath3 .",
    "higher still ionizing fluxes will result in the critical density being exceeded , making the [ neii ] line less sensitive to the launching region of the wind , but this is unlikely to be relevant to discs around t tauri stars .",
    "in general , these results compare favourably with the previous modelling of @xcite .",
    "these authors modelled the emission from optical forbidden lines ( [ sii ] and [ nii ] ) , and for face - on inclinations found that the line profiles were blue - shifted by @xmath4kms@xmath3 .",
    "the blue - shift decreased with increasing inclination angle , and in the edge - on discs the lines were centred on zero velocity .",
    "they did not , however , find any double - peaked lines , even in the edge - on case .",
    "the reasons for this are not entirely clear , but it is likely attributable to the different critical densities of the lines considered .",
    "the critical densities of the [ sii ] and [ nii ] lines are lower that that of the [ neii ] 12.81@xmath0 m line , so these lines are dominated by emission from larger radii , where the rotation speed of the disc is smaller .",
    "consequently , as in the case of a disc with a large inner hole , the lines do not appear double - peaked .",
    "so far i have neglected the effects of x - ray ionization in producing [ neii ] emission , but when discussing observations this can not be ignored .",
    "@xcite modelled the effects of x - ray irradiation in detail ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "unlike in the uv case , the x - ray luminosities of t tauri stars are well - known , and the predicted [ neii ] emission from x - ray ionized gas is comparable in strength to the emission from the photoevaporative wind ( @xmath120l@xmath2 ) .",
    "x - ray heating likely creates a hot , but static , disc atmosphere , and in real systems the emission from this atmosphere will be added to the line profiles modelled here .",
    "the line profiles from such a bound atmosphere have not been modelled in detail , but their general shape was discussed by @xcite .",
    "they find that emission is dominated by gas at small radii @xmath121au ) , with most of the emission arising at radii where the rotational speed of the disc gas is @xmath8kms@xmath3 .",
    "the gas temperature in this region is 10005000k , resulting in an intrinsic ( doppler ) line - width of @xmath122kms@xmath3 .",
    "the line should therefore be double - peaked when viewed edge - on , with a profile similar to that predicted here . in the face - on case",
    ", however , the profile should be different : narrow ( @xmath122kms@xmath3 ) , and centred on zero velocity .",
    "the broader ( @xmath123kms@xmath3 ) line - width predicted here is unlikely to be matched by a static disc atmosphere unless any turbulence in the disc is highly supersonic ( which is generally not the case in protoplanetary discs , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or unless the emission originates very close to the star ( @xmath124au ) . in addition , a static atmosphere results in line emission centred on zero velocity , distinct from the blue - shifted profile of the photoevaporative wind .",
    "critical to observing this blue - shift are the relative line fluxes from the static atmosphere and the wind .",
    "if these are comparable , as predicted for @xmath125erg s@xmath3 and @xmath126s@xmath3 , then the diagnostic blue - shift will likely be 25kms@xmath3 .",
    "recently @xcite observed the [ neii ] 12.81@xmath0 m line from the nearby face - on ( @xmath127 ) disc tw hya , at a resolution of @xmath10 .",
    "the emission was unresolved at an effective spatial resolution of @xmath128au , suggesting that it arises within this distance of the central star .",
    "@xcite measured a line - width ( fwhm ) of @xmath11kms@xmath3 , centred on @xmath129kms@xmath3 .",
    "the blue - shift is not statistically significant , in part because of the limitations of the wavelength calibration , but the line width is rather larger than expected from a static disc atmosphere alone .",
    "in addition there was some evidence for asymmetry in the profile , with an enhanced flux on the blue side of the line , but not at a statistically significant level .",
    "the observed profile is consistent with emission from a photoevaporative wind ( centred on @xmath13010kms@xmath3 ) combined with the emission from a heated disc atmosphere ( centred on zero velocity ) .",
    "further such observations are expected in the near future , and in this _",
    "i have shown that high - resolution observations of the [ neii ] 12.81@xmath0 m line can provide a critical test of models of disc photoevaporation .",
    "detection of blue - shifted [ neii ] emission would provide unambiguous evidence of a photoevaporative wind , and observations of these line profiles may represent the most readily observable diagnostic of central star - driven disc photoevaporation .",

    "<S> i model profiles of the [ neii ] forbidden emission line at 12.81@xmath0 m , emitted by photoevaporative winds from discs around young , solar - mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted line luminosities ( @xmath1l@xmath2 ) are consistent with recent data , and the line profiles vary significantly with disc inclination . </S>",
    "<S> edge - on discs show broad ( 3040kms@xmath3 ) double - peaked profiles , due to the rotation of the disc , while in face - on discs the structure of the wind results in a narrower line ( @xmath4kms@xmath3 ) and a significant blue - shift ( 510kms@xmath3 ) . </S>",
