    "the resulting line profiles ( figure  [ fig : lineprofile ] left panel ) indicate that we have resolved v773  tau  a as a double - lined spectroscopic binary in the near - infrared , despite the relative large rotational broadening ( b2007 ) .",

    "our sed modeling also finds a marginally significant @xmath31 excess , further reinforcing the hypothesis that there is circum - b material reprocessing radiation from b. however , the interpretation of this b sed modeling is complicated by the fact that b is seen to be variable ( figure  [ fig : relphotometry ] ) , and the input data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* d2003 ) are not contemporaneous .",
    "the combination of our b - component dynamical mass ( 2.35 m@xmath0 ) and luminosity estimate ( 2.6 l@xmath0 ) suggests a multiple system interpretation .",
    "for instance , @xcite models predict a luminosity of 17 l@xmath0 and t@xmath35 @xmath1 6200 k for a 3 myr ( b2007 ) single star at 2.35 m@xmath0 .",
    "( note that a 1-@xmath27 excursion downward in the mass estimate  1.7 msun  would predict 2.8 l@xmath0 and 5200 k from these same models . )",
    "such a b - luminosity and temperature would seem to be impossible based on determinations presented here . however assuming the simplest multiple configuration for b as a binary arrangement with a pair of 1.175 m@xmath0 stars , the @xcite models predict a pair of such stars to have a total luminosity of 2.6 l@xmath0 , and t@xmath35 @xmath1 4800 k , in better agreement with the findings here .",
    "while mass arguments alone would not exclude a single star interpretation , combined with double - lined indications in the near - ir spectroscopic analysis (   [ sec : specanalysis ] ) , the circumstantial case that v773  tau  b is a multiple stellar system seems strong .",
    "however , experience ( e.g. t2002 , d2003 ) has shown that one must consider the present a - b orbit model as preliminary pending additional phase coverage , and the b - mass estimate is still significantly uncertain ( @xmath1 29% 1-@xmath27 ) .",
    "photometric variability in v773 tau has typically been attributed to the b component ( d2003 ; figure  [ fig : relphotometry ] ) , and interpreted as changing line - of - sight extinction from circum - b material .",
    "this interpretation is at least complicated both by potential b multiplicity , and by the physical size of the a - b orbit ( 15.3 au , table  [ tab : abphysics ] ) .",
    "dynamical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that stable regions for diffuse material are offset from binaries by several times the orbital semi - major axis .",
    "presumably the outer radius of any stable circum - b orbit should be on the order of 15 / 3 @xmath1 5 au .",
    "similarly , the typical size of a putative b subsystem should be several times smaller than this 5 au scale ",
    "probably @xmath39 1 au  making the working model for b a short - period binary . in this picture , circumbinary material in the approximately 25au range would be responsible for both the near - infrared excess and photometric variability of b. the large amount of dust needed to explain both extinction and variability ( see below ) raises the question whether it could remain dynamically stable in the region between b as a putative short - period binary and the larger a - b orbit , and whether such a reservoir of material would show other observable signatures such as detectable thermal ir and millimeter flux . as a system v773  tau shows a large mid - ir flux above photspheric levels ( e.g. * ? ? ? * d2003 , spitzer taurus legacy program , padgett et al .",
    "2011 in prep ) , and @xcite lists significant flux at 850 @xmath6 m and 1.3 mm .",
    "however the presence of the v773  tau  c component ( d2003 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) significantly complicates the interpretation of these flux measurements .",
    "a spatially - resolved mm study with a sensitive facility such as alma would clarify the distribution of circumstellar material in the v773  tau system .",
    "if the putative b variability is due to changing line - of - sight extinction , this degree of variability is extraordinary . to account for the amplitude of the @xmath5-variability shown in figure  3 , a variation in @xmath38 of up to 25mag ( assuming ism - like dust opacity ) would be indicated .",
    "such large @xmath38 excursions seem discrepant with the results of the sed modeling above .",
    "a more plausible alternative might be an optically - thick structure  perhaps a disk that may or may not be perturbed by complicated dynamics  obscuring the line - of - sight to b components , allowing only a small amount of scattered light to reach the observer .",
    "variability on short timescale could be related to one of the components of b temporarily coming into direct view along its orbit , akin to the kh  15d system ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the current sampling of the light curve for b is too sparse to decisvely test this hypothesis . in either case , this large attenuation could explain why no clear detection of b is seen in extensive optical spectroscopic monitoring ( * ? ? ?",
    "* b2007 , table  [ tab : rvdata ] ) .",
    "if the inference of b multiplicity and circum - b material is correct , then the v773  tau system seems remarkably similar to the system , where circumbinary material is found around one but not both binaries in the system @xcite . in hd  98800",
    "the inner b and outer a - b orbit significantly complicates the dynamics of b circumbinary material , leading to an inference of disk truncation and warping @xcite .",
    "the apparent increasing system complexity raises questions of stability in v773  tau .",
    "while more information on the b and c components will be necessary to address the specific stability of v773  tau , it is clear that such complex systems are a common outcome of the star formation process , and can remain stable for gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
