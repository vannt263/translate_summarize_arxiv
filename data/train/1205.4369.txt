    "the derivative nonlinear schdinger equation ( dnls ) @xcite @xmath0 has many physical applications , especially in space plasma physics and nonlinear optics .",
    "it well describes small - amplitude nonlinear alfvn waves in a low-@xmath1 plasma , propagating strictly parallel or at a small angle to the ambient magnetic field .",
    "it was shown that the dnls also models large - amplitude magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves in a high-@xmath1 plasma propagating at an arbitrary angle to the ambient magnetic field .",
    "in nonlinear optics , the modified nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite , which is gauge equivalent to dnls , arises in the theory of ultrashort femtosecond nonlinear pulses in optical fibres , when the spectral width of the pulses becomes comparable with the carrier frequency and the effect of self - steepening of the pulse should be taken into account .",
    "high order solitons describe the interaction between n solitons of equal amplitude but having a particular chirp @xcite . in the terminology of inverse scattering transformation ( ist )",
    ", they correspond to multiple - pole solitons . in the case of the korteweg - de vries equation ( kdv )",
    ", the poles must be simple , that is the reason why high order nonsingular solitons do not exist .",
    "indeed we could obtain multiple - pole solutions by darboux transformation ( dt ) , such as positon solutions @xcite .",
    "the high order solitons for nonlinear schrdinger equation had been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the high order solitons of dnls have never been reported .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that such solutions may be obtained by generalized darboux transformations ( gdt ) .",
    "recently , the rogue wave phenomenon @xcite , which  appears from nowhere and disappears without a trace \" , has been a subject of extensive study .",
    "those waves , also known as freak , monster or giant waves , is characterized with large amplitudes and often appear on the sea surface .",
    "one of the possible ways to explain the rogue waves is the rogue wave solution and modulation instability and there are a series of works done by akhmediev s group @xcite .",
    "different approaches have been proposed to construct the generalized rogue wave solutions of nonlinear schdinger equation ( nls ) , for example , the algebro - geometric method is adopted by matveev et al @xcite , ohta and yang work in the framework of hirota bilinear method while the present authors use the gdt as a tool @xcite . in the ist terminology",
    ", the high rogue wave corresponds to multiple - pole solution at the branch spectral parameter in the non - vanishing background @xcite . the first order rogue wave for dnls was obtained by xu and coworkers recently @xcite .",
    "however , the high order rogue wave had never been studied .",
    "we will tackle this problem by constructing generalized darboux transformations .    the darboux transformation @xcite , which does not need to do the inverse spectral analysis , provides a direct way to solve the lax pair equations algebraically .",
    "however , there is a defect that classical dt can not be iterated at the same spectral parameter .",
    "this defect makes it impossible to construct the high order rogue wave solutions by dt directly .",
    "thus we must modify the dt method . in this work ,",
    "we extend the dt by the limit technique , so that it can be iterated at the same spectral parameter .",
    "the modified transformation is referred as generalized darboux transformation ( gdt ) .",
    "the inverse scattering method was used to study dnls with vanishing background ( vbc ) and non - vanishing background ( nvbc ) @xcite . the @xmath2-bright soliton formula for dnls",
    "was established by nakamura and chen by the hirota bilinear method @xcite and the dt for dnls was constructed by imai @xcite and steudel @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one key aim of this work is the construction of the gdt and based on it , the high order soliton solutions and rogue wave are obtained .",
    "in addition to above two kinds of solutions , new @xmath2-solitons and high order rational solutions are also found .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we provide a rigorous proof for elementary dt for kaup - newell ( kn ) system .",
    "furthermore , based on the elementary dt , we construct for kn system the binary dt , which is referred as the dt - ii while the elementary dt is referred as dt - i .",
    "we also iterate these dt and work out the @xmath2-fold dt s both for dt - i and dt - ii , and consider two different kinds of reductions of the dt of the kn system to the dnls . in section 3 , the generalized dt - i and dt - ii are constructed in detail by the limit technique . in section 4 , we consider the applications of the generalized dt ( gdt ) and calculate various high order solutions , which include high order bright solitons with the vbc , and high order rogue wave solutions .",
    "final section concludes the paper and offers some discussions .",
