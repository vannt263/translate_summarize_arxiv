    "high contrast imaging of the immediate environment ( within a few astronomical units ) of nearby stars is critical to the understanding of formation and evolution of planetary systems .",
    "the ultimate goal of planetary systems studies is to find and characterize planets similar to ours , in the hope that we can find other `` habitable '' words susceptible of harboring life .",
    "several approaches are currently under development to achieve the high level of contrast required :    * nulling interferometry in the mid - ir with a  30 m baseline space interferometer . * visible coronagraphy with a 4 m to 8 m space telescope . * large ground based telescopes ( 8 m to 100 m ) and high performance ao systems optimized for bright targets .    while the first 2 options are targeting earth - size planets around nearby stars , the ground based systems have more modest initial goals : planets more massive than jupiter or young jupiter mass planets . the plans to build larger ( 30 m to 100 m ) telescopes and the fast progress in high - performance ao systems and coronagraphy however opens up the possibility of pursuing more ambitious goals .",
    "direct imaging of earth - size planets is even considered for 100 m diameter telescopes @xcite .    the contrast detection limit within a psf",
    "is set by photon noise and speckle noise in the image .",
    "if only photon noise is considered the theoretical detection limit for a large telescope ( 30 m to 100 m ) allows relatively easy detection of earth - size planets around nearby stars @xcite .",
    "this however seems to be a very optimistic assumption , as current ao systems are all limited by speckle noise @xcite within the central arcsecond .",
    "the detection limit is therefore likely to be driven by how well the speckles can be calibrated / removed .",
    "fast atmospheric speckles average fairly rapidly , but slower - evolving speckles are more problematic .",
    "experience acquired on ground - based telescope has shown that there is no such thing as a truly static speckles , as extremely small drifts in the wavefront are sufficient to appreciably change the speckle s intensity : for a speckle of intensity @xmath0 the central star s intensity to be stable to within 1% , the corresponding spatial frequency would need to be stable to @xmath1 wave ( 4 picometers at 1.6 @xmath2 m ) .    in non - coronagraphic imaging with current ao systems on large telescopes ,",
    "the psf wings are relatively smooth in long exposures : about 10% of the speckle background does not average at about 1(figure 1 in @xcite ) . through careful psf calibration ,",
    "some of the residual speckle structure can be subtracted @xcite , yielding a point source detection limit more than 10 times fainter than the psf background level within the central arcsecond .",
    "this factor tends to become larger with increasing distance from the psf core , partially thanks to the chromatic elongation of speckles which makes the psf smoother .",
    "differential imaging techniques based on spectral properties of the source could further increase this factor by up to @xmath3 for simultaneous imaging in 2 bands and @xmath4 for simultaneous imaging in 3 bands @xcite .",
    "techniques using the coherence properties of speckles have also been proposed @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "performance of an adaptive optics system is quantified by the ratio between the light intensity at the point of the psf considered and the light intensity at the psf s center .",
    "this quantity is referred to as the psf contrast in the rest of the paper .",
    "the goal of this work is to give limits on this psf contrast achievable with ao systems , and to propose solutions to reach these limits : which wfs to choose ? how to drive the deformable mirror ( dm ) ? is a coronagraph necessary ?",
    "if yes , which one ? detection limits for faint companions",
    "are significantly harder to predict than psf contrast for the reasons detailed above , and will not be computed in this paper .",
    "the psf contrast in a photon - noise limited ao system is a function of the ability of the wfs to accurately measure the corresponding spatial frequency in the pupil plane phase .",

    "[ sec : contrastanalytical ] .",
    "aliasing effects are discussed in  [ sec : alias ] , and solutions to reduce their impact on the psf contrast are proposed . in  [ sec : wfss ] , the sensitivity of common wfss to photon noise is discussed , and a wfs based upon zernike s phase contrast is shown to offer optimal sensitivity .",
    "results of  [ sec : contrastanalytical ] ,  [ sec : alias ] and  [ sec : wfss ] are combined and discussed in  [",
    "sec : perf_disc ] to derive realistic limits to the psf contrast in ground - based ao systems and identify optimal approaches to detect extrasolar planets .",

    "notations used in this work are given in table [ tab : notations ] . in this paper ,",
    "i consider a `` perfect '' coronagraph : if the entrance pupil of the system had no phase aberrations , the focal plane light intensity would be equal to 0 outside the inner working angle ( smallest angular separation at which the coronagraph can be used to detect a faint companion , denoted iwa in the rest of the paper ) of the coronagraph within the spectral bandwidth considered .",

    "this signal can be spot displacements ( for shack - hartmann wfs ) or intensity modulation ( for curvature wfs for example ) .",
    "aliasing is therefore produced by the limited sampling of the measurement in the pupil plane .",
    "two approaches exist to suppress or mitigate aliasing in wfss :    * * increasing the wfs spatial sampling . *",
    "if a good detector ( low readout noise and dark current ) is used , this solution can be highly successful for all but one of the wfs considered in this work .",
    "the single exception is the shack - hartmann wfs , where an increase of spatial sampling in the pupil plane ( smaller subapertures ) increases the measurement error on low - order modes due to photon - noise ( see section  [ sec : wfs_sh ] ) . * * preventing spatial frequencies above @xmath95 to be `` seen '' by the optical part of the wfs .",
    "* this can be done by spatial filtering in the focal plane @xcite or by using an anti - aliasing optical filter before the detector @xcite .",
    "these solutions reduce aliasing on all pupil - plane wfss , and are most effective if the wfs sampling is regular , as is usually the case .",
    "curvature wfss include a focal plane iris at the vibrating membrane ( usually to reduce stray light and sky background ) , which can be used to reduce aliasing in high - strehl regime .",
    "anti - aliasing optical filters are routinely used in imaging with ccds , and are often placed immediately before the detector in commercial digital cameras .",
    "anti - aliasing optical filters with total rejection of high spatial frequencies can be designed @xcite for monochromatic light , and their performance in white light is still good : the solution proposed by @xcite reduces aliasing by a factor 24 with a 20% bandpass .      if the focal plane complex amplitude ( or , equivalently , the aliasing - free pupil plane complex amplitude ) is perfectly known up to a spatial frequency @xmath95 , it is possible to drive a dm to cancel focal plane speckles within a region of the image corresponding to spatial frequencies lower than @xmath95 .",
    "@xcite proposed to use a non - linear minimization algorithm to control the dm . in this work",

    "is tailored at finding the solution of a problem with constraints on both a function ( pupil plane complex amplitude ) and its fourier transform ( focal plane complex amplitude ) , it seems naturally well adapted @xcite .",
    "the steps of the algorithm are shown in figure [ fig : drivedm_algo ] :    * \\(1 ) the region of the focal plane within which the speckles are to be canceled is first chosen .",
    "this `` diffraction control domain '' ( dcd ) should exclude the central part of the psf and should not extend beyond the pupil spatial frequency defined by the dm actuator size or wfs sampling .",
    "this region can be within a half plane if amplitude errors ( scintillation ) in the pupil plane are expected , or can include both sides of the psf for correction of opd aberrations only . *",

    "this algorithm converges very rapidly : only a few iterations are required to obtain a high contrast ( about @xmath97 ) if the initial psf aberrations are low .",
    "it is also computationally less greedy than the solution proposed by @xcite ( the computing time is dominated by 2 fourier transforms ) , and can therefore be implemented in a fast closed loop control system .",
    "example of diffracted light suppression using the algorithm detailed in ",
    "[ sec : dmcontrol ] . in this case , the dm stroke is limited to @xmath98 radian ( @xmath99 radian of phase correction ) , and the initial pupil phase aberration is about 3 radian from peak to peak .",
    "the dm actuators are square - shapes , and their influence functions are overlapping ( each dm influence function is a square convolved by a gaussian ) . in this example , there are 50 actuators across the diameter of the pupil ( 2000 actuators total ) . ]",
    "this algorithm is also very flexible and performs well in non - ideal conditions .",
    "non - ideal dm characteristics such as irregular actuator shapes , `` dead '' actuators or coupled influence functions can easily be included in the algorithm ( step ( 4 ) ) with minimal cost in complexity or computation time .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : dmdrive_perf ] shows that a solution yielding good psf contrast can be found even if the psf has large aberrations and if the dm has insufficient stroke to fully correct them .",
    "this particular example illustrates how the algorithm is able to find a solution for which the diffraction within the dcd is canceled even though the residual phase aberrations in the pupil plane are still large : these aberration are confined to either high or low spatial frequencies , but are very small in the spatial frequency range corresponding to the dcd .",
    "it should be noted that in such non - ideal conditions , the number of iterations ( steps ( 2 ) to ( 5 ) ) required to converge can be quite high ( about 100 in this example ) .      in a closed loop",
    "ao system , the dm control algorithm proposed in  [ sec : dmcontrol ] is used to compute frequent but small updates of the dm : the phase function in the pupil plane needed to cancel the speckles is very small .",
    "the number of iterations ( steps ( 2 ) to ( 5 ) of the algorithm ) required within the algorithm is therefore small ( a single iteration is sufficient ) .",
    "the computing time can consequently be made compatible with khz update rate on modern computers for systems with up to @xmath100 actuators : on a 128x128 actuators system ( 13000 actuators on the circular pupil ) with a focal plane image sampling such that the dcd occupies 256x256 pixels , the time required for the 2 fast fourier transforms is about 1ms on a modern computer .    the number of photons per focal plane speckle is typically less than 10 per sampling period , and the corresponding relative error on the measured complex amplitude of the speckle due to photon noise is more than 10% .",
    "the closed loop performance of the ao correction is therefore not sensitive to small errors introduced by the algorithm described in  [ sec : dmcontrol ] .",
    "even a 5% error in the knowledge of the dm response has a negligible impact on the system performance .",
    "the sensitivity of a wfs is a quantitative measure of how photon noise affects its measurement of opd or amplitude . in this section , the sensitivity @xmath29 of wfss for opd sensing ( when only opd is measured by the wfs ) is computed .",

    "the atmospheric turbulence outer scale @xmath267 , which was not included in the model used in this study , is usually larger than 10 m , and has therefore no direct effect on the psf contrast beyond 005 in the near - ir .",

    "the psf contrast is then driven by the sensitivity of the wfs , and can reach up to @xmath243 in visible / near - ir on a 8 m telescope in the central arcsecond for a bright source . to achieve this level of contrast ,",
    "a high sensitivity wfs should be chosen , and non - common path errors need to be carefully calibrated .",
    "the fpwfs offers high sensitivity ( only surpassed by the zwfs ) and does not suffer from aliasing or non common path errors ( if the same focal plane is used for scientific imaging and wavefront sensing ) .",
    "if amplitude and opd errors are comparable and both need to be measured , fpwfs is in fact as sensitive as the `` ideal '' zwfs .",
    "focal plane wavefront sensing is therefore an extremely attractive solution for high contrast ground - based ao , and i show in this section how it could be implemented .    in order to estimate the complex amplitude in the focal plane , a set of n reference waves",
    "are combined in the focal plane with the speckles .",
    "following the notation adopted in  [ sec : wfs_fp ] , the complex amplitude of the reference wave @xmath268 is noted @xmath269 ( real and imaginary parts ) and is a function of the position in the focal plane . as pointed out in  [ sec : wfs_fp ] , the amplitudes of the reference waves are not important , provided that they are larger than the amplitude of the speckles that need to be sensed , and a minimum of 2 waves are needed to reach optimal performance .",
    "if only 2 waves are used , their phases should be offset by @xmath122 ideally .",
    "as more reference waves are used , the number of nearly - optimal solutions increases and more flexibility in the choice of the reference waves is available .    the reference waves can be produced by phase - shifting of light extracted from the central part of the psf in the focal plane @xcite .",
    "the interference between the speckle cloud and the reference waves is obtained through a mach - zender type interferometer with a beam splitter .",
    "this approach allows to create the optimal reference wave for focal plane wavefront sensing but requires additionnal optics .    a slightly less optimal , but",
    "optically simpler solution is to use the dm to produce the required reference waves .",
    "each reference wave is created by a command sent on the dm : for example , moving a single actuator produces a reference wave of quasi - constant amplitude within the control region , and of phase given by the position of the actuator within the pupil .",
    "provided that the influence functions of the dm and the behaviour of the coronagraph are known , the complex amplitude of the reference wave in the focal plane can be computed to a good accuracy . in a fast closed - loop system , the accuracy with which these reference waves are known does not need to be very high ( about 10% accuracy is sufficient ) to be photon - noise limited .",
    "although the full optimization of the set of reference waves is beyond the scope of this work , i now show that reference waves well suited to focal plane wavefront sensing can be obtained with the dm :    * * extent of reference wave in the focal plane . * the size of a reference wave in the focal plane is set by the size of an actuator of the dm .",
    "it is therefore possible to produce reference waves with relatively high amplitude across all of the diffraction control domain ( dcd , the region in the focal plane for which the dm sampling is sufficient to suppress diffracted light ) . *",
    "* ability to set the amplitude of the reference wave . * small amplitude waves can easily be created by moving a single actuator .",
    "increasing the displacement of this actuator will increase the reference wave amplitude up to @xmath270 of the peak amplitude of the psf for an unapodized pupil , where @xmath271 is the total number of actuators in the dm . for a psf contrast",
    "better than @xmath243 and a dm with more than @xmath272 actuators , actuators need to be moved in groups to produce reference waves of sufficient amplitudes . * * ability to produce an achromatic phase in the reference wave . * a small positive displacement of the center actuator of the dm produces a reference wave of achromatic phase @xmath122 in the focal plane ( @xmath195 for a negative displacement ) .",
    "the amplitude of this reference wave is however chromatic , but this effect will not seriously affect the system performance in a closed - loop system , as it is equivalent to multiplying the signal ( speckle intensity modulation ) by a wavelength - dependent gain of constant sign . the phase of reference waves produced by moving actuators other that the central actuator are also achromatic , provided that a wynne corrector is used .",
    "actuators near the edge of the pupil should preferably not be used to produce the focal plane reference waves , as the resulting phase would vary rapidly across the focal plane image .",
    "the contrast limits derived in  [ sec : wfss ] and  [ sec : perf_disc ] assumed that the only sources of scattered light are the wavefront errors ( phase and amplitude ) in the corrected beam .",
    "these results only apply to optical systems in which the static diffraction ( airy pattern on a circular aperture ) is below the contrast levels derived in this work . in this section ,",
    "i discuss the validity of this approximation , and briefly summarize the options available ( coronagraphy ) to insure that the limits derived in  [ sec : wfss ] and  [ sec : perf_disc ] can be reached .",
    "figure [ fig : contrast_airy ] shows that with an efficient wfs , diffraction associated with the airy pattern is much stronger than light diffracted by residual wavefront errors at small angular separations . at some distance from the optical axis , both contributions are equal . beyond this separation",
    ", coronagraphy is not required to reach the contrast level achievable by the ao system .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : contrast_airy ] , this critical angular separation decreases as the telescope diameter increases . for reasonnable size telescopes ( 100 m diameter or less ) , this critical separation is larger than 2 , and suppression of the airy pattern is therefore required .",
    "psf contrast with an optimal wfs ( @xmath273 ) and airy pattern diffraction for 8 m , 15 m , 30 m , 60 m and 120 m diameter telescopes .",
    "the black circles mark the points where the theoretical psf contrast achievable with a perfect coronagraph equals the airy pattern diffraction contrast level . ]    while light diffracted by residual wavefront errors is time - variable , and might not average nicely with time , the airy diffraction pattern on the other hand is very stable and can be calibrated accurately .",
    "one might therefore wonder if relatively high levels of static diffraction features in the psf are really detrimental to high contrast imaging .",
    "static diffraction actually amplifies the time - variable speckles , an effect referred to as `` speckle pinning '' @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the complex amplitudes of static and dynamic speckles add in the focal plane , and the light intensity @xmath274 measured is : @xmath275 where @xmath276 and @xmath277 are the static and dynamic focal plane intensities , and the phase term between the 2 contribution has been ommited for simplicity . assuming that @xmath276 is well known and can be perfectly subtracted , if @xmath278 ( airy patter is bighter than @xmath36 ) , the `` speckle noise '' becomes dominated by @xmath279 and is therefore @xmath280 stronger than it would be if @xmath281 . in the example considered in figure [",
    "fig : contrast_airy ] , at 05 separation , adding a coronagraph reduces the `` speckle noise '' by factors 52 , 26 and 19 on 8 m , 30 m and 60 m telescopes respectively .    with focal plane wavefront sensing , the static diffraction of the telescope pupil can be treated just as atmospheric speckles , and can therefore be perfectly cancelled in half of the focal plane with a single dm .",
    "the dm phase is then used to cancel the static diffraction ( airy rings for example ) created by the pupil intensity distribution , removing the need for a coronagraph , or at least lowering the requirement on its intrinsic performance .",
    "since the dm phase is chromatic , but the pupil intensity is not , the resulting dark region of the psf is chromatic @xcite and does not allow the use of a wide spectral band .",
    "@xcite however found that solutions with very low chromaticity exist with a square telescope pupil , and similar solutions might exist with circular telescope pupils .",
    "if successfull , this technique could be used instead of a coronagraph in narrow band imaging , and would be optically very simple , provided that the dm can produce the required phase functions : the solutions found by yang and kostinski require a large phase slope at the edge of the pupil .      at large angular separation the coronagraph does not need to attenuate the airy pattern by a large factor ( at most a factor 100 attenuation is required at 05 according to figure [ fig : contrast_airy ] ) , and many suitable coronagraphic options are therefore available .    when observation at small angular separation ( a few @xmath282 ) is required , the choice of the coronagraph is more critical .",
    "coronagraphs with small iwa exist , but are often prone to :    * \\(1 ) sensitivity to tip - tilt and low order modes : this effect is problematic on coronagraphs for which small ( less than @xmath282 ) tip - tilt errors can scatter light at large outside the iwa @xcite .",
    "the coronagraphic leaks are especially large if they are combined with a wfs having poor sensitivity to low - order modes , such as a cwfs or a high - order shwfs .",
    "a fpwfs is preferable if the contrast at very small iwa needs to be optimized .",
    "coronagraphs relying on pupil apodization manage to keep this effect small while offering small iwa @xcite .",
    "* \\(2 ) chromaticity : coronagraphs with small focal plane masks are sensitive to the wavelength - dependent psf scale .",
    "several designs have been proposed to mitigate @xcite or solve @xcite this problem .",
    "* \\(3 ) reduced throughput due to pupil and/or focal plane masks @xcite , or splitting of light @xcite : lossless apodization can be used to avoid this problem @xcite . *",
    "\\(4 ) lower image quality : broader psf due to apodization @xcite or double images @xcite",
    ".    these effects can be especially problematic if the wfs is placed after the coronagraph , as would likely be the case in a fpwfs - based system : chromaticity , reduced throughput and lower image quality would then effectively reduce the wfs signal - to - noise ratio and compromise the achievable contrast ratio .",
    "a thourough comparison of the fundamental contrast limits of ao has shown that visible wavefront sensing does nt allow high accuracy correction of near - ir wavefront aberrations : chromatic effects then limit the psf contrast to @xmath4 to @xmath283 within the central arcsecond .",
    "wavefront sensing should therefore be performed at the same wavelength as imaging to reach the contrast limit imposed by photon noise ( about @xmath254 to @xmath243 in the central arcsecond ) .",
    "an ao system optimized for high contrast , with wavefront sensing and imaging at the same wavelength , can still greatly benefit from a first stage ao correction with a shorter wavelength ( visible ) wfs :    * if residual aberrations are small , a fpwfs can be used efficiently .",
    "this wfs offers unique advantages : no non - common path errors , no aliasing , high sensitivity .",
    "it therefore appears to be the ideal solution for high contrast ao . *",
    "if wavefront correction were perfect at the shorter wavelength , the chromatic residuals that the second wfs needs to measure would be small and relatively slow ( same speed as the uncorrected turbulence ) .",
    "the psf contrast achievable in this case could be better than the limits derived in this work , as more photons are used .",
    "this solution is especially attractive since low - noise fast visible detectors exist , while near - ir detectors currently offer lower performance .",
    "theoretically , combining a fast high sensitivity visible wfs ( preferably a zwfs ) with a slower near - ir wfs ( preferably a fpwfs ) is not as advantageous for red sources as it is for bluer ( spectral type g or bluer ) sources .",
    "the psf contrast estimates derived in this paper represent a limit which is hard to reach , as many optimistic hypothesis have been made : observation at zenith , perfect telescope and detectors , perfect dm , high system throughput , favorable atmospheric conditions , perfect coronagraph , bright @xmath213 source , no time delay for ao control . on a 8 m telescope , psf contrast up to @xmath254",
    "may be reached in the central arcsecond if deviation from these optimistic assumptions is minimal . even on a 100 m telescope ,",
    "the corresponding contrast ( about @xmath284 ) is two orders of magnitude short of what is required to detect an earth - size planet orbitting a solar - type star .",
    "direct imaging of extrasolar planets is therefore bound to rely heavily on efficient calibration of the speckle noise ( through differential imaging techniques for example ) .",
    "the author is thankful to the referee , ren racine , for his detailed and thorough look at this work , which led to many useful suggestions .",
    "in this appendix , i define @xmath29 , the quantitative measure of sensitivity to photon noise of a wfs , and show how it can be derived .",
    "the steps described here were used for each of the wfss considered in this study to compute @xmath29 for a range of spatial frequencies .    the wavefront error given in equation [ equ : phiuv ]",

    "after correction by the dm , the residual sine wave phase aberration at the spatial frequency considered has an amplitude @xmath292 ( in radian ) : @xmath293    in order to compute @xmath175 , the residual phase error in the pupil plane in radians rms , the probability distribution @xmath294 of @xmath288 and @xmath289 can be used : @xmath295    @xmath294 can be written as @xmath296 where @xmath297 is the probability distribution of @xmath288 and @xmath289 given by the measurement @xmath101 .",
    "i denote @xmath298 the variance on the measurement of @xmath101 , for which a gaussian probability law is assumed .",

    "<S> the effects of photon noise , aliasing , wavefront chromaticity and scintillation on the point spread function ( psf ) contrast achievable with ground based adaptive optics ( ao ) are evaluated for different wavefront sensing schemes . </S>",
    "<S> i show that a wavefront sensor ( wfs ) based upon the zernike phase contrast technique offers the best sensitivity to photon noise at all spatial frequencies , while the shack - hartmann wfs is significantly less sensitive . in ao systems performing wavefront sensing in the visible and scientific imaging in the near - ir </S>",
    "<S> , the psf contrast limit is set by the scintillation chromaticity induced by fresnel propagation through the atmosphere . on a 8 m telescope , the psf contrast </S>",
    "<S> is then limited to 1e-4 to 1e-5 in the central arcsecond . </S>",
    "<S> wavefront sensing and scientific imaging should therefore be done at the same wavelength , in which case , on bright sources , psf contrasts between 1e-6 and 1e-7 can be achieved within 1 arcsecond on a 8 m telescope in optical / near - ir . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of atmospheric turbulence parameters ( seeing , wind speed , turbulence profile ) on the psf contrast is quantified . </S>",
    "<S> i show that a focal plane wavefront sensing scheme offers unique advantages , and i discuss how to implement it . </S>",
    "<S> coronagraphic options are also briefly discussed . </S>"
