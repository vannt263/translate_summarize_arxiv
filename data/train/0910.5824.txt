    "the ir background is mainly dominated by luminous and ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs , with total ir [ @xmath17 luminosities @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively )",
    ". however , these populations are progressively less important at lower redshifts , becoming rare by the present epoch .",
    "the most typical ir sources at @xmath20 $ \\sim$}}~}0.7 $ ] are ir normal galaxies , i.e. those with total ir luminosities @xmath21 .",
    "their study is fundamental to clarify the production of the bulk of the ir background in the second half of cosmic time .",
    "our knowledge of ir galaxies at low redshifts was first possible thanks to studies conducted with the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ and the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ ( see e.g. aussel et al .",
    "1999 ; genzel & cesarsky  2000 , for a review ) , which revealed that both star formation and nuclear activity were associated with the dust emission .",
    "more recently , with the advent of the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( werner et al .  2004 ) and",
    "the _ akari telescope _",
    "( matsuhara et al .  2006 ) , a much deeper insight into the nature of the @xmath15 ir galaxy population has been possible .",
    "we have now characterised their luminosity evolution ( e.g. le floch et al .",
    "2005 ; caputi et al .  2007 ;",
    "magnelli et al .",
    "2009 ) , stellar masses ( e.g. caputi et al . 2006a , b ) , and spectral energy distributions ( seds ; e.g. rowan - robinson et al .  2005 ;",

    "spectroscopic surveys at different wavelengths can add very valuable information that help understand the nature of the @xmath15 ir sources .",
    "in addition to providing accurate redshift determinations , spectroscopic data allow us to characterise other aspects of ir galaxies , such as their extinction properties , metallicities and general chemical composition .",
    "the initial optical / near - ir spectroscopic studies of ir galaxies at @xmath15 targeted _ iras _ and _ iso _ sources ( e.g. kim et al .",
    "1995 ; veilleux et al .  1995 , 1999 ; franceschini et al .",
    "2003 ; flores et al .  2004 ; arribas et al .  2008 ; garca - marn et al .",
    "in the _ spitzer _ era , and in the light of larger spectroscopic campaigns , more systematic studies of ir galaxies and their environments have been possible ( e.g. choi et al .",
    "2006 ; papovich et al .  2006 ; caputi et al .",
    "2008 [ c08 hereafter ] , 2009 ; desai et al .",
    ".    in particular , optical spectra are useful to disentangle the power source of the ir emission , which generally occurs when the galaxy dust re - processes the energy provided by the ultra - violet ( uv ) photons of young stars or active nuclei . however , in some cases , the observed ir emission might not be associated with any on - going stellar or nuclear activity , but be rather produced by dust heated by old stars ( e.g. gordon et al .",
    "2000 ; kong et al .",
    "2004 ; cortese et al .  2006",
    "; but also see young et al .",
    "2009 ) , or even direct stellar emission .",
    "the importance of these mechanisms within the ir galaxy population is not yet well established .",
    "the identification of ` passive ' ir sources is important to quantify the degree of contamination in the ir - derived cosmic star formation rate densities .",
    "spectroscopic data can be very helpful to elucidate the presence of star formation in sources that are presumably dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "spectral features also carry the imprints of the galaxy star formation history .",
    "thus , for ir galaxies , optical spectra can be used to investigate at what stage of the galaxy history the ir phase is produced .",
    "locally , the rare lirgs and ulirgs are known to be mainly the consequence of galaxy mergers that induce bursts of star formation and nuclear activity ( e.g. armus et al .",
    "2007 ) . instead",
    ", more typical ir galaxies at @xmath22 are usually less disturbed , and appear to form their stars in a more regular way .",
    "there are several clues that suggest that , in the past , when lirgs and ulirgs were more common , both the burst - like and quiescent modes of star formation could also lead to the ir phase ( e.g. elbaz et al .  2007 ;",
    "daddi et al .",
    "2008 ) . in spite of these different pieces of evidence ,",
    "it is not yet clearly established whether there exists a transition in the possible modes of star formation between galaxies of different ir luminosities .",
    "one of the main aims of this work is to study such a transition in ir galaxies at @xmath12 .    the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; scoville et al .",
    "2007 ) has been designed to probe galaxy evolution , star formation and the effects of large - scale structure up to high redshifts .",

    "we focus on the analysis of those spectra in which the two main balmer lines @xmath6and @xmath7are simultaneously present , as their flux ratio provides information on the dust obscuration affecting the on - going star formation in ir galaxies . with this purpose , and",
    "willing to avoid measuring lines both in the fringing region and the blue edge of the spectra , we performed simultaneous @xmath6and @xmath7measurements only for the 204 ir galaxies that lie at @xmath4 within our sample ( none of which is classified as a blagn ) .",
    "we corrected both the @xmath6and @xmath7emission line measurements for stellar absorption .",
    "we estimated the stellar absorption correction in each case by fitting the continuum of each spectrum with synthetic stellar seds from the bruzual & charlot 2007 library ( bruzual & charlot  2003 ; bruzual  2007 ) .",
    "we also applied aperture corrections to account for the fact that the slits in the _ vimos _ masks have a width of only 1 arcsec . to obtain the aperture corrections",
    ", we convolved each zcosmos spectrum in our sample with the _ subaru suprime - cam _ @xmath74 and @xmath38-band filters , and compared the resulting magnitudes with the total magnitudes of our galaxies , as available in the cosmos optical photometry catalogues ( capak et al .  2007 ) .    within our sample at @xmath4 ,",
    "189 out of 204 ( @xmath7592% ) galaxies have @xmath6@xmath76 ( before stellar absorption correction ) .",
    "this means that these galaxies have an on - going star formation that is significant with respect to the underlying stellar population .",
    "the remaining 15 galaxies with @xmath6@xmath77 will be analysed later , but we anticipate that only among them can we expect to have sources in which the ir emission is likely to be associated with dust heated by old stars rather than uv photons from on - going star formation .",
    "the adopted limit ( @xmath78 ) to separate our galaxy sample is the same as the one we used in c08 and , of course , is arbitrary .",
    "however , no result or conclusion in this work depends on the exact value of that limit .    among the 189 @xmath0galaxies with @xmath6@xmath79 at @xmath4 , 94 also have @xmath7@xmath79 , while the other 95 have lower @xmath7ew values",
    "this is not very surprising as , even in the absence of extinction , there is no reason for both @xmath6and @xmath7ews to be similar .",
    "their ratio depends on the galaxy age and star formation history ( because they determine the slope of the continuum between the @xmath6and @xmath7wavelengths ) .",
    "in addition , any possible differential extinction between gas and stars could also influence the ew ratio .",
    "we discuss in more detail the extinction properties of these sources in section [ sec_dust ] .",
    "although here we classify our galaxies according to their @xmath6and @xmath7ews ( which measure the relative importance of the on - going and the past integrated star formation histories ) , it is instructive to see the behaviour of these quantities with respect to the line luminosities ( figure [ fig_ewlum ] ) .",
    "globally , the ews and luminosities relate to each other , although with non - negligible dispersion .",
    "this is both due to the different optical continuum levels in ir galaxies , and the spectral measurement errors .    in this section ,",
    "our main interest is to investigate whether ir galaxies with different balmer line ews can be recognised by their optical broad - band colours , and how , in general , the optical colour distribution of ir galaxies compares with the colour distribution of the entire zcosmos 10k sample .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure [ fig_bmihisto ] shows the distribution of the observed @xmath80 colours for all zcosmos - bright 10k galaxies at @xmath4 , compared to the colour distribution for the @xmath0/zcosmos sources ( note that the number of all zcosmos - bright galaxies is renormalised to 204 to coincide with the number of @xmath0/zcosmos sources in this redshift range ) . on the right - hand panel ,",
    "we plot the respective @xmath80 colour distributions for the @xmath0/zcosmos sources with @xmath6and @xmath7@xmath76 ; @xmath6@xmath76 and @xmath7@xmath77 ; and both @xmath77 . in all cases ,",
    "the @xmath80 are total ( i.e. aperture - corrected ) colours measured on the _ subaru suprime - cam _",
    "images for cosmos ( taniguchi et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the comparison of these different histograms clearly shows that , while the overall zcosmos galaxy population at @xmath4 displays a bimodal colour distribution , this bimodality is not seen for the ir sources .",
    "this is basically due to the relatively higher fraction of ` green valley ' @xmath81 galaxies within the @xmath0sample , and lower fraction of blue @xmath82 galaxies , which suggests that the zcosmos sources detected at @xmath0are on average more obscured .    when we analyse the @xmath80 colour distributions for the ir galaxy samples with different values of @xmath6and @xmath7ews , we see the following : those galaxies with both @xmath6and @xmath7@xmath76 make most ( @xmath49 75% ) of the optically - blue @xmath82 ir galaxies . instead",
    ", the ` green valley ' and red ir galaxies are mainly sources with @xmath7@xmath77 ( 58% and 78% , respectively ) .",
    "therefore , although there is no one - to - one relation between the line ews and the broad - band flux ratios , one can roughly predict the spectral characteristics of ir galaxies according to their different optical colours .",
    "a similar conclusion can be extracted by plotting the observed @xmath80 colours as a function of the balmer decrement @xmath83 ( figure [ fig_bmivshahb ] ) . in this diagram , it is clear that galaxies with @xmath7@xmath77 dominate the region defined by @xmath84 .",
    "the vast majority of our @xmath0galaxies display @xmath6/@xmath7values above the intrinsic ratio in the typical case b recombination with @xmath85 ( i.e. @xmath6/@xmath7@xmath862.87 ; osterbrock 1989 ) , independently of their optical colours , indicating in all cases significant dust attenuations .",

    "the stacked spectra of the sources with @xmath7@xmath77 , classified according to their @xmath80 colours , are useful to summarise the average spectral properties ( figure [ fig_stackhanohb ] ) .",
    "these stacks show that the balmer line ews become smaller for redder colours , with the ( uncorrected ) @xmath7ew ranging from @xmath89 for the @xmath82 stack , to @xmath90 for that with @xmath91 .",
    "the average stellar - absorption - corrected @xmath83 ratio varies from @xmath92 to @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "our @xmath0/zcosmos galaxy sample at @xmath4 contains 15 sources whose individual @xmath6ews are smaller than @xmath96 .",
    "this indicates that either the on - going star formation in these galaxies is insignificant with respect to their integrated past star formation history , or that there is a very different degree of extinction in the gas associated with the new star formation and the old stars responsible for the continuum light . in this section",
    ", we investigate in detail the properties of these galaxies , and discuss in particular the origin of their ir emission .",

    "we have produced these tracks by measuring the @xmath10 ew and @xmath11 parameter on galaxy synthetic seds generated with the galaxev code and the 2007 version of the bruzual & charlot models ( bruzual & charlot  2003 ; bruzual  2007 ) .",
    "all these tracks are plotted only up to ages @xmath168 6 gyr , as this is approximately the age of the universe at @xmath32 .",
    "as we have discussed in c08 , the average position of the most luminous ir galaxies in the @xmath10 ew - @xmath11 diagram can not be reproduced by any of these simple @xmath165-decaying star formation histories .",
    "our present analysis confirms that this is the case for galaxies with total ir luminosities @xmath169 ( squares with the two largest sizes in figure [ fig_hddn4 ] ) . instead",
    ", secondary bursts of star formation in galaxies with underlying old ( @xmath170 $ \\sim$}}~}3 \\ , \\rm gyr$ ] ) stellar populations appear as a plausible mechanism to explain the spectral characteristics of these most luminous ir sources ( thin solid lines in figure [ fig_hddn4 ] ) .",
    "we note that bursts producing 5 - 10% of the galaxy stellar mass are sufficient to drastically move the position of a few - gyr - old galaxy in the diagram from @xmath171 $ \\sim$}}~}1.5 $ ] to @xmath155 .",
    "interestingly , although the average ( @xmath10 ew;@xmath11 ) points for the most luminous ir galaxies with @xmath172 do seem to be consistent with @xmath165-decaying models , they intersect their tracks at ages @xmath173 gyr . as it is quite unlikely that there exist many of such young galaxies at @xmath12 , the scenario of secondary bursts of star formation is still the most reasonable to explain the properties of these sources .",
    "this argument is supported by the fact that the stacked spectra of these galaxies show some signatures of old underlying stellar populations , such as the presence of caii h & k absorption lines .",
    "also , these sources are known to have already assembled intermediate - to - large stellar masses ( @xmath174 $ \\sim$}}~}1 \\times 10^{10 } \\ , \\rm m_{\\odot}$ ] ; see e.g. caputi et al .",
    "2006a ) , suggesting that we are not witnessing their first episode of star formation .    as we discussed before , for the less luminous ir ( @xmath175 ) galaxies ( squares of the two smallest sizes in figure [ fig_hddn4 ] ) , the @xmath11 parameter has a wider range of values .",
    "taking into account their average position in the @xmath10 ew - @xmath11 diagram and other features in the stacked spectra , we can obtain clues on the star formation histories of the sources in different @xmath11 bins .",
    "the sources with @xmath172 are characterised by an average spectra with relatively weak absorption lines , and an @xmath10 line with ew @xmath176 (",
    "that , in the case of the less luminous ir galaxies , is actually observed in emission ; see upper panels in figure [ fig_stdn4lt12 ] ) .",
    "they also show a prominent [ oii ] emission line and , those with @xmath177 , a modest but significant [ neiii ] line .",
    "these spectral characteristics , and the resulting average position of these sources in the @xmath10 ew -@xmath11 diagram , suggest that these are either really young galaxies or , more likely , they are experiencing a major secondary burst of star formation that hides any plausible older stellar component .",
    "note that the ionisation lines could also be the consequence of the presence of agn .",
    "however , only one of these sources is detected in the x - ray catalogues for the cosmos field , and only two have an irac power - law sed ( one of which is the x - ray source ) .",
    "the sources with @xmath175 in the @xmath178 bin are characterised by quite different average stacked spectra ( lower panels in figure [ fig_stdn4lt12 ] ) .",
    "these galaxies display prominent caii h & k absorption lines , indicating that the underlying old stellar component is important .",
    "their average position in the diagram at ( extinction - corrected ) @xmath179 seems compatible with some of the @xmath165-decaying models at young ( @xmath180 gyr ) ages .",
    "however , the optical spectra indicate that these galaxies are very probably older .",
    "thus , once more , secondary bursts are the most plausible mechanism for the on - going star formation in these objects .    the stacking points indicating @xmath175 galaxies at @xmath181 in figure [ fig_hddn4 ] correspond to a different situation .",
    "all these points intersect the @xmath165-decaying model tracks at ages @xmath182 gyr , so such models allow for the underlying old stellar component that is present in these galaxies . at the same time , although the sfr is exponentially declining , it is still sufficient to explain the observed average [ oii ] fluxes ( cf . figure [ fig_oiidn4 ] ) .",
    "for example , the stacking point for @xmath183 galaxies at @xmath184 and @xmath10 ew@xmath185 is consistent with a @xmath186 gyr model at an age @xmath187 gyr . by that time ,",
    "the initial sfr has decayed by a factor of @xmath188 .",
    "this situation is feasible : a galaxy that started its life being a ulirg would still be producing a few @xmath189 1.4 gyr later .    also , the stacking point at @xmath190 could be well explained by the model of a 6 gyr - old galaxy with a much slower sfr decaying time ( see the @xmath191 gyr track in figure [ fig_hddn4 ] ) . in spite of being quite old ,",
    "the sfr of such a galaxy is still non - negligible ( @xmath192 times its initial value ) .",
    "thus , this model simultaneously accounts for the absorption lines and [ oii ] emission observed in the average spectrum .",
    "it is important to remark that the fact that @xmath165-decaying models are able to explain the spectral characteristics of these less luminous ir galaxies , the secondary - burst scenario can not be excluded . in all cases",
    ", one can find the right combination of burst amplitude and onset age ( i.e. the age of the galaxy when the burst is produced ) , in order to reproduce the average location of galaxies with different @xmath11 values in the @xmath10 ew - @xmath11 diagram .    the ir galaxies for which @xmath165-decaying models offer a good explanation for the on - going star formation ( i.e. those with un - corrected @xmath193 ) constitute @xmath49 40% of our @xmath175 sample at @xmath12 .",
    "this result clearly shows that a quiescent mode of star formation can drive the ir emission in a significant fraction of the less luminous lirgs and ir normal galaxies .",
    "although the average spectra of most @xmath0galaxies at @xmath12 are characterised by having high - order balmer lines such as @xmath10 in absorption , in some objects those lines are present in emission .",
    "a significant @xmath10 emission is expected for galaxies at the very early stages ( @xmath194 years ) of a new burst of star formation , when the @xmath10 absorption associated with intermediate - age stars is still not sufficient to compensate the emission produced by the youngest ones .    as we explained in c08 and in section [ sec_irphstack ] of this present paper ,",
    "the @xmath10 ew measurements on the spectra of our ir galaxies generally have too low signal - to - noise ratios as to safely consider them on an individual basis . in spite of this fact",
    ", we used our tentative @xmath10 ew measurements and secure @xmath11 values to select galaxies that are candidates to be hosting young starbursts .",
    "our present sample of 1587 faint @xmath0galaxies at @xmath12 contains 31 galaxies with @xmath195 that have @xmath10 ew@xmath196 and @xmath197 ( i.e. @xmath10 is securely in emission ) .",
    "these galaxies constitute 18% of all our faint sources with @xmath195 at @xmath12 , and around 3% of those that are within @xmath198 yr of a new burst of star formation ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig_hddn4 ] ) .",
    "so , the clear cases of galaxies hosting very young starbursts constitute a minor fraction of our ir sample ( we extracted a similar conclusion for brighter ir sources in c08 ) .",
    "there are two alternative explanations for this situation .",
    "one possibility is that the ir phase is not equally likely within the first @xmath198 yr of a new burst , i.e. galaxies containing very young bursts are still too faint to be detected at ir wavelengths .",
    "the other possibility is that the earliest stages of star formation are heavily obscured .",
    "if only the gas had a very large extinction , the observed @xmath10 emission would be weak , and the @xmath10 ew@xmath196 cut could be missing young starburts . if both the gas and stars were very obscured , the galaxies would look faint in the optical wavebands and , in that case , they could simply be missed by the zcosmos - bright @xmath199 ab mag selection .",
    "in this paper , we have identified 3244 @xmath0-selected galaxies with @xmath1 $ \\sim$}}~}0.50 \\ , \\rm mjy$ ] within the zcosmos - bright 10k sample , and studied different optical spectral properties depending on their redshifts .",
    "our sample spans e.g. total ir luminosities @xmath200 at @xmath29 , and @xmath201 at @xmath32 .",
    "this means that our sources are ir normal galaxies at @xmath202 , and a mixture of ir normal galaxies and lirgs at @xmath203 .",
    "this works complements our previous study of the zcosmos - bright spectra of more luminous ir galaxies at similar redshifts ( c08 ) .",
    "the fainter luminosity range studied here is particularly important , as it contains the bulk of the ir background energy at these redshifts .    for galaxies at @xmath4",
    ", we took advantage of the simultaneous presence of the @xmath6and @xmath7lines in the zcosmos spectra to study the relation between line emission , broad - band colours and dust extinction .",
    "we also discussed the possibility for the ir emission to be associated with dust heated by old rather than young stellar populations .",
    "we summarise our results as follows :    @xmath204 92% of our @xmath0galaxies at @xmath4 have @xmath6ew@xmath205 , which indicates that the vast majority of ir sources at these redshifts are associated with significant on - going star formation .    in most of these sources ,",
    "the relation between the gas obscuration , i.e. @xmath206 , and ir / uv attenuation can be reasonably explained with different reddening laws of common use in the literature . however , for up to 16% of our sample at @xmath4 , the balmer decrement is much larger than predicted by any of these laws .",
    "we believe that this is produced by a combination of an inhomogenous dust distribution and the fact that the zcosmos spectra only receive the light from a 1-arcsec width slit centred at the source .",
    "the presence of a very obscured star - forming region towards the centre can produce very high @xmath206 ratios .",
    "we note that this effect should be much less important at higher redshifts , where the 1-arcsec width covered by the _ vimos _ slit collects a more representative fraction of the total galaxy light .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize that , although the broad - band seds of many low - redshift ir galaxies are dominated by old stellar populations , the optical spectra reveal the presence of on - going star formation in most cases .",
    "thus , for these galaxies , one can not conclude that the ir light is produced by dust heated by old stars .",
    "more likely , the young stellar component is the main energy source for the ir emission . of course",
    ", this does not exclude the possibility that the old stars have a minor contribution to the dust heating .",
    "@xmath204 although there is no one - to - one relation between the @xmath6and @xmath7emission and the galaxy optical broad - band colours , around 80% of the objects with @xmath6and @xmath7ew @xmath205 are in the blue ( @xmath207 ) cloud , and",
    "around 70% of those with @xmath7ew @xmath208 are in the ` green valley ' or redder ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "@xmath204 the location in the bpt diagram of our galaxies with @xmath6ew @xmath205 suggests that @xmath210 of them are composite systems .",
    "however , in none of these galaxies can the presence of an active nucleus be confirmed with the x - ray or _ irac _",
    "data available in the cosmos field .",
    "this fact suggests that , although an agn component might be present in these galaxies , in any case is not dominant , and that aperture effects could also influence the fraction of sources identified as composites .",
    "@xmath204 we identified only 5 galaxies in our sample at @xmath4 which have no spectral signs of star formation and , besides , have elliptical or lenticular morphologies .",
    "we believe that these are the only candidates in our sample at @xmath4 for which most of the ir emission could genuinely be produced by dust heated by old rather than new stellar populations .    the second part of our analysis has been devoted to galaxies at @xmath126 .",
    "we used the zcosmos spectra to determine oxygen abundances , measure the @xmath11 parameter and the average @xmath10 ews .",
    "our results are the following :    @xmath204 79% of our galaxies with @xmath7ew @xmath205 at @xmath9 have degenerate metallicity values .",
    "this is a consequence of estimating metallicities based on only three emission lines ( through the @xmath128 parameter ) .",
    "when we place these galaxies in a stellar mass - metallicity diagram , we see that the upper - branch solution is compatible with the mass - metallicity relation in the local universe within the error bars .",
    "this implies that our data do not allow us to conclude on any evolution of the mass - metallicity relation between @xmath211 and @xmath212 . among the 21% of galaxies with non - degenerate metallicity measurements",
    ", we find that more than a half are well below the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "over our total ir - galaxy population at @xmath9 , they put a secure lower limit of 12% to the fraction of outliers to this relation .",
    "this percentage is quite smaller than that observed for lirgs and ulirgs by c08 .",
    "however , the comparison of our results with those for optically - selected galaxies with similar stellar masses and well - determined metallicities suggests that the 12% fraction is indeed a lower limit .",
    "@xmath204 in contrast to the results for more luminous ir galaxies , we find that our present sample at @xmath12 displays a wide range of @xmath11 values .",
    "still , @xmath213% of our sources have un - corrected ( corrected ) @xmath155 .",
    "@xmath204 a combined analysis of our present faint ir sample and previous c08 brighter sample at @xmath12 has allowed us to investigate the possible modes of star formation in ir galaxies .",
    "the burst - like mode of star formation is necessary to simultaneously explain the different average spectral properties of the most luminous ir galaxies ( @xmath214 $ \\sim$}}~}3\\times 10^{11 } \\ , \\rm l_\\odot$ ] ) . instead , for nearly 40% of the less luminous lirgs and most luminous ir normal galaxies , a continuous",
    ", quiescent star - formation mode is possible .",
    "realistically , the @xmath26 for the transition at @xmath12 should be considered to be @xmath215 , to take into account the errors in the determination of the total ir luminosities and the data binning .",
    "our findings are consistent with other recent results in the literature , which indicate that around a half of ir galaxies of intermediate luminosities at @xmath216 are typical disks that do not show any sign of disturbance ( see e.g. elbaz et al .",
    "they could also be explained in the scenario proposed by theoretical studies that suggest that some galaxies could have had a star formation history characterised by steady gas flows since early times ( dekel et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in summary ,",
    "our optical spectral analysis has clearly shown the diverse nature of the galaxies that make the bulk of the mid - ir background at @xmath15 . and , even when star formation seems to be the most important driver of the ir emission at these redshifts , ir galaxies are characterised by a complex variety of star formation histories .",
