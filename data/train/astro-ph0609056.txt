    "many globular clusters do show some amount of rotation , even the old ones of our own galaxy ( @xcite and some ten others , k. gebhardt , personal communication ) .",
    "the more accurate and star - by - star observations become available , the more important it is to properly model the effects of rotation together with evolution of globular star clusters , since typically the amount of rotational energy in clusters is not dominant , but also not negligible .",
    "it is long known that indeed flattenings of galactic globular clusters correlates with their rotation , suggesting that rotation still is important for the shape @xcite .",
    "proper motions of stars in @xmath0 cen have been measured to get a real 3d profile of stellar motions including rotation , and in fantastic improvements of observations using the hubble space telescope it became even possible to measure rotation of 47 tuc in the plane of the sky @xcite . while without rotation the wealth of observational data such as luminosity functions and derived mass functions , color - magnitude diagrams , and population and kinematical analysis , obtained by e.g. the hubble space telescope , for extragalactic as well as milky way clusters ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , to mention only the few most recently appeared papers ) , is balanced by a decent amount of detailed modelling ( see below ) , theorists and observers alike seem to be appallingly puzzled by rotation in clusters , and are disappointed that ( multi - mass ) king model fitting does not work very well ( see e.g. @xcite , and for a specific example @xcite , therein ) .",
    "one notable exception being the early three - integral models by @xcite nobody seemed to care about rotation in globular cluster modelling since then for a long time .",
    "there was a thesis by jeremy goodman @xcite , whose part on rotation of clusters remained unpublished , but who was the pioneer for the main idea to use a two - dimensional approximation using the distribution function as function of energy @xmath1 and @xmath2-component of angular momentum @xmath3 , and neglect the possible dependencies on a third integral @xmath4 for the time being .",
    "unfortunately the solution of the 2d orbit averaged fokker - planck ( henceforth fp ) equation , including the self - consistent numerical determination of diffusion coefficients , is an extremely complex numerical problem , involving two levels of numerical integrations in a second order integro - differential equations , in other words we need 4d nested discretization in @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath2 where the latter are the spatial coordinates .",
    "it turned out that the problem was too challenging in the mid - eighties for the then available computers . with the help of goodman , who kindly made his phd thesis available at an early stage ,",
    "@xcite could re - write from scratch a new fp code and publish a sequence of rotating cluster models ( pre - collapse , equal masses ) .",
    "these studies have been recently improved in a comprehensive effort on the fp side @xcite , and also promising results exist which show that the neglect of the third integral does not harm too much ( if flattening is not extreme ) , since there is fair agreement with direct @xmath6-body models ( see some examples in and @xcite ) . in a new approach ( @xcite ) we are working to back up the amount of good @xmath6-body data for rotating clusters by a large number of small @xmath6 averaged models and a few large models , as was done for the non - rotating case by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is clear that while all work known to the authors at this moment concentrates on self - gravitating star clusters , the improvement of our knowledge and methods in the field of rotating dense stellar systems is extremely important for galactic nuclei , too , where a central star - accreting black hole comes into the game ( some stationary modelling exists , such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "also , claims have been made that some globular clusters in the halo of our galaxy and around m31 contain massive black holes @xcite , and these results have been challenged by @xcite .",
    "however , the latest paper could only provide a very limited number of case studies , due to the enormous computing time needed even on the grape computers .",
    "therefore it is very urgent to develop reliable approximate models of rotating star clusters with black hole , which is subject of current work .",
    "dynamical modelling of globular clusters and other collisional stellar systems ( like galactic nuclei , rich open clusters , and rich galaxy clusters ) still poses a considerable challenge for both theory and computational requirements ( in hardware and software ) . on the theoretical side",
    "the validity of certain assumptions used in statistical modelling based on the fp and other approximations is still poorly known .",
    "stochastic noise in a discrete @xmath6-body system and the impossibility to directly model realistic particle numbers with the presently available hardware , are a considerable challenge for the computational side .",
    "a large amount of individual pairwise forces between particles needs to be explicitly calculated to properly follow relaxation effects based on the cumulative effects of small angle gravitative encounters",
    ". therefore modelling of globular star clusters over their entire lifetime requires a star - by - star simulation approach , which is highly accurate in following stellar two- and many - body encounters .",
    "distant two  body encounters , the backbone of quasi - stationary relaxation processes , have to be treated properly by the integration method directly , while close encounters , in order to avoid truncation errors and downgrading of the overall performance , are treated in relative and specially regularized coordinates @xcite , their centers of masses being used in the main integrator .",
    "the factual world standard of such codes has been set by aarseth and his codes nbody@xmath7-codes ( @xmath8 , see @xcite ) .",
    "another integrator kira aimed at high - precision has been used @xcite .",
    "it uses a hierarchical binary tree to handle compact subsystems instead of regularization .",
    "unfortunately , the direct simulation of most dense stellar systems with star - by - star modelling is not yet possible , although recent years have seen a significant progress in both hardware and software @xcite .",
    "despite such progress in hardware and software even the largest useful direct @xmath6-body models for both globular cluster and galactic nuclei evolution have still not yet reached the realistic particle numbers ( @xmath9 for globular clusters , @xmath10 to @xmath11 for galactic nuclei ) .",
    "however , recent work by @xcite and @xcite has pushed the limits of present direct modelling for the first time to some @xmath12 using either nbody6++ on parallel computers or nbody4 on grape-6 special purpose hardware .",
    "there is a notable exception of a direct one - million body problem with a central binary black hole tackled by @xcite .",
    "their code , however , being very innovative for the large @xmath6 force calculation , still lacks the fine ingredients of treating close encounters between stars and black hole particles from the standard @xmath6-body codes .",
    "bridging the gap between direct models and the most interesting particle numbers in real systems is far from straightforward , neither by scaling @xcite , nor by theory .",
    "there are two main classes of theory : ( i ) fp models , which are based on the direct numerical solution of the orbit - averaged fp equation @xcite , and ( ii ) isotropic @xcite and anisotropic gaseous models @xcite , which can be thought of as a set of moment equations of the fp equation .    on the side of the direct fp models",
    "there have been two major recent developments .",
    "@xcite has published new fp models for spherically symmetric star clusters , based on the numerical solution of the orbit - averaged 2d fp equation ( solving the fp equation for the distribution @xmath13 as a function of energy and angular momentum , on an @xmath14-mesh ) .",
    "@xcite have published results from another 2d fp code based on the original cohn ( 1979 ) code . in such 2d fp models",
    "anisotropy , i.e. the possible difference between radial and tangential velocity dispersions in spherical clusters , is taken into account .",
    "secondly , another 2d fp model has been worked out recently for the case of axisymmetric rotating star clusters . here",
    ", the distribution function is assumed to be a function of energy @xmath1 and the @xmath2-component of angular momentum @xmath3 only ; a possible dependence of the distribution function on a third integral is neglected . as in the spherically symmetric case",
    "the neglection of an integral of motion is equivalent to the assumption of isotropy , here between the velocity dispersions in the meridional plane ( @xmath15 and @xmath2 directions ) ; anisotropy between velocity dispersion in the meridional plane and that in the equatorial plane ( @xmath16-direction ) , however , is included .",
    "we realize that the evolutionary models provided by us for rotating globular clusters are difficult to use for direct comparisons with observations , because they are not easily analytically describable .",
    "but they are the only ones which fully cope with _ all _ observational data available nowadays ( full 3d velocity data , including velocity dispersions in @xmath5 and @xmath16-direction , rotational velocity , density , all as full 2d functions of @xmath5 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "no other evolutionary model exists so far which is able to provide this information . with the advent of our new post - collapse and multi - mass models and the inclusion of stellar evolution and binaries ( work in progress )",
    "we will be able to deliver even more interesting results .",
    "already the existing @xmath6-body study @xcite shows that rotation not only accelerates the collisional evolution but also leads to an increasing binary activity in the system .    here",
    "we present a detailed and comprehensive set of our model data , covering a fair range of rotation rates and initial concentrations of galactic globular clusters , which is aimed to enable observers to use them for comparison with their data .",
    "the basic idea is to start up with a dynamical cluster age and a present day observed flattening , and then being able to pick a number of models from our evolutionary model data base which allow a prediction ( within certain ambiguity ) of how this clusters started up initially . in this paper",
    "we present the basic procedure of modelling and how we create the data , and give a few exemplary data to show the capabilities of our data base which is to be found in the web ( http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/clusterdata ) .",
    "2 and 3 summarize briefly the numerical and physical procedure used for our evolving rotating cluster models , and the choice of initial conditions .",
    "4 describes the comprehensive set of data we provide for every of our models using one example set , and sect .",
    "5 shows how observational data can be used to obtain the proper entry points in our data for a more detailed theory - observation comparison .",
    "the stellar system is assumed to be axisymmetric ( cylindrical coordinates @xmath17 were used ) and in dynamical equilibrium . therefore , the distribution function @xmath18 is almost constant on the dynamical time scale . the only classical isolating integrals of a general axisymmetric potential @xmath16",
    "are the energy per unit mass : @xmath19 and the component of angular momentum along the z - axis per unit mass : @xmath20 ( @xmath1 , @xmath16 are negative for bound particles ) + the boltzmann equation written in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath3 has to be evaluated in the code : @xmath21 @xmath22 is the distribution function in axial symmetry . here @xmath4 represents a third integral , which is neglected in the model ( see paper i for a discussion of possible errors ) .    small angle scattering @xmath23 is a condition for the expansion of the fp approximation .",
    "diffusion coefficients of 3 . and higher order are neglected .",
    "thus , the collision term on the right side of eq.3 is given by : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the volume element given by @xmath28 .",
    "due to the relation @xmath29 ( for globular clusters is @xmath30 ) , the orbit will spread only on a relaxation timescale ( because of encounters and assuming a conserved third integral ) .",
    "therefore , an orbit - average of the fp equation is taken over an area in the meridional plane that intersects the hypersurface in phase space with the same @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the physical variables @xmath1 and @xmath3 are transformed to the suitable dimensionless quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the choice of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the energy of a circular orbit at the core radius of the cluster , guarantees a good resolution in energy space both for small energies and for the energy belonging to the central particles .",
    "@xmath35 is a dimensionless @xmath2-component of angular momentum ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "a rectangular mesh is generated on which the fp equation is discretized .",
    "the models presented use a number grid size in ( @xmath37 ) of ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the relative error in energy conservation using this configuration is less than 0.7 per cent .",
    "the orbit - averaged flux coefficients are derived from the local diffusion coefficients , which are found for the axial symmetric geometry via the prescriptions of @xcite involving covariant derivatives instead of the procedure employed by goodman ( 1983 ) using a non - covariant form .",
    "the derivation of the diffusion coefficients makes it necessary to specify a background distribution function by which test stars are scattered .",
    "using the foreground distribution for the background self - consistently would require computational time proportional to @xmath39 , where the @xmath40 are grid sizes in coordinate and velocity space , which would reduce the grids employed to inaccurate descriptions of the current problem ; thus , as in all previous applications concerning 2-dimensional fokker - planck methods for stellar systems , we set up an appropriate form of the background distribution .",
    "herein we follow @xcite , giving a rotating maxwellian velocity distribution to the background , thereby reducing the computational efforts necessary .",
    "the following steps are taken in the code :    * construction of initial rotating king - models ( initial potential @xmath41 and density @xmath42 pairs are computed ) * the evolution due to stellar collisions is calculated in the fp step using the method described by @xcite , while @xmath41 is constant * recalculation of @xmath43 due to slow changes in the potential ( vlasov - step ) .",
    "the initial models are rotating king models of the form : @xmath44 initial parameters are :          time units are defined as follows : + dynamical time @xmath50 @xcite : @xmath51 where , @xmath52 is the initial total cluster mass ; @xmath53 , the initial core radius ; @xmath6 is the total number of particles and @xmath54 ( ln @xmath55 is the coulomb logarithm ) .",
    "the gravitational constant @xmath56 is set to 1 .    the initial half mass relaxation time is defined as @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the initial half mass radius .",
    "following the condition @xmath59 , evolution of @xmath60 can be calculated as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the current total mass and half - mass radius .",
    "the cluster radius is given by @xmath64    the dynamical ellipticity @xmath65 of the cluster is calculated following @xcite , as @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the rotational energy , @xmath69 is the energy contained in the azimuthal component of the velocity dispersion and @xmath70 is the energy of all components of the velocity dispersion .          1 .",
