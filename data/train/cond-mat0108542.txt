    "the small - world model has been introduced by watts and strogatz  @xcite as a simple model of a social network  a network of friendships or acquaintances between individuals , for instance , or a network of physical contacts between people through which a disease spreads .",
    "the model consists of a regular lattice , typically a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions although lattices of two or more dimensions have been studied as well , with a small number of `` shortcut '' bonds added between randomly chosen pairs of sites , with density @xmath0 per bond on the original regular lattice .",
    "the small - world model captures two specific features observed in real - world networks , namely ( 1 )  logarithmically short distances through the network between most pairs of individuals and ( 2 )  high network clustering , meaning that two individuals are much more likely to be friends with one another if they have one or more other friends in common .",
    "the model turns out to be amenable to treatment using a variety of techniques drawn from statistical physics and has as a result received wide attention in the physics community  @xcite .",
    "the small - world model has some problems however .",
    "in particular , it is built on a low - dimensional regular lattice , and there is little justification to be found in empirical studies of social networks for such an underlying structure . as recently pointed out by warren  @xcite , however , there is one case in which the small - world model may be a fairly accurate representation of a real - world situation , and that is in the spread of plant diseases .",
    "plant diseases spread through physical contacts between plants  immediate contagion , insect vectors , wind , and so forth  and these contacts form a `` social network '' among the plants in question .",
    "however , plants are sessile , and confined by and large to the two - dimensional plane of the earth s surface .",
    "disease spread as a result of short - range contact between plants is thus probably well represented as a transmission process on a simple two - dimensional lattice , and disease spread in which some portion of transmission is due to longer - range vectors such as wind or insects may be well represented by a small - world model built upon an underlying two - dimensional lattice .",
    "because of this , as well as because of inherent mathematical interest , a number of recent papers have focused on two - dimensional small - world networks  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study bond percolation on two - dimensional small - world networks .",
    "bond percolation is equivalent to the standard susceptible / infectious / recovered ( sir ) model of disease spread  @xcite , in which all individuals are initially susceptible to the disease , become infected ( and hence infectious ) with some probability per unit time if one of their neighbors is infectious , and recover again , becoming uninfectious and also immune , after a certain time in the infectious state .",
    "the equivalence of the sir model to percolation is straightforward , with the percolation threshold mapping to the epidemic threshold of the disease in the sir model , and cluster sizes mapping to the sizes of disease outbreaks which start with a single disease carrier . using a combination of an exact generating function method with a high - order series expansion , we derive approximate analytic results for the position of the threshold and the mean outbreak and epidemic sizes as a function of the density of shortcuts in the 2d small - world network and the percolation probability , which is equivalent to disease transmission probability",
    ". as we demonstrate , our results are in excellent agreement with those from other studies using different methods , as well as with our own numerical simulations .",
    "we study the two - dimensional small - world model built on the square lattice . the model is depicted in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "we develop our generating function formalism for the general case of a @xmath1-dimensional square / cubic / hypercubic underlying lattice first , narrowing our scope to the two - dimensional case in section  [ series ] where we describe our series expansion calculations . for a @xmath1-dimensional lattice with bonds along the principal axes out to distance  @xmath2  @xcite , the underlying lattice has @xmath3 bonds on it , where @xmath4 is the system dimension , and shortcuts are added with probability @xmath0 per underlying bond , for a total of @xmath5 shortcuts",
    ". then all bonds , including the shortcut bonds , are occupied with probability @xmath6 , or not with probability @xmath7 , and we construct the percolation clusters of sites connected by the occupied bonds .",
    "the generating function part of our calculation follows the method of moore and newman  @xcite .",
    "we define a probability generating function @xmath8 thus : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the probability that a randomly chosen site in our small - world network belongs to a connected cluster of @xmath11 sites other than the system - spanning cluster .",
    "note that if the probability distribution @xmath10 is properly normalized , then @xmath12 below the transition and @xmath13 above the transition where @xmath14 is the fraction of the system occupied by the system - spanning cluster",
    ".    we also define @xmath15 to be the probability that a randomly chosen site belongs to a cluster of @xmath11 sites on the underlying lattice .",
    "the complete cluster on the small - world network is composed of a set of such underlying clusters , joined together by occupied shortcut bonds .",
    "if we denote by @xmath16 the probability that an underlying cluster of @xmath11 sites has exactly @xmath17 shortcuts emanating from it , then the generating function @xmath8 can be written self - consistently as  @xcite @xmath18^m . \\label{hz2}\\ ] ] ( the derivation of this equation assumes that all clusters other than the percolating cluster , if there is one , contain no closed loops other than those on the underlying lattice , i.e. ,  there are no loops involving shortcut bonds .",
    "this is only strictly true in the limit of infinite system size , and hence our results will only be exact in this limit . )",
    "there are a total of @xmath19 ends of occupied shortcuts in the model , and since all ends are uniformly distributed over the lattice the probability that any end lands in a given cluster of size @xmath11 is just @xmath20 for large @xmath4 .",
    "thus @xmath16 is given by the binomial distribution @xmath21^m           \\biggl[1-{n\\over l^d}\\biggr]^{2dl^dk\\phi p - m}.\\ ] ] substituting into eq .   and",
    "performing the sum over @xmath17 , this gives @xmath22^{2dl^dk\\phi p}\\nonumber\\\\       & = & \\sum_n p_0(n ) \\bigl[z",
    "\\e^{2dk\\phi p(h(z)-1)}\\bigr]^n , \\label{hz3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality holds in the limit of large  @xmath4 .",
    "if we define the additional generating function @xmath23 which is the probability generating function for the sizes of clusters for ordinary bond percolation on the underlying lattice , then eq .   can be written in the form @xmath24 this gives a self - consistency condition from which we can evaluate @xmath8 , and hence we can evaluate the probabilities @xmath10 for cluster sizes in the small - world model .    in fact , it is rarely possible to solve eq .   for @xmath8 in closed form ( although evaluation by numerical iteration is often feasible ) , but we can derive closed - form expressions for other quantities of interest . in particular , the average size of the cluster to which a randomly chosen site belongs is given by @xmath25,\\ ] ] or , rearranging , @xmath26 this quantity diverges when @xmath27 or equivalently when @xmath28 and this point marks the phase transition at which a giant cluster scaling as the size of the entire system first forms .",
    "another way of looking at this result is to note that @xmath29 , the average cluster size on the underlying lattice .",
    "thus percolation takes place when @xmath30 the quantity on the left - hand side of this equation is the average density of the ends of occupied shortcut bonds on the lattice ( see section  [ scaling ] ) , and thus percolation takes place when there is exactly one end of an occupied shortcut bond per cluster on the underlying lattice .",
    "this is reminiscent of the phase transition in an erds  rnyi random graph , which occurs at the point where each vertex in the graph is attached to exactly one edge  @xcite .",
    "above the phase transition @xmath31 is the size of the giant cluster . setting @xmath32 in eq .",
    "we find that @xmath14 is a solution of @xmath33 which can be solved by numerical iteration starting from a suitable initial value of  @xmath14 .",
    "an expression similar to   for the average size of non - percolating clusters above the transition can also be derived .",
    "see , for example , ref .  .",
    "in the one - dimensional case studied in ref .  , the calculation of the generating function @xmath34 is trivial ",
    "it is equivalent to solving the problem of bond percolation in one dimension . in the present case",
    "however we are interested primarily in the two - dimensional small - world model , and calculating @xmath35 is much harder ; no exact solution has ever been given for the distribution of cluster sizes for bond percolation on the square lattice . instead , therefore , we turn to series expansion to calculate @xmath35 approximately .",
    "@xmath34 for the two - dimensional case can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of different possible clusters on a square lattice which have @xmath38 occupied bonds , @xmath39 unoccupied bonds around their perimeter , and @xmath11 sites .",
    "if we can calculate @xmath37 up to some finite order then we can calculate an approximation to @xmath34 also .",
    "unfortunately , because @xmath37 depends separately on three different indices , it is prohibitively memory - intensive to calculate on a computer up to high order .",
    "we note however that we only need @xmath35 as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath40 , and not of @xmath7 separately , so we can collect terms in @xmath6 and rewrite the generating function as @xmath41 where the quantities @xmath42 are finite polynomials in @xmath40 which are , it s not hard to show , of order @xmath43 .",
    "calculating these polynomials is considerably more economical than calculating the entire set of @xmath37 . we have calculated them up to order @xmath44 using the finite - lattice method  @xcite , in which a generating function for the infinite lattice is built up by combining generating functions for the same problem on finite lattices .",
    "the finite lattices used in this case were rectangles of @xmath45 sites and the quantity we consider is the fundamental generating function for the cluster density @xmath46 which , it can be shown , is given by the linear combination @xmath47 where @xmath48 are constant weights that are independent of both @xmath40 and @xmath6 , and @xmath49 is the generating function for connected clusters ( bond animals ) which span an @xmath45 rectangle both from left to right and from top to bottom .",
    "due to the symmetry of the square lattice , the weight factor @xmath48 is simply @xmath50 the individual generating functions @xmath49 for the finite lattices are calculated using a transfer matrix method with generating functions for all rectangles of a given height @xmath51 being evaluated in a single calculation .",
    "the algorithm we use is based on that of conway  @xcite with enhancements similar to those used by jensen  @xcite for the enumeration of site animals on the square lattice  @xcite . since clusters spanning",
    "a rectangle of @xmath45 sites contain at least @xmath52 bonds , we must calculate @xmath49 for all @xmath53 and @xmath54 in order to derive a series expansion for @xmath55 correct to order @xmath17 in  @xmath6 . for the order @xmath44 calculation described here",
    "the maximal value of @xmath51 required was  @xmath56 .    [ cols=\">,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     since @xmath57 is the average size @xmath58 of a cluster in ordinary bond percolation on the square lattice , we know that it must diverge at @xmath59 , and that it does so as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the mean cluster - size exponent for two - dimensional percolation which is equal to @xmath62 . with this information",
    "we can construct a pad approximant to @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "writing @xmath63^{-\\gamma } , \\label{pade1}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is assumed analytic near @xmath65 , we construct a pad approximant to the series for @xmath66^\\gamma h_0'(1 ) , \\label{pade2}\\ ] ] using our series for @xmath57 .",
    "then we use this approximant in eq .   to give an expression for @xmath57 which agrees with our series expansion result to all available orders , and has a divergence of the expected kind at @xmath67 .",
    "as is typically the case with pad approximants , the best approximations are achieved with the highest order symmetric or near - symmetric approximants and using all available orders in our series expansion , we find the best results using a @xmath68 $ ] approximant to @xmath64 in eq .  .",
    "[ avsfig ] we show the resulting estimate for @xmath69 ( dotted line ) as a function of @xmath6 against numerical results for the average cluster size on an ordinary square lattice ( squares ) . as the figure shows , the agreement is excellent .    substituting our pad approximant expression for @xmath57 into eq .",
    "we can now calculate average cluster size for the small - world model for any value of @xmath0 , and from eq .",
    "we can calculate the position of the phase transition .",
    "[ avsfig ] we show the results for @xmath70 as a function of @xmath6 along with numerical results for the same quantity from simulations of the model . in fig .",
    "[ pc ] we show the results for @xmath65 plotted against numerical calculations  @xcite . in both cases , the agreement between analytic and numerical results is excellent . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ pc ] we show the results for @xmath65 on logarithmic scales , along with the value calculated by using the series expansion for @xmath57 directly in eq .",
    "( dotted line ) . as the figure shows , the pad approximate continues to be accurate to very low values of @xmath0 , where the direct series expansion fails .",
    "as ozana  @xcite has pointed out , there are two competing length - scales present in percolation models on small - world networks .",
    "one is the characteristic length @xmath71 of the small - world model itself which is given by @xmath72 , where @xmath1 is the dimension of the underlying lattice ( 2  in the present case ) .",
    "this length is the typical linear dimension of the volume on the underlying lattice which contains the end of one shortcut on average . in other words",
    "@xmath73 is the density of the ends of shortcuts on the lattice .",
    "( in fact , one normally leaves the factor of 2 out of the definition of the characteristic length , but we include it since it makes the resulting formulas somewhat neater in our case . ) in the current percolation model , only a fraction @xmath6 of the shortcuts are occupied and thereby contribute to the behavior of the model  the unoccupied shortcuts can be ignored .",
    "thus the appropriate characteristic length in our case is derived from the density of ends of occupied shortcuts , which was discussed in section  [ gf ] . the correct expression is @xmath74    the other length scale is the correlation length or typical cluster dimension for the percolation clusters on the underlying lattice .",
    "normally the latter is also denoted @xmath71 , but to avoid confusion we follow the notation of ref .   and here denote it  @xmath75 .",
    "ozana has given a finite - size scaling theory for percolation on small - world networks which addresses the interaction of each of these length - scales with the lattice dimension  @xmath4 .",
    "our analytic calculations however treat the case of @xmath76 , for which a simpler scaling theory applies . in this case , the only dimensionless combination of lengths is the ratio @xmath77 , and any observable quantity @xmath78 must satisfy a scaling relation of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are scaling exponents and @xmath82 is a universal scaling function .",
    "this form applies when we are in the region where both @xmath71 and @xmath75 are much greater than the lattice constant , i.e. ,  when shortcut density is low ( the scaling region of the small - world model ) and when we are close to the percolation transition on the normal square lattice .",
    "we can rewrite eq .   in a simpler form by making use of eq .   and",
    "the fact that the typical cluster dimension @xmath75 on the underlying lattice is related to typical cluster volume by @xmath83 ( assuming compact clusters ) .",
    "this then implies that @xmath84 where @xmath85 is another universal scaling function .",
    "consider for example the average cluster size @xmath70 for the small - world model . since we know",
    "this becomes equal to its normal square - lattice value @xmath58 when @xmath86 , we can immediately assume @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 thus , a plot of @xmath90 against the scaling variable @xmath91 should yield a data collapse whose form follows the scaling function  @xmath85 .",
    "in fact there is no need to make a scaling plot in this simple case .",
    "comparison of eq .   with eq .",
    ", bearing in mind that @xmath69 , reveals that @xmath70 does indeed follow the expected scaling form with @xmath92 the point @xmath93 , which is also the point at which the two length - scales are equal @xmath94 , thus represents the percolation transition in this case .",
    "( this observation is equivalent to eq .  . )",
    "a slightly less trivial example of the scaling form   is the scaling of the size @xmath14 of the giant percolation cluster , eq .  .",
    "to deduce the leading terms in the scaling relation for  @xmath14 , we expand   close to the percolation transition in powers of  @xmath14 , to give @xmath95\\over2[h_0'(1)]^2}\\ , x^2 s^2 + \\o(s^3).\\ ] ] rearranging and keeping terms to leading order , we find @xmath96 ^ 2\\over[h_0'(1)+h_0''(1 ) ] } \\left[{x-1\\over x^2}\\right ]    = 2 { \\av{n_0}^2\\over\\av{n^2_0 } } \\left[{x-1\\over x^2}\\right].\\ ] ] if there is only one correlation length for percolation on the underlying lattice then @xmath97 is homogeneous in it and hence constant in the critical region .",
    "thus @xmath14 scales as @xmath98 close to the transition , with the leading constant being zero below the transition and @xmath99 above it .",
    "we have presented analytic results for bond percolation in the two - dimensional small - world network model , which has been proposed as a simple model of the spread of plant diseases . using a combination of generating function methods and series expansion ,",
    "we have derived approximate but highly accurate expressions for quantities such as the position of the percolation transition in the model , the typical size of non - percolating clusters , and the typical size of the percolating cluster .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of the model . by judicious use of pad approximants for the series expansions",
    ", the results can even be extended to very low shortcut densities , where a simple series expansion fails .",
    "the results are also in good agreement with the expected scaling forms for the model .",
