    "in the last few decades many efforts have been employed in order to understand models that present lorentz- and cpt - symmetry breaking , see for instance @xcite",
    ". in particular , the main contributions are interested in how these models are situated under aspects of the usual quantum field theory . due to the well known success of quantum field theory  specially , gauge field theory  in describing at least three of four fundamental interactions , any extension of the standard model respecting attributes as stability , renormalizability , unitarity and causality could be interesting .",
    "in fact , the lorentz and gauge symmetry have a fundamental importance on the features mentioned before .",
    "for instance , the functional that describes the dynamics of the fields belonging to the standard model are built in a lorentz covariant way and the classification of particles is performed by studying the lorentz group representations @xcite . moreover , besides restricting the coupling between fields , the gauge symmetry play an important role on unitarity and renormalizability of gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the abelian lorentz- and cpt - violating minimal standard model extension ( msme ) , _",
    "i.e_. , lorentz- and cpt - violating qed , is characterized by the presence of constant background tensorial ( and pseudo - tensorial ) fields coupled to the fundamental fields of the theory , and is power - counting renormalizable @xcite .",
    "these background fields are , in principle , natural consequences of more fundamental theories such as string theories @xcite , non - commutative field theories @xcite , supersymmetric field theories @xcite and loop quantum gravity @xcite . for instance",
    ", there exists the possibility of spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking in string theory .",
    "this breaking manifests itself when tensorial fields acquire non - trivial vacuum expectation values .",
    "this feature implies on a preferred spacetime direction .",
    "although many searches have been performed in order to detect signs of these background tensors @xcite , nothing have been found so far .",
    "nevertheless , these efforts have been useful to determine phenomenological and experimental upper bounds for the v.e.v . of these tensors @xcite .    in what concerns the theoretical consistency of these models ,",
    "it has been verified that they can preserve causality and unitary @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we confine ourselves to the formal analysis of renormalizability of the lorentz- and cpt - violating qed .",
    "in fact , there are some works about the renormalizability of such models . for instance : in @xcite , the one - loop renormalization is discussed ; the proof of renormalizability to all orders in perturbation theory , from algebraic renormalization technique point of view @xcite , was performed in @xcite .",
    "the latter makes use of the gauge symmetry and requires pt - invariance to prove that anomalies are not present . essentially , they prove the renormalizability of the model with c and/or pt - invariance .",
    "moreover , they find nine independent renormalization parameters ; furthermore , they also show in @xcite that no cpt - odd bosonic lorentz violation is generated from the cpt - odd fermionic lorentz violation sector ; there also exist studies about the renormalization properties of the qed extension on curved manifolds @xcite . in this work",
    "the renormalization study was realized by assuming that lorentz- and cpt - violating parameters are classical fields rather than constants .",
    "this last approach shares some resemblance with the present work .",
    "it is worth mention that there also exists a class of lorentz - violating quantum field theories which can also preserve unitarity and renormalizability , see for instance @xcite .",
    "these theories are characterized by the presence of higher order space derivatives while the time derivatives remain at the same order of the usual fermionic or bosonic models .",
    "the renormalizability is assured by modifying the usual power counting criterion by introducing the concept of  weighted power - counting \" @xcite .",
    "actually , they introduce a regulator to account for this discrepancy .",
    "this criterion can put on a renormalizable form vertexes that , in principle , are non renormalizable @xcite .",
    "for instance , a higher - energy lorentz - violating qed shows itself to be super - renormalizable and its low - energy limit is recovered by choosing specific values for scale parameters @xcite . in this work , however , we deal with carroll - field - jackiw theories @xcite , which constitute a whole different class of theories .",
    "for instance , space and time are treated on an equal footing , and the lorentz violation manifests itself under particle lorentz transformations . on the other hand ,",
    "these theories are manifestly invariant under observer lorentz transformations .    in this work ,",
    "we employ the brst quantization and algebraic renormalization theory to explore the renormalizability of lorentz- and cpt - violating qed .",
    "in particular , we generalize the study made in @xcite for all possible lorentz breaking terms .",
    "furthermore , in this work we add one more breaking term not considered in @xcite , which is a massive term coupled to a pseudo - scalar operator .",
    "the main idea can be summarized in the following way : the action which describes the bosonic lorentz violation of cpt - odd is gauge invariant only because the lorentz - violating coefficients are constant ( and also neglecting surface terms ) .",
    "thus , the gauge symmetry is ensured at the action level , but not at lagrangian level .",
    "the algebraic renormalization approach , which will be used here , relies on the quantum action principle ( qap ) @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to analyze the renormalizability of the lorentz - violating qed we will employ here the symanzik method @xcite  vastly employed in non - abelian gauge theories in order to control a soft brst symmetry breaking , see @xcite  to treat the brst quantization of the lorentz - violating electrodynamics .",
    "we will follow here the procedure employed in the proof of the renormalizability to all orders in perturbation theory of pure yang - mills ( ym ) theory with lorentz violation @xcite .",
    "the main results obtained from our approach are : first , the model is renormalizable to all orders in perturbation theory ; second , the usual qed sector has only three independent renormalization parameters ( in accordance with the usual qed ) ; third , the chern - simons - like violating term does not renormalize .",
    "moreover , we attain extra important results : the lorentz - violating sector has nineteen renormalization parameters ; extra independent renormalization parameters are needed to account for extra vacuum divergences that do not appear from other approaches .",
    "however , these terms do not affect the dynamical content of the model ; as pointed out in @xcite , the abelian chern - simons - like term is not induced from the cpt - odd lorentz - violating term of the fermionic sector , see also @xcite ; although one - loop computations have already been done in @xcite , we also perform these computations here in order to compare them with the algebraic results .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ qed ] we provide the definitions , conventions and some properties of the lorentz - violating electrodynamics . in sect .",
    "[ quatization ] , the brst quantization of the model with the extra set of auxiliary sources is provided : where we discuss the subtle quantization of the lorentz - violating coefficients coupled with this respective composite operators within of this formalism . in sect .",
    "[ renormalizability ] , we study the renormalizability properties of the model , with a detailed study of the quantum stability of the model . then , in sect .",
    "[ oneloop ] , we present the one - loop explicit computations and its relation with our renormalization independent scheme is discussed .",
    "our final considerations are displayed in sect .",
    "[ final ] .",
    "the qed extension , just like the standard qed , is a gauge theory for the @xmath0 group , where the electromagnetic field is coupled to the dirac field through minimal coupling .",
    "however , this theory presents lorentz violation in both , bosonic and fermionic , sectors .",
    "the breaking sectors are characterized by the presence of background fields .",
    "the model is described by following action @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the classical action of the usual qed .",
    "the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath3 , the field strength is written as @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the gauge potential . the parameter @xmath6 stands for the electron mass and @xmath7 for its electric charge .",
    "the @xmath8 matrices are in dirac representation ( see @xcite for the full set of conventions\\;. \\label{def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ] ) .",
    "the other term in is the lorentz - violating sector , @xmath9 where , @xmath10 the violation of lorentz symmetry in the fermionic sector is characterized by the following constant tensorial fields : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these tensors select privileged directions in spacetime , dooming it to anisotropy .",

    "the tensorial fields @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are dimensionless and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 has mass dimension 1 .",
    "the tensor field @xmath19 is anti - symmetric and @xmath15 is anti - symmetric only on its first two indexes . at the photonic sector",
    ", the lorentz violation is characterized by the field @xmath20 , with mass dimension 1 , and @xmath21 , which is dimensionless .",
    "the tensor @xmath21 obeys the same properties of the riemann tensor , and is double traceless @xmath22 as the reader can easily infer , the action is a lorentz scalar , being invariant under observers lorentz transformations while , in contrast , presents violation with respect to particle lorentz transformations and @xmath23 be a generic field and a background vector field , respectively . under observer lorentz transformation , _ i.e. _ , exchange of references systems , these fields behave as @xmath24 and @xmath25 . on the other hand , under particle lorentz transformation",
    "the reference systems do not transform , but the fields transform as @xmath24 and @xmath26 . the generalization to ( pseudo-)tensorial backgrounds are immediate . ] @xcite .",
    "in the process of quantization of the qed extension theory , as in the usual qed , gauge fixing is required . in the present work",
    "we employ the brst quantization method and adopt , for simplicity , the landau gauge condition @xmath27 .",
    "thus , besides the photon and electron fields , we introduce the lautrup - nakanishi field @xmath28 and the faddeev - popov ghost and anti - ghost fields .",
    "ii ) due to the discrete faddeev - popov symmetry , the trivial and non - trivial sectors of the brst cohomology becomes explicit ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "iii ) with the introduction of the @xmath28 field , it is easy to see that photon propagator keeps its transversality to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "iv ) as expected , the tree - level decoupling of the ghosts is kept at all orders in perturbation theory , see  sect .",
    "this feature will bring important consequences for the renormalization properties of the cpt - odd bosonic violating sector of the action .",

    "<S> in this work , we employ algebraic renormalization technique to show the renormalizability to all orders in perturbation theory of the lorentz- and cpt - violating qed . essentially , we control the breaking terms by using a suitable set of external sources . </S>",
    "<S> thus , with the symmetries restored , a perturbative treatment can be consistently employed . after showing the renormalizability , </S>",
    "<S> the external sources attain certain physical values , which allow the recovering of the starting physical action . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is that the original qed action presents the three usual independent renormalization parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz - violating sector can be renormalized by nineteen independent parameters . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , vacuum divergences appear with extra independent renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the bosonic odd sector ( chern - simons - like term ) does not renormalize and is not radiatively generated . </S>",
    "<S> one - loop computations are also presented and compared with the existing literature . </S>"
