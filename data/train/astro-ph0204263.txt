    "in january 2001 we observed for the first time ever with an x  ray telescope ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : xfirst ] , tab.[kdennerl - b1_tab : obscxo ] ) .",
    "orbiting the sun at heliocentric distances of 0.7180.728 astronomical units ( au ) , the angular separation of venus from the sun , as seen from earth , never exceeds 47.8 degrees ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : venus5 ] ) .",
    "while the observing window of imaging x  ray astronomy satellites is usually restricted to solar elongations of at least @xmath4 , chandra is the first such satellite which is able to observe as close as @xmath5 from the limb of the sun .",
    "thus , with chandra an observation of venus with an imaging x ",
    "ray astronomy satellite became possible for the first time .",
    "the observation was scheduled to take place around the time of greatest eastern elongation , when venus was @xmath6 away from the sun ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : venus5 ] ) . at that time it appeared optically as a very bright ( -4.4  mag ) , approximately half  illuminated crescent with a diameter of @xmath7 ( tab.[kdennerl - b1_tab : obsgeo ] , figs.[kdennerl - b1_fig : v7gg],[kdennerl - b1_fig : simsum]e ) .",
    "this observation led to the discovery of x ",
    "rays from venus .",
    "it provided not only the first x  ray image of this earth  like planet ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : xfirst ] ) , but also spectra and lightcurves , which together give a consistent picture about the origin of the x ",
    "the main scientific results will appear in @xcite .",
    "here we summarize them and present additional information .",
    "venus is the celestial object with the highest optical surface brightness after the sun and a highly challenging target for an x  ray observation with chandra , as the x  ray detectors there ( ccds and microchannel plates ) are also sensitive to optical light .",
    "suppression of optical light is achieved by optical blocking filters which , however , must not attenuate the x ",
    "rays significantly .",
    "the observation was originally planned to use the back  illuminated acis ",
    "s3 ccd , which has the highest sensitivity to soft ( e@xmath81.4  kev ) x ",
    "rays , for direct imaging of venus , utilizing the intrinsic energy resolution for obtaining spectral information . before the observation was scheduled , however , it turned out that the optical filter on this ccd would not be sufficient for blocking the extremely high optical flux from venus .",
    "therefore , half of the observation ( obsid 583 , cf.tab.[kdennerl-b1_tab:obscxo ] ) was performed with the front  illuminated ccds of the acis ",
    "i array ( i1 and i3 ) , which are less sensitive to soft x ",
    "rays , but which are also significantly less affected by optical light contamination .    in order to avoid any ambiguity in the x  ray signal due to residual optical light",
    ", we utilized the low energy transmission grating ( letg ) for the other half of the observation ( obsid 2411 and 2414 , cf.tab.[kdennerl-b1_tab:obscxo ] ) .",
    "the letg played an an essential role for the venus observation .",
    "not only did it allow us to obtain a high resolution x - ray spectrum , but it provided also an efficient way of diffracting the extremely intense optical light to areas outside the ccds , so that optical photons would not interfere with the x - ray observation .",
    "with this technique we could undoubtedly prove that x - rays were detected from venus , despite the fact that the x - ray intensity turned out not to exceed one ten - billionth of the optical intensity .",
    "the combination of direct imaging and spectroscopy with the letg made it possible to obtain complementary spatial and spectral information within the available total observing time of 6.5 hours .",

    "there was no need for continuous tracking .",
    "the spacecraft was oriented such that venus would move parallel to one side of the ccds and perpendicular to the dispersion direction in the letg observation . to keep venus well inside the @xmath20 field of view ( fov ) of acis ",
    "s perpendicular to the dispersion direction , chandra was repointed at the middle of the letg / acis  s observation ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : acis - s ] , tab.[kdennerl - b1_tab : obscxo ] ) . for acis ",
    "i with its larger @xmath21 fov , no repointing during the observation was necessary ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : acis - i ] , tab.[kdennerl - b1_tab : obscxo ] ) . as the photons were recorded time",
    " tagged , an individual post ",
    "facto transformation into the rest frame of venus was possible .",
    "this is illustrated in figs.[kdennerl - b1_fig : acis_i_trail_g ] and [ kdennerl - b1_fig : v00 ] .",
    "the fact that all observations were performed with ccds with intrinsic energy resolution made it possible to suppress the background with high efficiency ( cf.fig.[kdennerl-b1_fig:v00]@xmath22[kdennerl-b1_fig:v583gr_ ] and fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : letg_sum ] , b@xmath23c ) .",
    "the acis  i data clearly show that the x  ray spectrum of venus is very soft : at energies @xmath24 no enhancement is seen at the position of venus , neither in the image ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : v583gr _ ] ) nor in the surface brightness profile ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : vn4spa_v2 ] ) .",
    "we determine a @xmath25 upper limit of @xmath26 to any flux from venus in the 1.52.0  kev energy range . the corresponding value for @xmath278  kev is @xmath28 . further spectral analysis of the acis ",
    "i data is complicated by the presence of optical loading ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : vn4spa_v2 ] ) .",
    "the letg spectrum , however , which is completely uncontaminated by optical light , clearly shows that most of the observed flux comes from o  k@xmath0 fluorescence ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : letg_sum ] ) . as this flux is monochromatic ,",
    "images of the venus crescent ( illuminated from bottom ) show up along the dispersion direction .",
    "in addition to the o  k@xmath0 emission , we detect also fluorescence emission from c  k@xmath0 and , marginally , from n  k@xmath0 .",
    "k@xmath0 image appears elongated , and spectral fits indicate the presence of an additional emission line at 0.29  kev , which might be the signature of the c @xmath1 transition in co@xmath2 and co.    compared to its optical flux @xmath29 , the total x  ray flux @xmath30 from venus is extremely low : @xmath31 .",
    "taking into account that the energy of a k@xmath32 photon exceeds that of an optical photon by two orders of magnitude , we find that on average there is only one x ",
    "ray photon among @xmath33 photons from venus .",
    "this extremely small fraction of x  ray versus optical flux , combined with the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum and the proximity of venus to the sun , illustrates the challenge of observing venus in x",
    "the x  ray flux is emitted in just three narrow emission lines . outside these lines",
    "the @xmath34 ratio is even orders of magnitude lower .        in the x  ray image ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : v00 ] ) the crescent of venus",
    "is clearly resolved and allows detailed comparisons with the optical appearance . an optical image ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : simsum]e ) , taken at the same phase angle , shows a sphere which is slightly more than half illuminated , closely resembling the geometric illumination ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : v7gg ] ) , with the brightness maximum well inside the crescent . in the x ",
    "ray image the sphere appears to be less than half illuminated .",
    "the most striking difference , however , is the pronounced limb brightening , which is particularly obvious in the surface brightness profiles ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : vn4spa_v2 ] ) and in the smoothed x  ray image ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : simsum]d ) .    for a quantitative understanding of this brightening we performed a numerical simulation of the appearance of venus in soft x ",
    "rays , based on fluorescent scattering of solar x  ray radiation ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : vsim ] ) .",
    "the ingredients to this simulation were the composition and density structure of the venus atmosphere ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : atmo1]a ) , the photoabsorption cross sections ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : crsc ] ) and fluorescence efficiencies of the major atmospheric constituents , and the incident solar spectrum ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : incflx ] ) .",
    "the simulation showed that the volume emissivity peaks at heights of 120140  km and extends into the tenuous , optically thin parts of the thermosphere and exosphere ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : atmo1]b ) .",
    "we see the volume emissivities accumulated along the line of sight without considerable absorption ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : atmo2 ] ) , so that the observed brightness is mainly determined by the extent of the atmospheric column along the line of sight .",
    "this causes the pronounced brightening at the sunward limb , accompanied by reduced brightness at the terminator .",
    "limb brightening would also be observed at other phase angles ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : vnlum1sim_1 ] ) .",
    "the simulation shows that the amount of limb brightening is different for the three fluorescence energies ( fig.[kdennerl - b1_fig : simsum ] a  c ) and depends on the properties of the venus atmosphere at heights above 110  km .",
    "thus , information about the chemical composition and density structure of the venus thermosphere and exosphere can be obtained by measuring the x  ray brightness distribution across the planet in the individual k@xmath32 fluorescence lines .",
    "this opens the possibility of using x  ray observations for remotely monitoring the properties of these regions in the venus atmosphere which are difficult to investigate otherwise , and their response to solar activity .",
