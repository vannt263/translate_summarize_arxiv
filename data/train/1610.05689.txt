    "it is well established that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) exhibit extreme x - ray flux variability as they accrete matter onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) . such variability has been observed in timescales of minutes to hours , up to longer timescales .",
    "seyfert galaxies correspond to a subclass of agns , characterized in terms of total luminosity coming from their nuclei .",
    "the spectrum exhibit broad emission lines that cover a wide range in ionization @xcite , and depending on the characteristics and kinematics presented of such lines , are further subclassified into type 1 and type 2 , among more specific subclassifications defined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mass outflows , evidenced by blueshifted absorption lines of ionized gas coming from the central regions of seyfert galaxies , are believed to be closely related to agn spectral power .",
    "they play an important role in understanding the structure , dynamics and evolution of agns , and therefore are fundamental in order to investigate the extent of the contribution of outflows to agn feedback . although the origin of x - ray variability is still not fully understood , in a general way the spectral changes can be attributed either to time dependent structural changes in the absorption features or source variations , and sometimes it is very difficult to narrow down a single solution to model the observed spectrum .",
    "many different scenarios have been proposed to account for spectral variability in agns , and below we list a few of them :    1 .",
    "the x - ray source varies in luminosity , due to changes in the mass accretion rate , structural changes in the accretion disk , flaring events , etc , causing the intrinsic continuum flux to vary accordingly , and the absorption components to respond by changing their ionization state , hence their opacity to the incident radiation ; this scenario implies a certain stability in the nature of the x - ray absorbers , which has been previously discussed by @xcite in the study of ngc 3783 . 2 .",
    "the x - ray source remains roughly constant in luminosity or varies on a much longer timescale , and the observed variability appears when high column density clouds of intervening gas temporarily cover the source and shield the absorbers , causing their ionization state to vary , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "specific examples include mgc @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 ( @xcite ) , and also ngc 3516 ( @xcite ; in which their figure 1 illustrates the extreme variability in the absorption profile ) .",
    "major changes in the spectrum are not due to variations in the x - ray source , which may vary or remain constant , but to changes in column density of the absorbers due to transverse motion of gas , as proposed i.e. by kra2005 for the 2002 and 2000 _ chandra _ spectra on ngc 4151 , and more recently by @xcite for ngc 5548 . spectral variability could also be attributed to changes in the relative fractions of intrinsic and reflected continuum . as @xcite discuss in the study of ngc 4051 , such changes can be explained by effects of reverberation lags , caused by high covering factor reflecting material .",
    "all of the above scenarios make physical sense and have been probed with observational evidence in studies of different agns . the idea of single scenario to account for the x - ray variability still does not seem plausible , and conclusions must rely on the data available for each individual galaxy .    in this paper we will focus on investigating the long term flux variability and intrinsic absorption of ngc 4151 on a timescale of 14 years",
    "is one of the nearest ( z=0.0033 ; @xcite ) and brightest agn and is classified as a seyfert 1.5 , exhibiting comparable broad and narrow emission components in h@xmath1 @xcite . over the past decades ,",
    "ngc 4151 has been the target of many single and multiwavelength observations , and its heavily absorbed x - ray spectrum and complex intrinsic absorption features have been extensively studied . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", the complexity of the intrinsic absorption in ngc 4151 could be related with the 45@xmath2 viewing angle @xcite of the black hole / accretion disk system .",
    "the hard x - ray ( 2@xmath010 kev ) shows strong flux variability and the soft energy band ( @xmath3 2 kev ) is dominated by emission lines with velocity widths that would indicate that they are coming from the intermediate line region ( ilr ) , located at @xmath4 1 pc , up to the narrow line region ( nlr ) , that can extend from @xmath4  10  pc  to @xmath4  1 kpc @xcite .    as we will discuss in more detail in this paper ,",
    "our initial assumption is that the x - ray flux variability is related to the opacity of the gas , although kra2005 found no simple correlation between the ionization state and the intrinsic continuum flux , and pointed out that this result corroborates with the idea of transverse motion of gas across our line - of - sight .",
    "furthermore , our analysis will provide us with insights in the temporal evolution of the x - ray absorbers and the nature of the mass outflows in ngc 4151 .",
    "section 2 , we give a detailed description of the observations and data reduction ; section 3 , we discuss about the x - ray spectral variability and the x - ray model ; section 4 , we present our results and comparison between different epochs ; in section 5 we will discuss the implications of our analysis , and finally section 6 gives a summary and final conclusions .",

    "the reflected component has the same spectral shape as the incident continuum in terms of photon index and normalization parameters , and it is described in more detail in the following subsections . * _ dual absorption component_. the absorbers will be modeled in terms of changes in column density and/or ionization parameter , and as in the kra2005 model we assume that they are radially distributed around the central source .",
    "we can identify two main absorption components , with the nearest , more highly ionized one ( x - high ) , filtering the ionizing radiation incident on the less ionized component ( d+ea ) .",
    "defined by @xcite .",
    "this component is a combination of components d and e , identified by @xcite nomenclature for the ultraviolet ( uv ) kinematic components ; it can be detected both in the uv and x - ray spectrum . ]",
    "the absorbers lie in front of the source intrinsic and reflected continuum , and are seen as imprinted absorption features .",
    "we start with the assumption that the column densities of the absorbers are equal , and see if we can find a good statistical solution by varying ionization parameter , or if we need to adjust them . * _ emission lines_. the spectrum is dominated by emission lines in the soft x - ray band , below 2  kev , as illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "the emission lines are represented in the model as gaussians , and correspond to the extended emission of ngc 4151 .",
    "the lines were based on the soft x - ray emission of spectrum presented in @xcite , and are summarized on table 2 ( note that _ chandra _ hetg has a spectral resolution of @xmath34e  =  0.4@xmath077 ev fwhm and is capable of resolving fwhm down to @xmath4 300 km s@xmath16 ) .",

    "therefore , we included turbulence of 100 km  s@xmath16 ( see kra2005 ) , and the resulting fit in the energy range of the silicon inner shell lines is shown in figure 7 .      based on our refitting of the 2002 dataset , we proceeded with the 2014 _ chandra _ observations . in a lower flux state ,",
    "all model components play a much important role in shaping the spectrum we observe .",
    "the reflected continuum becomes more dominant , and many of features imprinted in the absorption continuum of high flux state epochs are only seen as emission lines in the low flux ones . without allowing xspec to fit the data , we got an acceptable solution , identical to the kra2005 fitting for the 2000 dataset , which suggested transverse motion manifested by a considerable increase in the column density of d+ea ( @xmath69  @xmath4  8  @xmath13  10@xmath71 @xmath72 ) .",
    "however , in allowing the parameters of d+ea to vary , the fitting favored an unphysical solution in which u@xmath75 increased , which seemed highly unlikely given its lower flux state .",
    "thus , following the fitting of the 2002 dataset we tied column densities of x - high and d+ea .",
    "it was evident in the fittings , though , that a bigger column was needed to properly model the low flux spectrum .",
    "we were able to reproduce the 2014 spectrum shape , and a final satisfactory statistical fit was achieved when we allowed a fraction of the intrinsic continuum to be seen without any attenuation , due , for example , to scattering by free electrons .",
    "such component is modeled as an uncovered powerlaw with photon index @xmath30  @xmath4  2.4 , contributing mostly to the soft energy range of the spectrum .",
    "our best model fitting for the 2014 data is illustrated in figure 8 .",
    "variations in the gas opacity are still a major contributor to the observed spectral changes between high and low states , but we also noticed an increase in the 2014 column density when compared with the 2002 model ( @xmath69  @xmath45  @xmath13  10@xmath71 @xmath72 ) .",
    "such values for column density imply in the saturation of predicted ionic column densities of low ionization ions such as c ii , si ii and o  i ( see table 3 ) .",
    "the uncovered scattering is evidenced in the lower flux state , where it contributes more significantly to the total flux . however , by refitting the 2002 data to include the scattering component , we obtain an improvement of 0.1 in @xmath76@xmath77 in the 0.5@xmath08.0 kev range .",
    "figure 7 also shows a a comparison between the 2002 and 2014 intrinsic absorption in the 1.7  @xmath0  2.1 kev band .",
    "some of the emission lines coming from the extended emission region are also highlighted in the plot .",
    "the low signal - to - noise , due to the drop in flux , combined with the emission lines , makes it impossible to detect individual absorption features .",
    "furthermore , in order to test the consistency of our model with the observed uv spectrum , we extrapolated our absorption corrected x - ray model to the uv region and calculated the predicted model flux at 1350 @xmath78 using our broken powerlaw parameters .",
    "we used the x - ray flux at 5 kev , f@xmath79  =  1.05  @xmath13  10@xmath80  photons @xmath72 s@xmath16 kev@xmath16 , and estimated the intrinsic continuum flux without absorption at 0.5 kev .",
    "thus we calculated the uv flux to be f@xmath81  =  @xmath4  3.3  @xmath13  10@xmath82 erg @xmath72 s@xmath16 @xmath83 , which overpredicts the observed flux by @xmath4  30  @xmath21 , but it is still consistent if we consider that we did not correct the x - ray intrinsic continuum flux at 5 kev to contributions from the reflected continuum .",

    "based on our results in table 4 and a rough qualitative spectral fit , the 2006 observation is parameterized as n@xmath22  @xmath4  5  @xmath13  10@xmath71 @xmath72 , @xmath73  u@xmath74  @xmath4  0.5 and @xmath73  u@xmath75  @xmath4  @xmath0  0.7 , which is consistent with a 2@xmath010 kev flux of @xmath4  8  @xmath13  10@xmath134 erg @xmath72 s@xmath16 .",

    "point out , mhd models are consistent with @xmath26  @xmath4  1 up to 1.25 , and therefore our results suggest that d+ea is not part of the same mhd flow as the ufo . on the other hand , there is a very likely possibility that x - high is part of an mhd outflow .",
    "if that was the case , by considering u  @xmath129  1/(@xmath128r@xmath77 ) and assuming @xmath26  =  1 , we can calculate the location of x - high based on the ionization parameter and location of the ufo .",

    "moreover , such location for x - high is also consistent with the location of the non - ufo absorbers ( see @xcite ) , which provides additional support to the fact that they may correspond to the same absorption component .",
    "this could indicate that at a sufficiently large radial distance , i.e. between x - high and d+ea , there should be a break point between mhd - dominated and radiatively driven outflows .",
    "finally , the model results for the majority of the observations show a uniform column density within the absorbers .",
    "the intrinsic absorption respond to flux variations in terms of changes in its ionization state , but we also observe column density variations between high and low flux states .",
    "it is important to stress how well constrained are the column density variations , and how remarkably identical is the spectral shape of the 2000 and 2014 low flux _",
    "_ datasets .",
    "previous studies have discussed variabilities in the column density of d+ea , such as the kra2005 model , but changes in x - high makes us believe that there should be a fundamental and more universal explanation for the observed variations .",
    "we can think of many physically possible scenarios that could account for the column density variations , and the most straightforward answer is that simply there is more material in our line of sight .",
    "a decrease in the incident radiation in lower flux epochs could cause the gas not to be as efficiently driven as in higher flux ones .",
    "another possible explanation is that variations in the ionizing radiation coming from the source induce changes in the gas condensation / evaporation ratios , affecting the gas stability and consequently making more material to condense from higher ionization states , as @xcite described in the multi - temperature wind models .",
    "although it would be very difficult to quantitatively rule out these scenarios , they still rely on the coincidence that high and low flux epochs at some point return to nearly identical states .    with that in mind",
    "we suggest a third possibility , in terms of changes in the x - ray corona .",
    "in such scenario , we are looking through an unresolved column density distribution of gas , inversely proportional to its radial distance from the central agn , such that the column density is higher closest to the source .",
    "the observed x - ray flux variabilities would then be due to a change in the average column density covering the source as the x - ray corona becomes less extended in lower flux states .",
    "this implies that the x - ray corona expands as the luminosity increases , and contracts closer to the black hole as the flux decreases again .",
    "what we obtain is an average column density , since we can not deconvolve the column density distribution of the absorbers .",
    "figure 11 shows an schematic representation of the model s geometry for ngc 4151 .",
    "furthermore , changes in the x - ray corona have been previously suggested by @xcite in the study of the flux variability of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h 0707@xmath0495 .",
    "given that the uv continuum and emission lines come from a more extended region than the x - ray corona , we would likely not observe this effect in the uv .",
    "in this paper we revisit the analysis of the complex hard x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 in order to address some still open , and yet fundamental questions about agns .",

    "suzaku_. over the past 14 years , we observed significant variability in the 2@xmath010 kev flux of .",
    "the intrinsic continuum is more heavily absorbed in the lower flux state than in the higher flux state epochs , but overall they present a very similar spectral shape . our most notable results and concluding remarks are listed below :    \\1 . the observations can be clearly divided into high and low states .",
    "each group shows very distinct spectral characteristics , and the low states exhibit strong extended , unabsorbed emission at energies below 2 kev .",
    "the 2014 _ chandra _ and _ stis _ observations were found in a very low flux state .",
    "our model results imply that the absorbers are very stable .",
    "changes in the continuum are mostly intrinsic , meaning that the source is varying in brightness , rather than the flux is dropping due to the passage of optically thick gas into our line - of - sight .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the uv spectrum also showed significant flux variations , which ruled out the possibility of occultations .",
    "furthermore , the remarkable similarities in the spectral shape of the 2014 and 2000 _ chandra _ also suggest intrinsic variation .",
    "\\3 . additionally to the intrinsic continuum changes ,",
    "the low flux state epochs show evidence of larger column densities in one or both of the absorbers . among the possible explanations explored in detail in the previous section",
    ", we suggest that such variations in column density can be attributed to changes in x - ray coronal size .",
    "specifically , the x - ray corona expands as the luminosity increases , and contracts as the flux decreases .",
    "as suggested by kra2005 , mhd winds seem to play an important role in the mass outflows in ngc 4151 , as x - high is consistent with being magnetically driven , along with the ufo absorber identified by on the 2006 _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "concurrently , d+ea model parameters indicate that it can not be part of the mhd flow , and it is likely accelerated through radiative processes .",
    "these results suggest that at a sufficiently large radial distance there should be a break point between mhd - dominated and radiatively driven outflows , which might help us understand the origin of the outflows and ultimately their role in agn feedback .",

    "<S> our x - ray model consists of a broken powerlaw , neutral reflection and the two dominant absorption components identified by @xcite , hereafter kra2005 , x - high and d+ea , which are present in all epochs . </S>",
    "<S> the model fittings suggest that the absorbers are very stable , with the principal changes in the intrinsic absorption resulting from variations in the ionization state of the gas as the ionizing continuum varies . </S>",
    "<S> however , the low states show evidence of larger column densities in one or both of the absorbers . among plausible explanations for the column increase </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the possibility of an expanding / contracting x - ray corona . as suggested by kra2005 , there seem to be contributions from magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) winds to the mass outflow . along with the ultra fast outflow absorber identified by , </S>",
    "<S> x - high is consistent with being magnetically driven . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is unlikely that d+ea is part of the mhd flow , and it is possible that it is radiatively accelerated . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that at a sufficiently large radial distance there is a break point between mhd - dominated and radiatively driven outflows . </S>"
