    "recently , the b - factories at slac , kek and cesr , which were originally constructed to test matter - antimatter asymmetries or cp violation , have discovered new hidden - charm states around the energy region of @xmath2 mev .",
    "these new states do not seem to have a simple @xmath8 structure .",
    "they are naively called as xyz particles",
    ". some of them , which we consider in this manuscript , are the x(3940 ) , the y(3940 ) , the x(4160 ) and the z(3930 ) .",
    "the x(3940 ) and the x(4160 ) were observed by the belle collaboration in the @xmath9 reaction as a @xmath10 and @xmath6 mass peak respectively @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 has been observed but there is no signal for the @xmath12 or the @xmath13 decays . because the fact that the @xmath14 and @xmath15 were also produced in double - charm production , it was believed that the x(3940 ) could have @xmath16 , being a @xmath17 charmonium state ( @xmath18 ) , but then the x(3940 ) should have a mass @xmath19 @xmath20 mev or even higher @xcite . concerning to the x(4160 ) , the known charmonium states seen from a @xmath21 reaction have @xmath22 , thus , if this state is identified with a @xmath23 ( @xmath18 ) or @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) charmonium state , the mass predicted in the first case will be smaller ( @xmath20 mev ) and higher ( @xmath26 mev ) in the second case @xcite . on the other hand , the y(3940 )",
    "has been firstly observed by the belle collaboration and babar has confirmed it in @xmath27 decays @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the values for the mass and width reported by babar are smaller than the belle s values .",
    "also , very recently , belle has reported a narrow peak in the cross section for @xmath28 @xcite that is consistent with the mass and width reported for the y(3940 ) by the babar group .",
    "this peak , dubbed as x(3915 ) , has a mass @xmath29 mev and width @xmath30 mev .",
    "the measure of the mass favor the possible assignment of this new peak to the y(3940 ) instead of the z(3930 ) .",
    "the production modes ensure that the x(4160 ) as well as the x(3940 ) and y(3940 ) have c - parity positive .",
    "recently , the cdf collaboration at fermilab has announced a narrow peak near the @xmath31 threshold , which is designated as y(4140 ) , observed in the @xmath32 decay , it has a mass @xmath33 mev and a width @xmath34 mev @xcite .",
    "the width observed is quite different from the one reported by belle for the x(4160 ) @xcite , suggesting that one is taking about a different state .",
    "finally , the z(3930 ) has been seen by belle as a peak in the spectrum of @xmath12 mesons produced in @xmath35 collisions .",
    "the belle measurements favors the @xmath5 hypothesis , making the assignment of the z(3930 ) to the @xmath36 charmonium state possible @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "previous theoretical work about the origin of these particles has been done , supporting the interpretation of the y(3940 ) and the y(4140 ) as @xmath6 and @xmath37 molecules respectively .    in this paper",
    "we will propose a theoretical explanation on the nature of some of these xyz states , providing structure and quantum numbers for them .",
    "our work is based on the hidden gauge symmetry ( hgs ) formalism for the interaction of vector mesons , which was introduced by bando - kugo - yamawaki @xcite .",
    "concretely , we study the case of a system of two vector meson with charm @xmath0 and strangeness @xmath1 around @xmath2 mev ( hidden charm sector ) .",
    "within the theorical framework , there are two main ingredients : first , we take the lagrangians for the interaction of vector mesons among themselves , that come from the hidden gauge formalism of bando - kugo - yamawaki @xcite .",
    "second , we introduce the potential @xmath39 obtained from these lagrangians ( projected in s - wave , spin and isospin ) in the bethe salpeter equation : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the loop function . therefore , we are summing all the diagrams containing zero , one , two ... loops implicit in the bethe salpeter equation .",
    "finally , we look for poles of the unitary @xmath42 matrix in the second riemann sheet .",
    "all this procedure is well explained in @xcite . in these works ,",
    "two main vertices are taken into account for the computation of the potential @xmath39 : the four - vector - contact term and the three - vector vertex , which are provided respectively from the lagrangians : @xmath43 @xmath44 by means eq .",
    "( [ l3v ] ) , the vector exchange diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:3v4v ] are calculated .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:3v4v]d ) leads to a repulsive p - wave interaction for equal masses of the vectors @xcite and only to a minor component of s - wave in the case of different masses @xcite .",
    "thus , the four - vector - contact term in fig .",
    "[ fig:3v4v]a ) and the t(u)-channel vector exchange diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:3v4v]c ) are responsible for the generation of resonances or bound states if the interaction is strong enough .",
    "lagrangian : a ) four vector contact term , eq .",
    "( [ lcont ] ) ; b ) three - vector interaction , eq .",
    "( [ l3v ] ) ; c ) @xmath45 and @xmath46 channels from vector exchange ; d ) @xmath47 channel for vector exchange.,width=302 ]    as we are interested in the region close to the two vector meson threshold , the three momenta of the external particles can be neglected compared with the mass of the vector meson , and thus , we can make @xmath48 for external particles , which considerably simplify the calculation .    in order to consider the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar decay mode , and thus compare properly with the available experimental data for the width , a box diagram",
    "is also included , which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] for the particular case of the @xmath49 system . crossed box diagrams and box diagrams involving anomalous couplings were also calculated in @xcite , but they were much smaller , specially in the case of the anomalous coupling , than the contributions coming from the box diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] , and they were not considered in later works @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "two states were obtained within this formalism for the particular case of the @xmath50 system that were identified with the @xmath51 and the @xmath52 as @xmath49 molecular states . whereas in @xcite , the procedure of @xcite",
    "is extended to su(3 ) and eleven states are found , five of them can be associated with data in the pdg : the @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath51 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in these works ,",
    "the integral of two - vector - meson loop function can be calculated by means of the dimensional regularization method or by means of the use of a cutoff .",
    "this requires the introduction of one parameter , which is the subtraction constant ( or a cutoff parameter ) , that is tuned to reproduce the mass of the tensor states , whereas the other states are predicted .",
    "the box diagrams need two parameters , the cutoff for the integral , @xmath56 , and one parameter , @xmath57 , involved in the form factor used .",
    "these parameters were considered to be around @xmath58 gev and @xmath59 gev respectively in @xcite to get reasonable values of the @xmath52 and @xmath51 widths . in the later work of @xcite",
    ", these values also provide a good description of the widths for the other states .    in @xcite ,",
    "the work of @xcite is extended to su(4 ) in the study of the @xmath60 system . here ,",
    "the @xmath39 matrix is straigthforward extended to su(4 ) , as it was done in the work of @xcite : @xmath61 where the ideal mixing has been taken for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the su(4 ) symmetry is strongly broken by the explicit use of the masses of the vector mesons in the vector - exchange diagrams , where the terms of the potential that comes from the diagrams that exchange a @xmath65 meson are proportional to @xmath66 , and this gives rise to corrections of the order of @xmath67% of the @xmath68-exchange terms . in this work ,",
    "three states are obtained with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively , whereas the interaction is repulsive for @xmath72 and thus no exotics states appear .",
    "the subtraction constant @xmath73 in the function loop is fine - tuned around its natural value of @xmath74 @xcite , in order to get the position of the @xmath75 state at the pdg .",
    "the interesting thing comes from the calculation of the box diagram , this box diagram only has @xmath22 and @xmath71 , therefore , the state found with @xmath76 can not decay to @xmath77 by means of this mechanism , which is the reason why we get a small width of @xmath78 mev , compared with that of the state for @xmath79 , around @xmath80 mev @xcite .",
    "thus , we find a reasonable explanation for why the @xmath81 has a small width , @xmath82 mev , when we associate to this state the quantum numbers @xmath83 .",
    "the state for @xmath22 with mass around @xmath84 mev is a prediction of the model and there is no data over this state up to now .",
    "as one can see , the model in su(3 ) provides a good description of the properties of many physical states .",
    "also , in su(4 ) we have seen that interesting new states appear .",
    "thus , in the next section , we study the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 around the region of @xmath2 mev .",
    "in view of the results obtained in the cases of the vector - vector interaction in su(3 ) and the @xmath68(@xmath62 ) @xmath65 system in @xcite we make an attempt to study now the sector with @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the case of",
    "@xmath3 we have 10 channels : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and 6 channels for @xmath95 : @xmath85 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the procedure is identical to the one explained in the previou section , see @xcite for practical details , except by the complication added due to the many channels involved .",
    "the function loop is computed by means of dimensional regularization and we fix the value of @xmath99 mev as in the work of @xcite .",
    "we establish two different subtraction constants , one for the channels involving two light vector meson , which is called as @xmath100 , and the other one , for the channels involving two heavy vector meson : @xmath101 .",
    "when one channel involves both kind of mesons , one heavy and one light vector meson , we also put @xmath100 .",
    "the value of @xmath100 is set to get the position of the pole @xmath51 as @xmath102 , like it was done in the work of @xcite .",
    "thus , we get the correct position of the poles found in this work .",
    "the @xmath101 constant is set to @xmath103 in order to get the position of the pole found in @xmath1 around @xmath104 mev . by the fact of having several channels , ones involving heavy mesons and the other light mesons ,",
    "the @xmath105 parameter in the lagrangian must be different for the different cases .",
    "thus , we put @xmath106 for light mesons , and @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , when one @xmath65 , @xmath110 or @xmath64 meson is involved .",
    "the @xmath12 decay mode is also considered by means of a box diagram as it was done in @xcite , but the effect is small compared with the ( light ) vector-(light or heavy ) vector decay modes .",
    "the results for the pole position obtained together with a possible assignment with some of the xyz particles observed in the energy region of @xmath2 mev is given in table [ tab : thexp ] . in order to do a proper comparison with the experiment , we give in table [ tab : olsen ]",
    "the xyz discovered up to now in which we are interested , which is taken from @xcite .    as it is shown in table [ tab : thexp ] , we find one pole with a mass @xmath111 mev for each spin @xmath112 and @xmath71 and @xmath3 .",
    "the modules of the coupling contants to the different channels are obtained from the residues of the amplitudes and they are given in tables [ tab : res0 ] and [ tab : res1 ] . from table [ tab : res0 ] , we see that these three poles around @xmath104 mev are about @xmath113% @xmath6 and @xmath114% @xmath115 , whereas all the other channels account only for @xmath116% or less . in table [ tab : olsen ] ( experimental data ) there are also three states around this mass .",
    "the state that we found for @xmath95 is discarded to be associated with one of these states , because in our model this state decays to @xmath12 and not to @xmath13 , thus can not be associated with the x(3940 ) , since the @xmath12 decay has not been observed @xcite , whereas it can not be associated to the y(3940 ) either , because the experimental state decays to @xmath13 . on the other hand , we find a width so large that it is likely to be assigned to the z(3930 ) . in that way ,",
    "the state found for @xmath95 is a prediction of the model . in table",
    "[ tab : thexp ] we call it as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 stands for prediction .",
    "for this state , we find that the @xmath6 channel contributes @xmath119% , whereas the sum of the modules of the couplings for the rest of the channels gives @xmath120% .",
    "although , at first one could think that the three states that we found around @xmath104 mev for @xmath3 could correspond to those in table [ tab : olsen ] , this assignment can lead to error .",
    "the reason is that all the three experimental states have c - parity positive , while our state for @xmath76 has c - parity negative . from the experimental point of view",
    ", this is clear by the production mechanism : @xmath121 has c - parity negative ( it comes from a photon ) and as the @xmath64 has also c - parity negative , the x(3940 ) must have c - parity positive .",
    "thus , the state that we found for @xmath76 is also a prediction .    in table",
    "[ tab : olsen ] , we find that there are two different experimental measures for the mass and width of the y(3940 ) .",
    "one is done by babar and the other one by belle with bigger values for both magnitudes .",
    "the point in favor to the assignment of the state that we found with @xmath122 to the y(3940 ) is the calculation of the @xmath123)\\to \\omega j/\\psi)$ ] that can be done straightforwardly by means of the formula : @xmath124)\\to \\omega j/\\psi)=\\frac{p\\,|g_{y\\omega j/\\psi}|^2}{8 \\pi\\,m_y^2 }   \\label{decay}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is the momentum of @xmath62 in the resonance rest frame .",
    "taking the modules of the coupling @xmath125 mev from table [ tab : res0 ] , we obtain @xmath123)\\to \\omega j/\\psi)=1.52 $ ] mev , compatible with the expected experimental value for this decay , @xmath126 mev @xcite . then , we have found a natural explanation on why this rate is much larger than it would be if it corresponded to a hadronic transition between charmonium states .    on the other hand , the two states that we find in @xmath3 for @xmath79 , with masses @xmath127 and @xmath128 mev , are assigned to the z(3930 ) and x(4160 ) respectively , by the proximity of the mass , width and quantum numbers .",
    "the structure of the state found with @xmath129 mev is radically different to the other states .",
    "we see from table [ tab : res0 ] , that the @xmath115 coupling accounts for the @xmath130% , whereas the @xmath6 coupling gives only the @xmath131% , being the sum of the contributions of all the other channels of @xmath132% .",
    ".comparison of the mass , width and quantum numbers with the experiment .",
    "all the quantities are in units of mev . [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sector around the energy region of @xmath2 mev within the hidden gauge formalism combined with coupled channel unitarity .",
    "we find one state with mass @xmath111 mev for each spin @xmath112 and @xmath71 . only the states with @xmath22 and @xmath71 can be associated the xyz particles with mass @xmath111 mev in the pdg .",
    "concretely , we associate the @xmath122 state with the y(3940 ) , and the @xmath5 state with z(3930 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath133 can not be associated with known states and it becomes a prediction .",
    "the only state that we find for @xmath95 , with @xmath134 , can not be associated either , because of the decay modes and the large width .",
    "this new prediction could be observed in the @xmath135 channel . for those states with masses around @xmath104 mev , we find that the @xmath6 channel accounts for the @xmath113% .",
    "our model predicts another state with mass around @xmath136 mev and quantum numbers @xmath137=0^+[2^{++}]$ ] , which we identify as the x(4160 ) by the proximity of the mass , width and c - parity .",
    "this state has a different structure , being the @xmath138 channel the one contributing most to the generation of the state .",
    "the region around @xmath104 mev is very interesting and there could be more resonances not yet seen in this region .",
    "the findings of this work should motivate the experimentalist to look into this region in the channels that involve light vector - light vector or light vector - heavy vector like @xmath139 and @xmath135 .",
