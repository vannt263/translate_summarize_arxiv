    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are thought to be the observational manifestations of a class of ultramagnetic ( @xmath0  g ) neutron stars , also called magnetars ( see woods & thompson 2006 and kaspi 2006 for reviews on magnetars and axps ) . among the numerous spectral and timing properties of these isolated x - ray sources , two stand out for our focus in these proceedings .",
    "their x - ray spectra are soft but non - planckian , traditionally described by empirical functions such as a blackbody ( kt @xmath1 0.3@xmath20.6 kev ) plus a power law ( with photon index @xmath32.5@xmath24 ) and , less frequently , by a sum of two blackbody functions ( see , e.g. , gotthelf & halpern 2005 ; kaspi 2006 ) .",
    "the second property is their high spin - down rates , with @xmath4  s  s@xmath5 .    a convincing , albeit indirect , argument for their strong magnetic fields arises from these large spindown rates ( e.g. , kouveliotou et al .  1998 ) . assuming the neutron stars spin down due to magnetic braking of a dipole in vacuum , their magnetic field strengths can be estimated by @xmath6  g , for a neutron star moment - of - inertia @xmath7  g  @xmath8 and a neutron star radius of @xmath9  km .",
    "the dipole fields associated with axps thus exceed @xmath10  g. the dipole spindown formula makes numerous assumptions when connecting period derivatives with a magnetic field strength , such as a fiducial angle between the magnetic and rotation axes and the absence of other torques on the neutron star ( spitkovsky 2006 ) . the dipole magnetic field inferred in this way has never been compared with an independent , spectroscopic measurement for an isolated pulsar .",
    "recently , there has been significant theoretical work on the emission from the atmospheres and magnetospheres of magnetars . as part of these efforts",
    ", we have developed a physical model of emission from a magnetar that takes into account processes in its atmosphere as well as in its magnetosphere .",
    "the surface thermal emission and magnetospheric scattering ( stems ) model is based on the radiative equilibrium atmosphere calculations presented in zel ( 2003 ) but also includes the effects of magnetospheric scattering of the surface radiation as discussed in lyutikov & gavriil ( 2006 ) and gver , zel & lyutikov ( 2006 ) .",
    "we also take into account the general relativistic effects in the strong gravitational field of the neutron star , making our models directly comparable to the wealth of spectral and timing data on axps .",
    "naturally , comparison with such data is the ultimate test of any theoretical model . at the same time , a model that can describe consistently and in detail the spectra of axps can be used to understand the physical properties of these sources and their emission mechanisms .    in this proceedings paper , we present the results of applying the surface magnetospheric scattering and surface emission model to the soft x - ray data of four axps .",
    "in particular , we measure the magnetic field strength of these sources spectroscopically and we investigate the connection between the spectroscopically determined magnetic field strengths with those inferred from dipole spindown .",
    "in highly magnetic , ionized neutron star atmospheres , polarization - mode dependent transport of radiation that includes absorption , emission , and scattering processes determines the continuum spectrum ( see , e.g. , zel 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , the interaction of the photons with the protons in the plasma gives rise to an absorption feature at the proton cyclotron energy @xmath11 .",
    "this absorption feature is weakened by the vacuum polarization resonance , which also leads to an enhanced conversion between photons of different polarization modes as they propagate through the atmosphere .",
    "in the magnetospheres of magnetars , currents supporting the ultrastrong magnetic fields can lead to enhanced charge densities ( thompson , lyutikov , & kulkarni 2002 ) , which reprocess the surface radiation through resonant cyclotron scattering ( lyutikov & gavriil 2006 ; gver , zel , & lyutikov 2007 ) .",
    "we calculate this effect using the green s function approach described in lyutikov & gavriil ( 2006 ) assuming that the magnetosphere is spherically symmetric and the field strength follows a 1/@xmath12 dependence .    in our spectral models , we include the relevant processes that take place on the magnetar surface and its magnetosphere , which depend only on four physical parameters .",
    "the first two parameters , the surface magnetic field strength @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 , describe the conditions found on the neutron star surface .",
    "the third parameter denotes the average energy of the charges @xmath15 in the magnetosphere , while the last parameter is related to the density @xmath16 of such charges and indicates the optical depth to resonant scattering by @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 is the cross - section for resonant cyclotron scattering",
    ". we also assume a fixed value for the gravitational acceleration on the neutron star surface of @xmath19  cm  s@xmath20 , obtained for reasonable values of the neutron star mass and radius .",
    "we calculated model x - ray spectra ( in the 0.05 - 9.8 kev range ) by varying model parameters in suitable ranges that are in line with the physical processes we incorporated into the models : surface temperature @xmath21 to @xmath22  kev , magnetic field @xmath23 to @xmath24 g , electron velocity @xmath25 to 0.5 , and optical depth in the magnetosphere @xmath26 to 10 . from the set of calculated spectra",
    ", we created a table model which we use within the x - ray spectral analysis package xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) to model the x - ray spectra of axps .",
    "our models predict strong deviations from a planckian spectrum , with a hard excess that depends on the surface temperature as well as the magnetic field strength , and weak absorption lines due to the proton cyclotron resonance .",
    "both the atmospheric processes and the magnetospheric scattering play a role in forming these spectral features and especially in reducing the equivalent widths of the cyclotron lines .",
    "in this proceedings paper , we present the analysis of a total of four xmm - newton observations of four axps . for 4u",
    "0142@xmath2761 , 1rxs  j1708@xmath24009 , and xte  j1810@xmath2197 we chose the longest available x - ray observation carried out by xmm or chandra observatories ( i.e. , the observation with the highest total counts ) . for 1e  1048.1@xmath25937",
    ", we used the longest observation of this source in quiescence . a longer observation taken just after a burst from this source will be presented elsewhere .",
    ".observations used for this study . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "figure  5 shows the magnetic field strengths obtained for the 4 axps by fitting their x - ray spectra with the stems model against the dipole field strengths inferred from the spindown of these sources according to the dipole spindown formula .",
    "the error bars correspond to @xmath28 uncertainty in the values of the spectroscopic magnetic field strength , while error bars on the dipole spindown field reflect the range obtained from the variable period derivatives seen in some sources .      in the cases of 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 , 1rxs  j1708@xmath24009 , and xte  j1810@xmath2197",
    ", we find a very good agreement , at an unexpected level , between the spectroscopically measured magnetic field strength and that obtained from their spindown . in all three cases ,",
    "the two values are consistent within the formal and expected systematic uncertainties .",
    "for the case of 4u  0142@xmath2761 , the spectroscopically measured surface magnetic field is a factor of 3 larger than the spindown field .",
    "this may be due to the simplified assumptions in either of the two measurements of the magnetic field .",
    "alternatively , this might be an indication of multipole magnetic field components on the neutron star surface which contribute negligibly to the spindown torques .",
    "the good agreement between the theoretical models and the spectral data provide us with a new tool with which to understand the physical conditions of magnetar surfaces and magnetospheres . at the same time , our spectroscopic measurements of the magnetic field strengths offer independent confirmation for the magnetar nature of axps .    f.o . acknowledges support from nsf grant ast-0708640 .",
