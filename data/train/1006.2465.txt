    "at present , we have two intriguing issues on a magnetic order or fluctuation occurring close to @xmath4 in @xmath2-wave paired superconducting states .",
    "one is the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) quantum critical behavior reflected in transport measurements around @xmath4 of heavy fermion superconductors cecoin@xmath3 [ 1 - 3 ] , pressured cerhin@xmath3 [ 4 ] , nppd@xmath3al@xmath5 [ 5 ] , and tl - based cuprates [ 6 ] .",
    "the other is the afm order [ 7 ] in the high field and low temperature ( hflt ) phase [ 8 ] of cecoin@xmath3 which has been identified , based on measurements [ 9,10 ] and theoretical explanations [ 11,12 ] of elastic properties and doping effects , with a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state [ 8,13 ] .",
    "it is notable that the materials listed above have a couple of common features , such as the @xmath2-wave pairing and a strong pauli paramagnetic depairing ( pd ) .    in this report , we point out that , in _ nodal _ @xmath2-wave superconductors , a field - induced enhancement of pd tends to induce an afm ordering in the superconducting phase just below @xmath4 .",
    "conventionally , the afm ordering is suppressed by the superconducting ordering in zero field [ 14 ] , and , even in nonzero fields , the quasiparticle damping effect brought by the afm fluctuation usually suppresses a relatively weak pd effect , suggesting a competition between the two orderings .",
    "it is found , however , that a strong pd rather favors coexistence of a @xmath2-wave superconductivity and an _ incommensurate _",
    "afm order , leading to an enhancement of afm ordering or fluctuation just below @xmath4 .",
    "we work in a bcs - like electronic hamiltonian [ 14 ] with the superconducting energy gap @xmath6 and the afm moment @xmath7 . by treating @xmath6 at the mean field level and @xmath8 as a fluctuation , respectively ,",

    "at least in the case with a continuous @xmath31-transition like fig.2 ( a ) below , the orbital depairing needs to be incorporated through the familiar quasiclassical treatment on the quasiparticle green s function [ 13 ] .

    "let us first explain the @xmath55 case in which @xmath56 . in this case , the two terms in eq.(3 )",
    "are found to take the same form as the coefficient of the o(@xmath57 ) term of the superconducting ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy and thus , change their sign upon cooling [ 13 ] .",
    "hence , @xmath58 becomes positive for stronger pd , leading to a lower @xmath59 , i.e. , an _ enhancement _ of the afm ordering in the superconducting phase . as well as the corresponding pd - induced sign - change of the o(@xmath57 ) term which leads to the first order @xmath31-transition [ 13 ]",
    ", the pd - induced positive @xmath60 is also unaffected by inclusion of the orbital depairing .    in @xmath61 where @xmath62 , a different type of pd - induced afm ordering occurs in a @xmath2-wave pairing case with a gap node along @xmath1 where @xmath63 :",

    "the actual afm transition temperature in @xmath95 for @xmath96 and @xmath97 are zero and less than @xmath98 , respectively , because of the finite @xmath99 used in the calculation . reflecting the afm ordering enhanced by pd , the decrease of @xmath94 , corresponding to an increase of pressure , results in the shrinkage of the afm phase just below @xmath4 , which reduces to an apparent afm quantum critical point by a further increase of pressure .",

    "an apparent afm quantum critical point is estimated , in @xmath100 , to lie at a lower field than @xmath4 in spite of the pd - induced afm ordering just below @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the observations in cecoin@xmath3 [ 2,7 ] .",
    "we note that the anomalous doping effect in cecoin@xmath3 [ 10 ] can not be explained without a spatial modulation of @xmath101 in the hflt phase [ 12 ] , implying that both the afm and fflo orders coexist in the hflt phase of cecoin@xmath3 .",
    "calculation results in the case including the fflo structure will be reported elsewhere [ 15 ] .",
    "we note that , in the present theory explaining the afm order just below @xmath4 in cecoin@xmath3 with strong pd , the assumption [ 16 ] of an additional pairing channel ( pair - density wave ) is unnecessary , and that both of the afm order [ 7 ] and other observations , such as the anomalous doping effect [ 10 ] , in the hflt phase of cecoin@xmath3 are explained consistently if the fflo modulation in the hflt phase is assumed .",
