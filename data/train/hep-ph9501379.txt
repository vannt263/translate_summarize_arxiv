    "the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is the foremost open question in particle physics today .",
    "one direct approach to this question is to search for higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "a complementary approach is to study the scattering of pairs of longitudinally polarized weak bosons @xcite @xmath18 ( where and henceforth , @xmath19 generically denotes @xmath5 and @xmath6 unless specified otherwise ) , since at high energies they recall their origins as goldstone bosons and reflect the ewsb dynamics , thanks to an equivalence theorem @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",

    "but in general , if there is no higgs boson below about 0.8 tev , the scattering of @xmath18 pairs is expected to become strong at cm energies of order @xmath2  tev .",
    "a variety of models of the strongly - interacting electro - weak sector ( sews ) have been put forward to parameterize this strong scattering , to impose the constraints of unitarity and crossing , and to characterize different ewsb possibilities  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we first point out that the cross section ratio @xmath22 @xmath23 is a sensitive probe of the sews , since different models predict very different ratios .",
    "we then suggest ways in which this ratio may be extracted from a `` next @xmath3 linear collider '' ( nlc ) with the cm energy @xmath24  tev through the @xmath25 fusion processes  @xcite @xmath26 in studies of strong @xmath7 scattering at hadron colliders , it is necessary for identification to use leptonic @xmath27 decays , which have the disadvantages of an invisible neutrino and/or small branching fractions . at @xmath28 colliders",
    "we are able to exploit the hadronic decays , which have the advantages of large branching fractions and reconstructibility . here",
    "we rely on @xmath29 hadronic decays , with sufficient dijet mass resolution to provide statistical discrimination between @xmath25 and @xmath30 final states .",
    "we suggest cuts to minimize the principal backgrounds from transverse @xmath19-pair production that are intrinsic in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wwfusion ] ) , and also come from @xmath31 where the final - state electrons escape undetected along the beam - pipe , as well as from the annihilation channel  @xcite @xmath32 we discuss the prospects for discriminating between @xmath33 and @xmath30 final states and make illustrative calculations to show what may be learned from experiments .",
    "the process @xmath10 is unique to explore the weak `` isospin '' @xmath34 non - resonant channel @xcite .",
    "we therefore include a comparison of results at both @xmath3 and @xmath35 colliders .",
    "we also show the improvements that would come from using polarized electron beams , in both @xmath3 and @xmath35 cases .",
    "the sews effects become significantly larger as energy increases .",
    "we therefore demonstrate the enhancement of the signal rate at a 2 tev @xmath3 collider and possible @xmath11 circular colliders with larger cm energies  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii presents the models to be compared .",
    "section iii discusses the question of dijet mass resolution .",
    "section iv describes our methods of calculation and the motivation for our choices of acceptance cuts .",
    "results are presented and discussed in the final two sections .",
    "we conclude that at a 1.5 tev nlc with an integrated luminosity of 200 fb@xmath9 , it should be feasible to extract information on sews by separately studying @xmath25 and @xmath30 events .",
    "if we ignore gauge couplings and the mass @xmath37 the scattering of real longitudinal weak bosons @xmath38 due to ewsb interactions is the same as the scattering of the corresponding goldstone bosons @xcite and can be parametrized by an amplitude @xmath39 as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "we recall that the amplitudes @xmath44 for total isospin @xmath45 , which should obey unitarity , are then given by @xmath46 unitarity may be monitored through the partial wave amplitudes @xmath47 for orbital angular momentum @xmath48 , @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "the unitarity condition @xmath51 is sometimes approximated by requiring @xmath52 or @xmath53 .    various models for these scattering amplitudes have been suggested @xcite . we shall concentrate on models resulting from effective chiral lagrangians , with and without resonances , as follows .",
    "the equivalence theorem @xcite gives the amplitude @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the higgs boson mass and width , @xmath57 gev is the usual vacuum expectation value , and @xmath58 for @xmath59 . in all models , @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    "are obtained by permuting @xmath62 .",
    "this simply extrapolates the amplitudes , prescribed at low energy in terms of @xmath63 @xmath64 and is the @xmath65 limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a(stu ) ] ) .",
    "this model eventually violates unitarity ; e.g.  @xmath66 violates the bound @xmath67 when @xmath68 tev and the less stringent bound @xmath69 when @xmath70 tev , where @xmath71 denotes the @xmath7 invariant mass squared .",
    "our present illustrations scarcely approach these non - unitary ranges .",
    "however , at higher energies we can unitarize the amplitudes by a cut - off or by the @xmath72-matrix prescription @xmath73 which enforces the elastic unitarity condition @xmath74 .",

    "the sm amplitude with @xmath78 is recovered for @xmath79 .",
    "we choose @xmath80 tev and @xmath81 tev , for which @xmath82 ; unsurprisingly , the results are similar to the sm case .",

    "we choose the case @xmath88  tev with @xmath89  gev .",
    "note that the cross section for vector resonance production increases as the width @xmath86 becomes larger .",
    "the choice of a rather narrow width in our study is motivated from lep - i constraints via the @xmath90 mixing @xcite .    in our signal calculations",
    ", we will concentrate on the processes of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wwfusion ] ) , which go via the @xmath25 initial state , since the charged current coupling to the electron is larger than the neutral current coupling",
    ". we can calculate model ( a ) directly from the complete sm amplitudes without recourse to the goldstone boson scattering amplitude @xmath39 ; the latter is shown above simply for comparison .",
    "the same is true for model ( b ) , in regions where unitarity is respected .",
    "for these two cases , we define the sews signals as the excesses of heavy higgs boson results over that of @xmath91 . models ( c ) and ( d ) must however be calculated from the @xmath39 expressions , using the effective w - boson approximation @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the ratio of @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections is a sensitive probe of the sews @xcite , since the models have distinctive particle spectra with different weak isospin content . for a scalar - dominance model ,",
    "one expects the @xmath92 rate to be larger than @xmath93 ; _",
    "e.g. _ a sm - like higgs boson dominating in the @xmath71-channel gives @xmath94 2 . for a vector - dominance model",
    "there would be a significant resonant enhancement in the @xmath92 mode , but not in @xmath95 due to the weak isospin conservation in sews ( just like @xmath96 but not @xmath97 in qcd ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the resonances are far from our reach , then the let amplitudes behave like @xmath98 for @xmath99 and like @xmath100 for @xmath101 , so that @xmath102 .",
    "the @xmath95 rate is then larger than @xmath103 , and even more so in the central scattering region .",
    "measuring the relative yields of @xmath92 and @xmath95 will therefore reveal important characteristics of the sews .",
    "we consider @xmath5 and @xmath6 bosons detected by their dijet decay modes and identified via the dijet invariant masses @xmath104 , @xmath105 . with realistic mass resolution",
    ", discrimination can not be made event - by - event but can be achieved on a statistical basis .",
    "the experimental @xmath19 dijet mass distributions will contain the intrinsic decay widths folded with experimental resolution factors depending on calorimetry and geometry .",
    "we have explored the possible dijet mass resolution using two alternative jet energy resolution algorithms  @xcite @xmath106 in gev units , where the symbol @xmath107 means adding in quadrature .",
    "we applied this to the typical sm background process @xmath108 at @xmath109  tev , averaging over all final @xmath110 dijet decays with gaussian smearing of jet energies according to these algorithms ; the resulting @xmath111 and @xmath112 dijet invariant mass distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dijetmass ] .",
    "since this study omits angular resolution effects , sensitive to details of detector design , we shall adopt the more conservative algorithm  a for further illustrations .    if we now identify dijets having measured mass in the intervals @xmath113 \\quad { \\rm and }   \\quad [ { 1\\over 2}(m_w+m_z ) , \\ ; 1.15m_z]\\ ] ] as @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively , algorithm a indicates that true @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 events will be interpreted statistically as follows : @xmath117 these numbers show that misidentification of @xmath114 as @xmath30 ( or vice versa ) is very unlikely ; also the loss of @xmath114 or @xmath30 signal strength is not in itself very serious .",
    "the principal danger comes from @xmath115 events that are misidentified as @xmath114 or @xmath30 , confusing or even swamping these signals if @xmath115 production is relatively large .",
    "we must therefore ensure , via suitable acceptance criteria , that @xmath115 production is not an order of magnitude bigger than @xmath114 or @xmath30 signal .    a final caveat : the numbers above refer strictly to light - quark jets . in @xmath118- and @xmath119-quark jets there is an appreciable probability of @xmath120 and/or @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) semileptonic decays , where neutrinos deplete the visible jet energy .",
    "thus more @xmath112 dijets will be interpreted as @xmath111 , but _ not _ vice versa .",
    "we have modeled this effect in typical situations with scenario  a and find that the correction to the @xmath111 results is rather small .",
    "however , about 8@xmath123 more @xmath115 events are now identified as @xmath114 ( increasing this source of background ) ; also about 10@xmath123 more @xmath30 events are now identified as @xmath115 ( increasing this loss of signal ) .",
    "these changes are significant but not disastrous .",
    "the resulting modified identification probabilities are as follows : @xmath124 and we will use these numbers in the rest of our analyses .",
    "when the dijet mass resolution function is known , for a given detector , the apparent @xmath125 and @xmath30 rates can be unfolded to determine approximately the underlying true rates . in the following ,",
    "we first concentrate our attention on these true rates , and then use the examples above to estimate resolution effects .",
    "the sm signals for @xmath126 fusion processes with a heavy higgs boson have been considered previously , along with certain sm backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "the irreducible sm backgrounds to the strongly - interacting electro - weak sector , which include transversely polarized vector bosons @xmath127 and @xmath128 production , can be obtained by setting @xmath129 ; further backgrounds arise from misidentifying other sm channels in eq .",

    "it is important at @xmath130 tev  @xcite , but unlike the scattering channels , its cross section increases slowly with @xmath131 above the threshold and then decreases after @xmath132 tev , like @xmath133 asymptotically . at @xmath134 tev the total annihilation background cross section is of order 10 fb ( taking into account three flavors of the neutrinos from the @xmath6 decay ) , comparable to the sews signals .",
    "it can be reduced severely , however , by a cut on the recoil mass @xmath135 that is the invariant mass of all the final - state particles excluding the @xmath136 system : @xmath137 where the @xmath19 boson energies @xmath138 are defined in the @xmath3 cm frame and @xmath131 is the cm energy of the @xmath3 collider . the recoil - mass spectrum of the annihilation eq .",
    "( 3 ) peaks at @xmath139 , due to the @xmath140 decay , but this peak is smeared out by the contributions of initial - state radiation as well as the mismeasurement of the @xmath19 hadronic energies .",
    "a cut such as @xmath141 therefore effectively suppresses the annihilation background .",
    "figure  [ fig : recoil ] shows that this background is reduced to about 12% of typical sews signals , with negligible effect on the scattering channels at @xmath24 tev .",
    "we shall henceforth make this cut and neglect the annihilation background of eq .",

    "we start with the most basic acceptance cuts .",

    "figure  [ fig : mwwmzz ] immediately illustrates the main point of this paper , that the @xmath13 signal ratio is sensitive to the details of sews ; we see that the sm heavy higgs model ( @xmath142 tev ) gives @xmath149 whereas the let model ( @xmath148 ) gives @xmath150 .",
    "it also shows that the @xmath30 signals around @xmath151 tev are bigger than the backgrounds , since section iii indicates that the @xmath25 background has very small ( @xmath152 ) probability to be misidentified as @xmath30 , but more work is needed to separate the @xmath25 signals .",
    "the sm @xmath153 background gets very large contributions from the virtual @xmath154 subprocess , which gives mainly dibosons with small net transverse momentum @xmath155 , quite unlike the sews signal and other backgrounds .",

    "the improvement comes mainly from including the @xmath225 process and from our optimized kinematical cuts to suppress the backgrounds while maximally preserving the sews signal . + * ( d ) * we have concentrated on @xmath226 final states , neglecting @xmath162 signals , because the heavy higgs boson contribution to the latter is negligibly small compared to the irreducible sm background ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sews ] ) .",
    "however , the presence of an @xmath227 vector state would greatly enhance the cross section for @xmath228 @xcite . our optimal kinematical cuts and the @xmath229 reconstruction should be essentially applicable to the @xmath219 channel and a wider study including",
    "this channel would provide consistency checks on sews effects .",
    "+ * ( e ) * the let amplitudes we employed correspond to the lowest order universal term in the energy expansion in effective chiral lagrangians @xcite .",
    "the magnitude and sign of coefficients of higher dimension operators ( the so - called anomalous couplings ) in the lagrangians would depend on specific sews models .",
    "in the clean environment at the nlc , one may be able to measure the shape as well as the normalization of the @xmath7 mass distribution rather well .",
    "if this can be achieved , one may even hope to study the non - resonance amplitudes in detail to go beyond the let term and to extract the underlying dynamics at higher mass scales beyond @xmath230(1 tev ) . + * ( f ) * finally , in studying a scalar or a vector resonance , we have followed the simplest approach of assuming just one resonance at a time .",
    "it has been emphasized recently @xcite that there may coexist several resonances ( as in low energy qcd ) , a scalar ( @xmath209-like ) , a vector ( @xmath184-like ) , an axial vector ( @xmath231-like ) and an isospin - singlet vector ( @xmath232-like ) , obeying some algebraic relations to satisfy the proper regge behavior and certain sum rules of strong scattering @xcite",
    ". there would be definite relations among the masses and couplings of these resonances , leading to cancellation and other predictions in the strong scattering amplitudes .",
    "this possibility deserves further scrutiny in studying sews effects at colliders .",
