    "the millimeter wave ( mmwave ) bands , roughly between 30 and 300  ghz , are an attractive candidate for next - generation cellular systems due to the vast quantities of spectrum and the potential for exploiting very high - dimensional antenna arrays @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , a significant issue in realizing these systems is power consumption , particularly in handheld mobile devices .",
    "in addition to the high power consumed baseband processing , one critical concern is the power consumption in the analog - digital conversion ( adc ) due to the need to process large number of antenna outputs and very wide bandwidths .",
    "classical information theoretic formulation @xcite characterizes the maximum achievable communication rate on a channel as a function on the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and bandwidth .",
    "the broad goal of this paper is to understand what the information theoretic limits on communication in the presence of constraints on the adc power consumption are and how we can design communication systems to meet these limits .",
    "although a closed form expression for the optimal input and capacity of a 1-bit quantizer is given in @xcite , it is difficult to obtain the capacity and input distributions of multi - bit quantizer .",
    "therefore , we restrict our analysis to an additive quantization noise model ( aqnm ) @xcite . under this assumption",
    ", adc power constraints can be easily abstracted as constraints on the sampling rate and quantizer noise level .",
    "we can then obtain lower bounds on the capacity and investigate the optimal bandwidth and resolution of the adc such that the achievable rate is maximized .",
    "we first study the effect of bandwidth and sampling rate of adc on the performance of single - input and single output ( siso ) system under the total receiver power budget including the adc power cost .",
    "we next consider multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) point - to - point systems operating over a large bandwidth .",
    "our analysis considers both spatial multiplexing and beamforming  the two basic methods for mimo systems @xcite .",
    "spatial multiplexing is favorable when the channel is bandwidth - limited and the snr is high .",
    "however , beamforming provides power gain and is beneficial if the channel is power - limited as in most of the mmwave systems due to available wide bandwidth and high path loss @xcite .    for mmwave mimo systems",
    ", there are three receiver combining methods that need to be considered : analog combining , digital combining and hybrid analog / digital combining @xcite .",
    "digital combining is the method in use in conventional cellular transceivers today where each antenna element has a separate pair of adcs .",
    "this method offers the greatest flexibility , but highest power consumption for a given adc resolution and sampling rate .",
    "an alternate design is to combine the signals in analog ( either in rf or if ) so that only one pair of adcs is required per stream @xcite-@xcite .",
    "hybrid beamforming @xcite uses a two stage combination of these designs .",
    "see @xcite for a general discussion .",
    "since power dissipation of adc scales linearly in sampling rate and exponentially in the number of bits per sample @xcite , it may not be desirable to operate the system over the full bandwidth and high resolution .",
    "therefore , digital combining can save energy by using narrow band ( low sampling rate ) and low resolution adcs while increasing its effective received snr and allowing the spatial multiplexing at the transmitter for better performance . as a result ,",
    "analysis of performance trade - off of analog and digital combining is essential for power limited receivers .    to compare these architectures , we derive achievable rates of the mimo system with both analog combining and digital combining and study the effect of bandwidth , adc resolution and the number of antennas on the achievable rate .",
    "constraints are placed on the total front - end receiver power or only the adc power .",
    "we expect most of the simulation results for the hybrid analog / digital combining to be somewhere between analog and digital combining , and hence we leave detailed analysis of this as a future work .    under these power constraints ,",
    "our results show that :    * for a point - to - point siso system when bandwidth is large as in mmwave systems , there exists an optimal bandwidth and resolution of the adc . as a consequence , it may not be desirable to operate the system over the full bandwidth . * for a point - to - point mimo system when only adc power consumption is considered , we see that at least in some operating regimes , analog combining may have higher maximum achievable rate than digital combining",
    ". however , in these cases , digital combining can attain its maximum rate at much less bandwidth .",
    "indeed , as the number of antennas at the transmitter and receiver @xmath0 increases , the utilized bandwidth decreases by a factor of @xmath1 . * for a point - to - point mimo system when the power consumption of all receiver components including adcs are considered , digital combining may be able to achieve a higher rate when the channel state information is available at the transmitter .      in recent years , energy efficient transceiver architectures such as use of low resolution adcs and hybrid analog / digital precoding ( combining ) has attracted significant interest .",
    "the limits of communication over additive white gaussian channel with low resolution ( 1 - 3 ) bits adcs at the receiver is studied in @xcite .",
    "this is extended in @xcite to the capacity of the 1-bit adc with oversampling at the receiver .",
    "the bounds on the capacity of the mimo channel with 1-bit adc at high and low snr regimes are derived in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "using aqnm of adc , the joint optimization of adc resolution with the number of antennas in a mimo channel is studied in @xcite .",
    "there is also rich literature on the hybrid analog / digital transceivers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "while @xcite provides efficient hybrid precoding and combining algorithms for sparse mmwave channels which performs close to full digital solution , @xcite combines efficient channel estimation with the hybrid precoding and combining algorithm in @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there is no work which considers the effects of both sampling rate ( bandwidth ) and resolution of adc on the performance of the system under a total receiver power constraint .",
    "in addition , we investigate and compare the performance of analog and digital combining and optimize the resolution , bandwidth and the number of antennas .",
    "it should be noted that our analysis would likely apply most closely to data plane traffic where the overhead for channel tracking is relatively small . for initial synchronization , where the channel or even the presence of the transmitting base station may not be known ,",
    "digital combining can have distinct advantages not accounted for in this analysis ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we consider a point - to - point mmwave communication system operating over a bandwidth @xmath2 hz .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath3 antennas at the transmitter and @xmath4 antennas at the receiver .",
    "we assume additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with power spectral density @xmath5 watts / hz .",
    "the transmitted signal has average power constraint @xmath6 watts .",
    "the channel exhibits frequency selective fading , which is independent across frequency bands and across antennas .",
    "the instantaneous fading realizations are assumed to be known at the receiver .",
    "we consider two receiver architectures as shown in figure  [ sys ] : digital combining and analog combining . as shown in the figure , for digital combining , adcs",
    "are employed to quantize the signal before the baseband combiner .",
    "each block labeled  i / q adc \" represents two adcs  one for the inphase and another for the quadrature components , both with sampling rate equal to the nyquist rate . in the analog combining architecture , the signals",
    "are combined in analog with phase shifters , and then digitized with a single i / q adc .",
    "thus , for rf analog combining , we have @xmath4 low noise amplifiers ( lnas ) , @xmath4 phase shifters , one combiner , one mixer and one i / q adc , while the digital combining architecture consists of only @xmath4 lnas and @xmath4 mixers @xcite , but @xmath4 adcs .    we assume that for either analog or digital combing , each adc consists of a @xmath7-bin scalar quantizer . note that in @xcite , it is proved that for @xmath7-bin output quantization , at most @xmath8 mass points at the input are enough to achieve the capacity .",
    "however , obtaining the optimal input distribution for arbitrary number of quantization bins is difficult .",
    "therefore , in this paper , in order to get insights , we use an aqnm for the quantizer and find a lower bound to the capacity of the corresponding channel by assuming gaussian quantization noise and gaussian inputs .",
    "further benefits of aqnm include ease of implementation since the decoder can use standard linear processing and gaussian decoding .",
    "we denote the output of the adc corresponding to input @xmath9 by @xmath10 .",
    "we consider that the quantizer output @xmath11 is chosen such that @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the quantizer @xmath13 can be represented by the following aqnm @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the additive quantization noise such that @xmath9 and @xmath15 are uncorrelated .",
    "note that @xmath16&=&(1- \\alpha ) e[z]\\\\\\label{eq2 } \\sigma_{n_q}^2&=&(1-\\alpha)\\alpha \\sigma_z^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath17 is variance of additive quantization noise .",
    "accordingly , @xmath18 can be computed as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the variance of quantization error , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is variance of the quantization input . in @xcite , @xmath24 is referred as the coding gain .    motivated by @xcite we assume that @xmath25 has the gaussian distribution . furthermore , since the gaussian input maximizes the mutual information between the input and the output when the noise is gaussian , we assume that the input to the mimo channel is jointly gaussian . accordingly , for non - uniform scalar mmse quantizer of a gaussian random variable , @xmath26 can be approximated to @xmath27 , where @xmath7 is the number of quantization bins @xcite . in this paper , without loss of generality we assume that @xmath28 for some constant @xmath29 .",
    "note that as @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "we consider two scenarios to account for the power consumption at the receiver . in the first one , we assume a total processing power budget . denoting the power consumption of the lna , phase shifter , combiner , mixer and adc by @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively ,",
    "the total power consumption @xmath37 of analog and digital combining in terms of @xmath4 are respectively given by @xmath38 and @xmath39    we assume that the power consumption of the lna , phase shifter , combiner , and mixer are independent of the bandwidth .",
    "the power dissipation of adc scales linearly in sampling rate and exponentially in the number of bits per sample @xcite . assuming sampling at the nyquist rate , the figure of merit of adc power consumption is modeled as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is sampling rate ( bandwidth )",
    ", @xmath7 is the number of quantization bins of adc , and @xmath42 is the energy consumption per conversion step , e.g. @xmath43 fj @xcite .    in the second scenario",
    ", we only put a constraint on the total power used by all the adcs in the receiver .",
    "while this helps avoid comparing power consumption of different components ( which are designed using possibly different technologies ) , the analysis may only give a partial indication of what could happen in practice .",
    "in order to illustrate the accuracy of the aqnm , we consider a simple siso system , i.e. , @xmath44 , with fixed complex channel gain @xmath45 . we compare the rate achieved by gaussian inputs in the aqnm with the capacity computed for the 2 , 4 , and 8-bin quantizers @xcite .",
    "using the aqnm in ( [ eq0 ] ) , the equivalent received signal after the quantizer can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "then , the following rate is achievable when operating over a bandwidth @xmath41 : @xmath48 note that the rate given in ( [ ch1 ] ) is monotonically increasing and concave function of @xmath6 for a given bandwidth and resolution .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the rate in ( [ ch1 ] ) lower bounds the capacity . at low snrs the gap between the capacity and the rate under the aqnm is small , and as the quantization resolution increases the gap decreases .",
    "for example , at @xmath49db snr , the rate assuming aqnm is @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the capacity for @xmath52-bin and @xmath53-bin quantization , respectively . however , at high snr , the gap between the capacity and the rate of the aqnm increases .",
    "for example , at @xmath54db snr , the rate under the aqnm is @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the capacity for @xmath52-bin and @xmath53-bin quantization , respectively . in this regime ,",
    "the rate achieved by an equiprobable @xmath7 point input distribution is close to the capacity which can be approximated by @xmath57 bits / s @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the high snr regime the rate in ( [ ch1 ] ) can be approximated by @xmath58 , or @xmath59 , bits / s .",
    "therefore , the gap between the capacity and the rate under the aqnm becomes @xmath60 , or @xmath61 as snr increases .",
    "however , based on the fact that the capacity and the achievable rate under the aqnm show similar trends , we believe that the conclusions obtained in this paper would be valid when optimal input distribution is used , even though the actual numerical values of optimal bandwidth , resolution etc",
    ". may be slightly different .",
    "in order to get insights on the bandwidth usage and optimal resolution of adcs , in this section we limit our investigation to the siso channel . as in section  [ accuray ] , we assume the channel gain is constant and we investigate how the achievable rate in ( [ ch1 ] ) can be maximized by optimally choosing the bandwidth @xmath41 and the number of quantization bins @xmath7 under a total receiver power @xmath37 constraint . for @xmath37 , we follow the model in ( [ pow2 ] ) . the optimal bandwidth and resolution",
    "can be computed by the following optimization problem .",
    "[ ppp:4 ] @xmath62    [ lemma1 ] for the optimization problem in ( [ ppp:4 ] ) when @xmath2 is large , there exists an optimal bandwidth beyond which the achievable rate in ( [ ppp:4a ] ) starts decreasing .    since the rate in ( [ ch1 ] ) is monotonically increasing function of @xmath7 , the constraint in ( [ ppp:4b ] ) must be satisfied with equality .",
    "therefore , from ( [ ppp:4b ] ) we can argue that @xmath7 is equal to @xmath63 .",
    "accordingly , the optimization problem in ( [ ppp:4 ] ) can be reformulated as follows : @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "here we assume @xmath66 .",
    "the objective function in ( [ eq5a ] ) is a concave function of @xmath41 when @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath29 .",
    "we can argue that as @xmath69 , the objective function in ( [ eq5a ] ) goes to 0 , as @xmath70 the objective function in ( [ eq5a ] ) goes to @xmath71 .",
    "in addition , the objective function in ( [ eq5a ] ) is positive when @xmath72 .",
    "therefore we can conclude that when @xmath73 , there exists an optimal finite bandwidth @xmath74 for which rate in ( [ ppp:4 ] ) is maximized .",
    "lemma [ lemma1 ] shows that while for awgn channels ( even for those whose outputs are quantized ) the capacity increases as the bandwidth gets larger , under receiver power constraints , this is no longer the case .",
    "this suggests that even though the bandwidth is abundant in mmwave systems , since adc is power hungry , it may not be desirable to operate the system over its full bandwidth . similarly , there exits an optimal number of quantization levels that maximizes capacity under receiver power constraints .",
    "in order to show the effect of snr on the optimal bandwidth and the number of quantization bins , we set @xmath75 mw and the energy consumption per conversion step @xmath43 fj @xcite .",
    "the total bandwidth is @xmath76 ghz @xcite .",
    "we consider scalar non - uniform mmse quantizer at the adc and compute @xmath26 using lloyd - max algorithm @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , in the low snr regime it is optimal to use a lower bandwidth and larger number of quantization bins .",
    "this allows the transmitter to spread the available power over a smaller band and increase effective snr . here",
    ", snr refers to the received snr at the full bandwidth @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath77 . note that beyond 5db snr , the optimal resolution and bandwidth are @xmath78 and @xmath79 ghz , which is slightly less than the total available bandwidth 7 ghz .",
    "in this section , we investigate the achievable rate for the mimo system with digital and analog combining . for both receiver architectures we consider two scenarios : i ) perfect channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) where instantaneous channel realizations are known at the transmitter ; ii ) no csit , where the transmitter only knows the channel state .      using aqnm",
    ", we can obtain the equivalent channel per frequency band as follows : @xmath80 where @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 is the noise covariance matrix and @xmath83 is the input covariance matrix .",
    "then , the following rate is achievable with digital combining operating over a bandwidth @xmath84 : @xmath85.\\ ] ] since we consider independent identically distributed fading across antennas and frequency bands , the optimal input covariance matrix under no csit is @xmath86 @xcite .    under csit , since the input covariance matrix appears as noise in ( [ eq17 ] ) , using singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the channel matrix for @xmath83 does not immediately convert the mimo channel into multiple parallel channels .",
    "however , in this section for ease of implementation we use the svd of the channel matrix to determine @xmath83 which provides a further lower bound to the achievable rate .",
    "we also assume constant power allocation across frequency bands .",
    "then , denoting svd of @xmath87 by @xmath88 , we can rewrite ( [ eq20 ] ) as @xmath89 using the transmit beamforming matrix @xmath90 and the digital combining matrix @xmath91 , we obtain the received signal as @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . here",

    "@xmath101 denotes the diagonal matrix that contains the power levels .",
    "note that the above waterfilling strategy would be optimal in the case of no quantization , where the power dependent quantization noise term is zero .",

    "therefore , the achievable rate is maximized when the term @xmath110 is maximized .",
    "the maximum value that can be obtained depends of the availability of csit .      since there is no csit and the channel is symmetric , the optimal transmit beamforming vector is @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "we the have @xcite @xmath113 where @xmath114 is phase of the @xmath115th element of @xmath104 .",
    "the inequality above holds with equality when @xmath114 is chosen as the phase of @xmath116 plus @xmath117 .      at the transmitter digital beamforming in the form of maximum ratio transmission maximizes the received power . for a given analog combining vector @xmath104",
    "we have @xmath118 .",
    "note that the normalization is due to the power constraint at the transmitter , where , as in section  [ mimo_dig ] we assume no power allocation across frequency bands .",
    "then , we have @xmath119 .",
    "in this section , we provide numerical results to show the effects of adc bandwidth and resolution , the number of antennas , receiver architecture and power consumption on the achievable rate .",
    "we consider scalar non - uniform mmse quantizer at each adc and compute @xmath26 using llyod - max algorithm @xcite .",
    "we set the energy consumption per conversion step @xmath42 to @xmath120 fj @xcite .",

    "all results are obtained under independent rayleigh fading across space and frequency .",
    "we first consider only the total adc power consumption which is set to 20 mw .",
    "hence for analog combining @xmath123 mw while for digital @xmath124 mw .",
    "we examine the effect of snr on the rates of @xmath125 simo , and @xmath126 mimo systems with and without csit for analog and digital combining as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the figure includes achievable rates for only the best resolution levels .",
    "note that performances of the simo and the mimo systems with no csit are the same for analog combining .",
    "we observe that the optimal resolution is 3-bin quantization for all scenarios investigated except for simo with digital combining for which 2-bin quantization optimal .",
    "as shown in the figure , analog combining achieves higher rates than digital combining for all the cases studied even though the mimo system with digital combining has the advantage of spatial multiplexing .",
    "the benefit of spatial multiplexing can be seen from the gap between the rates of the simo and mimo systems with digital combining .",
    "however , mimo system with digital combining utilizes one - third ( @xmath127 ) of the bandwidth used by the analog combining architecture .",
    "this is due to fact that the total adc power budget in the case of digital combining is shared among antennas lowering the bandwidth usage . for the scenario investigated ,",

    "<S> the wide bandwidth and large number of antennas used in millimeter wave systems put a heavy burden on the power consumption at the receiver . in this paper , using an additive quantization noise model , the effect of analog - digital conversion ( adc ) resolution and bandwidth on the achievable rate is investigated for a multi - antenna system under a receiver power constraint . </S>",
    "<S> two receiver architectures , analog and digital combining , are compared in terms of performance . </S>",
    "<S> results demonstrate that : ( i ) for both analog and digital combining , there is a maximum bandwidth beyond which the achievable rate decreases ; ( ii ) depending on the operating regime of the system , analog combiner may have higher rate but digital combining uses less bandwidth when only adc power consumption is considered , ( iii ) digital combining may have higher rate when power consumption of all the components in the receiver front - end are taken into account . </S>"
