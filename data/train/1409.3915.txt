    "in statistical mechanics , non - trivial models have been extensively studied after the exact solution of the two dimensional ising model onsager1944 .",
    "a lot of authors have devoted an extensive use of several methods to describe the theory of magnetic systems by studying generalizations of such model , with more complex and richer phase diagrams . among these models ,",
    "one that deserves special attention is the z(@xmath5 ) model whereas , differently of ising model whose spin variable can assume only two values , each spin can assume @xmath5 values and more than one coupling constant for @xmath6 .",
    "this leads to more delicate aspects with phase diagram that is not completely understood yet , even for example , for small values of @xmath5 such as @xmath7 .",
    "the two - dimensional z(@xmath5 ) model contains several known systems as particular cases , for instance , the ising @xmath8 and _ xy _ @xmath9 models , as well as , the @xmath5-state scalar and vector potts ( clock ) models , and the ashkin - teller model @xmath10 . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the phase diagram possesses a traditional second - order phase transition , and for @xmath12 , it exhibits a kosterlitz - thouless type ( kt ) phase transition kosterlitz1973 .",
    "but , for what @xmath5 value does this last phase transition appear ? several works report that the kt phase transition appears at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the z(5 ) model exhibits a rich phase diagram with first - order transitions , including the 5-state potts point @xcite , two second - order transitions of the ising type at fateev - zamolodchikov ( fz ) integrability points fateev1982 , and two lines of infinite - order transitions ( dual to each other ) of the kt type jose1977,alcaraz1981,nijs1985,bonnier1989,bonnier1990,bonnier1991 ( see dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "several works assert that the fz points , henceforth named as bifurcation point , coincide with the points where the kt transitions are originated fateev1982,bonnier1990,alcaraz1986,alcaraz1987,bonnier1991a .",
    "so , this interesting model and , in special the bifurcation points ( for @xmath7 ) , deserves further explorations and non - equilibrium analysis can be an interesting alternative to obtain not only the static critical exponents but also the dynamical ones which have not yet been obtained in previous contributions .",
    "moreover , this approach has proved to be efficient in determining the critical parameters of several models as shown in recent works ( see for example the refs .",
    "silvapre2013,silvacpc2013,silvapre2012 ) .    in this paper , we present results from the study of the critical properties of the isotropic ferromagnetic two - dimensional spin model with z(5 ) symmetry , hereafter denoted as z(5 ) model , by using time - dependent mc simulations .",
    "as we are dealing with a symmetric model , the two bifurcation points are also symmetric and possess the same set of critical exponents .",
    "hence , we concentrated in only one of them .",
    "our contributions are divided in four parts as follows :    1 .",
    "we estimated the critical parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the bifurcation point @xcite by using  a simple refinement method , in the context of time - dependent mc simulations which searches the best power law time decay of magnetization , as proposed in ref .",
    "silvapre2012 ; 2 .",
    "we obtained the dynamic critical exponent @xmath15 and the static critical exponents @xmath16 and @xmath1 of the two independent order parameters of the model for the bifurcation point ; 3 .",
    "we explored several points on the self - dual line of the model by estimating the exponents of its two order parameters .",
    "we showed that the exponents are different along this line but respect a peculiar symmetry .",
    "however , for the particular point corresponding to the 5-state potts model the critical exponents assume the same value ; 4 .   we also explored and obtained some estimates of weak first - order points on the self - dual line and other second - order points on the soft - disorder transition line using an heuristic method , developed in this paper , that takes into account the second moment of the order parameters .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model and briefly discuss some peculiarities of its phase diagram . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we present some finite size scaling relations in non - equilibrium spin systems theory and describe the power laws which are considered in this work to measure the required exponents and parameters .",
    "we also show how to simulate such behaviors via time - dependent monte carlo simulations .",
    "our results are divided in two sections : in section section : resultsi , we determined estimates of the phase transition points in the phase diagram by using a non - equilibrium approach and in section section : resultsii we specifically showed some estimates of critical exponents along the self - dual line with special attention to the fz point .",
    "finally , in section [ section4 ] we summarize and conclude our work .",
    "in this article we have studied the dynamic critical behavior of the z(5 ) model by using short - time monte carlo simulations .",
    "the most general hamiltonian of this model is given by @xmath17   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + k_{2}\\left [ \\cos \\left ( \\frac{4\\pi } { 5}(n_{i}-n_{j})\\right ) -1\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath18 indicates that the spin variables interact only with their nearest neighbors , @xmath19 and @xmath20 label the sites of a two - dimensional lattice of size @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the two positive coupling constants , and @xmath24 label the degrees of freedom of each site of the lattice .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ( according to ref .",

    "it is interesting to observe that 5-state potts point corresponds to the meeting between the self - dual line defined by @xmath29 and the potts physical line @xmath30 , this last one being a symmetry line of the diagram .    in this work",
    "we are more concerned with the bifurcation point .",
    "actually , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] the model has two bifurcation points ( fz points ) localized on the self - dual line . the phase transition line between the fz points ( which includes the potts point ) is of weak first order , and that on the right(left ) of the rightmost(leftmost ) fz point , there are two continuous transition lines between ordered - soft and disordered - soft phases .",
    "however the two bifurcation points are symmetric to each other and have the same set of critical exponents .",
    "for this reason , we took into account only one of them .",
    "the ratio of the coupling constants for the bifurcation point is given by @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , there are four order parameters but only two of them are independent ones @xcite , namely @xmath32and @xmath33where @xmath34 is the kronecker s delta .",
    "since we established the main details of the model in order to calculate the critical parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as well as the critical exponents @xmath35 , @xmath1 , and @xmath16 , we present in the next section the finite size scaling developed to describe non - equilibrium spin systems , the time - dependent power laws obtained from this approach , and some details about time - dependent mc simulations to be applied .",
    "until a few years ago , the numerical calculation of critical exponents was carried out only in equilibrium . unfortunately , in this stage , the measurements of such exponents are very hard due to severe _",
    "critical slowing down _ which takes place in the vicinity of the critical temperature . to circumvent this difficulty ,",
    "some algorithms were proposed , for instance , the cluster algorithm @xcite that , although it is very efficient in the study of static properties , it violates the dynamic universality class of the specific local dynamics , such as the model a.    another way to avoid problems with the _ critical slowing down _ was proposed by janssen , schaub and schmittmann @xcite and huse huse1989 , both in 1989 .",
    "they discovered using renormalization group techniques and numerical calculations , respectively , that there is universality and scaling behavior far from equilibrium .",
    "since then , the so - called short - time regime has become an important method for the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena .    the dynamic scaling relation obtained by janssen _",
    "k_-th moment of the order parameter , extended to systems of finite size @xcite , is written as @xmath36where @xmath37 is the time evolution , @xmath38 is an arbitrary spatial rescaling factor , @xmath39 is the reduced temperature and @xmath40 is the linear size of the lattice . the exponents @xmath1 and @xmath16 are the equilibrium critical exponents associated with the order parameter and the correlation length , and @xmath15 is the dynamic exponent characterizing temporal correlations in equilibrium .",
    "here , the operator @xmath41 denotes averages over different configurations due to different possible time evolution from each initial condition of a given initial magnetization @xmath42 . for a large lattice size @xmath43 and small initial magnetization @xmath42 at the critical temperature @xmath44 , the eq .",
    "( eq1 ) is governed by the new dynamic exponent @xmath45 , according to @xmath46if we choose the scaling factor @xmath47 .",
    "this new exponent characterizes the so - called _ critical initial slip _ , the anomalous behavior of the order parameter when the system is quenched to the critical temperature @xmath48 .",
    "besides , a new critical exponent @xmath49 , which represents the anomalous dimension of the initial magnetization @xmath42 , is introduced to describe the dependence of the scaling behavior on the initial conditions .",
    "this exponent is related to @xmath45 as @xmath50 .",
    "actually the relaxation of spin systems is determined by two different behaviors , this initial slip and a second behavior corresponding to a power - law decay .",
    "this can be derived from the eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . after the scaling @xmath51 at the critical temperature @xmath52 @xmath53 ,",

    "the separability of the variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath67 leads to@xmath68where the prime means the derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "since the left - hand side of this equation depends only on @xmath66 and the right - hand side depends only on @xmath65 , both sides must be equal to a constant @xmath69 .",
    "thus , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , resulting in @xmath72 .",
    "returning to the original variables , one has @xmath73 .    on one hand , by choosing @xmath74 at criticality ( @xmath75 ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath76 , where @xmath77 that corresponds to a regime of small initial magnetization soon after a finite time scaling @xmath47 in eq .",
    "this leads to @xmath78 . by calling @xmath79 , an expansion of the averaged magnetization around @xmath80 results in @xmath81 . by construction @xmath82 and , since @xmath83 , we can discard quadratic terms resulting in @xmath84 .",
    "this anomalous behavior of initial magnetization is valid only for a characteristic time scale @xmath85 @xmath86 .    on the other hand",
    ", the choice @xmath87 corresponds to the case where the system does not depend on the initial trace and @xmath88 leads to simple power law : @xmath89that similarly corresponds to the decay of magnetization ( for @xmath90 ) of a system previously evolved from an initial small magnetization @xmath91 , and that had its magnetization increased according to eq .",

    "many authors have obtained the dynamic exponent @xmath15 as well as the static ones @xmath1 and @xmath16 , for many different models ( see , for example , two good reviews can be found in refs .",

    "as we are dealing with a rich phase diagram , a careful analysis of the order of the phase transition is necessary , mainly when taking into account first - order critical  points . as pointed out earlier , the phase diagram of the z(5 ) model possesses two second - order phase transition points which coincide with the fz integrability points , as well as two lines of infinite - order transition ( dual to each other ) also known as self - dual lines .",
    "the phase transitions of the points on these lines which extend from the 5-state potts point to the fz points are expected to be of first - order . although it is not expected a power law behavior of the order parameter at strong first - order points , it is possible to obtain this behavior for weak first - order ones , whereas for @xmath131 a disorder metastable state vanishes at a certain @xmath132 and , for @xmath133 , there is an ordered metastable state which disappears at @xmath134 .",
    "both parameter values look like critical points if the system remains in the disordered or ordered metastable states , and so in both points a power law behavior must be observed as studied by schulke and zheng @xcite through the analysis of the weakness of first - order phase transition in the @xmath135-state potts model . in that case a good estimate for @xmath136 would be @xmath137 . for the 5-state potts model , for example , the difference between the pseudo critical points @xmath132 or @xmath134 and @xmath136 is in the fourth decimal digit .",
