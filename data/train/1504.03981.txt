    "the algebraic and topological techniques in dynamical systems have played a significant role as can be verified , for example , in morse theory and more recently in conley s index theory .",
    "this theory was introduced by c.conley in the late seventies and has been further developed in a variety of contexts .",
    "initially defined for continuous dynamical systems on compact sets , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and later for discrete dynamical systems .",
    "the conley index was originally defined for isolated invariant sets @xmath0 of continuous flows and defined to be the homotopy type of the pointed space obtained from a filtration pair associated to @xmath0 .",
    "it was then proven that the conley index is independent of the choice of the filtration pair and is a homotopy invariant .",
    "this is precisely the difficulty in the discrete case since there are examples where the homotopy type of the filtration pair of @xmath0 may depend on the choice of the pair .    motivated by this difficulty several definitions were presented for the discrete case .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the version we adopt herein is due to richeson @xcite and called the * reduced homological conley index*. the reason behind this choice is twofold : firstly it is computationally easier to work with and secondly , it is the form used in the definition of connection matrix pairs .",
    "this index will be defined more precisely in section  [ background ] .",

    "the map @xmath6 is the homology induced map of the pointed space map @xmath7 associated to the filtration pair @xmath8 .",
    "the conley index has the crucial property of continuation which guarantees the invariance of the index under small @xmath9 perturbations of the system .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the continuation property together with the fact that fitted diffeomorphisms are @xmath9-dense on the set of diffeomorphisms on closed manifolds , see @xcite , motivated our investigation of the discrete conley index for zero dimensional basic sets .    in this article ,",
    "our main result theorem [ theo1 ] establishes a relation between a homological invariant , namely the conley index , and a dynamical invariant obtained from the structure matrix of a zero dimensional basic set .",
    "we then proceed to characterize the isomorphism of the conley index of a zero dimensional basic set by using the real jordan form of its structure matrix , theorem [ theo2 ] .",
    "furthermore , by using theorem [ theo1 ] , we obtain an alternative formulation for the results on the homology zeta function and on morse inequalities of diffeomorphisms with hyperbolic chain recurrents sets on closed manifolds found in @xcite .",
