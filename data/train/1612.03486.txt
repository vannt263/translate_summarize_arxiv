    "in the papers @xcite , the autors initiated the study of groups @xmath1 , describing the behaviour of dynamical systems of @xmath2 particles governed by a certain general position codimension @xmath3 property with respect to @xmath4-tuples of particles .",
    "the main examples coming from this theory are homomorphisms from the @xmath2-strand pure braid group to the groups @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that the standard artin presentation can also be described as a modification of such a standard presentation of ( some subgroup of ) @xmath7 .",
    "stadard presentations of groups @xmath1 have a nice property : each letter in each word of this presentation has lots of `` invariants '' : when applying each of the relations we either get a bijection between similar letters ( in this case the corresponding letters have the same invariants ) , or we get a cancellation of two letters ( in this case these two letters have the same values of the invariant ) .",
    "this leads to two obvious invariants .",
    "first , for a given word @xmath8 from @xmath1 and for each generator @xmath9 in @xmath8 we get ` indices' @xmath10 valued in the free product of @xmath11 copies of the group @xmath12 for each @xmath13 ; roughly speaking , we get an invariant by counting the number of generators @xmath14 , which occur before @xmath9 in the word @xmath8 , for each @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    on the other hand , by using these indices one can construct a homomorphism from the group @xmath1 to a free product of the groups @xmath12 . the non - triviality of the image for this homomorphism can be easily checked and provides a sufficient conditon for the initial braid to be non - trivial . in the present paper , by using a simple intutive construction we show how to associatie with any word in artin s generator a certain word in a larger set of generators containing the initial word inside ( theorem  [ homo_tildegn3 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "we get a phenomenon of _ imaginary generators _ which allows one to _ read between letters _ : for a word in letters @xmath18 we can `` see '' the letters @xmath19 , placed between @xmath18 , so tat the equivalence of the initial words in @xmath18 leads to the equivalence of the resulting words in @xmath20 , see definiton [ relations ] . in the algebraic language",
    "this is described by means of an injection of a smaller group to a larger one ; the compostion of this homomorphism with the obvious projection is the identity homomorphism .",
    "this allows one to use the larger group ( a small modificaton of the group @xmath5 ) as a modification of the small group ( actualy , the braid group ) ; which makes it possible to use @xmath5 for constructing invariants of crossings of a classical braid : with each classical crossing we associate a set of invarians which do not change under the third reidemeister move ; if we apply the second reidemeister move , the crossings which can cancel have the same invariants .",
    "this allows us to `` foresee '' that some two crossings of a classical braid can not be cancelled . in section 2",
    ", we shall define the group @xmath21 , which appears when we splice `` classical braid generators '' into the group @xmath5 . in the setion 3",
    ", we construct a new invariant of pure braids by using @xmath21 by means of a homomorphism from @xmath5 to the free product of some copies of the group @xmath12 ( these homomorphisms lead to evident composite homomorphisms from @xmath21 to the free product mentioned above ) . in secton 4 , we get a sufficient condition for two adjacent generators @xmath22 and @xmath23 not to cancel . in the present paper , we do not pretend to consturct necessary and suficient condition for cancellability ; we just give some striking examles when this cancellability is impossible .    in the end of the paper ,",
    "we give a list of unsolved problems and topics for future discussion .",

    "if a point passes to triple point , which contains the infinite point ( @xmath72 ) , then it is possible to give an additional information and write one of generators not of @xmath73 , but of @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
