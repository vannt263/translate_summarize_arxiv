    "the welcher weg problem appears to have been suggested by the _ feynman lectures on physics_. in chapter 1 of part iii of these lectures @xcite , feynman prepares his undergraduate audience for the shock of quantum mechanics by discussing two double - slit gedankenexperiments with electrons .",
    "the first experiment is the standard one ; an interference pattern is gradually built up as electrons strike the detection screen . in the second experiment , ` which way ' an electron takes",
    "is determined by shining a light beam on it at the slits .",
    "the pattern that builds up now no longer shows interference .",
    "the loss of interference is explained by the uncertainty principle .",
    "feynman goes on to affirm that `` no one has ever found ( or even thought of ) a way around the uncertainty principle '' .",
    "however , in 1991 scully , englert and walther ( hereafter sew ) claimed that ``  we have found a way around this position - momentum uncertainty obstacle  that is , we have found a way  to obtain which - path or particle - like information without scattering or otherwise introducing large uncontrolled phase factors into the interfering beams . ''",
    "they went on to state that , in their gedankenexperiment , `` the principle of complementarity is manifest although the position - momentum uncertainty relation plays no role '' @xcite .",
    "the way around that sew had found consisted of using cold atoms as particles in a one - particle interference experiment . an excited atom ( travelling at a low speed )",
    "may be induced to emit a photon in a resonant cavity in its path",
    ". if the parameters are right , emission of the photon will have a negligible effect on the atom s linear momentum , and therefore on its de broglie wavelength ; the effect on the interference pattern should be negligible . at the same time , the emitted photon will reveal which path the atom took .    in 1998 ,",
    "drr , nonn and rempe ( hereafter dnr ) performed the actual experiment @xcite ( now regarded as definitive ) which , as we shall see , differed from the one suggested by sew in some essential aspects .",
    "their findings agreed with the expectations of sew ; the mere possibility of detection of the path taken by an atom resulted in the loss of interference , and the effect could not be explained by an appeal to the position - momentum uncertainty relation .",
    "the title that dnr gave to their paper was `` origin of quantum - mechanical complementarity probed by a ` which - way ' experiment in an atom interferometer '' .",
    "the chief aim of the present paper is to provide an explanation of the phenomena observed by dnr that is based on the theory of ray representations of the inhomogeneous galilei group .",
    "this theory can describe atoms in different energy levels , but there is an unexpected subtlety .",
    "the explanation , which also predicts phenomena that can not be accounted for by the dnr model , is quite independent of any notion of complementarity . additionally , two new experiments are suggested ; one of them , fittingly called the _ own - goal experiment _ , may refute the proposed explanation quite decisively .",
    "the other may discriminate between the dnr explanation and the one offered here .",
    "the plan of the work is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - sew ] we review , briefly , the gedankenexperiment of sew . in sec .",
    "[ sec - dnr ] we review the experiment of dnr .",
    "this is followed by sec .",
    "[ sec - main ] , the main section of this paper . in it",
    "we use the theory of ray representations of the galilei group to explain the experimental results of dnr without using any notion of complementarity . in sec .",
    "[ sec - discuss ] , we compare our explanation with that of dnr , which is modelled on a moving two - level atom",
    ". the new experiments are suggested in sec .",
    "[ sec - expts ] , the last section of the paper .",
    "the first , discussed in [ subsec - own - goal ] , is the own - goal experiment that may decisively refute the explanation based on galilei invariance .",
    "the second is a variant of the dnr experiment , and includes a quantum eraser which may enable it to distinguish between the gaillei invariance and the dnr explanations .",
    "there are two appendices . in the first ,",
    "we collect together the key definitions and formulae of the theory of ray representations , and recapitulate the notion of unitary equivalence for these representations . in the second , we provide some references to ( i )  quantum optics and the manipulation of particles by light , and ( ii )  complementarity and uncertainty , subjects which form the experimental and theoretical backdrops to this paper .",

    "[ fig - sew ] .",
    "the two cavities , each tuned to resonate at 21 ghz and prepared in the zero - photon state , together constitute the which - way detector .",

    "most of the energy difference has therefore to be attributed to the internal energy .",
    "however , as the internal energy is constant in an irreducible representation , this implies that interaction with the interferometer with which - way detector _ splits the representation of the incoming wave into a direct sum of two different irreducibles _ , which differ in their internal energies by the energy difference of the two atomic levels .",
    "we shall condense this into a proposition :    [ prop - key ] let the incoming particle be in a state @xmath107 .",

    "gedankenexperiment , loss of interference was a statistical phenomenon due to the uncertainty principle ; by contrast , loss of interference due to the orthogonality ( [ eq - ip ] ) may be called a _",
    "dynamical _ phenomenon .",
    "the fundamental difference between the explanations offered by sew , on the one hand , and dnr and galilei invariance , on the other hand is the following . in the former ,",
    "there is no interference because the two states of the which - way detector  which is physically distinct from the atom  are orthogonal ; in the latter , there is no interference because the _ two states of the atom _ are orthogonal . at first sight",
    "it might appear that the dnr explanation is just the galilei invariance explanation pared down to the essentials : a moving two - level atom .",

    "the two experiments suggested below may discriminate between the various explanations of the results of which - way experiments in atom interferometry .",
    "the setup is the same as that shown in fig .",

    "there is only one cavity ; cavity 2 is not present .",
    "cavity 1 is prepared in a coherent state , so that an atom entering it will decay with probability 1 .",
    "condition 2 above means that which - way information can not be obtained in this experiment ; the addition of extra photons should make no detectable difference to a cavity prepared in a coherent state .",
    "if interference is not observed under this arrangement , it would support the galilei invariance argument , and throw doubt on the sew version of complementarity .",
    "if , however , interference _ is _ observed , then it would decisively _ refute _ the galilei invariance argument .",
    "suppose that the own - goal experiment has been performed , and that its result supports the galilei invariance explanation .",

    "the experiment will consist of looking for interference in the pair d , e. then : , or that of d to @xmath19 . ]",
    "if interference is _ not _ observed , it would be additional support for the galilei invariance argument ( as opposed to the two - level atom argument ) : the direct sum of two copies of the same representation _ has not collapsed _ into a single irreducible representation .",

    "is _ observed , it would mean either that ( a )  the galilei invariance argument is valid , but the two component representations have collapsed into one ; or that ( b )  the galilei invariance argument is invalid .    in the opinion of the present author , observation of interference in this experiment will have significant theoretical implications , but it would be premature to speculate .",

    "the following collection of definitions and formulae is tailored to our needs .",

    "a complete mathematical account will be found in bargmann s original paper @xcite .",
    "following wigner and bargmann , we shall denote operator rays by boldface symbols : an operator ray is a collection @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is any operator on @xmath126 .",
    "an operator @xmath127 is a _ representative _ of the ray .",
    "operator rays can be multiplied , and a family of operator rays @xmath128 is said to form a _ ray representation _ of the group @xmath38 if @xmath129 as rays can not be added , it would be more convenient to work with operators .",
    "bargmann showed how this could be done without sacrificing generality .",
    "if @xmath130 are representatives of @xmath131 respectively , then one must have @xmath132 where @xmath133 is a complex number of modulus unity .",
    "it has to satisfy the condition @xmath134    which follows from the associativity of multiplication in @xmath38 , and the condition @xmath135 which follows from @xmath136 .",
    "a continuous complex - valued function of modulus unity on @xmath137 that satisfies ( [ factor - cond-1 ] ) and ( [ factor - cond-2 ] ) is called a _ factor system _ of @xmath38",
    ". equations ( [ rr - to - tr ] ) , ( [ factor - cond-1 ] ) and ( [ factor - cond-2 ] ) are the defining relations of ray representations in terms of operators .",
    "let @xmath138 be a continuous complex - valued function of modulus unity on @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath139 is a representative of the ray @xmath140 , then so is @xmath141 if the @xmath139 satisfy ( [ rr - to - tr ] ) , then the @xmath142 satisfy @xmath143 where @xmath144    both ( [ rr - to - tr ] ) and ( [ rr - to - tr-2 ] ) describe operator multiplication in the same ray representation ( [ def - rr ] ) of @xmath38 .",
    "we therefore define two factor systems @xmath133 and @xmath145 to be _ equivalent _ if there exists a continuous complex - valued function @xmath138 of modulus unity on @xmath38 such that ( [ equiv - fs ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it is easily verified that this is a true equivalence relation .",
    "it partitions the set of factor systems of @xmath38 into equivalence classes .",
    "the main problem of the theory of ray representations is to determine the set of equivalence classes of factor systems of @xmath38 .",
    "a factor system @xmath146 may be written as @xmath147 where @xmath148 is a real - valued function on @xmath137 , called a _",
    "group exponent_.    a ray representation may be specified by a set of operator representatives and an equivalence class of factor systems .",
    "we shall write the pair as @xmath149 .    the factor system @xmath146 is said to be _ equivalent to unity _ if there exists a @xmath138 such that @xmath150 . in this case",
    "the ray representation is equivalent to a true representation .",
    "let @xmath38 be a group that admits a nontrivial factor system , and let @xmath149 and @xmath151 be two ray representations of @xmath38 : @xmath152 { d^{\\prime}}(g_1){d^{\\prime}}(g_2)&= & { { \\omega^{\\prime}}(g_1,g_2)}{d^{\\prime}}(g_1g_2)\\label{eq - prime } \\ ] ]    the factor systems @xmath153 , and therefore the representations @xmath154 , are equivalent if there exists a continuous function @xmath155 on @xmath38 such that ( [ equiv - fs ] ) is satisfied .",
    "next , let @xmath54 be a unitary operator and @xmath156 a continuous real - valued function with @xmath157 such that @xmath158    multiplying ( [ eq - ord ] ) by @xmath54 from the left and @xmath159 on the right , using ( [ proj - equiv-1 ] ) , setting @xmath160 and using ( [ equiv - fs ] ) , we recover ( [ eq - prime ] ) .",
    "this shows that the unitary transformation @xmath54 transforms the representation @xmath149 into the representation @xmath161 .",
    "the two ray representations are equivalent ; their operator representatives can be transformed into each other by a unitary transformation , but the representative of a transformed operator ray has to be chosen in accordance with ( [ proj - equiv-1 ] ) .",
    "the equivalence ( [ proj - equiv-1 ] ) has been called _ projective equivalence _ by lvy - leblond @xcite .",
    "for a recent introduction to quantum optics , see the textbook by fox @xcite .",
    "the monograph by haroche and raimond @xcite gives more detailed accounts of the topics they cover .",
    "jaeger , shimony and vaidman @xcite , and independently , englert @xcite have obtained a duality relation between path determination and fringe visibility in interferometry without using any robertson - heisenberg inequality derived from a pair of noncommuting self - adjoint operators .",
    "it was suggested , on this basis , that `` the duality relation is logically independent of the uncertainty relation '' @xcite .",
    "this suggestion was controverted by drr and rempe , who derived the duality relation from the robertson - heisenberg uncertainty relation for a suitably - chosen pair of self - adjoint operators @xcite .",
    "it should , however , be recalled that spectral theorems , going back to hilbert and von neumann , ensure that for any subset @xmath162 of real numbers , there exist an infinity of self - adjoint operators that have @xmath162 as their common spectrum , so that the construction of drr and rempe may be highly nonunique .",
    "an introduction to spectral theory  enough to justify the above statement  may be found in appendix  a6 of @xcite .    on the other hand , conditions other than the spectrum may inhibit certain quantities , such as time in quantum mechanics and the phase of a quantized electromagnetic field , from being described by self - adjoint operators .",
