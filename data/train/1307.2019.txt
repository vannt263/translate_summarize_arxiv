    "in the last decade , the motion and modeling of active particles has attracted much attention in the field of nonequilibrium physics @xcite .",
    "a major part of active particles are artificial colloidal microswimmers with fixed stable shapes @xcite , but there are also cases in which the particles are deformable and do change shape during their motion .",
    "such deformability is of basic importance for active droplets @xcite but is also relevant for living swimmers like protozoa and other microorganisms @xcite .",
    "therefore a basic theoretical description for active deformable self - propelled particles and microswimmers is needed .    in a quiescent solvent , dynamical equations of motion",
    "were recently put forward which couple the particle position and deformability @xcite .",
    "one of the unexpected results was a spontaneous circling motion due to the coupling of deformability and self - propulsion @xcite .",
    "however , in most practical situations @xcite , various external fields are present to influence the particle motion .",
    "they are , for instance , induced by a chemoattractant , phototaxis , and gravity @xcite , or external walls @xcite .",
    "an important particular case is a solvent flow field such as a couette flow with a constant shear gradient or a poiseuille flow through tubes .",
    "there are several studies of rigid self - propelled particles in various shear geometries @xcite .",
    "however , despite its practical relevance , the motion of a deformable self - propelled particle in a solvent flow has not been considered theoretically yet .",
    "the corresponding modeling is expected to be complex since already rigid ( undeformable ) active particles have been shown to perform periodic motion on cycloids ( rather than on straight lines ) once they are exposed to a linear shear flow field @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we close this gap and propose a theoretical model for the motion of an active deformable particle in shear flow .",
    "we use symmetry considerations in two spatial dimensions to obtain coupled nonlinear dynamical equations for the particle position , velocity , deformation , and its active rotations . in our model , a passive rotation induced by the shear flow and an active spinning motion are both taken into account . on the one hand , for vanishing shear flow , our equations reduce to previous models for deformable particles @xcite . on the other hand , for vanishing particle deformability , we obtain the cycloidal motion as embodied in previous investigations @xcite . for varied shear rate and particle propulsion speed ,",
    "we solve the equations numerically and obtain a manifold of different dynamical modes including active straight motion , periodic motions , regular and undulated cycloidal motions , winding motions , as well as quasi - periodic and chaotic motions induced at high shear rates .",
    "the types of motion are distinguished by different characteristics in the dynamical behavior of the particle positions , velocity orientations , and its deformations .",
    "we are not aware of any experiments of deformable active particles in shear flow , but in principle these experiments are conceivable building upon recent analysis of self - propelled droplets @xcite that can be subjected to an additional shear flow .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce time - evolution equations for an active deformable particle under an external flow . in sec .",
    "[ sec : solution without deformation in 2d ] , we consider the special case of a round disk - shaped non - deformable active particle by eliminating the variable for deformation .",
    "we relate this case to previous work @xcite .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : zeta=-0.1 ] , we present numerical results for the dynamics of a deformable active particle under steady shear flow . in sec .",
    "[ sec : zeta=1.5 ] , a spontaneous particle rotation for the dynamics is additionally included and numerical results are presented . finally , sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] is devoted to a summary and to conclusions .",
    "based on symmetry considerations , we now derive a set of coupled nonlinear dynamical equations to describe the motion of a deformable active particle under an externally imposed flow field .",
    "these equations are first listed for the general case of three spatial dimensions and an unspecified flow field .",
    "afterwards we will confine ourselves to a two - dimensional geometry and consider a simple shear flow . as a first approach ,",
    "we only investigate the influence of the shear flow on the particle dynamics and do not consider the inverse effect .    in the following , we denote the prescribed externally imposed flow field that the particle is exposed to as @xmath0 .",
    "it is a given function of space . to proceed as normal @xcite ,",
    "the elongational part of the fluid flow is extracted by the symmetric second - rank tensor @xmath1 with components @xmath2 similarly , the rotational part is extracted via the anti - symmetric second - rank tensor @xmath3 with components @xmath4    we denote the center - of - mass position of the particle at time @xmath5 as @xmath6 . in general , the total particle velocity @xmath7 has two contributions . on the one hand ,",
    "the particle is `` passively '' advected by the externally imposed prescribed flow field @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the particle can `` actively '' self - propel with respect to the surrounding fluid .",
    "the corresponding `` active '' velocity measured relatively to the surrounding fluid flow is denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "altogether , we obtain the equation of motion @xmath9 where the index @xmath10 labels the cartesian coordinates .    in our description ,",
    "the active velocity @xmath8 is one of our major dynamical variables describing the behavior of the particle .",
    "the other ones are its deformation that we characterize by the second - rank traceless symmetric tensor @xmath11 , and an `` active '' particle rotation described by the second - rank antisymmetric tensor @xmath12 .",
    "both of these tensors are briefly introduced in the following .    for simplicity , we only include elongational and flattening deformations of the particle .",
    "the tensor @xmath11 represents these deformations @xcite .",
    "we first consider the two - dimensional case , where orientations in the two - dimensional plane can be parameterized by a single angle @xmath13 .",
    "this angle @xmath13 is now used to measure directions from the particle center of mass . the distance from the particle center to its boundary in the direction @xmath13 at time @xmath5 is denoted as @xmath14 .",
    "large deformations are not taken into account , so that @xmath14 is single - valued with respect to the angle @xmath13 .    for a steady circular shape",
    "we have @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the particle radius .",
    "we now consider deviations @xmath17 from the circular shape , such that the distance from the particle center to its boundary becomes @xmath18 .",
    "next , the deviation from the circular shape @xmath17 is expanded into a fourier series @xmath19 in this expansion , the zeroth mode is excluded by assuming that the area of the particle is conserved .",
    "the first fourier mode would represent a translation of the center of mass , which we already took into account by the velocity variable @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the lowest mode describing deformations is the second one , which actually represents an elliptical deformation . in two dimensions",
    ", we can define a symmetric tensor as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where we have defined @xmath22 .",
    "so the searched - for tensor @xmath11 can be written in the form @xmath23 here , @xmath24 corresponds to the degree of deformation , and @xmath25 to the orientation of the long axis of deformation . @xmath26",

    "likewise , the minimum mode of the deformation , @xmath31 , represents an ellipsoidal deformation .",
    "see ref .   for the relations between @xmath32 and @xmath11 in three spatial dimensions .",
    "finally , our last dynamic variable @xmath12 characterizes an `` active '' rotational motion of the particle around its center of mass .",
    "we call this a spinning motion @xcite .",
    "this antisymmetric second - rank tensor @xmath12 can be obtained from the corresponding vector of angular velocity @xmath33 via @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the components of the levi - civita tensor .",
    "summation over repeated indices is implied , as throughout the remaining part of this paper .",

    "the anti - symmetric tensor @xmath12 represents the relative rotation with respect to the rotational motion @xmath3 of the surrounding fluid flow .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 describes the total angular velocity with respect to the laboratory frame from which the flow field is parameterized .    in total",
    ", we have introduced three central dynamical variables to characterize the state of a deformable active particle : @xmath8 for the active propulsion velocity , @xmath11 for the particle deformation , and @xmath12 for the active rotational motion .",

    "( [ eq : v])([eq : omega ] ) . in principle , more terms and higher - order couplings can be included , but the current model covers the main physical aspects that we intend to describe .",

    "likewise , this function characterizes the onset of the spontaneous rotation of the particle around its center of mass when @xmath43 becomes positive .",
    "together , the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath43 characterize the strength of activity , for self - propulsion and for active rotation , respectively .",
    "in contrast to that , an active deformation of the particle is not considered . the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) with @xmath60 always induces a relaxation of the deformation back to a spherical ( circular ) shape , at least when the coupling to @xmath8 , @xmath12 , and to the surrounding flow field @xmath0 allow it .",
    "next , we consider the terms with the coefficients @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) and @xmath47 in eq .  ( [ eq : s ] ) .",
    "they have similar origin and include reorientations of the particle velocity and elongation axes due to the shear flow and due to the active spinning motion . in the passive case",
    ", they would contain the advective reorientation of the particle axes due to the fluid flow .",
    "since an active particle can follow a prescribed rule on how to react to external rotational flow fields , the numerical values of the coefficients can not be generally fixed at this point .",

    "i.e.  an undeformable particle  of spherical or ellipsoidal shape , rotational and translational motions do not couple to each other to linear order @xcite .",

    "the most trivial state is represented by the turquoise filled pentagon symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1](a ) .",
    "they indicate a _ passive straight motion_. in the absence of any external flow field , a particle in this state is motionless and has a circular shape . when the shear flow is switched on , the particle is elongated due to the elongational contribution from the flow field",
    "nevertheless , its active self - propulsion velocity remains zero , @xmath120 , so that it is just passively advected with the flow field .",
    "we do not include plots of these trivial trajectories in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1 ] .",
    "next , a particle that moves straight in a condition without shear flow continues to move straight in the presence of shear flow at low shear rates @xmath68 .",
    "it features a time - independent steady state of deformation .",
    "such a situation is marked by the green open pentagons in the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1](a ) and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1](b ) for @xmath121 and @xmath122 . the real - space trajectory is only bended a little because the particle is advected in @xmath109-direction with the fluid flow that increases in the @xmath108-direction due to the shear geometry .",
    "since @xmath123 , we term this type of motion an _ active straight motion _ in this paper .",
    "we note from the line @xmath124 in the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1](a ) that with increasing shear rate @xmath68 a transition from passive to active straight motion can be induced .",
    "interestingly , the phase behavior is reentrant , and we again observe passive straight motion at very high shear rates .",
    "the reason for this behavior are shear - rate dependent deformations @xmath11 that are induced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) via the shear flow .",
    "they in turn couple to the relative velocity @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) and at intermediate shear rates induce active self - propulsion .",
    "if a particle undergoes a circular motion when the shear is absent , it exhibits what we call a _ cycloidal i motion _ under a small nonzero shear rate as indicated by the red open squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1](a ) . in this state , a particle moves on a cycloidal trajectory with @xmath123 and with its deformation axes rotating as depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1](c ) and ( d ) , both for @xmath125 and @xmath122",
    ". both , clockwise ( c ) and counter - clockwise ( d ) rotations are possible . whether clockwise or counter - clockwise",
    "rotation appears during the cycloidal i motion generally depends on the initial conditions . at higher shear rates close to the stability boundary of the cycloidal i motion , however , cycloidal i motion of counter - clockwise rotation becomes unstable first , before the one with clockwise rotation .",
    "this is because the rotational part of the shear flow is oriented in clockwise direction as well and breaks the rotational symmetry of space .",
    "however , the effect occurs within a thinner parameter region than the grid size in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1](a ) resolves .",
    "therefore we do not mark this region in the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1](a ) .",
    "so far , we have only discussed types of motion that result directly as a generalization of the types of motion found for vanishing flow field @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "quite contrarily , the following types of motion are qualitatively different and newly observed in the presence of the shear flow .",
    "when the cycloidal i motion has become unstable at high shear rates , the particle exhibits a _ winding i motion_. the corresponding narrow region in the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1](a ) is marked by the purple filled triangles .",
    "it is located between the cycloidal i motion and the active straight motion . for this winding i motion , the long axis of the particle does not make full rotations in the laboratory frame .",
    "it only oscillates in time around the velocity vector , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1](e ) for @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "in particular , the trajectories in @xmath25-@xmath87 space exhibit a closed loop indicating an oscillation .",
    "in contrast to the active straight motion , both , the relative velocity and the deformations of the particle , are time - dependent",
    ".    finally , at high shear rates , also the active straight motion becomes unstable , and a _ cycloidal ii motion _ appears .",
    "it is indicated by the gray filled squares in fig .  [",
    "fig : zeta-0.1](a ) and further characterized in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta-0.1](f ) for @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "again the trajectory in real space is of cycloidal shape .",
    "however , as can be seen from the trajectory in @xmath25-@xmath87 space , the value of @xmath25 stays close to zero with only small oscillations around it .",
    "thus , in contrast to the cycloidal i motion , the elongation axis of deformation remains approximately horizontal for all times .",
    "in the previous two sections , we considered simplified special cases of the dynamic equations ( [ eq : x ] ) and ( [ eq : v])([eq : omega ] ) to identify the basic states of motion .",
    "first we neglected deformations in sec .",
    "[ sec : solution without deformation in 2d ] , then we excluded active contributions from the rotational spinning motion in sec .",
    "[ sec : zeta=-0.1 ] . nevertheless , the dynamics in both cases was already quite complex .",
    "this complexity is increased even further when we now investigate the full active dynamics .",
    "for example qualitatively new quasi - periodic and chaotic states arise .",
    "we use the same methods and the same parameter values as in the previous section to study the full set of dynamic equations ( [ eq : x ] ) and ( [ eq : v])([eq : omega ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that now active rotations of the particle , which we call active spinning motions , are taken into account .",
    "they are induced by setting @xmath43 to a positive value , @xmath130 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) . since the rotational symmetry of space is broken by the shear flow given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ugamma ] ) with @xmath131 , we distinguish between two cases .",
    "first , we consider clockwise active rotations of the particle , after that counter - clockwise spinning motions .",
    "the rotational part of the shear flow itself is oriented in the clockwise direction .",
    "our results are again presented in terms of the quantities introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ s ] ) , ( [ v ] ) , and ( [ psi ] ) .          without an externally imposed shear flow , i.e.  for @xmath107 , the situation of active spinning has been recently investigated by some of the present authors @xcite . for the parameters that we have chosen in this paper ,",
    "two types of motion have been found in the absence of the shear flow : circular and quasi - periodic motions .",
    "we repeat these results on the left border of our phase diagram fig .  [",

    "[ fig : zeta1.5_negative](a ) and is indicated by the red open squares .",

    "next , a _ quasi - periodic motion _ is marked by the black crosses in the phase diagram fig",
    ".  [ fig : zeta1.5_negative](a ) .",
    "it occurs at intermediate self - propulsion strengths @xmath41 .",

    "we further characterize it in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta1.5_negative](b ) for @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "obviously , the motion is not simply periodic as evident from the real - space trajectory and from the trajectories indicated in the @xmath25-@xmath87 and @xmath24-@xmath118 phase spaces by the black dots .",
    "however , it is quasi - periodic and not chaotic , because the return maps give discrete closed loops as shown in the second column of fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta1.5_negative](b ) .",
    "the difference between the quasi - periodic motion in the absence of the shear flow and the one in the presence of the shear flow is simply that the particle stays within a finite area in the former case while in the latter case it escapes over time in the positive or negative @xmath109-direction .",
    "when the shear rate @xmath68 is increased , several new types of motion are found that we have not observed before .",
    "interestingly , all of them are sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "we find a coexistence of at least two types of motion at every point of the phase diagram that we investigated for these new dynamic states , which leads to the superposition of the symbols in fig .  [",

    "we can distinguish this kind of motion from the quasi - periodic motion by the return map in the second column of fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta1.5_negative](c ) , where thousands of measured trajectory extrema condense on ten discrete points in contrast to the closed loop object in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta1.5_negative](b ) .",
    "there are even some coexistence points of periodic and quasi - periodic motion in the phase diagram , induced by different initial conditions .",

    "[ fig : zeta1.5_negative](e ) and ( f ) .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the dynamics of a deformable active particle in shear flow . for that purpose ,",
    "we have considered a soft deformable particle with two types of activity : one is a spontaneous propulsion and the other one is a spontaneous spinning motion .",

    "on the one hand , in the limit of vanishing shear flow , we reproduce the previous results of refs .  .",
    "on the other hand , for vanishing particle deformability , we obtain an approximate analytical solution that is consistent with previous investigations @xcite .",

    "our predictions can be verified in experiments on self - propelled droplets exposed to shear flow .",
    "for instance , in some experiments @xcite self - propelled droplets on liquid - air interfaces can be exposed to linear shear fields by putting the carrier liquid between two parallel confining walls that move alongside into opposite directions .",
    "this induces an approximately planar linear shear gradient at the surface of the carrier liquid , if the liquid container is sufficiently deep . since the motion of the droplets",
    "is confined to the liquid - air interface , the geometry is quasi - two dimensional . using this experimental set - up , it is in principle possible to verify the phenomena predicted by our analysis .",
    "future studies should address several extensions of our model : first of all , different prescribed flow fields can be explored using our equations .",
    "most noticeable examples include a poiseuille flow @xcite or an imposed vorticity field .",
    "we expect again a manifold of different types of motion in these flow fields presuming that the different flow topologies will induce different types of motion .",
    "the next step is to extend our analysis to a finite concentration of particles and to include steric interactions between them .",
    "this is a complex problem which is already very difficult for rigid self - propelled particles @xcite .",
    "another step is to extend the current analysis of the model to three spatial dimensions . in a previous study ,",
    "some of us demonstrated that  without shear flow ",
    "a particle can exhibit additional qualitatively different types of motion when comparing a three- to a two - dimensional set - up @xcite . in the case without shear flow , these were additional helical and superhelical types of motion @xcite .",
    "thus we expect that further new types of dynamics can arise in three dimensions when the shear flow is included .",
    "finally one could access the dynamics of propelled vesicles by using our analysis as a starting point . here",
    "one should impose the constraints of constant volume and constant surface area of the deformable particle .",
