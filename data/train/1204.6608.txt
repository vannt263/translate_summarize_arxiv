    "it has been almost one century since einstein introduced his theory of general relativity ( gr ) as a mathematical framework within which the evolution of the universe can be coherently described . remarkably successful as it has been as a foundation of modern cosmology , the triumph of gr is contingent upon one crucial caveat that the universe is dominantly filled with an exotic energy component with negative pressure ( dubbed _ dark energy _ ) which is believed to accelerate the universe at present epoch @xcite .",
    "although the cosmological constant @xmath3 devised by einstein himself is currently the paradigm of dark energy , the extreme fine - tuning of @xmath3 required to explain the observations has provoked skepticism among the cosmologists about the validity of the standard @xmath3cdm cosmology ( @xmath3+cold dark matter ) based on gr .",
    "recently , a flurry of research has been conducted on modified gravity ( mg ) models , which attempt to modify gr on large scales so that the apparent acceleration of the universe can be realized without introducing dark energy ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . among many different mg models that have been put forward so far ,",
    "the @xmath2 gravity @xcite has attracted even more attentions after the recent stringent observational tests @xcite .",
    "basically , the @xmath2 gravity generalizes the ricci scalar @xmath5 in the einstein - hilbert action for gr to a specific function of @xmath5 , which gives rise to an extra scalar degree of freedom @xmath6 , dubbed _ scalaron _ @xcite .",
    "the scalaron produces an additional fifth force that modifies gr on large scales . in highly dense environments , however , due to the chameleon mechanism that effectively shields the fifth force , gr is recovered @xcite . for a given functional form of @xmath2 , the formation of the cosmic structures and its clustering strength",
    "is determined by the magnitude of scalaron at the present epoch , @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath3cdm cosmology based on gr corresponds to the case of @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "the non - zero value of @xmath10 that is the essential feature of @xmath2 gravity , however , should be small enough to meet the observational constraints .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will focus on the hu - sawicki @xmath2 gravity which has the following functional form @xcite @xmath11 with two characteristic parameters of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 with mean matter density @xmath15 at present epoch , and the free parameter @xmath13 is related to the @xmath3 density ( @xmath16 ) and matter density ( @xmath17 ) parameters as @xmath18 which mimics the evolution of the @xmath3cdm background .",
    "regarding the other free parameter , @xmath12 , we set its value at unity as in the previous works @xcite .",
    "the observed abundance of galaxy clusters has constrained the present value of the scalaron in the hu - sawicki model to be @xmath19 @xcite , while the solar system test puts a more stringent constraint of @xmath20 for the milky way halo @xcite .",
    "when the scalaron meets this constraint , however , it is very difficult to distinguish the @xmath2 gravity model from the @xmath3cdm model based on gr since there is very little difference between the two models in their predictions for almost all observables .",
    "here we suggest that it might be possible to discriminate @xmath2 gravity from gr by measuring the specific angular momentum distribution of the low - mass galactic halos located in low - density environments ( i.e. , the field regions ) where the chameleon mechanism functions less effectively .",
    "we expect that due to the effect of the fifth force of the scalaron the low - mass field galactic halos in the @xmath2 gravity case would acquire higher specific angular momentum than those in the gr case .",
    "whereas , the galactic halos located in high - density environments where the chameleon shielding mechanism effectively screens the fifth force would not show any difference in the specific angular momentum distribution between the two models @xcite .    note that the expected enhancement in the specific angular momentum of the low - mass field galactic halos is essentially the same effect of the fifth force that enhances the velocity dispersion of unscreened halos , which was first discussed by @xcite and also by @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that for the case of the angular momentum what takes into account is only the velocity components perpendicular to the separation from the halo center on which the gravity act as a tidal torque forces",
    ". the enhanced gravity due to the presence of the fifth force leads to the enhanced tidal torque forces which in turn induces higher angular momentum of an unscreened halo .    to investigate quantitatively",
    "how significantly the distribution of the specific angular momentum differs between the gr and the @xmath2 gravity cases , we use the high - resolution n - body simulations for the two models to determine the distributions of the specific angular momentum of the low - mass field galactic halos .",
    "being conservative , we consider the case of @xmath21 as our fiducial @xmath2 gravity model , calling it `` f6 model '' from here on .",
    "the contents of this paper are outlined as follows . in section [ sec : analysis ] we describe the numerical data from the n - body simulations and present the results on the specific angular momentum and spin parameter distributions of the low - mass field galactic halos for the gr and the f6 cases . in section [ sec : implication ] we speculate a possibility of using the abundance of the low surface brightness galaxies as a probe of modified gravity . in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] we discuss the results and draw a final conclusion .",
    "we have performed high - resolution @xmath1-body simulations which implement the ecosmog code @xcite to compute the trajectories of @xmath22 dark matter particles in a periodic box of size @xmath23mpc on a side for the gr and f6 models .",
    "the key cosmological parameters that describe the initial conditions of each model are identically set at the wmap7 values ( @xmath24 ) @xcite .",
    "the bound dark matter halos are identified from the simulation data by applying the ahf ( amiga s halo finder ) code @xcite which defines the halo mass @xmath25 as the top - hat mass enclosed by the spherical radius @xmath5 at which the overdensity reaches the threshold value of @xmath26 at @xmath0 . for the details of the simulations and the halo - identification procedures ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .    among the identified halos for each model ,",
    "we select only those well resolved halos which consist of @xmath27 or more dark matter particles ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "then , we measure the physical angular momentum , @xmath29 , of each selected halo as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the mass , velocity and position of the @xmath33-th particle belonging to the halo . here",
    "the positions of of the component particles , @xmath34 , are all measured with respect to the center of mass of their host halo .",
    "we divide the selected halos into the _ field _ halos and the _ wall _ halos by applying the friends - of - friends ( fof ) criterion which has been conventionally used in observational data analysis for the separation between the field and the wall galaxies .",
    "the usefulness of the fof criterion lies in the fact that it requires no other information than the positions of the sample galaxies and thus that it can be readily applied to real observational data in practice .",
    "very recently , @xcite and @xcite have developed more elaborate criteria with which the screened and unscreened halos can be separated .",
    "however , in the current work , we choose the simple fof criterion for the practical purpose .",
    "we first measure the mean separation distance @xmath35 among the selected halos , and then classify those isolated halos which do not have any neighboring halos within the threshold distance of @xmath36 as field halos , where @xmath37 is the linkage length parameter .",
    "the rest of the selected halos are classified as wall halos which have at least one neighboring halo within @xmath36 , residing in relatively higher density regions .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath37 is , the more isolated the field galactic halos are . here",
    ", we set the linkage length parameter at @xmath38 .",
    "we also restrict our analysis to the _ galactic _ halos which are less massive than a given mass threshold @xmath39 for which we consider two cases of @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in table",
    "[ tab : n_field ] we list the total number of the well - resolved halos with @xmath28 ( @xmath42 ) , the mean halo separation @xmath35 , the numbers of the field galactic halos for two different mass thresholds .",
    "the specific angular momentum , @xmath43 , of each field ( wall ) galactic halo is computed as @xmath44 , in unit of @xmath45 $ ] . binning the magnitude of the specific angular momentum , @xmath46 , and counting the number @xmath47 , of the field ( wall ) galactic halos which belong to each @xmath46-bin",
    ", we determine the probability density distribution of the specific angular momentum of the field ( wall ) galactic halos as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the total number of the field ( wall ) galactic halos and @xmath50 represents the size of each @xmath46-bin .",
    "figure [ fig : proj ] shows the probability density distributions , @xmath51 , of the field and wall galactic halos with the jack - knife errors for two different cases of @xmath39 in four separate panels .",
    "we construct eight jack - knife resamples of equal size and then calculated @xmath52 as one standard deviation scatter of @xmath51 among the eight resamples . in each panel",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent the result for the gr and f6 cases , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , the galactic halos in the f6 model have higher specific angular momentum than those in gr .",
    "furthermore , the field galactic halos with lower mass of @xmath53 exhibit the largest difference between the two models .",
    "we interpret this result as follows . the enhanced gravity in the f6 model exerts enhanced tidal torque forces on the proto - galaxies in the field regions , and in consequence the field galactic halos for the f6 case to acquire higher specific angular momentum than for the gr case .    to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the distribution of the specific angular momentum of the low - mass field galactic halos between the gr and the f6 cases , we perform the two - sample ks ( kolmogorov - smirnov ) test @xcite . figure [ fig : ks ] shows the cumulative fraction function of the specific angular momentum of the low - mass field galactic halos ( @xmath53 ) for the gr ( solid line ) and f6 ( dashed line ) cases .",
    "measuring the ks statistic , i.e. , the maximum distance between the two cumulative fraction functions is found to be @xmath54 , which rejects the null hypothesis at @xmath55 confidence level .",
    "now that the difference in the distribution of @xmath46 of the low - mass field galactic halos between the gr and f6 cases is found to be statistically significant , it is important to see whether the two cases have comparable mass distributions . for this , we first calculate the following three quantities : first , the probability density distribution of the logarithmic mass of the field galactic halos as @xmath56 , where@xmath49 is the total number of the field galactic halos , @xmath47 is the number of the field galactic halos belonging to each logarithmic mass bin and @xmath57 is the size of the logarithmic mass bin .",
    "second , the number densities of the field galactic halos per unit volume , @xmath58 in unit of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 represents the volume of the simulation box .",
    "third , the mean mass of the field galactic halos belonging to each logarithmic mass bin , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 represents the sum of the masses of the field galactic halos belonging to each logarithmic mass bin .",
    "figure  [ fig : mf ] shows @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the bottom and top panels , respectively .",
    "in each panel the solid and dashed lines represent the gr and f6 cases , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , although the f6 model yields @xmath65 increment in the amplitude of the mass function of the field galactic halos , @xmath63 in the two models are almost identical to each other .",
    "figure  [ fig : mratio ] shows the ratio of @xmath66 for the f6 case to that for the gr case , which reveals that the difference in the mean mass between the two models is less than @xmath67 in the whole mass range of the field galactic halos .",
    "the results shown in figures [ fig : mf]-[fig : mratio ] prove that the two samples are comparable in the mass distribution and thus that the difference in @xmath46 between the two models are not due to the mass - bias .    to test",
    "if the difference in @xmath51 of the low - mass galactic halos between the gr and f6 models shown in figure [ fig : proj ] is really due to the effect of the fifth force but not due to any possible numerical flukes , we multiply the factor of @xmath68 to the values of @xmath46 of the low - mass field galactic halos for the gr case and determine its probability density distribution , @xmath69 $ ] . the gravitational tidal force in the low - density regions",
    "can be enhanced by a maximum factor of @xmath70 for the f6 case . that is , the low - mass field galactic halos at their proto - galactic stages would experience enhanced gravitational tidal force in the f6 model . in consequence , the velocities that enter in the definition of the specific angular momentum would increase by a maximum factor of @xmath68 , which in turn leads to the enhanced specific angular momentum of the low - mass field galactic halos by the same factor .",
    "therefore , it is expected that @xmath71 $ ] should match the probability density distribution of @xmath46 of the low - mass field galactic halos for the f6 case , @xmath72 .",
    "figure  [ fig : convert ] shows @xmath71 $ ] ( dotted line ) and compares it with @xmath72 ( dashed line ) . as can be seen",
    ", the two distributions agree with each other very well , which confirms that the difference in @xmath51 of the low - mass field galactic halos is due to the effect of modified gravity which can be enhanced by a maximum factor of @xmath70 in the low - density environments .",
    "this result is also consistent with the previous works of @xcite and @xcite who showed that the effect of mg enhances the velocity dispersion of a unscreened halo by a factor of @xmath68 .",
    "the fact that the measurements of the velocity dispersion and the specific angular momentum yield an enhancement of the same factor for unscreened halos indicates that the velocity structure is unchanged by the modified forces at first order .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio_fw ] shows the ratio of @xmath51 of the wall galactic halos to that of the field galactic halos , @xmath73 , for the gr and f6 cases . as can be seen , for gr , the ratio increases rapidly with @xmath46 , while for the f6 case the rate of the increase of the ratio with @xmath46 is much milder .",
    "the dominance of wall galactic halos in the high-@xmath46 section is attributed to frequent merger events in high - density regions .",
    "as the merging rate is much lower in the field field regions for the gr case , it is natural to expect that most of the field galactic halos are biased toward the low @xmath46 section .",
    "in contrast , for the f6 case , even though frequent merging events do not occur in the low - density regions , the unscreened fifth force has an effect of spinning up the field galactic halos , resulting in the increase of the relative abundance of the high-@xmath46 field galactic halos and the decrease of @xmath73 at the high-@xmath46 end .",
    "one may also expect that the more field field galactic halos would acquire on average stronger effect of the enhanced gravitational tidal force since the degree of the chameleon effect is lower in the more field regions . to investigate how the probability density distribution , @xmath51 , depends on the degree of the isolation of the field galactic halos , we calculate @xmath51 repeatedly , varying the value of @xmath37 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio_mg ] shows the ratio of @xmath51 of the field galactic halos for the f6 case to that for the gr case , @xmath76 , for three different cases of the linkage parameter @xmath37 . as can be seen , the larger the value of @xmath37 is , the larger the ratio , @xmath76 is in the high-@xmath46 section .",
    "this result is consistent with the picture that the chameleon screening of @xmath2 gravity becomes less effective in low - density regions .      the specific angular momentum of a galactic halo is commonly expressed in terms of the dimensionless spin parameter @xcite , which is efficiently defined as @xmath77 ( * ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "n - body simulations found that the probability density distribution of this dimensionless spin parameter is well approximated by the following log - normal distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath78.\\ ] ] with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "n - body simulations also revealed that the shape of @xmath81 is almost independent of the initial conditions of the universe , always following the log - normal form with the same values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent observations also showed that the spin parameters of the observed galaxies seem to be only very weakly correlated with the other physical properties of the galaxies such as overdensity , mass , shape and internal structure @xcite .    for each field galactic halo from our simulation",
    ", we compute the spin parameter and calculate the probability density distribution , @xmath81 , for the case of the field galactic halos with @xmath53 . fitting the numerically obtained spin parameter distribution , @xmath81 , of the field galactic halos to equation ( [ eqn : lambda ] ) , we determine the best - fit values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 for both of the gr and f6 cases .",
    "figure  [ fig : prol ] shows @xmath81 ( square and circular dots ) with the jackknife errors and compares them with the best - fit log - normal distributions ( solid and dashed lines ) for the gr and f6 cases , respectively , in the top panel . as can be seen ,",
    "@xmath81 is indeed well approximated by the log - normal distribution for both of the cases .",
    "table  [ tab : spin_para ] lists the best - fit values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 for the two models .",
    "as can be read , for the gr case , the best - fit values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are consistent with the previous n - body results @xcite , while the f6 case yields larger values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 as expected .",
    "our result for the gr case confirms the claim of the previous works that the spin parameter distribution is insensitive to the halo mass scale , surrounding overdensity , and the background cosmology .",
    "note that even though we have considered only the field galactic halos with mass less than @xmath4 from a n - body simulation for a wmap7 cosmology , we have obtained the log - normal distribution of @xmath81 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 which is identical to the result of @xcite who used all dark matter halos from a n - body simulation with different cosmological parameters to derive @xmath81 .",
    "now that @xmath81 is found to differ significantly between the gr and f6 cases while it is insensitive to the background cosmology , the spin parameter distribution of the low - mass field galactic halos should be a sensitive indicator of underlying gravity .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : prol ] shows the ratio of the probability density distribution of @xmath84 for the f6 case to that for gr , @xmath85 . as can be seen , the ratio exceeds unity at @xmath86 and increases sharply in the high-@xmath84 section ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the cumulative probability of @xmath88 are found to be @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the gr and f6 cases , respectively .",
    "the results presented in section [ sec : pl ] has an interesting possible implication on the abundance of the low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) whose apparent fluxes are an order of magnitude lower than the night sky .",
    "the lsbgs have been found to occupy a significant fraction ( @xmath91 ) of the total field galaxy population ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "very recently , @xcite determined the galaxy luminosity function , using a magnitude limited sample of the galaxies with @xmath5-band magnitude less than @xmath92 from the smithsonian hectospec lensing survey ( shels ) which is a dense redshift survey covering a four degree square region at redshifts @xmath93 .",
    "they found that the slope of the luminosity function in the faint - end increases up to @xmath94 from @xmath95 when the lsb drawf galaxies in the field are included .",
    "regarding the origin of the lsbgs , several theoretical studies suggested a hypothesis that the only difference of the lsbgs from the ordinary galaxies is their biased formation in the fast - spinning dark halos with @xmath87 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . the faster spinning motion of a host halo results in the decrements of the surface density of its disk galaxy , which in turn is directly proportional to the surface brightness . to test this hypothesis",
    ", @xcite constructed a theoretical model under the assumption that the dark halos where the lsbgs reside have relatively higher specific angular momentum with the spin parameters larger than @xmath96 , and compared the predictions of their model with the observed properties of the lsbgs . according to their results ,",
    "the theoretically predicted properties of the lsbgs such as colors , metalliticty and spectra are all in excellent agreements with the observed values .",
    "the results of @xcite have been confirmed by the follow - up works @xcite .",
    "now that the lsbgs are found to occupy a significant fraction of the field galaxy population ( over @xmath97 ) and located in the fast - spinning dark halos , a fundamental question is whether or not the standard @xmath3cdm cosmology can produce such abundant fast - spinning dark halos in the field regions . at face values ,",
    "our results then imply that mg , if existent , would produce more lsbgs in the field regions .",
    "the difference between the relative abundances of the lsbgs in the gr and f6 cases ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively ) is definitely significant even though the f6 model is very similar to gr in its predictions for most other observables .    besides , it has been known that the spin parameters of dark matter halos depend only very weakly on the initial conditions of the universe . for instance",
    ", @xcite have shown by n - body simulations that the spin parameters of dark halos are uncorrelated with the initial overdensities .",
    "@xcite have also found through n - body simulations that there is very weak correlation between the spin parameter @xmath84 and the initial rms density fluctuation @xmath100 , concluding that the spin parameters should be independent of the type of the initial power spectrum .",
    "recently , @xcite have found by analyzing the observational data that the spin parameters of the local disk galaxies are uncorrelated with the other physical properties of them .",
    "given our result that the f6 model yields more dark halos with @xmath87 and the previous results that the spin parameter is almost independent of the initial conditions of the universe , the relative fraction of the lsbgs that are believed to reside in halos with @xmath87 could be an optimal indicator of the effect of mg .",
    "analyzing the numerical data from the high - resolution n - body simulations for the hu - sawicki @xmath2 gravity with @xmath101 ( f6 model ) , we have shown that the probability density distribution , @xmath51 , of the specific angular momentum of the low - mass field galactic halos with @xmath53 in the f6 model is significantly shifted toward the higher @xmath46 section than in the gr case . the null hypothesis that there is no difference in @xmath51 between the gr and the f6 models",
    "is rejected via the ks test at the @xmath102 confidence level .",
    "we have also determined from the numerical data the probability density distributions of the dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath81 , for the gr and the f6 models and found that the high - spin field galactic halos with @xmath87 occupy @xmath103 and @xmath99 of the total field galactic halo populations for the gr and the f6 models , respectively . given this result and under the assumption that the host halos of the low - surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) have spin parameters larger than @xmath96 , we speculate a possibility of discriminating the @xmath2 gravity from the gr with the relative abundance of the lsbgs in the field regions .    in order to use the lsbgs as a test of gravity , however",
    ", it will be first necessary to assess the possible systematic involved in modeling the surface brightness of the disk galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite recently claimed that the dwarf void galaxies could be significantly brighter in mg models with chameleon mechanism since the unscreened mg in void regions would play a role of enhancing the intrinsic luminosity of the main sequence stars .",
    "the situation could be subtle when other factors are taken into account .",
    "for example , the unscreened mg would not only brighten up the stars , but also change the dynamical properties of the host halos .",
    "these effects need to be taken into account to relate our predictions for dark matter halos to the abundance of the lsbgs .",

    "<S> the largest difference in the specific angular momentum distribution between these two models occurs for the case of the isolated galactic halos with mass less than @xmath4 , which are likely least shielded by the chameleon screening mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> as the specific angular momentum of galactic halos is rather insensitive to the other cosmological parameters , it can in principle be an independent discriminator of modified gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate a possibility of using the relative abundance of the low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) as a test of gr given that the formation of the lsbgs befalls in the fast spinning dark halos . </S>"
