    "these results pinpoint to a propagation regime wherein early - time perpendicular transport can not be neglected .",
    "it is well known that the transport of charged particles in turbulence depends on the anisotropy of the power spectrum @xcite .",

    "the rate of separation of turbulent field lines along the direction of the mean field was found in @xcite , by solving a fokker - planck equation , to be very fast in the 3d isotropic power - spectrum turbulence , resulting in a significant perpendicular transport solely due to field - line meandering .",
    "@xcite , arguing that field lines diverge exponentially along the mean field direction , found that even if the particle does not undergo significant pitch - angle scattering ( `` collisionless '' case ) , the jump from a field line to another warrants a strong perpendicular diffusion due to the exponential divergence .",

    "[ conclusion ] contains the conclusions .",
    "critical balance condition along with the assumption that the energy cascade rate is scale - independent ( gs95 ) yields the scaling @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the components of the wavenumber @xmath13 parallel and perpendicular to the local average magnetic field , respectively , and @xmath14 is some outer scale which might coincide with the injection scale of the turbulence .",
    "such a scaling holds for a large - scale field alfvnic mach number @xmath15 , as originally assumed in gs95 ; a more general scaling reads @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the previous scaling implies that the anisotropy increases at the smaller scales .",
    "the power at wave - vectors not satisfying the critical balance is exponentially suppressed .",
    "however , as well known , the functional form of the power spectrum is not predicted by the gs95 conjecture and various possibilities have been explored ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) .    in the gs95",
    "anisotropy the scales of the turbulent eddies parallel and perpendicular are measured only with respect to the direction of the local magnetic field @xcite that varies according to the location and the scale , whereas in slab or 3d isotropic weak turbulence the direction of the global average statistically uniform field is independent on the scale .",
    "numerical simulations confirm the ratio of parallel and perpendicular scales of the eddies , as well as the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , implied by the gs95 power spectrum @xcite .    a spatially homogeneous , fluctuating , time - independent global magnetic field @xmath19 is considered .",
    "the total field is decomposed as @xmath20 , with an average component @xmath21 and a fluctuation @xmath22 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath23 gives the direction of the global average field component .",
    "such a time - independent decomposition of @xmath24 applies to the solar wind , where the propagation of the magnetic fluctuation is much smaller than the velocity of the bulk ionized fluid .    in this paper , we assume that the inertial range extends from the outer scale @xmath14 down to some scale wherein injected energy ultimately must dissipate .",
    "we introduce a scale @xmath25 , much larger than the gyroradius @xmath26 of the particles considered here ( fig . [ cartoon ] ) .",

    "the resulting parallel transport depends only on the large scale @xmath14 and not on the intermediate scale @xmath31 .",
    "the most general form of the power spectrum tensor for mhd fluctuations was derived in @xcite , in their eq .",

    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "the scalar functions @xmath39 are interpreted in terms of different linear mhd polarisation modes for an oblique orientation between @xmath34 and the local average magnetic field .",
    "in particular , @xmath40 is related to the power in the shear - alfvn modes @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 to the difference between shear- and pseudo - alfvn modes power @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 .    the power spectrum given by eq .",
    "[ oughton_ps ] includes the shear- and pseudo - alfvn mode only , and assumes vanishing cross - helicity , i.e. , the modes @xmath46 and @xmath47 in eq.(20 ) in @xcite .",
    "fast solar wind measurements @xcite are compatible with vanishing mode @xmath48 ; here the mode @xmath49 is neglected , as expected to be comparably small .    a series of incompressible mhd numerical simulations @xcite implemented the axisymmetric power spectrum tensor given by eq.[oughton_ps ] to empirically determine the functional form of @xmath50 and @xmath51 and best - fit the shear - modes power @xmath52 by using @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a normalisation constant to be determined , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the power spectrum cut - off where dissipative effects start to be important and mhd approximation breaks down , and @xmath15 . according to the gs95 conjecture , the pseudo - alfvn modes are carried passively by the shear - alfvn modes ( this property is an exact result for weak mhd turbulence @xcite ) with no contribution to the turbulence cascade to small scales which is seeded by collisions of shear modes only .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath57 has the same functional form as @xmath58 , allowing for a relative amplitude @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and a different outer scale @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) both so far inaccessible to either solar wind observations or models .",
    "likewise , the power spectrum of the pseudo - modes is cast in the form @xmath63 the constant @xmath54 is fixed by normalisation of both polarisation modes that can be extended to scales between @xmath31 and @xmath14 , as the contribution from scales between @xmath31 and @xmath14 is exponentially suppressed . within the range @xmath64 , if the largest scales @xmath65 are related to the outer scale by @xmath66 , the normalisation reads : @xmath67 which gives @xmath68 , where @xmath69 was used .",
    "we note that @xmath54 does not depend on the scale @xmath31 neither on @xmath70 , that is irrelevant as the cascade along the local average field is suppressed .",
    "recent analysis of fast solar wind data from _ ulysses _ @xcite provides us with an estimate of @xmath59 by confirming an ordering in diagonal components of the power tensor that has long been found @xcite : if @xmath38 is the unit vector in the direction of the local average magnetic field , the measurements give a power along @xmath38 smaller , but not negligible ( @xmath71 ) , than in the plane orthogonal to @xmath38 .",
    "as shown in sect .",
    "[ coeff_diff ] , such a power ordering results in a small but not negligible effect on the perpendicular transport of the pseudo modes with respect to the shear modes .",

    "only the terms growing fastest in time are retained .",
    "we note that no assumption is necessary on the explicit spatial dependence of @xmath75 , that has three non - vanishing space components , as only the fourier transform @xmath76 is used .",
    "the magnetostatic approximation has been widely used for decades @xcite to investigate the transport of charged particles in magnetic turbulence , as the speed of the particles considered is typically much greater than the average - field alfvn speed .",
    "solar wind flows outward from the sun at a speed of several hundreds of km@xmath77s ( 300 - 400 at low heliolatitudes and 700 at high heliolatitudes ) , much faster than the local alfvn speed ( tens of km@xmath77s ) and the spacecraft speed ( a few km@xmath77s ) .",

    "this is in agreement with the limit case of the slab - turbulence , i.e. , anisotropy wherein the power along the the mean field direction is completely suppressed : the gradient / curvature drift average square displacement @xmath87 is dominated by small scales ( fj11 ) , whereas the larger scales govern the mfl meandering .      in this subsection",

    "the measured much larger ( nearly @xmath188 ) longitudinal spread certainly includes additional factors not considered here such as : angular extension and motion of the cme - driven shock producing the seps and sun s spin dragging the parker spiral across the heliosphere",
