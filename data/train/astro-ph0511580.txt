    "in the current paradigm of structure formation , galaxies form by the dissipative collapse of baryons in halos of cold dark matter ( cdm ) . understanding the relation between",
    "the galaxy and dark matter distributions is the key challenge in interpreting the observed clustering of galaxies .",
    "large area imaging surveys have provided a new tool for untangling this relationship , galaxy - galaxy weak lensing , which uses the subtle distortion of background galaxy shapes to measure average mass profiles around samples of foreground galaxies .",
    "the last few years have seen rapid growth in this field , with the first tentative detections @xcite giving way to high signal - to - noise ratio measurements over a substantial dynamic range ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in a cosmological context , the strength of the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal for a given galaxy sample should depend mainly on the mean matter density @xmath2 and the amplitude of dark matter fluctuations @xmath3 , since increasing either parameter enhances the average amount of dark matter around galaxies and thereby amplifies the lensing signal .",
    "is the rms linear theory matter fluctuation in spheres of radius @xmath24 , with @xmath25 . ] in this paper , we develop tools for constraining @xmath2 and @xmath3 with galaxy - galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering measurements , using halo occupation models of galaxy bias that are applicable from the linear regime into the fully non - linear regime .",
    "our approach extends and complements earlier work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "galaxy - galaxy lensing measures the profiles of mean tangential shear around galaxies .",
    "with knowledge of source and lens redshift distributions , this tangential shear can be converted to excess surface density , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mean surface density interior to the disk of projected radius @xmath19 and @xmath28 is the averaged surface density in a thin annulus of the same radius @xcite . to refer to a projected ( two - dimensional ) or a three - dimensional radius . ]",
    "the excess surface density profile is itself related to the galaxy - matter cross - correlation function @xmath29 by @xmath30 , \\nonumber \\label{eq : int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the critical density of the universe . @xcite",
    "discuss and test methods of inverting @xmath0 to obtain the three - dimensional @xmath10 .",
    "here we treat @xmath0 as the primary observable and concentrate on predicting it directly .    on large scales ,",
    "where matter fluctuations are linear , the relation between the matter auto - correlation function @xmath32 , the galaxy - matter cross - correlation function @xmath29 , and the galaxy auto - correlation function @xmath33 may be adequately described by the linear bias model , @xmath34 @xmath35 where the linear bias factor @xmath36 is the same in both equations @xcite .",
    "thus , measurements of @xmath33 and @xmath37 can be combined to yield @xmath38 .",
    "since the amplitude of galaxy fluctuations is @xmath39 in the linear bias model , this method in turn constrains the product @xmath40 .",
    "redshift - space distortions of the galaxy power spectrum and the abundance of rich galaxy clusters as a function of mass both depend on a parameter combination that is approximately @xmath41 @xcite , so the combination of galaxy - galaxy lensing with either of these measurements can break the degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , the linear bias approximation may break down on the scales @xmath42 several @xmath43 where @xmath0 is measured with high precision .",
    "moreover , if the relation between galaxy and matter density contrasts is linear but stochastic , then the linear bias factor @xmath36 in equation  ( [ eq : rbias ] ) should be replaced by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the galaxy - matter cross - correlation coefficient @xcite , and the constrained combination becomes @xmath46 even in the linear regime .",
    "the addition of @xmath45 as a free parameter reduces the cosmological constraining power of the @xmath47 and @xmath33 combination , and restoring it requires an independent determination of @xmath32 .",
    "cosmic shear measurements can provide such a determination @xcite , but these measurements are challenging and suffer larger systematic errors than galaxy - galaxy lensing .    @xcite used imaging and photometric redshift data from the red - sequence cluster survey @xcite to measure aperture fluctuations proportional to @xmath33 , @xmath29 , and @xmath32 .",
    "they provided tentative evidence that @xmath36 and @xmath19 are each individually scale - dependent but that the ratio @xmath48 is approximately constant , with @xmath49 for @xmath50 . using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , which provides spectroscopic redshifts of lens galaxies and image shapes and photometric redshifts of source galaxies , @xcite detected galaxy - galaxy lensing and measured the galaxy - matter correlation function from 0.025 to @xmath51 ( see @xcite and @xcite for earlier sdss measurements , and @xcite for more recent measurements at @xmath52 ) .",
    "they found that the galaxy - galaxy correlation function and the galaxy - matter correlation function agree in shape , with an amplitude ratio that implies @xmath53 for galaxy samples of mean luminosity @xmath54 .    to circumvent the limitations of the linear bias approximation , we model galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - matter correlations using halo occupation methods , following the lead of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) provides a fully non - linear description of the relation between galaxies and mass by specifying the probability @xmath55 that a halo of virial mass @xmath56 contains @xmath8 galaxies of a particular class , along with any spatial or velocity biases within individual halos .",
    ", in approximate dynamical equilibrium , which may contain a single bright galaxy or a group or a cluster of galaxies . ]",
    "numerous authors have used this approach to compute analytic approximations for galaxy and dark matter clustering statistics ( e.g. , @xcite ; see review by @xcite ) , and to model observed galaxy clustering ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical predictions for the hod of different galaxy types have been calculated using semi - analytic models , hydrodynamic simulations , and high resolution @xmath8-body calculations that identify `` galaxies '' with dark matter substructures @xcite .",
    "our basic approach to modeling galaxy - galaxy lensing in the hod framework is similar to that adopted by @xcite for modeling mass - to - light ratios and redshift - space distortions . since measurements of the galaxy power spectrum , cosmic microwave background anisotropies , and the ly@xmath17 forest yield tight constraints on the shape of the linear matter power spectrum @xmath57 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we take this shape to be fixed and investigate the parameter space spanned by @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for a given choice of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we first choose hod parameters to match observations of the projected galaxy correlation function @xmath58 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we then predict the excess surface density profile @xmath0 for this combination of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and hod .",
    "comparison to galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements then determines the acceptable combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we impose the observed galaxy - galaxy correlation function as a constraint on the hod , instead of taking ratios as in the linear bias analysis .",
    "there is no need for an unknown cross - correlation coefficient @xmath45 because any `` stochasticity '' between galaxy and mass density fields is automatically incorporated in the hod calculation .",
    "our strategy complements that of @xcite and @xcite , who focus on constraining halo masses , halo profiles , and satellite fractions using @xmath0 alone , rather than constraining @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "our eventual conclusions about the cosmological constraining power of galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements rest on an analytic model for computing @xmath0 given @xmath57 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the galaxy hod .",
    "this model is similar in spirit to that of @xcite , but it differs in many details , in part because we define the calculational problem in different terms .",
    "we test the analytic model against numerical calculations , in which we use a specified hod to populate the halos of @xmath8-body simulations , placing `` central '' galaxies at the halo potential minimum and `` satellite '' galaxies at the locations of randomly selected dark matter particles .",
    "both our analytic model and our method of populating @xmath8-body halos ignore the impact of dark matter @xmath59 around the individual satellite galaxies orbiting in a larger halo . to begin , therefore , we test the validity of the `` populated halo '' approach itself , by comparing @xmath0 for the galaxy population of a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation to that found by populating the dark matter halos of this simulation with `` galaxies '' placed on randomly selected dark matter particles .",
    "this test shows that satellite subhalos have minimal impact on @xmath0 and that the populated halo approach is acceptable for our purpose .",
    "we also show that any environmental dependence of halo galaxy content at fixed halo mass @xcite has little discernible impact on the galaxy - galaxy or galaxy - matter correlation functions in our sph simulations .",
    "more generally , our sph and @xmath8-body tests indicate that the analytic model should be accurate at the @xmath60 level on scales @xmath61 .",
    "this level of accuracy is acceptable for present purposes , since the current measurement errors are typically @xmath62 per radial bin ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but still higher accuracy will be needed in the long term .    in our @xmath8-body and analytical calculations ,",
    "we use hod parameters for sdss galaxy samples with absolute - magnitude limits @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite for purposes of illustration . ; more generally , these thresholds correspond to @xmath65 . ] the results presented in   [ sec : dep ] therefore yield predictions of the weak lensing signal for these galaxy samples as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "to test the validity of our @xmath8-body method for calculating galaxy - galaxy lensing predictions ( see   [ sec : numerical ] ) , we first examine an sph simulation of a @xmath66cdm ( inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ) universe .",
    "this simulation is described in detail by @xcite , who , among other things , present predicted galaxy - matter correlations and compare them to recent observations .",
    "here we want to know whether the individual dark matter subhalos retained by baryonic galaxies in groups and clusters make an important contribution to the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal .    in brief , the simulation uses parallel treesph @xcite to model a @xmath67 comoving cube with @xmath68 dark matter particles and @xmath68 gas particles .",

    "radiative cooling leads to the formation of dense baryonic clumps @xcite , which form stars according to the algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "galaxies are identified by applying the skid ( spline - kernel interpolated denmax ; see @xcite ) algorithm to the population of stars and cold , dense gas particles .",
    "tests with simulations of varying resolution show that the simulated galaxy population is complete above a baryonic mass ( stars plus cold , dense gas ) of @xmath7664 @xmath77 , corresponding to @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) for this simulation .",
    "the space density of galaxies above this mass threshold is @xmath80 , corresponding to that of observed galaxies with @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we use this mass - thresholded galaxy sample for the tests below .",
    "we identify dark matter halos by applying the friends - of - friends algorithm ( fof ; @xcite ) to the dark matter particle distribution , with a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation , or @xmath83 .",
    "we associate each sph galaxy with the halo containing the dark matter particle closest to its center of mass . to create `` populated halo '' galaxy catalogs",
    ", we replace the sph galaxies in each halo with an equal number of artificial galaxies positioned on dark matter particles . the first `` central '' galaxy of each occupied halo is placed at the location of the dark matter particle with lowest potential energy ( computed using only halo members ) . any additional ,",
    "`` satellite '' galaxies are placed on randomly selected dark matter particles .",
    "satellites therefore follow the radial profile of dark matter within each halo , while any detailed association between satellites and the centers of dark matter subhalos is erased .",
    "the left panels of figure  [ fig : sph ] compare the galaxy - galaxy correlation functions , galaxy - matter correlation functions , and excess surface density profiles of the sph galaxies and the populated halo galaxy catalogs .",
    "results for the populated halos are an average over 10 realizations of the galaxy locations , and error bars show the dispersion among the ten realizations .",
    "( note that these do _ not _ represent the uncertainty on the mean , which would be a factor of three smaller , and they do not include the uncertainty owing to the finite simulation volume , since we are comparing galaxy catalogs in the same volume ) .",
    "the galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - matter correlations of the two catalogs are very similar at @xmath84 , while at smaller separations the populated halo catalog has correlations that are stronger by up to 20% .",
    "the excess surface density profile is calculated by directly counting galaxy - dark matter particle pairs in projection to compute @xmath27 and @xmath85 , not by integrating the three - dimensional @xmath10 .",
    "we count all projected pairs through the @xmath67 box and average results from the three orthogonal projections of the box ; noise from uncorrelated foreground and background particles cancels out because we have many galaxy targets .",
    "relative to the sph galaxy catalog , @xmath0 for the populated halo catalog starts about 10% low , rises to 10% above at @xmath86 , then agrees closely beyond @xmath87 .",
    "the modest deviations between the sph galaxy and populated halo results could reflect either the impact of satellite subhalos or differences between the radial profiles of sph satellites and dark matter . to separate the two effects",
    ", we adopt a different method of populating halos that ensures identical radial profiles , by placing each satellite at the radial distance of the corresponding sph satellite but choosing a random orientation for the radius vector .",
    "results are shown on the right panels of figure  [ fig : sph ] .",
    "the differences in @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath0 are greatly reduced , demonstrating that they arise mainly from the different radial profiles of sph satellite galaxies and dark matter ; specifically , the sph satellites are less concentrated towards the halo center than the dark matter . with matched radial profiles , the populated halos still have slightly larger @xmath10 at @xmath88 , in part because there are usually offsets of this magnitude between the location of the sph central galaxy and the position of the most bound dark matter particle .",
    "however , the differences in @xmath0 are now smaller than 10% at all @xmath19 .",
    "we conclude that it is safe to ignore the subhalos of individual satellite galaxies when computing @xmath0 for a full galaxy sample . indeed",
    ", the remaining residuals in figure  [ fig : sph ] , a consequence of the central galaxy offsets mentioned above , are opposite in sign to those expected from satellite subhalos .",
    "satellites in the sph simulation @xmath89 reside in individual dark matter subhalos @xcite , but these are tidally truncated , and at small separations @xmath0 is dominated by the contribution of the more numerous , central galaxies ( see   [ sec : dissection ] below ) .",
    "the small impact of satellite subhalos on @xmath0 is therefore unsurprising , and was anticipated by earlier analytic modeling @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , one might worry that the absence of @xmath90 subhalo signal in figure  [ fig : sph ] is an artifact of our simulation s finite mass resolution , leading to an artificially high degree of tidal truncation . to test this possibility , we compare results from this simulation to those of a simulation of the same cosmological model with a factor of eight higher mass resolution but smaller volume",
    ". this simulation uses 128@xmath91 dark matter particles and 128@xmath91 gas particles in a volume @xmath92 on a side .",
    "in each simulation , we select all halos in the mass range @xmath93 and measure the galaxy - matter correlation function for @xmath94 in these halos above the baryonic mass threshold of the larger volume , lower resolution simulation .",
    "the @xmath67 box contains 78 halos and 188 satellite galaxies satisfying these cuts , while the @xmath92 box contains 12 halos and 33 satellites .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sub ] , the satellite galaxy - matter correlations are equal in the two simulations to within the statistical errors , which are estimated by bootstrap resampling of the galaxies in the smaller simulation . the average mass profiles around satellites are therefore robust over a factor of eight in mass resolution .",
    "standard hod calculations assume that the halo occupation function @xmath55 has no direct dependence on a halo s larger scale environment .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the excursion set derivation of the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite , which , in its simplest form , predicts that a halo s formation history is uncorrelated with its environment at fixed mass @xcite .",
    "the correlation of galaxy properties with large scale environment emerges indirectly from the correlation with halo mass because high mass halos are more common in dense environments .",
    "@xcite showed that the observed correlation of red galaxy fraction with overdensity measured at @xmath95 is entirely accounted for by the correlation with overdensity measured at the @xmath96 scale characteristic of individual large halos .",
    "however , while early @xmath8-body studies showed at most weak correlations between halo formation time and environment at fixed mass for halos with @xmath97 @xcite , @xcite have recently shown that there is a much stronger correlation for lower mass halos , with the older halos being more strongly clustered ( see also @xcite discuss the potential origin of environmental correlations in the excursion set formalism ) .",
    "@xcite , examining the same sph simulation and galaxy sample that we have used here , showed that the mean number of galaxies as a function of halo mass , @xmath98 , is independent of halo environment within the statistical uncertainties imposed by the finite simulation volume .",
    "however , in light of gao et al.s ( 2005 ) result , we have carried out an experiment to explicitly examine the possible impact of environmental dependence of @xmath55 on galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - matter correlations .    in the populated halo calculations shown in figure  [ fig : sph ] ,",
    "the number of galaxies assigned to each halo is equal to the number of sph galaxies , so any environmental dependence predicted by the sph simulation is also built into the populated halo distribution .",
    "we eliminate the environmental dependence by shuffling the galaxy populations among halos of similar mass . specifically , we sort the halos by mass and replace the number of galaxies @xmath99 in the halo of rank @xmath100 with the number @xmath101 in halo @xmath102 , then recalculate @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath0 , averaging over ten realizations of galaxy positions @xmath103 halos .",
    "we repeat the exercise with the substitutions @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 so that we can average over four different halo shufflings and compute the statistical error on the mean .",
    "the sampling of the halo mass function is sparse for the highest mass halos in the simulation , so at high masses we can not exchange the galaxy contents of halos without significantly changing @xmath55 itself .",
    "we therefore keep the galaxy populations of the @xmath107 most massive halos fixed , with @xmath108 or 20 . for @xmath108 , we are shuffling the contents of all halos with @xmath109 , and for @xmath110 we are shuffling the contents of all halos with @xmath111 .",
    "= 3.6truein    figure  [ fig : gao ] plots the fractional difference in @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath0 between the shuffled halo realizations and the original populated halos .",
    "we use the populated halos as the comparison standard rather than the sph galaxies so that we can isolate the impact of environmental dependence of @xmath55 .",
    "error bars show the error on the mean from the four shufflings , but recall that we have only one realization of the original populated halos . for @xmath108 , there is a 5% increase on @xmath1 at @xmath112 . however",
    ", these scales lie in the 1-halo regime where environmental variation of @xmath55 should have no impact at all , so the increase is probably a statistical fluctuation that reflects the particular sizes and concentrations of the halos present in the simulation .",
    "it is only slightly larger than the 1@xmath113 error bars , and the errors from point to point are highly correlated . for @xmath110 ,",
    "the changes in @xmath1 are less than 3% over the range @xmath114 .",
    "the three points at @xmath115 are depressed by @xmath116 on average , which suggests that shuffling may slightly lower the large scale galaxy bias factor , but the statistical significance of this depression is difficult to assess with a single @xmath67 simulation .",
    "shuffling changes @xmath10 by less than 5% , usually much less , except for the largest scale point with @xmath108 .",
    "most significantly for our present purposes , the changes in @xmath0 are at most @xmath117 for @xmath110 at all scales , and only slightly larger for @xmath108 .",
    "we conclude that ignoring any possible environmental dependence of @xmath55 has minimal impact on the calculation of galaxy - galaxy lensing observables for a given cosmology and hod , for a galaxy sample defined by a threshold in baryonic mass .",
    "there could be a few percent effect on the large scale bias of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function , which might lead to small errors in inferring the hod from observations of @xmath1 .",
    "assessing the importance of this effect will require larger simulations .",
    "@xcite have carried out a similar shuffling experiment for semi - analytic galaxy populations in the @xmath118 millennium run simulation @xcite , and they find few percent changes in large scale bias for galaxy samples defined by thresholds in mass or absolute magnitude ( it was the hearing about their shuffling experiment that inspired us to carry out our own ) .",

    "we have not yet explored more general parametrizations , but we expect that the @xmath0 predictions would be robust at this level for all hod models that fit the observed @xmath58 .",
    "galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements are often made for flux - limited samples rather than absolute - magnitude limited samples to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , but such measurements are difficult to interpret quantitatively because they do not represent properties of a uniformly defined galaxy population .",
    "because our predictions apply on the non - linear scales where the measurement precision is higher , and because results from different radii can be combined , it should be possible to obtain precise constraints on @xmath40 from absolute magnitude - limited samples , and to use different samples to check for consistency .",
    "since the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 vary with scale , it is possible in principle to break the degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , the deviations from linear scaling are not large , so while @xmath40 should be well constrained , individual parameter constraints are likely to be imprecise and sensitive to systematic uncertainties in the modeling .",
    "@xcite have recently presented sdss measurements for narrow bins of luminosity and of stellar mass , which are well suited to their goal of constraining halo virial masses and satellite fractions . for cosmological parameter constraints ,",
    "we think it is better to use luminosity or mass - threshold samples , which provide higher signal - to - noise ratio , and which are easier to model robustly because there is no @xmath288 mass cutoff on @xmath289 .",

    "we have used the analytic model to investigate the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath3 and @xmath2 when hod parameters are chosen to reproduce the observational space density and projected correlation function @xmath58 of the galaxy sample being measured .",
    "our main findings are as follows :    \\1 . in our sph simulation , replacing the satellite galaxies of each halo with randomly selected dark matter particles has a 10@xmath22520% effect on @xmath1 and @xmath10 at scales @xmath86 , and smaller impact at other scales .",
    "most of this difference arises from the differing radial profiles of satellite galaxies and dark matter . if satellites are replaced in a way that preserves the radial profile but randomizes azimuthal positions , then changes to @xmath1 and @xmath10 are @xmath290 at all radii , and changes to @xmath0 are @xmath291 .",
    "dark matter subhalos around individual satellites orbiting in larger halos are present , but they have negligible impact on the global @xmath0",
    "if we randomly reassign the galaxy occupation number of each halo with @xmath111 to another halo of nearly equal mass , then changes to @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath0 are @xmath292 at all @xmath293 .",
    "this result implies that any environmental dependence of the halo occupation function @xmath55 at fixed halo mass has minimal impact on these statistics for our simulated galaxy sample , which is defined by a baryonic mass threshold . for our largest scale point at @xmath294",
    ", we find an effect of 10% on @xmath1 , 5% on @xmath10 , and 2% on @xmath0 , but the statistical uncertainties of our estimate are of comparable magnitude at this scale , so larger simulation volumes are needed to definitively establish the impact of any environmental dependence on the large scale bias factor . taken together ,",
    "results  1 and 2 show that the @xmath1 and @xmath0 predictions of a full hydrodynamic simulation can be reproduced to 5% or better ( usually much better ) by populating the halos of a pure @xmath8-body simulation with the correct @xmath55 , provided that satellite galaxy populations have the correct radial profiles .",
    "\\3 . our analytic model for @xmath0",
    "is based on the methods introduced by @xcite and @xcite , but it incorporates the scale - dependent halo bias and ellipsoidal halo exclusion corrections introduced by @xcite and @xcite for @xmath1 calculations .",
    "we have tested the analytic model against numerical results from a grid of populated @xmath8-body simulations , which span the parameter range @xmath193 and @xmath295 , with hod parameters chosen to match the space density and projected correlation function of sdss galaxy with @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the analytic model reproduces the numerical results to 5% or better over the range of @xmath260 .",
    "the residuals are consistent with the statistical errors of the numerical calculations , except for the innermost bin , where gravitational force softening in the @xmath8-body simulations artificially suppresses correlations .    \\4 . for",
    "the @xmath63 hod parameters , pairs involving at least one central galaxy dominate the galaxy - galaxy correlation function at @xmath218 and @xmath219 . in the range @xmath296 ,",
    "satellite - satellite pairs in large halos make the dominant contribution to @xmath1 . in similar fashion ,",
    "central galaxies dominate the galaxy - matter correlation function at small and large separations , while satellite galaxies dominate in the range @xmath297 .",
    "the halos of individual satellites make negligible contribution to @xmath0 because they are usually tidally truncated below the scales at which the satellite contribution itself is important .    \\5 . for samples with hod parameters chosen to match the @xmath64 sdss sample of @xcite ,",
    "the ratio @xmath267 is constant at @xmath298 , as predicted by the linear bias model , but it jumps by 20@xmath22550% at scales @xmath87 near the transition from the 1-halo to 2-halo clustering regime , before settling to a new , higher value at small scales .",
    "the magnitude of the jump depends on @xmath3 , and it is likely to depend on the galaxy sample as well , being stronger for more highly clustered populations . in linear bias terms , the large scale values of @xmath267 correspond to a galaxy - matter cross - correlation coefficient @xmath270 , if we define the bias factor @xmath299^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "we fit the dependence of @xmath0 on cosmological parameters with a scaling formula @xmath300 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are slowly varying functions of @xmath19 .",
    "this scaling describes the results of our full analytic model with rms error @xmath301 over the parameter range @xmath302 , @xmath303 . at large scales ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 approach the linear bias values @xmath15 .",
    "however , forcing @xmath15 at all scales leads to errors that are larger by factors of @xmath304 , relative to the scaling formula  ( [ eq : rel ] ) with our fitted values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "table  [ tab : delta ] lists our predicted values of @xmath0 for the @xmath63 and @xmath64 sdss samples , assuming our fiducial cosmological model with @xmath50 and @xmath202 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rel ] ) allows scaling of these results to other values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and measurements of @xmath0 for these samples can be combined with these predictions to obtain cosmological constraints , which will be tightest on a parameter combination that is approximately @xmath40 .",
    "given the growth of the sdss since the samples analyzed by @xcite and @xcite , it is probably preferable to extract @xmath58 and @xmath0 estimates for matched galaxy samples from the latest data sets .",
    "a full analysis should also investigate the effects of adding greater flexibility to the hod parametrization itself , using , e.g. , the 5-parameter formulation of @xcite .",
    "we have tested the effect of changing to a different 3-parameter description ( see   [ sec : dep ] ) , and we find changes of @xmath305 in the @xmath0 predictions .",
    "we suspect that these predictions would remain similar for any choice of hod parameters that reproduces the observed @xmath58 .",
    "our sph and @xmath8-body tests indicate that the analytic model predictions should be accurate to 5% or better given our hod parametrization , though assumptions about galaxy profile concentrations have significant effect at @xmath266 .",
