    "thirty years after its discovery in gaas - algaas heterojunctions @xcite , the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) still remains to be the topic of current research , as nowadays this former solid - state phenomenon is re - discovered within the scope of quantum gases in two dimensions . proposals to achieve the crucial ingredient , a perpendicular magnetic field , within such systems of neutral particles are at hand : conceptually the simplest of them is a rotation of the system @xcite , where the strength of the artificial magnetic field can be tuned by the frequency of rotation .",
    "however , addressing the regime where only the lowest landau level ( lll ) is occupied , and at the same time guaranteeing stability of the atomic cloud requires a delicate balance between rotation and trap frequency , making an experimental realization of this proposal extremely hard .    an alternative way which circumvents",
    "this problem is to generate artificial fields by implementing a laser - assisted tunneling scheme within an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the idea is that during a hopping process stimulated by a laser field , the atom picks up the phase of the laser , which effectively simulates the action of a magnetic vector potential . in a very similar way",
    ", a @xmath0 berry phase mimicking a gauge field can be inscribed into continuous systems via atom - laser coupling @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the coupling involves more than two atomic states , it is possible to create a space - dependent degenerate subspace , which can be understood in terms of a non - abelian berry phase communicating between the degenerate atomic states . in this way , the atom - laser coupling scheme is generalized for synthesizing also non - abelian gauge fields @xcite . the same can be achieved in optical lattices , if the laser - assisted tunneling is made sensitive on an additional , internal degree of freedom of the atoms @xcite .",
    "these new possibilities have directed the attention to fqhe in such non - abelian scenarios @xcite .",
    "the practical feasibility of using lasers to implement artificial magnetic fields has been shown in pioneering experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , very recently the implementation of spin - orbit coupling within a bose - einstein condensate can be considered an @xmath1 gauge field realized in cold atoms @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for seeking new realizations of the old fractional quantum hall effect is given by the intriguing quasiparticles which occur as the excitations of fractional quantum hall systems : being neither bosons nor fermions , these so - called anyons behave exotically under interchange @xcite , as instead of gaining simply a sign factor , a phase is obtained , which in degenerate anyonic systems may even be an element of some non - abelian group . due to this property , together with their topological and thus robust nature , quantum hall states are especially interesting for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "it is therefore most relevant to find fractional quantum hall systems , where a large energy gap separating the ground state from the excited states guarantees a high degree of robustness .",
    "considering dipolar atoms in a rotating trap , ref .",
    "@xcite claims to have achieved this . in this paper",
    ", we consider once again this scenario and find a much smaller gap .",
    "this finding directs our attention to the question if a robust fqhe might instead be realizable in a non - abelian environment . from refs .",
    "@xcite it is known that in non - interacting systems the non - abelian gauge field strongly influences the nature of the integer quantum hall effect . by choosing an anisotropic field configuration it becomes possible to squeeze the landau levels .",
    "applying to such a squeezed scenario the thermodynamic approximation @xcite used in the abelian case in ref .",
    "@xcite , we show in this paper , that a dramatic increase of the energy gap can be achieved .    as in dipolar systems it turns out that the gap crucially depend on how it is defined , we first discuss this matter in section [ ii ] , which we conclude with a precise definition of the gap .",
    "subsequently , we describe in section [ ii ] an analytic approximation allowing to evaluate this gap in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "section [ iii ] is dedicated to specifying the gauge potential . here",
    "we show that abelian and non - abelian fields can be treated on the same footing .",
    "finally , the concrete calculation and its results are described in section [ iv ] .",
    "the physics of non - interacting particles confined to a plane under the influence of a perpendicular magnetic field is understood in terms of the quantized landau levels .",
    "while this scenario may give rise to an integer quantum hall effect , the fqhe requires repulsive interactions between the particles as its crucial ingredient . in the context of fqhe as a solid - state phenomenon ,",
    "almost exclusively coulomb interactions have been considered . for neutral fermions , however , it is most likely to have dipolar interactions .",
    "we therefore study the following hamiltonian ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath3   ^{2 } + \\sum_{j < k}^{n } v_{\\mathrm{dd}}(\\vec{r}_{j},\\vec{r}_{k}).\\ ] ] here @xmath4 is the mass of the particles and @xmath5 the dipolar interaction between the particles with dipolar moment @xmath6 .",
    "the gauge potential @xmath7 is supposed to describe a constant gauge field perpendicular to the two - dimensional system , and will be specified in section [ iii ] .",
    "it is known that for practically any repulsive interaction a very good trial wave function for the ground - state is the so - called laughlin function @xcite , which can be found by filling the lowest landau level up to a filling factor @xmath8 @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the positions of the particles , @xmath11 is a normalization factor , and @xmath12 is the magnetic length corresponding to a magnetic field of strength @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath14 is odd , the function is fully antisymmetric and thus describes fermionic systems , while the opposite is true for even @xmath14 .",
    "the laughlin ground - state can be considered a homogeneous liquid state .",
    "it is excited by piercing a hole into it .",
    "choosing for simplicity the quasihole to be at the origin , the excited state is described by @xmath15 with @xmath16 a normalization factor .    a gap , vaguely defined as the energy difference separating the laughlin state from the quasihole state , guarantees the robustness of the fqhe .",
    "but as one may think of different ways of creating a quasihole , it is important to be precise in the definition . in a finite system ,",
    "a quasihole can be created in three different ways @xcite :    \\(i ) by reducing the particle number ,    \\(ii ) by increasing the area of the system at constant particle number ,    \\(iii ) by changing the magnetic field at constant particle number and constant area .    in the electronic system , in addition to the coulomb repulsion between the electrons , a positively charged background ( originated from ions ) is present as a consequence of the electroneutrality of the system .",
    "the corresponding background potential stabilizes the coulomb system , but it also adds to the energy of the quasihole , compensating the losses in the energy of the direct electron - electron coulomb interaction due to lowering the number of electrons or their density . as a result , for any choice of the definition a positive energy gap is obtained @xcite .",
    "contrary to the electron case , dipolar systems have no such background potential , and the definition of the gap is crucial . as we will explicitly see in section [ iv ] , energy gaps  defined according to ( i ) or ( ii ) have a negative sign .",
    "this would mean that the system is unstable against the creation of quasiholes .",
    "in fact , this , at first view , counter - intuitive result is not astonishing : since ( i ) and ( ii ) results in diluting the system and , therefore , in lowering the potential energy , it is obvious that in these cases we should find an energy gain .",
    "therefore , the only meaningful definition for the energy gap in a dipolar system is according to ( iii ) , where we compare the energy of a quasihole with the ground state energy of the system with the same number of particles occupying the same area - similar to the definition of the quasihole excitation energy in a normal fermi system .",
    "in order to evaluate the gap , we follow an approach developed in refs . @xcite . based on the plasma analogy @xcite , relating the physics of the laughlin state to the one of a classical one - component plasma , analytic expressions for the correlation functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the laughlin state and the quasihole state",
    "can be derived :    @xmath19,\\\\ \\label{f } f_{j , k}(z_1 , z_2)&=\\frac{z_1z_2}{2 } \\sum_{r=0}^{j}\\sum_{s=0}^{k } { j \\choose r}{k \\choose s } \\frac{(-1)^r z_1^{r+s } z_2^{j+k-(r+s)}}{\\sqrt{(r+s+1)(j+k+1-(r+s))}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that in these expressions , the quasihole state is related to the laughlin state by reducing the particle density in the center of a thermodynamically large system , which according to the classification of the previous section is a quasihole of type ( i ) .",
    "given these expressions , we may evaluate the energy difference @xmath20 between these two states by solving the following integral @xmath21 .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    fortunately , we are able to derive a relation between the quantity from eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) and the gap related to a quasihole state according to ( iii ) .",
    "first , we notice that @xmath22 , where these are the energies of @xmath23 particles in a quasihole state , and @xmath24 particles in the laughlin state .",
    "now we may write @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the energy of one particle in the laughlin state .",
    "this quantity can readily be evaluated by substituting @xmath27 in @xmath28 and @xmath29 in @xmath30 , and integrating : @xmath31    demanding a constant particle number , we may re - define the gap as @xmath32    this definition describes a quasihole created according to ( ii ) . however , as argued in the previous section , apart from a fixed particle number , we should also demand a fixed volume .",
    "therefore we notice that each landau state occupies an area @xmath33 . for the laughlin state with @xmath24 particles to occupy the same area as the quasihole state with @xmath24 particles and one quasihole",
    ", we thus have to modify the magnetic length @xmath34 of the excited state according to : @xmath35 now we have to note that the energies in the dipolar system scale with @xmath36 .",
    "since we wish to compare states at different magnetic fields , we define the gap at constant particle number and constant volume as : @xmath37 by noticing that @xmath38 and approximating @xmath39 for large @xmath24 , we find with eq .",
    "( [ frac ] ) : @xmath40 before we calculate this quantity , we discuss different gauge potentials that might be realized .",
    "for the discussion of fqhe , it is feasible to choose a symmetric gauge for the gauge field . a perpendicular , magnetic field of strength @xmath13",
    "is then described by the magnetic vector potential @xmath41 . in the context of artificial fields , it is possible to generalize this potential to be an element of @xmath1 .",
    "we choose it to have the form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are additional , controllable parameters , and @xmath45 are pauli matrices .",
    "proposals to realize such gauge potentials have been made both for lattice systems @xcite and for trapped gases coupled to laser fields @xcite .",
    "( [ a ] ) contains the limit of a magnetic field , as can be seen by choosing @xmath46 . for finite @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the potential ( [ a ] ) yields a constant non - abelian gauge field perpendicular to the system . for the isotropic configuration @xmath47",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this potential splits the landau levels , which , by assuming a short - range repulsion between the particles , may give rise to a fqhe with non - abelian anyons . the most general configuration with @xmath48 has been considered for non - interacting lattice systems in ref . @xcite .",
    "then the @xmath1 gauge potential produces an anisotropic space - time . giving rise to dirac points in the bandstructure of the free system",
    ", we may measure this anisotropy as the ratio of the sound velocities in @xmath49- and @xmath50-direction : @xmath51 and replacing the original variable @xmath52 by squeezed one @xmath53 : @xmath54 \\rightarrow\\big [ \\tilde z(\\xi ) \\equiv\\cosh\\xi\\ z - \\sinh\\xi\\ \\bar z \\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we are then able to treat both the abelian scenario and the non - abelian scenario on the same footing : the generalization of the laughlin wavefunction and the quasihole wavefunction , eqs .",
    "( [ psilaugh ] ) and ( [ psiqh ] ) , to systems with a non - abelian field are straightforwardly given by making the replacement eq .",
    "( [ squeeze ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the correlation functions derived for the states eqs .",
    "( [ psilaugh ] ) and ( [ psiqh ] ) , also hold for the corresponding squeezed states , if we again make the substitution eq .",

    "( [ delta ] ) can then be evaluated by the integral @xmath55 .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the same way , we generalize the ground - state energy defined in eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) to be a function @xmath56 of the squeezing . following the derivation as in section [ ii ]",
    ", we finally arrive at the equation @xmath57 .",
    "while in the abelian scenario with @xmath58 parts of the calculation can be done analytically , the squeezed scenario is more complicated as it demands a fully numerical treatment . since in both cases",
    "the steps of the calculation are the same , we describe in details only the procedure for the abelian case .",
    "the main difficulty consists in evaluating the integral eq .",
    "[ delta ] .",
    "first we have to specify the coefficients @xmath59 in eqs .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) and ( [ gqh ] ) .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that by setting all @xmath60 , a system with a completely filled landau level is described , @xmath61 . for this choice of @xmath59 ,",
    "the resulting correlation functions are denoted by @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in order to have a fqhe",
    ", we need a fractional filling , @xmath64 , which requires the coefficients @xmath59 with @xmath65 to be non - zero . for fermions ,",
    "the most robust effect is expected for @xmath66 , where the choice @xmath67 and @xmath68 is best suited .",
    "we call the corresponding correlation functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and also define for convenience the differences @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    turning now to the integral eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) with @xmath73 , we note that in the abelian limit it reduces to the one considered in ref . @xcite . as our numerical result",
    ", however , drastically differs from ref .",
    "@xcite , a careful analysis is of order .",
    "therefore we split the integral eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) into two parts , @xmath74 , which is analytically solvable , and @xmath75 , which we treat numerically .",
    "for the analytic part we find @xmath76 .",
    "note that for @xmath61 , this negative number would be the full , completely analytic result for the energy difference @xmath20 defined in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) .",
    "this clearly shows what we have anticipated in section [ ii ] , namely that this definition is not the appropriate one for the energy gap in a dipolar system .",
    "before we evaluate @xmath77 numerically , we examine the asymptotic behavior of the integrand . as the divergence in the interaction term for @xmath78",
    "is compensated by the vanishing of the correlations , this limit can easily be handled by a regularization of the integral .",
    "the limit of @xmath79 , however , turns out to be problematic : for finite particle distance , @xmath80 , this contribution is not suppressed by the interaction , and the convergence of the integral eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) requires that @xmath81 and @xmath82 have the same asymptotic behavior .",
    "however , the completely different structure of both functions obscure the latter .",
    "contrariwise , we should note that if we truncate the infinite sum in @xmath83 , this expression gets exponentially damped for large center - of - mass coordinates , while @xmath81 depends only on the relative coordinates , yielding @xmath84 for @xmath85 .    to circumvent this problem",
    ", we bring @xmath81 to a form similar as @xmath83 , which is possible by factoring out a damping @xmath86 $ ] and taylor expanding the remaining exponential @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "we are then able to write @xmath88 as now each term in both @xmath81 and @xmath83 is damped by a factor @xmath86 $ ] , they all vanish in the limit @xmath85 , and we may truncate the infinite sums at a sufficiently large value of @xmath89 . note that due to the different orders in @xmath90 and @xmath91 of @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) and @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) , the sum in @xmath81 should contain two more terms than the sum in @xmath83 for a quick convergence .",
    "now we are able to perform the numerical integration .",
    "the error due to the truncation still is @xmath94 for 10 terms , but can be minimized by a finite - size analysis of our results .",
    "we then find @xmath95 , where the numerical error has been approximated by the deviation from the smooth fit in fig .",
    "[ gap ] . with this , we find @xmath96 . as we have argued in section [ ii ] , this negative value is due to the reduced density of the system .",
    "we continue with calculating the gap as defined in eq .",
    "( [ delta_n ] ) .",
    "therefore we have to evaluate the integral eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) , which in the isotropic case , @xmath58 , reads @xmath97 , from which we find that also @xmath98 .",
    "the negative values for @xmath99 can be understood by noticing that as the particle taken away at the origin now has been added at the edge of the system increasing its volume , so @xmath99 corresponds to the energy of a quasihole according to ( ii ) .",
    "as long as such a process is possible , the system is unstable as it tries to reduce its density by diluting .",
    "finally , we turn to definition eq .",
    "( [ delta_v ] ) . only in this case",
    ", we obtain a positive gap , @xmath100 , which however is much smaller than the number found in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath101 , but compares well with the gap obtained via exact diagonalization of a small dipolar system in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the discrepancy to ref .",
    "@xcite has been attributed to the different system size .     at constant volume and constant particle number as a function of the squeezing parameter @xmath102 :",
    "the dots are obtained by a numerical evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) for different @xmath102 , a fit of this data yields the solid line.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    repeating this procedure for finite squeezing @xmath102 , we have to evaluate @xmath103 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ delta2 ] ) , but now the whole integral has to be solved numerically .",
    "again we find negative values for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which even decrease with larger @xmath102 .",
    "however , as also the ground - state energy @xmath56 increases with @xmath102 , the gap @xmath105 at constant particle number and constant volume finally has a positive balance for all @xmath102 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ gap ] , it increases with @xmath102 , and a convenient fit to the numerical data is found to be : @xmath106 we obtain @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "to understand this behavior , we note that the squeezing allows the particles to get closer in one direction , while the particle distance is increased in the other direction . due to @xmath109 behavior of the dipole - dipole interaction ,",
    "the interaction energy is much more sensitive to changes of the density distribution at short distances rather than at large ones .",
    "thus , compressing in one direction and stretching in another one increases the interaction energy . as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ delta_v ] ) , this gives rise to a bigger energy gap .",
    "summarizing this work , we have shown that dramatically differing from the predictions in ref .",
    "@xcite , only a small energy gap separates the laughlin state from quasihole excitations in systems of dipolar quantum gases with artificial magnetic fields .",
    "however , by considering scenarios where a non - abelian gauge field introduces an anisotropy into the system , an exponential increase of the gap can be achieved , and may allow for robust fractional quantum hall states .",
