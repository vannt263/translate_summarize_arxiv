    "in daily socio - economic network systems , many commodities , passengers , or information fragments ( abstractly referred to as _ packets _ in this paper ) are delivered from one place to another place . in general , it is expected to send and receive packets as quickly as possible without encountering traffic congestion which would force packets to wait at nodes . even if packets are concentrated ( or _ condensed _ in term of statistical physics ) on just a few nodes in some parts of a network , this situation may cause congestion over the network . thus , one of the important issues is a routing strategy : how to select a forwarding node in the neighbors of the resident node of a packet . since the efficiency of transportation or communication depends on not only routing strategy , but also on network topology",
    ", we should consider a realistic problem setting for the routing and the topology .",
    "in addition , considering the interaction of accumulated packets in a buffer ( called _ queue _ ) at each node is necessary , since it crucially affects the traffic flow on a network .",
    "this paper discusses traffic properties that depend on routing strategies in the interaction of packets on a realistic network topology .    during this decade , a new research field , _ complex network science _",
    ", has been created @xcite , since a common topological structure called _ scale - free _ ( sf ) was found to exist in many real networks such as the internet , the world - wide - web , power grids , airline networks , social collaboration networks , human sexual contacts , and biological metabolic pathways , etc .",
    "the sf structure is characterized by the property that the distribution of degree ( the number of connections to a node ) follows a power - law .",
    "in other words , the network consists of many nodes with low degrees and a few hubs with high degrees .",
    "moreover , a sf network naturally emerges in social acquaintance relationships or peer - to - peer communications , and it has short paths compared with large network size ( the total number of nodes ) .    in a realistic sf network , a routing path is shortened by passing through hubs for the forwarding of a packet .",
    "however , many packets may be concentrated at the hubs @xcite , in whose queues the packets are cumulatively stored if they arrive in a quantity larger than the processing limit for forwarding . in such a situation , there exists a trade - off between delivering packets on a short path and avoiding traffic congestion . to improve communication efficiency even in a dynamic environment for a wireless or ad hoc network ,",
    "various routing schemes are being developed . because , in an ad hoc network , many nodes ( such as base stations or communication sites ) and connections between them are likely to change over time , then global information , e.g. , a routing table in the internet , can not be applied . in early work , some decentralized routing developed to reduce energy consumption in sensor or mobile networks , however they lead to the failure of guaranteed delivery @xcite ; in the flooding algorithm , multiple redundant copies of a message are sent and cause congestion , while greedy and compass routing may occasionally fall into infinite loops or into a dead end .",
    "thus , we focus on stochastic routing methods using only local information with respect to the resident node of a packet and to the connected neighbors on a path , due to their simplicity and power .",
    "if the terminal node of a packet is included in the neighbors of the resident node , then the packet is deterministically sent to the terminal in order to guarantee reachability unless the connectivity is broken .",
    "we call this neighbor search ( or n - search ) only at the last step to the terminal . note that the development of stochastic routing methods is still in progress depending on device and information processing technologies .",
    "although we suppose a mixture of wireless and wired communications in future networks , first of all , we aim to understand the relations for traffic properties between fixed network topology and routing methods . here , it is usually assumed for simplicity that each node has the same performance in the forwarding of packets .",
    "the enhancement of performance in forwarding is also reasonable @xcite .",
    "for example , in the internet or airline networks , an important facility with many connections has high performance ; more packets or flights are processed as the incoming flux of communication requests or of passengers increases . such higher performance at more busy nodes is effectively applied in a _ zero - range process _ ( zrp ) @xcite , which tends to distribute packets throughout the whole network , instead of avoiding paths through hubs .    in this paper , from the random walk version ,",
    "we extend the zrp on a sf network to the degree - dependent hopping rule , which parametrically controls routing strategies in the trade - off between the selection of a short path passing through hubs , and the avoidance of hubs at which many packets are condensed and wait in queues for a long time .",
    "the above models in statistical physics are useful for the analysis of complex phenomena involved in transition form a free - flow phase to a congestion phase , or the opposite transition .",
    "most research on traffic congestion rely on numerical simulations .",
    "although a few other theoretical analyses based on the mean - field approximation @xcite have been done , we can not compare them to the zrp , simply because of different problem settings .",
    "thus , we consider a combination of settings as modified traffic models , and numerically investigate them .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we briefly review the related models in recent studies . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we introduce a stochastic packet transfer model defined by the zrp , in which all packets persist without any generation and removals . then , in terms of fundamental properties , we approximately analyze the stationary probability of incoming packets at each node on sf networks , and derive the phase transition for condensation of packets at hubs in the degree - dependent hopping rule . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we numerically confirm the phase transition , and as a new result , show the trade - off between a detour wandering path and long wait at hubs .",
    "moreover , we discuss the congestion phenomenon in the modified traffic models with packet generation . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we summarize these results and describe some issues for further research .",
    "many traffic models have been proposed in various problem settings for routing , node capacity , and packet generation .",
    "they are summarized in table [ table_models ] .",
    "the basic processes for packet transfer consist of the selection of a forwarding ( coming - in ) node and the jumping - out of packets in the node capacity . in these models",
    "( including our model discussed later ) , a significant issue commonly arises from the trade - off between delivering packets on a shorter path and avoiding the congestion caused by a concentration of packets on a few nodes such as hubs .    in the typical models ,",
    "a forwarding node @xmath7 is chosen with probability either @xmath8 @xcite or @xmath9 @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath10 are real parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the degree and the dynamically - occupied queue length by packets at node @xmath7 in the connected neighbors @xmath13 to the resident node @xmath14 of the packet .",
    "these methods are not based on a random walk ( selecting a forwarding node uniformly at random among the neighbors ) , but on the extensions ( including the uniformly random one at @xmath15 ) called preferential and congestion - aware walks , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath3 leads to a short path passing through hubs , and that @xmath2 and @xmath16 lead to the avoidance of hubs and congested nodes with large @xmath12 .",
    "in stochastic routing methods , instead of using the shortest path , the optimal values @xmath4 and @xmath17 for maximizing the generation rate of packets in a free - flow regime have been obtained by numerical simulations @xcite . a correlation between the congestion at node level and a betweenness centrality measure",
    "was suggested @xcite .",
    "other routing schemes @xcite have also been considered , taking into account lengths of both the routing path and of the queue . in a deterministic model @xcite ,",
    "a forwarding node @xmath7 is chosen among neighbors @xmath13 by minimizing the quantity @xmath18 with a weight @xmath19 , @xmath20 denoting the distance from @xmath7 to the terminal node . since we must solve the optimization problems , these models @xcite are not suitable for wireless or ad hoc communication networks .",
    "thus , stochastic routing methods using only local information are potentially promising . in a stochastic model @xcite",
    ", @xmath21 is chosen at random , and a packet at the top of its queue is sent with probability @xmath22 or refused with probability @xmath23 as a nondecreasing function of the queue length @xmath12 .",
    "this model is simplified by the assumption of a constant arrival rate of packets , for analyzing the critical point of traffic congestion in a mean - field equation @xcite .    with a different processing power at each node @xcite",
    ", it has also been considered that the node capacity @xmath24 is proportional to its degree @xmath25 , therefore more packets jump out from a node as the degree becomes larger .",
    "on the other hand , in the zrp @xcite , the forwarding capacity at a node depends on the number of @xmath26 defined as a queue length occupied by packets at node @xmath14 .",
    "the zrp is a solvable theoretical model for traffic dynamics .",
    "in particular , in the zrp with a random walk at @xmath6 , the phase transition between condensation of packets at hubs and uncondensation on sf networks has been derived @xcite . for @xmath3 ,",
    "a similar phase transition has been analyzed in the mean - field approximation @xcite .    in the next two sections , based on a straightforward approach introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , we derive the phase transition in the zrp on sf networks with the degree - dependent hopping rule for both @xmath3 and @xmath2 , inspired by preferential @xcite and congestion - aware walks .",
    "although the rule is not identical to the congestion - aware routing scheme @xcite based on occupied queue length @xmath12 , @xmath2 corresponds to avoiding hubs with large degrees , where many packets tend to be concentrated .",
