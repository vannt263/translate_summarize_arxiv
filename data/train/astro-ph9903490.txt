    "for certain areas of current astronomical research , such as the detection and mass determination of black holes in galactic nuclei , spatial resolution is the main limitation . for others ,",
    "e.g. the case of extrasolar planets , the challenge is to detect very faint signals in the presence of an overwhelmingly bright star .",
    "interferometry from space has the potential to overcome both of these obstacles : it has no fundamental limit to spatial resolution , and interferometric nulling is by far the most powerful method to suppress unwanted light from a bright point source",
    ".    the space interferometer mission ( sim ) will be the first mission to demonstrate the feasibility of this new and exciting technology .",
    "scheduled for launch in 2005 , sim is the first new mission of nasa s origins program after sirtf .",
    "it is designed primarily for astrometry at the -level .",
    "however , sim may also have significant capabilities for synthesis imaging . in terms of spatial resolution ,",
    "sim with a maximum baseline of 12  m promises at least a factor of six improvement over the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the potential of sim to significantly improve upon current observational limits in two specific astronomical cases , namely line - emitting gas disks rotating around black holes in galactic nuclei , and continuum zodiacal dust disks around nearby stars . in the next section , we will describe how sim performs synthesis imaging , and discuss some aspects and limitations that will affect the observations .",
    "section  [ simsim ] gives an overview of the capabilities of the code which we use to simulate various classes of model sources .",
    "input models and first results of simulations for the two examples mentioned above are described in sections  [ bh ] and [ exo ] .",
    "we discuss and summarize our findings in section  [ sum ] .",
    "appendices describe the basics of interferometric imaging , and the simulation of measurement errors in our models , respectively .",
    "as of november 1998 , certain aspects of sim design which are important for synthesis imaging have not yet been finalized .",
    "the most important of these is to have a sufficiently complete range of of baseline spacings available . for the purpose of this paper , we assume that sim will have baselines between 0.5 and 12  m in increments of 0.5  m , similar to the original design ( see @xcite for an overview ) . with these capabilities , sim will be well suited to perform reliable synthesis imaging for a wide range of complicated sources .",
    "the basic `` measurement '' for synthesis imaging consists of determining the amplitude and phase of the interference fringes for a given baseline and spacecraft orientation .",
    "these two quantities together form the `` complex visibility '' . in short ,",
    "the signal of the two interfering beams on the detector depends on the path difference or `` delay '' between them .",
    "the interference pattern is a cosine wave whose amplitude and phase are the desired observables . if the path delay is accurately known and controllable , the complex visibilty can be determined by `` scanning '' the delay . repeating this measurement for a large number of baselines then allows a more or less complete reconstruction of the sky brightness distribution , depending on its complexity . in appendix",
    "a we describe in more detail the operation of the interferometer in terms of fourier optics . here , we concentrate on the performance of sim for astronomical targets .      the relative length of the baseline vector is monitored and controlled with an internal laser metrology system , while its exact length and orientation are determined by observing nearby bright stars . pointing stability",
    "is achieved with two additional guide interferometers .",
    "the science interferometer is aligned such that the phase center ( zero delay , or white light fringe ) coincides with the position of a reference star .",
    "the delay lines are adjusted such that the phase center moves to the science target which has to lie in the 15  field of regard of sim . in the case of astrometric measurements of a point source _ position _ ,",
    "the only interesting observable is the delay needed to maximize the white light fringe .",
    "this determines the position of the source with respect to the reference star .",
    "identification of the white light fringe is unambiguous since the light is spectrally dispersed : only the central fringe will show no phase shift for all spectral channels .    in the case of an extended source that is to be imaged ,",
    "the complex visibility is measured with the delay modulation method ( @xcite ) or some variation thereof , which we describe in appendix b. since the signal is spectrally dispersed , the complex visibilities are measured simultaneously for all spectral channels .",
    "this is the basis for the spectral synthesis technique that we describe in section  [ specsyn ] .",
    "baseline length , orientation , and wavelength determine the -coordinate to which the complex visibility is assigned .",
    "the wavenumbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 are defined as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the baseline projections onto the @xmath7 and @xmath8 axes of the reference frame .",
    "the measurement is repeated for as many baselines as necessary to sufficiently fill the -plane .",
    "the image can then be recovered from the -data by fourier - inversion , and spurious responses removed by computer restoration .",
    "the spatial resolution of a synthesis imaging observation is not a priori defined .",
    "a diffraction - limited filled aperture with a diameter of @xmath9 operating at a wavelength of @xmath10 has a central response fwhm of 1.22 @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast , the final resolution of an image reconstructed from a set of interferometer measurements is not uniquely defined . by varying the weighting of the individual -coordinates , or even removing some baselines completely",
    ", one can put more or less emphasis on certain spatial frequencies in the reconstruction , and thus change the effective resolution , even _ after _",
    "the data are taken .",
    "for example , using a gaussian weighting which falls to 0.25 at the longest ( 12  m ) baseline results in a fwhm of 7  mas with very low sidelobes .",
    "another option is to use only a narrow ring of long baselines which yields a resolution almost twice as high as that of the full telescope .",
    "this fact is regularly exploited in `` aperture masking '' observations of bright double stars where collecting area is not an issue , but the highest possible resolution is required .",
    "therefore , sim will yield a resolution for synthesis imaging anywhere between 5 and 10  mas , depending on the actual distribution of measurements in the -plane , and the weighting algorithm used .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) is limited by the coherence length of the light , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the coherence time of the light , @xmath14 is the speed of light , and @xmath15 is the bandwidth of the filter used for the observations .",
    "it can be easily calculated as the product of the spectral and spatial resolutions , which can be seen as follows : while the path lengths from the two interferometer elements are assumed to be equal in the center of the field , an angular separation @xmath16 from the center along the baseline vector @xmath17 results in a path difference @xmath18 . as long as this difference is small compared to @xmath19 , the fringe contrast will not be affected .",
    "thus , @xmath20 , or @xmath21 .",
    "for example , a 10  nm wide channel at @xmath22 would result in a fov of 0.6 .",
    "any single baseline has a fov that forms a 0.6  wide , long strip on the sky that is positioned perpendicular to the baseline .",
    "however , as the baseline rotates , sources along the strip more than 0.6  away from the center will appear and disappear in the fov , thus affecting the measurements in an unpredictable way . in order to avoid this confusion",
    ", sim will have a circular aperture stop in its optical path .",
    "there is yet another constraint that sets even tighter limits on the fov , namely , the need to avoid aliasing . especially for a complicated source structure or crowded field",
    "this can be a major limitation on any deconvolution algorithm , since the sum of the grating rings of all the sources in the field can  and will  mimic fake sources , as will be demonstrated in section  [ clumps ] .",
    "unless a priori knowledge about the source structure exists , aliasing must be avoided for reliable source reconstruction .",
    "this means that in practice the sim fov is limited to a circle with a diameter of 0.2  , which can be seen as follows .",
    "the position of the first grating ring of a point source in the field is determined by the spacing of the baselines . in the case of 0.5  m increments ,",
    "the grating ring has a _ radius _ of 10/0.5=20 times @xmath23 or 0.2 . to make sure that no aliasing occurs from any source inside the fov , it has to be limited to a _ diameter _ of 0.2 .",
    "all of our simulations in this paper , however , have been carried out with a fov of 0.3  in order to demonstrate the above effects .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a possible -coverage obtained with 170 measurements and the resulting point spread function ( psf ) or `` dirty beam '' . here , and",
    "in all the simulations that are described in this paper , we have set the longest baseline to 10  m , which corresponds to the requirement of the original sim design . the current design offers a maximum baseline of 12  m. the grating rings in the psf described above are clearly visible . the number of samples in the -plane in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] is twice the number of measurements made .",
    "this is because any astronomical object has a purely real brightness distribution , so the mutual coherence function of the incoming wavefront is hermitian",
    ". therefore , once the complex visibility of point  has been measured , its conjugate can be entered at point ( @xmath24,@xmath25 ) .",
    "in addition , different from the case of radio interferometry , the total flux of the source is determined during every visibility measurement .",
    "this gives the value at the origin of the -plane ( the `` zero spacing '' ) to high accuracy .",
    "the `` noisy '' residuals around the central peak of the psf are due to the incomplete -coverage .",
    "since , however , the -coordinates of the sim measurements are defined with extremely high precision , the shape of the psf can be _ calculated _ very accurately and without the uncertainties and noise of an actual measurement .",
    "it is this precise knowledge of the psf that makes sim such a powerful imager , since the success of deconvolution algorithms like clean or the maximum entropy method ( mem ) is limited by the knowledge of the psf .",
    "the accuracy of the `` raw '' synthesized image before deconvolution depends in a complicated way on several parameters , including the noise properties and flux distribution of the source , the stability of the phase measurements , and the actual -coverage . in order to investigate these issues in detail ,",
    "we have developed a software toolkit which we will describe in section  [ simsim ] .",
    "jumping ahead , we list here the results of the simulations described in sections [ bh ] and [ exo ] in order to provide an estimate of typical integration times needed to perform synthesis imaging of extended astronomical objects .",
    "the surface brightness threshold for making scientifically useful images with sim in the continuum band from 500 - 800 nm is @xmath26 @xmath27 0.3 mjy/ which corresponds to @xmath28 = 17.7/. under the same conditions",
    "an emission line such as  can be imaged in a narrow ( 4  nm was assumed in the simulations ) band with a threshold surface brightness of @xmath29 ergs/@xmath30/sec/. a full synthesis with sim will take typically 4  6 hours of on - target integration time for sources at these brightness levels . during this time , 150  200 different baselines and baseline orientations will be observed .",
    "observations can of course be repeated to increase the sensitivity .",
    "these sensitivities can be achieved even in the presence of point sources up to v=12 in the field of view using the nulling imaging mode discussed in the next section .      because of its unprecedented baseline stability , sim has great potential for interferometric nulling of point sources .",
    "one of the sim beam combiners will introduce an achromatic 180  phase shift in one of the inteferometer arms by polarization inversion , thus eliminating the light from a point source that is located at the phase center .",
    "this capability is a programmatic technology demonstration requirement .",
    "the experience gained is crucial for the design of future space missions that are aimed at the detection of extra - solar planets , like e.g. the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) .",
    "the requirement for sim is to reach a nulling efficiency of @xmath0 .",
    "many interesting science programs intend to use this capability to determine the spatial extent of objects like stars or supernova shells by measuring the light leakage around the phase center .    in this paper",
    ", we will describe another mode of observation , namely synthesis imaging in nulling mode . in section 5",
    ", we will discuss the specific features of this technique for the case of exo - zodiacal dust disks .      since sim is designed to perform astrometric measurements in a dispersed fringe mode",
    ", it has a built - in spectroscopic capability .",
    "that is to say , the amplitude and phase of an object s wavefront are monitored simultaneously at a number of different wavelengths .",
    "since the same physical baseline translates into different -coordinates at different wavelengths , this information can , in principle , be used to increase the -coverage .",
    "this method is usually referred to as spectral synthesis imaging .",
    "spectral synthesis has one major caveat :",
    "the implicit assumption in the reconstruction of the source is that its _ structure does not change with wavelength_. in the optical regime this assumption is far from safe .",
    "in fact , it is often plain wrong , especially when strong emission lines are present in the bandpass considered .",
    "that does not mean that one can not use spectral synthesis with sim at all .",
    "there are classes of objects for which the above assumption is acceptable .",
    "for example , in the case of zodiacal disks around solar - type stars , it may be reasonable to assume that the structure of the source does not vary strongly over the sim passband , since it is observed only in reflected starlight .",
    "we will present the results of spectral synthesis simulations for exo - zodiacal disks in section  [ exo ] .",
    "in order to simulate the imaging capabilities of sim , we have developed  , a software package written in the interactive data language ( idl ) environment .",
    "the motivation was to obtain realistic performance estimates for a variety of target sources , and to develop optimal observing strategies .",
    "the principal steps carried out during a simulation are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    in brief , a model source distribution is put on a finely - sampled grid ( typically @xmath31 pixel ) . for simplicity",
    ", the field center is assumed to be the center of rotation of the spacecraft during the synthesis imaging , and no effort has been made so far to account for possible pointing instabilities .",
    "the mutual coherence function of the source wavefront is calculated via a fast fourier transform ( fft ) , and sampled on the -coordinates observed by sim .",
    "noise is added , and the actual phase and amplitude retrieval process is simulated .",
    "the details of this algorithm are described in appendix b. so far , we have incorporated photon noise according to poisson statistics , and random phase calibration errors with an amplitude of up to 0.5 .",
    "a final fourier inversion of this sampled and corrupted data then gives the `` dirty '' image .",
    "the psf is calculated by transforming a mutual coherence function of unit amplitude and zero phase at each -sample point of the observation .",
    "deconvolution algorithms like clean or the maximum entropy method ( mem ) can then be applied to minimize the effects of the incomplete -coverage .",
    "the nulling capability of sim is modeled as follows . before the noise",
    "is added to the source wavefront , its amplitude @xmath32 ( at each -coordinate ) is reduced by most of the amplitude @xmath33 of the source at the phase center @xmath34 : [ null_eq ] a_nulled = a - a_c(1- ) where @xmath35 denotes the accuracy to which nulling can be achieved . for sim , @xmath35 is expected to be around @xmath0 .",
    "it is limited by stray light due to imperfections in the optical elements and by the stability of the pathlengths .",
    "the phase of the wavefront is set to zero , resulting in an intrinsically symmetric source reconstruction .",
    "the reason for the loss of phase information is that the delay can not be modulated without losing the null : once the light is minimized , the delay lines have to be kept as stable as possible .",
    "the reduced amplitude of the signal results in lower photon counts on the detector which , in turn , reduces the poisson noise .",
    "equation [ null_eq ] ensures that the total flux in the reconstructed image is equal to the flux in the whole field - of - view * except for the central pixel * which , in the simulations , contains the flux of the nulled star .",
    "this is , of course , known for the models .",
    "however , in a real observation , such _ a priori _ information on the exact value of @xmath33 does not exist .",
    "it is only possible to measure the total flux  including the central source  by doing a standard observation in the direct beam combiner .",
    "an iterative approach will be necessary , which adds an appropriate * constant * to each amplitude measurement ; this constant is an estimate of the total flux in the field , minus the flux from the central source .",
    "if this value is chosen correctly , the reconstructed image will be zero at the phase center .",
    "since the model sources are intrinsically constructed on a regular grid , as are the -coordinates of the `` measurements '' , there is no need for gridding procedures in our code .",
    "however , real sources and real observations will not be so conveniently organized , so that in order to fully model the sim observations , weighting and gridding algorithms will have to be implemented .",
    "this work is currently underway .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] illustrates the graphical user interface ( gui ) of  .",
    "the top panel allows the user to select between a number of model sources and to choose various observational parameters of sim such as -coverage , spectral resolution , etc .",
    "the intermediate steps of the simulation are displayed in the four graphics windows .",
    "all results can be saved in postscript format for printing or in fits format for further work with idl or any other data analysis environment . in the following sections we use   to model the capabilities of sim to image two interesting classes of astronomical objects .",
    "black holes have been detected convincingly in at least a dozen galaxies , both active and quiescent .",
    "the techniques for such detections are multifold ( see @xcite for a review ) , but have concentrated on the dynamics of the gas and stars in the neighborhood of the black hole .",
    "stellar kinematical studies are often hampered by uncertainties regarding the stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy , and the need for high spatial resolution in connection with intrinsically low surface brightness makes such measurements very challenging even with hst .",
    "however , some galaxies have circumnuclear disks of ionized gas which provide a more favorable tool for black hole detection .",
    "the emission lines from the ionized gas are bright and have large equivalent width , and the dynamical state of the gas is relatively simple ; its rotation curve directly yields the black hole mass .    as a starting point for our discussion , we have chosen m  87 as the best known example for such a line - emitting gaseous disk .",
    "the next section briefly describes our input model for m  87 .",
    "m  87 , a dominant giant elliptical galaxy in the virgo cluster , is the prototype for galaxies that harbour a central black hole , the presence of which is revealed by a line - emitting gaseous disk . the nucleus of m  87 has been imaged with hst in both continuum ( @xcite ) and line emission ( @xcite , and the ionized gas has been studied spectroscopically in great detail ( @xcite ) we thus have a fairly clear picture of the properties of the nuclear gas disk .",
    "table [ tab1 ] summarizes the parameters we used to construct a realistic model flux distribution for the gaseous disk around the central black hole in m  87 .",
    "the  surface brightness over the central 0.25  of our model is @xmath36  ergs/@xmath30/ , as derived from the observed [ sii ] flux ( @xcite ) and an assumed line ratio of [ sii]/(+[nii ] ) = 4 .",
    "the gas is assumed to show keplerian rotation according to [ rotvel_eq ] ( ) ^2=0.08869 where  denotes the black hole mass , @xmath37 the angular distance from the center , and @xmath38 the distance to the galaxy .",
    "the numbers listed in table [ tab1 ] then result in the rotation curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "the  emission from the rotating disk would appear in a range of spectral channels , according to the doppler shift of the gas velocity projected along the line of sight .",
    "for the above parameters , a ( hypothetical ) diffraction - free 10m - telescope in space , equipped with an integral field spectrometer with 4  nm wide channels , would see the source as in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . here",
    ", we have convolved the `` true '' flux distribution of the m  87 model with the `` clean beam '' , a gaussian fitted to the central part of the psf .",
    "while the central , unresolved continuum source appears in all channels , the appearance of the  emission depends on parameters like channel width , black hole mass , inclination of the disk , etc .    to demonstrate the power of our analysis tools , we present in the next section what can be expected from sim observations of m  87 and similar sources .      in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we present a few examples of our simulations that are intended to give an impression of what imaging with sim can do in this context .",
    "the first row of the left panel again shows those channels of our m  87 model containing  emission .",
    "the channels again are 4  nm wide and centered at 554 , 558 , and 662  nm , respectively .",
    "the second row shows the result of the direct fourier inversion of the complex visibilities measured by sim .",
    "the -coverage was the same as in fig .  1 , and the integration time was 100s per measurement , for a total on - source integration time of about 5  hours .",
    "the nominal sim throughput of 0.3 was assumed .",
    "we added photon noise to the measurements according to poisson statistics .",
    "the third row shows the results after 200 iterations with the mem algorithm .",
    "the emission structure of the high velocity gas is well recovered .",
    "the same is true for the  intensity profile , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "the spatial extent of the  emission in each channel provides valuable information on the velocity gradient , and thus the black hole mass .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , where we have run the same simulation as described above , but for various black hole masses .",
    "we show only the blueshifted wing of the  emission for values of  = 2 , 3 , and 4@xmath39  .",
    "the sim observations are very sensitive to the value of , a direct consequence of the linear relationship between black hole mass and radial distance in a keplerian rotation curve , cf .",
    ". [ rotvel_eq ] .",
    "however , it should be stressed that in practice fitting procedures are required to solve for all the free model parameters including black hole mass , disc inclination , and the actual distribution of disk surface brightness .",
    "we emphasize that no attempt has been made to optimize the deconvolution process .",
    "for example , the stability and convergence of mem can be greatly improved by using `` a priori '' knowledge about the source structure . however , in order to better be able to compare the results for different source models , we have  for all the simulations in this paper  started the mem deconvolution with an empty array , and stopped after 200 iterations .",
    "for the real sim observations , one would make every effort to optimize the deconvolution strategy for each individual dataset .",
    "this is , in fact , another area where future simulation work with   will be useful .",
    "however , it is our experience that if no trace of the source structure is evident in the direct fourier inversion , no improvement can be expected from deconvolution , regardless of the algorithm employed .",
    "thus , the quality of the data can be most directly judged from the direct fourier inversion itself , before any restaoration .",
    "an important goal of   is to define requirements on various aspects of the sim spacecraft .",
    "as an example , what is the minimum spectral resolution of the sim beam combiner that allows observations such as the one discussed here ? certainly , the channel width must not be smaller than the wavelength shift of the emission line under observation at a distance of at least one resolution element from the center .",
    "this , of course , depends on the black hole mass and the distance to the host galaxy . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we have plotted the limiting black hole mass ( i.e. the minimum mass that causes a shift of the  emission of at least one spectral resolution element at an angular separation of two spatial resolution elements ( 0.02 ) from the center ) as a function of the distance to the host galaxy for a number of possible sim spectral resolutions and disk inclinations . for example , with 1  nm wide spectral channels ( dotted lines ) , sim can potentially detect @xmath40  black holes up to a distance of @xmath27 80  mpc , if the disk has an inclination @xmath41 .",
    "whether the -flux in cases different from m  87 is sufficient to acquire a high signal - to - noise ratio in a reasonable amount of time is more uncertain .",
    "circumstellar dust disks are commonly thought to provide the material for planet formation .",
    "the structure of such disks is therefore important for our understanding of the processes that lead to the formation of planetary systems .",
    "many searches have been started for such disks , most of which are based on coronographic observations and concentrate on stars with a high ir - excess as measured by the iras satellite ( e.g. @xcite ) . until most recently , however , only one unambiguous detection of a circumstellar dust disk outside the solar system had been reported , namely the  system . from modeling the  disk",
    ", @xcite found that it is the uncommonly large scattering cross - section of the dust particles that makes  a special case .",
    "if there were other nearby systems like , they would have been detected regardless of the disk inclination .",
    "@xcite conclude that at least an order of magnitude improvement in the suppression of the stellar light is needed to detect more `` normal '' circumstellar disks , i.e. with scattering cross section less than a tenth of that in .",
    "sim , with its interferometric nulling capability , differs from groundbased coronagraphic observations in a number of ways :    the starlight suppression in sim is not limited by atmospheric seeing or the efficiency of an adaptive optics system , but only by the quality of the optical elements and the pathlength stability .",
    "the high spatial resolution of sim allows the detection of disks much smaller than that in , and sim can therefore image such systems to greater distances @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , sim s ability to detect exozodiacal disks increases with @xmath38 , as long as the disk fills the 0.2  fov of sim .",
    "this somewhat surprising behavior is due to the fact that the surface brightness of the disk varies only slightly with @xmath38 , so its total signal on the sim detector will stay more or less constant .",
    "the signal from the star , on the other hand , decreases as @xmath42 , so that the noise contribution from the nulling residuals of @xmath0 become less important .",
    "in addition , the further away the star is , the more it resembles a true point source .",
    "this will reduce light leakage around the null , which is also a source of photon noise even for a perfect nulling beam combiner .",
    "since all phase information in the nulling process is lost , the source after reconstruction _ always _ appears symmetric .",
    "that means that eventual asymmetries in the disk can not be recovered .",
    "aliasing due to the incomplete sampling of the mutual coherence function can sometimes mimic companion stars or planets . in what follows",
    ", we investigate the sim potential for the detection of zodiacal disks and specifically address the points listed above .",
    "we use a simple model of a circumstellar dust disk , based on the zodiacal emission of the solar system ( @xcite ) .",
    "the particle number density of the solar system zodiacal dust cloud can be well modeled by the expression = _ 0 r^- e^-(z / r)^ where @xmath37 is the in - plane radial distance from the center , @xmath43 is the modulus of the perpendicular - to - plane distance ( in au ) , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "we treat the scattering efficiency of the dust particles as a flux scaling parameter , and we assume isotropic scattering . in what follows ,",
    "we investigate the two limiting cases of a face - on ( @xmath47=90 ) and edge - on ( @xmath47=0 ) orientation of the disk .",
    "the radial surface brightness distribution of the face - on disk can be derived from integrating the volume density .",
    "for @xmath48 it is given by the expression _",
    "( i=90^ ) = c_1 r^-+ 1 . here",
    ", @xmath49 is a scaling factor that characterizes the scattering efficiency of the dust particles in an exo - solar system relative to the solar system .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath50 is the surface brightness of the face - on disk , as seen from outside the solar system , at a distance of 1  au from the sun .",
    "assuming isotropic scattering , this number is ( at @xmath51=550  nm ) _ 1 = 0.13  mjy / sr",
    ". an approximate ratio of the surface densities of the edge - on and face - on directions at a given value for @xmath37 can be obtained by ratioing the characteristic scale heights of the @xmath43-direction and along a tangent to @xmath37 in the plane : e / f = ^1/ 5 .",
    "an approximation to the edge - on surface brightness distribution is therefore [ eq1 ] _ ( i=0^ ) = ce / f_1 r^-+ 1e^ . where @xmath52 is used .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] gives a visual impression of the model in both the face - on and edge - on case .",
    "the spectrum of the dust in the wavelength range discussed here ( 500  1000  nm ) is assumed to be that of a black body with the temperature of the central star .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate the question whether sim is capable of finding other systems like , should they exist . in this context , we define `` -like '' as having about 1000 times the dust content and surface brightness of the solar system , i.e. @xmath49=1000 , without any detailed modeling of the specific properties of  itself .    as mentioned above",
    ", the sim performance in terms of imaging of circumstellar disks is very limited for nearby systems , but improves with increasing distance , as long as the disk fills the fov .",
    "for example , the  disk itself is impossible to image with sim , because even with @xmath53 nulling , the photon noise of the remaining light from  would make the detection of the faint disk emission impossible .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] demonstrates the increasing sensitivity of sim up to distances of 1  kpc .",
    "again , we note that no attempt has been made to optimize the restoration procedure in order to avoid additional degrees of freedom . as can be seen in figure  [ fig11 ] , sim can easily detect -like systems up to a distance of about 1  kpc , beyond which our model disk no longer fills the sim fov and its total flux drops rapidly .",
    "this distance limit depends linearly on the extent of the disk , for which we have assumed a value of 100  au .",
    "this is a somewhat arbitrary number , chosen such that the angular diameter at a distance of 1  kpc is 0.2 , equal to the sim fov .",
    "the central star is assumed to be of solar type ( @xmath54=5 ) .",
    "the above results change dramatically if systems with lower dust contents than  are considered .",
    "the dust content of our model disks is parametrized by the constant @xmath49 in eq .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] summarizes our results on studying various values for @xmath49 .",
    "disks with more than a tenth of the dust content of  can be detected with sim .",
    "however , it is evident that zodiacal disks similar to that of the solar system will not be found with sim , regardless of their distance or inclination .",
    "it is interesting that in all of our reconstructions , the disk structure after deconvolution appears much more clumpy than the smooth input model .",
    "in fact , when looking at the results , one might in many cases think to have found a number of planets .",
    "these `` clumps '' are artefacts of the restoration process on our incomplete -data .",
    "while the sidelobe pattern itself is known to high accuracy , the poisson noise associated with the signal does not have the shape of the psf .",
    "spikes in the noise distribution create residuals that are mistaken as real source structure by any deconvolution algorithm .",
    "the fact that the clumps are indeed randomly distributed can be seen when comparing three independent simulations of the face - on zodiacal disk of a -like system at 1  kpc and a nulling efficiency of @xmath55 in figures  [ fig11],[fig12 ] , and [ fig13 ] , which only differ in their random photon noise .",
    "a repetition of the observation would allow identification of such spurious objects .      in order to investigate the effects of a degradation of the sim nulling capability",
    ", we have run a series of simulations with different values for @xmath35 , the nulling efficiency in eq .",
    "[ null_eq ] .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] demonstrates that for a -like system at 1  kpc , the most favorable case in all of the simulations we have run so far , sim could detect the disk even if it had only @xmath56 .",
    "however , anything worse than that would not suppress the starlight sufficiently even at such high distances .",
    "we conclude that in order to be a powerful search engine for exo - zodiacal disks , sim needs to achieve at least @xmath57 , and anything better would improve the performance considerably .      a massive planet",
    " if present  is believed to sweep up any inward - spiraling debris and thus cause a dust - free region in the circumstellar disk inward of the planet s orbit .",
    "such an `` inner gap '' is believed to exist in the -system , as inferred from its spectral energy distribution ( @xcite ) , but the gap has never been directly imaged owing to the large radius which is masked out by coronographic instruments .    with its high spatial resolution and sensitive nulling ,",
    "sim is able to directly image possible inner clear regions in exo - zodiacal systems .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.[fig14 ] where we have investigated the case of a -like disk at a distance of 500  pc with and without a 20  au inner clear region .",
    "clearly , the signature of the disk depends on its size and the distance to the system , but a 20  au radius gap would be detectable in systems as distant as 1  kpc . here , we just want to illustrate the intriguing prospect of directly imaging such gaps ( and later , possibly the planets that cause them ) .",
    "we have built an interactive software package that enables us to perform numerical simulations of imaging observations with sim .",
    "the results obtained so far can be summarized as follows :    sim , with a spectral resolution of 1  nm , can resolve the velocity structure of line - emitting gaseous disks around black holes in the centers of nearby galaxies down to black hole masses of @xmath40  at distances up to 100  mpc . with this resolution , sim is in principle capable of determining the mass of the black hole to 10% accuracy .",
    "the necessary integration time depends on the -flux from the disk ; for cases like m  87 , about 5  hours is sufficient .",
    "a coarser spectral resolution of sim would constrain the accessible parameter space for quantities such as distance , black hole mass , or disk inclination .    given a nulling efficiency of @xmath0 , sim can image zodiacal disks with dust contents similar to that of the -system with high signal - to - noise ratio in about 5  hours of integration time .",
    "the limiting distance depends only on the angular size of the disk , which should be no smaller than 0.1 .",
    "inner clear regions in the disk can be directly detected and imaged with sim for systems at a distance of up to 1  kpc provided that the dust - free region has a radius of at least 20  au .",
    "we are grateful to r. van der marel for his advice on the black hole simulations , and to w. traub for his expertise on the zodiacal disk model .",
    "we also would like to thank s. unwin , m. colavita and m. shao for their interest in and continued support of this project . the work described in this paper",
    "is carried out at stsci with financial support from the sim project at the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) .",
    "the idea that an interferometer could be constructed to measure the angular diameters of stars is usually credited to @xcite , although no details were provided in that particular reference .",
    "twenty years later , @xcite took it up and , another 30 years later with pease , constructed the now - famous stellar interferometer on the 100-inch telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig15 ] shows a sketch of the original drawing from that paper , to which we have added symbols indicating the spacing @xmath58 of the outrigger mirrors and the spacing @xmath59 of the mirrors at the telescope aperture which direct the light to the primary mirror .",
    "variations of this sketch appear in many introductory textbooks on physics and astronomy .",
    "the image of a star in the focal plane of the stellar interferometer is crossed by interference fringes , as shown in cross section in fig.[fig16 ] , where some additional parameters are defined : the _ fringe amplitude _ @xmath32 , the _ fringe period _ @xmath60 and the _ fringe phase _ @xmath61 . in this picture the average signal from the star has been normalized to 1 .",
    "the overall size of the airy pattern is set by the aperture formed by the cascade of small reflecting mirrors which direct the light to the telescope primary mirror .    as is well known from the general theory of wave diffraction ,",
    "this fraunhofer diffraction pattern in the focal plane of the telescope is the square modulus of the fourier transform of the distribution of illumination ( in amplitude and in relative phase ) over the aperture .",
    "the expression for the stellar interferometer can be derived in a straightforward way , at least in one dimension , by starting from the result for the single - slit diffraction problem .",
    "we then use standard theorems from the theory of fourier transforms , in particular the shift theorem and the convolution theorem , and apply them to a plane wavefront over the entrance aperture ( pupil ) . in this way it is straightforward to show that the final fraunhofer pattern for an unresolved star is the square modulus of @xmath62 with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , @xmath61 being an angle as defined in fig.[fig16 ] .",
    "this is the product of the pattern @xmath65 for a single slit of width @xmath66 offset to @xmath67 , and the pattern @xmath68 for a very thin double slit offset to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the angular distance of the star from the direction normal to the baseline @xmath58 .",
    "we note that :    * as the source position @xmath70 changes , the fringe phase moves at an amplified rate @xmath71 .",
    "the positional accuracy is therefore _ magnified _ by @xmath72 . *",
    "the fringe period remains set by the separation @xmath59 of the secondary apertures no matter what is the separation @xmath58 of the primary apertures on the outriggers .",
    "sim can be regarded as a michelson stellar interferometer with two specific features :    * the separation @xmath59 of the secondary apertures is reduced to zero which we ignore here . ] .",
    "the fringe period therefore becomes infinitely large , and the entire image of the star is either light or dark depending on the fringe phase . * a delay @xmath73 is added to one side of the interferometer light path ( e.g. between m@xmath74 and m@xmath75 in order to shift the double - slit pattern from @xmath76 back to within a small offset @xmath77 from the position of the star @xmath78 .",
    "this is necessary because of the finite bandwidth of the signal , which results in a limited coherence length , as discussed in section [ fov ] .",
    "we will discuss the bandwidth effects on the fringe contrast later in this section .",
    "the fraunhofer pattern for a monochromatic point source in our one - dimensional model of sim is therefore the square modulus of : [ eqa2 ] m(u ) = 2 f(u - u_0 ) ( ( l_0 - ) / ) , which is [ pointsource ] p(u ) = |m(u)|^2 = p_0(u)(1 + ( 2/ ) ) where @xmath79 .",
    "viewed as a function of the delay offset @xmath77 , this is a co - sinusoidal pattern with an average value set by the intensity @xmath80 of the star is ignored further here .",
    "it comes in because we have doubled the collecting area by using two outrigger mirrors , and it will be subsumed into @xmath80 by the overall interferometer calibration procedure . ] , and varying from zero to @xmath81 .",
    "the fringe amplitude here is 1 , appropriate for a point source .",
    "consider now an extended source in the sky , which we integrate in a direction perpendicular to the interferometer baseline in order to produce a 1-d image @xmath82 where @xmath61 is an angle measured in the plane of the baseline ( fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] ) .",
    "let us further assume that the position @xmath70 to which we have initially offset the fringe pattern from our calibration grid star ( by adding a delay @xmath83 ) is somewhere in the middle of @xmath82 .",
    "each part @xmath84 of the spatially - extended source then contributes a fringe pattern : [ fringecontrib ] dp ( ) = b()d(1 + e^-2i(l- ) / ) ) ; where again @xmath85 and @xmath86 denotes the real part of the exponential .",
    "let us further simplify the notation by assuming that the fov is confined to a small region on the sky , so that @xmath87 , and measure @xmath58 in wavelengths , @xmath88 .",
    "the total fringe pattern obtained by integrating equation [ fringecontrib ] is then : p = b_0 + _ -^+b()e^-2i ( l - l_0-/)d .",
    "we can write the integral in this equation as : b_0 e^2i(l_0+/ ) ( l ) , where we recognize @xmath89 as the fourier transform of the normalized @xmath82 : ( l ) = .",
    "since @xmath82 will in general not be symmetric about @xmath70 , @xmath89 will be complex , so we can write @xmath90 , leading to : [ spacefringe ] p = p_0 \\ { 1 + a(l ) ( 2(l_0 - ( l ) + /))}.",
    "there are 3 unknowns here : the average power @xmath80 , the fringe amplitude @xmath91 , and the fringe phase @xmath92 ( measured here in turns ) .",
    "they can all be determined by measuring @xmath93 as a function of delay @xmath77 . in practice , this can be achieved by continously scanning @xmath77 over @xmath94 , and recording @xmath93 over a number of time intervals .",
    "this is the basis for our simulation of the measurement process and the introduction of photon noise , as will be described in appendix b.    let us now consider the effects of the finite bandwidth of the interfering light . in order to keep the algebra manageable , we consider only the case of a plane wave from a point source .",
    "the fringe pattern we have derived in equation [ pointsource ] will be different for different values of the wavelength @xmath51 .",
    "the total response is the sum of the fringe patterns for all wavelengths over the spectral range of the passband .",
    "suppose the passband has a spectral shape @xmath95 .",
    "then , in analogy to equation [ fringecontrib ] , that part of the spectrum at frequency @xmath96 contributes a fringe : [ spectrafringe ] dp ( ) = s()d(1 + e^2i(l_0 - ) / ) . where @xmath97 .",
    "we define a delay time @xmath98 where @xmath14 is the speed of light .",
    "then we have : dp ( ) = s()d\\{1 + e^-2i}. the total fringe pattern is obtained by integrating : p = s_0 + _ -^+s()e^-2id .",
    "we recognize the integral as the fourier transform @xmath99 of the filter function @xmath95 .",
    "as an example , let s take a rectangular filter of height @xmath100 and width @xmath15 centered at @xmath101 .",
    "the transform of this function is related by the shift theorem to the transform of a function @xmath102 having the same shape but centered at the origin .",
    "the transform of @xmath102 is @xmath103 , so the transform of @xmath104 is @xmath105 , and the fringe pattern becomes : p ( ) = s_0 \\{1 + ( ) ( 2 _ 0 ) } , so that if we scan @xmath106 and record the intensity of the stellar image in the focal plane of sim we will obtain the pattern shown in figure [ fig18 ] .",
    "in order to provide an estimate of sim sensitivity and image quality , various noise components associated with the measurements need to be modeled as realistically as possible .",
    "the systematic ( calibration ) errors of the spacecraft are hard to predict at this time , because the design has not been finalized and a detailed hardware model is not yet available . as of now",
    ", we can only make assumptions on parameters such as fringe phase stability . on the other hand , the statistical errors due to photon statistics are straightforward to model .",
    "they are implemented in   as follows .",
    "the fundamental shape of the signal as a function of path difference ( delay ) between the two interfering beams has been derived in equation [ spacefringe ] . here",
    ", the term `` signal '' means the total number of photons falling on the detector over the integration time .",
    "if the delay @xmath77 is continously modulated over @xmath94 , then one can integrate the detector signal over four time `` bins '' , during each of which the delay moves over a quarter wave .",
    "this method has first been described by @xcite and was suggested for use in astronomical interferometers by @xcite .",
    "it is usually referred to as the `` quadrature method '' and has been used in many ground - based interferometers .",
    "the usual implementation uses a triangular modulation of the delay with piezo - electric elements ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in ground - based interferometers",
    "the delay is scanned over the range of one wavelength in about 10  ms owing to the short coherence time of the atmospheric seeing , which otherwise moves the fringe phase @xmath61 in a random way . in principle , there is no need for high modulation frequencies in space , so that instead of a continous modulation , one could envisage a `` stop - and - stare '' mode for the delay @xmath77 .",
    "however , since the continous modulation technique is well established and simple to handle mathematically , we have used it to simulate the measurements in  . following @xcite , the signal in the four bins @xmath107 ... @xmath108 which , for mathematical simplicity have the limits @xmath109$],@xmath110 $ ] , @xmath111 $ ] , and @xmath112 $ ] can calculated by integrating equation [ spacefringe ] over these intervals , yielding : @xmath113 @xmath80 here is the total signal ( in photons ) in the fov over the spectral passband during the integration time . in the case of a simulation , the values for the fringe amplitude and phase , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , are known from the fourier transform of the model source structure .",
    "therefore , the values @xmath116 can be calculated , and poisson noise can be added to them , before using the `` measurements '' to recover the source .",
    "these values are re - entered in an empty array ( the -plane ) , and the ( sparsely - filled ) array is fourier back - transformed to yield the reconstructed image of the source . as an option for the user , an additional noise component can be added that tries to model the expected phase calibration errors .",
    "our simulations have shown , however , that up to the specified maximum error of 0.5 , this has negligible effects on the restoration quality .",
    "since the psf can also be computed , the recovered image can further be improved by applying restoration algorithms like clean or mem .",
