    "the spectroscopy of low - dimensional semiconductor structures has found in the inelastic ( raman ) scattering of light a powerful tool @xcite . by means of this technique , a whole sector of the electronic excitation spectrum , not reachable from direct light absorption because of kohn theorem @xcite ,",

    "single - particle and collective states , spin- and charge excitations leave a trace in the raman spectra .    the interpretation of the results of a raman experiment , on the other hand , is usually based on a simplified theoretical expression , the so called off - resonance approximation ( ora ) @xcite .",
    "the ora states that , far away from resonance conditions , the raman scattering amplitude is dominated by collective states , i. e. , by states carrying on most of the strength of multipole operators .",

    "a resonant enhancement of raman intensities for particular values of the incident laser energy has been observed @xcite .",
    "this resonant effect is clearly not described by the ora , and has been ascribed to the existence of incoming and outgoing resonances in the intermediate states .",

    "this is a pretty example in which the results are partially valid in spite of the fact that the physical conditions for the application of the ora are not .    in the present paper ,",
    "we perform a critical examination of the validity of the ora by computing raman scattering amplitudes for a 42-electron quantum dot .",
    "the position of raman peaks are then compared with the position of collective states , obtained from the evaluation of multipole operators .",
    "let us stress that the typical dots used in the experiments reviewed in [ ] contain around 200 electrons .",

    "[ fig1 ] the raman intensity , @xmath74 , in the charge monopole channel .",
    "this means that final electronic states in the scattering process are monopole excitations ( @xmath82 ) with the same total spin projection as the initial ground state , @xmath31 .",

    "a scaling factor is introduced for the sake of clarity .",
    "we see a distinct tendency toward dominance of the cde state for below band gap excitation , an indication that the ora regime is being reached .",
    "this tendency is reinforced when the in - plane confinement , @xmath59 , is lowered .",
    "the reason is simple . to compute @xmath74 , we use intermediate states in the interval [ @xmath87 mev ] .",
    "when @xmath59 is decreased by a factor @xmath88 , the number of states in this interval increases roughly by the same factor , and the assumption made in the derivation of the ora concerning completeness of the set of intermediate states is better fulfilled .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] curves for @xmath89 and 3 mev as examples .",
    "let us stress that the argument to restrict the sum over intermediate states to this energy interval is more than technical , and is related to the sudden increase of @xmath24 for larger excitation energies , as will be discussed below .    figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show results of calculations in other channels .",

    "the collective state , labeled sde ( spin density excitation ) , lies to the left of the single - particle peaks in this case .",
    "the behavior when @xmath13 is varied is similar to the charge monopole situation discussed above .",
    "the sde dominates the spectrum for below band gap excitation , and this tendency is better observed for @xmath92 mev .    in the charge quadrupole channel , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and",
    "polarized raman geometry , right lower panel , the dominance of the cde is observed only when @xmath59 is lowered to 3 mev , accompanied by a strong decrease of the intensity .",
    "dipole final states , @xmath95 , however , show a different behavior in which collective states are never the dominant peaks in raman scattering .",
    "the charge dipole channel , @xmath96 , @xmath94 , computed in the polarized geometry , is shown in the right upper panel .",
    "notice that the cde is not a significant peak even with above band gap excitation .",
    "in the spin - flip case , left lower corner , the sde state is always a low peak .",
    "notice , in addition , that in the latter case the intensity experiences a strong decrease for below band gap excitation .",
    "we have computed raman intensities from a 42-electron qdot in different angular momentum and spin channels for below band gap excitation to show how and to what extent the ora regime is reached .",
    "it was demonstrated that for ( charge and spin ) monopole ( @xmath82 ) final states , collective excitations rapidly become the dominant excited modes and , already for laser energy 30 mev below the effective band gap , are the main peaks in the raman spectra .    in any other channel , however , the ora may or may not play a relevant role",
    ". we observed , for example , the dominance of the cde state in the charge quadrupole channel when @xmath59 is lowered , and thus the density of states in the dot is increased .",
    "but we observed no range of @xmath13 in which collective modes become the leading dipole peaks .",
    "the conclusion is that the ora works very well for monopole states , but only conditionally for quadrupole ones , and very badly for dipole states",
    ". the number of electrons in the dot or the strength of the external confining potential may dictate the way in which the ora regime is reached by varying the density of energy levels in the dot .",
    "experiments in quantum dots for below band gap excitation could confirm this conclusion .",
    "more generally speaking , we suggest caution when an experimental raman peak is to be interpreted as a collective excitation , on the basis of ora arguments , in other systems like quantum wires or wells .",
    "theoretical calculations should support this kind of assignements .",
    "collective states could dominate a raman spectrum in a regime very different to that one leading to the ora .",
    "let us recall again the results presented in paper [ ] for laser excitation energies 40 - 50 mev above the effective band gap . in this energy interval",
    "there are plenty of intermediate states , thus the experiment deals with a resonant regime .",
    "a correct theoretical description should , probably , take account of the dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath25.@xcite on qualitative grounds , one can expect a sudden increase of @xmath24 when @xmath25 is over 40 mev above the effective band gap",
    ". there could be , however , special intermediate states ( which can be thought of as `` plasmon plus exciton '' states ) for which @xmath24 may preserve relatively small values .",
    "the physics of raman scattering in this regime is based , in our opinion , on the existence of these intermediate state resonances , and has no relation with the ora .",
    "this interesting problem deserves more theoretical and experimental work on it .",
    "a second example of collective states dominating raman scattering , and in which the ora has no relevance , is given in ref .",
    "[ ] , where the peak related to the electronic cyclotron resonance in a quantum well undergoes an abrupt increase when it moves through the position of a luminescence peak ( this is achieved by varying @xmath13 ) . the theoretical description , we guess , should include the enhancement of raman intensity due to the background luminescence ( the @xmath22 variable , which was set to zero in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) ) and a consistent calculation of luminescence ( including master equations for the population of the intermediate states ) .",
    "this situation is , again , far from the simple assumptions leading to the ora .",
    "our final conclusion is , thus , that there are still many interesting experimental and theoretical aspects of raman scattering in semiconductor quantum structures waiting for elucidation .",
    "simple recipes such as the ora give a first insight into the physics , but more elaborated theoretical constructions are needed for a complete understanding of the process .",
