    "high critical - temperature ( @xmath4 ) cuprate superconductors are distinguished from conventional _ s_-wave superconductors by a predominantly _ d_-wave order parameter ( op)@xcite . the _ d_-wave op symmetry has led to a wealth of unconventional experimental phenomena .",
    "one such phenomenon is the formation of low - energy andreev states bound on non principal - axis surfaces of cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "when probed by quasiparticle tunneling , these andreev states are manifested as zero - bias peaks ( zbcp ) in the conductance spectra of high - impedance tunnel junctions .",
    "these andreev states form when time - reversed quasiparticles interfere constructively via the phase sign change of the _ d_-wave op about its nodal ( @xmath5=@xmath6@xmath7 ) axes@xcite . for _ s_-wave superconductors ,",
    "tunneling involves quasiparticle transmission , and is thus only sensitive to the amplitude of the op .",
    "tunneling into _ d_-wave superconductors involves both quasiparticle transmission and andreev reflection , and is thus sensitive to both the phase and amplitude of the pair wavefunction@xcite .",
    "recent interest has been focused on how the _ d_-wave andreev bound states , quasiparticle density of states , and pairing symmetry itself could evolve under an applied supercurrent@xcite . in this paper , we present a scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) study of yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) thin - film strips carrying directly - applied supercurrents at 4.2k .",
    "our study uses the supercurrent to perturb the superconducting op _ electrodynamically _ , rather than _ thermodynamically _ as was previously done in magnetic field studies@xcite .",
    "high-@xmath4 cuprates have characteristically short coherence lengths , which can be @xmath8 nm in the basal plane . by virtue of its nanoscale junction size",
    ", sts can thus provide coherence - length scale information about the high-@xmath4 op when driven by an applied supercurrent . in our experiment , we observed systematic suppression of the _ phase_-sensitive spectral features by the supercurrent , while the _ amplitude_-dependent features remain largely unchanged .",
    "we discuss and rule out the likelihood of various extrinsic effects , and propose instead a model based on current - driven op phase fluctuations to describe the phenomenon observed .",
    "our experimental setup is illustrated in the left inset of figure [ prl_fig1 ] , showing a pt - ir tip positioned over a ybco thin - film strip in an sts geometry , with a au contact providing the bias voltage _ v _ between tip and sample .",
    "sts is performed in the usual manner , by measuring the tunneling current _ _ i__@xmath9 with the scanning and feedback temporarily suspended , but while a current _ _ i__@xmath10 is simultaneously applied through the superconducting film at 4.2k . in this sts geometry , the high junction impedance ( @xmath80.1g@xmath11 ) ensures that _ _",

    ". short duty - cycle _ _ i__@xmath10 pulses @xmath12200@xmath13s in width are used to prevent sample joule heating , which could occur at high current levels .",
    "dc measurements are also made at lower current levels for comparison , in order to rule out transient electronic effects . for our experiment , this versatile sts technique enabled very low - noise ( @xmath145pa ) and highly reproducible tunneling @xmath15-@xmath16 measurements at nanometer length scales .",
    "the ybco thin - film strips used in our experiment were grown by pulsed laser - ablated deposition on srtio@xmath17 ( sto ) substrates .",
    "both \\{110 } and \\{001 } oriented films were made , the former using a templating technique .",
    "the films were typically 50 nm thick and in a 1 mm x 3 mm strip - line geometry , aligned along @xmath14100@xmath18 and @xmath191@xmath200@xmath21 $ ] respectively for the \\{001 } and \\{110 } films .",
    "the film strips showed well - defined @xmath4 s ( @xmath1287k ) and sizable transport critical - current densities at 4.2k ( @xmath22@xmath125@xmath23@xmath24a/@xmath25 , defined by the appearance of 1@xmath13v / mm along the strip ) .",
    "epitaxiality of the films was confirmed by x - ray diffraction and rocking - curve analysis .",
    "film surface quality was determined directly from topography measurements using our sts setup .",
    "shown in the inset of figure [ prl_fig4 ] is a topographic image taken on a \\{001 } film , indicating smooth terraces with large _ c_-axis faces @xmath830 nm in size and _ ab_-plane edges @xmath83 nm in height .",

    "the @xmath26 spectra , which were numerically differentiated from the @xmath15-@xmath16 data , are plotted in the right inset , and the normalized @xmath26 spectra are plotted in the main panel .",
    "these spectra show a well - developed zbcp structure which is suppressed in height but only slightly changed in width by the applied current .",
    "such zbcp structures have been commonly observed in ybco , and could be identified as the low - energy andreev states based on a predominant _ d_-wave op @xcite .",
    "two features of the zbcp spectral evolution versus current are noteworthy .",
    "first , the zbcp shows no splitting , indicating time - reversal invariance of the _ d_-wave op up to 160ma ( the maximum applied current ) in our near - optimally doped ybco samples at 4.2k .",
    "second , the area under _ di / dv _ is not conserved , indicating negligible thermal broadening , with a clear loss of andreev states .",
    "the non - splitting of the zbcp we observed is quantitatively consistent with a recent theoretical calculation @xcite , which shows no doppler shift @xcite of the andreev bound states in this geometry until a higher supercurrent density .",

    "we have considered various extrinsic effects in analyzing the phenomenon we observed .",
    "one possible extrinsic effect is the joule heating from the sizable current applied .",
    "however , our pulsed current technique , along with the absence of significant zbcp broadening , largely rule out this possibility .",
    "a second possible extrinsic effect involves current - generated vortices that could introduce aharonov - bohm phases in the andreev interference process@xcite .",
    "we note that our current levels are well below the theoretical depairing limit@xcite , and also below any sharp voltage onsets associated with vortex depinning , although our present experimental resolution can not yet rule out the presence of such vortices .",
    "nevertheless , the theoretical calculation in ref.14 has predicted a zbcp broadening which we do not observe , thus rendering this vortex scenario unlikely .",
    "a third possible extrinsic effect involves excess low - energy quasiparticles due to the applied nodal current@xcite . in this scenario",
    ", the excess quasiparticles could effectively raise the quasiparticle temperature , again creating spectral broadening which we do not observe . in summary ,",
    "all three extrinsic effects described above would be expected to yield a conservation of the low - energy andreev states , and are therefore unlikely to explain our observations .",
    "having ruled out the likelihood of these various extrinsic scenarios , we propose instead an explanation based on current - driven op phase fluctuations to describe the observed phenomenon .",
    "high - temperature superconducting cuprates are distinguished by their low carrier densities and short coherence lengths@xcite .",
    "these properties imply an inherently low superfluid stiffness , making the order parameter susceptible to fluctuations in its phase @xcite .",

    "any of the above scenarios may lead to local regions containing a weakened op , with respect to phase fluctuations . in this connection , it is worth noting that such weakened regions could also be nucleation centers for phase - slip phenomena , which were seen in recent transport studies on superconducting ybco microstrips @xcite .",

    "work would be necessary to clarify this issue .",
    "experimentally , the technique presented in our present work , measuring the evolution of the andreev states under a supercurrent , may in fact provide a definitive way to distinguish between the specular and non - specular cases@xcite .",
