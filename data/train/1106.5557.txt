    "classical chaos is related to the extreme sensitivity of the dynamics of a system to its initial conditions , a concept that can be traced back to poincar.@xcite the main features of classical chaos can be illustrated by a dynamical billiard , which is an idealized billiard table with no friction where a particle reflects elastically from boundaries which can have any shape .",
    "the motion of the particle is represented in phase space by a trajectory whose evolution is restricted to a surface of constant energy . depending on the shape of the boundaries , the system may be chaotic , which means that two trajectories whose initial conditions are very close will diverge exponentially in time .",
    "the rate of this separation is characterized by the lyapunov exponent.@xcite the trajectories may also become ergodic , which implies that after a long time the particle will have visited the entire surface of constant energy .",
    "equivalently , we may say that after a long time , the particle is equally likely to be found in any point of the accessible phase space .    for quantum systems",
    "the notion of phase - space trajectories loses its meaning as can be seen from the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "nevertheless , because classical physics is a limit of quantum physics , it is natural to search for quantum signatures of classical chaos .",
    "the relation between quantum mechanics and classical chaos is the subject of quantum chaos.@xcite    quantum chaos is a very broad field .",
    "our intention is not to review the entire field , but to focus on a particular aspect of it , namely , the spectral statistics and structures of eigenstates of quantum many - body systems as they transition from the regular to the chaotic domain . as a preparation for our goal , we first give a brief idea of some of the important topics of the field ( more details are in refs .   and in the references",
    "to be cited ) .",
    "quantum chaos encompasses semiclassical theories aiming at establishing direct links between the trajectories of classically chaotic systems and the properties of these systems in the quantum domain .",
    "the main advances in this area were achieved by periodic - orbit theory , which provides a way to calculate the spectrum of a quantum system from its classical periodic orbits ( trajectories that repeat themselves after a certain time ) .",
    "an excellent introduction to the subject was given by gutzwiller.@xcite gutzwiller s method allowed for the development of a theory of `` scars,''@xcite which refer to the structure of eigenstates that concentrate along the classical periodic orbits of chaotic systems .",
    "scars were systematically studied by heller,@xcite and the first experimental observations occurred in quantum billiards . @xcite quantum billiards obey the laws of quantum mechanics and correspond to miniature versions of dynamical billiards .    another important step in the understanding of quantum chaos came from the verification that the distribution of the spacings between neighboring energy levels of a quantum billiard depend on the billiard s classical counterpart.@xcite if the latter is chaotic , the energy levels are highly correlated and repel each other ; if it is regular ( integrable ) , the energy levels are uncorrelated , randomly distributed , and can cross .",
    "level repulsion is one of the main features of quantum chaos .",
    "it has been observed in other quantum systems , such as atoms in strong magnetic fields @xcite and systems of coupled particles,@xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the context of number theory , level repulsion has been associated also with distributions of prime numbers.@xcite    in this article we focus on quantum many - body systems . a common approach when dealing with such systems",
    "is to ignore the details of the interactions and treat them statistically with random matrices .",
    "the idea is that when the interactions are strong and the behavior of the system is sufficiently complex , generic properties should emerge .",
    "this approach was taken by wigner @xcite to describe the spectrum of heavy nuclei .",
    "he employed matrices with random elements whose only constraint was to satisfy the symmetries of the system .",
    "the level spacing distributions of these matrices showed level repulsion and agreed surprisingly well with the data from actual nuclei spectra . when level repulsion was later verified in billiards , a connection between quantum chaos and random matrices became established .",
    "soon after the introduction of random matrices in nuclear physics , they were employed in the analysis of the spectrum of other quantum many - body systems , such as atoms , molecules , and quantum dots.@xcite    the application of random matrix theory is not restricted to the statistics of eigenvalues , but accommodates also studies of eigenstates .",
    "eigenstates of random matrices are pseudo - random vectors ; that is , their amplitudes are random variables.@xcite all the eigenstates are statistically similar , they spread through all basis vectors with no preferences and are therefore ergodic .    despite the success of random matrix theory in describing spectral statistical properties",
    ", it can not capture the details of real quantum many - body systems .",
    "the fact that random matrices are completely filled with statistically independent elements implies infinite - range interactions and the simultaneous interaction of many particles .",
    "real systems have few - body ( most commonly only two - body ) interactions which are usually finite range . a better picture of systems with finite - range interactions is provided by banded random matrices , which were also studied by wigner . @xcite",
    "their off - diagonal elements are random and statistically independent , but are non - vanishing only up to a fixed distance from the diagonal .",
    "there are also ensembles of random matrices that take into account the restriction to few body interactions , so that only the elements associated with those interactions are nonzero ; an example is the two - body - random - ensemble@xcite ( see reviews in refs .  ) .",
    "other models which describe systems with short - range and few - body interactions do not include random elements , such as nuclear shell models,@xcite and the systems of interacting spins which we consider in this article .",
    "all the matrices we have mentioned can lead to level repulsion , but differences are observed .",
    "for instance , eigenstates of random matrices are completely spread ( delocalized ) in any basis , whereas the eigenstates of systems with few - body interactions delocalize only in the middle of the spectrum.@xcite    in this paper we study a one - dimensional system of interacting spins 1/2 .",
    "the system involves only nearest - neighbor interactions , and in some cases , also next - nearest - neighbor interactions . depending on the strength of the couplings , the system may develop chaos , which is identified by calculating the level spacing distribution .",
    "we also compare the level of delocalization of the eigenstates in the integrable and chaotic domains .",
    "it is significantly larger in the latter case , where the most delocalized states are found in the middle of the spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  ii provides a detailed description of the hamiltonian of a spin 1/2 chain .",
    "section  iii explains how to compute the level spacing distribution and how to quantify the level of delocalization of the eigenstates .",
    "section  iv shows how the mixing of symmetries may erase level repulsion even when the system is chaotic .",
    "final remarks are given in sec .",
    "-0.1 cm we study a one - dimensional spin 1/2 system ( a spin 1/2 chain ) described by the hamiltonian    [ hamall ] @xmath0.\\label{ham3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have set @xmath1 equal to 1 , @xmath2 is the number of sites , @xmath3 are the spin operators at site @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the pauli matrices . the term @xmath6 gives the zeeman splitting of each spin @xmath4 , as determined by a static magnetic field in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "all sites are assumed to have the same energy splitting @xmath8 , except a single site @xmath9 , whose energy splitting @xmath10 is caused by a magnetic field slightly larger than the field applied on the other sites .",
    "this site is referred to as a defect .",
    "a spin in the positive @xmath7 direction ( up ) is indicated by @xmath11 or by the vector @xmath12 ; a spin in the negative @xmath7 direction ( down ) is represented by @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "an up spin on site @xmath4 has energy @xmath15 , and a down spin has energy @xmath16 .",
    "a spin up corresponds to an excitation .",
    "the second term , @xmath17 , is known as the xxz hamiltonian .",
    "it describes the couplings between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spins ; @xmath18 is the strength of the flip - flop term @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the strength of the ising interaction @xmath21 .",
    "the flip - flop term exchanges the position of neighboring up and down spins according to @xmath22 or , equivalently , it moves the excitations through the chain .",
    "we have assumed open boundary conditions as indicated by the sum in @xmath17 which goes from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "hence , an excitation in site 1 ( or @xmath2 ) can move only to site 2 ( or to site @xmath24 ) .",
    "closed boundary conditions , where an excitation in site 1 can move also to site @xmath2 ( and vice - versa ) are mentioned briefly in sec .",
    "the ising interaction implies that pairs of parallel spins have higher energy than pairs of anti - parallel spins , that is , @xmath25 and @xmath26    for the chain described by eqs .",
    "( [ hamall ] ) the total spin in the @xmath7 direction , @xmath27 , is conserved , that is , @xmath28=0 $ ] .",
    "this condition means that the total number of excitations is fixed ; the hamiltonian can not create or annihilate excitations , it can only move them through the chain .",
    "to write the hamiltonian in matrix form and diagonalize it to find its eigenvalues and eigenstates , we need to choose a basis .",
    "the natural choice corresponds to arrays of up and down spins in the @xmath7 direction , as in eqs .",
    "( [ flipflop ] ) , ( [ upup ] ) and ( [ updown ] ) .",
    "we refer to it as the site basis . in this basis , @xmath6 and the ising interaction contribute to the diagonal elements of the matrix , and the flip - flop term leads to the off - diagonal elements .    in the absence of the ising interaction ,",
    "the excitations move freely through the chain . in this case",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenstates can be found analytically . the existence of an analytical method to find the spectrum of a system guarantees its integrability .",
    "the addition of the ising interaction eventually leads to the onset of quantum chaos .",
    "the source of chaos is the interplay between the ising interaction and the defect.@xcite    to bring the system to the chaotic regime , we set @xmath29 ( arbitrary units ) , choose @xmath30 ( arbitrary units ) , and place the defect on site @xmath31 , where @xmath32 stands for the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath33 .",
    "these choices are based on the following factors .",
    "( a ) the strength of the ising interaction can not be much larger than @xmath18 , because if it were , basis vectors with different numbers of pairs of parallel spins would have very different energies and @xmath18 would not be able to effectively couple them .",
    "for example , the energy difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 is @xmath36 ; if we had @xmath37 , the matrix element @xmath38 coupling these two basis vectors would become ineffective . as a result",
    ", the eigenstates would involve only a small portion of the basis vectors , which would mean localized eigenstates and therefore non - chaotic systems .",
    "( b ) the defect can not be placed on the edges of the chain , because it has been shown  @xcite that in this case an analytical solution exists and the system is therefore still integrable .",
    "( c ) we can not have @xmath39 , because this would break the chain in two ; that is , an excitation on one side of the chain would not have enough energy to overcome the defect and reach the other side of the chain . in effect",
    ", we would be dealing with two independent chains described by the xxz model , which is integrable.@xcite",
    "we use the level spacing distribution to identify when the system becomes chaotic .",
    "we analyze also what happens to the structure of the eigenstates once level repulsion occurs .",
    "the distribution @xmath40 of the spacings , @xmath41 , of neighboring energy levels differs depending on the regime of the system.@xcite the energy levels of integrable systems are not correlated , and are not prohibited from crossing , so the distribution is poissonian ( p ) , @xmath42 in chaotic systems the eigenvalues become correlated and crossings are avoided .",
    "there is level repulsion , and @xmath40 is given by the wigner - dyson ( wd ) distribution , as predicted by random matrix theory .",
    "the form of the wigner - dyson distribution depends on the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian .",
    "systems with time reversal invariance are described by a gaussian orthogonal ensemble , which corresponds to an ensemble of real symmetric matrices , whose elements @xmath43 are independent random numbers chosen from a gaussian distribution .",
    "the average of the elements and the variance satisfy @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the level spacing distribution of a gaussian orthogonal ensemble is given by @xmath46    the hamiltonian in eqs .",
    "( [ hamall ] ) is also real and symmetric , so the distribution achieved in the chaotic limit is the same as @xmath47 .",
    "however , our system has only short - range - two - body interactions , so it can not reproduce all features of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble . the density of states , for instance , is gaussian for eqs .",
    "( [ hamall ] ) , but for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble it has the shape of half of a circle .",
    "interested readers can obtain these forms using the codes provided.@xcite another difference is the structure of the eigenstates , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ princomp ] . for gaussian orthogonal ensembles ,",
    "all the eigenstates are statistically similar and highly delocalized , whereas for the hamiltonian in eqs .",
    "( [ hamall ] ) , delocalization is restricted to the middle of the spectrum .    to obtain the level spacing distribution",
    ", we first need to separate the eigenvalues according to their symmetry sectors ( subspaces ) .",
    "if we mix eigenvalues from different symmetry sectors , we can not achieve a wigner - dyson distribution even if the system is chaotic because eigenvalues from different subspaces are independent and therefore uncorrelated , so do not repel each other .",
    "we discuss further the danger of mixing eigenvalues from different symmetry sectors in sec .",
    "[ symm ] . for the moment",
    ", we need to remember only that the hamiltonian in eqs .",
    "( [ hamall ] ) conserves @xmath48 .",
    "this symmetry implies that the hamiltonian matrix is separated into uncoupled blocks , corresponding to subspaces with a fixed number of spins in the up direction . in the following ,",
    "we select a particular subspace with @xmath49 up spins , whose hamiltonian matrix has therefore dimension @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the second essential step before computing the spacing distribution is to unfold the spectrum .",
    "the procedure consists of locally rescaling the energies , so that the local density of states of the renormalized eigenvalues is 1 .",
    "this rescaling allows for the comparison of spectra obtained for different parameters and for different systems .",
    "there are different ways to unfold the spectrum .",
    "a simple and commonly used procedure is to order the spectrum in increasing values of energy ; separate it into several smaller sets of eigenvalues ; and divide each eigenvalue by the mean level spacing of its particular set .",
    "the mean level spacing of the new set of renormalized energies becomes 1 .",
    "because the density of states is the number of states in an interval of energy , that is , the reciprocal of the mean level spacing , this procedure also ensures that the local density of states is unity .",
    "this procedure is the one we used.@xcite    given the unfolded spacings of neighboring levels , the histogram can now be computed . to compare it with the theoretical curves , the distribution needs to be normalized , so that its total area is equal to 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ps ] shows the level spacing distribution when the defect is placed on site 1 and on site @xmath51 .",
    "the first case corresponds to an integrable model and the distribution is a poisson ; the second case is a chaotic system , so the distribution is wigner - dyson .",
    "we now investigate how the transition from a poisson to a wigner - dyson distribution affects the structure of the eigenstates .",
    "in particular , we study how delocalized they are in both regimes .    to determine the spreading of the eigenstates in a particular basis , we look at their components .",
    "consider an eigenstate @xmath52 written in the basis vectors @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "it will be localized if it has the participation of few basis vectors , that is , if a few @xmath55 make significant contributions .",
    "it will be delocalized if many @xmath55 participate with similar values . to quantify this criterion",
    ", we use the sum of the square of the probabilities , @xmath56 ( the sum of the probabilities would not be a good choice , because normalization implies @xmath57 ) , and define the number of principal components of eigenstate @xmath4 as@xcite @xmath58 the number of principal components gives the number of basis vectors which contribute to each eigenstate . it is small when the state is localized and large when the state is delocalized .    for gaussian orthogonal ensembles , the eigenstates are random vectors , that is , the amplitudes @xmath59 are independent random variables .",
    "these states are completely delocalized .",
    "complete delocalization does not mean , however , that the number of principal components is equal to @xmath60 . because the weights @xmath55 fluctuate , the average over the ensemble gives @xmath61.@xcite    to study the number of principal components for eqs .",
    "( [ hamall ] ) , we need to choose a basis .",
    "this choice depends on the question we want to address .",
    "we consider two bases , the site- and mean - field basis .",
    "the site - basis is appropriate when analyzing the spatial delocalization of the system .",
    "to separate regular from chaotic behavior , a more appropriate basis consists of the eigenstates of the integrable limit of the model , which is known as the mean - field basis.@xcite in our case the integrable limit corresponds to eqs .",
    "( [ hamall ] ) with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "we start by writing the hamiltonian in the site - basis .",
    "let us denote these basis vectors by @xmath65 . in the absence of the ising interaction",
    ", the diagonalization of the hamiltonian leads to the mean - field basis vectors .",
    "they are given by @xmath66 .",
    "the diagonalization of the complete matrix , including the ising interaction , gives the eigenstates in the site - basis , @xmath67 .",
    "if we use the relation between @xmath65 and @xmath68 , we may also write the eigenstates of the total hamiltonian in eqs .",

    "the level of delocalization increases significantly in the chaotic regime .",
    "however , contrary to random matrices , the largest values are restricted to the middle of the spectrum , the states at the edges being more localized .",
    "this property is a consequence of the gaussian shape of the density of states of systems with two - body interactions .",
