    ", we will obtain results on the spectrum of infinite discrete covering graphs .",
    "this partially answers a question of sunada concerning the spectrum of infinite discrete graphs @xcite .",
    "in particular , we generalise the so - called _ neumann - dirichlet bracketing _ ( see below ) to the laplacian acting on a metric graph , where the lower bound estimate of the neumann eigenvalue is replaced by the kirchhoff condition . due to an explicit relation between the spectrum of the discrete and ( equilateral ) metric laplacian , we can carry over the eigenvalue estimates to the discrete case .",
    "we also treat the exceptional eigenvalues in this relation ( usually due to the dirichlet spectrum of a single edge ) , and relate them with relative homology of the graph and its boundary .",

    "our basic technique is to localise the eigenvalues within suitable closed intervals which we can control .",

    "one has to fix boundary conditions at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a very elegant way to provide such conditions is to define the laplacian via an associated quadratic form @xmath6 the quadratic form domain is a closed subspace of the sobolev space @xmath7 .",

    "the variational characterisation of the associated eigenvalues is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 runs through all @xmath25-dimensional subspaces and the dot @xmath26 is a placeholder for the labels @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath12 . extending the non - negative forms",
    "@xmath29 naturally to the whole hilbert space by @xmath30 if @xmath31 , the extended forms become monotone in the obvious sense , i.e. @xmath32 for all @xmath33 ( opposite to the inclusion of the domains ) .",
    "it follows now from eq .",
    "that @xmath34 to what we will refer to as _ bracketing_. in this simple example the bracketing does not imply the existence of spectral gaps of @xmath20 inside @xmath35 , since @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and therefore the intervals @xmath39 $ ] cover already @xmath35 .",
    "of course , we do not expect gaps here since @xmath40 .",
    "the strength of this bracketing method can be seen in proposition  [ prp : sp.incl ] where we use the same idea for eigenvalues of equilateral metric graph laplacians and _ arbitrary _ finite - dimensional unitary representations @xmath41 .",
    "proposition  [ prp : sp.incl ] may be seen as the core of our analysis .",
    "its proof is amazingly simple , namely , it is a vector - valued generalisation of the above argument .",
    "let us briefly describe our main results : denote by @xmath42 the eigenspace of the standard ( kirchhoff ) metric laplacian , and by @xmath43 the eigenspace of the standard discrete laplacian ( for precise definitions , see sections  [ sec : dg ] and  [ sec : mg ] ) .",
    "the following theorem resumes propositions  [ prp : sp.rel ] ,  [ prp : dec.spaces ] and  [ prp : hom.ef ] , where the precise statements can be found .",
    "the first statement for equilateral graphs ( i.e. , metric graphs with constant length function , say , @xmath44 ) is standard ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and only mentioned for completeness :    let @xmath45 be a compact , connected and equilateral metric graph and set @xmath46 .    1 .",

    "_ topological _ eigenfunctions of the metric graph .",
    "the orthogonal complement of the range of @xmath53 contains an additional eigenfunction @xmath54 which is constant as function restricted to the set of vertices , called _",
    "trivial vertex based_.    for shortness , we omit the case @xmath50 odd , in which a similar statement with @xmath52 replaced by the `` unoriented '' homology group @xmath55 holds . in this case",
    ", one has to distinguish whether @xmath56 is bipartite or not . in the former case",
    ", the orthogonal complement of the range of @xmath53 contains the additional eigenfunction @xmath54 related to the discrete bipartite eigenfunction . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath53 is already an isomorphism .",
    "moreover , a similar result holds when we consider laplacians with dirichlet conditions on a subset @xmath57 of the vertices . in this case , the _ relative _ homology group @xmath58 enters .",
    "the multiplicities of the eigenvalues were already calculated in  @xcite by a direct proof without using the homology groups .",
    "the advantage of using homology groups is that is can be generalised to other types of vertex boundary conditions ( like dirichlet and equivariant ) in a natural way , see e.g.  remark  [ rem : twisted.hom ] ) .",
    "let now @xmath59 be a covering of metric graphs ( i.e. , a covering respecting the combinatorial graph structure and the length function ) .",
    "for the next statement , the metric graph need not to be equilateral .",

    "we refer to the intervals @xmath69 as _ kirchhoff - dirichlet ( kd ) intervals_. note that they depend usually on the fundamental domain .",
    "the kirchhoff condition plays the role of the neumann condition in the usual _ dirichlet - neumann _ bracketing .",
    "note that the kirchhoff condition is optimal in a sense made precise in remark  [ rem : kir.opt ] , namely that a symmetrised version of the kd intervals ( explained below ) give the exact spectrum of the corresponding ( abelian ) covering laplacian .",
    "we call the set @xmath70 also a _ spectral gap_. note that we do not assume that the spectral gap is _ maximal _ , i.e. , if we state that the spectrum has two disjoint gaps @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 we do not make a statement about the existence of spectrum inside @xmath74 $ ] . in certain situations ( e.g.  if @xmath60 is amenable ) , we can assure the existence of spectrum between the gaps , and therefore have a lower bound on the number of components of @xmath75 in terms of the components of @xmath76 ( see theorem  [ thm : amenable ] ) .    for an equilateral metric graph",
    ", we can combine the last two theorems and obtain the following _ discrete kirchhoff - dirichlet bracketing_. let @xmath77 be a covering of discrete graphs with fundamental domain @xmath78 ( being a subgraph of @xmath56 with vertex set @xmath79 and boundary @xmath57 ) :    assume that the covering group is residually finite , then @xmath80,\\ ] ] where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the eigenvalues of the discrete laplacians on the fundamental domain @xmath78 with dirichlet condition on @xmath57 in the latter case . in particular , for any subset",

    "we refer to the intervals @xmath85 as the _ discrete kirchhoff - dirichlet intervals_. note that this method allows to determine in a very easy way whether a set @xmath70 is not contained in the spectrum of the covering laplacian .",
    "the only step to be done is to calculate the eigenvalues @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( which give immediately the corresponding metric eigenvalues for equilateral graphs ) and check whether neighbouring kd intervals @xmath86 have empty intersection .",
    "we will see in section  [ sec : ex ] , that in simple examples , only the first kd intervals do not overlap . as in the case of manifolds and schrdinger operators ( see e.g.  @xcite ) we expect that the number of gaps should be large if the fundamental domain has `` small '' boundary @xmath57 compared to the number of vertices @xmath79 and edges @xmath87 inside . in other words , a `` high contrast '' between the different copies of a suitable fundamental domain is necessary in order that our method works .",
    "it is a priori not clear how the eigenvalue bracketing can be seen directly for discrete laplacians , so our analysis may serve as an example of how to use metric graphs to obtain results for discrete graphs .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the following two sections we present the basic definitions and results for various laplacians on discrete and metric graphs . sections",

    "the corresponding ( co-)homologies for @xmath131 and @xmath148 will be useful in order to analyse exceptional metric graph eigenfunctions composed of antisymmetric and symmetric dirichlet eigenfunctions on a single edge ( see section  [ sec : hom ] ) .",
