    "currently , starburst99 includes two different evolutionary tracks produced by the geneva group , which differ primarily in their treatment of mass loss rates for massive stars .",
    "mass loss rates are a critical parameter when considering the contributions of massive stars to ism enrichment ( maeder & conti 1994 ) .",
    "the  standard \" ( std ) mass loss evolutionary tracks were originally published in a series of papers by the geneva group ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 ; schaerer et al .  1993a , 1993b ; charbonnel et al .",
    "these models adopt mass loss rates throughout the hr diagram from de jager et al .",

    "( 1989 ) , where @xmath36 .",
    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are an exception - the mass loss rates for these stars are taken from langer ( 1989 ) and conti ( 1988 ) and include no correction for initial metallicity effects .",
    "the  high \" mass loss evolutionary tracks ( high ) , published in meynet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , include enhanced mass loss rates , meant to more accurately reproduce observations of low - luminosity wolf - rayet stars and blue - to - red supergiant ratios in the magellanic clouds ( schaller et al .  1992 ,",
    "meynet 1993 ) .",
    "the adopted mass loss rates are derived by doubling the rates adopted by the  standard \" grid from de jager et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , as well as doubling the  standard \" mass loss rate assumed for late - type wn - type wr stars .",
    "the mass - loss rates for early - type wn wr stars and later stages of wr stars ( wc and wo ) were left unchanged - for a complete discussion , see meynet et al .",
    "again , the mass loss rates of wr stars are left uncorrected for initial metallicity effects .    while many advances have since been made in our understanding of stellar physics ,",
    "adopting these tracks in our stellar population synthesis models is still scientifically sound .",
    "the std mass loss tracks are the more applicable of the two when considering recent work on the effect that wind clumping has on mass loss rates ( crowther et al .",
    "2002 ) ; however , the high mass loss tracks produce a reasonable approximation of the enhanced mass loss rates resulting from the effects of rotation , when surface mixing results in an earlier start of the wr phase ( meynet , private communication ) .",
    "rotation is an important component of stellar evolution that is expected to have considerable influence on the starburst99 ionizing spectrum and the agreement of these models with observations at low metallicity in particular ( leitherer 2008 ) .",
    "since the effects of rotation are not explicitly included in these tracks , the high mass loss tracks can be considered a more appropriate approximation of the rotation - driven mass loss undergone by massive stars .",
    "the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) ionizing spectra produced by starburst99 are primarily influenced by age and metallicity .",
    "the effects of a changing model age derive largely from the evolution of the massive stellar population , and are easily examined in our models which adopt an instantaneous burst model of star formation - this star formation history allows us to observe the effects of a single stellar population that is formed at 0 myr and evolves uniformly .",
    "by contrast , for the continuous sfh models , we set the age constant at 5 myr .",
    "this age describes an active ( emission - line ) star - forming galaxy , where the number of stars being formed is equal to the number of stars dying . at younger ages",
    "this equilibrium is not yet reached , and at older ages there is little to no evolution in the fuv ionizing spectrum produced by the stellar population .",
    "this is consistent with the evolution of continuous sfh models for starburst galaxies , as described in kewley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "figure 1 ( left ) shows the fuv spectra generated when adopting an instantaneous burst sfh and the high evolutionary tracks , plotted from 0 myr to 6 myr in 1 myr increments for our full range of metallicities .",
    "the hardness of the spectra decreases with age for this star formation history , most noticeably in the higher - energy regime of the spectra ( 100 - 300 ) , a result of the massive stellar population evolving out of the ob main sequence phase .",
    "it is apparent that the behavior of the fuv spectrum differs dramatically across the different metallicities .",
    "the low - metallicity spectra maintain a significantly harder ionizing spectrum throughout their evolution as compared to the @xmath18 and @xmath20 model spectra .",
    "since high - metallicity stars spend a larger fraction of their high - energy photons ionizing their own atmospheric metals ( due to the increased effects of line blanketing ) , there is a resulting depletion of high - energy photons available to ionize the surrounding ism , which leads to a softer radiation field ( snijders et al .",
    ". the effective temperatures of massive stars are also higher at lower metallicities across similar spectral types due to a shift of the evolutionary limits of hydrodynamic equilibrium ( the hayashi limit ) to warmer temperatures at lower metallicities ( elias et al .  1985 ; levesque et al .",
    "2006 ) , resulting in a hotter environment and harder spectrum in the case of our low - metallicity spectra .",
    "finally , main sequence lifetimes are longer at low metallicities as a result of lower mass loss rates , leading to a greater amount of time spent in the hot main - sequence evolutionary phases and a larger contribution to the ionizing radiation field that extends to later ages ( e.g. meynet et al .  1994 ,",
    "maeder & conti 1994 ) .",
    "figure 1 ( left ) also indicates that the wolf - rayet ( w - r ) phase for these galaxies contributes to a hardening of the ionizing spectrum , producing a distinctive bump in the high - energy region of the spectrum .",
    "the net effect of this population is only visible in the high - z ionizing spectra , appearing from 3 to 5 myr in the @xmath18 spectrum , and from 4 to 6 myr in the @xmath20 .",
    "the wind - driven ism enhancement by w - r stars is stronger and longer at high metallicities , and the minimum mass required to reach the w - r stage decreases at higher metallicities ( taken to be 85 m@xmath8 at @xmath12 as compared to 40m@xmath8 at @xmath18 for the geneva models used here ; schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "however , the most pronounced change in the spectra occurs at ages later than 5 myr . for the 6 myr model",
    ", there is a dramatic drop in the hardness of the spectra at @xmath37 225  , coinciding almost perfectly with the ionizing wavelength of [ oiii ] .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the origin of the fuv spectrum for this sfh .",
    "an instantaneous burst of star - formation at 0 myr will result in a single coeval population of massive stars as the sole source of ionizing radiation , decreasing the hardness of the fuv spectrum at later ages as the hottest massive stars ( and therefore the dominant contributors of ionizing radiation ) , evolve rapidly off the main sequence and end their lives .",
    "the lifetimes employed in the geneva models give the explanation for the behavior of the fuv spectra shown here ; the main - sequence ( h - burning phase ) lifetimes of a typical hot massive star of initial mass 40 m@xmath8 all terminate at an age of 5 myr or earlier ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 , schaerer et al .  1993b , charbonnel et al .",
    "1993 ) . as a result ,",
    "beyond 5 myr the dominant massive stellar population is comprised mainly of lower - mass ( @xmath38 25 m@xmath8 ) stars that are beginning to evolve redwards on the hertzsprung - russell diagram , and producing insufficient ionizing radiation at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath39 225  ) to generate the line fluxes we observe for highly ionized species . because of this lack of ionizing photons , we restrict our photoionization grids generated for an instantaneous star formation history to 5 myr and younger .    in practice , stellar populations in star - forming galaxies are thought to originate from episodic bursts of star formation , or from a continuous sfh .",
    "for example , izotov & thuan ( 2004 ) find evidence of current ongoing star formation with an age of about 4 myr in the extremely low - metallicity galaxy i zw 18 .",
    "in addition , they detect supergiant populations that indicate an intense star formation episode occuring 10 - 15 myr ago and evidence of still older stellar populations with ages of hundreds of myr .",
    "noeske et al .",
    "( 2007a , 2007b ) examine 2905 star - forming galaxies from the all wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) , and find that the dominant star formation mechanism in these galaxies appears to be a gradual decline of the average star formation rate , as opposed to a series of episodic bursts that decrease in frequency .",
    "previous grids of stellar population synthesis models also find that the assumption of a continuous sfh , with the presence of underlying older stellar populations , is more appropriate than a single instantaneous burst in most cases ( kewley et al .",
    "2001 , moy et al .",
    "2001 , fernandes et al .",
    "2003 , barton et al .",
    "this suggests that , rather than modeling a _ single _ burst of star - formation at 0 myr ( the current approach in starburst99 for a burst - like sfh ) , a continuous sfh or multiple bursts of star formation through time would be a more realistic treatment for modeling spectra of star - forming galaxies ( see also lee et al .",
    "the instantaneous burst models presented here can therefore be employed mainly as an _ approximation _ of a burst - like sfh , representing a lower limit on star formation , while our continuous star formation models can be considered an upper limit .    after examining the behavior of the fuv spectra when adopting the high evolutionary tracks",
    ", we can then compare these to the fuv spectra produced from the std evolutionary tracks , subtracting the two spectra to examine their differences in greater detail ( figure 1 , right ) . in this comparison",
    ", we can see that the largest differences occur at higher metallicities ( @xmath40 , and 2@xmath41 ) and in the 3 to 6 myr age range , coinciding with the ionizing flux contribution of the mass - loss - sensitive wolf - rayet phase .",
    "additional discrepancies at later ages focus on the age of the 225  drop , which is also expected to vary slightly with mass loss .    finally , we find that the fuv spectra shown here are harder than those shown in kewley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for both the pegase and the starburst99 stellar population synthesis models .",
    "the increased hardness between 225  and 1000  is particularly notable , with log(@xmath3f@xmath42 , ergs s@xmath22 m@xmath43 ) @xmath44 25 to 30 for the solar - metallicity kewley et al .",

    "( 2001 ) and hillier & miller ( 1998 ) model atmospheres .",
    "these fuv spectra are therefore a notable improvement over the kewley et al .",

    "this figure illustrates that the [ sii ] flux in particular is a good tracer of the hardness of the ionizing radiation field .",

    "this result is surprising considering the speculation by kewley et al .",

    "however , it is clear that more substantial improvements in models of star - forming galaxies will require further systematic changes in existing stellar population synthesis and photoionization codes .",
    "we have generated an extensive suite of models for star - forming galaxies , utilizing the newest generation of the starburst99 stellar population synthesis code and the mappings iii photoionization code . with these codes",
    "we have constructed a grid of models with a variety of metallicities and ionization parameters , adopting both an instantaneous burst sfh and a continuous sfh as well as both the high and std mass loss prescriptions from the evolutionary tracks of the geneva group .",
    "this grids have been made available to the public , and are being used to develop updated metallicity diagnostics as part of a current hst theory grant ( p.i .",
    "kewley ) , with a publication of new diagnostics expected within the next few months .",
    "we have examined the ionizing spectrum generated by starburst99 for these models , along with the evolution of a number of optical emission line diagnostic ratios with time .",
    "we have selected a number of local ( @xmath0 ) star - forming galaxies as a comparison sample , from data release 4 of sdss ( kewley et al .",

    "we are able to make the following conclusions :    \\(1 ) models that assume a continuous sfh at 5.0 myr produce a harder fuv ionizing spectrum and show better agreement with the observed emission line ratios of our galaxy sample as compared to models with an instantaneous burst sfh at 5.0 myr .",
    "this is in accordance with past work that suggests a continuous treatment of star formation is more realistic than a single zero - age instantaneous burst when modeling star - forming galaxies ( kewley et al .",
    "2001 , moy et al .",

    "\\(2 ) assumption of either the high or std geneva mass loss rates is found to make very little difference in the precision of the continuous sfh models ; however , in the case of the instantaneous burst models , the high mass loss rates produce better agreement with our galaxy sample , suggesting that an enhanced rate of mass loss is more realistic under the assumption of an instantaneous burst .",
    "\\(3 ) from the [ nii]/h@xmath1 vs. [ oiii]/h@xmath2 and [ nii]/[oii ] vs. [ oiii]/[oii ] diagnostic diagrams , we find that the metallicity and ionization parameter range of our models are in agreement with the ism properties of the galaxies in our comparison sample , including our low - metallicity galaxy sample . we find that that these metal - poor galaxies appear to include both lower metallicities _ and _ higher ionization parameters than our general local galaxy sample .",
    "\\(4 ) from the [ sii]/h@xmath1 vs. [ oiii]/h@xmath2 diagnostic diagram , it appears that our models still produce an insufficiently hard fuv ionizing spectrum that can not fully reproduce some of the line fluxes observed in our galaxy sample .",
    "\\(5 ) our models of a single luminosity - weighted hii region are comparable in precision to models such as those presented in dopita et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which integrate the spectra of multiple hii regions when modeling star - forming galaxies .",
    "it is important to note that these models still include several shortcomings that must be considered when applying them to star - forming galaxies and considering future work in this area",
    ". one ongoing challenge we must consider is the required hardness of the fuv ionizing spectrum .",
    "the starburst99 stellar population synthesis models shown here have a considerably harder fuv ionizing spectrum in the 225  to 1000  regime than the kewley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) models , a regime that is critical in ionizing the forbidden optical emission lines used in these analyses .",
    "this is a consequence of adopting the pauldrach et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and hillier & miller ( 1998 ) model atmospheres , which include detailed treatments of metal opacities , an improvement originally proposed in kewley et al .",
    "however , our results show that the models still do not produce sufficient flux in the fuv ionizing spectrum ; this is most evident in the case of the [ sii]/h@xmath1 vs. [ oiii]/h@xmath2 diagnostic .",
    "[ sii ] in particular requires a larger partially ionized zone generated by a harder radiation field in the models before it can properly reproduce the fluxes observed in our galaxy samples .",
    "this suggests that further systematic changes are required in the stellar population synthesis models to produce harder fuv ionizing spectra .",
    "one potential means of addressing this issue could be the adoption of stellar evolutionary tracks that include the effects of rotation on the stellar population , such as the new generation of geneva evolutionary tracks presented in vzquez et al .",
    "starburst99 outputs generated using the @xmath17 rotating geneva models have been made available to us ( leitherer , personal communication ) , allowing us to examine the effect that rotation has on the ionizing radiation field produced by this code .",
    "figure 11 shows a comparison of the fuv ionizing spectra generated by starburst99 when adopting the high , std , and rotating models of the geneva group ; it is evident that evolutionary tracks that include rotation produce an ionizing spectrum that is in general harder than either of the tracks employed in this work , with the difference becoming most pronounced at wavelengths shorter than @xmath37225 .",
    "this is precisely the effect that would be anticipated as a result of including rotation in massive stellar evolutionary models . as just one example of the changes expected with these new tracks ,",
    "massive stars are found to be hotter and more luminous than previously thought , leading to a hardening of the sed that is most prominent in the higher - energy regime of the spectrum ( leitherer et al .",
    "in particular , these rotation effects are expected to become more pronounced at lower metallicity , as rotation eventually becomes a dominant parameter in the evolution of extremely metal - poor stars ( hirschi et al .",
    "2008 , leitherer et al .  2008 ) .",
    "we plan to expand our current grid of evolutionary models by generating a new set of starburst99/mappings iii synthetic spectra once the full grid of geneva evolutionary tracks with rotation are available .    in summary , we find that our stellar population synthesis and photoionization models of a single luminosity - weighted hii region , adopting a continuous sfh , reproduce the line ratios of up to 91% of the local population of star - formation galaxies , as well as up to 86% of the low - metallicity population .",
    "these models will allow us to study the ism properties of metal - poor galaxies in unprecedented detail , allowing study of the pre - enrichment ism that could shed new light on star formation processes and mechanisms of ism enrichment ( brown et al .",
    "models of low - metallicity galaxies can also be used to probe potential evolutionary mechanisms for metal - poor environments ( kewley et al .",
    "finally , a thorough understanding of metal - poor galaxies and their stellar populations could prove beneficial to studying the host galaxies of long - duration gamma - ray bursts , which are thought to be low - metallicity ( stanek et al .",
    "2006 , fruchter et al .",
    "2006 , kewley et al .",
    "2007 , modjaz et al .  2008 ) .",
    "these models still include several shortcomings that must be considered , in particular their production of an insufficiently hard fuv ionizing spectrum that specifically affects the [ sii ] emission line strength .",
    "future model grids that include the effects of rotation on the stellar population may help to resolve this issue .",

    "<S> we use the newest generation of the starburst99/mappings code to generate an extensive suite of models to facilitate detailed studies of star - forming galaxies and their ism properties , particularly at low metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> the new models used include a rigorous treatment of metal opacities in the population synthesis modeling and more detailed dust physics in the photoionization code . </S>",
    "<S> these models span a wide range of physical parameters including metallicity , ionization parameter , and the adoption of both a instantaneous burst and continuous star formation history . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the agreement between our models and local ( @xmath0 ) star - forming galaxy populations from several large datasets , including the sloan digital sky survey , the nearby field galaxy survey , and samples of blue compact galaxies and metal - poor galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that models adopting a continuous star formation history reproduce the metallicity - sensitive line ratios observed in the local population of star - forming galaxies , including the low - metallicity sample . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the current codes generate an insufficiently hard ionizing radiation field , leading to deficiencies in the [ sii ] fluxes produced by the models . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the advantages and short - comings of this suite of models , and discuss future work and improvements that can be applied to the modeling of star - forming galaxies . </S>"
