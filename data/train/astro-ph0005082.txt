    "many bright x - ray sources in globular clusters are x - ray bursters .",
    "the source in terzan  2 , the metal - rich cluster located in the galactic center field , is likely the most peculiar one . in 1975",
    "september a strong ( @xmath1 crab in a peak flux ) and long ( @xmath2s ) burst was detected from the region by ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite was the first who associated it with terzan  2 and noted that the source 4u1722@xmath330 could be its persistent counterpart .",
    "the source position in the _ uhuru _ catalogue was found affected by contamination of nearby sources .",
    "after correction for this effect the coincidence in positions of the source , the burster and terzan  2 became obvious .",
    "since that time the source is known as u.    the identification of the burster with the cluster was confirmed during the second x - ray burst detected by the _ einstein _",
    "hri in 1979 march ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source was localized to be within the cluster core of @xmath4  in radius ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent rosat hri images ( @xcite ) also revealed a single source less than 2  off the position determined by _",
    "einstein_.    since 1979",
    "only two new x - ray bursts were reported from the source in addition to the two already mentioned .",
    "the one was detected by the telescope on board _ granat _ in 1992 february ( @xcite ) and another  by the mecs spectrometer on board in 1996 august ( @xcite ) .",
    "all the four reported bursts were extremely bright with short rise and long decay time scales that is a characteristic of the type  i bursts .",
    "for all the bursts the complex spectral behaviour was observed during the initial phase along with the gradual spectral softening during the decay phase . in spite of such similarity some features in the burst profile detected with ( see fig.[totcur ] ) made that event to be different from the other ones .",
    "in particular , a strong narrow precursor was detected a few seconds before the beginning of the primary peak that was a direct evidence for the nearly eddington luminosity and quick photospheric radius expansion of a neutron star in u. in this letter we present and discuss the first results of timing and spectroscopy for another exceptionally bright x - ray burst with strong photospheric radius expansion which was detected from u  by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer_.",
    "in 1996 - 1998 u  was observed by rxte many times with a total exposure exceeding 330  ks but with the only x - ray burst detected .",
    "this event occurred on november 8 , 1996 during the first orbit of the observation started at 6:58 a.m. ( ut ) .",
    "all the five units of the proportional counter array ( pca ) were operated that time .",
    "the burst profile in the 2 - 60 kev energy band ( which is presented in fig.[totcur ] and discussed below ) is based on the standard-1 mode data taken from the pca xenon layers .",
    "these are the data without energy resolution . for the spectral analysis",
    "the burst catcher mode data were used recorded in 64 energy channels with 2-ms time resolution .",
    "this mode , adapted to high count rate , was unfortunately switching off all the time when the rate fell below @xmath5 cts / s , e.g. during the period taken place between the precursor and primary event .",
    "the data in the science event mode could not be used because of strong memory restrictions and long ( 8  s ) `` readout '' time . to measure the spectra just before and in @xmath6 s after the burst we used the standard-2 mode data with the 16-s integration time .",
    "our research is focused on the x - ray burst only .",
    "spectral and timing properties of the source persistent emission were investigated with rxte earlier and reported by olive et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and barret et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "fig.[totcur]@xmath7 shows the temporal profile of the burst in the broad pca energy band with 0.5-s time resolution .",
    "the moment `` 0 '' corresponds to 7:00:03 a.m. ( ut ) .",
    "the burst began with an extremely strong ( @xmath8 crab ) precursor event which lasted @xmath9  s. then a 2-s quiet interval was observed during which the flux fell by @xmath10 times from the level measured before the burst .",
    "the drop is well seen in the insertion to fig.[totcur ] .",
    "a weak burst ( the second precursor ) followed this time interval and gave a start for the primary event .",
    "the second precursor was about 1.5-s long and a factor of 6 weaker than the first one .",
    "the primary event itself was @xmath11 crab in a peak and had rather a complex shape and a duration in excess of 150  s. in general the observed profile was very similar to that detected by from u  on february 17 , 1992 ( fig.[totcur]@xmath12 ) .",
    "the coincidence could be even better if the profiles obtained by pca at high @xmath13 kev energies ( where art - p was most sensitive ) were used ( fig.[lcurv ] ) . being a coded - mask telescope localized its burst with a few arcmin accuracy and identified it with terzan  2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the similarity in the two profiles allows us to conclude that the burst detected by pca occurred in the same source .",
    "= 91.5 mm    = 89.5 mm    in fig.[lcurv ] we show the pca count rate as a function of time in four different energy bands .",
    "the moment  0  is the same as in fig.[totcur ] .",
    "the gap in the data in 3.25 - 7.75  s after the precursor onset resulted from the burst catcher mode switching off mentioned in sec.2 .",
    "the figure exhibits several notable features in the burst and precursor profiles .",
    "it shows that although the first rise in the flux occurred simultaneously and at nearly the same rate in all bands , the time of reaching the maximum and the typical time scale of the flux decline were different in the soft and hard bands . during the precursor",
    "the peak flux was reached in @xmath14 and @xmath15  s after the onset in the and 16 - 25 kev bands , respectively .",
    "thus , the precursor was longer in the soft band . on the contrary , during the primary event the rise in the soft flux was much prompter and the peak",
    "was reached in @xmath16 and 27  s in the same bands .",
    "the peak observed at high energies was accompanied by a dip - like feature in the 3.15 - 7.9 kev light curve .",
    "such behaviour reflected strong changes in the source hardness occurred during the burst .",
    "the bottom panel in fig.[lcurv ] indicates that the maximum hardness was observed twice  during the precursor ( in @xmath17  s after the onset ) and during the primary event ( in @xmath18  s ) . and",
    "it slowly decreased during the decay of both events . remarkably that the second precursor was connected with the rise in the soft flux only .",
    "fig.[propane ] shows the burst profile taken from the propane anodes of pca which are sensitive to very soft ( @xmath19  kev ) photons . in this band",
    "the second precursor was comparable in strength with the first one .",
    "the bottom panel shows the hard x - ray profile from the xenon anodes ( the same as in fig.[totcur ] but with better time resolution ) .",
    "note that both the profiles are given here without background subtraction .",
    "a long exponential decay present in the profile beginning since @xmath20  s is a characteristic of the type i bursts . using the data for the first 60  s of the decay we estimated its time scale to be @xmath21  s at low energies and decreasing to @xmath22  s at high energies .",
    "the strong observed precursor comparable in a peak flux with the primary event was on the contrary a completely unusual feature for bursts .",
    "although bursts with precursors were observed earlier ( @xcite ) , u  was likely the first source in which the precursors were so powerful .",
    "for further analysis we got more than 100 consecutive photon spectra with an integration time of 0.25  s ( to cover the precursor and the rise phase of the primary event ) and 1  s ( to cover the rest part of the burst ) . the spectra were approximated in the kev band with the black body model .",
    "the interstellar absorption was taken into account with @xmath23 fixed at @xmath24 ( as measured by asca , see @xcite ) .",
    "the persistent spectrum was not subtracted .",
    "the drop in its flux by a factor of 8 which followed the precursor has shown that the persistent source was hidden by the expanding photosphere or suppressed by huge energy release in the burst .",
    "it is unclear when the flux was able to recover and what the level was .",
    "the hexte spectrometer which could clarify this point had insufficient sensitivity at short time scales .",
    "we will see that neglect by the persistent emission was not crucial for our analysis because of exceptional power of this burst .",
    "= 96.5 mm    fig .",
    "[ spec ] presents several typical spectra of the source at different phases of the burst .",
    "the best - fit approximation is shown by solid lines . the persistent spectrum accumulated during 16  s before the burst and adequately fitted by the absorbed power law model with the photon index @xmath25 is shown by triangles in the bottom panel and indicated by dashed lines in the other panels .",
    "note that the spectrum measured at @xmath26  s exhibits the lack of x - rays at @xmath27 kev in comparison with the persistent one .",
    "note also that the spectrum measured at @xmath28  s , in the far tail of the burst , points on the persistent emission recovery and its contribution to the flux at @xmath29 kev .",
    "the spectrum obtained in 300  s after the onset was already very coincident with that observed before the burst .",
    "the figure explains the evolution of the source hardness described in sec .",
    "3 . just after the onset ( in 0.5  s ) the source had a hard spectrum corresponding to the black body temperature @xmath30 kev .",
    "the temperature fell by 4 times during the next 2  s. after the gap in the pca data , @xmath31 again was found to be small @xmath32 kev but it quickly rose and reached @xmath33 kev in @xmath34  s after the onset .",
    "the gradual decrease of @xmath31 followed this maximum and continued up to the end of the observation .",
    "the detailed information on the evolution of spectral parameters ( @xmath31 and @xmath35  the black body radius of the neutron star photosphere ) is presented in fig.[param ] . in the same figure",
    "we show the source bolometric luminosity @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the stefan - boltzmann constant ) as a function of time .",
    "the distance to terzan  2 was taken to be 6.6  kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "fig.[param ] shows that the initial ( @xmath38  s ) stage of the burst was connected with strong photospheric expansion ( during the precursor ) and contraction ( during the primary event ) .",
    "the observed radii were in excess of 70 km , velocities  of @xmath39 .",
    "the peak value of the luminosity , @xmath40 , was equal to the eddington limit for a @xmath41 neutron star and helium - rich material . while expanding , the photosphere got cool , its spectrum softened and the fraction of photons with energies within the pca band decreased .",
    "that was the reason why the first narrow precursor appeared in the burst profile .",
    "the dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath35 during photospheric expansion and contraction is shown in fig.[depend ] by filled and open circles , respectively .",
    "it could be described by a single law @xmath43 with @xmath44 which implies that the luminosity @xmath45 slowly decreased while the radius increased in contrast with the usual suggestion that it remains constant and very close to the eddington limit ( @xcite ) .",
    "this issue may however be hasty taking into account that our simple spectral modeling ignored distortions produced in the spectrum by comptonization in the outer layers of the photosphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "comptonization may be also responsible for the decrease in @xmath35 observed in @xmath46 and 27 s after the onset ( in comparison with the value @xmath47 km found in the burst tail ) .",
    "the total emitted energy @xmath48 thus the mass of exploded matter @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the efficiency of helium burning .",
    "the thomson depth of such matter @xmath51 really , only its small part could be involved in expansion .",
    "for a few seconds after the precursor , the photosphere , extended but still opaque , completely hid the region in which the gravitational energy of accreted matter was released .",
    "the flux from the source fell below the persistent level .",
    "it is unclear however whether the accretion efficiency was at the persistent level , @xmath52 , that time",
    ". the burst could destroy process of steady accretion onto the source .",
    "the photospheric sound crossing time @xmath53 increased during expansion and could reach seconds if @xmath35 exceeded a few @xmath54 km .",
    "respectively , the second precursor in the burst profile could be explained by photospheric oscillations .",
    "this research based on the data obtained through the heasarc online service .",
