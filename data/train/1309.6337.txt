    "understanding radiation damage phenomena in nuclear materials is important for predicting the mechanical behavior of current and future nuclear power reactors @xcite .",
    "in particular , future fusion reactors will produce a much larger amount of both he and h as compared to fission reactors , hence the microstructure of the structural materials used in fusion reactors will be much more sensitive to interactions with he defects @xcite . in terms of radiation damage , the production of helium through ( n,@xmath0 ) transmutation reactions",
    "causes both microstructure evolution and drastic property changes in the first - wall and blanket structural materials of fusion reactors .",
    "the production of single helium atoms and small he clusters in the metal lattice is inherently a problem that occurs at the nanoscale .",
    "the subsequent diffusion of he and he clusters results in the nucleation and growth of he bubbles on grain boundaries and within the lattice , which lead to a macroscopic deterioration of material properties including void swelling , surface roughening and blistering , and high temperature intergranular embrittlement ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",

    "while the production and diffusion of he occurs at the nanoscale , these other processes develop at larger length scales over long time scales , which necessitates developing predictive multiscale models for material behavior under irradiation conditions that couples multiple simulation methods at different length and time scales . developing this predictive capability",
    "will require an understanding of the mechanisms associated with radiation damage phenomena , of the he interaction with microstructures , and of the associated uncertainties .",
    "it is well known that he interactions in fe play an important role in the mechanical behavior of steel alloys .",
    "there have been a number of quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations that have examined how he and he clusters affect single crystal lattice properties and physical properties in @xmath0-fe @xcite .",
    "for instance , density functional theory ( dft ) simulations have been used to show that interstitial he atoms strongly interact with vacancies and can also be trapped by interstitial atoms ( binding energy of 0.3 ev ) @xcite .",
    "ventelon , wirth , and domain @xcite probed the interactions between he and self - interstitial atoms ( sias ) in @xmath0-fe and found strong binding behavior between interstitial he and sia clusters , which corresponded with the sia defect strain field .",
    "other atomistic studies have examined how he and h interact within the single crystal lattice to form complex he  h clusters @xcite or how he impacts the production of irradiation - induced point defects in an fe  cr matrix @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently used several fe - he potentials @xcite to show the effect of the interatomic potential on the resulting dynamics of he transport and he clustering in fe .",
    "ascertaining the reactions that occur and quantifying their energetics are very important for a fundamental understanding of how point defects , impurities , substitutional atoms , and helium atoms interact in the single crystal lattice of @xmath0-fe . furthermore , this information is useful for models that explore the kinetics of he diffusion , trapping ( clustering ) , and detrapping ( emission ) , such as rate theory models @xcite , kinetic monte carlo models @xcite , and/or phase field models @xcite .",
    "grain boundaries within these alloy systems can also play a significant role in trapping these point defects and atomic species . despite this fact ,",
    "there have been relatively few studies that have focused on he interactions with grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "these prior works have been significant for understanding the migration paths and mechanisms of he for a few boundaries using the dimer method @xcite , understanding migration of interstitial he in different grain boundaries using molecular dynamics @xcite , understanding how the grain boundary strength is affected by he @xcite or he bubbles @xcite , or understanding the diffusion and stability of he defects in grain boundaries using first principles @xcite .",
    "for instance , kurtz and heinisch @xcite used a finnis  sinclair potential ( detailed in morishita et al .",
    "@xcite ) to show that interstitial he was more strongly bound to the grain boundary core than substitutional he .",
    "kurtz and heinisch also found that the maximum he binding energy increases linearly with the grain boundary excess free volume , similar to prior work in fcc nickel @xcite . in subsequent studies , gao ,",
    "heinisch , and kurtz @xcite found a relationship between the maximum binding energy and grain boundary energy as well .",
    "additionally , gao et al .  started to detail the diffusion trajectories of interstitial and substitutional he atoms along a @xmath3 and @xmath5 grain boundary and found that the dimensionality of migration of interstitial he may depend on temperature ( e.g. , in the @xmath3112 boundary ) . some recent work has utilized first principles to quantify binding strengths of he and he - vacancy clusters at the @xmath6310 symmetric tilt grain boundary @xcite .",
    "there are still a number of unresolved issues relating to how he interacts with grain boundaries , though .",
    "for instance , these studies often focus on one he atom in interstitial or substitutional sites , but often do not extend to multiple he atoms interacting with grain boundary sites .",
    "also , atomistic studies often have not examined a wide range of grain boundary structures to understand the influence of macroscopic variables on he interactions . moreover , while the highly non - uniform he binding energies in the grain boundary core have been previously pointed out @xcite , relating these to per - atom metrics based on the grain boundary local environment has not been pursued as frequently . additionally , while there is an increasing awareness of interatomic potential effects , many of the interatomic potentials used previously for some of these grain boundary studies have been improved upon with updated interatomic potential formulations @xcite and/or more recent quantum mechanics results showing how magnetism affects he defects in @xmath0-fe @xcite .",
    "last , reconciling the molecular statics simulations of he binding to grain boundaries with recent long time dynamics approaches @xcite can shed light on the migration and trapping / detrapping efficiency of these different grain boundaries .",
    "hence , in the present work , we have focused on how the local grain boundary structure interacts with he atoms and how the local atomic environment at the boundary influences the binding energetics of 12 atom substitutional and interstitial he defects .",
    "recently , tschopp and colleagues utilized an iterative approach to systematically quantify the interactions between point defects , carbon , and hydrogen with fe grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "herein , this approach is extended by using multiple different starting positions , or instantiations , about each site to more precisely probe the formation and binding energy landscape about ten grain boundaries . in this paper",
    ", we present this extended approach as it applies to four he defects and explore how the grain boundary structure affects the interaction of these four he defects using both molecular static and long time dynamic calculations .",
    "moreover , we have also explored how different per - atom local environment metrics compare with the calculated energies for the different he defects .",
    "a number of interesting new findings emerge from the present study .",
    "for instance , we find that the @xmath3112 twin boundary in bcc fe possesses a much smaller binding energy than other boundaries , which corresponds in long time dynamics simulations to the ability of an interstitial he defect to break away from the boundary in simulations on the order of nanoseconds at 300 k , in contrast to other boundaries . additionally , we find that the calculated formation / binding energies for substitutional he ( i.e. , he in a monovacancy ) correlates well with interstitial he , substitutional he@xmath2 , and interstitial he@xmath2 energies for the same atomic site , which asserts that the local environment surrounding each site strongly influences the he defect energies and that highly accurate quantum mechanics calculations of lower order defects may be an adequate predictor of higher order defects .",
    "the present work shows that the binding and formation energies for he defects is important for understanding the physics of he diffusion and trapping by grain boundaries , which can be important for modeling helium interactions in polycrystalline steels .",
    "the interaction between helium and iron grain boundaries was investigated by using ten different grain boundaries and multiple different he defect combinations for multiple sites within 15   of the boundary ( 52826 simulations total ) .",
    "table [ table1 ] lists the ten grain boundaries studied , their dimensions in terms of lattice units , the number of atoms and the interfacial energy .",
    "these grain boundaries represent the ten low coincident site lattice ( csl ) boundaries ( @xmath7 ) within the 100 and 110 symmetric tilt grain boundary ( stgb ) systems .",
    "this is a subset of those boundaries used in prior studies of point defect absorption ( vacancies and self - interstitial atoms ) by a large range of grain boundary structures in pure @xmath0-fe @xcite .",
    "these boundaries were generated using a previous methodology @xcite whereby multiple translations and an atom deletion criteria were used to locate minimum energy grain boundary structures .",
    "this method has been found to agree with experimentally - measured energies for @xmath3 asymmetric tilt grain boundaries in cu @xcite as well as experimental high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) images @xcite , including the orthorhombic 9r phase in fcc metals @xcite .",
    "while this methodology for generating grain boundaries was first applied to fcc metals , this method will also work for other bcc and hcp grain boundaries as it is based on generating a large number of energy - minimized grain boundary structures to find the minimum energy grain boundary for each grain boundary .",
    "the current set of boundaries includes four 100 stgbs ( @xmath6,@xmath8 ) and six 110 stgbs ( @xmath3,@xmath9,@xmath5 ) .",
    "recent experimental characterization of steels has shown that several of these symmetric tilt grain boundaries are observed at a concentration higher than random grain boundaries @xcite . for example , beladi and rollett quantified that the @xmath3112 symmetric tilt grain boundary is observed at @xmath1010 multiples of a random distribution ( mrd ) of grain boundaries @xcite , i.e. , much larger than would be expected . while the experimental observation of 100 symmetric tilt grain boundaries ( @xmath6 , @xmath8 gbs ) is below 1 mrd , these grain boundaries are commonly used in dft studies due to the low periodic distances required in the grain boundary plane .",
    "the present set of boundaries is smaller than those previously explored @xcite for two reasons .",
    "first , since we explored multiple starting configurations for the he defects in this study , a larger number of simulations were required for each grain boundary than for the point defect studies , which only considered a single vacancy or self - interstitial atom .",
    "second , our prior study @xcite found that , aside from a few boundaries ( e.g. , the @xmath3112 stgb , included herein ) , most grain boundaries had similar characteristics with respect to point defect interactions .",
    "these results suggest that the ten boundaries explored within can supply ample information about the interaction of he defects with low-@xmath1 grain boundaries , and perhaps shed insight on general high angle grain boundaries as well .    the simulation cell consisted of a 3d periodic bicrystalline structure with two periodic grain boundaries , similar to prior grain boundary studies @xcite .",
    "the two mirror - image grain boundaries are separated by a minimum distance of 12 nm to eliminate any effects on energies due to the presence of the second boundary . while the grain boundaries were generated using the minimum periodic length in the grain boundary period direction and the grain boundary tilt direction ( @xmath11- and @xmath12- directions , respectively ) , it was found that the formation energies for the defects were influenced for periodic lengths below 4@xmath13 .",
    "that is , the periodic image of the defect and/or its influence on the surrounding lattice can significantly affect the defect s formation energy .",
    "hence , multiple replications in the grain boundary tilt direction and the grain boundary period direction were used .",
    "for instance , the final dimensions for the @xmath6210 gb resulted in a vacancy formation energy far away from the boundary that was within 0.015% of that within a 2000-atom bcc single crystal ( i.e. , 10@xmath13 per side ) .",
    "this criteria resulted in simulation cell sizes on the order of 46609152 atoms ( @xmath14510 and @xmath15113 , respectively ) .",
    "all of the simulations were performed with a modified version of the moldy code @xcite .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the three different cases show different responses for interstitial he .",
    "first , in the bulk single crystal , the migration of interstitial he is relatively easy over the simulated time of 18 ps . in the grain boundary case , there are very different responses , though .",
    "interestingly , for the case of the interstitial he atom , the he is able to break away from the @xmath3112 boundary with a maximum migration energy of @xmath56 ev . since the long time simulation ran for a total time of 12.3 ns , the interstitial he broke away from the boundary in a time scale on the order of nanoseconds .",
    "the number of events within the first layer of the gb was also included in table [ table7 ] . there were 73 total events prior to the interstitial he breaking away from the gb region and 64 , or 87% , of those events occured within 1 layer of the gb plane .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ figureltd1 ] , on a number of cases , the interstitial he migrated outside of the 1@xmath57 gb layer and then re - entered the gb region . however , the low binding energy and small length scale of the @xmath3112 gb eventually allowed the interstitial he to break away over the time span of 12.3 ns . on the other hand , in the @xmath5332",
    "gb , the interstitial he predominantly migrates within the first couple of gb layers with a maximum migration energy of @xmath58 ev . the long time dynamics simulations were simulated for 1.8 @xmath59s and only 4 times was the interstitial he able to migrate beyond the first layer . in each of those times ,",
    "the interstitial he migated back towards the gb plane and was effectively trapped at the boundary .",
    "interestingly , since the interstitial he atom can not escape over the time span simulated in the present work , the net migration of interstitial he in the @xmath5332 gb is in the 113 gb plane direction and not in the 110 tilt direction ( effectively , one - dimensional on the scale of @xmath59s ) .",
    "these long time dynamic simulations validate that the anomalous behavior of the @xmath3112 boundary with respect to the molecular statics simulations ( formation and binding energies ) is associated with different dynamic behavior and sink efficiency as well , at least for the case of interstitial he .",
    "however , these simulations also show that calculating the migration energies is also important for understanding the interaction between he defects and grain boundaries .",
    "interestingly , since the @xmath5332 has binding properties closest to the @xmath3112 ( see table [ table5 ] ) , this implies that interstitial he placed at the gb for all other boundaries studied within would be similarly trapped by the grain boundary .    the results produced using the present gao et al .",
    "@xcite potential and the long time dynamics technique produce results that differ from earlier studies @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the present work , an interstitial he atom was able to break away from the @xmath3112 boundary at 300 k , migrating three - dimensionally as in the bulk lattice upon breaking away from the boundary .",
    "this is in contrast to earlier work that found that interstitial he primarily migrated one - dimensionally along the 111 direction within the @xmath3112 gb at lower temperatures ( 600 k ) and change to two - dimensional and three - dimensional migration at higher temperatures ( 800 k and 1000 k , respectively ) . on the other hand ,",
    "though , the @xmath5332 gb produced a zigzag behavior that predominantly lied within the grain boundary plane along the 113 direction , similar to that observed by gao et al .",
    "this change in behavior for the @xmath3112 boundary may be attributed to the smaller migration energies for the current potential , which more accurately captures the energetics of he atoms within the fe lattice @xcite .",
    "this result is important as the @xmath3112 gb is the coherent twin in @xmath0-fe and has been experimentally observed at populations over 10 mrd in steels @xcite .",
    "moreover , this result shows the crucial role that the interatomic potential can have on nanoscale mechanisms and results .",
    "the long time dynamics simulations show that the binding and formation energies for he defects can be important for understanding the physics of he diffusion and trapping by grain boundaries , which can be important for modeling the nucleation and growth of helium bubbles at grain boundaries .",
    "the fact that the @xmath3112 grain boundary exhibits a low binding energy with he defects and our simulations indicate that interstitial he can break away from this boundary may have ramifications for grain boundary engineering of polycrystals , especially considering that this boundary is associated with twins within the microstructure .",
    "the ability of process materials to increase the density of twins without appreciably affecting he trapping at these twin boundaries may be required for the extreme environment of future reactors .",
    "the formation / binding energetics and interaction length scales associated with the interaction between he atoms and grain boundaries in bcc @xmath0-fe was explored .",

    "<S> the formation / binding energetics and length scales associated with the interaction between he atoms and grain boundaries in bcc @xmath0-fe was explored . </S>",
    "<S> ten different low @xmath1 grain boundaries from the 100 and 110 symmetric tilt grain boundary systems were used . in this work , we then calculated formation / binding energies for 12 he atoms in the substitutional and interstitial sites ( hev , he@xmath2v , heint , he@xmath2int ) at all potential grain boundary sites within 15   of the boundary ( 52826 simulations total ) . </S>",

    "<S> for instance , the @xmath3112 twin boundary in bcc fe possesses a much smaller binding energy than other boundaries , which corresponds in long time dynamics simulations to the ability of an interstitial he defect to break away from the boundary in simulations on the order of nanoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , positive correlations between the calculated formation / binding energies of the he defects ( @xmath4 0.9 ) asserts that the local environment surrounding each site strongly influences the he defect energies and that highly accurate quantum mechanics calculations of lower order defects may be an adequate predictor of higher order defects . </S>",
    "<S> various metrics to quantify or classify the local environment were compared with the he defect binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> the present work shows that the binding and formation energies for he defects are important for understanding the physics of he diffusion and trapping by grain boundaries , which can be important for modeling he interactions in polycrystalline steels . </S>",
