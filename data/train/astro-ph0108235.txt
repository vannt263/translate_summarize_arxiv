    "pulsar emission process is still poorly understood even more than 30 yr after the discovery . nevertheless , it is the consensus of the researchers ( e.g. , usov 2000 ) that primary pairs are produced and accelerated in regions ( gaps ) with strong electric field along magnetic line ( @xmath1 ) and more secondary pairs ( with multiplicity @xmath2 ) are created outside the gaps ( @xmath3 ) , and that instability may be developed in the secondary @xmath4 relativistic plasma in order to give out coherent radio emission .",
    "numerous models have been made concerning gap acceleration , whereas it is urgent to find effective way to test those specific and detailed models against observations .",
    "because of observational difficulties , only braking indices @xmath5 ( @xmath6 the angular velocity of rotation ) of 5 young radio pulsars have been obtained observationally ( lyne & graham - smith 1998 and references therein , camilo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "they are : psr b0531 + 21 ( @xmath7 ) , psr b1509 - 58 ( @xmath8 ) , psr b0540 - 69 ( @xmath9 ) , psr b0833 - 45 ( @xmath10 ) , psr j1119 - 6127 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "certainly , these observed indices include precious information on how pulsars produce radiation .",
    "but all of them are remarkably smaller than the value @xmath12 expected for the pure magnetodipole radiation , according to which , the polar magnetic field strength at pulsar surface , @xmath13 , is conventionally determined by ( e.g. , manchester & taylor 1977 ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the rotation period , @xmath16 the moment of inertia , @xmath17 the speed of light , @xmath18 the pulsar radius , @xmath19 the inclination angle .",
    "@xmath13 is singular ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) when @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath13-field derivation in this way is questionable and inconsistent since observation indicates @xmath22 , which means other processes do contribute to the braking torque .",
    "indeed some efforts have appeared to find unusual torque mechanisms to understand the observed braking index ( see , e.g. , menou , perna & hernquist 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "an alternative effort , within the framework of `` _ standard _ '' neutron stars and their magnetospheric emission models , is proposed in this _",
    "letter_. we find that @xmath23 and @xmath13 derivation should generally depend on pulsar emission models .",
    "assuming that the orthogonal and aligned parts of magnetic moment are responsible to the dipole - radiation torque and to the unipolar - generator one , respectively , we obtain consistent equations for calculating braking index and magnetic field in the inner vacuum - gap , the space - charge - limited flow , and the outer gap models .",
    "we find that all of these models result in braking index @xmath22 , and in return the models could be tested for a particular pulsar if its braking index and the inclination angle are observed .",
    "pulsar broad - band emission depends essentially on a complete solution of the formidable well - defined magnetosphere problem in relativistic electrodynamics and plasma physics , which , unfortunately , is still unknown hitherto ( e.g. , mestel 2000 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the problem has been understood to some extent in two particular , i.e. , the orthogonal and aligned rotating , cases .",
    "* orthogonal rotator *  an orthogonal rotator with magnetic dipolar momentum @xmath24 emits monochromatic electromagnetic waves , the energy loss rate of which is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "these low frequency waves are generally unable to propagate and should be absorbed in neutron star surroundings , and a larger amount of energy and the corresponding momentum could be pumped from neutron stars into their supernova remnants ( pacini 1967 ) . *",
    "aligned rotator *  the maximum potential drop in the open - field - line region by unipolar effect is ( e.g. , ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) @xmath29 @xmath4 pairs ( or ions ) are accelerated in charge depletion gaps , picking up energy in the gaps and angular momentum from the magnetic torque when streaming out . the angular momentum loss requirement ( holloway 1977 ) can be satisfied if the charged particles can be `` attached '' to the magnetic field as far as near or out to the light cylinder .",
    "two kinds of gaps are proposed to work in pulsar magnetospheres , which are called as inner and outer gaps .",
    "various inner gaps are suggested , which depend on the binding energy of charged particles in pulsar surface , e.g. , the vacuum gap model ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) with enough binding , the space - charge - limited flow model without any binding ( arons & scharlemenn 1979 , harding & muslimov 1998 ) .",
    "the outer gap model was suggested to work near the null surface ( e.g. , cheng , ho & ruderman 1986 , zhang & cheng 1997 ) because the charged particles on each side of the surface should flow in opposite direction in order to close a global current in pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "it is thus obvious , as seen from above , that the energy loss is model - dependent for aligned rotators , which will be considered when calculating pulsar braking indices and magnetic fields in the next section .",
    "nevertheless , the energy loss rate of an aligned rotator , due to unipolar effect , could be written in the form of @xmath30 , if a gap has potential drop @xmath31 and the charge density in the gap is @xmath32 cgse @xmath33 , where the polar cap radius @xmath34 cm .",
    "@xmath35 since @xmath36 and @xmath37 are conventionally expected to be in a same order .    *",
    "the assumption *  there are two schools of thought on the energy loss of an oblique magnetized rotator .",
    "one group opined that the magnetodipole radiation is the dominate mechanism of braking ( e.g. , manchester & taylor 1977 , dai & lu 1998 , lyubarsky & kirk 2001 ) , where no braking appears when @xmath38 .",
    "another group suggested that pulsars spindown dominates by a longitudinal current outflow due to unipolar generator ( e.g. , beskin et al .",
    "1984 ) , where @xmath39 constant if @xmath40 . however , although there are two unseemly points when @xmath38 for the first school and when @xmath41 for the second one , an interesting and strange thing , which is understandable in the next section , is that the derived physical parameters ( e.g. , b - field strength ) are reasonable .",
    "we proposed that both energy loss mechanisms above , i.e. , via dipole radiation and via unipolar generator , are expected to contribute the total braking torque of an oblique pulsar .",
    "phenomenologically , for a pulsar with a total magnetic momentum @xmath42 ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , we could write the total energy loss in the form of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are generally two functions of @xmath19 indicating the contributions of those two energy loss mechanisms , respectively . certainly @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "an essential and simple assumption to be employed in this paper is @xmath50 , since @xmath51 if @xmath24 and @xmath52 result _ independently _ in spindowns of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "therefore we have @xmath55 with @xmath56",
    "the energy carried away by the dipole radiation ( @xmath57 ) and the relativistic particles ( @xmath54 ) originates from the rotation kinetic energy , the loss rate of which is @xmath58 .",
    "energy conservation conduces towards @xmath59 based on eq.([doto ] ) , the braking index can be derived to be @xmath60 which is not exactly 3 as long as @xmath61 is not a constant . if @xmath62 , then @xmath22 for @xmath63 ( @xmath64 for @xmath65 ) . for pulsars near death line , @xmath66 ,",
    "i.e. , the maximum potential drop @xmath67 available acts on gap . in this case ,",
    "@xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath22 if @xmath19 gets smaller as pulsar evolves . for pulsars being away from death line , the potential drop @xmath31 across an accelerator gap , which is model - dependent , is much smaller than @xmath67 .",
    "we discuss baking index in the following models , assuming that @xmath70 ( @xmath71 and @xmath19 ) and @xmath16 are not changed for simplicity , since both observation ( bhattacharya et al .",
    "1992 ) and theory ( e.g. , xu & busse 2001 ) imply that a pulsar s @xmath13-field does not decay significantly during the rotation - powered phase .",
    "* the vacuum gap ( vg ) model *   the basic picture of vacuum gap formed above polar cap with enough binding energy was delineated explicitly in ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) , where relativistic primary electrons emit @xmath72-rays via curvature radiation in the gap . the gap potential difference @xmath73 , where the curvature radius .",
    "but in this paper we simply use dipole field lines for indication . ]",
    "@xmath74 cm .",
    "@xmath75 for polar cap accelerators . we thus have @xmath76 for vacuum gap where primary electrons emit @xmath72-rays via resonant inverse compton scattering off the thermal photons ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2000 ) , the potential drop and the @xmath61 value are @xmath77 * the space - charge - limited flow ( sclf ) model *   sclf model works for pulsars with boundary condition of @xmath3 at the pulsar surfaces .",
    "the previous sclf ( arons & scharlemann 1979 ) model has been improved to a new version ( e.g. , harding & muslimov 1998 ) with the inclusion of the frame - dragging effect . though a simple and general analytical formula for all pulsar is not available in the harding - muslimov ( 1998 ) model , the potential drop could be well approximated in the extreme cases , regime i and ii , which are defined as cases without or with field saturation . in regime",
    "ii case ( i.e. , the gap height being larger than @xmath78 ) , zhang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) obtained the potential drop , according to which @xmath61 values can be calculated .",
    "@xmath79for the cr - induced sclf models ; @xmath80for the resonant ics - induced sclf models . in regime",
    "i , the stable acceleration scenario should be controlled by curvature radiation ( zhang & harding 2000 ) , @xmath81 * the outer gap ( og ) model *   for a self - sustaining outer gap , which is limited by the @xmath4 pair produced by collisions between high - energy photons from the gap and soft x - rays resulting from the surface heating by the backflowing primary @xmath4 pairs , the potential drop is @xmath82 , where the fractional size of such outer gap @xmath83 ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) .",
    "@xmath84 , which is satisfied for the five pulsars , if outer gap works .",
    "the @xmath61 value therefore can be calculated , @xmath85 from these @xmath61 values in different models , the braking index can be obtained by eq.([n ] ) . for typical pulsars with @xmath86 and @xmath87 ,",
    "we compute the braking index @xmath23 in each model , which is shown in fig.[f.n ] .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath22 as long as inclination angle @xmath88 in all of the models .",
    "pulsars with small rotation periods tend to have @xmath89 .",
    "also we can see from fig.[f.n ] or eq.([doto ] ) that there is a minimum braking index @xmath90 for each model . in case of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "we can not solve out magnetic field @xmath13 by only eq.([doto ] ) because @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath41 ( or @xmath99 ) , the solution of eq.([doto ] ) results in eq.([b0 ] ) . in principal , eq.([doto ] ) and ( [ n ] ) should be combined to find consistent @xmath13 and @xmath19 in case of braking index being known .",
    "however , because @xmath100 , the magnetic field derived from eq.([b0 ] ) is good enough but only modified by a factor @xmath101 .    based on eq.([doto ] ) and ( [ n ] ) , the inclination angles of the five pulsars with observed braking indices are calculated in different models ( see table [ t.a ] ) .",
    "no solution of @xmath19 is available for the vela pulsar ( psr b0833 - 45 ) and psr b0540 - 69 for the regime ii sclf(ics ) model since their braking indices are smaller than @xmath102 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that these pulsars are young , and their gap heights are thus much smaller than @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , we can determine whether a model works on a particular pulsar by comparing the calculated @xmath19 in table [ t.a ] with the observed @xmath19 .",
    "usually @xmath19 can be derived by fitting the position angle curves of pulsars with high linear polarization in the rotating vector model ( lyne & manchester 1988 ) .",
    "for the five pulsars , only the inclination angle of the vela pulsar is obtained ( @xmath104 ) , however no @xmath19 value in table [ t.a ] tallies with this observation",
    ". there may be two possibilities to explain the discrepancy .",
    "the braking torques due to the dipole radiation and to the unipolar generator should be treated and added in an other manner ( e.g. , harding et al .",
    "1999 ) , rather than the way of ours .",
    "however , our treatment about the torques is reasonable , a further improvement of braking calculation might not change substantially the results presented .",
    "no model listed in table [ t.a ] can perfectly describe the actual accelerate situation of the vela pulsar .",
    "the outer gap model explain well the high - energy emission of this pulsar , but could be still a partial description of the global magnetosphere .",
    "one possible picture is that both inner and outer gaps coexist in a pulsar s magnetosphere ( usov 2000 ) , but the _ interaction _ between these two gaps and the pair plasma properties are still very uncertain .",
    "it is also possible that pair production process in strong magnetic and electric fields should be improved .",
    "for example , if @xmath105 ( @xmath106 g ) , @xmath72-photons nearly along curved field lines convert into positroniums which could partially prevent the screening of @xmath1 ( resultantly increasing the gap height and possibly having @xmath107 ) , and therefore the energy loss @xmath54 increases significantly in polar cap models ( usov & melrose 1996 ) .",
    "such an increase could result in a larger @xmath19 in table [ t.a ] ( see eq.([n ] ) ) since all magnetic fields of the five pulsar are very strong ( near or greater than @xmath108 ) . in conclusion ,",
    "further studies of testing emission models via braking index and of the theoretical meaning of the test result would be interesting and necessary .",
    "we have proposed in this _ letter _ that the observed braking index @xmath22 could be understood if the braking torques due to the dipole radiation and to the unipolar generator are combined .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed inclination angle and that derived from the six models of the vela pulsar in table [ t.a ] may call for improved pulsar emission models .",
    "in addition it is found that the magnetic field strength of a pulsar by conventional method could be a pretty good representation of the actual one .",
    "fig.[f.n ] shows the variations of braking index @xmath23 as functions of pulsar periods .",
    "since pulsars spin down in their life , the curves in fig.[f.n ] represent the variations of @xmath23 as functions of pulsar ages to some extent .",
    "@xmath23 decreases as a pulsar evolves .",
    "however , the johnston - galloway s ( 1999 ) method to derive braking index can only be applied if @xmath23 is constant during pulsar life .",
    "therefore @xmath23 can not been obtained by only @xmath109 and @xmath110 in principle .",
