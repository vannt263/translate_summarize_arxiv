    "the representation of interactions in a human society as a complex network , where nodes and links play the respective roles of individuals and their contacts , has been useful for modeling , studying , and understanding many problems in epidemiology @xcite .",
    "usually it is assumed that diseases evolve faster than the topological evolution of the underlying network , so that the links of the network can be regarded as static . with modern mass media ,",
    "however , the presence of an epidemic can be broadcast much faster than disease propagation .",
    "this information will inevitably change the behavior of the individuals comprising this network as , for example , they try to avoid contacts with infected people . in this way",

    "we examine here the effectiveness of a quarantinestrategy , where healthy people are advisedto avoid contacts with individuals that carry the disease . that is , a healthy person has a chance to suppress a contact with an infected neighbor and form a new tie with another healthy peer ( rewiring ) .",
    "the value of this rewiring probability could depend , for instance , on the concern that the society has about the disease and , as suggested above , in a globalized world this concern will depend on the broadcast news .",
    "the degree of media attention about the disease is a parameter that could be controlled by public health services . indeed",
    ", it is known that spontaneous quarantine in the recent h1n1 pandemic was found to have a large impact in reducing the final size of the epidemic @xcite .",
    "based on these observations , we propose two strategies for the propagation of epidemics on an adaptive network , in which individuals alter their local neighborhoods with constant quarantine probability @xmath0 as described above , and systematically study the effect that the quarantine has on epidemic spreading .",
    "we find a phase transition at a critical threshold @xmath1 above which the epidemic is stopped from spreading .",
    "we show also how the epidemic spreading in the presence of quarantine depends on the contagion and recovery parameters .",
    "more importantly , we find that the initial structure of the network plays an essential role in disease propagation at criticality , unlike in previous related models @xcite where results only depend on the average network connectivity .",
    "we also introduce a generalized form of quarantine , where the probability of rewiring is proportional to the degree of the infected nodes , producing a more efficient isolation of the nodes with high degree .",
    "this preferential rewiring is more efficient than the case with @xmath0 constant .",
    "we consider the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) epidemic spreading model , which is well established and accurately describes diseases such as seasonal influenza , sars , or aids @xcite .",
    "initially , all nodes are in the susceptible state ( @xmath4 ) , with one node chosen at random ( seed ) in the infected state ( @xmath5 ) . in the first strategy , strategy @xmath6 , at each time unit , every infected node @xmath5 in the network tries to transmit the disease to each susceptible neighbor @xmath4 with infection probability @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath4 does not get infected , then with rewiring probability @xmath0 it disconnects its link from @xmath5 and reconnects it to another randomly chosen susceptible node , different from its present neighbors .",

    "the transition from the disease - free phase to the epidemic phase corresponds to the average number of secondary infections per infected node becoming larger than one , allowing the long - term survival of the disease and thus ensuring the epidemic spreads to a large fraction of the population . in our problem ,",

    "we have introduced and studied two strategies for the propagation of epidemics on evolving networks of social contacts .",

    "we demonstrated by an analytical approach , and confirmed by numerical simulations , that the size of the epidemics can be largely reduced by increasing the probability of rewiring , and that the propagation can be eventually stopped by using high enough values of @xmath0 . in other words , quarantine is an effective way to halt the appearance of epidemics that would otherwise emerge in the case of a static network . for strategy a ,",
    "when the infection probabliy is larger than a threshold the quarantine mechanism is not effective any more and disease propagation becomes unavoidable .",
    "this is because the quarantine model only breaks contact after allowing for a chance of infection , thus for high enough infection probability , the spreading is irreversible , even with a rewiring probability of unity . for strategy",
    "b , the quarantine mechanism is effective in homogeneous networks and finite heterogeneous networks , even for infection probability equal to unity .",
    "the transition disappears only for large , very heterogeneous networks . in these scale - free networks ,",
    "the critical rewiring probability becomes very large and the transition eventually disappears for large enough systems , thus only the epidemic phase is observed .",
    "this is likely due to the presence of individuals with very large connectivity that can spread the disease over a large fraction of the population , even for small infection probabilities .",
    "to confirm this , we introduced a generalized form of strategy b , where the quarantine depends on the degree of the infected nodes .",
    "this preferential rewiring isolates the superspreaders more efficiently , reducing @xmath1 and preserving a finite transition even for a scale - free networks .",
    "lastly , in sir dynamics the final frozen state , where everybody is either recovered or susceptible , is reached rather quickly in a time of order @xmath118 according to our simulations and thus an sir network does not evolve much , so the initial topology is preserved during the entire evolution of the system . in contrast , in adaptive models with sis or sirs dynamics the system evolves for a very long time in the epidemic phase times that grow exponentially larger with @xmath33 thus the network moves towards a stationary topology similar to an erds - rnyi network , independent of the initial topology , and rendering the initial topology irrelevant .",
    "therefore , unlike other adaptive network models of epidemic spreading , in our model the epidemic threshold has a strong correlation with the topology of the network , which remains relatively unchanged at criticality , and the social structure of connections when epidemics begin to propagate is crucial in the state of the final outbreak .",
