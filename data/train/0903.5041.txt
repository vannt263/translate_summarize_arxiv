    "phenomenological theories of incompressible mhd turbulence that take into account the anisotropy of the fluctuations with respect to the direction of the mean magnetic field @xmath12 were pioneered by goldreich & sridhar and others in the 1990s .",
    "the influencial and somewhat controversial theory of goldreich & sridhar @xcite established the idea that the timescale or coherence time for motions of a turbulent eddy parallel and perpendicular to @xmath12 must be equal to each other and this unique timescale then defines the energy cascade time .",
    "this concept , called _ critical balance _ , leads immediately to the perpendicular energy spectrum @xmath13 and to the scaling relation @xmath14 describing the anisotropy of the turbulent eddies .",
    "the decade following the publication of the paper by goldreich & sridhar in 1995 was a time when significant advances in computing power were brought to bear on computational studies of mhd turbulence .",
    "simulations of incompressible mhd turbulence during this time showed that when the mean magnetic field is strong , @xmath15 , the perpendicular energy spectrum exhibits a power - law scaling closer to @xmath16 than @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "motivated by this result , boldyrev modified the goldreich & sridhar theory to explain the @xmath16 power - law seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "a new concept that emerged in boldyrev s theory is the scale dependent alignment of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations whereby the angle @xmath18 formed by @xmath2 and @xmath3 scales like @xmath19 in the inertial range .",
    "this alignment effect weakens the nonlinear interactions and yields the perpendicular energy spectrum @xmath20 .",
    "evidence for this alignment effect has been found in numerical simulations of incompressible mhd turbulence @xcite and in studies of solar wind data @xcite .    the phenomenological theory of @xcite",
    "can also be used to explain the observed @xmath16 energy spectrum . using a slightly modified critical balance relation that retains the @xmath14 scaling of the goldreich & sridhar theory ,",
    "their model admits the @xmath16 energy spectrum ( as well as other solutions ) .",
    "however , the theory of @xcite does not include the scale dependent alignment that arises in boldyrev s theory and , more importantly , is seen in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "the theories discussed so far @xcite all assume that the cross - helicity vanishes and , therefore , these theories can not be applied to solar wind turbulence . when the cross - helicity of the turbulence is nonzero it is necessary to take into account the cascades of both energy and cross - helicity .",
    "a generalization of the goldreich & sridhar theory to turbulence with nonvanishing cross - helicity , also called imbalanced turbulence , has been developed by lithwick , goldreich , & sridhar @xcite .",
    "other theories of imbalanced turbulence have been derived by beresnyak & lazarian @xcite and chandran @xcite . however",
    ", none of these theories contains the scale dependent alignment of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations seen in the solar wind .",
    "therefore , to develop a theory that may be applicable to solar wind turbulence it is of interest to generalize boldyrev s theory to incompressible mhd turbulence with non - vanishing cross - helicity .",
    "an extension of boldyrev s theory to imbalanced turbulence has been discussed by perez & boldyrev @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop a theoretical framework which generalizes the results of perez & boldyrev and is consistent with solar wind observations .",
    "our theory is founded , in part , on two new solar wind observations presented in this paper .",
    "the first is the observation that the normalized cross - helicity @xmath4 , the ratio of cross - helicity to energy , is _ scale invariant _ in the inertial range . the second is the observation that the probabilities @xmath0 and @xmath1 that fluctuations are positively or negatively aligned , respectively , are also _ scale invariant _ , that is , these quantities are approximately constant in the inertial range .",
    "experimental evidence for the scale invariance of @xmath4 comes from solar wind observations by @xcite and also figure  1 below , and from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "evidence for the scale invariance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is shown in figure  2 below . assuming these quantities are all scale invariant we deduce expressions for the energy cascade rates and the rms fluctuations that generalize the results in @xcite and @xcite and are consistent with the concept of scale dependent alignment of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations , a concept neglected in other phenomenological theories @xcite .",
    "the resulting theory , which is founded on the concept of scale - invariance and grounded in solar wind observations , contains the theories of @xcite and @xcite as special cases , but opens up a broader range of physical possibilities .",
    "consistent with numerical simulations and solar wind observations , in our approach the fluctuations at a given point may assume one of two possible states referred to as _ positively aligned _ @xmath21 and _ negatively aligned _ @xmath22 .",
    "each state is characterized by its own rms energy @xmath23 , alignment angle @xmath18 , and nonlinear timescale @xmath24 .",
    "positively aligned fluctuations have a characteristic spatial gradient which determines their nonlinear timescale and negatively aligned fluctuations have a different spatial gradient which determines their nonlinear timescale .",
    "these timescales are estimated from the nonlinear terms in the mhd equations as described in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "section 2 describes the geometries of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations that are either aligned ` @xmath25 ' or anti - aligned ` @xmath26 ' and these are used to form estimates of the nonlinear terms in the mhd equations . from this foundation ,",
    "estimates of the energy cascade times are constructed in section 3 and the theory of the energy cascade process is developed in section 4 .",
    "the summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "consider velocity and magnetic field fluctuations measured between two points separated by a distance @xmath27 in the field perpendicular plane .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the fluctuations in the plane perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are both measured in velocity units .",
    "suppose that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are aligned with some small angle @xmath30 and assume , as for alfvn waves , that @xmath31 .",

    "suppose that the gradient of the fluctuations is in the direction perpendicular to @xmath28 . in this case , @xmath41 and @xmath42 the time rate of change caused by nonlinear interactions",

    "if @xmath28 and @xmath45 are aligned with some small angle @xmath18 , then the fluctuations are called `` negatively aligned '' or `` anti - aligned '' and denoted by ` @xmath26 ' ( figure 1b ) . for positively aligned fluctuations , equations ( [ nl_term1])([nl_terms2 ] ) imply @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the angle formed by @xmath28 and @xmath29 and quantities with the subscript @xmath25 describe positively aligned fluctuations .",
    "it is clear from the middle term in equation ( [ w+up ] ) that the time rate of change of @xmath49 depends on @xmath50 , consistent with the nonlinear terms in the mhd equations , although this dependence is not immediately apparent in the last term in ( [ w+up ] ) . for negatively aligned fluctuations , equations ( [ nl_term1])([nl_terms2 ] )",

    "in general , the fluctuations @xmath28 and @xmath29 observed at any point @xmath56 are either positively or negatively aligned . for a point @xmath56 picked at random ,",

    "alternatively , note that @xmath80 as discussed below , solar wind observations show that this quantity is approximately constant in the inertial range .",
    "now , as @xmath77 and @xmath78 the only way that this can remain constant is if @xmath81 is bounded away from zero and @xmath82 this justifies the approximation in eqn ( [ partition ] )",
    ".    equation ( [ partition ] ) shows that at a given scale @xmath27 the total energy @xmath83/4 $ ] is partitioned into two parts , the energy @xmath84 associated with positive alignment and the energy @xmath85 associated with negative alignment .",
    "the normalized cross - helicity @xmath4 is defined as the ratio of the cross - helicity to the energy at a given scale and can be written @xmath86 for small angles , equations ( [ nl1 ] ) and ( [ nl2 ] ) become , to leading order , @xmath87 to express these in terms of the rms values @xmath60 , eliminate @xmath88 and @xmath89 using equation ( [ partition ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath90 these estimates shall be used to derive the cascade times .",
    "when nonlinear interactions are strong and a large number of fourier modes are excited , fluctuations occur continuously in time and space . during a time @xmath24 the fractional change in the quantity @xmath91 is , from ( [ nl1c ] ) , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the cascade time at the lengthscale @xmath27 and",

    "hereafter , the tildes will be omitted and @xmath98 and @xmath99 will always represent the rms values .    according to the definition of the energy cascade time , the fractional change @xmath100 is of order unity when the interaction time @xmath24 is equal to the cascade time @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , the relations ( [ chi+ ] ) and ( [ chi- ] ) imply @xmath101 by similar reasoning , equations ( [ w+up ] ) and ( [ w - down ] ) imply @xmath102 moreover , equations ( [ t_cas ] ) , ( [ t_up_down ] ) , and ( [ partition ] ) imply @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the energy cascade times for the rms elsasser amplitudes are equal to the energy cascade times for the positively and negatively aligned fluctuations .    for balanced turbulence , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath10 , @xmath107 , and the energy cascade times ( [ t_cas ] ) reduce to the cascade time in boldyrev s original theory @xcite",

    ", it follows from the preceding analysis that the timescales for the rms amplitudes take the form ( [ t_cas ] ) .",
    "as pointed out by kraichnan @xcite , dobrowolny , mangeney , and veltri @xcite , and others , the energy cascade in mhd turbulence occurs through collisions between alfvn wavepackets propagating in opposite directions along the mean magnetic field . in other words",
    ", it is the interaction between @xmath98 and @xmath99 waves that causes the energy to cascade to smaller scales in mhd turbulence .",
    "consequently , the cascade time for @xmath98 , say , should depend on @xmath99 . while it may appear from equations ( [ t_cas])([t_up_down ] ) that the timescale for @xmath98 fluctuations depends only on @xmath98 and , therefore , the interaction with the @xmath99 waves is absent , this is not true .",
    "the interactions are still present in the expressions ( [ t_cas ] ) and ( [ t_up_down ] ) through the dependence on the angles and other parameters as will be shown in the next section .",
    "assuming there is no direct injection of energy or cross - helicity within the inertial range and there is no dissipation of energy or cross - helicity within the inertial range , the energy cascade rate @xmath109 and the cross - helicity cascade rate @xmath110 are scale - invariant in the inertial range .",

    "<S> a phenomenological anisotropic theory of mhd turbulence with nonvanishing cross - helicity is constructed based on boldyrev s phenomenology and probabilities @xmath0 and @xmath1 for fluctuations @xmath2 and @xmath3 to be positively or negatively aligned . </S>",
    "<S> the positively aligned fluctuations occupy a fractional volume @xmath0 and the negatively aligned fluctuations occupy a fractional volume @xmath1 . guided by observations suggesting that the normalized cross - helicity @xmath4 and the probabilities @xmath0 and @xmath1 are approximately scale invariant in the inertial range , a generalization of boldyrev s theory is derived that depends on the three ratios @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that the cascade process for positively and negatively aligned fluctuations are both in a state of critical balance and that the eddy geometries are scale invariant . </S>",
    "<S> the theory reduces to boldyrev s original theory when @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 and extends the theory of perez and boldyrev when @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is also an anisotropic generalization of the theory of dobrowolny , mangeney , and veltri . </S>"
