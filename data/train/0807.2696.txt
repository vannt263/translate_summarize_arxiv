    "the recent revival of the effective action in strong electromagnetic fields is partly due to a direct test of the strong qed in terrestrial experiments in the near future @xcite and partly due to applications to astrophysical objects with strong electromagnetic fields beyond the critical strength .",
    "in contrast to constant electromagnetic fields , finding the effective action in inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields is a non - trivial task .",
    "there have been recent attempts to find the pair - production rate in inhomogeneous electric fields , in particular , in localized electric fields either in space or time @xcite .",
    "a key idea is the electric - magnetic duality of the qed effective action @xcite , according to which the effective action for a constant magnetic field can be analytically continued to that for a constant electric field .",
    "though a landau level in a constant magnetic field is dual to the tunneling motion in a constant electric field @xcite , in the real spacetime a particle accelerates by an electric field , whose unbounded motion makes non - trivial the task of finding the effective action from the time - dependent state . dunne and hall used the resolvent technique and directly found the effective action in time - dependent electric fields @xcite and fried and woodard found the effective action for electric fields that depend on the light - cone time coordinate @xcite .",

    "the ingoing vacuum evolves to the outgoing vacuum via the evolution operator .",
    "the evolution operator is given by a phase part and a squeeze operator , whose parameters are determined by bogoliubov coefficients .",
    "the effective action is then defined through the scattering amplitude between the ingoing and the outgoing vacua @xcite .",
    "the renormalized effective action for a constant electric field , given by a bogoliubov coefficient for each momentum , correctly yields not only the vacuum polarization but also the vacuum persistence @xcite .",

    ", the electric field provides a potential barrier , over which the charged particle scatters from an ingoing state to an outgoing one . to find the effective action in electric fields is not straightforward because unbounded motions cause instability of the vacuum . in this section",
