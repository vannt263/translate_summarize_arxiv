    "non - leptonic weak decays are valuable tools for testing the standard model ( sm ) , the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) mechanism , and the unitarity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , and for exploring physics beyond the sm . among non - leptonic decays ,",
    "the decay of the light pseudoscalar meson @xmath9 is interesting because it is fundamental to understand the long - standing problem of the @xmath10 rule in weak non - leptonic interactions .",
    "the experimental @xmath10 rule was first established in the decay @xmath11 .",
    "a neutral kaon may decay into two pions with amplitudes @xmath12 or @xmath13 , respectively . as the real parts of these amplitudes , re@xmath12 is dominated by @xmath10 transitions and",
    "re@xmath13 receives contributions from @xmath14 transitions , the former transitions dominate re@xmath12 , which expresses the so - called @xmath10 rule  @xcite @xmath15 despite nearly 50 years of efforts , the microscopic dynamical mechanism responsible for such a striking phenomenon is still elusive .",
    "the decay @xmath9 receives contributions from both the @xmath10 and @xmath14 parts of the weak hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to see whether the @xmath10 rule is functional in this type of decay , and this could shed light on the origin of this rule .",
    "the branching fraction of @xmath16 decay is predicted to be of the order of @xmath17 or higher  @xcite , with a large long - range hadronic contribution expected , which should become observable in high luminosity electron - positron collisions .    at present",

    "the world s largest sample of @xmath19 @xmath4 events produced at rest and collected with the besdetector therefore offers a good opportunity to search for this rare decay . in this paper , the measurement of the ratio @xmath20 is presented , where the @xmath0 is produced in the decay @xmath21 .",
    "the advantage of comparing these two @xmath0 decay channels is that parts of the systematic uncertainties due to the tracking , the particle identification ( pid ) , the branching fractions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the number of @xmath24 events cancel in the ratio .",
