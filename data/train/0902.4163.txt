    "optical microscopy and light scattering are widely used , well - known techniques , often applied to the study of samples such as biomedical systems , colloidal suspensions , or complex fluids .",
    "traditionally , the instruments for implementing optical microscopy and light scattering belong to two well distinct groups .",
    "optical microscopes are imaging tools , that is , they provide a deterministic mapping of an object s optical properties , collecting light in the so - called near field .",
    "conversely light scattering devices measure statistical properties , detecting the light scattered in the far field @xcite .",
    "accordingly , traditional light scattering methods can be conveniently renamed as scattering in the far field ( siff ) techniques .",
    "a whole family of alternative methods have been developed for measuring the scattered light intensity fluctuations in the near field , similarly to what is done in microscopy .",
    "several different names have been introduced to describe these specific slightly different methods , often independently developed by different communities . here",
    "we will call this family : scattering in the near field ( sinf ) @xcite , as opposed to siff .",
    "the community interested in laser speckles developed the near field speckle ( or scattering ) ( nfs ) techniques , first in the homodyne version @xcite and then in heterodyne version , heterodyne near field speckles ( hnfs ) @xcite .",
    "similar techniques , but applied to imaging configurations are shadowgraph @xcite and schlieren @xcite . in turn , these bear a strong similarity with gabor s in - line holography @xcite . furthermore , the community devoted to holography have also used a similar approach for back scattering detection @xcite . finally , microscopists reported fourier transform light scattering @xcite and differential dynamic microscopy @xcite . however , an exaustive list of sinf techniques is out of the scope of a paper .",
    "some years ago , the interest in the development of a hybrid instrument , combining optical microscopy and light scattering , led to the development of optical systems able to record simultaneously the near and the far field light intensities @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the extreme complexity of the experimental set - ups limited the spread of these techniques .",
    "sinf techniques proved to be a very simple and efficient way to use a microscope in order to measure static light scattering @xcite or dynamic light scattering of nanoparticles @xcite , depolarized dynamic light scattering of rod - like nanoparticles @xcite and biological samples @xcite .",
    "generally the dynamics is extracted by means of a so - called `` differential '' algorithm presented in references @xcite , which has also been used with white light @xcite and x - rays illumination @xcite ; moreover it has been used for exctracting static data @xcite .",
    "since the algorithm involves fast grabbing of the images , a further simplifying step is constituted by the `` exposure time dependent spectrum '' ( etds ) procedure @xcite , which drops the requirement of a fast acquisition .",
    "all the above sinf experiments have been limited to small scattering angles , up to about @xmath0 , the main limitation being the numerical aperture of the collecting objective . by using larger numerical aperture ,",
    "the maximum detectable scattering angle can be increased , but , the @xmath1 limit remains inaccessible .    in this paper , we describe a novel detection scheme able to overcome this limitation and allowing detecting the scattered light up to the back scattering regime , ( more than @xmath1 ) .",
    "experimental data will be presented for scattering angles up to @xmath2 , almost four times larger than what ever reported in a previous sinf measurement .",
    "potentially the method can be extended to even larger scattering angles , approaching @xmath4 .",
    "the basic idea of the method is to illuminate the sample with a tilted beam of coherent light , whence the name of tilted laser microscopy ( tlm ) . indeed , whereas in a conventional sinf experiment a laser beam is sent through the sample along the axis of the collecting optics , in the described apparatus the laser beam enters into the system at a large angle with respect to the optical axis . in the proposed optical scheme , the aperture of the objective and the tilt angle are chosen so that the transmitted and the scattered beams are both collected by the objective .",
    "this approach is different from the classical `` dark field '' microscopy : in dark field the transmitted beam is deliberately removed , while in tlm the unscattered and scattered beams overlap .",
    "the importance of collecting the scattering at large angles lies in the fact that the scattered light can contain details which are very important for nanoparticle characterization .",
    "for example , very small particles scatter light almost isotropically , while larger ones ( sometimes contaminants or impurities ) scatter more strongly in the forward direction , and so often disturb the detection of the nanoparticle signal at low scattering angles .",
    "thus the possibility of distinguishing nanoparticles is directly related to the ability of getting information about the light scattered in the backward direction .",
    "the proposed technique is an answer to this problem of the low signal in nanoparticle scattering measurements . on the other hand ,",
    "the scattering signal frequently shows interesting features at large angles not accessible with traditional sinf methods .",
    "several scientific milestones of soft matter ( fractal dimension of colloidal aggregates , gel / glass properties , liquid crystals structures , etc . ) has been demonstrated by studying the structure factor of the system , up to high wave vectors .",
    "in this section the general ideas of light scattering are briefly and quantitatively reviewed , comparing the sinf outputs with the results of the classical siff technique .",
    "first , an informal and intuitive discussion about the physics of light scattering is provided , including a description of the traditional far field techniques .",
    "second , we discuss some peculiarities of the near field method , focusing on the heterodyne scheme . a more detailed and systematic description of siff can be found in classical references @xcite , whereas rigorous presentations of sinf can be found in @xcite .    generally speaking , a sample scatters light if its fluctuations of concentration and temperature induce refractive index fluctuations . in a standard light scattering experiment the intensity of the scattered light @xmath5",
    "is measured at a given scattering angle @xmath6 and azimuthal angle @xmath7 .",
    "then , for example , the scattering intensity from spherical colloids @xmath5 can be compared with the outcome of the exact mie algorithm for determining the particle size .",
    "a traditional siff experiment basically consists in measuring the scattered intensity at a given scattering angle selected by placing the detector along a given direction very far from the sample .",
    "the far field requirement is alternatively satisfied by placing a lens just beyond the sample and collecting the light at the lens focal plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_tutorial]-a ) .",
    "the intensity distribution thus obtained at the sensor plane exactly represents the far field   of the image .",
    "the effect of the lens is essentially that of performing the optical fourier transform of the signal .",
    "the image ( intensity mapping ) is speckled , but with a well defined average intensity distribution , representing the time averaged scattering intensity .",
    "the speckled appearance is due to the stochastic interference between the beams scattered in the same direction by the different scatterers .",
    "furthermore the 2d statistical intensity distribution of the speckles is an exponentially decaying function @xcite .",
    "if the sample is not static in time , the intensity of the speckle field is fluctuating ( boiling ) on a time scale depending on the scattering angle @xmath6 .",
    "for example , for a colloidal solution , the boiling is slow close to the forward direction @xmath8 , while it seems faster at larger angles .    in a sinf measurement , a near field image",
    "is collected either directly by a pixilated sensor placed in front of the sample , or via an optical imaging system ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_tutorial]-b ) .",
    "the scheme reported in fig .",
    "[ fig_tutorial]-b refers to shadowgraph technique , and is quite similar to hnfs configuration ; other sinf techniques are based on the same principle , with slightly different schemes .",
    "the near field image consists in the patterns generated by interference between the overlapping scattered beam and much more intense transmitted beam ( heterodyne detection ) .",
    "each scattered beam generates a fourier mode on the near field image ; thus the image decomposition into fourier modes allows the determination of the scattered beam intensities .",
    "indeed the near field image power spectrum ( ips ) is then calculated _ in silico _ by means of a 2d fast fourier transform software .",
    "the obtained ips is very similar to the far field image obtained in the siff experiment : essentially the same information is obtained by means of a software elaboration on the sinf image , instead of the optical fourier transform given by the siff image .",
    "however , some important differences between the ips and the far field image can be noticed .    1 .",
    "a single scattered beam gives rise to two points on the ips .",
    "for example the yellow beam of [ fig_tutorial]-b generates the two points marked with the yellow dots on the ips . in other words , the single yellow dot shown in the far field image of fig .",
    "[ fig_tutorial]-a corresponds to two yellow dots in the ips of fig .",
    "[ fig_tutorial]-b .",
    "this effect is related to a fundamental property of the fourier transform , which is not able to distinguish between the two symmetric beams generating a given mode within the image .",
    "2 .   the 2d statistical intensity distribution of the speckles in a sinf image has , with very good approximation , a gaussian distribution @xcite , resulting from heterodyne superposition of the scattered and transmitted beams .",
    "as already stated , the siff speckles show a 2d exponentially decaying statistics @xcite .",
    "3 .   also the dynamics is different : sinf and siff images are intrinsically related to the ccd exposure time in different ways . while different acquisition times in sinf correspond to a blurring of the fluctuations @xcite , in siff they correspond to different averages of speckle intensities . more explicitly , while in sinf a long exposure time reduces the power spectrum , in the siff case a long exposure time produces a less speckled appearance of the far field image .",
    "4 .   the most simple sinf schemes are heterodyne , so that they measure one of the complex components of the radiation field , while homodyne siff measures only the intensity . as consequence , a near field image carries information about the phases . as a result , it is easy to perform velocimetry with the sinf heterodyne signal @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "this sensitivity to phases can be seen as a drawback , since a diffusion measurement is vulnerable to collective motions .",
    "while the siff signal provides a direct measurements of the scattered intensity , the sinf signal ( the image power spectrum ) is related to the scattering intensity via the transfer function of the system .",
    "the latter one , depending on geometry and scattering angles , may introduce not negligible corrections .",
    "figure [ fig_tutorial_c ] schematically describes how the here proposed tlm setup works . basically , the scheme is analogous to the sinf design shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_tutorial]-b , with the difference that in the tilted scheme the transmitted beam enters into the objective at a given angle @xmath9 .",
    "thanks to the objective lens , a plane close to the sample is imaged on the 2d sensor , and this ensures that both the scattered and transmitted beams are overlapping and collected on the sensor .     with respect to the optical axis of the system .",
    "a near field image of a plane close to the sample is formed on the observation plane . the near field image power spectrum ( ips )",
    "is then evaluated through a fourier transform .",
    "the yellow beam generates two points ( yellow dots ) on the ips . ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     , for @xmath10 .",
    "data obtained with samples a , b , c , d , e. fitting lines are theoretical etds functions ( see eq .  [ eq_etdf ] ) , with decay time @xmath11 , and @xmath12 calculated with stokes einstein formula , using the values of nanoparticle diameters measured with dynamic siff and reported in tab .",
    "[ tab_samples ] . ]    fig .",
    "[ fig_dinamico ] shows a log - log plot of the etds measured as a function of exposure time @xmath13 , for @xmath10 , for the different samples a , b , c , d , e. fitting lines are theoretical etds functions ( see eq .

    "the data have been normalized so that the asymptotic value at short time is equal to 1 .",
    "we have used in the etds function a value of the nanoparticle diameter as measured with dynamic siff and reported in tab .",
    "[ tab_samples ] .",
    "the expected dependence @xmath14 is recognized .",
    "also this experiment confirms that tlm allows detection of the scattered light at @xmath1 .",
    "in the present paper , we have applied a new illumination geometry to a scattering in the near field set up in order to increase the range of available scattering angles of the technique .",
    "the apparatus is based on a microscope equipped with a coherent source of light not collinear with the objective optical axis ( tilted laser microscopy ) .",
    "this enables measuring both the static and dynamic spectra of the sample up to backscattering angles ( @xmath2 ) , which was never achieved before with a sinf set up .",
    "the improvement of the wave vector range over the state - of - the - art @xcite is of a factor 7 , and 3.5 with respect to our experiments @xcite .",
    "we introduced for the first time a non - trivial analysis algorithm necessary for extracting useful data .",
    "the data processing takes advantages of the etds approach to get access to time scales of the order of the camera minimum exposure time .",
