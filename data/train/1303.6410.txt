    "there are several numerical approximations schemes in the time direction for the numerical solution of nonlinear parabolic equations ( systems ) .",
    "linearized ( semi)-implicit schemes are the most popular ones since , at each time step , the schemes only require the solution of a linear system .",
    "however , time - step size restriction condition is always a key issue in analysis and computation . for many nonlinear parabolic systems , error analysis of finite element methods ( or finite difference method ) with linearized semi - implicit schemes in the time direction",
    "often requires certain time - step conditions .",
    "see @xcite for the navier - stokes equations , @xcite for the nonlinear joule heating problems , @xcite for flows in porous media , @xcite for viscoelastic fluid flow , @xcite for the kdv equations , @xcite for the ginzburg - landau equations , @xcite for the nonlinear schrdinger equations and @xcite for some other equations .",
    "such time - step size restrictions may result in the use of an unnecessarily small time - step size and extremely time - consuming in practical computations . to study the error estimate of linearized ( semi)-implicit schemes , the boundedness of numerical solution ( or error function ) in the @xmath3 norm or a stronger norm is often required .",
    "if a priori estimate for the numerical solution in such a norm can not be provided , one may employ the induction method with an inverse inequality to bound the numerical solution , such as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the finite element solution , @xmath7 is the exact solution and @xmath8 is certain projection operator .",
    "a time - step size restriction arises immediately from the above inequality , particularly for problems in three dimensional spaces .",
    "most previous works follow this idea .",
    "a new approach for unconditionally optimal error analysis of a linearized galerkin fem was pesented in our recent work @xcite , also see @xcite , where the error function is split into two parts , the spatially discrete error and the temporally discrete error , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the solution of a corresponding time - discrete parabolic equations ( or elliptic equations ) .",
    "optimal estimates for the second term can be obtained unconditionally in a traditional way if suitable regularity of the solution of the time - discrete system can be proved .",

    "the general equation is of stronger nonlinearity than those in @xcite and many physical equations are included .",

    "<S> the paper focuses on unconditionally optimal error analysis of the fully discrete galerkin finite element methods for a general nonlinear parabolic system in @xmath0 with @xmath1 . in terms of a corresponding time - discrete system of pdes </S>",
    "<S> as proposed in @xcite , we split the error function into two parts , one from the temporal discretization and one the spatial discretization . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the latter is @xmath2-independent and the numerical solution is bounded in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 norms by the inverse inequalities . with the boundedness of the numerical solution , optimal error estimates can be obtained unconditionally in a routine way . </S>",
    "<S> several numerical examples in two and three dimensional spaces are given to support our theoretical analysis .    </S>",
