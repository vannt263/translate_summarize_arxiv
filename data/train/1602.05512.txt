    "in the 1960s haken developed a framework for studying manifolds that contain incompressible surfaces .",
    "he demonstrated that for such manifolds , one can reduce the proofs of many theorems to induction arguments by using ",
    "hierarchies , \" consecutively cutting a manifold into pieces along incompressible surfaces until a collection of balls is obtained .",
    "this powerful approach clearly demonstrated the utility of incompressible surfaces in the study of low - dimensional topology .    in 1987",
    "casson and gordon introduced the idea of strongly irreducible surfaces @xcite .",
    "unlike incompressible surfaces which have no compressing disks , strongly irreducible surfaces have potentially many compressing disks to both sides , but any two compressing disks on opposite sides necessarily intersect .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , it turns out that many theorems that are easy to prove for manifolds with incompressible surfaces also hold true for manifolds with strongly irreducible surfaces , although the proofs can be somewhat more involved .",
    "casson and gordon s watershed result is that if a closed , connected , orientable 3-manifold s minimal genus heegaard splitting is not strongly irreducible , then the manifold must contain an essential surface @xcite .    in 2002 , bachman introduced the notion of a critical surface @xcite , which he followed in 2009 with the introduction of the concept of a topologically minimal surface @xcite .",
    "this latter definition provides the framework into which incompressible , strongly irreducible , and critical surfaces all fit : they are topologically minimal surfaces of index 0 , 1 , and 2 respectively . just like the incompressible and strongly irreducible surfaces before them , critical surfaces and topologically minimal surfaces in general have been used to prove long - standing conjectures that had remained unresolved for many years before then .",
    "bachman used these surfaces to prove the gordon conjecture is a connect sum of two heegaard splittings , and @xmath4 is stabilized , then one of its summands is stabilized . ] and to provide counterexamples to the stabilization conjecture @xcite .",
    "most of the work done thus far regarding topologically minimal surfaces deals specifically with surfaces which are heegaard splittings , two - sided surfaces that split a manifold into two compression bodies , so studying their compressing disks is a natural way to study a manifold .",
    "less is known about topologically minimal bridge spheres , which are a natural type of surface to consider when the 3-manifold is a link complement .",
    "lee has shown in @xcite that all bridge spheres for the unknot with any number of bridges in @xmath5 are topologically minimal , and his results provide upper bounds for the indices of such bridge spheres . in particular , he concludes that the bridge sphere for an unknot in a 3-bridge position has index exactly 2 ( i.e. , it is critical ) .    in this paper",
    "we provide the first known examples of topologically minimal bridge spheres of index 2 ( i.e. , critical bridge spheres ) for nontrivial links .",
    "our construction is inspired by recent work of johnson and moriah @xcite in which they construct links with bridge surface of arbitrarily high distance . the central result of this paper is the following :    [ thm : mainthm ] for any counting numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 , there exists an infinite family of @xmath2-component , @xmath3-bridge links whose bridge spheres are critical .    in section [ sec : defs ]",
    "we go over some of the foundational topological definitions upon which this paper relies , including the definition of a critical surface .",
    "then in section [ sec : platlinkdef ] we describe what it means for a link to be in a square plat position . following that , in section [",
    "sec : setting ] we embed a link @xmath6 in @xmath5 in a square plat position with bridge sphere @xmath7 and discuss some of the specific details of the embedding as well as build some of the tools ( certain arcs , disks , and projection maps ) which we will use throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "sections [ sec : platlinkdef ] and [ sec : setting ] should be considered setup for the rest of the paper , and this is essentially the same setup as in johnson and moriah s paper @xcite . in particular we make use of johnson and moriah s plat links and projection maps .",
