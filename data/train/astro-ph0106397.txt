    "in seeking to understand the nature and causes of activity in galaxy nuclei , we are conducting a multi - wavelength study of a well - defined sample of 21 radio - loud , early - type galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the sample contains all nearby ( @xmath1 ) , elliptical or s0 galaxies in the ugc catalog ( nilson 1973 ; magnitude limit @xmath2 , declination range @xmath3 and angular size @xmath4 ) that are extended radio - loud sources ( larger than 10  on vla a - array maps and brighter than 150 mjy from single dish flux measurements at 1400 mhz ) .",
    "all of these galaxies fall into fanaroff & riley s ( 1974 ) type - i ( fr - i ) radio classification ( see xu et al .",
    "2000 , for a description of the radio properties of our sample ) .",
    "though the black hole paradigm has become widely accepted as an essential ingredient in radio galaxies , the mechanics and time - scales of fueling and jet production are poorly understood . in unified schemes ( see urry & padovani 1995 for a review ) , which suggest the appearance of agn depends strongly on orientation , fr - i galaxies are thought to be the unbeamed population of bl - lac objects .",
    "understanding the central regions of such objects on scales of tens and hundreds of parsecs will allow us to better understand and characterize these connections .",
    "we have observed 19 of our sample galaxies with stis ( the space telescope imaging spectrograph ; see kimble et al .",
    "1998 ) , the sample members m84 and m87 having previously been observed by others . by placing three parallel slits adjacent to each other on the galaxy nuclei ( figure 1 ) along the stellar major axis we have obtained sets of spectra which allow us to map , for example , the kinematics and h@xmath0 + [ nii ] flux for the very central regions of each galaxy .",
    "by inspecting the velocity field of each galaxy it has been possible to classify them into three broad groups ( see also baum , heckman , & van breugel 1992 ) : _ rotators _ ; which show a clear , systematic , rotation pattern in their velocity field ( i.e. we observe a systematic gradient in velocity across the nucleus ) . _",
    "systematic non - rotators _ ; which show some kind of systematic behavior in their velocity field , but do not appear to be in rotation . _ undefined _ ; which do not show any clear pattern in their velocity fields .    initially we have made use of the mean velocity dispersion ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 , as estimators of the global parameters within some physical scale of the peak in emission line flux ( see table 1 ) .",

    "we fail to detect rotation in galaxies that have an axis ratio of their central light distribution @xmath23 ( with the exception of ngc 383 ) , i.e. the members of the sample with more nearly face - on central morphologies . bearing this in mind",
    ", we can not rule out the possibility that all of the sample galaxies harbor gas systems of the same type viewed from a range of orientations through different obscurations .",
    "in sample members where we have been able to identify systematic rotation in the nucleus , we have made estimates of the total mass enclosed in the central region by using the maximum and minimum velocities observed ( not corrected for the inclination ) and the radius over which they are separated ( see table 2 ) .",
    "further modeling will allow us to improve our central mass estimates and enable us to identify and characterize the contributions of the various components that we expect , in particular the contributions of stellar populations and supermassive black holes ( for example , by building on the work of van der marel & van den bosch 1998 ; marconi , et al .",
    "2001 ; sarzi , et al .  2001 ; or barth , et al .",
    "this modeling will also shed light on the relative importance of non - gravitational motions in the gas .",
    "an estimate of the anticipated black hole mass ( @xmath24 ) , computed using the relationship found by ferrarese & merritt ( 2001 ; see also gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) is provided in table 2 ( @xmath25 is the central velocity dispersion corrected to an @xmath26 aperture ) .",
    "we note that all of the enclosed masses calculated ( which are lower limits ) are greater than or similar to the black hole mass predicted from the ground based stellar kinematics using this relation as we would expect .",
