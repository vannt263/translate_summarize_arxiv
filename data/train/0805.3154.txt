    "this @xmath9 correlation appears to be intrinsically perfect , at least for a sample of nearby bright spiral and elliptical galaxies with clear dynamical smbh signatures .",
    "there is even a suggestion that the @xmath9 relation may hold for black holes on a much smaller mass scale of @xmath10  the intermediate mass black holes , or imbhs ( filippenko @xmath8 ho 2003 , barth et al .",

    "many of these correlations , admittedly , can simply be byproducts of the @xmath11 relation , since the velocity dispersion of a galaxy is a measure of its underlying potential .",
    "however , several observational and theoretical studies have linked the smbh mass with the mass of the host dark matter halo ( ferrarese 2002 , baes et al .",

    "this relation is a boon to theorists because many of the leading explanations of smbh birth and growth are driven by hierarchical structure formation ( hopkins et al .",

    "this means that although the seed formation stops at z@xmath112 as population iii supernovae rates drop to zero ( wise @xmath8 abel 2005 ) , smbh growth continues as dark matter halo mergers proceed to low redshifts .",

    "it is thought that these pop iii - generated seeds may form the smbhs we observe today ( soltan 1982 , schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) .    during a galaxy merger ,",
    "each black hole sinks to the center of the new galaxy potential due to dynamical friction and eventually becomes bound as a binary ( kazantzidis et al . 2005 ; escala et al .",
    "dynamical friction then continues to shrink the orbit until the binary is hard ( i.e , the separation between each black hole , @xmath14 , is such that the system tends to lose energy during stellar encounters ) ( heggie et al . 2007 ) .",
    "thereafter , further decay is mediated by 3-body scattering with the ambient stellar background until the binary becomes so close that the orbit can lose energy via gravitational radiation . in studies of static , spherical potentials",
    ", it may be difficult for stellar encounters alone to cause the binary to transition between the 3-body scattering phase and the gravitational radiation regime ( milosavljevic @xmath8 merritt 2003 ) .",
    "however , in gas - rich or non - spherical systems , the binary rapidly hardens and coalesces into one black hole , emitting copious gravitational radiation in the process ( mayer et al .",

    "2005 , berczik et al .",
    "2006 ; sigurdsson 2003 ; holley - bockelmann @xmath8 sigurdsson 2006 ) .    in our previous work , we calculated the cosmological merger rate for black holes between 200 - @xmath15 from redshift 20 - 0 ( micic et al .",
    "our approach combined high - resolution , small - volume cosmological n - body simulations with analytic prescriptions for the dynamics of merging black holes below our resolution limit ; this allowed us to explore different black hole growth mechanisms and seed formation scenarios while also accurately simulating the rich and varied merger history of the host dark matter halos . however , our original work treated the black hole merger timescales rather optimistically ; the black holes were said to merge immediately after the dark matter halos merge .",
    "in addition , we assumed that black hole seed formation is prolific , occurring in every dark matter halo capable of hosting a population iii star .",
    "the merger rates from micic et al .",
    "2007 , then , may be considered upper limits for a given black hole growth scenario .",
    "it is expected that only a fraction of first stars collapse into massive black holes .",
    "calculating this fraction would be trivial if the pop iii initial mass function is known .",
    "unfortunately , the initial mass function of the first stars is still very uncertain , mostly because the primordial fragmentation process is still very poorly understood ( nakamura @xmath8 umemura 2001 ; omukai @xmath8 yoshii 2003 ) .",
    "if the initial mass function for the first stars were top heavy ( schneider et al . 2002 ) , @xmath1 6 @xmath16 of the total mass in first stars would go into black holes after supernovae collapse . since half of the mass of each individual first star is ejected during a supernovae ( heger @xmath8 woosley 2002 ) , @xmath1 12 @xmath16 of first stars produce a black hole .",
    "hence , the fraction of the first stars that produce massive black holes could be as low as 10 @xmath16 , f@xmath17 = 0.1 ( schneider et al .",
    "this will have a direct consequence on the occupation fraction of halos with seed black holes at high redshift .",
    "unless the black hole binaries stall at the final parsec , the longest timescale governing the coalescence of two black holes occurs when the host galaxies themselves are still merging .",
    "here , the dynamical evolution of two merging galaxies is driven by the combined effect of dynamical friction that brings the less massive galaxy ( satellite ) to the center of the larger halo ( primary ) , and the tidal interaction that strips mass from the satellite ( e.g. richstone 1976 , aguilar @xmath8 white 1986 , holley - bockelmann @xmath8 richstone 1999 , taffoni et al .",
    "2003 ) and further delays the merger .",
    "if the dynamical friction timescale is longer than a hubble time , the black holes carried by their host galaxies will not be brought close enough to form a binary .",
    "this delay in the merger timescale can certainly reduce black hole merger rates .    in this paper , we continue to use this hybrid method to study how our predictions of black hole assembly changes when the effects of black hole seed formation efficiency and dynamical friction are introduced , and what effect these processes have on merger rates .",
    "we track the assembly of black holes over a large range of final masses  from seed black holes to smbhs  over widely varying dynamical histories .",
    "we also expand on a prescription to model the growth of the black hole from a seed to a supermassive black hole as a function of the merger history ; this prescription is physically motivated by simulations of star formation and feedback , captures the two most important mechanisms by which supermassive black holes assemble , and is very easy to implement in cosmological dark matter - only simulations . with this improved treatment of black hole dynamics and accretion ,",
    "we derive merger rates of dark matter halos and black holes as a function of mass ratio and redshift .",
    "these will be important observables for the laser interferometric space antenna ( lisa ) , a planned space mission to detect gravitational waves , set to launch in the next decade .",
    "we describe our method in section 2 and introduce the black hole growth prescription . in section 3",
    ", we present the results for both the growth of smbh in our volume and for the properties of rogue black holes ; this section includes black hole merger rates , dark matter halo merger rates in this low mass regime , and our derived black hole - host halo relation on this low mass end .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results and future work in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we give an overview for how we simulate our small cosmological volume , construct the dark matter halo merger trees , and model the black hole physics .      using gadget ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) , we performed a high - resolution cosmological n - body simulation within a comoving 10 mpc@xmath18 section of a @xmath19cdm universe ( @xmath20=0.3 , @xmath21=0.7 , @xmath22=0.9 and h=0.7 ) from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "we are using wmap1 ( bennett et al .",

    "2007 ) . a detailed description of this simulation can be found in micic et al .",
    "briefly , however , we identify high density region within a low - resolution cosmological volume that at @xmath4 hosts a dark matter halo comparable in size to the halo hosting the milky way galaxy . we then refine a sphere of 2 mpc around the halo of interest to simulate at a higher resolution with 4.9@xmath25 high - resolution particles ( softening length 2 kpc comoving ) .",

    "our n - body approach stops with the creation of the halo merger tree . to define the structure of each dark matter halo within the n - body generated merger tree , we assume a navarro , frenk , @xmath8 white ( hereafter , nfw ) density profile ( navarro , frenk @xmath8 white 1995 ) .",
    "we set the parameters of a given nfw halo using the approach presented in bullock et al .",

    "the initial mass function ( imf ) of these first stars is unclear , though , in part due to a lack of understanding of how primordial molecular hydrogen gas clouds fragment .",
    "it is expected that the imf may be top heavy .",
    "this is because the accretion rate onto the first stars is large ( omukai @xmath8 nishi 1998 , ripamonti et al .",
    "2002 ) and since dust grains are absent in primordial h@xmath45 gas clouds , the radiative feedback from the forming star is not strong enough to halt further gas accretion ( omukai @xmath8 palla 2003 , bromm @xmath8 loeb 2004 ) .",
    "the latest constraint of the first star s maximum mass comes from modeling the structure of the accretion flow and the evolution of protostars , and sets the maximum mass to @xmath1 300 @xmath32 .",

    "we do note that 10@xmath16 is a lower constraint and that much higher efficiency would not be unexpected . since the formation of the first stars is only limited , theoretically , by the minimum mass of the host dark matter halo ( wise @xmath8 abel 2005 ) , there is no expected correlation between the masses of first stars and the masses of their host halos .",
    "we choose our seed black hole mass to be @xmath46 in this work . in 100 realizations",
    ", we randomly select 10@xmath16 of dark matter halos that can host seed black holes and remove the rest of the seeds from our merger tree . the effect of the initial occupation fraction on the black hole merger rates is direct and dramatic , as can be seen in figure 3 .",
    "there are two important mechanisms that lead to the formation of a massive black hole binary at the center of a galaxy . first , dynamical friction expedites the merger of two dark matter halos and later the merger of the galaxies they host . in this manner ,",
    "merging galaxies can efficiently shepherd massive black holes to the center of the new system , roughly to the inner kiloparsec ( see colpi et al .",
    "2007 for a review ) .",
    "second , dynamical friction from the gas in the disk carries black holes deeper toward the galactic center where they form binary and eventually merge ( e.g. begelman , blandford @xmath8 rees 1980 , escala et al .",
    "2005 , kazantzidis et al .",
    "2005 , dotti et al .",
    "we model both effects as follows :    the time for a satellite to sink to the center of a primary can be approximated using chandrasekhar dynamical friction ( binney @xmath8 tremaine 1987 ) :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 . to define the satellite orbit , we adopt values suggested by numerical investigations ( colpi et al . 1999 ) and used in previous semi - analytical work ( volonteri et al .",

    "involved in the formation and later shrinking of the black hole binary are efficient and fast . due to tidal stripping and possible resonant interactions , simulations have shown that the chandrasekhar formula underestimates the merger time , especially in the case of minor mergers ( e.g. holley - bockelmann @xmath8 richstone 1999 , weinberg 1989 ) .",
    "if this is true , then semi - analytic studies of black hole merger rates using a chandrasekhar formalism for the merger time will overestimate the true number of black hole mergers .",
    "in an effort to better parametrize dynamical friction , boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2008 used n - body simulations to study dark matter halo merging timescales , and confirmed that the chandrasekhar formalism does underestimate the merger time , by a factor of @xmath49 1.7 for m@xmath39/m@xmath40 @xmath49 10 and a factor of @xmath1 3.3 for m@xmath39/m@xmath40 @xmath49 100 .",

    "we have calculated the dark matter halo merger rate with both chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula and the boylan - kolchin numerical fit . after showing the variance in dark matter halo merger rates from using the two expressions for the dynamical friction timescale ( figure 3 , discussed in section 3 )",
    ", we thereafter use the boylan - kolchin timescale for all other calculations .",
    "it is expected that in gas - rich galaxies , dynamical friction from the gas would bring two black holes close enough to form a binary whose orbit would shrink efficiently , passing quickly from a binary in the 3-body scattering phase to one emitting significant gravitational radiation ( escala et al .",

    "2005 , dotti et al .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that two black holes will sink from @xmath1 1 kpc to form a binary with a separation of less than a parsec in @xmath1 10 myrs .",
    "we incorporate this physics by calculating the dynamical friction timescale from the virial radius to the inner kpc , and then assume that the two black holes merge 10 myr afterward .",
    "in practice , the dynamical friction timescale from equations 1 and 2 from the inner kpc to the bound binary stage is often of order 10 myr ; the power of this gas - rich assumption lies in that it entirely circumvents the so - called final - parsec problem thought to exist for low mass ratio mergers of @xmath60 @xmath3 m@xmath61 @xmath62 within static , spherical , gas - poor galaxy models ( e.g. milosavljevic @xmath8 merritt 2003 ) .",
    "we explicitly assume that the black holes in our simulation do not stall at the final parsec before merger , and instead are ushered efficiently into the gravitational radiation stage , where they coalesce ; this assumption is verified even in the case of gas - poor galaxy models as long as the model is not spherical or in equilibrium ( e.g. holley - bockelmann @xmath8 sigurdsson 2006 , berczik et al . 2006 , r. spurzem , private communication ) .",
    "note that this implies that if we assume that each halo initially carries a black hole at its center , and that each host galaxy is gas - rich , figure 2 also estimates the time for a black hole to sink from the virial radius to the center of the host galaxy , become a bound black hole binary , and inspiral due to gravitational radiation .    in our initial work ( micic et al .",
    "2007 ) , mergers of dark matter halos trigger the immediate merger of the black holes they are hosting . in this paper , subsequent mergers of the central black holes are delayed to account for dynamical friction of the halos and the black holes within the galaxy .",
    "black holes will not merge if their merger time is larger than a hubble time , and in that case , we advance the black hole position within the primary halo at each timestep . knowing the dynamical friction timescale for each merger , we postpone the black hole mergers by moving them down the merger tree . for the final kpc , we assume that the ambient gas and non - sphericity will cause two black holes to coalesce within 10 myrs .",
    "the smbh in our model grows through a combination of black hole mergers and gas accretion .",
    "to better separate the effects of gas accretion on the black hole , we include a dry growth scenario , where the black hole grows through mergers only . to review the approach we have taken in a previous paper",

    "we distinguished two cases depending on the mass ratio of merging dark matter halos .",
    "the first is a more conservative criterion that allows black holes to accrete gas if the mass ratio of the host dark matter halo is less than 4:1 .",
    "the second case sets an upper constraint on the final black hole mass by allowing gas accretion as long as the merging dark matter halos have a mass ratio less than 10:1  on the cusp of what is considered a minor merger . since our black holes merged promptly after the halos merged , the accretion timescale and efficiency for major mergers was the same regardless of the mass ratio or redshift .    in this paper",
    ", we continue to model the black hole growth as one of extended gas accretion excited by major mergers . at high redshift ,",
    "this is likely a good assumption , though note that at low redshift when mergers are infrequent , secular evolution , such as bar instabilities , may dominate the gas ( and therefore black hole ) accretion .",
    "integrated over the whole of a black hole lifetime , though , this major merger - driven accretion is likely to be the dominant source of gas inflow .",
    "since the black hole growth is so strongly dependent on what fuel is driven to the center during galaxy mergers , it is important to characterize this merger - driven gas inflow , including the critical gas physics that may inhibit or strengthen this nuclear supply .",
    "we are motivated by a recent suite of numerical simulations that include radiative gas cooling , star formation , and stellar feedback to study the starburst efficiency for unequal mass ratio galaxy mergers ( cox et al .",

    "this study parametrizes the efficiency of nuclear star formation ( i.e. gas supply and inflow ) , @xmath37 , as a function of galaxy mass ratio :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 defines the mass ratio below which there is no enhancement of nuclear star formation ( i.e. gas inflow ) . here",
    ", the gas accretion efficiency has a maximum of 0.56 for 1:1 halo mergers and falls to zero at @xmath70 .",

    "black hole mergers postponed for longer than the hubble time will not occur , which reduces the merger rate over all redshifts . in the absence of dynamical friction , there are 1447 black hole mergers in our volume between redshifts 20 and 0 ; this number reduces to 1248 with chandrasekhar dynamical friction , and 1063 with a boylan - kolchin estimate for the dynamical friction decay time .    the number of dark matter halo mergers per unit redshift per year is presented in figure 3 ( thick line ) .",
    "this halo merger rate directly corresponds to the black hole merger rate when the black holes merge immediately after their host halos .",
    "when chandrasekhar dynamical friction is introduced to the black hole merger tree ( figure 3 , dashed line ) the black hole merger rates decrease over all redshifts except at z @xmath3 2.7 , as the mergers that have been delayed from higher redshift begin to occur .",
    "the black hole merger rate is maximum at z=11 without dynamical friction , and at this redshift the rate decreases by a factor of 1.5 for chandrasekhar dynamical friction .",
    "this reduction in the black hole merger rate is even more pronounced when we use the boylan - kolchin equation for the merger timescale ( figure 3 , dotted line ) , dropping the merger rate by a factor of two .",
    "those mergers that are postponed but have a merging timescale less than a hubble time will be pushed down the merger tree toward lower redshifts .",
    "this is made explicit in figure 4 , which plots the average change in redshift for a merger as a function of redshift if one includes dynamical friction .",
    "black hole mergers at redshift 10 are , on average , pushed to redshift 6 , for example .",
    "this results in an increase in the black hole merger rate at low redshifts .",
    "we can see this clearly in figure 3 ; although the maximum merger rate at redshift z=11 has dropped , the number of mergers is larger than the chandrasekhar merger rate at z @xmath3 6 ( and therefore also larger than without dynamical friction at z @xmath3 2.7 ) .",
    "again , this is because dynamical friction postpones mergers longer with the boylan - kolchin formula .",
    "this suggests higher lisa merger rates at low redshifts than any estimate that used the chandrasekhar formula .",
    "in addition , since each merger occurs at a lower redshift , it will certainly be a louder gravitational wave source , and any associated electromagnetic signature will be brighter , as well .",
    "we will return to the lisa detectability in a future paper .",
    "interestingly , including dynamical friction from gas at distances smaller than 1 kpc does not make difference in our merger rates .",
    "those black holes that reach 1 kpc from the galactic center will reach a parsec even without the gas  the gas timescale is simply invoked to ensure that the black holes pass through the 3-body scattering stage efficiently . for the rest of this paper , we adopt the boylan - kolchin dynamical friction fit as a realistic treatment of the black hole merger timescale .    in order to address the effect of inefficient black hole seed formation on the black hole merger rates , we randomly seed only @xmath76 of those halos that could host a pop iii star with a @xmath77 black hole .",
    "we ran 100 realizations of this process , applying boylan - kolchin merger timescales as described above .",
    "these rates are presented at the bottom of figure 3 with maximum of range 2 - 3 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this is a pessimistic scenario since it suggests that only 10@xmath16 of dark matter halos are capable of hosting a seed black hole .",
    "future work on this subject will give more realistic predictions for pop iii seeding efficiency , but we point out that even with our lowest estimate for the number of black hole seeds , the predicted lisa merger rate of 2 - 3 yr@xmath2 makes this population a reliable gravitational wave source .    by design of our small volume simulation , we have only one smbh in our volume sitting a halo with @xmath78 , roughly the mass of the milky way halo .",
    "figure 5 shows the smbh mass at the center of the primary halo as a function of redshift .",
    "smbh growth without dynamical friction is presented with thin lines for the three scenarios ( dry growth , 4:1 growth , and 10:1 growth ) described previously .",
    "the thick lines present corresponding growth models with dynamical friction .",
    "the first merger of the primary dark matter halo with a satellite occurs at redshift z=14.2 ; without dynamical friction , that is also the redshift of the first black hole merger .",
    "this merger is postponed until z=11.7 when dynamical friction is added . in our model , major mergers are followed by the episodes of gas accretion which can be identified in figure 5 as rapid increases in the smbh mass .",
    "a great example of how smbh mergers are postponed by dynamical friction can be seen in the change in smbh mass for the redshift range 4.7 @xmath3 z @xmath3 6.1 .",
    "although the last major merger of the primary halo is at z=6.1 ( figure 5 , thin dash - dot line ) , the smbh at the center of the primary halo undergoes at least three rapid increases in mass in the 10:1 growth model ( figure 5 , thick dash - dot line ) for the redshift range 4.7 @xmath3 z @xmath3 6.1 .",
    "these are from satellite mergers originating at higher redshift .",
    "redshift 4.7 marks the end of the gas accretion era for the smbh , well after it experiences its last major merger .",
    "the smbh is close to its final mass at this time , as the only channel left in our model for increasing its mass is via black hole mergers .",
    "we note that the 10 next most massive black holes all reach their final mass at varying redshifts between 10 and 1 , though in our volume , these black holes are @xmath79 .",
    "the range for the smbh mass set by the 4:1 and 10:1 dynamical friction growth models is 1.7@xmath80 @xmath3 m@xmath81 @xmath3 1.3@xmath82 .",
    "if we neglect dynamical friction , the black hole masses are unphysically large .",
    "dynamical friction removes 27@xmath16 of the total number of initially merging black holes because these will take longer than a hubble time to coalesce .",
    "all other black holes merge later , and these effects both prevent the seed from accumulating a large mass early on to use as a base for salpeter accretion phases .",
    "the effect of delaying and removing the mergers outweighs the longer accretion timescales seen when dynamical friction is included .",
    "figure 6 shows the universal merger rates for those dark matter halos that merge in less than a hubble time within the mass range 10@xmath83 @xmath3 m@xmath84 @xmath3 10@xmath85 , for various mass ratios and combined masses of merging dark matter halos .",
    "black holes seeded in halos in the middle and bottom panels grow through mergers only and never accrete , while gas accretion impacts black hole growth in 4:1 and 10:1 halo mergers ( figure 6 , upper panel ) . in our volume , all the mergers that occur at redshifts z @xmath3 2 will not finish in less than a hubble time , as these mergers are all high mass ratio .",
    "we remind the reader , though , that these halo merger rates are extrapolated from our 10 mpc simulation box ; a better global rate for these low mass halos will be achieved with more of these volumes .    since the merger timescale is larger for higher mass ratio halos , the black hole gas accretion time scale is longer , as well .",

    "the number of accreting black holes as a function of redshift is presented in figure 8 .",

    "the number of accreting black holes reduces by @xmath1 200 at redshift 4.7 , from a few hundred accreting black holes to a few tens .",
    "this corresponds to the redshift at which the smbh at the center of the primary halo stops accreting gas from the previous major merger .",
    "those black holes that are still accreting gas at z @xmath3 4.7 are mostly rogue black holes at the outskirts of the primary halo .",
    "we will discuss these more in the next subsection .",
    "the last episode of gas accretion by the smbh is also an epoch during which the smbh accumulates largest amount of mass .",

    "thereafter , the gas accretion is extremely damped ; although this smbh is far too low mass to be considered a high luminosity agn analogue , it may be appropriate to link this smbh with a low luminosity agn ( ho 2008 ) .",
    "we divide the universal black hole merger rates as a function of redshift in figure 10 into different binary mass ratios and total binary mass ranges , where p = log ( m@xmath88 + m@xmath89 ) is a measure of the total binary black hole mass .",

    "then , these halos are still orbiting at significant distances from the primary center  and although the halos themselves have been stripped by the primary potential , they are still embedded with massive black holes .",
    "figure 12 displays the number of these rogue black holes as a function of the distance from the primary center at redshift zero . for a primary scaled to the milky way",
    ", this implies that roughly 1 - 10 of these massive black holes in orbit at the solar radius .    given the merger - driven accretion scenario described in the previous section",
    ", we can determine the mass of these black holes at redshift zero .",
    "figure 13 shows the mass of each rogue as a function of distance from the primary center ; each black hole is color - coded to keep track of when the satellite halo entered the virial radius of the primary .",
    "note that the most massive of these black holes are embedded in satellites that have themselves undergone mergers before entering the primary halo at redshift @xmath94 .",
    "this preprocessing via prior mergers allows the black holes to enter the primary halo at later times with higher masses ; these most massive rogues remain at roughly half the virial radius by redshift zero .",
    "there is sufficient evidence that the halos of galaxies , from massive ellipticals to isolated spirals , can host diffuse hot halo gas ( matthews @xmath8 brighenti 2003 , osullivan 2001 , pedersen et al .",
    "2006 ) . as these black holes orbit within the primary halo",
    ", they can accrete from this ambient hot halo gas via bondi - hoyle accretion . here",
    ", the mass accretion rate can then be described by :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the density of the halo gas , @xmath97 is the gas sound speed , and @xmath98 is the velocity of the black hole .",
    "for these rogue black holes , we add this more quiescent form of accretion from the time the black hole has entered the virial radius of the halo in order to determine whether any of these rogue black holes may be visible today . to model the hot halo gas , we assume it has an isothermal density profile consistent with x - ray observations of halo gas in ellipticals ( matthews @xmath8 brighenti 2003 ) , and that the ideal gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential of the halo .",
    "we assume a gas core radius of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the scale radius of the nfw halo , and that the gas temperature is the virial temperature at the virial radius .",
    "this yields a central gas temperature of @xmath101 for a dark matter halo of mass @xmath102 , which is also consistent with observations ( petersen et al .",
    "at redshift zero , we assume the black holes are on bound elliptical orbits of eccentricity @xmath103 to match simulation predictions for satellite mergers ( e.g. ghigna et al .",

    "the radiated luminosity from this process can be determined from @xmath105 , where @xmath106 describes how efficiently mass is converted to energy ; the standard assumption for an accretion disk around a spinning black hole sets @xmath107 ( shakura @xmath8 syunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "we find that our most massive rogue black holes can radiate at @xmath108 ( figure 14 ) , making them somewhat fainter than the brightest ulxs ; the fact that the hot halo gas is so tenuous at these radii is what accounts for the relatively low luminosity .",
    "however , if these rogue black holes are common , they will be observable in the outskirts of the milky way halo with chandra , and the most luminous can have sufficient signal - to - nose for spectral characterization .",
    "note , though , that a significant fraction of these may have advection - dominated accretion flows , rather than proper accretion disks , and hence @xmath106 may be much less than 0.1 ; this would naturally make the black hole less luminous , but with a harder spectral signature .",
    "even if they are not observable electromagnetically , they may be detected by mesolensing ( di stefano 2007 ) .      for dark matter halo masses above roughly @xmath109 ,",
    "the dark matter halo mass correlates well with the mass of the supermassive black hole ( ferrarese 2002 ) :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 is the dark matter halo mass . below this mass",
    ", there is tentative evidence that halos are less effective at forming massive black holes , and may even be unable to form them ( ferrarese 2002 ) . to be fair , though , if this relation does hold down to a @xmath112 halo , the expected @xmath113 black hole would be difficult to detect , observationally .",
    "in our volume , there are few halos with masses @xmath114 by redshift zero , so our sample is limited .",
    "however , we can still find the final black hole and halo mass for every black hole that has undergone some accretion by redshift zero .",
    "this is plotted in figure 15 .",
    "notice that our single smbh in the volume is consistent with the @xmath115 relation for a 10:1 growth scenario , and many of our lower mass black holes do as well .",
    "there are a few tidally - stripped satellite halos on the low mass end that host overweight black holes .",
    "in addition , those dark matter halos with sparse merger histories host underweight black holes . this may point to a dependence of the black hole mass on environment . we will be able to explore this more carefully with the set of simulations currently underway .",
    "previous work on black hole merger rates use semi - analytical models based on extended press - schechter theory ( eps ) , and the dynamical friction in these models uses the chandrasekhar formalism .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained from eps theory .",
    "figure 16 shows the merger rates for four press - schechter models described in sesana et al .",
    "2007 . in the vhm model , massive dmhs ( m@xmath84=10@xmath116 - 10@xmath117 @xmath32 )",

    "the best match to our model is the kbd model , though their seed black holes are more massive .",
    "this match is not surprising since the range of seeding redshifts and the halo mass range are similar to ours .",
    "our merger rate at high redshift is larger because we seed black holes in a wider mass range of dark matter halos . at z",
    "@xmath3 11 , however , kbd merger rates are larger since they use chandrasekhar dynamical friction , which underestimates the merger timescale .",
    "this simple rate comparison of merger rates , however , neglects the larger differences in black hole masses and the mass ratio of each merger .",
    "using a small volume cosmological n - body simulation to construct the merger history of low mass dark matter halos , we have studied the growth and merger rate of black holes from seeds at redshift 20 to low mass smbhs at redshift zero , analytically incorporating the important sub - resolution physics to model the black hole dynamics and gas accretion .",
    "we found that the method used to estimate the dynamical friction timescale makes a large difference in the total rate and redshift distribution of black hole mergers ; for example , the merger rate is smaller at higher redshift z @xmath38 6 with an n - body based dynamical friction estimate ( boylan - kolchin 2008 ) than with the chandrasekhar dynamical friction approximation , because this approximation underestimates the true merger time .",
    "if most of the black hole growth is tied to gas accretion that is activated by major mergers , then using the chandrasekhar dynamical friction approximation will overestimate the mass of the black hole .",
    "moreover , these larger , more realistic merger timescales will postpone black hole mergers to lower redshifts , which increases the black hole merger rate at z @xmath3 6 .",
    "we find that the maximum black hole merger rate is r @xmath122 at z @xmath123 .",
    "however , when a pop iii seed formation efficiency of 0.1 is adopted , the maximum merger rate falls to r @xmath124 .",
    "this scenario is based on the most pessimistic picture of the evolution of the first stars ; future work will constrain the occupation fraction of seed black holes . however , even with such a low pop iii formation efficiency , and a larger merger timescale than has previously been used , the merger rate is large enough for smbh mergers to remain an important lisa source .",
    "we also introduce an expression for the growth of a black hole that includes direct mergers of the black hole and eddington - limited accretion driven by major mergers .",
    "we use the merger time starting from the first pericenter passage of the incoming black hole to set the gas accretion timescale , and we weighted the efficiency of accretion by the available gas in the galaxy nucleus , which has been carefully studied for unequal mass galaxy mergers ( cox et al . 2008 ) . with this black hole growth scenario",
    ", we find that if we define a major merger as one with a @xmath125 halo mass ratio , the final smbh mass at the center of a milky way type halo is m@xmath61 = 1.7@xmath80 .",
    "if , instead , we adopt a more lenient definition of a major merger ( 10:1 ) , @xmath126 = 1.3@xmath82 .",
    "this first value is similar to the mass of the smbh observed at the center of our galaxy , while the second is consistent with the mass at the center of m31 .",
    "hence , we have shown in this study that not only is it possible to grow these low mass smbhs from very light pop iii remnants , but that most of the smbh mass can be accounted for with a combination of major merger - driven gas accretion and direct black hole mergers .",
    "we emphasize that with a growth prescription that is so strongly tied to major galaxy mergers , it is possible to have low mass black holes in place at high redshift and not accreting strongly thereafter .",
    "in fact , the most massive black hole in our small volume grew most rapidly for a short span around redshift 4.5 ; thereafter , it was quiescent .",
    "this may seem in direct contradiction to previous observational studies that have argued for the `` anti - hierarchical '' growth of black holes , meaning that the most massive smbhs accrete most at high redshift , while the lower mass smbhs are still accreting ( and grow the most ) at @xmath127 ( merloni 2004 , marconi et al .",
    ". this apparent contradiction may not be so clear , however .",
    "first , the black holes in our volume were lower mass than what is typically considered in the local census of relic agn .",
    "second , these observational studies are based on linking the observed local black hole mass function to high redshift agn assuming that these black holes grow only by gas accretion ( and not merging ) with a single accretion efficiency .",
    "our black holes would not be able to grow to @xmath128 without a rich merger history .",
    "third , our simulations do not explicitly include any of the more quiescent black hole growth modes , such as bar - driven gas inflow , stellar tidal disruption , compact object capture , and sub - eddington bondi - hoyle - littleton accretion from the surrounding gaseous medium .",
    "these may very well act to increase the growth rate of some of the black holes in our simulation at lower redshift sargent ( 1997 ) found that there barred galaxies do not increase the strength or frequency of the agn ] .",
    "however , if this form of growth were to dominate at @xmath127 for the smbh in our volume , the smbh would be too massive .",
    "finally , we appeal to cosmic variance ; our volume was selected to be a sparse group environment , and as such , smbhs were rare .",
    "if galaxy merger - driven inflow , direct black hole mergers , and these more quiescent forms of black hole accretion all play roles in the assembly of low mass smbhs , each growth channel may have a different strength as a function of environment .",
    "we are running several high - resolution , small volume simulations to tackle this issue .    in this paper , we have neglected gravitational wave recoil , a potentially important mechanism that may inhibit black hole growth .",
    "binary black holes strongly radiate linear momentum in the form of gravitational waves during the plunge phase of the inspiral  resulting in a `` kick '' to the new black hole .",
    "this , in itself , has long been predicted as a consequence of an asymmetry in the binary orbit or spin configuration .",
    "previous kick velocity estimates , though , were either highly uncertain or suggested that the resulting gravitational wave recoil velocity was relatively small , astrophysically speaking .",
    "now , recent results indicate the recoil can drive a gravitational wave kick velocity as fast as @xmath14000@xmath129 ( herrmann et al .",
