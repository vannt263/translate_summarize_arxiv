    "about 5% of all hot subdwarf stars ( sdb , sdo ) show he - enriched surface abundances ( he - sdb , he - sdo ) .",
    "while most normal h - rich subdwarfs are supposed to be low mass core he - burning stars with atmospheres dominated by h due to the action of gravitational settling , the evolutionary status of the he - rich subclass is less clear .",
    "he - rich subdwarfs have been suggested to be the result of either he white dwarf mergers @xcite or late helium core flashes @xcite .",
    "regardless the particular scenario proposed for their formation , it is accepted that some of these stars are still contracting towards the he - core burning phase ( ehb ) , as otherwise gravitational settling of the remaining h would have turned the star into a h - rich sdb star .",
    "two families of pulsators have been discovered within the h - rich sdb stars : the rapid pulsators ( sdbvr ; @xcite ) discovered by @xcite , and the slow pulsators ( sdbvs ; @xcite ) discovered by @xcite .",
    "while sdbvr stars show short pulsation periods ( @xmath3 s ) ascribed to radial modes and non - radial @xmath4-modes , sdbvs pulsations ( with periods @xmath5 s ) are associated to non - radial long period @xmath1-modes .",
    "pulsations in both groups of variable stars have been explained by the action of the @xmath6-mechanism due to the partial ionization of iron group elements in the outer layers , where these elements are enhanced by the action of radiative levitation @xcite .",
    "while many sdbv stars are known , only one he - sdb star , ls iv-14@xmath0116 , has been found to be a pulsator .",
    "in fact , ls iv-14@xmath0116 is a very intriguing object : while its atmospheric parameters ( @xmath7 and @xmath1 ) place it well within the sdbvr instability region @xcite , it displays periods typical of the sdbvs family of pulsators . from a spectroscopical perspective , ls iv-14@xmath0116 is also an intriguing object , showing a mild he - enrichment ( @xmath8 ) and very high excesses of zirconium , yttrium and strontium in its atmosphere @xcite . in this sense , both the he - enrichment and the heavy metal excesses might be related to the effects of ongoing diffusion before reaching diffusive equilibrium , thus placing the star in the pre - ehb phase . up to now",
    ", the driving mechanism behind the long period pulsations of ls iv-14@xmath0116 , as well as the absence of short period pulsations , remains a mistery and the star poses a challenge to the theory of stellar pulsations @xcite . in this connection ,",
    "the recent confirmation of both the multiperiodic variability and the @xmath9 values for ls iv-14@xmath0116 @xcite strongly increase the enigma .",
    "while most pulsations exhibited by pulsating stars ( included those of sdbvs and sdbvr stars ) are self excited through the classical @xmath6-mechanism , no star has been discovered so far to be excited by the @xmath2-mechanism .",
    "the only possible exception are some oscillations in @xmath10 scuti stars @xcite and pg 1159 stars @xcite , but neither of these have been confirmed . in the @xmath2-mechanism , the driving is due to the strong dependence of nuclear burning rates on temperature . in the layers where nuclear reactions take place ,",
    "thermal energy is gained at compression by the enhancement of nuclear energy liberation , while the opposite happens during the expansion phase @xcite .    in the present letter",
    "we show that long period @xmath1-mode pulsations , like those observed in ls iv-14@xmath0116 , can be understood as driven by the @xmath2-mechanism acting during the unstable shell burning events that take place before the star settles on the he - core burning phase .",
    "in addition , our scenario might explain the intriguing absence of short period @xmath4-mode pulsations in ls iv-14@xmath0116 .",
    "in the light of our results , ls iv-14@xmath0116 would be the first star in which pulsations driven by the @xmath2-mechanism have been detected , thus being the first proof that the @xmath2-mechanism can indeed drive pulsations in stars .",

    "stellar structure and evolution equations have been solved with lpcode stellar evolution code as in our previous works ( and references therein ) . although our computations have been performed within the hot - flasher scenario , the existence of he - shell subflashes in both the hot - flasher and merger scenarios makes our approach valid regardless the actual origin of ls iv-14@xmath0116 .    as seen in fig .",

    "for each model we restricted ourselves to explore the @xmath17 @xmath1-modes in the period range from 500 to 6000 s. the stability analysis of the stellar models was carried out by means of the linear , nonradial , nonadiabatic pulsation code described in with the inclusion of the @xmath2-mechanism mode driving operating in he - burning layers as described in @xcite .",
    "two standard simplifications have been introduced .",
    "we have adopted the `` frozen - in convection '' approximation in the stability analysis and we have assumed that @xmath18 in the non - perturbed background model adopted in the computations . while the latter is not rigorously true in contracting stellar models , the timescale of the he - subflashes ( @xmath19 yr ) is nonetheless much longer than the oscilation periods ( @xmath20 s ) , and this approximation is correct . to assess the validity of `` frozen - in convection '' approximation we computed the turn - over timescale of convection at the peak of the helium flashes as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the radial coordinates of the boundaries of the convective zone and @xmath24 is the velocity of the convective elements within the mixing length theory of convection . as seen in the fourth column of table [ tabla ] , the convective turnover times are much longer than the unstable periods obtained in this work ( see fig .

    "the bottom panel illustrates the situation for the first and strongest flash of the series and shows the derived e - folding times for each mode .",
    "notably , modes are continuously destabilized during the whole flash , with e - folding times ( @xmath31 ) of the excited modes getting shorter than the duration of the pulse ( @xmath32 ) , indicating that these modes should attain observable amplitudes ( see also table [ tabla ] ) .",
    "while the whole evolution from the primary he - flash to the ehb takes about 2 myr , the unstable stages add up to @xmath33 yr ( see table [ tabla ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this refers to the formally unstable stage , including some stages with somewhat long e - folding times , and that the actual unstable phases might be shorter .",
    "then , within this picture , we would expect the variable to non variable ratio of he - sdb to be lower than @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth noting that this is consistent with the fact that only one he - sdb star , out of 23 studied objects , has been found to be a variable . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : peri_lumi ] , most unstable modes exhibit periods in the range @xmath35 s close to the periods observed in ls iv-14@xmath0116 ( 1954 - 5084 s ) , and definitely much longer than the periods displayed by sdbvr stars in the same region of the @xmath30 plane . in particular , it is worth noting that our models are able to reproduce the dominant periodicity observed in ls iv-14@xmath0116 ( @xmath36 s ) .",
    "our computations show that not all modes with periods within the unstable range are excited .",
    "in fact , only modes with significant amplitudes in the he - burning shell are destabilized .",

    "this behavior , in which the @xmath2-mechanism acts as a narrow band filter exciting only modes with large amplitudes in the narrow he - burning shell region , has been reported in previous works @xcite .",
    "it has been mentioned @xcite that the effect of the enhancement of he in nonadiabatic computations in the context of the @xmath6-mechanism in sdb stars might be related with the pulsations observed in ls iv-14@xmath0116 . as a consequence , once might wonder to which extent our results are related with the @xmath6-mechanism .",
    "also , one might wonder to which extent the so called `` convective blocking '' mechanism @xcite at the he - shell flash convective zone might help to destabilize the modes . in order to check our results ,",
    "we have carried out explicit tests by switching off the derivatives of @xmath37 in our nonadiabatic computations . as expected , when the @xmath2-mechanism is turned off , all unstable modes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : peri_lumi ] become stable , indicating that the driving mechanism behind the unstable modes is indeed the @xmath2-mechanism alone .    .",

    "lines indicate the periods detected in ls iv-14@xmath0116 , with their width being propotional to the amplitude of each mode @xcite.,width=283 ]    as mentioned in previous paragraphs , our results suggest that the periods of unstable modes become shorter when the star experiences deeper subflashes , that is , when the burning shells move towards the core .",
    "one might then wonder where should the shell be located in order to excite modes with periods embracing the whole range of periods observed in ls iv-14@xmath0116 . in this connection , we performed a numerical experiment by artificially shifting outwards the location of the burning shell in our nonadiabatic computations .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimento ] , it would be enough to shift the location of the shell to @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) to excite modes with periods covering the complete range of observed periods of ls iv-14@xmath0116 .",
    "interestingly enough , this location is completely within the range of locations of the burning shells in the merger scenario ( see figures 2 and 3 of @xcite ) . whether this means that ls iv-14@xmath0116 is a post - merger object or that he - shell subflashes develop differently from that current stellar evolution models predict ( as suggested by recent 3d hydro - simulations of the event ;",
    ") should be object of further study .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath2-mechanism is able to excite pulsations in the he - sdb star ls iv-14@xmath0116 . although our computations have been performed within the hot - flasher scenario , the existence of he - shell subflashes in both the hot - flasher and merger scenarios makes our conclusions valid regardless the actual origin of ls iv-14@xmath0116 .",
    "our results strongly suggest that long period @xmath1-mode pulsations exhibited by ls iv-14@xmath0116 are driven by the @xmath2-mechanism .",
    "if so , it is the first confirmation that the @xmath2-mechanism can drive pulsations in stars . interestingly ,",
    "if ls iv-14@xmath0116 is a star in a fast evolutionary phase then iron and nickel might not have had enough time to accumulate in the driving region and drive @xmath4-mode pulsations , thus explaining also the intriguing absence of these modes in ls iv-14@xmath0116 lightcurve .",
    "the fact that our model covers only partially the range of periods observed in ls iv-14@xmath0116 might be related to the possibility that the star is a post - merger object , in which the locations of the he - flash shells are different from those of hot - flasher objects .",
    "in fact , the numerical experiment performed in the previous section suggest that nonadiabatic computations of the @xmath2-mechanism on post - merger stellar models might show better agreement with the observed periods of ls iv-14@xmath0116",
    ". computations of the @xmath2-mechanism in post - merger he - sdb stellar models would be very valuable .",
    "in short , we have shown that the ls iv-14@xmath0116 atmospheric values ( @xmath7 , @xmath1 and @xmath41 ) , the existence of long period @xmath1-mode pulsations , and possibly the absence of the classic @xmath6-mechanism @xmath4-mode pulsations can be simultaneously explained if ls iv-14@xmath0116 is as star undergoing a he - shell flash in its way towards the ehb .",
