    "it is well known that the distribution of nearby galaxies in the optical color - magnitude diagram is bimodal ; quiescent , early - type galaxies populate a narrow red sequence and star - forming , late - type galaxies form a big blue cloud ( e.g. , strateva et al .",

    "recent studies however reveal that the optical red sequence contains not only early - type galaxies with signs of recent star formation ( e.g. , yi et al . 2005 ; bressan et al .",
    "2006 ; schawinski et al .",

    "2010 ; ko et al .",

    "; gallazzi et al . 2009 ; wolf et al .",
    "2009 ; masters et al . 2010",
    "; ko et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the presence of various types of galaxies on the red sequence is easily found when one examines these red - sequence galaxies at different wavelengths .",
    "the near - ultraviolet ( uv ) observations show a diversity of early - type galaxies depending on the amount of recent star formation ( e.g. , ferreras & silk 2000 ; yi et al .",
    "2005 ; schawinski et al . 2007 ;",
    "kaviraj et al .",
    "the mid - infrared ( ir ) observations also show that a significant fraction of nearby early - type galaxies has excess flux over the photospheric emission ( e.g. , bressan et al .",

    "the optical colors of galaxies can be red enough to join the red sequence just 1@xmath42 gyr after the stop of major episodes of star formation ( e.g. , bower et al .",
    "1998 ; poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , previous studies of early - type galaxies on the red sequence showed the large scatter in the near - uv  optical color - magnitude diagrams , which can not be explained without some amounts of recent star formation ( e.g. , ferreras & silk 2000 ; deharveng et al .",
    "thanks to the galaxy evolution explorer ( _ galex _ ; martin et al .",
    "2005 ) , it is generally accepted that the near - uv optical color can be an excellent indicator of recent star formation ( @xmath8 1 gyr ) even for a small amount of star formation ( e.g. , @xmath91% of stellar mass ) .",
    "this is mainly because the near - uv light is much more sensitive to young stars than the bluest optical band .",
    "balmer absorption lines are also useful indicators of recent star formation because they trace intermediate - age stars ( strongest for a - type stars ) that dominate the light of a galaxy 1@xmath41.5 gyr after active star formation stops ( dressler & gunn 1983 ; couch & sharples 1987 ) .",
    "recently , choi et al . (",
    "2009 ) studied the possible connection of the uv - excess early - type galaxies to e+a galaxies ( i.e. , post - starburst ) using @xmath91000 e+as selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) data .",
    "they found that the post - starburst systems such as e+as are characterized by the uv excess without h@xmath1 emission .",
    "they suggested that the balmer absorption line used for identifying e+as can be replaced by near - uv  optical colors that are much sensitive to recent star formation .",
    "the mid - ir emission from dusty circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars is an also useful indicator of star formation history because it traces stars with ages from a few 0.1 gyr up to the hubble time ; low- to intermediate - mass stars evolve into the agb phase and their mid - ir emissions decrease with stellar age .",
    "frogel et al . (",
    "1990 ) found that the contribution of agb stars to the bolometric luminosity could be larger than 40% at ages from 1.1 to 3.3 gyr , but rapidly decreases down to 5% at 10 gyr .",
    "recent stellar population models ( e.g. , maraston 2005 ; bruzual 2009 ) suggest that agb stars with 0.1@xmath41.5 gyrs can contribute up to @xmath9 50% of the @xmath10-band light in galaxies .",
    "although the understanding of agb dust envelopes and their contribution to the mid - ir emission in a galaxy is far from complete ( e.g. , marigo et al .",
    "2008 ) , recent mid - ir observations show that a significant fraction of early - type galaxies on the red - sequence have excess flux over photospheric emission ( ko et al . 2009 , 2012 ;",
    "shim et al .",
    "2011 ; hwang et al .",
    "2012 ) . unusual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are also detected in the mid - ir spectra of early - type galaxies ( e.g. , kaneda et al .",
    "2008 ; vega et al . 2010",
    "; panuzzo et al .",
    "2011 ) even though the pah emission is a typical feature of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , peeters et al .",
    "this unusual pahs in early - type galaxies seems to result from because of material continuously released by intermediate - age carbon stars ; these stars formed in a burst of star formation that occurred within the last few gyrs ( e.g. , vega et al .",
    "2010 ) . in summary ,",
    "if the circumstellar envelopes of agb stars are the main source of mid - ir emission in galaxies , the mid - ir emission is sensitive to star formation over relatively long ( @xmath11 1 gyr ) timescales compared to spectroscopic star formation indicators such as nebular emission lines or balmer absorption lines ( piovan et al .",
    "2003 ; salim et al .",
    "2009 ; kelson & holden 2010 ; donoso et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "around 1 gyr after a single - burst of star formation , massive stars ( o , b , and a stars ) will be expired .",
    "the near - uv flux or h@xmath12 line index then is no longer a good tracer of star formation history in galaxies .",
    "however , the mid - ir emission can trace star formation over much longer timescales because low to intermediate mass ( 1 @xmath4 9 m@xmath13 ) stars evolve to the agb phase , and their circumstellar dust emission is strong in the mid - ir . therefore , the near - uv continuum and the mid - ir emission are complementary each other , and can provide a complete view of recent star formation history of galaxies .    in this paper , we study the various types of galaxies on the red sequence ( i.e. , optically quiescent without ongoing star formation ) using near - uv and mid - ir data to understand the possible connection between them .",
    "section 2 describes the observational data we use .",
    "we examine the near - uv and mid - ir properties of quiescent red - sequence galaxies in section 3 , and conclude in section 4 . throughout , we use the ab magnitude system , and adopt flat @xmath14cdm cosmological parameters : @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we used a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in the sdss data release 7 ( sdss dr7 , abazajian et al .",

    "galex _ data for these sdss galaxies from the _ galex _ gr6 that provides the cross - matched table ( * xsdssdr7 * ) against the sdss dr7 .",
    "the matching tolerance is 5(@xmath9fwhm of the _ galex _ psf ) . to avoid the contamination by nearby sources within the matching tolerance",
    ", we selected only unique matches : for a given sdss galaxy , we choose one _ galex _ object that is the closest to the sdss object and vice versa .",
    "we used only the sources covered by the medium imaging survey ( mis ) with a limiting magnitude of 22.7 ( mag in ab ) in the near - uv ( morrissey et al . 2005 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the redshift distribution of the sdss galaxies covered by _",

    "roughly 5% of the sdss galaxies do not have _ galex _ counterparts ; these galaxies seem faint in the near - uv , and their nuv@xmath19 colors are very red",
    ". some of them might be because of dust extinction and/or higher disk inclination .",
    "to minimize the impact of those galaxies , we exclude galaxies with lower axis ratio ( i.e. , @xmath20 less than 0.6 ) in the following analysis .",
    "we used the mid - ir data obtained by the _ wise _ satellite , which covers all the sky at four mid - ir bands ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the _ wise _ all - sky source catalog contains photometric data for over 563 million objects .",

    "if we consider bright ( @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath421.5 ) early - type galaxies , the fraction is down to 14% .",
    "most near - uv excess galaxies also show mid - ir excess emission , but some mid - ir excess galaxies do not show near - uv excess .",
    "this is consistent with that the mid - ir light is sensitive to star formation over longer time scales ( i.e. , recent star formation within @xmath92 gyr ) than the near - uv light .",
    "if we consider bright early - type galaxies , the fraction of quiescent red - sequence galaxies with recent star formation is 39% .",
    "this suggests that the recent star formation is common among nearby , quiescent , red , early - type galaxies .    the near - uv and mid - ir excess galaxies ( i.e. , early - type galaxies with recent star formation ) are optically fainter ( or less massive ) than galaxies without near - uv and mid - ir excess ( i.e. , early - type galaxies without near - uv and mid - ir excess emission ) .",
    "the mid - ir weighted mean stellar age and @xmath54000 indicate that the near - uv and mid - ir excess galaxies are also slightly younger than galaxies without near - uv and mid - ir excess .",
    "this can suggest an evolutionary scenario of quiescent red - sequence galaxies : those with near - uv excess @xmath53 those with mid - ir excess @xmath53 those without near - uv and mid - ir excess .",
    "the near - uv and mid - ir excess galaxies show different environmental dependence ; near - uv excess galaxies are preferentially found in low - density regions , but mid - ir excess galaxies are found in high density regions .",
    "this suggests strong environmental effects on the evolution of quiescent red - sequence galaxies with recent star formation .",
    "this study provides useful observational constraints on the theoretical models about the agb stars and their contribution to the mid - ir fluxes in galaxies .",
    "however , we do not quantify the amount of mid - ir emission attributed to agb dust in galaxies , and do assume that the contribution from other mechanisms for mid - ir emission ( e.g. , low - level of dusty starburst , agns ) is small .",
    "these will be examined in a forthcoming paper .",
