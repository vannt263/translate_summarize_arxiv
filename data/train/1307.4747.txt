    "loop quantum gravity and its covariant version - spin - foam models - are promising candidates for a quantum theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "recent development has shown that within the spin - foam models the eprl method of calculating the vertex amplitude @xcite are a way to recover the simplicity constraints of general relativity in the classical limit @xcite .",
    "there are two main classes of the eprl model : the euclidean eprl @xcite - with the @xmath3 group as a gauge group of the theory , and the lorentzian eprl @xcite - with the universal covering group of @xmath4 , namely @xmath5 , as a gauge group . in both versions of the model the key role is played by so called eprl map being the map @xmath6 where @xmath1 are the spinlabels of representations of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the hilbert space , on which this representation acts , while @xmath9 are the unitary representations of the group @xmath10 ( being either @xmath3 or @xmath5 ) and @xmath11 is the representation space respectively . in the euclidean case",
    "the @xmath12 map is given by certain combinations of clebsh - gordon coefficients , and the @xmath3 representations can be expressed in terms of wigner matrices , whose properties are well known .",
    "these makes the calculations relatively simple and several examples has been studied in detail .",
    "calculations in lorentzian case however involve matrix elements of unitary @xmath5 representations , being combinations of hypergeometric functions @xcite , what increase a lot difficulty of getting a precise result .",
    "nevertheless some attempts has been done in the lorentzian model as well . in the dipole cosmology model ( dc )",
    "@xcite the transition amplitude is written explicitly @xmath13 the integral does not have to be known explicitly , the only thing authors need is that it is bound by @xmath14 for large @xmath15 .",
    "such behaviour of this integral is assumed per analogy to the euclidean case @xcite , however it was not proven rigorously .",
    "the same integral can be found in the calculation of radiative correction to the spin - foam edge ( also called the  self energy  of the edge ) coming from the  melonic ",
    "diagram @xcite . in this paper",
    "it was shown , that the divergent part coming from a certain bubble is @xmath16 here however the operator @xmath2 appear in more general form , since there are no assumptions on the external spins of the bubble .",
    "thou detailed study of the operator @xmath2 gives an insight to behaviour of the divergences appearing in the spin - foam models .",
    "finally the the framework of the graph diagrams @xcite allowed to introduce the simple feynman - like rules to find the expressions on the spin - foam amplitudes ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these rules show clearly , that objects @xmath17 are the main building blocks of amplitude of each diagram ( spin - foam ) .",
    "thus understanding of them is needed , and the operator @xmath0 is the first step in this study .",
    "that s why we decided to investigate some basic properties of the @xmath2 operator .",
    "the paper is divided into two parts : the main text and the technical appendix . in the main text the in",
    "there is a strict definition of the object we study .",
    "contains some remarks on the saddle point approximation method of integration and points out the issues one has to check to use it in calculating the lorentzian polyhedra propagator .",
    "is the study of the function we integrate to obtain the propagator , however to make the text easy to read some parts of the calculations ( which are conceptually simple , but technically complicated ) are moved to appendixes . in we gather the results and point out some possible applications , and in we briefly conclude .",
    "there are three appendixes : [ sec : apphypergeometric ] is a collection of useful properties of gauss hypergeometric function @xmath18 , which is the main character of the calculations ; in [ sec : appspin ] we present some properties of the @xmath7-invariant tensors , and in [ sec : appproofs ] we prove some more technical lemmas .",
    "to make the paper self - contained , let us fix notation and definitions and recall some mathematical facts .",
    "* the @xmath7-elements will be denoted usually by @xmath19 , the @xmath5-elements will be denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "* by @xmath8 we will denote the representation space of @xmath7 of spin @xmath1 .",
    "for the basis elements of @xmath8 we will use the bra - ket notation : @xmath21 .",
    "the basis elements of tensor product @xmath22 are denoted by @xmath23 , or shortly by @xmath24 * the representation spaces of primary series of @xmath5 we will denote by @xmath25 , and its basis elements in bra - ket notation are @xmath26 . * the wigner matrices will be denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "the matrix elements of the primary series of @xmath5 representations are @xmath28 . *",
    "the eprl map @xmath12 is an injection of @xmath8 into @xmath29 given by @xmath30 ( see @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "it is obvious to generalise the eprl map to tensor products of @xmath8 spaces : @xmath31 . *",
    "the choice of the basis in @xmath32 picks a normal subgroup @xmath33 such that given @xmath34 the matrix elements are @xmath35 ( in other words @xmath36 commutes with @xmath12 ) .",
    "this subgroup defines a decomposition of @xmath5 into @xmath37 ( and @xmath38 ) where @xmath39 is a 3-hyperboloid , which can be parametrised by @xmath40 .",
    "having defined above , we can proceed to the lorentzian polyhedra propagator .",
    "given a set of spinlabels @xmath41 let us define an operator @xmath2 acting on @xmath42 by the formula @xmath43    the matrix elements of @xmath2 in the spin-@xmath44 basis can be expressed as @xmath45    let us now study some basic properties of @xmath2 .",
    "since each @xmath5 element @xmath20 can be decomposed into @xmath46 where @xmath34 and @xmath47 , the @xmath2 operator can be written as @xmath48 but since the @xmath7 elements commute with @xmath12 : @xmath49 now note , that @xmath50 is the projection onto the @xmath7-invariant subspace of the space we are acting on - in this case it is @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath52 where @xmath53 is some operator",
    ".    we can do the same decomposition on the left - hand side : @xmath54 thus @xmath55    so @xmath2 acts nontrivially only on @xmath56 .",
    "let us now choose an orthonormal basis @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 and @xmath59 be the basis elements .",
    "it is enough to investigate the matrix elements of @xmath2 @xmath60 what we shell do in what follows .",
    "the vector fields on @xmath5 are spanned by three @xmath7 rotation generators @xmath61 and three boost generators @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63 component of the decomposition @xmath46 can be written as @xmath64 .",
    "for each vector @xmath65 ( of length @xmath66 ) exists an @xmath7 element @xmath67 such that @xmath68 , and thou @xmath69 thus each @xmath70 can be expressed as @xmath71    let us now investigate , how does @xmath72 depend on @xmath36 and @xmath65 .",
    "using the fact , that @xmath7-elements commute with the eprl map @xmath12 it is straightforward to see that @xmath73 but since @xmath74 is an @xmath7-invariant , we have @xmath75and thus @xmath76 so the integrand is @xmath7 invariant .      now using lets investigate @xmath77 : @xmath78 again using @xmath7 invariance of @xmath79 and @xmath74 we get @xmath80",
    "thus the integrand depends only on the length of the boost vector @xmath81 .",
    "thanks the @xmath7-symmetry presented above we can trivially do the @xmath7-integral , ( which gives identity , thanks to normalisation of the haar measure ) and we are left with the integral @xmath82 according to @xcite the measure @xmath83 is @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the spherical angles of the boost direction .",
    "let us now introduce the measure function @xmath87 now obviously @xmath88 and this is the measure we will use in further calculations , i.e. we will calculate @xmath89 .",
    "to calculate the @xmath2 operator one have to do the integral over @xmath5 group",
    ". we will not do this integral explicitly , we will find its leading order using the saddle point approximation ( spa ) method @xcite .",
    "the spa allows to express integrals of the form @xmath90 for large values of @xmath91 as a power series in @xmath92 .",
    "the leading order of the integral is determined by the value of integrand in the critical point @xmath93 of the function @xmath94 : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the determinant of the hessian matrix of the function @xmath94 . if the function @xmath97 has more than one critical point @xmath98 , than the argument @xmath93 that appear in the formula is _ the maximal critical point _ : such a point @xmath99 that @xmath100 is maximal ( if there is more then one maximal critical point , than sum over them ) .",
    "several assumptions must be satisfied for the formula to be valid .",
    "first of all the function @xmath94 must be smooth and twice differentiable at the point @xmath93 .",
    "moreover the integrand @xmath101 must vanish outside a compact region @xmath102 ( or decay sufficiently fast with @xmath103  see ) .",
    "these properties of our integrand @xmath72 will be checked in .",
    "the euclidean eprl transition amplitude can be easily expressed in the form of @xmath104 @xcite . in the lorentzian case , which we consider now",
    ", the decomposition of the integrand is not obvious .",
    "however one can still use the spa method for the integrand of the form @xmath105 defined on @xmath106 , if it has a proper large-@xmath91 behaviour and if one can identify the critical points of the exponent part of the integrand @xcite .    given a function @xmath105",
    "let us define the _ exponent part of the integrand : _ @xmath107 the function @xmath108 may diverge for some points @xmath109 .",
    "if the points , where it diverges , form a region - it means , that the parameter @xmath91 is not a good largeness parameter , i.e. the exponent grows faster then linear in @xmath91 . in such case",
    "one should consider another parameter @xmath110 instead ( this is for example the case when integrating @xmath111 - the proper largeness parameter is @xmath112 not @xmath113 ) .",
    "a similar situation is when the limit is identically zero - then the exponent grows slower then linearly in @xmath91 ( for example @xmath114 ) .",
    "if the largeness parameter @xmath91 was chosen properly , we obtain a nontrivial function @xmath108 ( which of course may have some poles or zero points ) .",
    "the potentially critical points are the critical points of @xmath115 and the poles of @xmath115 .",
    "the poles represent the situation when @xmath116 . in this case value of @xmath108",
    "does not capture behaviour of @xmath97 , hence one need to consider instead @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the lowest order of differentiation , for which the limit converges , and @xmath119 .",
    "now let us define the family of sets of poles @xmath120 ( with @xmath121 ) and a family of sets of critical points @xmath122 ( with @xmath123 ) .",
    "the set of critical points of the exponent is @xmath124 .    for each critical point @xmath125 let us define the real part of the exponent as @xmath126",
    "now the maximal critical point @xmath127 is the one , for which @xmath128 is maximal .",
    "so at the end of the day the integral equals @xmath129 where @xmath118 is such that @xmath130 .",
    "consider a spherically symmetric integrand @xmath131 , for @xmath132 , with the maximal critical point at @xmath133 ( being in the interior of the region @xmath134 ) .",
    "then the hessian matrix of the function @xmath115 is @xmath135 since @xmath133 is the critical point , the differential @xmath136 , thus the first term vanish .",
    "further simplification comes from the fact , that @xmath137 and since @xmath138 , we have @xmath139 thus the hessian matrix is @xmath140 and the hessian determinant @xmath141      the spa method is well defined if the region of integration @xmath134 is compact and the integrand vanish at @xmath142 .",
    "however under certain assumptions one can generalise the spa to the case of noncompact integration range .",
    "assume that exists @xmath143 such that for all @xmath144 the following is true : for each @xmath145 exists a compact region @xmath146 , such that @xmath147 and that @xmath148 for @xmath149 .",
    "then let us introduce for each @xmath150 another compact region @xmath151 , such that @xmath152 and a smooth function @xmath153 such that @xmath154 obviously @xmath155 .",
    "now let @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "obviously for all @xmath144 we have @xmath158 , thus function @xmath159 converges to @xmath160 uniformly with respect to @xmath91 .",
    "but each integral @xmath159 is in fact integral over a compact region @xmath151 , so it can be calculated using the spa method : @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the maximal critical point of @xmath115 in the region @xmath163 . for @xmath150",
    "sufficiently small , for example for @xmath164 , the region @xmath163 must contain the maximal critical point of @xmath115 , so @xmath165 , thus the leading term does not depend on @xmath150 .",
    "so the leading term of the function @xmath160 is the limit at @xmath166 of the leading terms of @xmath159 .",
    "consider now integral of the form @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a nonvanishing function .",
    "when using the spa method , the integral @xmath169 can be easily related to @xmath170 .",
    "indeed , note , that presence of @xmath168 does not effect the exponent part of the integrand : @xmath171 thus the maximal critical points of the exponent of the integrand does not know about presence of @xmath168 . so using spa method",
    "we get @xmath172",
    "let us now investigate the properties of the integrand .",
    "recalling the integrand is @xmath173 with @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "our largeness parameter is @xmath176 .",
    "obviously the function @xmath177 does not depend on the largeness parameter .",
    "thus , using , it is enough to find the critical points of @xmath178 . from now on we will call the function @xmath179 the _ full integrand _ , the function @xmath178 the _ integrand _ , and the function @xmath177 the _ measure part of the integrand _ or simply the _ measure_.    in this section we will often go back to the @xmath21 basis , so that @xmath180 where @xmath181 since @xmath182=0 $ ] , each term is proportional to @xmath183 , and thus we can define the function @xmath184 such that @xmath185 thanks to it is now obvious , that in the basis @xmath24 all the nondiagonal matrix elements are precisely zero ( without any approximation ) .",

    "obviously @xmath191 , but one can not treat them as the small parameters .",

    "for @xmath285 the exponent is zero , which means , that the divergence is @xmath286 .",
    "our calculation shows , that in large @xmath202 limit ( with @xmath202 being the maximal external spin of the external faces of the bubble ) up to @xmath248 corrections this radiative - corrected edge operator is proportional to the identity with the constant dependent on @xmath91 and @xmath202 : @xmath287^{3}\\delta_{\\iota,\\iota'}\\label{eq : radiativefinall}\\ ] ] the factor in front of the delta we will call @xmath288 : @xmath289^{3}\\label{eq : ajl}\\ ] ] we will use it in the next subsection in the edge - renormalization problem .",
