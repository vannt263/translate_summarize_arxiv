    "quantum field theory is one of the most powerful methods of contemporary physics .",
    "it exhibits exciting analytical and combinatorial problems that are tightly intermingled .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop an algebraic framework which simplifies the solution of its combinatorial problems .",
    "this framework encompasses the main concepts used in the practical calculation of observable quantities : normal products , time - ordered products and renormalisation . with these three tools",
    ", one can calculate the s - matrix and the green functions , i.e. about everything that can be compared with experiments .",
    "the analytical difficulties will be avoided by working in a finite - dimensional vector space instead of with field operators ( i.e. operator - valued distributions @xcite ) .",
    "the algebraic framework is an extension of the `` laplace hopf algebras '' created and elaborated by rota and coll .",
    "@xcite . a laplace hopf algebra is a hopf algebra equipped with a bilinear form called the `` laplace pairing '' . with this algebra , rota and coll . were able to transform intricate combinatorial problems into clear algebraic manipulations @xcite .    in quantum field theory ,",
    "the commutator of two field operators is not an operator but a scalar function .",
    "therefore , all products of field operators can be written as a linear combination of symmetric ( i.e. normal ) products of operators .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the vector space spanned by all normal products of operators .",
    "similarly , the difference between the time - ordered product of two operators and the normal product of these operators is a scalar function .",
    "thus , all time - ordered products of operators belong also to @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "quantum field theory can be entirely discussed in the space @xmath0 of normal products .",
    "working in @xmath0 has several advantages , already noted by houriet and kind @xcite , and later stressed by wick @xcite and by gupta @xcite : @xmath0 is equipped with a commutative product ( the symmetric product ) and the expectation value of an element @xmath1 of @xmath0 over the vacuum is zero if @xmath1 has no scalar component .",
    "fauser discovered recently @xcite that the time - ordered product is an instance of the `` circle product '' , which is a deformation of the symmetric product of @xmath0 constructed from the laplace pairing .",
    "in particular , wick s theorem becomes a very simple algebraic expression .",
    "moreover , we prove that the operator product is also an instance of the circle product derived from a different laplace pairing .",
    "thus , the bare quantities of quantum field theory can be obtained from circle products",
    ". however , renormalisation does not fit into rota and stein s original framework .",
    "renormalisation was created in 1949 by dyson @xcite , and its algebraic meaning remained mysterious until kreimer discovered that it is ruled by a hopf algebra @xcite .",
    "renormalisation was then refined by connes and kreimer @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to see renormalisation . in the standard approach",
    ", an analytic expression is renormalised by adding counterterms to the lagrangian .",
    "epstein and glaser proposed an alternative point of view , where renormalisation is seen as a modification of the time - ordered product @xcite .",
    "this approach was elaborated into its most powerful form by pinter @xcite .",
    "it turns out that her work can be used to define a deformation of the circle product through a modified laplace pairing , which satisfies axioms weaker than those of rota s laplace pairing , but enables us to define an associative product , the renormalised circle product .",
    "this deformation depends on an infinite number of free parameters . for a certain choice of the bilinear form ,",
    "the renormalised circle product is identical with the renormalised t - product .",
    "we call _ quantum field algebra _ the symmetric hopf algebra @xmath0 equipped with a laplace pairing and the group of renormalisation parameters .",
    "this name seems appropriate because such a structure enables us to define all the quantities that can be calculated from quantum field theory and compared with experiment .",
    "the purpose of this paper is threefold : ( i ) to define an algebraic framework which simplifies the combinatorics of quantum field theory , ( ii ) to extend rota s laplace pairing so that more general combinatorial problems can be solved , ( iii ) to extract as much algebra as possible from the quantum field formalism , so that algebraists can contribute to quantum field theory without having to read physics textbooks .    in the next section ,",
    "we define the laplace hopf algebra and the circle product , we prove that the circle product is associative and that , for a symmetric laplace pairing , the circle product reproduces the time - ordered product and satisfies wick s theorem .",
    "then , we introduce the renormalised circle product , we prove that it is associative and we show that it reproduces the renormalised time - ordered product .",
    "then we give some algebraic properties of the bare and renormalised time - ordered products .",
    "finally , we describe further connections between our algebraic approach and quantum field theory .",
    "an appendix gathers the basic concepts of hopf algebras .    in this article we concentrate on the presentation of the formalism and we give several proofs in full detail , to show how straightforward they become in the new algebraic framework . to make things as simple as possible we treat here scalar bosons fields , but the extension to fermions is possible",
    "as pointed out by fauser @xcite , wick s theorem is related to a mathematical structure discovered by rota and stein and called a laplace hopf algebra @xcite .",
    "thus , our first step will be to give a definition and a few properties of laplace hopf algebras .",
    "the readers who are not familiar with hopf algebras should first read the appendix .",
    "since we are working with bosons , our starting point will be the symmetric algebra .",
    "later , the symmetric product will designate the normal product of bosonic creation and annihilation operators ( see section [ normalprodsect ] ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be a finite dimensional vector space , with basis @xmath3 .",
    "we define the symmetric algebra @xmath0 as the direct sum @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is spanned by elements of the form @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "the symbol @xmath10 denotes the associative and commutative product @xmath11 defined on elements of the basis of @xmath2 by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the permutation on @xmath14 elements such that @xmath15 , and then extended by linearity and associativity to all elements of @xmath0 .",
    "the unit of @xmath0 is the scalar unit @xmath16 ( i.e. for any @xmath17 : @xmath18 ) .",
    "moreover , this algebra is graded : if @xmath19 then we say that its grading is @xmath20 .",
    "the symmetric product is a graded map : if @xmath21 and @xmath22 then @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 can be seen as the algebra of polynomials in the variables @xmath3 , the elements of @xmath7 being homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath24 .    in this paper , @xmath1 , @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath26 designate elements of @xmath0 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 designate elements of @xmath2 and @xmath31 are elements of a basis of @xmath2 .",
    "we define a coproduct over @xmath0 as follows @xmath32 where sweedler s notation was used for the coproduct of @xmath1 and @xmath25 : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this coproduct is coassociative and cocommutative .",
    "it is equivalent to the coproduct defined by pinter ( equation ( 5 ) of reference @xcite ) . as an example , we calculate the coproduct @xmath35 , where @xmath27 and @xmath29 are in @xmath2 . from equation ( [ deltau ] ) @xmath36 from the definition ( [ deltaa ] ) of the coproduct acting on elements of @xmath2 we know that @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , @xmath39 at the next order , we have @xmath40    generally , if @xmath41 , the coproduct of @xmath1 can be written explicitly as ( @xcite p.450 ) @xmath42 where @xmath13 runs over the @xmath43-shuffles .",
    "a @xmath43-shuffle is a permutation @xmath13 of @xmath44 such that @xmath45    the counit is defined by @xmath46 and @xmath47 if @xmath19 and @xmath48 .",
    "the antipode is defined by @xmath49 if @xmath19 . in particular , @xmath50 .",
    "since the symmetric product is commutative , the antipode is an algebra morphism : @xmath51 .",
    "the fact that this coproduct is coassociative and that @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 give @xmath0 the structure of a cocommutative hopf algebra is a classical result ( @xcite p.450 and references therein ) .",
    "this algebra is called the symmetric hopf algebra .",
    "we define a _ laplace pairing _ on @xmath0 as a bilinear form @xmath55 , that we denote by @xmath56 , and which is extended to @xmath0 by the following recursions @xmath57 it is important to stress that we do not assume any special symmetry for the bilinear form ( i.e. it is a priori neither symmetric nor antisymmetric ) .",
    "the pairing defined by rota and coll . in @xcite is more general , but for quantum field theory our restricted definition is sufficient .",
    "the name `` laplace pairing '' comes from the fact that equations ( [ laplaceid1 ] ) and ( [ laplaceid2 ] ) are an elegant way of writing the laplace identities for determinants ( in the case of fermion operators ) .",
    "these identities express the determinant in terms of minors ( see ref.@xcite p.26 and ref.@xcite p.93 ) .",
    "they were derived by laplace in 1772 @xcite .    in reference",
    "@xcite , it is proved that these recursions have the following unique solution : if @xmath58 and @xmath59 , then @xmath60 if @xmath61 and @xmath62 if @xmath63 .",
    "we recall that the _ permanent _ of the matrix @xmath64 is @xmath65 where the sum is over all permutations @xmath13 of @xmath66 .",
    "the permanent is a kind of determinant where all signs are positive .",
    "for instance @xmath67    in this paper , a _",
    "laplace hopf algebra _ is the symmetric hopf algebra equipped with a laplace pairing .",
    "this section introduces the circle product .",
    "its importance stems form the fact that the circle product treats in one single stroke the operator product and the time - ordered product , according to the definition of the bilinear form @xmath56 .",
    "following @xcite , the _ circle product _ is the operation on @xmath0 defined by , @xmath68 and @xmath69 in their equation ( c ) ) .",
    "thus , the present circle product is not strictly a particular case of rota and stein s .",
    "however , the main properties of their circle product remain true with a scalar pairing . ]",
    "@xmath70 by cocommutativity of the coproduct on @xmath0 , this definition is equivalent to @xmath71    a few examples might be useful @xmath72 we shall need some simple properties of the circle product @xmath73    as an exercise , we prove that @xmath74 we apply the counit @xmath53 to definition ( [ defcircle ] ) of the circle product : @xmath75 the counit is an algebra morphism , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "thus , by linearity of the laplace pairing , @xmath77 but the counit property is precisely the identity @xmath78 .",
    "this proves equation ( [ circepsilon ] ) .    in the next section",
    ", we prove that the circle product is associative : @xmath79 .",
    "we give a detailed proof of the associativity of the circle product , because it is an important result ( and because neither fauser nor rota and stein provided it ) .",
    "we first need a useful lemma : @xmath80 the proof is easy , we start from the definition of the circle product ( [ defcircle ] ) to write @xmath81 now we use the definition ( [ deltau ] ) of the coproduct of @xmath82 : @xmath83 the coassociativity of the coproduct of @xmath1 means that any triple @xmath84 can be replaced by @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 we use now the coassociativity of the coproduct of @xmath25 @xmath87 and the definition of the circle product brings @xmath88 to obtain the other identity of the lemma , we start from @xmath89 or we use the cocommutativity of the coproduct .    the second lemma is @xmath90 the proof is straightforward @xmath91 the first line is the definition of the circle product ( [ defcircle ] ) , the second line is the expansion of the laplace pairing ( [ laplaceid2 ] ) , the third one is the laplace identity ( [ laplaceid1 ] ) and the last equality is again equation ( [ defcircle ] ) .",
    "the associativity of the circle product follows immediately from these two lemmas . from definition ( [ defcircle ] ) and the first lemma we obtain @xmath92 from the associativity of the symmetric product and the second lemma we obtain @xmath93 now the first lemma enables us to rewrite this as @xmath94    in comparison with the standard proofs of quantum field theory ,",
    "the combinatorial derivations have been replaced by purely algebraic ones .",
    "this is the great advantage of the hopf algebraic approach to combinatorics advocated by rota .      in reference",
    "@xcite , rota and stein use the antipode of the symmetric hopf algebra to write the symmetric product in terms of the circle product .",
    "the same holds in our case : @xmath95 the proof is simple : @xmath96 the last line was obtained because , from equation ( [ circepsilon ] ) , @xmath97 . as for @xcite , it is also possible to recover the laplace pairing from the circle product : @xmath98 again , the proof is straightforward : @xmath99 rota and stein @xcite also provide a sort of distributivity formula for circle and symmetric products , which still holds : @xmath100 for this result we need the following lemma @xmath101 which is proved easily @xmath102 now , we can prove ( [ distributivity ] ) .",
    "@xmath103 where the last line was obtained using the previous lemma .",
    "now we rewrite the last line as @xmath104      in this section , we show that the circle product satisfies a generalized version of wick s theorem .",
    "this result is important because it will be used to show that , according to the choice of the bilinear form @xmath56 , the circle product is identical with the time - ordered product or with the operator product .",
    "there are two wick s theorems , one for operator products and one for time - ordered products @xcite , but they have an identical structure .",
    "wick s theorem is very well known , so we recall it briefly .",
    "it states that the time - ordered ( resp .",
    "operator ) product of a given number of elements of @xmath2 is equal to the sum over all possible pairs of contractions ( resp .",
    "pairings ) .",
    "the reader who is not familiar with wick s theorem will be referred to standard references ( e.g. @xcite p.209 , @xcite p.261 , @xcite p.85 ) .",
    "a contraction @xmath105 is the difference between the time - ordered product and the normal product . in wick",
    "s notation @xcite @xmath106 .",
    "a pairing @xmath107 is the difference between the operator product and the normal product : @xmath108 .",
    "this pairing was used by houriet and kind even before wick s article @xcite .",
    "both the contraction and the pairing are scalars . to express these in our notation",
    ", we identify the normal product @xmath109 with the symmetric product @xmath110 .",
    "this is valid because the normal product has all the properties required for a symmetric product ( see section [ normalprodsect ] ) .    on the one hand ,",
    "the time - ordered product is symmetric , and @xmath105 is a symmetric bilinear form that we can identify with our @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the time - ordered product of two operators is equal to the circle product obtained from this symmetric bilinear form .",
    "on the other hand , the pairing defined from the operator product is an antisymmetric bilinear form : @xmath111 , that we can also identify with our @xmath56 ( not the same as in the previous paragraph , of course ) .",
    "the operator product of two elements of @xmath2 is now equal to the circle product obtained from this antisymmetric bilinear form .",
    "therefore , we have identified the symmetric products with the normal products and we have shown that the circle product can reproduce the time - ordered product and the operator product of two elements of @xmath2 . to prove that the equality remains true for the product of more than two elements of @xmath2 , we shall show that the circle product satisfies wick s theorem .",
    "we recall that the main ingredient used by wick @xcite to go from a product of @xmath24 elements of @xmath2 to a product of @xmath112 elements of @xmath2 is the following recursive identity @xmath113 this identity , the properties of the normal ( i.e. symmetric ) product and the definition of the contraction ( or pairing ) of two operators were sufficient for wick to prove his theorem .",
    "thus , we must show that the above identity is valid for the circle product . in our notation ,",
    "( defining @xmath114 ) we must prove @xmath115 to show this , we use the definition ( [ defcircle ] ) of the circle product and equation ( [ deltaa ] ) to find @xmath116 the laplace pairing @xmath117 is zero if the grading of @xmath118 is different from 1 . in other words , @xmath118 must be an element of @xmath2 . according to the general equation ( [ shuffle ] ) for @xmath119",
    ", this happens only for the @xmath120-shuffles . by definition ,",
    "a @xmath120-shuffle is a permutation @xmath13 of @xmath44 such that @xmath121 , and the corresponding terms in the coproduct of @xmath119 are @xmath122 this proves the required identity , and we have shown that the circle product satisfies wick s theorem .    our proof of wick s theorem for the circle product did not use any symmetry of the bilinear form .",
    "thus it is more general than the usual wick s theorem .",
    "if the bilinear form is half of the commutator , as in houriet and kind s article @xcite , then we obtain wick s theorem for operator products ( @xcite p.212 ) and the circle product is equal to the operator product . if the bilinear form is the feynman propagator , as in wick s article @xcite , then we obtain wick s theorem for time - ordered products ( @xcite p.215 ) and the circle product is equal to the time - ordered product . the fact that the commutator and the feynman propagator are sufficient to determine",
    "the operator and time - ordered products was noticed by fauser for the case of fermion operators @xcite .",
    "in this section , we introduce the renormalised circle product that we write @xmath123 . in a finite dimensional vector space",
    ", the purpose of renormalisation is no longer to remove infinities , since everything is finite , but to provide a deformation of the circle product involving an infinite number of parameters .",
    "the physical meaning of these renormalisation parameters is the following : time ordering of operators is clear when two operators are defined at different times .",
    "however , the meaning of the time - ordering of two operators taken at the same time is ambiguous .",
    "renormalisation is here to parametrise this ambiguity .",
    "the renormalised circle product will be defined in several steps .",
    "we first need the renormalisation parameters .",
    "they are defined as a linear map @xmath124 from @xmath0 to @xmath125 , such that @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "these parameters form a group : the renormalisation group .",
    "the group product @xmath129 is defined by @xmath130 this product is called the convolution of the hopf algebra .",
    "the coassociativity and cocommutativity of the hopf algebra implies that the product @xmath129 is associative and commutative .",
    "the unit of the group is the counit @xmath53 of the hopf algebra .",
    "the inverse of @xmath124 is @xmath131 , defined by @xmath132 or , recursively , by @xmath133 where @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "for instance , @xmath136      from the renormalisation parameters , we can define a pairing that we call a z - pairing @xmath137 a few examples and properties might be useful @xmath138    the main property of the z - pairing is the coupling identity @xmath139 for instance , the reader can check this identity for the case @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 : @xmath143    to show equation ( [ zcouplingid ] ) , we first need an easy lemma @xmath144 we first use the definition of @xmath145 , then the cocommutativity of @xmath146 and @xmath147 , then the coassociativity of @xmath1 and @xmath25 , then the definition of @xmath148 , and finally the definition of the counit : @xmath149 to prove the coupling identity , we expand the z - pairing in terms of the renormalisation parameters @xmath150 now we use the cocommutativity of the coproduct of @xmath118 and @xmath151 and the coassociativity of the coproduct of @xmath1 and @xmath25 : @xmath152 now we use the easy lemma to eliminate @xmath153 and the cocommutativity of the coproduct of @xmath26 and we obtain @xmath154 the right hand side of this equation is fully summetric in @xmath1 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , all permutations of @xmath1 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the left hand side give the same result .",
    "in particular , the permutation @xmath155 and the symmetry of @xmath156 transform the left hand side of equation ( [ zcouplingid ] ) into its right hand side , which proves equation ( [ zcouplingid ] ) .",
    "the reader can check that the laplace pairing also satisfies the coupling identity : @xmath157    for the renormalisation theory , it would be interesting to know the most general solution of the coupling identity . more precisely , if @xmath158 is a bilinear map from @xmath159 to @xmath125 such that equation ( [ zcouplingid ] ) is satisfied , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , what is the most general form of @xmath158 ?      from the z - pairing , we can define the modified laplace pairing as @xmath162 a few examples and properties might be appropriate @xmath163    the modified laplace pairing satisfies also the coupling identity @xmath164    we show this by expanding the definition of the modified laplace pairing @xmath165 we use the definition of @xmath166 @xmath167 now the same operations are done starting from @xmath168 .",
    "we must only do the permutation @xmath155 and put @xmath1 on the left when @xmath26 was on the right .",
    "this leads us to @xmath169 the right hand side of this equation is related to the last form of y by the coupling identities for the z - pairing and the laplace pairing .",
    "thus they are identical and the proof of equation ( [ mlcouplingid ] ) is complete .",
    "after these preliminaries , we can now define the renormalised circle product @xmath170 a few examples and properties might again be useful @xmath171    the renormalised circle product is associative . to show that , we need the following identity @xmath172 which is derived exactly as equations ( [ deltacirc ] ) and ( [ deltacirc2 ] ) . therefore , using equation ( [ deltabarcirc ] ) and the cocommutativity and coassociativity of the coproduct , @xmath173 from the coupling identity ( [ mlcouplingid ] ) we obtain @xmath174 thus , the renormalised circle product is associative .",
    "this is the first main result of the paper .",
    "note that the action of the renormalisation group is not on the elements of the algebra but on the circle product .",
    "the laplace pairing and the renormalisation parameters provide a deformation of the symmetric product with an infinite number of parameters .",
    "now we shall define the t - product and the renormalised t - product , and we shall prove that the renormalised circle product reproduces the renormalised t - product of quantum field theory .",
    "in quantum field theory , the boson operators commute inside a t - product . thus , from now on , the circle product will be considered commutative .",
    "we first show that this is equivalent to @xmath175 for all @xmath176 .",
    "the corresponding result for clifford algebras was obtained by fauser @xcite .",
    "if the circle product is commutative , then in particular @xmath177 , so that @xmath175 .",
    "inversely , if @xmath175 for all @xmath176 , then @xmath178 for all @xmath179 .",
    "the first step is to show that , if @xmath175 for all @xmath176 , then @xmath180 for all @xmath179 . but this follows immediately from the definition ( [ permanent ] ) of the permanent . because of the commutativity of the symmetric product we obtain @xmath181      we define recursively a linear map @xmath182 from @xmath0 to @xmath0 by @xmath183 , @xmath184 for @xmath27 in @xmath2 and @xmath185 .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath186 .",
    "the circle product is associative and ( in this section ) commutative , therefore @xmath182 is well defined .",
    "this t - map is the usual t - product of quantum field theory .",

    "the symmetric identity in equation ( [ deltat ] ) is obtained by cocommutativity of the coproduct .",
    "now , we shall derive a result obtained by anderson @xcite and rediscovered several times @xcite : the t - map can be written as the exponential of an operator @xmath193 . as an application of the laplace hopf algebra , we give a purely algebraic proof of this .",
    "first , we define a derivation @xmath194 attached to a basis @xmath195 of vector space @xmath2 .",
    "this derivation is defined as the linear operator on @xmath0 satisfying the following properties @xmath196 in the second equation , @xmath197 is 1 for @xmath198 and zero otherwise . the leibniz relation ( [ deriv2 ] )",

    ", it can be shown recursively that the derivatives commute : @xmath201 .",

    "since the circle product is assumed commutative , the renormalised circle product is also commutative , and the map @xmath245 is well defined on @xmath0 .    following the proof of equation ( [ deltat ] )",
    ", we can show that @xmath249    in this section we derive two renormalisation identities .",
    "these identities show that our renormalised t - map coincides with the renormalised t - product of quantum field theory , as formalized by pinter .",
    "the first identity is : @xmath250 this is proved as follows . by definition @xmath251 because of equation ( [ deltat ] ) , this becomes @xmath252 by definition of the modified laplace pairing , this can be rewritten @xmath253 and the results follows from the coassociativity of the coproduct and the definition of the circle product .",
    "now we show the following formula @xmath254 this is the second main result of the paper .",
    "equation ( [ pinter ] ) is pinter s indentity for the renormalisation of a @xmath226-product ( equation ( 17 ) in reference @xcite ) .",
    "it is a very general renormalisation formula .",
    "its importance stems from the fact that it is valid also for field theories that are only renormalisable through an infinite number of renormalisation parameters .",
    "its history starts with dyson and salam @xcite .",
    "a crypted version of it can be recognized with hindsight in bogoliubov s works @xcite .",
    "it finally appeared in full light in pinter s papers @xcite .",
    "note that formula ( [ pinter ] ) does not encompass the complete epstein - glaser renormalisation @xcite which completely avoids infinities .",
    "it only describes the transition from one renormalisation to another one .",
    "however , in the usual bphz renormalisation of quantum field theory , the removal of infinities is made by a formula which is equivalent to ( [ pinter ] ) .",
    "thus , equation ( [ pinter ] ) is the standard bphz renormalisation in the epstein - glaser guise .",
    "we are going to prove equation ( [ pinter ] ) recursively .",
    "it is true for @xmath188 or @xmath140 and @xmath189 or @xmath141 . now , suppose it holds for @xmath1 and @xmath25 , then by definition , and using the recursion hypothesis , @xmath255 equation ( [ bulltocirc ] ) gives us @xmath256 from the coassociativity of the coproduct and the definition ( [ zcouplingdef ] ) of the z - pairing we obtain @xmath257 this is the required identity for @xmath258 .",
    "the reasoning that lead to the scalar t - map can be followed exactly to define a scalar renormalised t - map as a linear map @xmath259 from @xmath0 to @xmath125 such that @xmath260 , @xmath261 for @xmath128 and @xmath262 then @xmath263 and @xmath264 moreover , equation ( [ pinter ] ) enables us to show that @xmath265 we give a few examples @xmath266    the scalar renormalised t - product corresponds to the numerical distributions of the causal approach @xcite .",
    "in this section , we make a closer connection between the hopf algebra approach and the usual quantum field formalism .      to define a normal product , we start from creation and annihilation operators @xmath267 and @xmath268 that are taken as the basis vectors of two vector spaces @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "these two bases are in involution , i.e. there is an operator @xmath271 such that @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "the creation operators commute and there is no other relation between them .",
    "thus , the hopf algebra of the creation operators is the symmetric algebra @xmath274 .",
    "similarly , the hopf algebra of the annihilation operators is @xmath275 . from @xmath269 and @xmath270",
    ", we define a vector space @xmath276 , so that each vector @xmath128 can be written @xmath277 and we call @xmath278 the projector from @xmath2 to @xmath269 and @xmath279 the projector from @xmath2 to @xmath270 . thus @xmath280 and @xmath281",
    ".    there is an isomorphism between @xmath0 , the symmetric algebra of @xmath2 and the tensor product of the symmetric algebras @xmath274 and @xmath275 .",
    "@xmath0 is the vector space of normal products .",
    "the isomorphism @xmath282 is defined by @xmath283 and we recover the fact that a normal product puts all annihilation operators on the right of all creation operators .",
    "this isomorphism and the projectors @xmath284 and @xmath285 can be defined recursively by @xmath286 the algebra @xmath0 is graded by the number of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "there is a subtelty here .",
    "it seems that we have forgotten the operator product of elements of @xmath269 with elements of @xmath287 .",
    "we have replaced @xmath288 by @xmath289 and we lost all information concerning the commutation of creation and annihilation operators . however , this is also true in standard quantum field theory .",
    "textbooks sometimes describe a kind of `` normal product operator '' which takes a product of operators and puts all creation operators on the left and all annihilation operators on the right .",
    "but such an operator would not be well - defined ( @xcite p.28 ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath290 and @xmath291 are equal as operators , but their normal products @xmath292 and @xmath291 are different .",
    "thus , it is not consistent to consider a normal product as obtained from the transformation of an operator product and we also loose all information concerning the commutation relations in standard quantum field theory .",
    "however , we saw that an antisymmetric laplace pairing enables us to build a circle product in @xmath0 which is an operator product . in that sense",
    "normal products are a basic concept and operator product a derived concept of quantum field theory . the problem of quantum field theory in curved space times has also revealed that normal products ( i.e. wick polynomials ) are fundamental elements of quantum field theory @xcite . therefore , from our point of view , quantum field theory starts from the space @xmath0 of normal products and the operator product and time - ordered products are obtained as deformations of the symmetric product .    in the quantum field theory of scalar particles ,",
    "our `` basis '' @xmath293 is not indexed by a finite number of @xmath220 but by a continuous set of @xmath294 . by an unfortunate convention ,",
    "the creation operators are @xmath295 and the annihilation operators are @xmath296 .",
    "thus , for instance , the basis vectors of @xmath297 are the operators @xmath295 where @xmath294 plays the role of the index of the basis vectors .",
    "this uncountable basis of @xmath297 is one of the sources of the analytical complexity of quantum field theory .",
    "for instance , these basic vectors enable us to define a bilinear form for the definition of operator products as ( @xcite p.117 ) @xmath298 and a bilinear form for the definition of time - ordered products as ( @xcite p.124 ) @xmath299 where , for massless bosons ( @xcite p.93 ) @xmath300 are distributions .",
    "the manipulation of these distributions creates many analytical problems that we do not want to address here .",
    "this is why we consider only finite - dimensional vector spaces in the present paper .",
    "the counit is a basic element of hopf algebras , and it has a particularly simple expression for quantum fields : it is the expectation value over the vacuum . in other words , for any element @xmath1 of @xmath0 ( i.e. for any sum of normal products of quantum fields ) the following striking identity holds : @xmath301 , where @xmath53 is the counit of the symmetric hopf algebra .",
    "this is very easy to show .",
    "firstly , @xmath302 is a linear map from @xmath0 to @xmath125 .",
    "secondly , for elements @xmath1 of @xmath7 with @xmath48 @xmath47 and @xmath303 because @xmath1 is a normal product . finally , the symmetric hopf algebra is connected , thus all elements of @xmath304 are multiple of the unit : for any @xmath305 there is a complex number @xmath306 such that @xmath307 .",
    "moreover , @xmath308 .",
    "thus @xmath309 . but",
    "the vacuum is assumed to be normalized , thus we have @xmath310 .",
    "thus the counit and the expectation value over the vacuum are identical .",
    "this identity is a additional argument in favor of the fact that hopf algebras are a natural framework for quantum field theory .      for any @xmath17 ( @xmath1 plays the role of a lagrangian ) we can define the normal ordered s - matrix @xmath311 by @xmath312 where @xmath313 and the symmetric power is defined recursively by @xmath314 , @xmath315 and @xmath316 .",
    "now the bare s - matrix is defined as @xmath317 and the renormalised s - matrix is @xmath318 . of course , for a physical definition of the renormalised s - matrix , we must inject various renormalisation and causality conditions which determine the renormalisation parameters .",
    "the mathematically - oriented reader has noticed that @xmath319 is an infinite series that does not belong to @xmath0 .",
    "there are two ways out of this problem .",
    "the first solution is to put a topology on @xmath0 and to extend @xmath0 so that infinite series are admitted .",
    "if the circle product is still defined on such an extended states , our approach enables us to manipulate non perturbative quantites , such as the s - matrix and the green function ( see below ) .",
    "this is an advantage over the feynman diagram approach .",
    "the second solution is more conservative : we can consider formal power series such as @xmath320 .",
    "such a formal power series is a compact way to represent an infinite number of terms ( i.e. one term for each @xmath321 ) @xcite .    in section [ counitsection ]",
    "we saw that the expectation value over the vacuum is equal to the counit .",
    "thus , the gell - man and low definition of the green function ( @xcite p.264 ) can be translated into the hopf algebraic approach as : the bare electron green function @xmath322 is defined by @xmath323 the renormalised electron green function @xmath324 is defined by @xmath325 a schwinger - dyson equation can be derived for @xmath322 .",
    "these examples were chosen to show that the circle product allows for a compact definition of quantum field quantities .",
    "for the simplest lagrangian @xmath326 we obtain the following identity @xmath327    a slightly more complicated lagrangian is @xmath328 this lagrangian is local in the sense that there is no cross term @xmath329 .",
    "it corresponds to a mass term @xmath330 of quantum field theory . to write the s - matrix",
    "we define the matrix @xmath279 by its matrix elements @xmath331 .",
    "then @xmath332    here , there is a small difference between the algebraic and the quantum field approaches . to make @xmath182 a map from @xmath0 to @xmath0 , we must replace all symmetric products by circle products .",
    "in particular , @xmath317 contains terms such as @xmath333 these terms @xmath334 are usually avoided in quantum field theory because they are infinite . from the physical point of view , we can say that @xmath1 is a local lagrangian and all the terms of @xmath1 are taken at the same time .",
    "therefore , the time - ordered product inside @xmath1 is not well defined and we must choose a prescription for it that agrees with experiment . according to the epstein - glaser approach , the correct time - ordered product taken at the same time is determined by renormalisation . in other words , the divergent term @xmath334",
    "is removed by choosing a renormalisation parameter ( for example @xmath335 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the removal of the density of occupied negative energy states in the dirac sea picture @xcite .",
    "in fact , in quantum electrodynamics in an external field , only a part of @xmath334 must be removed and the polarisation charge @xmath336 creates the uehling potential which is observable @xcite .    thus , for quantum electrodynamics , it is necessary to take the circle product inside the lagrangian @xmath1 .",
    "this is natural from the algebraic point of view , and this agrees with experiment .",
    "however , for scalar fields this is not necessarily the case and we need a way to keep normal products inside @xmath337 .",
    "this is again provided by rota and coll .",
    "@xcite , who define a _ divided power _ as the quantity @xmath338 for @xmath128 , with @xmath339 and @xmath340 .",
    "the divided powers have the following properties , which are deduced from the properties of @xmath341 : @xmath342 @xmath343 , @xmath344 and @xmath345 thus @xmath346 the normal product is preserved inside @xmath337 by considering the divided powers as independent variables and by defining the t - map on them by @xmath347 .",
    "the use of divided powers and their relations with the elements of @xmath2 are treated in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "we hope that we have convinced the reader that hopf algebra is a powerful and natural tool for quantum field theory .",
    "it enables us to transform combinatorial reasoning into algebraic manipulations .",
    "this paper was expository , and only the simple case of scalar fermions was treated . in a forthcoming publication",
    "we shall consider the cases of fermions and more complex problems such as the relation of the renormalization parameters with the usual counteterms of the lagrangian . we shall also discuss the question of connected products @xcite , which have a nice operadic interpretation @xcite .",
    "fermions are a relatively straightforward extension of the present formalism .",
    "the main trick is to twist the tensor product so as to account for the anticommutation property of fermions .",
    "moreover , bosons and fermions can be merged into a supersymmetric algebra @xcite .",
    "all this is necessary to consider quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the circle product of fermions is a generalization of the clifford algebra and of hestenes geometric algebra @xcite . by considering a more complicated twist",
    ", it might be possible to work with quantum groups @xcite and braided quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "since our algebra is finite dimensional , it is well suited to treat problems in lattice field theory .",
    "the circle and renormalised circle products are deformations of the normal product , thus they could be relevant to the deformation theory of quantum fields @xcite or to quantize fedorov @xcite and symplectic @xcite manifolds .",
    "but the main reason why the present formalism was developed is the calculation of the green function for a degenerate vacuum .",
    "some steps in this direction were done by kutzelnigg and mukherjee @xcite , but the combinatorial formulas are very complex because they mix time - ordered and commutation functions .",
    "we hope that our quantum field algebra can be helpful for that problem .",
    "i am extremely grateful to alessandra frabetti for her constant help and for her many suggestions and clarifications .",
    "this paper would have been much worse without her contribution .",
    "i am also very grateful to bertfried fauser for the detailed e - mails he sent me to explain his view of the connection between laplace hopf algebra and wick s theorem , and for the many comments and corrections he made to the manuscript .",
    "i thank moulay benameur for a very useful discussion .",
    "this is ipgp contribution # 0000 .",
    "in this appendix , we make a short presentation of hopf algebras .    to define a hopf algebra , we first need an algebra . an _ algebra _",
    "is a vector space @xmath348 over @xmath125 equipped with an associative linear product over @xmath348 , denoted @xmath349 and a unit , denoted @xmath350 .",
    "a product is _ linear _ if for any @xmath351 : @xmath352 , @xmath353 and @xmath354 .",
    "it is _ associative _ if for any @xmath351 : @xmath355 .",
    "the _ unit _ is the element of @xmath348 such that , for any @xmath356 , we have @xmath357 .    as an example , we consider the algebra @xmath358 generated by all sets of elements @xmath359 , where @xmath360 are vectors in @xmath361 for example .",
    "the associative product is given by the union of sets @xmath362 the unit 1 is the empty set .",
    "the most unusual concept in a hopf algebra is the coproduct , denoted @xmath52 . in general , a _",
    "coproduct _ is a linear application from @xmath348 to @xmath363 , denoted @xmath52 .",
    "the coproduct has various physical meanings .",
    "quite often , a coproduct can be considered as giving all the ways to split an element of @xmath348 into two `` parts '' .",
    "for the example of @xmath358 , the coproduct of @xmath359 is defined as @xmath364 where the sum is over all subsets @xmath365 of @xmath359 , and @xmath366 .",
    "for instance , @xmath367    to recall this ` splitting ' , the action of the coproduct is denoted by @xmath368 , where @xmath369 and @xmath370 are the first and second `` parts '' of @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath371 , we have @xmath372 and @xmath373 for the first term of @xmath374 and @xmath375 and @xmath376 for its second term .",
    "this is called sweedler s notation .    in a hopf algebra ,",
    "the coproduct is compatible with the product , in other words @xmath377 . or , more precisely @xmath378 . in mathematical terms",
    ", we say that the coproduct is an _ algebra homomorphism_.    this compatibility is often used to define the coproduct .",
    "for instance , we can consider the algebra @xmath379 generated by the angular momentum operators @xmath380 , @xmath381 and @xmath382 , where the product @xmath349 is the operator product .",
    "then the coproduct of these operators is defined by @xmath383 .",
    "we recognize here the angular momentum operators acting on products of states @xmath384 , i.e. the coupling of angular momenta .",
    "this gives us the second physical meaning of the coproduct : it is a way to go from a one - particle operator to a two - particle operator . for products of operators @xmath385 the coproduct",
    "is defined recursively by its compatibility with the operator product : @xmath386 for example @xmath387 now it is natural to go from a two - particle operator to a three - particle operator by repeating the action of the coproduct .",
    "but since @xmath388 it is not clear on which side the second @xmath52 should act : on @xmath369 or on @xmath370 ?",
    "a very important property of hopf algebras is that the result does not depend on which side you apply the coproduct . for each @xmath369",
    "we denote the action of the coproduct by @xmath389 and for each @xmath370 , @xmath390 .",
    "so , the fact that the action of the operator on three particles does not depend on the order of the coproducts amounts to @xmath391 this property is called the _",
    "coassociativity _ of the coproduct . by applying again the coproduct",
    ", we can define the action of the angular momentum operators on many - particle states .",
    "the coassociativity ensures that the result does not depend on the order used .",
    "it can be checked that the coproduct of @xmath358 and @xmath379 are coassociative .    we still need two ingredients to make a hopf algebra : a counit and an antipode .",
    "a _ counit _ is a linear map from @xmath348 to @xmath125 , denoted by @xmath53 , such that @xmath392 . in a hopf algebra ,",
    "the counit @xmath53 is an algebra homomorphism ( i.e. @xmath393 ) . in most cases ,",
    "the counit is very simple .",
    "for @xmath358 we have @xmath46 , @xmath394 for @xmath48 , for @xmath379 we have @xmath46 , @xmath395 for @xmath48 .",
    "finally the _ antipode _ is a linear map from @xmath348 to @xmath348 such that @xmath396 . the antipode is a kind of inverse .",
    "its main general property is that @xmath397 . in our examples : for @xmath358 the antipode is defined by @xmath50 and @xmath398 , so that @xmath399 for @xmath48 , for @xmath379 the antipode is defined by @xmath50 and @xmath400 , so that @xmath401 for @xmath48 .    to summarize a _ hopf algebra",

    "the reader can check that @xmath358 and @xmath379 are cocommutative hopf algebras .",
