    "quantum chaos is one of the most challenge research topics in both theoretical and experimental physics . in the past decade , in order to understand the concept of quantum chaos , people have been focusing on seeking the generic behavior in quantum spectra and wave functions of various dynamical systems whose classical dynamics are chaotic . in these investigations ,",
    "two significant features have been found .",
    "one of them is the relation between the quantum energy level statistical distributions of the classical chaotic systems and the goe / gue spectral statistical universality classes of the random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the other feature is the existence of  scars \" in individual eigenstate wave functions , i.e. , the appearance of strong localization of wave functions along the unstable periodic orbits in chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamical mechanism of quantum manifestation of chaos is still not well understood so far .    in order to study the dynamical mechanism of quantum manifestation of chaos , one of us developed an approach , called the semiquantal approach @xcite .",
    "the main motivation of this approach is to provide a framework to study how quantum fluctuations , quantum correlations and other quantum phenomena manifest themselves in the classical trajectories .",
    "this approach differs from the above mentioned investigations .",
    "it starts from quantum systems without reference to classical limit and it directly explores the dynamics of quantum effects in classical chaotic trajectories .",
    "therefore , it provides a systematic way to explore the intrinsic mechanism of quantum manifestation of chaos@xcite .",
    "the general theoretical framework of the semiquantal approach is the stationary phase approximation of the generalized coherent state path integral @xcite .",
    "each set of generalized coherent states associated with the dynamical group @xmath0 of a quantum system forms an over - complete set of states for an irreducible representation space of @xmath0 .",
    "the coherent states are also in one - to - one corresponding to a geometrical space which has a symplectic structure .",
    "we called this geometrical space the quantum phase space .",
    "based on path integral formulation , coherent states then embed each quantum system in a quantum phase space , regardless of whether the system has a classical counterpart or not . the stationary phase approximation further results in a set of dynamical equations of motion on this quantum phase space , which are similar to the classical equations of motion .",
    "but the hamiltonian function governed these dynamical equations of motion is the expectation values of the hamiltonian operator in the generalized coherent states , which contain the leading quantum fluctuations and correlations .",
    "we called these equations of motion the semiquantal dynamical equations .",
    "this formulation allows us to directly explore the dynamical effects of quantum fluctuations and correlations to chaos @xcite .",
    "based on this formulation of semiquantal dynamics , we will study in this paper the dynamical effect of the pauli exclusive principle to chaotic motions .",
    "we shall take the sp(6 ) model , the sp(6 ) symmetry of the fermion dynamical symmetry model in nuclear many - body systems @xcite , as our example .",
    "this model is a microscopic description of nuclear collective dynamics with fermions as the building blocks .",
    "a significant feature of this model is that the pauli principle of fermions has a crucial influence on the low - lying nuclear collective modes , which manifests themselves in experimental data@xcite .",
    "when we define a set of canonical deformation variables ( the quantum phase space ) associated with the sp(6 ) coherent states , the connection between bohr - mottelson geometrical model @xcite and the sp(6 ) model can be built @xcite .",
    "the pauli effect in the sp(6 ) model itself manifests in the nuclear deformation in terms of some constraints on the nuclear surface ( deformation ) variables @xcite . within the semiquantal framework ,",
    "the poincare s picture of chaos can be applied to describe the possible chaotic dynamics in nuclear collective motion in the aforementioned quantum phase space .",
    "therefore , dynamical pauli effect to chaos can be explicitly studied .",
    "our result shows that dynamical pauli effect enhances the pairing correlations ( quantum correlation ) and inhibits nuclear deformation .",
    "this gives rise to the breaking of dynamical symmetry and therefore leads to the occurrence of chaos .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2 ,",
    "the nuclear shape in terms of the microscopic fermion degrees of freedom is parameterized through the sp(6 ) coherent states .",
    "the coherent state of the sp(6 ) model in the nuclear body frame is constructed so that the quantum phase space of the sp(6 ) model is connected with the nuclear geometrical model . in sec .  3 ,",
    "the semiquantal dynamical equations of motion for nuclear deformation is derived . with the consideration of time - reversal invariance and valence nucleon number conservation ,",
    "the resulting equations of motion are reduced to a set of hamilton - like equations in a four - dimensional quantum phase space , which describes the nuclear surface motions . in sec .  4",
    ", we explore the geometrical manifestation of dynamical pauli effect and numerically examine the dynamical effect of the pauli principle and dynamical symmetry breaking in semiquantal framework , from which we find that quantum chaos appears when dynamical symmetry is broken and dynamical pauli effect enhances quantum chaos . finally , a summary is presented in sec .  5 .",
    "we begin with the fermion dynamical symmetry sp(6 ) model @xcite which describe the nuclear collective motions .",
    "the sp(6 ) group is spanned by the collective pairing operators @xmath1 and the collective particle - hole quadrupole operators @xmath2 .",
    "the model hamiltonian operator is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the particle number operator .",
    "the coefficient @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the strength of the internal energy , effective pairing and multiple interactions , respectively .",
    "it is worth noticing that the @xmath7-pairing interactions are not included in eq .",
    "( [ eq32 ] ) because such interactions can be replaced by the @xmath8-pairing and multiple interactions in the sp(6 ) symmetry@xcite .",
    "also , in order to study chaotic dynamics of nuclear deformation under the sp(6 ) model , we should only consider the dynamics of different intrinsic bands rather then the collective motion within a single band .",
    "therefore , we can let @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq32 ] ) .    to study the nuclear surface motions in the sp(6 ) model within the semiquantal framework , one must first construct the corresponding quantum phase space .",
    "it has been shown that such a quantum phase space is uniquely realized by the coset space usp(6)/u(3 ) through the sp(6 ) coherent states .",
    "( the detailed construction of the coherent states of the sp(6 ) model can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "it has also been roughly summarized in appendix a. )    in the following subsections , we will parametrize the nuclear shape in the above mentioned quantum phase space by visualizing nuclear deformation to be a geometrical description of the microscopic sp(6 ) fermion model . as it is well - known ,",
    "the dynamics of nuclear deformation has time reversal invariance .",
    "meantime , it is also convenient to describe nuclear deformation in the nuclear intrinsic frame in which adequate deformed variables can be chosen as the coordinates of the sp(6 ) quantum phase space .",
    "first , we shall look at the connection of the sp(6 ) coherent states ( cs ) with nuclear deformation . in the macroscopic picture of the nuclear geometrical model , the rotational and vibrational energy spectrum of nuclei",
    "are described in according to the nuclear surface motions .",
    "the nuclear surface can be defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the maximum thickness of a nucleus , @xmath12 the radius of frozen core , and @xmath13 the spherical harmonic function . in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , the quadrupole terms ( with @xmath14 ) play the dominant role in the description of nuclear deformation .",
    "they determine the strength of nuclear surface motions .",
    "the monopole term ( @xmath15 ) describes the shell thickness of the undeformed compressible nucleus .",
    "when the center of nuclei is fixed in a reference frame ( no translation ) , the effect of @xmath16 term can be ignored . besides , all the surface variables in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) satisfy the time reversal symmetry so that @xmath17    to generalize this concept into the framework of a microscopic description , we introduce a deformation matrix @xmath18 , @xmath19 which is related to the quadrupole momentum in the sp(6 ) model , where @xmath20 is a 3@xmath213 identity matrix ; and @xmath22 the submatrix block of the quadrupole momentum operator @xmath23 in the @xmath24 matrix representation of the sp(6 ) group",
    ". the detailed expressions can be found in appendix a of ref.@xcite .",
    "these submatrices @xmath25 form an irreducible representation of the unitary subgroup u(3 ) .",
    "they determine the deformation properties of nucleus .",
    "the surface variables @xmath26 still obey the time reversal invariance condition ( [ eq2 ] ) , and the coefficient @xmath27 is chosen to be negative .",
    "this is because the shell thickness of the undeformed nucleus is positive , and also the quadrupole momentum must also be positive when the particle number is less than @xmath28 , where @xmath28 is the pair degeneracy of normal - parity levels in a major shell ( i.e. @xmath29 in the sp(6 ) model ) . in this paper",
    "we only consider the case of valence particle number @xmath30 .",
    "for the case @xmath31 , an analogous discussion can be made because of the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "next , we shall build the connection between the surface variables @xmath32 and the parameters in the sp(6 ) coherent states . as one can find in ref.@xcite ( also see appendix a ) , the sp(6 ) coherent state @xmath33",
    "is completely determined by a @xmath34 parameter matrix * x*. meantime , the @xmath34 hermitian matrix @xmath35 can be spanned by @xmath22 : @xmath36 where @xmath25 obey the condition : @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , the hermitian property of the matrix @xmath35 implies that @xmath38 which corresponds to the time reversal invariance .    without any loss of generality , we can set the matrix @xmath39 to be equal to the deformation matrix @xmath18 by letting @xmath40 .",
    "the connection between the surface variables @xmath41 and the coherent state parameters in @xmath42 can then be carried out .",
    "the properties of nuclear deformation determined by the sp(6 ) cs are described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq2]-[eq3 ] ) and the requirement @xmath43 .",

    "we call the cs describing the nuclear deformation in the nuclear intrinsic frame the intrinsic coherent states ( ics ) . in the intrinsic frame ,",
    "the deformation matrix is positive and diagonal . to deduce the ics ,",
    "a basic idea is to decompose the previous spherical tensor operators into proper cartesian tensor operators .",
    "the cartesian tensor operator @xmath46 are defined as follows : @xmath47 where the index @xmath48 for @xmath46 .",
    "such an index assignment corresponds to a choice of the left - hand coordinate system in order to be consistent with the notations used in ref.@xcite .",

    "the phase space of nuclear deformation is a six - dimensional space .",
    "the six independent variables are now completely determined by the three complex parameters of @xmath72 in ics .    based on ics ,",
    "the nuclear deformation is described by the variables @xmath81 only .",

    "the deformation matrix then becomes : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the subblock matrix in the matrix representation of @xmath46 , and @xmath90 according to eq .",

    "in other words , @xmath92 are the variables measuring nuclear deformation .",
    "these are exactly the dynamical variables we want to use to study the nuclear surface motions .",
    "once we have constructed the sp(6 ) cs in the intrinsic frame , we can now derive the semiquantal dynamical equations of the nuclear collective motions .",
    "the semiquantal dynamics of the sp(6 ) model is determined by the time - dependent variational approach to the effective action ( i.e. the stationary phase approximation of the generalized cs path integral ) : @xmath93 the result of such a variation is a set of hamilton - like equations @xmath94 these equations of motion are the semiquantal dynamical equations which approximately describe the quantum dynamics of nuclear deformation in the sp(6 ) model .",
    "the word `` approximately '' ( or semiquantal ) means that this is an approximation of the sch \" odinger equation described by the hamilton - like equations of motion but it is derived purely from quantum mechanics .",
    "and the hamiltonian function @xmath95 contains all the leading order quantum correlations . in nuclear many - body systems , this set of equations of motion is indeed the familiar time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations under the constraint of dynamical symmetry group sp(6 ) @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq31 ] ) contains six equations of motion . however , not all these six equations of motions are independent .",
    "this is because for a given nucleus , the valence nucleon number is fixed : @xmath96 in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq31 ] ) , the constraint of the fixing valence nucleon number must be imposed . in the next subsection",

    "therefore , the quantum phase space of nuclear deformation is reduced to a four - dimensional space after solving the constraint of the fixing valence nucleon number .",
    "thus , we have formulated the semiquantal dynamics of the sp(6 ) model in a four - dimensional quantum phase space , which determines the dynamical evolution of nuclear deformation .",
    "although we have formulated the semiquantal dynamics of the sp(6 ) model in a four - dimensional phase space , this phase space is still an nontrivial geometrical space .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , this quantum phase space is a compact space .",
    "it is embedded in a four - dimensional flat space . besides , due to the pauli effect of the sp(6 ) model @xcite , not the whole domain of this quantum phase space is dynamically allowed .",
    "when the valence nucleon number @xmath146 , some region is forbidden due to the pauli effect @xcite .",

    "the matrix @xmath149 has the form : @xmath150 since the matrix @xmath151 is hermitian , it means that @xmath152 .",
    "together with the condition of the fixing valence nucleon number , @xmath153 , we obtain the following conclusion : when @xmath154  @xmath155 [ see eq .",
    "( [ fvnm ] ) ] , the condition @xmath156 is not satisfied for the whole domain .",
    "a forbidden region appears in the quantum phase space , and its contour plotted in @xmath157 plane can be determined by using eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "when @xmath158",
    "@xmath159 , the condition @xmath156 is always satisfied so that there is no forbidden region in the phase space .",
    "note that the critical value @xmath160 has an important consequence in the sp(6 ) model .",
    "when @xmath161 , the nuclear collective motions can be described in the symmetric representation of the subgroup su(3 ) of sp(6 ) , which behaves the same as the bosonic su(3 ) representation . however , when @xmath162 , the pauli principle forces the system to move to an asymmetric representation of su(3 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the nuclear deformation will be limited in the quantum phase space .",
    "the condition @xmath156 is indeed such a phase space constraint of the pauli effect in the sp(6 ) model @xcite .    in conclusion , within the constraint of the fixing valence nucleon number and the presence of the pauli effect , the quantum phase space of the sp(6 ) model is only a limited domain in a four - dimensional flat space restricted by @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "this is a pure quantum mechanical effect on geometry . in the following",
    ", we shall explore the dynamical consequence of these quantum effects to the chaotic motions .      in this subsection",
    ", we shall numerically analyze the chaotic motion in the sp(6 ) model .",
    "since the semiquantal dynamics is determined by the hamilton - like equations of motion ( [ sp6em ] ) , the chaos can be described in terms of poincare surface of section ( pss ) .",
    "we will first examine the nuclear surface motions in the dynamical symmetry limits of the sp(6 ) model .",
    "the hamiltonian in the intrinsic frame can be expressed as : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is an effective kinetic energy which contains the general kinetic energy and a velocity - dependent potential ; and @xmath167 is an effective potential of the sp(6 ) model derived in appendix b. in the intrinsic frame , the sp(6 ) model has two group chains : the su(2 ) chain ( with @xmath168 ) and the su(3 ) chain ( with @xmath169 ) .",
    "these two limiting cases describe the nuclear vibrational mode and the @xmath170-stable rotational mode , respectively .",
    "the numerical results of fig . 1a and",
    "1b shows that their pss are regular .",
    "this is because the existence of dynamical symmetries in these two limits guarantees the integrability of dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , when both @xmath171 and @xmath172 are not equal to zero , the above dynamical symmetries are broken and chaos appears .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "1c .    to demonstrate the chaotic behavior in the nuclear surface motions",
    ", we fix the rate @xmath173 and vary the particle number @xmath174 to analyze the phase space structure of the semiquantal dynamics .",
    "there is a phase transition from the vibrational to the rotational modes in the nuclear surface motions . according to the result in ref .",
    "@xcite , this phase transition is associated with the dynamical symmetry breaking from the su(2 ) to the su(3 ) limit with fixed @xmath173 , and taking @xmath174 as the control parameter . therefore , chaos must occur accompanied with this phase transition @xcite . in the following numerical calculation ,",
    "we take @xmath175 mev and @xmath176 mev with @xmath177 .",
    "note that the chaotic behavior also varies with the energy which can be regarded as a scale for analyzing the strength of chaotic motion .",
    "the numerical results show that the patterns of pss in the sp(6 ) model can be divided into three types with @xmath174 increasing .",
    "foe the cases of @xmath178 , the pss have the ` similar ' patterns with the energy increasing .",
    "we classify this type of pss class a. the cases @xmath179 form class b , and @xmath180 form class c. here , the word ` similar ' means that the pss are topologically similar , namely , the pss of two states have the similar type of kam surfaces and the similar distribution of chaotic phase space structure .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "2c and 2d , the state of @xmath181 mev with @xmath182 is similar to the state of @xmath183 mev with @xmath184 .",
    "analogously , the state @xmath185 mev with @xmath182 is similar to @xmath186 mev with @xmath184 , and @xmath187 mev with @xmath182 is similar to @xmath188 mev with @xmath184 .",
    "physically , this classification depends on the contribution rate of the quadrupole and the pairing interactions . roughly speaking",
    ", class a corresponds to the states with pairing interaction dominating , class c with quadrupole interaction dominating , and class b is the mixed states . in fig . 2 ,",
    "six special cases of the pss are plotted .",
    "they show the differences of pss among the classes a , b and c. these poincare surfaces of section ( with @xmath189 are plotted in the @xmath190 plane @xmath191 , and have a @xmath192 -axis symmetry .    in order to define chaotic strength in a uniform way",
    ", we rescale the time @xmath193 [ @xmath194 such that the minimum values of the allowed energy are rescaled to @xmath195 for all the values of @xmath174 .",
    "this rescaling does not change the structure of the corresponding pss .",
    "also , for convenience , we introduce three energy scales : @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 . the energy scale @xmath198 is the starting energy of the strong quantum chaos , @xmath197 the starting energy of the weak quantum chaos , and @xmath196 the upper bound of energy within which the sp(6 ) model dominates the low - lying nuclear dynamics .",
    "thus , for a given nucleus , the dynamical behavior of physical states can be divided into three types of motions : the pure regular motion which exists in the energy range from @xmath195 to @xmath197 , the weak chaotic motion in the range of @xmath197 to @xmath198 , and the strong chaotic motion in the range of @xmath198 to @xmath196 .",
    "recalling the ` pattern classification ' of the chaotic behavior aforementioned , systems with different @xmath174 in the same class have similar patterns of pss .",
    "thus , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath196 are all @xmath174 dependent .",
    "we plot the phase diagram of chaotic behavior in the nuclear surface motions in the @xmath199@xmath174 plane in fig .",
    "the chaotic strength is obtained by comparing the values of @xmath198 and @xmath197 in different @xmath174 .    from fig .",
    "3 , we see that when @xmath174=2 and 4 ( small @xmath174 ) , the contribution of the quadrupole interaction @xmath200 is much smaller than the pairing interaction @xmath201 .",
    "this implies that the system is near in the su(2 ) @xmath202 sp(6 ) dynamical symmetry .",
    "correspondingly , the nuclear surface motion is near - integrable .",
    "hence , for small @xmath174 , the nuclear deformation is regular in all the energy ranges , as shown in fig . 3 where @xmath203 for small @xmath174 .",
    "this corresponds to class a. when @xmath174 is near @xmath204 , we find that the quadrupole interactions is dominant .",
    "the nuclei are approximately described by the su(3 ) @xmath205 sp(6 ) dynamical symmetry . as we can see from fig .",
    "3 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 are far from the minimum energy @xmath195 .",
    "therefore the phase space is filled mostly by the regular motion as well ( with @xmath206 ) .",
    "this corresponds to class c. when the particle number @xmath174 is between 8 to 14 , the pairing interaction and the quadrupole interactions compete against each other , and all the dynamical symmetries in the sp(6 ) model are broken .",
    "this is the transition ( mixed ) region from the vibration to rotation in nuclear collective motions .",
    "the chaotic motion is very strong as it is shown in fig .",
    "3 . this corresponds to class b.    the most remarkable result we find in this study is in the region @xmath207 .",
    "naively , when @xmath208 , the quadrupole interaction should be dominant so that the system should approximately have the su(3 ) dynamical symmetry .",

    "3 tells us that when @xmath174 varies from @xmath209 to the middle shell ( @xmath210 ) , the strength of chaotic dynamics is increased .",
    "this unusual result is indeed caused by the pauli effect .",
    "the pauli principle forces the system to jump from the symmetric su(3 ) representation to the antisymmetric su(3 ) representation when @xmath208 .",
    "this reduces the nuclear deformation ( inhibiting the quadrupole interaction and increasing pairing interaction ) . as a result ,",
    "the system deviates away from the su(3 ) dynamical symmetry and therefore leads to the stronger chaos .",
    "this is the first example to dynamically examine the pauli effect on chaos .",
    "it is also the first evidence of showing the enhancement of chaos in quantum system due to the pauli principle .",
    "in this paper , the sp(6 ) model have been chosen as an example to examine the chaotic dynamics in quantum systems caused by dynamical symmetry breaking and dynamical pauli effect .",
    "it has been tested for many systems where dynamical symmetry breaking is closely related to quantum chaos @xcite . however , this is the first paper to address the problem of pauli effect on chaotic dynamics .",
    "since pauli effect is a pure quantum mechanical phenomenon and it has no classical limit , its influence on chaos is certainly an important key to understand the intrinsic mechanism of quantum chaos . in this paper",
    ", we only present the evidence of pauli effect on chaos in a specific system .",
    "the most interesting and challenge questions are whether the dynamical pauli effect can always enhance chaotic motions and what generic role does the pauli principle play in nonlinear dynamics of quantum theory",
