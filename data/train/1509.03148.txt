    "neutrino physics is entering a new era .",
    "after the discovery of a relatively large value of @xmath9 , the determination of leptonic cp violation ( cpv ) and the identification of the neutrino mass hierarchy ( nmh ) have become realistic targets . in this respect ,",
    "the long - baseline ( lbl ) experiments represent the first setups able to probe these properties .",
    "one of them ( t2k ) , already operative since 2011 , has provided the first observation of the conversion of muon neutrinos into electron neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "this result , in combination with the precise determination of the third mixing angle @xmath9 achieved with the dedicated reactor experiments  @xcite , has provided the first _ indirect _ information on cpv .",
    "in fact , all the recent global  @xcite and partial  @xcite ( including only reactor and t2k data ) fits indicate a slight preference for cpv , with a best fit value of the fundamental cp - phase @xmath10 close to the value @xmath11 .    a few weeks ago",
    "the t2k experiment has presented the first appearance results in the antineutrino channel  @xcite . in the same days",
    "the experiment no@xmath0a has released the first appearance data in the neutrino channel  @xcite .",
    "although both measurements have a limited statistical power it is nonetheless interesting to consider their impact on the preexisting scenario . with this purpose ,",
    "we here present both a 3-flavor and a 4-flavor analysis of the results of the two long - baseline experiments , updating our previous work  @xcite .",
    "we underline that the latest t2k and nova data considered in the present work are of particular importance .",
    "arguably , they represent the most important piece of information in the current neutrino landscape .",
    "in fact , these data allow us to probe for the first time in a direct ( or manifest ) way the leptonic cpv .",
    "it is the first time that a hint of cpv arises from the comparison of the observations of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "in contrast , in all the previous analyses the indication on the cp - phase @xmath10 was indirect , since it arose from the combination of long - baseline ( t2k ) data and reactor data ( daya - bay , reno and double - chooz ) .",
    "our analysis shows that the role of reactor data , albeit still significant , is now less pronounced in determining the estimate of the cp - phase @xmath10 .",
    "this trend is likely to be reinforced in the future since the current lbl appearance data represent only a small fraction ( @xmath12 ) of their total planned exposure .",
    "we recall that the lbl experiments are sensitive to cpv because they can probe the interference of two distinct oscillating frequencies . in the 3-flavor case ,",
    "the two frequencies in question are related to the atmospheric squared - mass splitting and to the solar one . in the 4-flavor case",
    ", the interference occurs between the fast ( averaged ) oscillations induced by the new @xmath13(ev@xmath14 ) splitting and the atmospheric one .",
    "as first shown in  @xcite , the new interference term has an amplitude comparable to that of the standard 3-flavor one .",
    "therefore , it is possible to extract from lbl experiments some information on the enlarged cpv sector involved in the 3 + 1 scheme .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the data preferred the common value @xmath15 ( where @xmath6 ) .",
    "such a behavior was essentially driven by the slight mismatch existing between the two determinations of @xmath9 achieved respectively with reactor and t2k data .",
    "we also recall that the lbl experiments are sensitive to the nmh because of the msw effect  @xcite , which induce ( tiny ) modifications of the mass - mixing parameters in matter that depend on the sign of the atmospheric splitting . in a sense , also this phenomenon may be regarded as a kind of interference , occurring between the msw potential ( whose sign is known ) and the atmospheric squared - mass splitting ( whose sign is unknown and to be determined ) .",
    "the same phenomenon is at the basis of the planned measurements of the nmh with atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite , where there is the advantage that the cpv interference effects are less important and there is no degeneracy among the determination of cpv and nmh , which instead notoriously plagues the lbl measurements .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the interference of the msw matter potential with the atmospheric frequency is also present in the propagation of solar neutrinos ( see for example  @xcite ) , but unfortunately its amplitude is too small to extract any useful information from it ( at least with the present data ) .",
    "our 3-flavor fit evidences a consolidation of the previous hints , namely a slight preference for @xmath3 and a mild preference ( at more than 68% c.l . ) for the normal hierarchy . in a 3 + 1 framework ,",
    "the data are able to constrain two ( of the three ) cp - phases ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , which exhibit a slight preference for the common value @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , in the enlarged four neutrino scheme the preference for the normal hierarchy found within the 3-flavor framework completely disappears . this occurs because the mismatch between the two estimates of @xmath9 provided by reactor and lbl experiments ( more pronounced in the ih case ) can be  cured \" with an appropriated choice of the new cp - phase @xmath7 .",
    "this circumstance indicates that light sterile neutrinos may constitute a potential source of fragility in the capability of the two lbl experiments of discriminating the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the theoretical framework needed to discuss the analytical behavior of the lbl @xmath16 and @xmath17 transition probabilities in the 3-flavor and 4-flavor frameworks . in sec .",
    "iii we present the results of the numerical analysis . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "in the presence of a fourth sterile neutrino @xmath18 , the flavor and the mass eigenstates are connected through a @xmath19 mixing matrix . a convenient parameterization of the mixing matrix is @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) represents a real ( complex ) @xmath19 rotation in the ( @xmath23 ) plane containing the @xmath24 submatrix    @xmath25    in the @xmath26 sub - block , with @xmath27 the parameterization in eq .  ( [ eq : u ] ) enjoys the following properties : i ) for vanishing mixing with the fourth state @xmath28 it returns the 3-flavor matrix in its usual parameterization .",
    "ii ) the leftmost positioning of the matrix @xmath29 makes the vacuum @xmath30 conversion probability independent of @xmath31 ( and the related cp - phase @xmath32 ) .",
    "iii ) for small values of @xmath9 and of the mixing angles involving the fourth mass eigenstate , one has @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( exact ) , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with a clear physical interpretation of the new mixing angles .",
    "let us now come to the transition probability relevant for t2k and no@xmath0a . from the discussion made in  @xcite",
    ", it emerges that the conversion probability can be approximated as the sum of three terms @xmath37 the first term represents the positive definite atmospheric transition probability , the second term is related to the standard solar - atmospheric interference , while the third term is driven by the atmospheric - sterile interference .",
    "the probability depends on the three mixing angles @xmath38 , which can be all assumed to be of the same order @xmath39 and on the ratio of the solar and atmospheric squared - mass splittings @xmath40 , which is of order @xmath41 . keeping terms up to the third order , in vacuum",
    ", one finds @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the atmospheric oscillating frequency , which depends on the baseline @xmath44 and the neutrino energy @xmath45 .",
    "the matter effects slightly modify the transition probability , introducing a dependency on the ratio @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the ( constant ) matter potential along the neutrino trajectory . both in t2k and in no@xmath0a",
    "the value of @xmath48 is relatively small , being @xmath49 in t2k , and @xmath50 in no@xmath0a , where we have taken as a benchmark the peak energy of the two neutrino beams ( @xmath51 gev in t2k , @xmath52 gev in no@xmath0a ) .",
    "therefore , it is natural to treat @xmath48 as a small parameter of order @xmath39 . the probability in matter can be simply obtained ( see the appendix in  @xcite and the works  @xcite ) by making in the vacuum expression the following substitutions @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent the mixing angle @xmath56 and the atmospheric oscillation frequency in matter , which for small values of @xmath48 , take the form @xmath57 it can be shown that at the peak energy , where @xmath58 , the substitutions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : matt_sub ] ) - ( [ eq : matt_delta ] ) produce third order corrections only in the atmospheric term , which reads @xmath59 while the same substitutions in the two interference terms produce only corrections of the fourth order .",
    "the swap of the nmh is parametrized by the replacements @xmath60 one can observe that , while in general , the two interference terms are not invariant under a swap of the nmh , around the oscillation maximum @xmath61 , such an invariance is approximately valid .",
    "therefore , in practice the effect of the nmh swap is captured by the modification of the leading term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pme_atm_matt ] ) . due to the change of sign of @xmath48 , the transition probability ( which acquires the dominant contribution from the atmospheric term ) increases ( decreases ) with respect to the vacuum case in the nh ( ih ) case .",
    "no@xmath0a is expected to be more sensitive than t2k to the nmh because of the larger value of the ratio @xmath48 .    finally , we recall that the transition probability for antineutrinos is obtained from that of neutrinos by changing the sign of the msw potential @xmath62 and of all the cp - phases .",
    "this , for a given choice of the nmh , corresponds to the substitutions @xmath63 in the nh case @xmath64 for neutrinos and @xmath65 for antineutrinos . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pme_atm_matt ] ) , in the nh case the leading contribution to the transition probability will increase ( decrease ) for neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) . in the ih case the opposite conclusion holds . when passing from neutrinos to antineutrinos , the first interference term ( around the oscillation maximum ) changes sign , since it is essentially proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast , the second interference term remains approximately invariant , since it depends on @xmath67 .",
    "remarkably , for typical values of the mixing angles preferred by the current global 3 + 1 fits , the amplitude of the ( atmospheric - sterile ) interference term is almost identical to that of the standard ( solar - atmospheric ) interference term . as a consequence , a substantial impact on the regions reconstructed by the experiments t2k and no@xmath0a in the pane of the two parameters [ @xmath68 is expected .",
    "in addition , a similar sensitivity to the two cp - phases @xmath69 and @xmath7 is expected in the combination of the two lbl experiments with the reactor data .",
    "in our numerical analysis we include the reactor experiments daya - bay and reno and the two lbl experiments t2k and no@xmath0a .",
    "the analysis of lbl data is slightly different for the two cases of three and four flavors , since in this last case there are appreciable oscillation effects not only at the far detector but also at the near detector , which have been taken into account as described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the reactor experiments is performed using the total rate information and following the approach described in  @xcite . for both experiments",
    "we have used the latest data  @xcite based , respectively , on 621 live days ( daya bay ) and 800 live days ( reno ) .",
    "since the electron neutrino survival probability probed by these experiments is independent of the cp - violating phases ( standard and non - standard ) , their estimate of @xmath9 is independent of them .",
    "we recall that such an estimate is extracted using the ratio of the event rates measured at the far and at the near sites .",
    "since the fast oscillations induced by @xmath70 are averaged out at both detector sites , daya bay and reno are not sensitive to 4-flavor effects . as a result ,",
    "their estimate of @xmath9 is independent of the mixing angle @xmath71 as long as it is allowed to vary in the range we are exploring .",
    "concerning the lbl experiments , we use the t2k results of the @xmath16 appearance searches  @xcite , which reported 28 events with an estimated background of 4.92 events and the preliminary results of the @xmath17 searches presented at the eps hep conference  @xcite , which report 3 events with an estimated background of 1.68 events . for no@xmath0a",
    "we use the preliminary results presented at fermilab  @xcite .",
    "it must be noticed that the no@xmath0a collaboration , prior to unbinding the data , decided to show the results obtained with two different event selection procedures ( lid and lem ) .",
    "the first is considered the primary method by the collaboration so we conservatively use the results obtained with such a method , which selects 6 events over an estimated background of 0.94 events . for completeness , we will comment on the results that are obtained by using the secondary lem selector , which identifies a considerably larger number ( 11 ) of events ( the background being very similar to the lid case ) in comparison to the primary lid method .    in order to calculate the theoretical expectation for the total number of t2k @xmath2 events and their binned spectrum in the reconstructed neutrino energy , we convolve the product of the @xmath72 flux  @xcite with horns operating in the + 250 ka mode ( tables provided on the t2k home page  @xcite ) , the charged current quasi elastic ( ccqe ) cross - section ( estimated from  @xcite ) , and the @xmath16 transition probability , with an appropriate energy resolution function .",
    "a similar procedure is followed for the antineutrino channel , where we have used the @xmath73 fluxes with horns operating in the -250 ka mode plotted in  @xcite .",
    "concerning no@xmath0a we used directly the product of the neutrino fluxes with the cross section ( extrapolated at the far detector ) provided in  @xcite .",
    "we have checked that our prediction for the binned spectra of events are in good agreement with those shown by the collaborations .",
    "we have performed the 3-flavor analysis both using the total rate information and the full spectrum , observing very small differences between the two methods .",
    "this is due to the limited statistics currently available , and to the effect of the smearing induced by the energy resolution . as explained in  @xcite , in the 4-flavor case , from outside the collaborations",
    ", it is possible to consistently perform only a total rate analysis .",
    "therefore , for homogeneity , also in the 3-flavor case , we report the results obtained with the total rate information .",

    "when possible [ t2k ( @xmath2 ) and no@xmath0a ( @xmath2 ) ] , we have verified that the results of our analysis obtained for the single experiments in each channel return basically the contour plots presented by the collaborations .",

    ", the contours determined by the combination of t2k and no@xmath0a are closed regions around the best fit value @xmath80 .",
    "this means , that thanks to the information coming from the two channels ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) the lbl experiments are starting to probe the cp symmetry in a _ direct _ way .",

    "in addition , we note that the weak preference for the case of normal hierarchy tends to consolidate , being @xmath86 , to be compared with the result @xmath87 obtained in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "however , the statistical significance of the indication is still small and below the 90% c.l .",
    "a final remark is in order concerning the two events selection methods used by no@xmath0a .",
    "as already stressed above , we have conservatively adopted the results obtained with the primary selector , based on a likelihood identification ( lid ) method . by adopting the results obtained with the alternative method , based on a library event matching ( lem ) selector , which identifies a relatively larger number of @xmath2 events ( 11 vs 6 )",
    ", we find that both the indication on the cp - phase @xmath69 and that on the nmh are slightly enhanced .",
    "more precisely , the rejection of the cp - conservation cases ( @xmath88 ) and the rejection of the inverted hierarchy both rise , respectively , at about the @xmath89 level and @xmath90 level .",
    "a combination of the results obtained with the two events selection methods is not trivial because they are strongly correlated .",
    "however , one can guess that such a combined analysis would provide results which are intermediate between those obtained using the two methods .",

    "therefore , the two classes of experiments ( sbl and lbl ) are complementary and synergic in constraining the 4-flavor parameter space .",
    "while a discovery of a sterile neutrino can come only from the observation of the oscillating pattern ( in energy or / and space ) at the new sbl experiments , the full exploration of the 4@xmath0 model will become possible only with the contribution of lbl setups , which are sensible interferometers able to probe the new enlarged cpv sector . also the (",
    "present and future ) atmospheric neutrino data may help to shed light on this issue , since these neutrinos traverse very long baselines and may present some sensitivity to the new cpv phenomena .",

    "<S> the two long - baseline experiments t2k and no@xmath0a have recently presented new findings . </S>",
    "<S> t2k has shown the first @xmath1 appearance data while no@xmath0a has released the first @xmath2 appearance results . </S>",
    "<S> these data are of particular importance because they allow us to probe for the first time in a direct ( or manifest ) way the leptonic cp - violation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is the first time that a hint of cp - violation arises from the comparison of the observations of neutrinos and antineutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the implications of such new results both for the standard 3-flavor framework and for the non - standard 3 + 1 scheme involving one sterile neutrino species . </S>",
    "<S> the 3-flavor analysis shows a consolidation of the previous trends , namely a slight preference for @xmath3 , disfavoring cp conservation ( @xmath4 ) with a statistical significance close to @xmath5 c.l . , and a mild preference ( at more than 68% c.l . ) for the normal hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> in a 3 + 1 framework , the data constrain two cp - phases ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , which exhibit a slight preference for the common value @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in the enlarged four neutrino scheme the preference for the normal hierarchy found within the 3-flavor framework completely disappears . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that light sterile neutrinos may constitute a potential source of fragility in the capability of the two lbl experiments of discriminating the neutrino mass hierarchy . </S>"
