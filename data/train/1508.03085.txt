    "low dimensional systems are platforms for research into a variety of quantum behavior . however , the broader application of such devices in an engineering context is limited due to unpredictable local variations in the electrostatic landscape in the device s active area .",
    "when considering their practical application it is important to study the statistical spread in device characteristics .",
    "we have previously studied identical devices fabricated on a modulation doped heterostructure which show variations in their conductance properties  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of gate size on two important quantum properties of split gate devices  the conductance quantization @xcite and the occurrence of 0.7 anomaly @xcite .",
    "the split gate is the simplest mesoscopic device that can be used to study how device behavior is affected by gate size .",
    "the conductance through a split gate  @xcite is quantized in multiples of @xmath0 as a function of the voltage applied to the gates  @xcite , due to the formation of one - dimensional ( 1d ) subbands .",
    "for an ideal 1d conductor , this does not depend on the length as long as transport remains ballistic .",
    "the effect of split gate size can be investigated either by varying lithographic dimensions @xcite , or fabricating several split gates in close - proximity which act in series to modify the potential of a single 1d channel  @xcite .",
    "so far it has been shown that the split - gate voltage ( @xmath1 ) at which the conductance through the 1d channel is pinched off occurs closer to zero for longer and narrower devices  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the quality of conductance quantization degrades as the gate length increases @xcite .",
    "this latter effect is related to the higher probability of encountering an impurity in the channel with longer / wider split gates , and fluctuations in the background disorder potential which modifies the potential landscape in the channel area .",
    "some studies of the effect of split gate size have focused on the 0.7 anomaly @xcite , a conductance feature which occurs near @xmath2  @xcite which arises from enhanced electron interactions at low conductance .",
    "a reduction in the conductance of the 0.7 anomaly for longer split gates has been reported  @xcite .",
    "another study using split gates in series has shown periodic modulations in the value of the 0.7 anomaly as a function of 1d channel length @xcite .",
    "the origin of the 0.7 anomaly is currently debated , theories proposed for its occurrence include spontaneous spin polarization  @xcite , the kondo effect  @xcite , wigner crystallization  @xcite , and inelastic scattering plus the local enhancement ( smeared van hove singularity ) of the 1d density of states  @xcite .",
    "we use a multiplexing scheme  @xcite to measure 95 split gates of 7 different sizes on a gaas / algaas modulation - doped heterostructure .",
    "this is the first study of the impact of split gate dimensions using data obtained from a large number of split gates fabricated on a single chip and measured during one cool down .",
    "the array contains groups of devices , where the dimensions of each split gate in the group are the same , and dimensions are changed between groups .",
    "measuring groups in this way provides enough statistical information to determine typical device properties .",
    "our technique allows us to compare incremental changes in gate design .",
    "this is important in the context of device developement , for example if it is necessary to design a device with a specific set of operating parameters , or find ways of improving a particular design .",
    "the traditional approach to nanostructure measurement require many cool downs to build up the statistical information that we obtain in a single cool down .",
    "we systematically compare the accuracy of conductance quantization between split gates of different dimension , and find a rapid reduction in quality of quantization as gate length increases .",
    "we obtain average values of pinch off voltage and definition voltage as a function of gate length and width which show how the pinch off voltage occurs closer to zero for longer and narrower split gates , as expected from electrostatics @xcite . for longer gates",
    "the voltage at which the 1d channel is defined also occurs closer to zero , and the 1d subband spacing reduces .",
    "a key finding of this paper is that the background disorder potential is at least as important as the split gate dimension in governing the potential landscape in the 1d channel .",
    "this is shown in three separate ways .",
    "firstly , the spread in both the measured 1d subband spacing and the estimated 1d barrier curvature for split gates at fixed gate lengths exceed variations in the mean value of these parameters between devices of different length .",
    "secondly , the strength of coupling between the split gates and the 1d channel does not monotonically increase with device length .",
    "a monotonic increase is expected if one only considers the electric field generated by the gates themselves .",
    "thirdly , changes in the 1d barrier curvature from device to device  which indicates the length of the 1d channel  do not depend on split gate length .",
    "we also directly compare the 0.7 anomaly in devices of different gate length .",
    "this is possible since  for a non - interacting system  the shape of the conductance trace depends on @xmath3 .",
    "we use a technique developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to remove the trivial geometric dependence from the conductance data , leaving differences that are only due to electron interactions .",
    "our data are consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite in that the 0.7 anomaly occurs at lower conductance values for devices with a shallower longitudinal barrier .",
    "however , the present dataset is gathered from devices of different dimensions ( data in ref .",
    "@xcite are from lithographically identical gates ) . by obtaining the same result from devices with various dimensions",
    "we show that the electrostatic length of the 1d channel is the decisive factor governing the conductance of the 0.7 anomaly .",

    "@xcite an array of identical length split gates was measured in which differences in the electrostatic profile between devices arose only from variations in the background potential . in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) data from split gates of different length all follow the same trend line for a given @xmath93 .",
    "this implies that the profile of the longitudinal barrier  rather than the gate length  is the most significant factor governing the conductance value of the 0.7 anomaly .",
    "the data in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] are presented in a similar way to fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite for ease of comparison .",
    "we emphasize that these are entirely different datasets , from separate devices .",
    "the similarity arises because the same technique developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to analyze the 0.7 anomaly is applied here .",
    "the importance of device - specific confining potential has been highlighted in ref .",
    "@xcite , which summarizes numerous studies of the 0.7 anomaly as a function of carrier density .",
    "the conductance of the 0.7 anomaly has been seen to both increase and decrease as a function of carrier density .",
    "these conflicting trends likely arise due to the extreme sensitivity of the 0.7 anomaly to differences in the electrostatic potential between devices  @xcite .",
    "the trend in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) is also consistent with the split - gate length dependence reported in ref .",
    "the 0.7 anomaly occurred at lower values as gate length increased ( three devices @xmath108 0 , 0.5 and 2 @xmath8 m long were measured ) .",
    "a stronger link between the longitudinal profile and gate length may exist for devices measured in ref .",
    "@xcite because they are fabricated on an undoped heterostructure  @xcite , where the absence of dopants may lead to smaller variations in the background potential .",
    "calculations of the conductance transition between zero and @xmath97 using the inelastic scattering model plus the local density of states enhancement @xcite predict a lowering of the conductance in the sub open regime as @xmath109 decreases .",
    "these calculations are shown in fig .",
    "s14(b ) in supplementary material of ref .",
    "@xcite , and are in agreement with our data .",
    "unfortunately , our data do not allow us to distinguish between theories for the occurrence of the 0.7 anomaly since the same trend is predicted in both the spontaneous spin polarization @xcite and kondo scenarios @xcite ( this is discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the inelastic scattering scenario is the only theory for which detailed calculations have been performed as a function of @xmath109 .",
    "figure  [ fig5](d ) shows @xmath91 as a function of 1d subband spacing @xmath39 .",
    "there is a slight reduction of @xmath98 with increasing @xmath39 in the sub - open regime , although the trend is weak . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , a larger @xmath39 occurs for devices with a more negative pinch off voltage .",
    "this suggests a possible explanation for the trend in fig .",
    "[ fig5](d ) : the strength of transverse confinement is stronger for the devices with larger @xmath39 , leading to an increase of strength of electron interactions , thus affecting the conductance value of the 0.7 anomaly .",
    "this may be understood within the framework of the inelastic scattering model , which makes predictions of the effect of electron interaction strength on the conductance of the 0.7 anomaly .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "s14(c ) of supplementary material for ref .",
    "@xcite shows a reduction of the conductance in the sub - open regime with increasing interaction strength , for a constant barrier curvature . as a final point of interest ,",
    "the trends in figs .",
    "[ fig5](c ) and [ fig5](d ) do not depend on the split gate length , compatible with the inelastic scattering model which is based purely on the shape of the potential barrier .",
    "we have systematically studied the effect of changing split gate size on device behavior .",
    "this is achieved using a multiplexing technique which allows many nanostructure devices to be compared on a single cooldown .",
    "multiple devices of each size are measured , providing statistical information on the variance of conductance properties between individual designs . in total",
    ", we measured 95 split gates with 7 different length / width combinations .",
    "increasing the gate length and/or reducing the width moves the average voltage required to define a 1d channel and the pinch off voltage closer to zero .",
    "the 1d subband spacing also reduces for devices with longer gates .",
    "further , the percentage of devices displaying accurate quantization of conductance reduces dramatically as the area of the channel increases .",
    "the electrostatic environment in the 2deg is very influential on the 1d potential profile .",
    "the significance of the background potential is highlighted by three key results reported here .",
    "firstly , the spread in values of the 1d subband spacing and the 1d barrier curvature for a given gate length are as large as the overall variation in the average values of these properties over the range of gate lengths measured .",
    "secondly , the lever arm @xmath56 which depends on the coupling between the gate and the 1d channel does not continue to increase as a function of gate length beyond @xmath110 @xmath8 m , a deviation from the expected result .",
    "thirdly , the curvature of the longitudinal potential barrier estimated using a saddle - point model is not strongly related to gate length .",
    "these results imply that _ i _ ) gate size can not be relied upon as a good indicator of the length of the 1d channel , and _ ii _ ) the background disorder potential is at least as significant as gate size in determining the potential landscape in the 1d channel .    the 0.7 anomaly is compared between split gates of different length . the conductance value of the 0.7 anomaly reduces as the barrier curvature becomes shallower , rather than depending specifically on the split gate length .",
    "the particular confining potential in each device , and principally the barrier curvature , may be the primary factor governing the conductance of the 0.7 anomaly at a given temperature and magnetic field .",
    "this study has characterized split gates on a modulation doped gaas / algaas heterostructure . a potential avenue for future work is to perform measurements on undoped heterostructures where the absence of si donors results in a reduction of background disorder  @xcite , leading to more reproducible behavior both between split gate devices  @xcite and after thermal cycling  @xcite .",
    "measuring an array of devices on an undoped structure may also give insight on the degree to which disorder affects nanostructures fabricated on undoped heterostructures  @xcite .",
