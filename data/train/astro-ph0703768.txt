    "to study galaxy formation and evolution it is often helpful to imagine that galaxies are made up of a small number of separate components .",
    "surface photometry of galaxies provides a very simple way of parameterising these various components . by modelling the surface - brightness distribution of a galaxy and thereby parametrising the individual components , we obtain a common ground to measure , compare , and sort large samples of galaxies .",
    "owing to their flat geometry the random orientation of a specific galaxy disk provides us with different projected views of the , presumably , common underlying 3 dimensional distribution . in particular , one gets complementary views from observing face - on or edge - on galaxies . in the face - on view , one studies the radial distribution of the starlight discussing ,",
    "non - axisymmetric features such as bars , rings , or spiral arms . in the edge - on view on the other hand ,",
    "one is able to study the vertical distribution  disentangle thick disk , thin disk and stellar halos . due to a longer line - of - sight projection",
    ", the edge - on view allows in principle the exploration of the radial profile to larger distances .",
    "early on , from face - on galaxy observations , several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) noticed that the radial light distribution of stellar disks is well described by a simple exponential , albeit the lack of a clear physical explanation for this fact .",
    "later on , @xcite called these disks type  i  as opposed to some other galaxies called type  ii  showing a break in their radial profile with a downbending steeper outer region , or equivalently , a flatter inner region . using the edge - on view , @xcite discovered that the exponential decline does not continue to the last measured point , but is _ truncated _ after several radial scalelengths .",
    "afterwards , with the advent of ccd technology , several groups @xcite studied larger samples of edge - on galaxies to find out if and at what radius this truncation occurs .",
    "more recently , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have analysed surface brightness profiles of face - on to intermediate inclined galaxies and revised our view on disk truncations .",
    "they identified three basic classes of surface brightness profiles depending on the apparent break features or lack of them : 1 ) the well known type  i that has an exponential profile , with no break .",
    "2 ) type  ii with a ` downbending break ' .",
    "3 ) a completely new class , called type  iii , also described by a broken exponential but with an upbending profile beyond the break . in this view",
    "the _ classical truncations _ described initially in the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite are in fact part of a generalised freeman type  ii class @xcite . in this picture",
    "truncated galaxies show a surface brightness profile with a shallow inner and a steeper outer exponential region separated at a relatively well defined break radius .",
    "these results are in agreement with those reported by @xcite , who obtained deep photometry of three face - on galaxies and clearly demonstrated that the sharp cut - offs fitted to profiles of edge - on galaxies ( e.g. by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are in fact not complete but better described by a broken exponential .",
    "even before , @xcite and @xcite noted that for edge - on galaxies the surface brightness distribution does not disappear asymptotically ( ` vertically ' ) into the background noise .",
    "interestingly , @xcite find a similar broken exponential shape for many objects in their large sample of irregular galaxies .",
    "the redefinition of the truncation as a point at which the two exponential fits meet solves , among other things , the apparent contradiction between simulations by @xcite and the edge - on observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter authors find that ` truncations ' are as ` close ' as twice the radial scalelength from the centre in contradiction with the simulations . furthermore ,",
    "` early ' truncations ( at @xmath1 ) of edge - on galaxies have been always questioned by the ` face - on viewers ' , who had never observed a face - on galaxy with a sharp truncation at a distance of twice the scalelength . despite the line - of - sight enhancement of the surface brightness level in edge - on galaxies ,",
    "star counts in nearby galaxies are able to provide significantly deeper profiles with much higher s / n . using this completely independent method",
    ", @xcite followed the profile of the face - on galaxy m33 down to @xmath2 i- , which is currently unreachable with surface photometry .",
    "their result shows that the broken exponential description is valid down to the last bin above the noise level and an actual _ edge _ of the disk is not found , at least for this galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , there still seem to be some open issues for a complete reconciliation of the renewed face - on with the ` old ' edge - on view  @xcite as to provide a consistent picture of the three - dimensional structure , for example :    * is the broken exponential structure , now well observed for face - on galaxies , quantitatively consistent with the truncated profiles observed for edge - on galaxies ? * do we see a different kind of truncation in the deeper views provided by the edge - on galaxies ?",
    "* can we identify the edge - on counterparts of the three main types of surface brightness profiles ( type  i , type  ii , and type  iii ) observed for face - on galaxies by @xcite and @xcite ?",
    "* does the frequency of different profile classes found for the face - on galaxies match the edge - on results ? * why did the former edge - on surveys , with large and deep samples , not discover the new class of type  iii profiles ?    to answer these questions and disentangle the crucial problems with the line - of - sight integration ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we decided to deproject a sample of edge - on galaxies .",
    "this can only be done using some geometric assumption . here",
    "we choose the assumption of axial symmetry .",
    "this will allow us to gain insight into the three - dimensional galactic stellar disk structure by bringing together the classical face - on and edge - on views .",
    "the vertical structure may well be the key to understand the nature of the different breaks in the surface brightness profiles , by setting additional constraints on the various physical explanations put forward .",
    "for example , some recent star formation models @xcite are now able to produce the observed broken exponential structure , but , alternatively , @xcite also find downbending breaks using purely collisionless @xmath3-body simulations .",
    "once the nature of the galactic stellar disk is determined it will be fully justified to utilise these breaks for comparison of galaxies at various redshifts as done by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , and explain their appearance in cosmological simulations as shown by @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "[ data ] describes our sample selection and data . in [ method ]",
    "we introduce our method to deproject the edge - on galaxies .",
    "the results are given in [ results ] , we discuss them in [ discussion ] and conclude in [ conclusion ] . in [ comments ] we give detailed comments for all our galaxies and show in [ figures ] radial surface brightness profiles and isophote maps for all galaxies .",
    "all optical images used in this paper were taken as part of a phd study on the radial structure of galactic stellar disks by @xcite .",
    "originally , the disk galaxies ( @xmath4 ) were chosen according to the allocated observing time , the observatory ( north / south ) , and the available fov ( @xmath5 ) to meet the following morphological selection criteria verified by using images from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) : 1 ) the galaxies are edge - on with @xmath6 .",

    "we mask all the foreground stars and the background galaxies . to do this semi - automatically",
    ", we use sextractor @xcite to create an object catalogue . depending on the measured ellipticity and the provided star / galaxy classifier we separated stars from galaxies , which in turn get assigned circular masks with radii depending on their measured flux .",
    "the output is a ds9 region file which is overlayed on the galaxy image and visually inspected for each of the masked objects . for highly elliptical background galaxies the mask",
    "is changed to an ellipse .",
    "in addition we have to adapt the radii of the masks .",
    "typically one opts for a conservative masking ( prefer to mask more than necessary and leave ` larger holes ' ) to make sure that all non - galaxy features are removed",
    ".    however , since our deprojection method can not deal with masked areas ( actual holes ) we have to interpolate the flux across our mask . by doing this ,",
    "one is forced to chose the mask radius as small as possible in order to not introduce too much unwanted structure .",
    "this approach clearly leaves residuals on the masked , interpolated image which will be discussed later ( [ asymmetries ] ) . in a second step the galaxy image",
    "is rotated to align the galactic plane parallel to the major axis using the smallest angle of rotation according to their true position on the sky ( chip ) .",
    "the rotation and centering is done by blinking the adjacent sides and minimising the difference by eye .",
    "depending on the intrinsic symmetry this can be done down to an accuracy of @xmath46 .",
    "the third step is to cut the galaxy into 4-quadrants and average them .",
    "this procedure increases the s / n and minimises the residuals from the interpolated , masked regions and gives a more regular averaged galaxy .",
    "the influence of the dustlane and intrinsic asymmetries will be discussed later ( [ asymmetries ] ) .",
    "the final step is smoothing the image .",
    "since our deprojection code only handles one radial cut at a time , we choose the kernel size for the gaussian smoothing to match the vertical increment between successive deprojections in order to get fully independent cuts but using all available rows .",
    "in this section we describe and test the method used to recover the 3d structure of the available disk galaxies .",
    "we start with describing the deprojection algorithm ( [ deprojmethod ] ) and discuss the noise properties of the reconstructed 3d distribution , especially after the original image has been smoothed with a gaussian kernel ( [ noise ] ) . to further reduce the noise we applied an additional denoising ( [ denoise ] ) . in [ shape ]",
    "we discuss in detail our choice of fitting function for the radial surface brightness distribution .",
    "then we describe how the radial profiles of the recovered distribution for a given @xmath47 are actually fitted ( [ fitting ] ) . in [ tests ] we apply the method and the fitting procedure on a large sample of artificial galaxy images in order to test the method s ability to recover the underlying 3d distribution . in this set of artificial images",
    "the influence of the inclination of the galaxy and the existence of dust on the recovery of the 3d distribution is tested . finally , we estimate the effects of our image preparation on the resulting profiles using real galaxies in [ asymmetries ] .",
    "the deprojection of axially symmetric quantities is a classical problem in astronomy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is considered for determining the 3d stellar orbit structure in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in determining cluster 3d structure from x - ray observations @xcite and more generally from x - ray , sunyaev - zeldovich and cluster weak - lensing data @xcite . in the case of edge - on galaxies ,",
    "@xcite have applied an inversion method to obtain deprojected profiles before , but without studying a dependence with the vertical distance from the plane . here",
    "we apply a simple analytical method that employs the , so called , fourier slice theorem in order to recover the intrinsic 3d stellar distribution from our sample of high quality 2d edge - on disk galaxy images .",
    "the disk galaxy images are deprojected as follows .",
    "we adopt the convention that bold - face symbols denote 3d quantities ( e.g. , @xmath48 ) .",
    "let the observer s coordinate system be defined with the cartesian axes @xmath49 , with the @xmath50 axis aligned with the line - of - sight .",
    "the disk galaxy axis of symmetry lies along the @xmath47-axis which is perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "let @xmath51 denote a projected quantity ( image ) of the source function @xmath52 .",

    "\\label{eqn : simagereln } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that functions marked with  @xmath54  are in fourier space .",
    "this relation could be easily understood since the galaxy has a rotational symmetry , @xmath55 and its fourier transform is @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the deprojection is then obtained by inverse fourier transform of @xmath58 and replacing @xmath59 with @xmath60 , namely by using the following equation : @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the zero order bessel function .",
    "notice that for a specific radial slice , i.e. , a cut at a given @xmath63 and parallel to the major axis , the integral  ( [ eqn : fouriersliceeqn ] ) can be written simply as , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the fourier transform over the image x - direction .",
    "this way of writing the equation enables us to easily deproject certain radial slices of the image , or collapsing the whole z - direction of the image to recreate the equivalent of a face - on view of the galaxy .    in principle , it is easy to obtain an equation similar to  ( [ eqn : fouriersliceeqn ] ) for the general case of a disk with an arbitrary inclination angle .",
    "however , one can show that for such cases there is a cone in k - space inside which there is no information on the 3d structure in the image .",
    "the general case is beyond the scope of this paper and is not needed for the range of inclinations we restrict our selves to i.e. , to @xmath6(see section  [ tests ] ) .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can show that the fourier slice theorem approach for inverting edge - on galaxies is actually another way of writing the inverse abel transform @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the fourier space language here is that it avoids taking direct derivatives of noisy data , hence , making the inversion more stable .",
    "the applied fast fourier transform ( fft ) assumes periodic boundary conditions which has to be satisfied by our images .",
    "therefore , one has to pad the image with at least twice the number of the image pixels along each axis .",
    "however , since fft of sharp transitions will give a strong aliasing signal in the deprojected slice , we do not apply zero padding .",
    "rather we padded the image with white noise background with the same rms as the noise in the observed image .",
    "the residual small differences at the edge changing from the artificial white noise to the actual noise in the background of the image is washed out by the final wavelet denoising and gaussian smoothing of the image ( see  [ noise ] and [ denoise ] ) .",
    "further tests with more careful tapering of the image s edge with a fermi - dirac function without adding noise showed that there is no significant influence on the deprojected profiles .",
    "as a zero - order test , we deproject the image of ngc5981 and then reproject it back .",
    "the result is that we obtain profiles that are identical to those of the original image ( [ deprep ] ) down to @xmath66 error level .",
    "most of this error actually comes from the reprojection  not the deprojection  procedure .",
    "the reason is simply that the deprojection is a differential quantity that depends on the intensity of the image at a given radius , whereas the reprojection is an integration procedure that will depend on the intensity of galaxy at every radius including radii beyond those explored in the image ( i.e. , after the noise dominates over the signal . )",
    "a more thorough testing of the method in which we compare the deprojected 3d structure with the original one will be presented in [ tests ] .",
    ", width=340 ]      to explore the noise properties , let us suppose that the image only contains white noise , with rms @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the noise correlation function in the deprojected image is given by @xmath69 not surprisingly , the high frequency components dominate and hence some smoothing must be employed .",
    "the analytic nature of the correlation matrix is an attractive feature of the method .",
    "another nice feature of the method is that any isotropic smoothing function applied to the image will depend only on the modulus of the radial wavevector , @xmath70 , in the deprojection .",
    "this can easily be seen from the previous equations .",
    "a simple and practical gaussian smoothing filter , with smoothing scale @xmath71 , gives an auto - correlation of the noise of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a hyper - geometric function .",
    "this has a particularly simple asymptotic form ,    @xmath74    since we are interested in the large scale features of the reconstruction a gaussian smoothing is applied on the image .",
    "the choice of the fwhm of the smoothing kernel is discussed in  [ prepa ] .    despite these simple analytic features of the noise properties",
    ", we sample the noise properties of the smoothed 3d structure created by the method with deprojecting noisy slices of the image ( with a given z well outside the galaxy ) . for each image",
    "we deproject some 10 randomly selected lines , average their rms and use that as our noise estimate .",
    "the profile of the reconstructed noise rms is shown in every set of reconstructed profiles ( see [ dprofpfits ] ) .",
    "the noise is dominated not by pixel to pixel variations , but by any residual large scale asymmetries in the background as well as residuals from the masking ( [ prepa ] ) .",
    "the latter cause the somewhat bumpy structure of the resulting deprojected profiles ( see [ dprofpfits ] ) .",
    "the seeing acts in effect as an additional gaussian smoothing of the image .",
    "this type of smoothing flattens the brightness profile around the center but has very little influence on the scalelength measurements .      in order to reduce the apparent bumpy structures along the radial profiles we apply an extra denoising algorithm based on wavelet expansion .",
    "the employment of this algorithm is not necessary and we tested that it does not change the quantitative results of the deprojection in any significant way , it however reduces the apparent `` bumpiness '' in the radial profiles .",
    "the denoising scheme adopted here follows the method proposed by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where the wavelet coefficients are reduce with a constant equal to the rms of the white noise .",
    "this procedure is known as the soft thresholding of wavelet coefficients .",
    "the wavelet functions used here are the daubechies discrete wavelets @xcite with 12 parameters ( daub12 ) .",
    "the recent studies of profile shapes for face - on disk galaxies @xcite and irregular galaxies @xcite suggest that the _ broken exponential _ is a good fitting function for the radial light distribution ( [ introduction ] ) .",
    "technically , this results in a discontinuity between the inner and outer slope , which is unphysical and of course not implied .",
    "@xcite find an extended _ transition or break region _",
    ", which is not as sharp as measured before ( by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from their sample only a few clean and undisturbed truncated cases ( ngc5300 or ngc7437 ) exhibit a very sharp transition between the inner and outer disk region .",
    "most often their type  ii breaks appear with a more gradual transition zone of a size up to @xmath75kpc . despite the fact that the exponential function in itself has no clear physical explanation , the broken",
    "exponential is a reasonable fitting function that describes the shape of the profiles in a simple and uniform way .",
    "the key point of this description is that the _ outer disks _ of truncated galaxies  regardless of any transition zone and the exact shape of the outer profile  makes up a significant fraction of the physical size of the their stellar disks . for example , the ratio between the inner and the outer disk is typically 2 to 1 in radius @xcite , therefore in terms of area the outer disk is even slightly larger . in some cases",
    "authors ignore the outer region altogether ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and use an exponential with a sharp _ cut - off _ as their fitting function of choice . however , this is not the case for edge - on galaxies in general as clearly apparent from the examination of the radial profiles of , ngc5907 in @xcite or ic4393 in @xcite .",
    "we see the same for several galaxies used in our study . for example , the major axis profiles of eso380 - 019 , eso404 - 018 , ngc 5981 , ugc10459 , and ngc522 ( see [ mapspprofs ] in [ figures ] ) are obviously better described by a broken exponential fit @xcite .",
    "many further examples in the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the broken exponential shape is indeed a very good fitting function even for edge - on galaxies .",
    "however , we should mention that some authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , still prefer the description of a smooth , but complete truncation .",
    "to summarise , since the profiles of face - on galaxies are well parameterised by a broken exponential model , and those of edge - on galaxies seem to be , it is useful to apply the same parametrisation for the profiles of the edge - on galaxies studied here .      in order to quantify the behaviour of the recovered 3d stellar distribution of the galaxies",
    ", we fit the deprojected radial profiles , for a given @xmath47 , with a simple broken exponential function of the form    @xmath76    in principle , the model includes 5 free parameters , the inner and outer scalelengths @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the inner and outer central surface brightnesses , @xmath79 and @xmath80 and the location of the break radius , @xmath81 , which marks the boundary between the inner and outer regions .",
    "however by using the downhill simplex method @xcite with initial starting values of only the scalelength and central brightness parameters we avoid using the break radius as a free parameter .",
    "this is achieved by deciding _",
    "a - priory _ that the inner slope is either shallower or steeper than the outer one .",
    "this enables the break radius to be determined by the crossing point of two exponential fits found by the algorithm .",
    "we find that in all cases , except ngc1596 , the inner profile is shallower than the outer profile .",
    "in addition , when the ratio between the two fitted radial scalelengths is about @xmath82 , we fit it with a single exponential profile of the form @xmath83 . in order to avoid including",
    "the bulge and/or bar regions in the fitting procedure , i.e. , avoid a detailed bulge to disk decomposition , we used the `` marking the disk '' method with fixed inner , @xmath84 , and outer , @xmath85 , boundaries ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the inner boundary is chosen to exclude the region that is obviously dominated by the bulge plus bar ( shoulder ) component .",
    "the outer boundary is set at the point at which the surface brightness profile is comparable to the noise level ( see [ noise ] ) . in the case of an extended bump clearly visible in the profile , caused for example by a residual from the masking ,",
    "the boundary is moved further inside .",
    "sometimes a sharp rise or drop appears beyond the outer boundary of the recovered profiles ( see , the face - on equivalent profiles of ic4871 or ngc5290 r - band in [ dprofpfits ] ) .",
    "this is caused by the fast fourier transform ( fft ) operation used in the method .",
    "the fft procedure requires periodic boundary conditions . to avoid contamination of the profile at hand by these conditions we increase the size of the image by a certain factor .",
    "however , this periodicity still shows up in the noise dominated regions and sometimes close enough to , but never within , the region of interest .",
    "the five starting values for the downhill simplex minimisation are obtained by a single exponential fit to the inner or outer region with an approximate break radius for each galaxy .        to study the influence of the dust and possible non-@xmath86 inclination on the scalelength measurements in our deprojected profiles we used a grid of 96 mock images ( 400x400 pixels ) kindly provided by simone bianchi . using a monte carlo radiative transfer method @xcite , he calculated single disk models at a range of edge - on inclinations ( @xmath87 ) with different input parameters for the stellar and dust distribution .",
    "a similar approach is adopted by @xcite to measure the influence of dust and inclination for less inclined galaxies .",
    "the chosen inclination angles are @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the stellar disk is a 3d single disk model with exponential profiles both along the radial and vertical direction .",
    "the radial scalelength is @xmath94 pix , and the vertical scaleheight is @xmath95 .",
    "the only parameter of the stellar distribution that is varied is the position of an outer ( sharp ) truncation of the light distribution .",
    "the truncation parameter has 4 values , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the first value mimics an infinite exponential profile , and the other three values represent a long truncated , an intermediate truncated , and a short truncated stellar disk . for the dust distribution a set of four different cases with increasing influence on the measured r - band light distribution are adopted .",
    "the parameters for these cases are within the range measured by @xcite .",
    "the first case is a dust free ( transparent ) model which we use as our reference case .",
    "the second case , which we call the `` best case '' , has the following dust parameters : @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 . here",
    "@xmath103 is the r - band optical depth , @xmath104 is the dust scalelength , @xmath105 is the dust vertical scaleheight and @xmath63 is the stellar scaleheight .",
    "the parameters of the third case , called the `` intermediate case '' , are @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108",
    ". finally , the parameters of the fourth case , which we call the `` worst case '' are @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "the dust disk is truncated at the same radius as that of the stars .",
    "in addition , we have tried several other cases with variable dust truncations , however those did not show any significant difference with respect to the ones presented here .",
    "the number of images used to test the dust and inclination influence on the reconstruction is then doubled ( except in the 90@xmath112 cases ) by using two different methods of symmetrising the far and near side of the galaxy , insofar as the dustlanes are concerned . in the first case",
    "we average all four quadrants , whereas in the second we only average over the two far side quadrants which have less dust influence and ignore the two near side quadrants with the dust lane .",
    "the artificial images are 3x3 pixels carbox smoothed .",
    "the deprojection is carried out on the vertically integrated profile , hereafter , the face - on - equivalent view , as well as on the major axis and two higher cuts at @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "since the input profile in this case is sharply truncated , we apply only simple exponential radial fits ranging from the center to 3 times the radial scalelength , except for the short truncated disk where we go out to one scalelength . from these fits",
    "we obtain the scalelength and central surface brightness of the deprojected 3d distribution .      to visualise the influence of the various dust distributions we plotted the relative deviation in the recovered scalelength as a function of the inclination angle ( [ dustfit ] ) .",
    "here the relative deviation is defined explicitly as @xmath115 .    from [ dustfit ] , it is obvious that using only the two dust - free quadrants , shown as dashed - crossed lines , improves the quality of the fit .",
    "however , above @xmath116 the gain is only minimal and countered by the advantages of an increased s / n  especially important to reach large vertical distances  and by minimising the residuals from masked objects .",
    "therefore , for the image preparation of the real data we average over all four quadrants , even in the clear presence of dustlanes .    as expected our deprojected , face - on - equivalent , scalelengths are very close to the true , 3d input scalelength in the absence of dust .",
    "there is almost no influence of the non edge - on geometry ( down to @xmath88 ) of the actual model galaxy which we treat in our deprojection to be always at @xmath93 .",
    "for the model galaxies with dust , we see that the error on the scalelength is almost always systematically smaller for galaxies with increasing deviation from the perfect edge - on geometry .",
    "we also notice , from the dust - free case , that for the short - truncated disk the deprojection improves the fits quite noticeably , since it disentangles the truncated part of the profile and avoids fitting for it , as is the case with the projected edge - on view . for the latter we know that they result , slightly depending on the region used for fitting , in a systematic overestimation of the scalelength in the range of @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "however , we note that our face - on - equivalent scalelengths are still systematically overestimated by typically , @xmath118 due to neglecting the existence of the dust component .",
    "naturally the effect is far the worse on the individually deprojected major axes ( overestimated by more than 50% ) , which probably make only sense for dust - deficient 0 galaxies or in the dust - reduced nir bands .",
    "however , the narrowness of the dustlane works in our advantage , so that above @xmath119 times the vertical scaleheight the error in the measured scalelength already drops to less than @xmath120 ( for @xmath121 ) .",
    "this means the scalelength measured on the individually deprojected higher vertical cuts are much better .",
    "the discussion of the results that we obtain from the observed galaxies takes the effects of the dust and inclination , that we learned from this section , into account .",
    "_ dustlanes : _ in the last section we have estimated the influence of the dust on the measured flattening of the inner scalelength using our artificial images . aside from a solely quantitative correction to be made to the measured scalelength in this case , one could argue that the dust in addition might be responsible for the observed broken exponential structure . in this picture",
    "the break would correspond to the point at which the dust lane becomes less important .",
    "however , in almost all cases the location of the break does not coincide with the , admittedly difficult to estimate , location of the visible end of the dustlane on the image .",
    "an obvious exception is the major axis profile ( @xmath122 ) of ngc3390 where the dustlane extends out to @xmath123 and indeed causes an apparent break feature at this point ( see [ dprofpfits ] ) , hence it is excluded from the fit . in addition , we still find profiles showing a broken exponential structure at more than two times the stellar scaleheight above the disk , where the effect of the dustlane is minimal .",
    "also ngc4179 does show a break , but has no dustlane at all .",
    "furthermore , if one assumes that the outer slope is the intrinsic , dustfree slope , the extrapolation into the center will in almost all cases come up too high ( much brighter than the bulge peak ) .",
    "this would require far too much dust in these galaxies .",
    "therefore , the dust quantitatively affects the measured inner scalelengths , however , is not responsible for the break in the profiles ( [ asym ] ) .",
    "_ intrinsic small scale asymmetries : _ for real galaxies the residuals from masked objects will certainly affect the recovered profile .",
    "the problem is ostensibly aggravated by the averaging process of the four quadrants ( [ prepa ] ) , which will mirror any residual on one , to all other sides .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that our deprojection method can not deal with ` holes ' , so we have to somehow fill these masked regions . for example , in the case of ngc5981 the extended companion superimposed on the upper left side of the bulge could be well traced in the contour lines of the averaged galaxy image ( see [ prepima ] ) . under these worst case circumstances we made sure that this area is excluded from our fitting region . in the latter case we did not fit beyond @xmath124 .",
    "in addition , the final position of the break radius is strongly affected by the small scale asymmetries ( star - forming regions , dust concentrations , residuals from masked objects ) which vary in each of the vertical profiles . whereas this only slightly affects the measured scalelength ,",
    "the meeting point of the two exponential fits ( break point ) is more susceptible to such variations . _",
    "large scale asymmetries :",
    "_ we do not expect significant large scale asymmetries in our galaxies , since the input sample is morphologically selected to be symmetric .",
    "ngc5981 , which is asymmetric relative to the rest of the sample , is a good test case to estimate the effect of averaging quadrants from both sides .",
    "the asymmetry is clearly seen in the radial profiles ( [ mapspprofs ] ) .",
    "the outer slope of the broken exponential fit is significantly shallower on the nw(right)-side , where also the contour map is more extended .",
    "fitting only a mean quadrant obtained from the nw(right)- or se(left)-side of the galaxy separately ( [ asym ] ) we find differences of @xmath125% for the scalelengths of the inner region . in the outer disk ( beyond the break )",
    "the differences are clearly larger , 40% on the major axis , due to the stronger asymmetry in the outer disk .",
    "however , both sides are equally well fit with the broken exponential function , so we do not introduce a bias on the validity of the applied fitting function by averaging the two sides .",
    "now we move on to present the results obtained by applying the deprojection method on our observed edge - on galaxies . again here we first apply the method on the vertically integrated image .",
    "this results in a profile that is equivalent to the one obtained from azimuthal averaging , for example by fits with concentric ellipses , of face - on galaxies .",
    "a direct comparison between the two views ( see [ deprojmethod ] ) is carried out in [ faceon ] .",
    "furthermore , we deproject a number of vertical slices to explore the existence and properties of , for example , a thick disk component . here",
    "the following questions are addressed : does the inner slope flattens with increasing @xmath47 , as expected for some thick disk models ? does the break radius , if present , vary significantly with @xmath47 ? finally , how does the vertical distribution of the outer disk , beyond the break point , changes with @xmath47 ?",
    "these question are addressed in [ vertical ] .",
    "the radial profiles obtained from deprojecting all the galaxies in the sample , together with the best fit broken exponential models are shown in [ dprofpfits ] .",

    ", we have to account for the effect of dust on the inner scalelength . in [ tests ] we have shown that in the case of dusty edge - on galaxies the resulting scalelengths are typically 20% overestimated ( see [ dustfit ] ) .",
    "factoring this correction in one obtains a break - radius in the range of @xmath135 , which matches the range given by @xcite .    the surface brightness at the break radius ranges from 21.9 to 26.3 r- , which also matches the full range for face - on galaxies given by @xcite . here",

    "first we concentrate on the inner disk region , i.e. , the region in between the bulge / bar component and the location of the break . for almost all of the late - type galaxies",
    "( sbc and later , for details see [ comments ] ) we find an increase in the measured scalelength with the distance from the plane .",
    "the increase , at @xmath137 , is typically of the order of about @xmath138% , relative to the major axis scalelength ( see upper panel of [ hvsz ] ) . since we know that the omnipresence of dust extinction will mostly affect the major axis profiles , as evident from the systematic flattening one sees for our artificial galaxies ( [ dustfit ] ) , our measurements of the increase in scalelength in the optical , starting at the major axis , are only lower limits .",
    "consequently , the major axis slope for four galaxies is indeed observed to be flatter than that obtained from adjacent @xmath47 cuts ( [ hvsz ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that this type of flattening towards the midplane , which is for r - band images well explained by the dust effect , is also present at the level of approximately @xmath139 in our -band image ( ngc5290 ) .",

    "this indicates an extreme flattening of the profile towards larger distances from the plane .",
    "again , the dust , well known for flattening surface brightness profiles , can not be responsible here since it is concentrated in the plane .",
    "this could be regarded as a weakening of the truncation with increasing distance from the plane ( see [ hinvshout ] ) .    ) from the plane normalised to the scaleheight ( @xmath141 ) .",

    "[ hinvshout],width=222 ]      the position of the break radius as a function of vertical distance from the plane ( @xmath47 ) is another constraint that any theory that might explain the truncation phenomenon should satisfy .",
    "an inspection of the location of the break radius from the deprojected profiles ( [ dprofpfits ] ) shows that this location does not change significantly as a function of @xmath47 in the first two to three @xmath47-slices . for the more distant @xmath47-slices the slopes of the inner and outer regions become closer , due the more substantial flattening in the outer disk , which makes it harder to confidently determine the location of the break radius .",
    "a clear demonstration of this is when the inner and outer slopes are very close , in such a case the presence of any genuine small scale structure in the image renders the location of the crossing point very uncertain .",
    "this is even more severe when the broken exponential model does not provide a good description of the data , e.g. , when the break region is clearly extended ( eso380 - 019 or eso404 - 018 ) .",
    "resorting to the nir image or concentrating on the smooth 0 galaxies in our sample , in which the substructure ( star - forming region or dust patches ) are less prominent , does not improve the matter because for these galaxies , as with the other , the flattening of the outer disk dominates the uncertainty in the location of the crossing point .    to summarise , based on the first 2 to 3 vertical slices , the current data suggest that the location of the break radius for all our galaxies is consistent with being constant .",
    "* profile classification *    in our pilot sample of edge - on galaxies we do indeed find the same three main types of surface brightness profiles as classified by @xcite and @xcite from their analysis of face - on galaxy images .",

    "the break seems to be at a slightly lower than usual surface brightness , albeit at a typical distance from the center .",
    "however , this is also the galaxy with the value of the lowest central surface brightness .",
    "hence , similar to @xcite , we still can not disentangle which of the two statements is correct : the surface brightness at the break radius is constant , or it is coupled to the central surface brightness .",

    "it is interesting to note that in this case the profiles of the individual cuts , close to the major axis but uninfluenced by the dustlane , show some indication of being better described by a broken exponential structure .",
    "therefore , the vertical integration in this case may obscure the existence of a break close to the plane .",
    "this is clearly caused by the lack of an apparent break in the vertical slices at larger vertical height above the midplane .",
    "this might explain the high frequency of not - truncated disks seen in the early - type face - on galaxy sample of @xcite . despite the discussion above about the general agreement between the edge - on and face - on classifications , an edge - on counterpart of the not - truncated , type  i , late - type galaxies ( e.g. , the face - on ngc2776 by * ? ? ?",

    "these galaxies are ngc4762 studied by several groups @xcite , ngc4452 shown by @xcite and ngc4696c from @xcite . for face - on galaxies , @xcite differentiate between two different types of type  iii profiles .",

    "any bulge component would have to have an unlikely , extremely high , axis ratio ( [ comments ] ) . in this case , the observed outer envelope is therefore much better explained by interaction as recently supported by @xcite . *",
    "inner disk *    almost all of the analysed profiles exhibit an increase of the radial scalelength with increasing distance from the plane . notwithstanding",
    "the lack of completeness in our sample , this finding could support the notion of _ ubiquitous thick disks _ as proposed by @xcite , where these thick disks have to have a systematically larger scalelength , compared to the thin disk .",
    "however , in the absence of a consistent two disk fit to the data at all radii the thick disk model is not the only option .",
    "instead one can interpret the increase in the radial scalelength merely as a result either of a radially flattened component above the inner disk or a flattening of the inner disk itself .",
    "for example , in the case of the late - type ( scd ) galaxy fgc2339 , the whole inner disk region is dominated by a ring- or bar - like structure in the midplane which also alters the shape of the disk above / below the plane over the entire measured vertical extent . *",
    "outer disk * in order to examine what could lead to the observed flattening of the outer disk profile , we invoke several 3 dimensional ( 3d ) toy models .",
    "these 3d models are generated by combining separate components , e.g. , a truncated thin disk plus a truncated thick disk .",
    "the resultant structures are qualitatively compared to those reconstructed from the data .",
    "it is important to emphasise here that no attempt is made to fit the data to these models , rather the intention is to explore whether these toy models could generically reproduce the increased flattening seen in the data",
    ". the 3d profiles of the models are shown in [ toymodels ] . to highlight the flattening in these models",
    "we fit broken exponential profiles with the same fitting routine used for the real galaxies ( [ fitting ] ) .",
    "for example the upper - left panel ( 1 ) of [ toymodels ] shows a single broken exponential disk model .",
    "this type of models does not show any flattening in the reconstructed scalelengths and , therefore , is not favoured by our data .",
    "_ could we be seeing de vaucouleurs @xmath147 bulges ? _ @xcite have shown that a thin disk plus a @xmath147 bulge can mimic the shape of the isophotes of a thin disk plus thick disk model ( without bulge ) down to a surface brightness level of about @xmath148 .",
    "furthermore , this combination can even produce some flattening of the radial profiles with increasing vertical height beyond the break radius as seen in our models .",
    "having said that however , there are strong arguments against explaining the observed flattening with a spherical power law bulge component .",
    "first , in a sample of 19 early - type galaxies ( s0-sbc ) @xcite find that none of the bulges have a @xmath147 behaviour .",
    "most of their bulges are better fit with exponentials which are not expected to dominate the radial profiles at large distances .",
    "therefore , it is statistically unlikely to attribute the flattening in the outer disk in most of our late - type edge - on galaxies to a spherical bulge component .",
    "second , the observed shape of the outer contours in all the cases studied here appear too much disk - like to be caused by a spheroid ( see [ mapspprofs ] and [ contour ] ) .",
    "third , it is almost impossible to create a @xmath147 bulge which will leave the high s / n major axis profile purely exponential down to the last measured point , but will dominate the radial profile at larger vertical heights above the plane , and doing this all without being clearly visible in a contour map . in conclusion , since there is no clear sign of a de vaucouleurs @xmath147 in any of the observed images whereas the outer disk flattening is found in the majority of galaxies in the sample , the answer to the question posed here is , most probably : no .",
    "_ does a thin plus thick disk combination produce the increased flattening beyond the break ? _ if one assumes that the thick disk scalelength is in general larger than the thin disk scalelength , the increase in scalelength with @xmath47-height in the inner disk will be always present . however , there are various possibilities for producing the extended flattening in the outer disk beyond the break with thin plus thick disk models .",
    "the exact shape of the flattening critically depends on the , unknown , outer disk properties of the thick disk .",
    "if , for example , we assume the thick disk to be not - truncated , we are still able to produce some flattening beyond the break ( see panel ( 2 ) of [ toymodels ] )",
    ". however , depending on the surface brightness limit the not - truncated thick disk will become visible at large radii .",
    "this could be an explanation for some of the very few type  ii + iii  mixed classifications found for late - type galaxies by @xcite .",
    "these galaxies show two breaks in their face - on surface brightness profile .",
    "the first is downbending in the inner region , while the other is upbending in the very outer region .",
    "however , none of our edge - on sample galaxies shows this behaviour . by adding a truncation to the thick disk one can produce a wide variety of broken exponential structures depending , for example , on the ratio of inner to outer disk scalelength ( ) .",
    "models with unequal thin and thick disk truncation radii provide even more choice to fit the data . in conclusion , the answer to the question posed here is : yes . however , the degree of flattening will depend on the details of the 3d model .",
    "_ could the flattening be explained by intrinsic flaring of the stellar disk ? _    to produce an increased flattening in the outer - disk one can invoke models with intrinsic flaring ",
    "similar to those used for the milky way ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  that starts beyond the break radius . in the edge - on view",
    ", the contour map of the observed galaxy provides a strong constraint on the degree of flaring .",
    "the lower - panel of [ contour ] shows three different radially broken exponential single disk models with flaring factors or @xmath149 between the solar radius and 25kpc .",
    "] of @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath149 .",
    "if the flaring factor is chosen to be too large the resulting contour map will blow up in the outer parts , a behaviour that is neither observed in any of our sample galaxies nor in the much larger sample of @xcite .",
    "_ lower panel : _ three combination of a the same thin disk and a thick disk , where the thick disk scaleheight grows ( flares ) between the break radius ( ) and three times with an increasing factor _ ( solid , dashed , dotted lines)_. , title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]   bulge . _ lower panel : _ three combination of a the same thin disk and a thick disk , where the thick disk scaleheight grows ( flares ) between the break radius ( ) and three times with an increasing factor _",
    "( solid , dashed , dotted lines)_. , title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    in general , it seems that a strong flaring of the stellar disk is rarely observed . in addition , in the few reported cases it appears to be rather associated with type  iii profiles , ngc4762 @xcite , and not with type  ii as discussed here .    as shown in the panel ( 3 ) of [ toymodels ] , flaring of a single disk beyond the break radius does not always produce the right amount of flattening if compared to our observations . a more promising attempt to apply flaring",
    "is obtained by allowing only the thick disk component to flare beyond the break radius ( see panel ( 4 ) of [ toymodels ] ) .",
    "this approach could help in cases where the inner disk indicates only a very small value for the ratio of thin to thick disk scalelength .",
    "the flaring is then needed to reproduce the observed significant difference of the outer scalelength on the major axis compared to high above the plane .",
    "a flaring of the thick disk is also proposed by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for our milky way from star - count studies",
    ". this flaring would account for the observed variable scaleheight with different direction of the analysed fields .",
    "it is clear that the data can in principle discriminate between possible 3d models , as each will produce different features in the reconstructed profiles .",
    "however , we make no such attempt in this paper except to point out the different possibilities .",
    "* break radius * as we have shown earlier , the location of the break - radius in the current sample is found to be consistent with being height independent . in light of the enhanced flattening of the outer disk relative to the inner disk ,",
    "the determination of the break radius at large vertical cuts is uncertain and more accurate modelling could reveal significant variation in its location towards the larger distance from the major axis .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to point out that if such a finding is supported by more data , it could have far reaching implications on theories that attempt to understand how the thin and thick disk are assembled .",
    "as such a theory should explain how potentially distinct components of the disk `` coordinate '' the location of their break radii .",
    "this paper has presented a new algorithm for reconstructing the intrinsic 3d structure of galactic disks seen edge - on .",
    "the algorithm assumes axial - symmetry and utilises the so - called fourier slice theorem which in the case of edge - on galaxies is equivalent to an inverse abel - transform .",
    "the algorithm is applied to a pilot set of 12 edge - on galaxy images , drawn from a parent sample of 72 galaxies , to obtain face - on - equivalent radial surface brightness profiles , and reconstruct the radial profiles along several vertical cuts , including the major axis . comparing the results obtained from the face - on - equivalent profiles with those measured from `` real '' face - on samples we reach several conclusion .",
    "the first , and probably most important , conclusion is that we find in the current edge - on sample at least one example for each of the three basic profile types found in face - on samples : no break , upbending break , and downbending break @xcite . despite this agreement , our morphologically selected parent sample @xcite ,",
    "choosing undisturbed and prototypical disk galaxies , clearly favours late - type galaxies with class type  ii profiles , downbending breaks .",
    "this might be due to a connection between certain profile types and distinct vertical structures .",
    "for example , if late - type type  iii galaxies are connected to interaction and/or merging processes , they would probably be excluded from edge - on samples . in other words",
    ", they would exhibit distortions , lopsidedness , or warping , which are all prominent in the edge - on view .",
    "although our parent sample is not unbiased in this sense , our results do show that the parameters for the downbending breaks of the face - on - equivalent profiles obtained from our edge - on galaxies are consistent with those seen in face - on samples .",
    "this implies that truncated profiles of galaxies are independent of geometry and there is no distinction in this regard between edge - on and face - on studies . in this paper",
    "we have been able to study , for the first time , the deprojected radial profiles as a function of vertical height above the plane , which is only possible to explore with edge - on galaxies .",
    "hence , this approach provides a unique opportunity to give additional constraints on theories explaining the origin of the various types of observed profiles in the context of disk formation and evolution . in this context",
    ", we find a generic flattening of the observed profiles in the inner disk region with increasing distance from the plane , which can not be explained by dust extinction .",
    "this implies a more complex vertical structure in the inner region than a single disk .",
    "it is possible to explain this flattening by introducing a thick disk with systematically larger scalelength compared to that of its host thin disk . in the outer disk , beyond the break radius",
    ", we find an enhanced flattening of the deprojected profiles , which again sets strong constraints on theories that attempt to explain the observed broken exponential structures .",
    "using some toy models we conclude that thin plus thick disk combinations are , in principle , able to explain the observed structures .",
    "however , the details of this combination depend on the exact shape of the outer region of the thick disk .",
    "for example , a thick disk without truncation will exhibit less flattening in the outer disk than a thick disk with truncation .",
    "so far our data does not allow us to decide if thick disks are in general truncated or not .",
    "it remains unclear whether one can fine tune a simple model with broken exponential thin plus thick disks in order to explain the observed brightness distribution .",
    "in addition , we find that the location of the break radius does not change significantly as a function of @xmath47 in the first two to three @xmath47-slices .",
    "unfortunately the flattening of the radial profile beyond the first few vertical cuts makes it hard to determine the location of the break radius .",
    "although we do not know yet whether thick disks are indeed truncated , we have shown that the vertical structure harbours clues to understand the origin of the different radial profiles and should be pursued .",
    "for example , luminous , not - truncated thick disk components could be responsible for the high frequency of not - truncated lenticular galaxies in face - on surveys , while having a broken exponential structure close to the midplane of the galaxy . in conclusion ,",
    "observations of the vertical structure set strong constraints on modelling / simulating disk galaxies and the interpretation of their various components . in the future ,",
    "a larger , well selected sample of edge - on galaxies will be analysed in order to shed light on some of the issues raised here .",
