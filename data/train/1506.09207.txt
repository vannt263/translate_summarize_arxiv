    "with the discovery of his famous gedanken experiment , james clerk maxwell started physics on the long road to the unification of thermodynamics with information theory @xcite .",
    "nearly 200 years later , with the ever - advancing miniaturization of devices @xcite , the idea that one could exploit detailed knowledge of a system s microstate as a thermodynamic resource no longer seems like a mere idealization @xcite . to the contrary , we hope to someday soon push our technology to the regime where quantum effects become relevant @xcite .",
    "since there are more delicate constraints on correlations in the quantum world , like strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy , as well as a variety of monogamy relations ( exclusive trade - offs ) among different kinds of correlations , it is timely to consider a question unforeseen in maxwell s time : _ how can correlations be harnessed for the performance of these devices in the fully general quantum setting ? _",
    "this significant question has been studied extensively from different perspectives , and it has been mentioned that correlations can yield an advantage in performing certain thermodynamic tasks , such as work extraction @xcite . in this paper , we focus on two key challenges : ( i ) accounting for the contribution of correlations to the second law of thermodynamics and ( ii ) comparing quantum and classical correlations as thermodynamic resources on the same footing",
    ". regarding ( i ) , it is important to notice that the system is coupled to external degrees of freedom in quantum open - system dynamics , and the resulting correlations can be utilized , in principle , by an external , _ classical _ agent to  measure \" the system and gain knowledge in the framework of feedback control @xcite . however",
    ", this utilization of correlations should be distinguished from the way an internal agent like a quantum maxwell demon , or a part of the quantum system , handles correlations , since the latter is the scenario we are interested in here .",
    "regarding ( ii ) , the majority of prior works @xcite defines quantum and classical maxwell demons in such a manner that the classical version is treated as a limiting case ( typically with a fixed basis ) .",
    "this obviously makes the classical demon at most as powerful as the quantum one , but it may not immediately imply that classical correlations are at most as useful as quantum correlations for the demon who can handle both kinds .    to address point ( i ) , we study a quantum system which exhibits an information - work trade - off independently of any external agent . following a pioneering work of the classical autonomous maxwell demon studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider a scenario in which a qubit , in contact with two heat reservoirs of different temperatures , accesses sequentially many memory qubits , and we analyze their correlations in the fully quantum regime .",
    "we think this to be among the simplest models to exhibit the thermodynamic features akin to a quantum maxwell demon . for point ( ii ) ,",
    "as defined formally in the next section , we stress that our demon is _ identical _ regardless of the nature of information in its memory .",
    "this allows us to unambiguously define work performed by the demon , since there has otherwise been difficulty in doing so due to the intrinsic  uncertainty \" of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "here we discover a new nonequilibrium phase of our demon : refrigeration against a thermal gradient coincident with memory erasure at the expense of correlations .",
    "we find that correlations enable our demon to exploit quantum coherence to realize an advantage over its classical counterpart . to handle the complexity of correlations",
    ", we apply a tool from condensed - matter physics  the matrix product density operator formalism  which makes tractable our calculations in the fully quantum - correlated regime .",
    "this technique exploits the fact that correlations built under local interactions change locally @xcite .",
    "it thus gives a powerful tool for treating correlations in the thermodynamic framework , a task which has otherwise remained formidable .",

    "our autonomous maxwell demon [ fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) ] is a generalization of the model proposed in ref .",
    "the  demon \" @xmath0 is a qubit spanned by orthonormal basis states @xmath1 and @xmath2 with energy gap @xmath3 .",
    "it interacts sequentially with qubits in an infinitely long one - dimensional array @xmath4 , called the memory .",
    "the qubits in @xmath4 are energetically degenerate and may be initially correlated , though they are noninteracting among themselves .",
    "the memory thus acts only as an informational , and not an energy , resource . when discussing a given interaction",
    ", we will refer to the interacting memory qubit simply as @xmath5 , the system of memory qubits which have previously interacted as @xmath6 , and that of those which are yet to interact as @xmath7 . for each such qubit",
    ", we define a  classical basis \" @xmath8 . in what follows",
    ", we choose the qubit pauli-@xmath9 operator of @xmath0 , @xmath10 , to be diagonal in its energy eigenbasis and that of @xmath5 , @xmath11 to be diagonal in its classical basis .",
    "we are free to choose a phase convention , which we keep fixed , in defining the pauli-@xmath12 and -@xmath13 operators , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , of these systems",
    ". we will also need    @xmath16    on these systems as well .",
    "finally , we will use    @xmath17    as a shorthand for the population bias of @xmath5 in its @xmath9 basis .",
    "+    the device operates cyclically ; @xmath0 interacts with @xmath5 for an interaction time @xmath18 before @xmath4 moves by one site to the right , and the sequence repeats .",
    "each interaction consists of two simultaneous processes , each in contact with a different thermal reservoir . in the first",
    ", the demon undergoes _ intrinsic transitions _ , wherein it exchanges a unit @xmath19 of energy with a  hot \" reservoir at temperature @xmath20 . in the second , the joint system @xmath21 undergoes _ cooperative transitions _ , wherein the demon exchanges @xmath19 of energy with a  cold \" reservoir at temperature @xmath22 , and the interacting qubit is flipped .",
    "intrinsic transitions occur with rates @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and cooperative transitions with rates @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these rates are chosen to satisfy detailed balance    @xmath27    where the @xmath28 are the inverse temperatures , and we have chosen units such that the boltzmann factor is 1 .",
    "we thus describe each transition by a lindblad jump operator    @xmath29    finally , we define    @xmath30 \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as a parameter quantifying the magnitude of the thermal gradient .",
    "formally , our interaction sequence is generated by the time - dependent lindbladian    @xmath31 \\rm { , } \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the time - independent interaction lindbladian between @xmath0 and the @xmath33th qubit in @xmath4 , described by the aforementioned lindblad jump operators ( see appendix  [ sec : lindbladian ] for details ) .",
    "@xmath34 is the heaviside step function , and so these factors  switch on \" the interaction @xmath32 for @xmath35 . in the limit of many interactions ,",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    is the state of the full system at time @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is a sufficiently large positive integer . in what follows",
    ", we will only be interested in the performance of the device over a single interaction in periodic steady state .",
    "we therefore omit the explicit time dependence where appropriate and denote quantities corresponding to the outgoing qubit in the interaction as primed and those to the incoming as unprimed \\{e.g . ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42$]}. similarly , we will refer to the corresponding interaction lindbladian simply as @xmath43 , dropping the qubit label for convenience .",
    "there are two special cases of this model which are of interest to us .",
    "the first is the _ classical _ case , in which the evolution during each interaction is constrained to population dynamics in the eigenbasis of @xmath44 .",
    "the interaction @xmath43 is  classical \" in the sense that if the initial state of @xmath21 is diagonal in this basis , then the evolution will remain so throughout .",
    "that is to say that the evolution does not mix together populations and coherences in this basis .",
    "additionally , it drives the state of @xmath21 to a unique fixed point @xmath45 , which is a product of classical states of @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "the second special case is the _ uncorrelated _ case , in which the state of @xmath4 is initially a product , and we neglect any correlations that are built over repeated interactions with the demon . though the full dynamics , generated by @xmath46 , is a sequence of local quantum operations , it may either build or consume correlations in the full state , since there is a common degree of freedom , @xmath0 , between all of them . in general , one or both of these special cases may hold .",
    "figure  [ fig : model](b ) shows two cyclic processes over which energy is pumped against the thermal gradient ( dashed arrows ) . the horizontal bit - flip transitions ( dot - dashed arrows ) , which complete each cycle , are provided by the translation of the memory . if the sum of the probabilities of these processes is greater than that for the reverse processes , then there is a net flow of energy against the gradient , and we say the system is _",
    "refrigerating_. note that both processes flip the qubit from the @xmath47 state to the @xmath48 state , so a record of the refrigeration is left on the memory .",
    "we thus define    @xmath49    as the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir during the interaction , which is negative when the system is refrigerating .",
    "note that this property of the model removes any ambiguity in our definition of work .",
    "we also define    @xmath50    where    @xmath51    is the von neumann entropy .",
    "the change @xmath52 represents the entropy dumped onto the memory .",
    "when @xmath53 , the memory is being _",
    "erased_.    in the uncorrelated classical regime , our model reduces to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was first introduced .",
    "there , it was shown that    @xmath54     + in this regime .",
    "we refer to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : localclausius ] ) as the _ local clausius inequality_. it represents a strict trade - off between the refrigeration ( @xmath55 ) and erasure ( @xmath53 ) phases of the device .",
    "this trade - off can be understood geometrically . in the absence of correlations or quantum coherence ,",
    "the interacting qubit is driven monotonically along the @xmath9 axis of the bloch sphere to its fixed point , @xmath56 , which has positive bias @xmath57 .",
    "erasure and refrigeration correspond to approaching this fixed point from @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "so long as this evolution is monotonic , the trade - off is necessarily strict .",
    "it is noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that when correlations can not be neglected , this result generalizes to    @xmath60    where    @xmath61    is the change in the quantum mutual information    @xmath62    @xmath63 can be either positive or negative in general , so the trade - off in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : localclausius ] ) becomes no longer strict .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a third thermodynamically nontrivial phase , in which the device is refrigerating and erasing simultaneously .",
    "we expect this to occur when correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath5 induce nonmonotonic evolution on @xmath5 alone . however , eq .  ( [ eqn : genlocalclausius ] ) is inconvenient in that it does not involve only terms that can be calculated from the evolution on the memory alone and so requires knowledge of the periodic steady state , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : genpss ] ) .",
    "one of our contributions is to provide a constraint free of this limitation , which is also strict in the presence of correlations and makes their utility as a thermodynamic resource manifest .",
    "our first result is to recover the second law in terms of the relevant thermodynamic variables in the fully quantum correlated case .",
    "this is the _ global clausius inequality _ , which we state as a theorem .",
    "[ thm : globalclausius ] the global clausius inequality , @xmath64 which represents an information - work trade - off of the thermodynamic quantities defined above , holds for a periodic steady state in the fully quantum correlated regime . accordingly , simultaneous refrigeration and erasure is possible only if it is attended by the consumption of correlations .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : globalclausius ] ) represents a strict three - way trade - off among refrigeration , erasure , and the generation of correlations @xmath65 , all of which may be calculated from knowledge of the initial and final states of the memory alone",
    ". the minus sign on @xmath65 places consumption of correlations as a resource ; the more negative this term , the more negative the local terms can be .    to provide a sketch of the proof of theorem  [ thm : globalclausius ] ( full details can be found in appendix [ sec : gcproof ] ) ,",
    "we first note    @xmath66    which follows in the same manner as eq .",
    "( [ eqn : genlocalclausius ] ) from monotonic evolution to the fixed point @xmath67 , but including the system @xmath7 as an ancilla .",
    "next , we have    @xmath68    the first inequality follows from strong subaddivity : mutual information is nonincreasing under partial trace .",
    "the last step follows from the periodic steady - state condition , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : genpss ] ) .",
    "that is , the mutual information between @xmath0 and the qubits yet to interact@xmath69 before the interaction and @xmath7 after the interaction  is a constant across interactions in steady state .",
    "thus    @xmath70    and using    @xmath71    where @xmath72 due to the fact that @xmath7 does not participate in the interaction , therefore gives the result .",
    "we see that simultaneous refrigeration and local erasure is not forbidden by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : globalclausius ] ) so long as correlations are consumed , but it remains to be seen that our model actually exhibits such behavior . we address this in the following sections .",
    "the matrix product state formalism has been very successful as an efficient representation of the quantum correlations present in a one - dimensional spin - chain @xcite . because dynamics in contact with a thermal bath are dissipative",
    ", we need a generalization of this formalism to mixed states and classical correlations .",
    "this is the _ matrix product density operator _",
    "( mpdo ) formalism , introduced in refs .  @xcite and further developed in refs .  @xcite . the mpdo description of a mixed state of @xmath73 @xmath74-dimensional spins with periodic boundary conditions is given by    @xmath75    where the @xmath76 , and the @xmath77 are @xmath78 matrices corresponding to the spin at site @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath79 is the path - ordering operator , which places operators of higher @xmath33 to the left in the product .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the description eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mpdodef ] ) can be obtained from a corresponding pure matrix product state by tracing out ancillary degrees of freedom on each of the spins .",
    "it thus reduces to those for pure matrix product states and classically correlated distributions as special cases . because we are interested in the periodic steady - state behavior of our model , we restrict ourselves to the single - site _ translationally invariant _ case where the @xmath77 are independent of the site label @xmath33 .",
    "we thus have that the @xmath80 are all equal .",
    "this quantity is known as the _ bond dimension _ of the mpdo , which quantifies the degree to which the state is correlated .",
    "note that , in this representation , the state is specified by @xmath81 complex parameters , an exponential improvement  when bond dimension is polynomial in @xmath73  over the @xmath82 complex parameters required to specify each of the matrix elements of @xmath83 individually .    in our model , we let @xmath84 be the parametrization of the initial quantum correlated state of the memory @xmath4 , which is uncorrelated with the initial state of @xmath0 .",
    "we first solve the lindblad master equation for an individual interaction    @xmath85    analytically in mathematica , obtaining an expression for the quantum operation    @xmath86     +    we then update our initial state @xmath87 to @xmath88 according to the sequential evolution , eq .",

    "[ fig : quantumadv](b ) for @xmath143 , we show the difference in erasures between the quantum and classical inputs as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "the quantum coherent state @xmath159 has an advantage when this quantity is negative .",
    "this plot bears some resemblance to fig .",
    "[ fig : newphase](b ) .",
    "this is no coincidence . in the same way as classical correlations in @xmath21 can allow the bloch vector of @xmath5 to momentarily move away from its fixed point along the @xmath9 axis , they can also allow it to do so in the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane , though the effect is smaller by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this deviation from monotonicity appears as an erasure advantage since our interaction @xmath92 treats the classical and coherent components of the evolution separately .",
    "the refrigerative performances of the two inputs are thus identical as we expect .",
    "what is remarkable is that even though both @xmath159 and @xmath161 share the same classical histories in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cqseparablemain ] ) , the small amount of coherence on the reduced state @xmath165 seems to be able to seed the production of more coherence .",
    "this is especially surprising given the fact that our dynamics @xmath92 also has many classical features .",
    "the explanation is that the coherences on the conditional states of @xmath5 for each classical history _",
    "interfere _ such that there is more coherence on @xmath166 after the evolution than before .",
    "we have shown that our model of an autonomous maxwell demon can utilize correlations in its memory to gain a thermodynamic advantage over its uncorrelated counterpart .",
    "that is , as predicted by the global clausius inequality , it performs simultaneous refrigeration and erasure , which is impossible without correlations , and exploits quantum coherence to enhance the performance of memory erasure .",
    "this work represents a proof - of - principle , and we hope that it paves the way to invent a quantum thermodynamic device which is more well suited to utilizing correlations .    there are two concluding discussions .",
    "first , in this work , entanglement did not demonstrate a genuine advantage over classical correlations .",
    "this is because of the long - range nature of ghz correlations .",
    "namely , tracing out a distant subsystem gives a classically correlated state but does not affect the thermodynamic performance , which is determined by the local interaction between the demon qubit and one of memory qubits .",
    "however , as far as we have explored , some translationally invariant , short - range - correlated states ( such as the one - dimensional cluster state @xcite ) did not exhibit the simultaneous refrigeration - erasure phase .",
    "more demanding numerical calculation seems to be needed to generalize beyond these simple initial states , to address the question about strict supremacy of entanglement .",
    "second , the simplicity of our model could bring the testing of quantum coherence as a thermodynamic resource closer to experimental feasibility , since the model shares similarities with quantum heat engines @xcite .",
    "though we consider a concrete experimental proposal to be beyond the current scope of the paper , we note that there are similarities between our model and the quantum heat engines considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", a two - level system ( tls ) , such as a pair of electronic energy levels of an optically active rubidium atom , is periodically driven by a red - detuned laser field and independently coupled to two thermal baths , such as the photon bath of a cavity and the  dephasing bath \" of a buffer gas , at different temperatures .",
    "we envision the tls serving the role of the demon in these systems , while the laser realizes the memory .",
    "as a buffer gas molecule approaches the rubidium atom , it perturbs the energy gap of the tls into resonance with the laser , allowing the atom to become excited . once the buffer molecule has scattered , and the gap of the tls has widened back to its unperturbed value , the rubidium atom may fluoresce , radiating a quantum of energy into the photon bath .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite note the existence of a regime where the dephasing bath may be cooled at the expense of work provided by the laser , with energy transfer to the photon bath mediated by the tls .",
    "this regime has been observed experimentally as reported in refs .  @xcite .",
    "though we do not expect our model s hamiltionian to be isomorphic to that of this system , we do expect that it can be treated using our formalism in the case where the laser field state is correlated .",
    "the most severe imperfections to this setup would come from limitations on the experimenter s ability to produce a precisely correlated state .",
    "we refrain from speculation on what experimental techniques are needed to prepare such states .",
    "here we found that the novel thermodynamic behavior was rather sensitive to the strength of the correlations [ in the phase diagram , fig .",

    "this latter feature , should it survive in other architectures , could be promising for prospective experiments .",
    "finally , our investigation was by no means exhaustive , so it remains to be seen what types of correlation are needed to optimize the thermodynamic performance of these particular experimental setups",
