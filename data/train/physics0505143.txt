    "the past decade has brought fascinating advances in the preparation and control of single particles @xcite .",
    "atoms can now be cooled down to a level where the effect of a single photon recoil can be measured experimentally @xcite .",
    "single atom dynamics can thus be controlled with high precision by introducing an external field in the form of an optical potential @xcite .",
    "a particular example of such a system , the atom ",
    "optics kicked rotor , has shed light on interesting and paradigmatic quantum effects including dynamical localisation @xcite and quantum resonance @xcite . in all such experiments , control of the initial conditions in phase space",
    "is essential . in particular , the impact of different momentum classes on the dynamics near quantum resonance was explained recently @xcite .",
    "the atoms are kicked by a spatially periodic potential which is pulsed on at a certain frequency .",
    "as dictated by standard bloch theory , the spatial periodicity implies that the quasi ",
    "momentum for the centre - of - mass motion of each atom is conserved during the evolution .",
    "momentum is an intrinsically quantum variable which arises due to the translational symmetry of the problem @xcite . since experiments with cold atoms typically use a broad , continuous distribution of quasi ",
    "momenta , the experimental data represents a result averaged over this initial distribution @xcite .",
    "the averaging over different momentum classes leads to significant deviations from the standard @xmath0kicked rotor model @xcite which typically does not consider the additional control parameter introduced by the quasi  momentum .",
    "such deviations have been experimentally observed , in particular at quantum resonance @xcite and have been explained theoretically by means of a new pseudo  classical model introduced in @xcite and applied to the usual @xmath0kicked rotor in @xcite .    in this paper , we use the same theoretical formalism to expose the innate similarities and surprising differences between the limit in which the exact quantum resonant driving is approached and the limit of vanishing kicking period .",
    "the former limit can be described using the pseudo  classical model from @xcite ( with an effective planck constant defined by the detuning from exact resonance ) , whilst the latter limit is the usual classical limit of the kicked rotor ( with the scaled kicking period as the effective planck constant ) .",
    "our theoretical analysis of the experimental data focuses on the role of the quasi ",
    "momentum , which proves to be quite different in the two `` classical '' limits studied here .",
    "we consider a system of caesium atoms in an optical standing wave ( with wave number @xmath1 ) which is @xmath0pulsed with period @xmath2 . for sufficiently large detuning from the atomic absorption line ,",
    "the hamiltonian for an atom is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the atomic momentum in units of @xmath5 ( i.e. , in units of two - photon recoils ) , @xmath6 is the atomic position in units of @xmath7 , @xmath8 is time and @xmath9 is the kick number .",
    "the scaled kicking period @xmath2 is defined by the equation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the recoil energy ( associated with the energy change of a caesium atom of mass @xmath12 after emission of a photon of wavelength @xmath13 nm ) .",
    "the kicking strength of the system is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the maximum potential depth created by the optical standing wave @xcite .",
    "experimentally , momentum kicks are delivered to the atoms by an optical lattice which is created by a 150mw diode laser injection locked to a lower power feedback stabilised source at 852 nm . kicking laser powers of up to @xmath16",
    "were employed for detunings of @xmath17 from the @xmath18 transition of caesium . for the experimental results presented in this paper ,",
    "the average energy of the atomic ensemble was measured after up to 20 kicks . to control the pulse timing ,",
    "a custom built programmable pulse generator was employed to gate an acousto ",
    "optic modulator which controlled the amount of kicking light reaching the atomic sample .",
    "timing of the experiment was controlled by a real - time , software based computer system with a latency on the order of 10@xmath19s .    for the classical resonance experiments reported here , the kicking pulse width was 320ns ,",
    "whilst for the quantum resonance results , a 480ns pulse width was used . in the classical limit of vanishing kicking period ,",
    "the @xmath0kick approximation is violated in the experiment ( although for the small kick numbers and kicking strengths used here , our results do not show deviations from the @xmath0kick theory @xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "it is possible to probe the dynamics at exact _",
    "quantum _ resonance , but not at the exact classical limit , since the pulse period @xmath2 should always exceed the pulse width to ensure a reliable approximation to @xmath0pulses .",
    "the experimental sequence ran as follows : atoms were released from the magneto  optical trap  @xcite and then kicked by a series of light pulses .",
    "a free expansion time of 12 ms was then allowed followed by `` freezing '' of the atomic motion in optical molasses and subsequent ccd imaging of the resultant atomic cloud  @xcite .",
    "mean energies are extracted from the raw data by calculating the second moment of the experimentally measured momentum distribution of the atoms centre - of - mass motion .    by exploiting the spatial periodicity of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) ,",
    "the atomic dynamics along the @xmath6 axis can be reduced to that of a rotor on a circle by bloch s theorem @xcite .",
    "this introduces the additional parameter @xmath20 which represents the atomic quasi  momentum  a constant of the motion by bloch s theorem .",
    "the fractional part of the physical momentum @xmath4 in the units given above corresponds to the quasi  momentum which is practically uniformly distributed in the fundamental brillouin zone defined by the periodic kick potential @xcite .",

    "the quantum dynamics in the two semiclassical limits studied here is approximated by the following map @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the sign of @xmath39 , and for @xmath40 only @xmath41 is allowed ) .",
    "the above map is similar to the well - studied standard map @xcite augmented by the term @xmath42 which accounts for the experimental quasi  momentum distribution .",
    "changing variables to @xmath43 , @xmath44 formally gives the true standard map @xmath45 the mean energy is calculated using the formula @xmath46 although the map ( [ eq : epsmap ] ) is not explicitly dependent on the additional @xmath47 dependent term , we note that the initial conditions in momentum space are given by @xmath48 , i.e. , they are defined by the initial choice of quasi  momentum @xmath47 .",

    "the ratio saturates to a constant for large @xmath51 after initial oscillations , as the classical and quantum resonance peaks decay at the same rate .",

    "two a priori quite different regimes are described by either of the two maps ( [ eq : clmap ] ) or ( [ eq : epsmap ] ) : firstly that for @xmath52 , and @xmath53 and secondly that for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , for integer @xmath56 . in the case where @xmath52 we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 , with the physical momentum @xmath4 in units of two  photon recoils @xcite . for integer @xmath59 ,",

[ fig:1 ] ( a ) ) , a uniform quasi  momentum distribution on @xmath68 leads to the initial momenta @xmath29 being uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the characteristic width of the initial atomic momentum distribution in units of two - photon recoils .",
    "therefore , for @xmath71 , the initial momenta lie entirely within the region of phase space dominated by the nonlinear resonance island of the standard map . for @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) ) , and the _ same _ uniform quasi  momentum distribution , the initial momenta populate the full unit cell @xmath73 in the periodic phase space which encompasses not only the nonlinear resonance island at @xmath74 , but also regular `` rotation '' motion beyond it .",

    "these results may be summarised by the following single parameter scaling functions which differ for the two limits of interest here . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the scaling function of the mean energy close to @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 with @xmath78 and the function @xmath49 defined by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the momentum of the pendulum approximation to the dynamics generated by the map of eq .",

    "the difference in the saturation values of the two @xmath86 functions arises from the different initial conditions in the the phase space of map [ eq : clmap ] which apply in the classical and @xmath39classical limits .    in the following section , we compare experimental data for the two different cases @xmath52 and @xmath87 guided by the theoretical results reviewed in the present section .",

    "@xcite . for small times ( @xmath100 for the data in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) ) , the energy growth near the classical resonance is _ ballistic _ , i.e. , the energy grows quadratically in time .",
    "we note that ballistic motion is also predicted to occur at quantum resonance for an atomic ensemble with a very narrow initial momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "but the broad initial momentum distribution present in cold atom experiments as discussed here , typically leads to a uniform distribution of all possible values of quasi ",

    ", these experimental initial conditions correspond to initial momenta distributed over the full phase space cell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the majority of the atoms obey rotational motion with almost constant energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) ) , whilst only a small sub - class follows the motion inside the nonlinear resonance island , which for a finite time ( depending on the detuning @xmath39 ) supports ballistic energy growth @xcite .",
    "the connection between the dynamics in the classical limit and that for a quantum particle starting from a momentum eigenstate is found in the term @xmath42 in the map ( [ eq : clmap ] ) .",
    "we see that this term may become zero in either of the following limits : @xmath53 or @xmath101 . in both cases ,",
    "the effect is to regain ballistic energy growth .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) shows a detailed scan of the mean energy near the classical resonance as @xmath53 which emphasises the rapid energy growth seen in this regime associated with the ballistic classical resonance .    figure [ fig:3 ] ( b ) shows mean energy measurements at exact quantum resonance ( circles ) and for @xmath94 along with @xmath39classical simulation results ( dashed lines ) . for _ the same experimental momentum distribution _ , only linear mean energy growth is predicted to occur at exact quantum resonance . additionally , the data shown here demonstrate a practical problem which arises from the uniform distribution of quasi ",
    "momenta over the first brillouin zone .",
    "because only the quasi  momentum classes @xmath102 ( for @xmath103 ) and @xmath104 ( for @xmath105 ) experience quantum resonant dynamics @xcite , only a small number of resonant atoms are responsible for the linear growth of the ensemble mean energy . the measurement of the mean energy at exact quantum resonance is therefore experimentally very challenging since the signal - to - noise ratio is low for the small population of resonant atoms @xcite .",
    "this is the most likely cause of the apparent saturation of energy growth in the quantum resonance case as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( b ) where the experimental mean energy ( circles ) noticeably deviates from the expected linear growth ( dashed line ) .",
    "indeed , inspection of the experimental momentum distributions for the on  resonance data reveals that the characteristic ballistic wings associated with resonant atoms @xcite are not resolved for kick numbers greater than about @xmath106 in these experiments .    by comparison with the data in [ fig:3 ] ( a ) for the classical resonance",
    ", we see that , even though the maximum energy is much larger than that measured at quantum resonance for the same number of kicks , the initial quadratic mean energy growth can easily be resolved since practically the _ entire atomic ensemble _ experiences resonant energy growth in this regime .",
    "this is precisely because as @xmath2 tends to zero , the @xmath47 dependence of the map ( [ eq : clmap ] ) is removed as the term @xmath42 vanishes at the same rate as @xmath2 .     and",
    "@xmath107 ( squares ) . in particular , the circles for @xmath108",

    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) .",

    "the scaling functions for the classical ( [ eq : scalcl ] ) and quantum resonances ( [ eq : scal ] ) are shown as a solid line and a dashed line respectively .",
    "the narrower width of the classical resonance peak is immediately apparent .",
    "this figure also shows the utility of the scaling function in the comparison of data which is meaningful in the scaled units even for a wide range of the three parameters : here for @xmath96 and @xmath111 ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath111 ( @xmath87 ) , @xmath112 ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath113 ( @xmath87 ) , and @xmath114 .",

    "[ fig:4 ] shows rescaled data from experimental measurements for various experimental parameters with @xmath52 ( circles ) and @xmath87 ( squares ) .",

    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) .",
    "this data provides a detailed confirmation of the classical scaling function s validity for smaller values of @xmath51 than previously observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , it is found that the @xmath0kicked rotor theory holds even in a regime of @xmath51 for which the spacing between kicking pulses is comparable to the width of the pulses themselves @xcite .",
    "the smallest value of the kicking period @xmath2 for which the @xmath0kicked model remained valid in these experiments was @xmath116 which , for a kicking strength @xmath111 and @xmath97 , corresponds to @xmath117 . for larger @xmath51 ,",
    "the data points show more scatter because of systematic fluctuations in the initial momentum spread and the difficulty in observing the peak very close to resonance for a larger number of kicks @xcite .",

    "momentum distribution in two different semiclassical limits of the atom ",
    "optics kicked rotor . for",
    "the _ same _ experimental quasi  momentum distribution , the true classical limit gives rise to _ ballistic _ energy growth whereas in the pseudo - classical limit approximating quantum resonance only linear growth occurs .",
    "this difference is explained by considering the inclusion of the quasi  momentum dependent term @xmath118 in the theoretical description .",
    "if this term approaches zero , which may be accomplished either by performing the classical limit @xmath88 or starting with a very narrow momentum distribution such as that provided by a bose - einstein condensate @xcite , ballistic energy growth is recovered .",
    "however , for standard atom",
    " optics kicked rotor experiments using cold atoms only linear energy growth is predicted at quantum resonance since the quasi ",
    "momentum @xmath47 is uniformly distributed in the entire brillouin zone .",
    "the classical theory of section [ drei ] of the near resonant dynamics thus unifies the description of quantum and classical resonance behaviour of the atom  optics kicked rotor , and",
    "is elegantly summarised by two classical one - parameter scaling laws for the classical and quantum resonance peaks .",
    "these laws are very useful for a detailed analysis of experimental results in regimes in which measurements are limited by the signal - to - noise ratio .",
