    "<S> we present a comprehensive theory of the circularly polarized luminescence and its dependence on strain in spin - polarized si and ge . </S>",
    "<S> symmetries of wavefunctions and interactions are used to derive concise ratios between intensities of the right and left circularly polarized luminescence for each of the dominant phonon - assisted optical transitions . </S>",
    "<S> these ratios are then used to explain the circular polarization degrees of the luminescence peaks in the spectra of biaxially - strained si and ge , and of relaxed @xmath0 alloys . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are numerically calculated by a combination of an empirical pseudopotential method , an adiabatic bond - charge model and a rigid - ion model . </S>"
