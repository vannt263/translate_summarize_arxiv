    "in normal metal / supercunductor ( n / s ) junctions andreev reflection ( ar)@xcite is one of the most important process for low energy transport . the ar is a process that an electron with up spin injected from n at the energy below the energy gap @xmath0 is converted into a reflected hole with up spin . to describe the charge transport in n / s junctions blonder ,",
    "tinkham and klapwijk ( btk ) proposed the formula for the calculation of the tunneling conductance@xcite .",
    "a gap like structure and the douling of tunneling conductance appear in the voltage dependence due to the ar .",
    "this method has been extended to the ferromagnet / superconductor ( f / s ) junctions and used to estimate the spin polarization of the f layer experimentally@xcite . in f",
    "/ s junctions , ar is suppressed because the retro - reflectivity is broken by the exchange field in the f layer@xcite . as a result",
    ", the conductance of the junctions is suppressed@xcite .",
    "spin dependent transport in f / s junctions is an important subject in the field of spintronics which aims to fabricate novel devices manipulating electron s spin .",
    "spintronics has recently received much attention because of its potential impact on electric devices and quantum computing@xcite . among recent works ,",
    "many efforts have been devoted to study the effect of spin - orbit coupling on transport properties of two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg)@xcite . the pioneering work by datta and das suggested the way to control the precession of the spins of electrons by the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc)@xcite in f/2deg / f junctions@xcite .",
    "this spin - orbit coupling depends on the applied electric field and can be tuned by a gate voltage . on the other hand spin dependent transport based only on spin - orbit coupling without ferromagnet , e.g. , spin hall effect is also a hot topic@xcite .    as in the case of exchange field in f",
    "/ s junctions , rsoc may affect the tunneling conductance in 2deg / s junctions because rsoc mixes spin - up and spin - down states .",
    "the rsoc induces an energy splitting which lifts the spin degeneracy , but the energy splitting does nt break the time reversal symmetry unlike an exchange splitting in ferromagnet ( see fig .",
    "therefore transport properties in 2deg / s junctions may be qualitatively different from those in f / s junctions .",
    "however , in 2deg / s junctions the effect of rsoc on transport phenomena is not studied well .",
    "it is desirable to make a formalism incorporating the effect of the rsoc in these junctions . for this purpose a btk - like",
    "formula may be accessible .",
    "however the derivation of the conductance by btk can not be directly extended to that in 2deg / s junctions because velocity operator has off - diagonal components by rsoc . in this paper",
    "we present a general method to derive a conductance in superconducting junctions which is applicable to arbitrary velocity operator with off - diagonal components . applying it",
    ", we calculate the tunneling conductance in 2deg / s junctions , compare it with that in f / s junctions and clarify how rsoc affects the ar and normal reflection probabilities .",
    "the obtained results can be useful for the design of mesoscopic 2deg / s junctions and for a better understanding of related experiments .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will provide the detailed derivation of the expression for the conductance . in section iii ,",
    "the results of calculations are presented for various types of junctions . in section iv , the summary of the obtained results is given .",
    "in the present paper we confine ourselves to zero temperature .",
    "we consider a ballistic 2deg / s junctions where the 2deg / s interface is located at @xmath1 ( along the @xmath2-axis ) , and has an infinitely narrow insulating barrier described by the delta function @xmath3 .",

    "this is because the ar probability is reduced by the exchange field .",
    "therefore the effect of the rashba splitting on conductance is essentially different from that of zeeman splitting on conductance .",

    "the zeeman splitting gives unbalance of populations of up and down spin electrons .",
    "thus it suppresses the ar where pairs of spin - up and spin - down electrons are transmitted to s. on the other hand , the rashba splitting never causes such an unbalance .",
    "thus it can not suppresses the ar , which results in various @xmath52 dependence of the conductance .    in order to explain the line shapes of the conductances",
    ", we will check the angular averaged normal reflection and ar probabilities as a function of voltage . for large @xmath60 , ar probabilities are small and normal reflection probabilities reflect the dependence of the densities of states on @xmath52 : @xmath37 is a decreasing function of @xmath52 , while @xmath38 is an increasing function of @xmath52 .",
    "therefore @xmath64 and @xmath65 are reduced and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are enhanced with the increase of @xmath52 .",

    "ar probabilities ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) are slightly enhanced around @xmath72 and have similar structures with the increase of @xmath52 while normal reflection probabilities @xmath66 and @xmath67 increase with the increase of @xmath52 . on the other hand normal",
    "reflection probabilities @xmath64 and @xmath65 are reduced with the increase of @xmath52 . in other words , reflected waves with wave number @xmath73 are suppressed ( enhanced ) by rsoc .",
    "the enhancement and the suppression compete with each other .",
    "thus the conductance is almost independent of rsoc . for small @xmath60 ,",
    "normal reflection probabilities are small .",
    "ar probabilities @xmath68 and @xmath71 are reduced as increasing @xmath52 .",
    "this stems from the mismatch of fermi surfaces between 2deg and s by the increase of @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath58 ( see fig . [ f7 ] ) normal reflection probabilities @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and ar probabilities @xmath70 and @xmath71 are slightly enhanced with the increase of @xmath52 .",
    "normal reflection probabilities @xmath64 and @xmath67 increase by the increase of @xmath52 .",
    "on the other hand ar probabilities @xmath68 and @xmath71 within the energy gap are reduced with the increase of @xmath52 .",
    "this means that only eigenfunctions with the same wave number as the injection wave are affected by rsoc . from fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , we can understand the suppression of the tunneling conductance by rsoc ( see eq . ( 7 ) ) .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the tunneling conductance in two dimensional electron gas / insulator / superconductor junctions with rsoc .",
