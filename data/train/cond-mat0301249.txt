    "during the last few years , it has been shown that quantum entanglement of states @xcite is considered to be a basic prerequisite for teleporation of quantum state , quantum communication , quantum computing , quantum information processing and experimentally testing quantum mechanics .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies on quantum communication through the use of quantum entangled states have shown great promise for establishing new kinds of information processing with no classical counterparts .",
    "one example is the concept of quantum teleporation@xcite , where an entangled source was built from two single - mode phase squeezed vacuum states combined at a beamsplitter .",
    "other examples of the application of entanglement states to quantum communication include dense coding@xcite and cryptography@xcite .",
    "it is believed that the use of entangled states can lead to a substantial decrease of computational resources@xcite .",
    "also , entangled states have been widely used to test fundamental quantum features such as nonlocality@xcite .",
    "these extensive studies have paved a way toward a variety of useful quantum informational devices .",
    "two - mode quantized electromagnetic fields can be entangled and admit a large number of coherent states@xcite .",
    "most of these coherent states may be associated with low - order lie algebra su(1,1 ) @xcite .",
    "for example , two interesting types of su(1,1 ) coherent states are the perelomov coherent states ( pcs ) @xcite and barut - girardello coherent states@xcite .",
    "the former involves strong correlations between the modes and is generated from the unitary evolution of two - mode number states driven by a nondegenerated parametric device@xcite ( for example , the type that gives rise to down - conversion or harmonic generation ) .",
    "the latter type also involves tight correlations with respect to the photon number states between the modes and may be generated in a process involving the competition between nondegenerate parametric amplification and nondegenerate two - photon absorption@xcite .",
    "the other class of two - mode su(1,1 ) coherent states is the intelligent states @xcite , which equalize various possible uncertainty product that can be constructed as consequence of the su(1,1 ) commutation relation . also , the two - mode squeezed pair - coherent state@xcite is an intelligent state but with unequal uncertainty .",
    "all of these two - mode su(1,1 ) coherent states may be written as superposition of the form @xmath0 @xcite , where the modes are labeled by 1 and 2 , respectively , and the integer number @xmath1 is the ( fixed ) difference in the photon numbers of the two - modes and the coefficient @xmath2 depends on the specific su(1,1 ) coherent state .",
    "these states are of interest because they often display nonclassical characteristics such as squeezed light and photon antibunching as well as violations of the cauchy - schwarz inequality and bell s inequality @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study further the properties of these correlated states of the field since the importance lies in their close connection to the two - photon nonlinear optical processes . on the other hand , because the study of the squeezed states can provide a fundamental understanding of quantum fluctuations and open the way for new schemes of quamtum communication or imaging beating the standard quantum noise limit , we pay attention to investigating the generation of atomic dipole squeezing ( ads)@xcite in a two - mode system that consists of a two - level atom interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field , which is initially prepared in an entangled two - mode coherent state , via a nondegenerate two - photon process in a lossless cavity .",
    "we find that entangled two - mode coherent states of the field can also display ads and that the stronger the correlations between the modes are involved , the more the ads could be generated .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the theoretical model of the two - mode system and give its general solutions . in section iii",
    ", we briefly introduce the definition of atomic dipole squeezing . in section",
    "iv , assuming that the two - level atom is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of its ground and excited states and that the quantized electromagnetic field is initially in a two - mode pcs , we investigate the generation of ads in the two - mode system and examine in detail the effects of detuning , stark shift and atomic coherence on ads .",
    "finally , our conclusion and discussions are presented in section v.",
    "we consider a two - level atom interacting with two modes of a quantized electromagnetic field via a nondegenerate two - photon process in a lossless cavity . for convenience ,",
    "we denote @xmath3 as the natural transition frequency between the excited state @xmath4 and the ground state @xmath5 of the two - level atom and @xmath6 as the frequency of mode @xmath7 of the field .",
    "it is known that some intermediate virtual states @xmath8 , which are assumed to be coupled to the excited and ground states of the two - level atom by a dipole - allowed transition , are involved in the two - photon process .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 is about several times @xmath10 and the two modes are tuned as near one - photon resonance as possible but still off the one - photon linewidth , i.e. , the detuning @xmath11 and @xmath12 are larger than but as close as the linewidth of @xmath8 . for the case of @xmath13 and",
    "by the method of adiabatic elimination of the virtual state @xmath8 @xcite , gou@xcite obtained an effective hamiltonian for this system within a rotating - wave approximation @xmath14 where @xmath15 . here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are operators of the atomic pseudospin inversion and transition , respectively , and satisfy the commutation @xmath18 = 2 s_{z},\\ ] ] @xmath19 = \\pm s_{\\pm}.\\ ] ] @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the creation and annihilation operators for the photons of mode @xmath22 , respectively , which obey the boson operators commutation relation @xmath23=\\delta_{ij}.\\ ] ] @xmath24 is the coupling constant between the atom and the field .",
    "a stark shift is caused by the intermediate virtual state @xmath8 , and the corresponding parameter @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the coupling strengths of the intermediate virtual state with the ground and excited states of the two - level atom , respectively . throughout we employ the units of @xmath33 .",
    "we denote @xmath34 as the fock state of the field . using the standard bare - state procedure introduced by yoo and eberly@xcite",
    ", we are able to calculate the expectation value of any operator in the two - mode system described above . in an ideal cavity ,",
    "the two - level atom absorbs and emits one pair of photons , and the two bases in the bare - state representation are given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "thus , the total hamiltonian given by eq.(1 ) can be written as : @xmath37.\\ ] ] the eigenvalues of the above hamiltonian are @xmath38+\\epsilon\\gamma(n_{1},n_{2 } ) , \\\\",
    "\\sigma_{-}&=&\\omega_{1}n_{1}+\\omega_{2}n_{2}+\\frac{1}{2}[\\omega+ \\beta_{2}n_{2}+\\beta_{1}(n_{1}+1)]-\\epsilon\\gamma(n_{1},n_{2})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39/\\sqrt{\\mu } & \\   & \\mu\\ne 0 , \\\\ \\delta & \\   & \\mu = 0 , \\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the scaled detuning and the two - photon rabi frequency is written as @xmath42 it should be mentioned that @xmath43 is the case in the absence of stark shift .",
    "then , the time evolution operator @xmath44 of the two - mode system is given by @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46\\exp(-i\\sigma_{+}t)+ \\left[1-\\frac{\\chi(\\mu , n_{1},n_{2})}{2\\gamma(n_{1},n_{2 } ) } \\right]\\exp(-i\\sigma_{-}t),\\nonumber\\\\ e_{-}(t)&=&\\left[1-\\frac{\\chi(\\mu , n_{1},n_{2})}{2\\gamma(n_{1},n_{2 } ) } \\right]\\exp(-i\\sigma_{+}t)+\\left[1 + \\frac{\\chi(\\mu , n_{1},n_{2})}{2\\gamma(n_{1},n_{2 } ) } \\right]\\exp(-i\\sigma_{-}t ) , \\nonumber\\\\ \\zeta(t)&=&\\sqrt{(n_{1}+1)(n_{2}+1 ) } \\left[\\exp(-i\\sigma_{+}t)-\\exp(-i\\sigma_{-}t)\\right]/\\gamma(n_{1},n_{2}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the resonant case ( i.e , @xmath47 ) , our solutions are in agreement with those obtained by gou@xcite .",
    "once the matrix representation of @xmath48 is obtained , the density operator of the two - mode system at time @xmath49 can be calculated with an arbitrary initial condition @xmath50 by @xmath51 thus , the expectation value of any physical operator @xmath52 and its dependence on time can be obtained through the formula @xmath53.\\ ] ]",
    "squeezed states@xcite are distinguished by the property that the quantum fluctuations in a dynamical observable may be reduced below the standard quantum noise limit at the expense of increased fluctuations in its canonical conjugated variable without violating the heisenberg uncertain relation . since the first observation of squeezed states of light , the generation of squeezed states has been the subject of an intense theoretical and experimental activity @xcite .",
    "the study of these states provides a fundamental understanding of quantum fluctuations and opens a way for new schemes @xcite of quantum communication or imaging beating the standard quantum noise limit .",
    "it has been predicted that a number of physical systems @xcite ( e.g. , four - wave mixing , two - photon laser , parametric amplifiers and raman scattering ) can generate squeezed states of the radiation field .",
    "also , it is known that atomic dipole squeezing ( ads)@xcite could be generated through many kinds of nonlinear optical processes@xcite , such as resonance fluorescence , cooperative dicke system , rydberg atom maser , and so on .",
    "for the special case of a vacuum - field mode , wodkiewicz et al.@xcite examined the relationship between ads and field squeezing .",
    "very recently , a general relationship between field squeezing and ads has been established under different initial conditions for both the field and atom in a high - q micromaser cavity @xcite , and it has been shown that squeezed atom can generate squeezed light . in this paper , assuming that the field is initially prepared in an entangled two - mode coherent states , we study the generation of ads in the two - mode system introduced above .    here",
    "we briefly introduce the definition of atomic dipole squeezing @xcite . following the standard procedure ,",
    "we define two slowly varying hermitian quadrature operators@xcite @xmath54,\\\\ s_{y}&=&\\frac{1}{2i}\\left[s_{+}\\exp(-i\\omega t)-s_{- } \\exp(i\\omega t)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 , actually , correspond to the dispersive and absorptive components of the slowly varying atomic dipole@xcite , respectively .",
    "they obey a commutation relation given by @xmath57 = i s_{z}$ ] .",
    "correspondingly , the heisenberg uncertainty relation is@xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the variance in the quadrature component @xmath60 ( j = x , y ) of the atomic dipole . for convenience , we define the following functions@xcite @xmath61 then , the atomic state is said to be squeezed if @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) .",
    "this is the general definition of ads@xcite .",
    "from the two - photon rabi frequency @xmath64 given by eq.(10 ) , we find that one of its terms , @xmath65 given by eq.(9 ) , would not vanish for general two - mode field states due to the arbitrariness of photon number @xmath66 and @xmath67 which are presented in the term @xmath65 .",
    "hence , in this sense , we can not ignore the effect of the stark shift in the two - mode system .",
    "of course , it is possible to eliminate or weaken this effect .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath68 , then we have @xmath69 it is obvious that if there exists some kinds of correlation between the two - mode fields , for example , the difference between their photon numbers is fixed at a constant , i.e. , @xmath70 ( @xmath1 , an invariant integer ) , then the term @xmath71 would be fixed at @xmath72 which is intensity independent . moreover , if we choose the case of @xmath73 ( assuming that the scaled detuning @xmath74 takes an integer value ) , we see that the term @xmath71 would vanish .",
    "this is only true for physical quantities which are not sensitive to the phase@xcite . for phase - sensitive quantities",
    ", the stark shift still plays an important role in determining their dynamical behaviours .",
    "we shall clarify this point in our following results .    in the two - mode system , we assume that the two - level atom is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of its ground state @xmath75 and excited state @xmath76@xcite @xmath77 and that the two - mode field is initially in a two - mode pcs given by@xcite @xmath78^{1/2}\\xi^{n }   \\mid n+q\\rangle_{1}\\mid n\\rangle_{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath79 with @xmath80 and the phase @xmath81 , and the number @xmath1 ( a positive integer or zero ) is the eigenvalue of @xmath82 . using eqs.(14 )",

    "obviously , if we choose @xmath68 and @xmath73 , then the term @xmath71 in the atomic inversion @xmath16 given by eq.(23 ) vanishs .",
    "thus the effect of stark shift on @xmath16 can be totally eliminated . however , for phase - sensitive quantities , for example , the two components @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the atomic dipole given by eq.(24 ) and ( 25 ) , respectively , we see that the stark - shift - induced phase @xmath89 could not vanish with the time evolution of the two - mode system , i.e. , the effect of stark shift on @xmath55 or @xmath56 can not be eliminated . as an example ,",
    "fig.1(a - c ) show the time evolution of @xmath16 and @xmath56 for the case of @xmath90 when the two - level atom is initially prepared in its excited state . comparing fig.1(b ) with fig.1(a ) , one can see the distinguished effect of the stark shift on the dynamical behaviours of @xmath16 and @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , comparing fig.1(c ) with fig.1(a ) , one can find that for the case of @xmath91 and @xmath68 the effect of stark shift on @xmath16 is totally eliminated , but that on @xmath56 still exists .",
    "hence , we may conclude that the presence of stark shift could bring phase information into the quadrature components @xmath55 and @xmath56 , but not to the atomic inversion @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we would expect that there is a significant effect of stark shift on the squeezing properties of quantum fluctuations in one of the quadrature components of the atomic dipole .    in the following , taking the quantum fluctuations in the quadrature component @xmath55 of the atomic dipole as an example , we investigate the generation of ads in the two - mode system . throughout , we set the phase of the parameter @xmath92 at zero , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "first , we examine the resonant case and consider that the stark shift is absent .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig.2 - 4 .",
    "assuming that the atom is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of its ground and excited states , as shown in fig.2(a - c ) , we see that regular and periodical ads patterns are observed for the cases of @xmath94 and @xmath95 . as the value of the parameter @xmath96",
    "is increased to 0.5 , we find that the regular and periodical ads pattern is destroyed greatly .",
    "moreover , comparing fig.2(b)(c ) with fig.2(a ) , we find that as the number @xmath1 varies from 1 to 8 , the squeezing duration is decreased gradually and the squeezing period is also shortened . in fig.2(d ) , we display the relation between the function @xmath97 and the number @xmath1 at a fixed interaction time @xmath98 for the case of @xmath94 .",
    "it is found that the squeeze depth ( strength ) is decreased as the number @xmath1 varies from 1 to 200 and ads can be shown only for @xmath99 .",
    "this implies that the stronger the correlations between the modes are involved , the more the atomic dipole squeezing could be generated .",
    "next , we examine the effect of atomic coherence on ads exhibited in the two - mode system . holding the phase @xmath88 at zero and the interaction time @xmath100 at @xmath101",
    ", we show in fig.3 the relation between @xmath97 and the coefficient @xmath102 for @xmath103 as the number @xmath1 varies from 1 to 8 . for @xmath90",
    ", it is seen that ads can be generated in a wide squeezing range of the parameter @xmath102 ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) .",
    "however , increasing the number @xmath1 would narrow down the squeezing range , and ads depth is decreased greatly .    then",
    ", we turn to examine the phase dependence of ads generated in the two - mode system . for @xmath103 , @xmath98 and @xmath105",
    ", fig.4 presents the relation between @xmath97 and the relative phase @xmath88 as the number @xmath1 varies from 1 to 8 .",
    "we find that in the case of @xmath90 ads can be exhibited in a wide squeezing range of @xmath88 around @xmath106 .",
    "however , the squeezing range is narrowed down as the number @xmath1 increases .",
    "finally , we consider the nonresonant case and examine in detail the effects of detuning and/or stark shift on ads .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig.5(a - d ) for q=1 , @xmath94 and different choices of parameter pair @xmath74 and @xmath107 . comparing fig.5(b)(d ) with fig .",
    "5(a ) , we find that the detuning or stark shift has a destructive effect on the ads pattern exhibited in fig.5(a ) . the squeezing duration is decreased and the ads pattern is irregular and nonperiodic . for the case of @xmath91 and @xmath68 , as discussed above , the effects of stark shift on @xmath16 can be eliminated totally but those on @xmath55 and @xmath56 can not .",
    "hence , we would expect a significant effect of the stark shift on ads . as shown in fig.5(c ) , we really observe a regular , periodic and strong ads pattern which is generated due to the combined effect of detuning and stark shift .",
    "compared to fig.5(a ) , the squeezing duration in fig.5(c ) is decreased due to the combined effect of detuning and stark shift .",
    "in this paper , we have considered a two - mode system that consists of a two - level atom interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field , which is initially prepared in an entangled two - mode pcs , via a nondegenerate two - photon process in a lossless cavity .",
    "we have investigated the generation of ads in this system and examine in detail the effects of detuning , stark shift and atomic coherence on ads .",
    "we show that ads strongly depends on the atomic coherence .",
    "it is found that the stronger the correlations between the modes are involved , the more the ads can be generated .",
    "the detuning or stark shift has a destructive effect on ads .",
    "however , the combined effect of the detuning and stark shift may lead to periodical , regular and strong ads pattern but with decreased squeeze duration .",
    "gou@xcite have shown that the correlation is responsible for generating the squeezing of the cavity fields .",
    "our prediction of ads in the two - mode system agrees well with this argument .",
    "in addition , it is obvious that two - mode squeezed vacuum@xcite ( i.e. , the special case of the two - mode pcs for @xmath108 ) is a strongly correlated quantum state since in the number - state expansion there are always an equal number of photons in the @xmath109 and @xmath110 modes .",
    "hence , a strong ads pattern in the two - mode system would be expected if the field is initially prepared in a two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "this point can be clearly seen from fig.6 , where we compare the ads pattern of @xmath108 with that of @xmath90 .",
    "actually , in this paper , our discussion is restricted to an ideal case , i.e. , without considering the cavity damping in the two - mode system . in the realistic situation ,",
    "a high but finite cavity q indeed causes some inevitable effects of photon dissipation in the cavity .",
    "hence , it would be significant and interesting to include the cavity damping in the two - mode system and examine the effect of cavity damping on ads predicted in this paper .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that there are several significant experimental schemes which involve the nonresonant interaction of the atom with two nondegenerate cavity modes , for example , those illustrated in the works of gou@xcite and abdalla _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and the recent one realized by haroche s group@xcite with a single circular rydberg atom in a cavity .",
    "certainly , these schemes could be helpful for realizing the two - mode system introduced in section ii and for further understanding the ads predicted in this paper .",
