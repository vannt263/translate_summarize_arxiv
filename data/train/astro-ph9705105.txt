    "the 8.9  s pulsations from 2e0050.17247 together with the probable identification of an h@xmath6 emitting counterpart strongly suggest that the x  ray source is an accreting magnetic neutron star likely in a be star x  ray binary .",
    "the x  ray source was detected over a range of 0.13.5  kev luminosities from @xmath68 to @xmath1 1.4 @xmath69  ergs  s@xmath4 ; on other occasions the source remained undetected , with upper limits that in two cases were just below the minimum detected luminosity .",
    "these large variations are suggestive of a transient behaviour .    the relatively low peak x ",
    "ray luminosity detected from 2e0050.17247 indicates that the source was observed either during the decay ( or the rise ) of a large outburst or during a lower luminosity ( possibly recurrent ) outburst .",
    "increased h@xmath6 emission from av111 or the other candidate ( star1 ) could provide a useful indicator of resumed x  ray activity from 2e0050.17247 ( this might be also useful to confirm the association of either candidates to the x  ray source ) . based on the orbital period / spin period correlation found by corbet ( 1984 ) for be star x  ray pulsars , the orbit of 2e0050.17247 should be in the @xmath70  d period range .    despite the limited energy range ,",
    "the power law spectral slope of 2e0050.17247 measured by rosat when the source luminosity was @xmath71  ergs  s@xmath4 ( @xmath72 ) is similar to that of most accreting x  ray pulsars .",
    "a substantially softer spectrum ( @xmath73 ) was measured when the source luminosity was @xmath74  ergs  s@xmath4 .",
    "a clear spectral evolution was observed in the outburst decay of a sample of transient x  ray pulsars , such as v0332 + 53 ( makishima _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) and exo2030 + 375 ( reynolds , parmar & white 1993 ) .",
    "however in these cases the lowest detected luminosities were substantially higher ( @xmath75  ergs  s@xmath4 ) than in the case of 2e0050.17247 ; this suggests that their neutron stars were further away from the regime of centrifugal inhibition of accretion which occurs close to the end of a transient x  ray pulsar outburst ( stella , white & rosner 1986 ) . by requiring that the centrifugal barrier is open for an accretion luminosity of @xmath71  ergs  s@xmath4",
    "we derive an upper limit of @xmath76  g to the magnetic field of the neutron star in 2e0050.17247 . for a spin period of 8.9",
    "s the luminosity gap across the centrifugal barrier should be a factor of @xmath77 ( corbet 1996 ) , indicating that when the source was a factor of @xmath7 fainter the centrifugal barrier could not be completely closed and accretion onto the neutron star still took place .",
    "the case of 2e0050.17247 , together with that of the other x  ray pulsars discussed above , suggests that the production of very soft x  ray spectra results ( for some yet unknown reason ) from the accreting neutron star approaching the regime of centrifugal inhibition of accretion .",
