    "@xcite ) .",
    "this paper studies such adhesion problems mathematically in a one - dimensional setting . to be more precise , we consider the minimizing problem of the energy @xmath0=\\int_{\\gamma}ds\\left[\\frac{c}{2}\\kappa^2(s ) + \\sigma\\left(\\gamma(s)\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] defined for planar curves @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the curvature and arc length parameter respectively .",

    "the constant @xmath5 corresponds to the bending rigidity .",

    "( see section [ sectprelimi ] for details . )",
    "our energy is a simple generalization of the modified total squared curvature , so - called euler s elastica energy ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) , so that a contact potential corresponding to an adhesion effect is included .",
    "its minimization invokes a free boundary problem with the elastica equation .",
    "the free boundary conditions are concerned with jumps of curvatures ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "our model can be regarded as an elastic version of wetting problems ( cf .",
    "the energy ( [ energy0 ] ) is introduced in @xcite expressly ; the paper derives free boundary conditions and moreover investigates ground and metastable states for sinusoidal and fakir carpet substrates under the small slope approximation . in @xcite ,",
    "the author derived a singular limit energy as @xmath10 for general smooth substrates in the graph setting . in @xcite ,",
    "a discretized energy is studied for graphs of uniformly bounded slope .",
    "all the previous results assume the graph representation of admissible curves @xmath1 , i.e. , the absence of overhangs .",
    "this yields strong topological and morphological constraints which make the problem easier to analyze , however its adequacy is nontrivial .",
    "in fact , the aforementioned paper @xcite shows a numerical example with blowing - up slope , which indicates the existence of a non - graph minimizer ( this example is pointed out by the author to exist ) .",
    "the present paper gives the first rigorous study on the adequacy ; providing that substrates are graphs but admissible curves are not necessarily so , we consider whether global minimizers ( ground states ) are represented as graphs .",
    "global minimizers should be flat in many limiting cases ; dominant bending effect ( @xmath11 ) , no adhesion ( @xmath12 ) or flat substrate ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "hence , the graph representation is expected at least nearly the above cases .",
    "indeed , theorem [ thmnooverhang ] and [ thmnooverhang2 ] give some quantitative conditions that minimizers must be graphs .",
    "the conditions correspond to the above three cases .",
    "our proof relies on only energy arguments ; we compare all non - graph curves with special graph competitors .",
    "on the other hand , even if @xmath4 is smooth of class @xmath14 , it turns out that there are situations such that global minimizers are overhanging , i.e. , not represented by graphs .",
    "more precisely , as a main result ( theorem [ thmoverhanging ] ) , we rigorously prove that minimizers must overhang for any small @xmath15 and @xmath8 and almost singular substrates @xmath4 with @xmath16 , which are smooth but shaped like fakir carpets .",
    "our proof is based on a geometric viewpoint to classify possible global states of non - overhanging curves by using the shape of @xmath4 , and an energy estimate for each of the cases . a special overhanging competitor",
    "is then constructed in view of optimal bending scale .",
    "furthermore , we also prove that if such substrates are lipschitz , i.e. , folding singularly @xmath17 , then @xmath15 can be small arbitrarily for a fixed substrate ( theorem [ thmoverhanging2 ] ) . to this end",
    ", we need further discussion for local bending structure , however we still only use energy arguments .    in the rest of this section , reviewing related mathematical literature , we see that in our one - dimensional problem both the contact potential and the total squared curvature play crucial roles for overhangs .",
    "there is much mathematical literature of first order energies with contact potentials on flat substrates ( see e.g.  @xcite for graphs , @xcite for the boundary of sets and references therein ) .",
    "the problems in the cited papers roughly correspond to our problem with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( but in higher dimensions ) . in first order cases , solutions may have edge singularities at the free boundary and the contact angle @xmath20 satisfies young s equation @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , solutions may not be graphs in some higher dimensional cases ( cf .",
    "however , although our substrates are not flat , our problem is one - dimensional and periodic thus the graph setting would be still suitable providing @xmath18 .    to our knowledge",
    ", there is little mathematical literature of higher order problems with contact potentials except the aforementioned papers @xcite .",
    "the total squared curvature is higher order and causes the loss of graph representation .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that there are non - graph solutions to the elastica equation , which our minimizers obey in the free part ( see e.g.  the figures in @xcite ) . thus , imposing suitable boundary conditions ( or length constraints ) , it is not difficult to see that a global minimizer of the modified total squared curvature would overhang .",
    "our problem is a free boundary problem , hence the graph representation problem is more involved .",
    "we finally mention that , in dynamical problems of curves ( without constraints ) , the graph representation of solutions has also been concerned . although the @xmath22-gradient flow of the length energy ( curve shortening flow ) preserves the graph property @xcite , one of the modified total squared curvature ( curve shortening - straightening flow @xcite ) may lose in the middle even in the periodic setting @xcite",
    ". however , in such a periodic case without external factors , the stationary global minimizers are only straight lines .",

    "the proof is now complete .",
    "in this section , we give some further remarks and discussions .",
    "we first discuss the graph representation of minimizers for small bending scale @xmath67 .",
    "recall that theorem [ thmnooverhang ] states that large bending scale @xmath96 implies the graph representation independently of @xmath4 .",
    "the case @xmath250 is not easy to obtain the graph representation since bending does not cost much energy . indeed ,",
    "theorem [ thmoverhanging ] and [ thmoverhanging2 ] state that overhanging minimizers exist when @xmath67 is small and the minimal bending scale @xmath213 of @xmath4 is much smaller .",
    "however , we may expect the graph representation when @xmath67 is sufficiently smaller than @xmath213 by the following formal observation ( cf .",
    "when @xmath4 is smooth and @xmath251 , minimizers shall be lipschitz functions with straight free parts as in figure [ figvalleyfold ] .",
    "they have edge singularities at the contact points as valley folds and the minimal distance @xmath252 among the singularities is bounded below ( by a constant depending on @xmath68 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , for small @xmath253 , any minimizer would be obtained by modifying such valley folds smoothly as in figure [ figvalleyfold ] .",
    "moreover , in contrast to mountain folds ( figure [ figmountainfold ] ) , the modification of valley folds would not require to increase the slope .",
    "hence any minimizer is expected to be a graph curve .",
    "theorem [ thmnooverhang2 ] states that a second order flatness of @xmath4 implies the graph representation of minimizers ; for any @xmath56 and @xmath62 there is @xmath254 such that if @xmath4 satisfies @xmath255 then any minimizer is a graph curve .",
    "the problem would become more difficult if we replace @xmath256 with @xmath257 or @xmath4 .",
    "another interesting problem is the following uniform and strong version : is there @xmath254 such that for any @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath4 with @xmath255 or @xmath258 any minimizer is a graph curve ?",
    "notice that theorem [ thmoverhanging2 ] states that any smallness of @xmath259 does not imply the above conclusion .",
    "self - intersections are more difficult to occur than overhangs in the sense that any self - intersecting curve in @xmath46 must be overhanging . here",
    "we say that @xmath51 has a self - intersection if there are @xmath260 and @xmath261 such that @xmath262 .",
    "this definition is suitable for our periodic setting ; if we take @xmath263 such that @xmath264 for any @xmath50 , then @xmath118 is not injective if and only if the restriction @xmath265 has a self - intersection in the above sense .",
    "this paper proves the existence of overhanging minimizers , but it is not clear whether there exist self - intersecting minimizers in our setting .    our admissible curves @xmath51 may have any self - intersection ( self - contact and self - crossing ) as mentioned , thus our problem would be a priori suitable only for filaments but not membranes . to make our problem compatible with membranes ,",
    "we especially need to exclude self - crossing curves . to this end , let @xmath266 be the @xmath39-weak closure of the set of curves without self - intersection .",
    "this set is compatible with membranes since @xmath267 consists of non self - intersecting curves and limits of such curves at least in @xmath40 ; especially , any curve of @xmath267 is not self - crossing but only self - contacting",
    ". then all the results in this paper are valid even if we replace @xmath46 with @xmath267 in the problem ( [ minimizingproblem ] ) since all the competitors used in our proof have no self - intersection .",
    "the existence of minimizers is proved in the same way as appendix [ appendix1 ] since @xmath267 is @xmath39-weakly closed .",
    "we mention that this kind of self - contact setting has been considered in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the paper @xcite proves for confined closed free elasticae that ( i ) any convex confinement admits only convex minimizers , which especially have no self - intersection , and ( ii ) there is a confinement with two halls which admits a self - contacting minimizer .",
    "these results indicate that whether minimizers have self - contacts crucially relates to the simplicity of confinements .",
    "our graph confinements are simple , however the effect of adhesion make curves easier to form complicated shapes and hence the self - intersection problem becomes more nontrivial .",
    "we finally mention local minimizers .",
    "a curve @xmath268 is called a local minimizer if there is @xmath166 such that @xmath66\\geq e[\\gamma_0]$ ] for any @xmath51 with @xmath269 .",
    "a straight line sufficiently above @xmath4 is obviously a graph local minimizer in any case .",
    "however , the straight line touching @xmath4 is not necessarily a local minimizer .",
    "the existence of graph local minimizers touching @xmath4 is not trivial .",
    "moreover , it is shown that there are infinitely many self - intersecting local minimizers in @xmath46 by using a kind of winding number . for @xmath51 , the winding number @xmath270 is defined so that @xmath271 is equal to the total curvature , or equivalently @xmath272 where @xmath273 is a continuous representation of tangential angle ( unique up to addition by a constant of @xmath274 ) .",
    "the winding number is obviously continuous with respect to the @xmath40-topology , thus so with respect to the weak and strong @xmath39-topologies .",
    "thus , denoting by @xmath275 the set of all curves with @xmath276 , for any @xmath277 the set @xmath278 is open and closed in @xmath46 with respect to both the weak and strong @xmath39-topologies .",
    "since @xmath278 is weakly closed , in the same way as appendix [ appendix1 ] , we can prove that for any @xmath277 there is a minimizer of @xmath69 among @xmath278 . then , since @xmath278 is strongly open , it turns out that such a minimizing curve is nothing but a local minimizer in the whole space @xmath46 . any curve with @xmath279",
    "has a self - intersection , thus there are infinitely many self - intersecting ( and overhanging ) local minimizers in @xmath46 . in the membrane setting @xmath267 , the above argument does not work since the winding number of any curve is zero , thus the existence of overhanging local minimizers is nontrivial .",
    "we considered the one - dimensional energy minimizing problem ( [ minimizingproblem ] ) concerning periodic filaments and membranes adhering to graph substrates with the same period .",
    "we obtained sufficient conditions so that any global minimizer is represented as a graph ( theorem [ thmnooverhang ] and [ thmnooverhang2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , by considering fakir carpet like substrates , we proved that there are situations so that any minimizer is overhanging , i.e. , not represented as a graph ( theorem [ thmoverhanging ] and [ thmoverhanging2 ] ) .",
    "all the results are valid both the problems of filaments and membranes .",
    "this paper dealt with substrates only of special shape for overhangs , however it would make the mechanism of overhangs more understandable .",
    "one direction of future works is to understand the mechanism for more general substrates .",
    "we then need to consider more precisely both local and global structure of substrates ; in particular , we should perceive general `` depth of halls '' or `` sharpness of mountains '' .",
    "in addition , we exhibited related open problems in the previous section .",
    "in particular , it would be important to understand the possibility of self - intersections and the shape of local minimizers .",
    "concerning self - intersections , we may need to take interactions of filaments or membranes themselves into account for more physical situations .",
    "the author would like to thank professor olivier pierre - louis for his comments and discussion .",
    "this work was supported by a grant - in - aid for jsps fellows 15j05166 and the program for leading graduate schools , mext , japan .",
    "we confirm the existence theorem ( theorem [ thmexistence ] ) by a direct method in the calculus of variations .",
