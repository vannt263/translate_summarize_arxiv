    "recent experimental progress in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite enables not only to determine the position of features in the electron spectral function , but also to study more subtle issues such as the spectral lineshapes .",
    "at least for the conventional low - temperature superconductors , there does exist a theoretical technique which can address such issues - namely the eliashberg theory,@xcite which allows for strong coupling between the electrons and bosonic collective modes .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether this type of theory is applicable to the cuprates .",
    "moreover , even conventional superconductors may possess complicated phonon spectra and/or they can exhibit substantial elastic scattering,@xcite both of which complicate the eliashberg analysis .",
    "for all these reasons , it is desirable to have a simple and generic theory which does take finite quasiparticle lifetimes in superconductors into account",
    ".    let us start by noting that spectral functions of a bcs superconductor in presence of elastic pair - conserving scattering can be found even in textbooks.@xcite however , it is well known that the density of states ( or the so - called tomographic density of states in case of anisotropic superconductors@xcite ) implied by such spectral functions exhibits a full spectral gap consistent with the anderson theorem . on the other hand ,",
    "experimentally , the gap is quite often only partial@xcite and the tunneling density of states is better described by the phenomenological dynes formula.@xcite this means then that , in order to take the non - trivial density of states into account , also a second type of scattering processes - which are not subject to the anderson theorem - have to be considered .",
    "two - lifetime phenomenology of precisely this type has in fact been applied quite recently,@xcite with the aim to parameterize the high - resolution arpes data in the nodal region of the cuprates .",
    "the goals of this paper are twofold .",
    "first , in section  2 we demonstrate that the model used in ref .   can be cast into a form consistent with the generalized eliashberg theory , and that it exhibits several attractive features .",
    "we also show that the resulting @xmath0 nambu - gorkov propagator violates the sum rule for the occupation number and therefore the model used in ref .",
    "should be discarded .",
    "our second goal is to demonstrate that , nevertheless , a fully consistent two - lifetime phenomenology for superconductors does exist . to this end",
    "we consider the recently proposed model of the so - called dynes superconductors,@xcite wherein the two - lifetime phenomenology results as a consequence of taking into account both , the pair - conserving and the pair - breaking scattering processes . in section  3",
    "we present detailed predictions for the spectral functions of the dynes superconductors and we explicitly demonstrate the applicability of this approach to the low - temperature arpes data in the nodal region of the cuprates . furthermore , in the appendices",
    "we show that the model of the dynes superconductors is fully consistent with known exact results , and we present explicit formulas for the momentum distribution functions@xcite within the eliashberg theory .",
    "finally , in section  4 we present our conclusions .",
    "following previous theoretical suggestions,@xcite the authors of ref .",
    "fit their high resolution arpes data in the nodal region of optimally doped and overdoped bi2212 samples to spectral functions derived from the phenomenological self energy @xmath1 and they interpret the scattering rates @xmath2 and @xmath3 as the single - particle and pair scattering rates , respectively .",
    "we shall comment on these identifications later .    in order to demonstrate the physical meaning of the phenomenological self energy eq .",
    ", let us first note that it implies that the electron green function in the superconducting state can be written in the form @xmath4 where we have introduced @xmath5 and @xmath6 . according to ref .",
    ", throughout the superconducting phase @xmath7 .",
    "with increasing temperature @xmath8 decreases and it vanishes at the critical temperature .",
    "the main observation of this section is that eq .",
    "should form the upper left component of the general @xmath0 nambu - gorkov green function for a superconductor : @xmath9\\tau_3 +    \\phi(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)\\tau_1}{\\left[\\omega z(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)\\right]^2 -    \\left[\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k } } + \\chi(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)\\right]^2 -    \\phi(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 are the pauli matrices , @xmath11 is the wave - function renormalization , and @xmath12 is the anomalous self - energy .",
    "the function @xmath13 describes the renormalization of the single - particle spectrum and it vanishes in a particle - hole symmetric theory ; that is why it is usually neglected . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "let us mention that the matrix @xmath14 does not enter eq .",
    ", because we work in a gauge with a real order parameter .    since in the high - frequency limit the functions",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 should stay at most constant , eq .   in this limit",
    "can be uniquely interpreted in terms of the general expression eq .   with @xmath18 where we have chosen a real anomalous self - energy @xmath16 .",
    "one checks readily that eq .",
    "reproduces eq .   for all frequencies .",
    "the finite value of @xmath15 is unusual but seems to be attractive , since the cuprates , being doped mott insulators , might be expected to break the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "note also that all three functions @xmath19 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 do not depend on @xmath20 , which is the standard behavior .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0 formalism leads to a redundant description , and therefore the green function has to satisfy additional constraints .",
    "these constraints are most clearly visible in the matsubara formalism , therefore let us reformulate eq .   on the imaginary axis ,",
    "allowing explicitly only for frequency - dependent functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 : @xmath24 due to the redundancy of the @xmath0 formalism , singlet superconductors have to exhibit the following symmetry : @xmath25 note that the functions eq .",
    "read as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 on the imaginary axis .",
    "it is easy to see that when these expressions are plugged in into eq .",
    ", the green function does satisfy eq .  .    an additional attractive feature of the phenomenology eq .",
    "is that it leads ( also for finite values of @xmath29 ) to the dynes formula for the tunneling density of states , @xmath30 , \\label{eq : dynes}\\ ] ] in agreement with the experimental findings of ref .  .",

    "the broken particle - hole symmetry is clearly visible already in the normal state with @xmath35 , in which case @xmath36 these results show that @xmath3 and @xmath2 should not be interpreted as pair and single - particle scattering rates as has been done in ref .  , but rather as the scattering rates for the holes and for the electrons , respectively .     of an electron inside the fermi sea according to the model  .",
    "the widths of the electron - like branch at @xmath37 and of the hole - like branch at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the quasiparticle energy eq .  , are essentially determined by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively.,width=264 ]    unfortunately , eqs .",

    "the integrals on the left - hand side can be taken easily and the results are @xmath47 it can be seen readily that , if @xmath48 , the sum rule   is violated by these results .",
    "one might have the impression that the particle - hole asymmetry which causes the sum rule violation is an artifact of our generalization of the green function   to the matrix form  .",
    "that this is not the case can be seen by plotting the spectral function directly for eq .",
    ", see fig .  [",
    "fig : kondo ] , which clearly shows that the electron- and hole - like branches exhibit different scattering rates .",
    "we conclude that the phenomenology   is internally consistent only if @xmath49 , in which case @xmath50 .",
    "but then the green function   has a simple two - pole structure with poles at @xmath51 where @xmath52 implying that the spectral function is a sum of two lorentzians .",
    "however , the authors of ref .   stress that the experimentally observed lineshapes are asymmetric .",
    "this means then that the phenomenology   is not applicable to the nodal spectral functions of the cuprates .",
    "very recently , a consistent two - lifetime phenomenology for superconductors has been derived within the coherent potential approximation , assuming a lorentzian distribution of pair - breaking fields and an arbitrary distribution of pair - conserving disorder.@xcite if we denote the pair - breaking and pair - conserving scattering rates as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , then the result of ref .   for the nambu - gorkov green function of the disordered superconductor",
    "can be written as @xmath55 + \\varepsilon_{\\bf k}\\tau_3 } { ( \\omega+i\\gamma_s)^2-\\varepsilon_{\\bf k}^2 } , \\label{eq : dynes_green}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 some useful properties of the function @xmath57 are described in appendix  a. the tunneling density of states implied by the green function eq .",
    "is described by the dynes formula eq .   with @xmath58 , and that is why superconductors described by eq .",
    "have been called dynes superconductors in ref .  .",
    "in this work we shall keep this term .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in absence of pair - breaking processes , eq .   reproduces the textbook results for pair - conserving scattering ,",
    "see e.g. refs .  .",
    "on the other hand , in the opposite limit @xmath59 when only pair - breaking processes are present , eq .   coincides with the phenomenology   in the physically consistent case with @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , in the normal state with @xmath35 the green function eq .   becomes diagonal and its matrix elements are @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the total scattering rate , which involves both , pair - breaking as well as pair - conserving scattering processes .",
    "note that eq .",
    "does not exhibit the pathologies implied by eq .  .",
    "one checks readily that the green function eq .",
    "is analytic in the upper half - plane of complex frequencies , as required by causality , and that @xmath63 for @xmath64 . in appendix",
    "b , we present an explicit proof that eq .",
    "satisfies the well - known sum rules for the zero - order moments of the electron spectral function , in particular also the sum rule eq .  .",
    "moreover , in appendix  d we prove that the electron and hole spectral functions are positive - definite , as required by general considerations .    in view of these observations",
    ", we believe that eq .   represents the simplest internally consistent green function for a superconductor with simultaneously present pair - breaking and pair - conserving scattering processes .",
    "this generic bcs - like green function is parameterized by three energy scales : scattering rates @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as well as by the gap parameter @xmath65 . in what follows",
    "we present a detailed analysis of its spectral properties .",
    "spectral functions of the dynes superconductor for an electron with momentum @xmath20 fixed to lie inside the fermi sea are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arpes1 ] .",
    "the bcs quasiparticle peaks at @xmath66 are seen to be broadened by the total scattering rate @xmath67 , irrespective of the ratio between pair - breaking and pair - conserving scattering processes .",
    "the relative importance of the two types of processes becomes important only in the vicinity of the chemical potential . for @xmath68",
    "a full spectral gap appears for @xmath69 , in agreement with the anderson theorem , and additional peaks appear in the spectral function at @xmath70 . after switching on a finite pair breaking rate @xmath71 ,",
    "the spectral gap starts to fill in , and at the same time the peaks at @xmath70 get smeared away . finally ,",
    "when @xmath72 and the pair - conserving processes disappear completely , the spectral function is given by a sum of two lorentzians centered at @xmath73 .",
    "spectral functions for an electron directly at the fermi surface , @xmath74 , are somewhat different and they are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : arpes2 ] .",
    "the difference is caused by the fact that the quasiparticle energies @xmath75 in this case coincide with @xmath76 . therefore only two peaks are present in the spectral function , in contrast to the general case with four peaks .",
    "however , the rest of the phenomenology can be simply related to the case @xmath77 : the high - energy form of the spectral functions is controlled exclusively by the total scattering rate @xmath67 , whereas finite pair - breaking fills in the spectral gap and smears the peaks at @xmath70 .    in appendix",
    "c we complement the discussion of electron spectral functions by studying the so - called momentum distribution functions.@xcite in addition to presenting explicit formulas valid for any eliashberg - type superconductor with only frequency - dependent functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we also show that making use of the momentum distribution functions , one can determine the total scattering rate @xmath67 of a dynes superconductor in an alternative way .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] we demonstrate that eq .   can fit the experimentally observed symmetrized spectral functions in the nodal region of the cuprates with at least comparable quality as  eq .  .",
    "the number of fitting parameters is the same for both fits : two scattering rates , the gap @xmath65 , and the energy scale @xmath80 which determines the phenomenological background @xmath81 .",
    "this type of background description has been used in all fits presented in ref .  .",
    "we have determined the fitting parameters by the standard least - squares technique in the interval from -100  mev to 100  mev ; their values are @xmath82  mev , @xmath83  mev , @xmath84  mev , and @xmath85  mev for the fit using eq .  . on the other hand , we have found @xmath86  mev , @xmath87  mev , @xmath88  mev , and @xmath89  mev for the fit using eq .  .",
    "both fits find roughly the same value of the gap @xmath65 and of the background parameter @xmath80 , but the scattering rates turn out to be quite different . in view of the latter observation it seems to be worthwhile to repeat the analysis of ref .",
    ", but with the ansatz eq .   for the electron green function .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this type of analysis can be applied also at temperatures above @xmath90 , and what is the resulting temperature dependence of the scattering rates @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the small value of the pair - breaking rate @xmath53 with respect to the large pair - conserving rate @xmath54 implied by fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] is consistent with the observation that the concept of the tomographic density of states is useful in the analysis of the arpes data.@xcite since in an anisotropic superconductor large - angle scattering is pair - breaking , the smallness of @xmath53 implies that the dominant scattering processes ( at least in the nodal region and at low temperatures ) have to be of the forward - scattering type .",
    "the importance of forward - scattering processes in the nodal region has been confirmed recently also by an analysis of the momentum distribution curves.@xcite as for the microscopic origin of the forward scattering , it has been argued that it can be caused by elastic scattering on disorder located outside the cuo@xmath91 planes.@xcite other explanations include scattering on ( quasi ) static long - range fluctuations , perhaps due to competing order , or scattering on low - energy long - wavelength emergent gauge fields.@xcite these different scenaria can be distinguished by different dependence on temperature and/or fermi - surface location and further experimental work is needed to discriminate between them .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the phenomenological self - energy  eq .  , which has been proposed theoretically in refs .   and applied recently in ref .",

    "our results provide a ( in principle ) straightforward recipe for extracting the scattering rates @xmath53 and @xmath62 from experimental data : the pair - breaking scattering rate @xmath53 is best determined from the tunneling ( or , in anisotropic superconductors , tomographic@xcite ) density of states , whereas the total scattering rate @xmath67 may be extracted from the widths of the quasiparticle peaks in spectral functions , see fig .",
