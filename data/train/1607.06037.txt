    "solvation in which separated solvent and solute molecules are combined to form a solution , is an elementary physical process in nature that provides a foundation for more complicated chemical and biological processes , such as ion channel permeation , protein - ligand binding , electron transfer , signal transduction , dna specification , transcription , post - transcription modification , gene expression , protein synthesis , etc .",
    "therefore , the understanding of solvation is a prerequisite for the quantitative study of other more complex chemical and biological processes and is of paramount importance to chemistry , physics and biology @xcite .",
    "the most basic and reliable experimental observation of solvation is the solvation free energy , which measures the free energy change in the solvation process . as a result ,",
    "one of the most important tasks in the solvation modeling and computation is the prediction of solvation free energies , which has recently drawn much attention in computational biophysics and chemistry @xcite .",
    "a large variety of solvation models has been developed in the past few decades for solvation analysis and solvation free energy prediction . in general",
    ", these models can be classified into either knowledge based models or physics based models .",
    "knowledge based models usually utilize a large amount of available data of solvation free energies to train statistical models for the solvation free energy prediction .",
    "one example of this type of models makes use of solvent accessible surface areas , solvent excluded surface areas or calibrated atomic surface areas for solvation free energy predictions @xcite .",
    "knowledge based models can provide relatively accurate predictions provided that enough experimental data are available . on the other hand , physics based solvation models are based on fundamental laws of physics .",
    "these models can be further classified into three major classes .",
    "one of them is explicit solvent models in which both solvent and solute molecules are described at the atomic or electronic level .",
    "this class of models is accurate in general , but is usually computationally expensive @xcite .",
    "another class of models is integral equation based solvation theories @xcite , in which the solute molecule is still modeled at the atomic level , while the solvent is modeled by statistical mechanics , such as liquid density functional theory , ornstein - zernike equation with hypernetted - chain , percus - yevick equation or other specified closure .",
    "integral equation based solvation models reduce the number of degrees of freedom dramatically compared to explicit solvent models .",
    "a major feature of integral equation approaches is that these methods are able to provide a good approximation of solvent microstructures near the solvent - solute interface @xcite .",
    "the other class of the physics based solvation models is implicit solvent models @xcite , in which the solute molecule can be modeled at either the atomic or the quantum mechanical level , while the solvent is described as a dielectric continuum .",
    "compared to other methods , implicit solvent models have advantages of involving a small number of degrees of freedom , highly accurate modeling of strong and long - range electrostatic interactions that often dominate solvation phenomena , and convenient treatments of solvent - solute electronic polarization effects @xcite . in implicit solvent models",
    ", the solvation free energy is typically divided into polar and nonpolar components .",
    "the polar solvation free energy is due to electrostatic interactions and can be modeled by a number of approaches , including born dielectric sphere model , kirkwood model @xcite , generalized born ( gb ) model @xcite , polarizable continuum model ( pcm ) @xcite and poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory @xcite . among these approaches , born dielectric sphere model which treats the solute molecule as the dielectric sphere with a centrally located atomic charge is the simplest one .",
    "the kirkwood model gives analytical expressions for electrostatic potentials in a spherical solute - solvent system with multiple charges inside the solute molecule @xcite .",
    "the gb model @xcite is able to deal with arbitrarily shaped molecules and account for the impact of each point charge by its effective distance ( i.e. , the born radius ) from the solvent - solute interface @xcite .",
    "the gb model is relatively faster , while depending on other methods , such as the pb theory , for its parametrization .",
    "the pcm describes solute electrons by using quantum mechanics so that solvation induced polarizations can be accounted in an iterative procedure .",
    "a few different versions of pcm models have been reported , including dielectric pcm , integral equation formalism pcm , and the variational pcm models @xcite .",
    "pcm is relatively computationally expensive due to its quantum mechanical charge calculation while its accuracy is bounded by the pb type of treatment of electrostatic potential as well as the quality of solvent - solute interfaces .",
    "the pb theory can be derived from more fundamental maxwell s equations @xcite .",
    "it is more accurate than the gb model and computationally more efficient than the pcm .",
    "the pb can be easily coupled with the quantum mechanics for a more accurate description of the solute charge density @xcite .",
    "it has become one of the most popular solvation models due to its relatively low computational cost and high modeling accuracy for biomolecules .",
    "the nonpolar solvation component has been modeled by a number of terms .",
    "a popular approach , based on the scaled - particle theory ( spt ) for nonpolar solutes in aqueous solutions @xcite , is to use a solvent - accessible surface area ( sasa ) term @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a solvent - accessible volume ( sav ) term is relevant in large length scale regimes @xcite .",
    "recent studies indicates that sasa based solvation models may not describe van der waals ( vdw ) interactions near solvent - solute interface @xcite . a combination of surface area , surface enclosed volume , and vdw potential has been shown to provide accurate nonpolar solvation predictions @xcite .",
    "the polar and nonpolar components are typically decoupled in traditional implicit solvent models .",
    "recently , new efforts have been made to couple polar and nonpolar components in the literature @xcite .",
    "differential geometry based solvation model makes use of the differential geometry theory of surfaces to dynamically couple polar and nonploar models by surface evolution , which is driven by free energy optimization @xcite . coupled with an optimization procedure ,",
    "this model was shown to deliver some of the best nonpolar solvent free energy analysis @xcite . by applying constrained optimization to nonpolar parameter selection",
    ", this model provides state - of - the - art solvation free energy fitting and cross validation results for a large number of solute molecules @xcite .",
    "it is important to validate solvation models by experimental data .",
    "samplx blind solvation prediction project , aimed at testing protein ligand binding models , also provides benchmark tests of the performance of the solvation models .",
    "many different solvation approaches have been tested by the samplx challenging molecules @xcite .",
    "implicit solvent models are among the most competitive approaches in samplx tests .",
    "the objective of the present work is to develop an automatic protocol to parametrize implicit solvent models for the _ blind _ solvation free energy prediction . in our approach , we utilize pb theories for computing electrostatic solvation free energies .",
    "both a point charge based pb model and a ksdft based polarizable pb model are developed in the present work . for the ksdft based pb model , an iterative process is developed to take care of the solvent polarization and solute response @xcite . in our nonpolar models",
    ", we employ either a collection of surface area , molecular volume and van der waals interactions or a combination of atomic surface areas and molecular volume . to determine parameters in our nonpolar models",
    ", we assume that similar molecules admit the same set of nonpolar parameters . in this work , we develop two parametrization algorithms . one of them is based on a functional group scoring , and the other is based on a nearest neighbor search .",
    "both algorithms utilize machine learning methods to optimize parameters .",
    "a database contains the solvation free energies in aqueous solvent for 668 solute molecules is collected from the literature @xcite to validate the proposed parametrization protocol .",
    "it is found that the present approach provides some of the best blind predictions of solvation free energies .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ modelmethod ]",
    ", we present our solvation models .",
    "both polar and nonpolar models are discussed .",
    "sections [ nonpolarenergymodel1 ] and [ nonpolarenergymodel2 ] present two nonpolar parametrization algorithms , namely , functional group scoring and nearest neighbor approaches . an algorithm for unified blind solvation free energy prediction is developed in section [ solvationmodel ] .",
    "the blind prediction of a large number of solvation free energies is carried out in section [ numericalresults ] .",
    "the leave - one - out test of 668 molecules is employed to validate the proposed protocol . finally , the accuracy and robustness of the proposed protocol is demonstrated by five sampl test sets .",
    "this paper ends with a conclusion .",
    "as an implicit approach , our solvation model has polar and nonpolar components @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the total solvation free energy , @xmath2 is the polar or electrostatic solvation free energy and @xmath3 is the nonpolar solvation free energy .",
    "the related polar and nonpolar solvation models are described in the next two sections .",
    "we utilize either the standard poisson model or a ksdft based poisson model for polar solvation free energy modeling and calculation .",

    "the detail description of this set is given in the literature @xcite .",
    "most molecules in this set are druggable and very complex .",
    "the difficulty of this test set comes from two aspects : on the one hand , the structures of molecules in this set are very complicated . on the other hand ,",
    "the knowledge in the training set that can be used for predicting the solvation free energies of these molecules is rare or insufficient .",
    "in addition to the molecular complexity , the reported experimental solvation free energies also admit large uncertainty @xcite .",
    "most earlier computational predictions report rms errors of 3 to 4 kcal / mol when some extremely complex molecules are excluded .",
    "some best prediction for the whole set has an rms error of 2.45 kcal / mol @xcite .",
    "the best performance was shown to give an rms error of 2.4 kcal / mol on a subset of the sampl1 test set that contains only 56 molecules @xcite .",
    "tables s5-s8 @xcite present the solvation free energies for the sampl1 test set obtained from both experiments and blind predictions using different charges and atomic radii .",
    "figure [ sampl1-figs ] plots the present blind predictions .",
    "one molecule ( bromacil ) that contains a br atom is considered by all the charge models except for the polarizable pb method .",
    "it is noted that two of present approaches , namely , the am1-bcc semi - empirical charges and the _ ab initio _ charge provide relatively accurate predictions for this test set . when amber mondi2 atomic radii together with the siesta charge calculation applied , the optimal solvation free energy prediction is achieved with rms error 2.82 kcal / mol .",
    "when bcc charges and the amber bondi radii are used , the prediction for the whole sampl1 set without a molecule that contains br atom has an rms error of 3.06 kcal / mol , the rms error is 3.07 kcal / mol for the same test with all molecules . for this test set ,",
    "the large prediction rms error mainly due to the extremely large error in predicting solvation free energies for some complex molecules , for which the rms error can be as large as 15 kcal / mol .",
    "this unreasonable prediction is due to the fact that inappropriate molecule force field parametrization yields unreasonable electrostatic solvation free energies , which in turn leads to erroneous solvation free energy prediction .",
    "similar to the sampl0 test set , the prediction is more sensitive to the charge parametrization .",
    "nevertheless , the atomic radius parametrization also plays an critical role in the prediction accuracy for this test set .",
    "sampl2 is another difficult test set with almost the same level of difficulty as the sampl1 test set @xcite .",
    "compared with sampl1 test set it contains a few complex molecules , and most molecules in this test set are drug like ones as well .",
    "contrary to molecules in sampl1 test set , this set has less uncertainty in the experimental solvation free energies .",
    "as shown in tables s9-s12 @xcite , the experimental solvation free energies of this test set distribute over a wide range .",
    "using all - atom molecular dynamics simulations and multiple starting conformations for blind prediction , klimovich and mobley reported an rms error of 2.82 kcal / mol over the whole set and 1.86 kcal / mol over all the molecules except several hydroxyl - rich compounds @xcite .",

    "tables s9-s12 @xcite list the details of the present predictions .",
    "the rms errors from various radius and charge force fields are given fig .",
    "[ sampl2-figs ] . apparently , this test set has a strong force field dependence as well .",
    "the rms errors vary very much from one charge force field to another . however , the performance of these predictions has a weak radius dependence .",
    "the best prediction , obtained from a combination of amber mbondi2 radius parameters and bcc charge force field , or amber bondi radius together with modified siesta charge , both have the rms error of 1.90 kcal / mol when the molecule with a br atom is excluded in the prediction .",
    "when all molecules are included , the combination of amber mbondi2 radius and bcc charge parametrization gives the optimal prediction of rms error 1.96 kcal / mol as depicted in the right chart of fig .",
    "[ sampl2-figs ] . compared to the prediction of sampl1 test set , these predictions are more accurate , due to two reasons .",
    "first , the molecules in this set are slightly simpler and experimental uncertainly is less severe for the deterministic prediction .",
    "second , in our parametrization of the nonpolar solvation free energy prediction , we have more similar molecules in training set , which enables us to obtain better nonpolar solvation free energy parameters in the nearest neighbor based approach . in contrast , in the sampl1 prediction , when the nearest neighbor approach is applied , the nearest molecules selected from the training set differ much from sampl1 molecules .",
    "sampl3 test set is a relatively easy one with 36 solute molecules @xcite .",
    "its molecular structures are less versatile than the earlier test sets .",
    "additionally , in this test set , there is no molecule that involves br or i atom .",
    "one of difficulties in the prediction of this set is the lack of similar molecules in our database when all the sampl3 molecules are left out .",
    "the best prediction in the literature offers an rms error of 1.29 kcal / mol @xcite .",
    "our blind predictions and experimental results for sampl3 test set are given in tables s13-s16 @xcite .",
    "the rms errors of our blind predictions for the sampl3 test set are plotted in fig .",
    "[ sampl3-figs ] . in this case",
    ", the accuracy of predictions also depends strongly on charge force fields and weakly on radius parameters .",
    "in general , gasteiger charges are superb for this test set and their rms errors are always smaller than 1 kcal / mol .",
    "our best prediction , obtained from the combination of zap9 radius parameters and gasteiger charge force field , has a small rms error of 0.78 kcal / mol and is depicted in the right chart of fig .",
    "[ sampl3-figs ] . in general gasteiger charge performs very poor in the solvation free energy prediction for previous tests on complex molecules , while we see that this charge parametrization method is superior for chlorinated hydrocarbon molecules in the present test set .",
    "unfortunately , there is no uniformly optimal parametrization for all the molecules .",
    "this fact motivates us to seek a solvation free energy prediction that does not heavily depends on the force fields parametrization .",
    "sampl4 test set is studied by using the proposed methods as well .",
    "a key feature of this test set is that its molecules are diversified .",
    "as shown in tables s17-s20 @xcite , this test set also involves a wide range of solvation free energies .",
    "however , the structures of these molecules are not as complex as those in both sampl1 and sampl2 test sets , which indicates a slightly easier task for solvation free energy prediction .",
    "this test set was studied by a number of researchers in the literature and the best prediction in the literature has the rms error of 1.2 kcal / mol @xcite .",
    "figure [ sampl4-figs ] illustrates the rms errors of our predictions for a total of 16 charge and radius combinations .",
    "compared with those in the literature , all of our predictions are of high quality .",

    "[ sampl4-figs ] .",
    "table [ rmserrorlist ] lists the rms errors of our blind predictions of solvation free energies for all five test sets using a total of 16 charge and radius implementations .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "first , all predictions are quite sensitive to charge force fields and relatively less dependent on radius parameter selection .",
    "additionally , it is difficult to identify a clear winner over all the test sets  some approaches perform better in one or two test sets , but do not do well in the rest test sets .",
    "this phenomenon highlights the difficulty of designing optimal models for solvation analysis .",
    "moreover , the ksdft based polarizable poisson model is more often to provide better predictions over most charge force fields and radius parameters .",
    "this indicates a potential to develop better physical models by improving the quantum charge density calculation",
    ". finally , we point out that the blind prediction results presented in the present work are the state - of - the - art compared to those in the literature @xcite .",
    "in this work , we propose a protocol to parametrize implicit solvent models for the blind prediction of solvation free energies .",
    "the proposed protocol parametrizes nonpolar solvation model by scoring and ranking algorithms while utilizes either the poisson model or a density functional theory ( dft ) based polarizable poisson model for polar solvation free energy calculations . for the parametrization of nonpolar solvation models",
    ", we first utilized the assumption that molecules with the same functional group admit the same parametrization of the nonpolar solvation energy functional . for complex poly - functional - group molecules ,",
    "we develop a scoring procedure to determine the optimal relative weight of each functional group . for extremely complex molecules that fails the functional group scoring method ,",
    "we further develop a molecule ranking algorithm to select an optimal set of nearest neighbor molecules for parameter training .",
    "we construct atomic features for the molecule ranking .",
    "finally , we systematically integrate the above mentioned models and algorithms into a robust protocol for blind solvation free energy prediction .    in the present work",
    ", we considered an experimental database of 668 solvation molecules , see table s21 @xcite , the largest database ever constructed for solvation , to validate our approach . among them , sampl0 to sampl4 test sets are paid special attention . for the poisson model or dft based polarizable poisson model , four sets of atomic radius parameters ( i.e. , amber 6 , amber bondi , amber mbondi and zap9 radii ) are combined with four sets of charge force fields ( i.e. , am1-bcc , mulliken , gasteiger and siesta dft ) to arrive at a total of 16 different implementations .",
    "the resulting polar solvation free energies are utilized in our parametrization for blind predictions .",
    "we first carry out the leave - one - out validation of the whole database .",
    "the am1-bcc charge force field delivers a low root mean square ( rms ) error of 1.33 kcal / mol , which is the lowest for such a large test database , to our best knowledge .",
    "we further conduct a series of leave - samplx - out blind tests . on average ,",
    "the bcc parametrization in the poisson model and dft based polarizable poisson model performs better than other charge force fields , especially for predicting the solvation free energies of the complex molecules .",
    "we obtain some of best known results .",
    "the optimal rms errors for sampl0-sampl4 are respectively , 0.93 , 2.82 , 1.90 , 0.78 , and 1.03 kcal / mol , which again , are some of the best to our best knowledge .    from the solvation free energy predictions , particularly on sampl1 and sampl2 test sets , we conclude that atomic charge parametrization is extremely important for the present physical models , namely , the poisson model or the ksdft based polarizable poisson model . without an appropriate charge parametrization , the prediction errors can be amplified for molecules with complex structures . in general , for four charge parametrization methods , both the semi - empirical bcc charge and the _ ab initio _ charge calculation from the generalized ksdft can provide relatively reliable charge assignments .",
    "for this reason , a solvation free energy prediction method that does not heavily depend on the molecule parametrization is under our consideration .",
    "essential idea is that if one does not partition the solvation free energy into two isolated parts , the prdeiction errors in the polar solvation free energy will not propagate to the nonpolar solvation free energy prediction .",
    "alternative , our differential geometry based solvation model that dynamically couple polar and nonpolar models @xcite might also provide a less sensitive approach .    this work can be improved in a number of ways .",
    "first , the classification of the database into functional groups is not unique .",
    "future study will explore optimal molecules partition .",
    "additionally , the selection and computation of atomic features need to be further investigated .",
    "it is possible to construct an optimal set of atomic features for solvation analysis and prediction .",
    "further , in the current work , molecular ranking for nearest neighbor searching is not optimal yet .",
    "more sophisticated machine learning and/or deep learning algorithms can be developed for this purpose . finally , a more versatile dft solvers can be utilized to further improve our in - house polarizable poisson model .",
    "these issues are under our consideration .",

    "<S> in this work , a systematic protocol is proposed to automatically parametrize implicit solvent models with polar and nonpolar components . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed protocol utilizes the classical poisson model or the kohn - sham density functional theory ( ksdft ) based polarizable poisson model for modeling polar solvation free energies . for the nonpolar component , either the standard model of surface area , molecular volume , and van der waals interactions , or a model with atomic surface areas and molecular volume </S>",
    "<S> is employed . </S>",
    "<S> based on the assumption that similar molecules have similar parametrizations , we develop scoring and ranking algorithms to classify solute molecules . four sets of radius parameters are combined with four sets of charge force fields to arrive at a total of 16 different parametrizations for the poisson model . </S>",
    "<S> a large database with 668 experimental data is utilized to validate the proposed protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest leave - one - out root mean square ( rms ) error for the database is 1.33k cal / mol . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , five subsets of the database , i.e. , sampl0-sampl4 , are employed to further demonstrate that the proposed protocol offers some of the best solvation predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal rms errors are 0.93 , 2.82 , 1.90 , 0.78 , and 1.03 kcal / mol , respectively for sampl0 , sampl1 , sampl2 , sampl3 , and sampl4 test sets . </S>",
