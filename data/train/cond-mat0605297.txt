    "one of the earliest and most important triumphs of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite was to elucidate the nature of metal - to - insulator transition ( mit ) driven by strong electron correlation .",
    "it was demonstrated that this transtion is accompanied by a kondo resonance at the fermi surface @xcite , width of which is proportional to the quasiparticle weight @xmath0 , and approaches to zero as the mott insulating side ( @xmath6 ) is approached from the metallic side . therefore in nonlinear optical spectra , we expect some signals that vanish in the limit @xmath6 , as a result of qusiparticle weight @xmath7 .",
    "equivalently one can employ the pressure to tune @xmath8 and hence switch from mott insulating side to a regime in which such signals arise due to kondo peak .",
    "this is a unique feature of correlated insulators , that has no analogue in band - insulators . in case of band insulators , to generate quasiparticle states in the mid - gap , one may need to dope them , while in mott insulators such mid - gap states can be created by applying pressure to a mott insulator which is in the onset of mit .",
    "possible examples would be a class of materials known as kondo insulators @xcite .",
    "( a typical example of this family is ybb@xmath9 @xcite ) .",
    "one of the applications of nonlinear opitcal materials is the third harmonic generation ( thg ) @xcite , that requires materials capable of providing strong enough nonlinear optical signals . to study this process in correlated electronic systems ,",
    "we have developed the theory of nonlinear optical response in the context of dmft @xcite which is also a suitable theoretical tool to study the effect of kondo resonance in nonlinear spectra . in @xmath10 limit where dmft becomes exact , vertex corrections to current operators identically",
    "vanish @xcite so that the thg sucseptibility within dmft approximation becomes @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 for @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the semicircular dos corresponding to the normalized hopping @xmath15 .    in the above formula",
    ", ( i ) the integration over @xmath16 corresponds to summation over intermediate states in conventional expressions @xcite which are usually used for systems with discrete energy levels , and ( ii ) the matrix element effects are encoded in @xmath17 , real and imaginary part of which have been denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "_ it is very crucial to note that we have used absolute value of the imaginary part of the self - energy_. this is indeed a necessary step to transform from time - ordered four - current , to fully retarded one@xcite .",
    "we obtain self - energy @xmath20 by solving the iterated perturbation theory equations of dmft for the semi - circular density of states @xcite . in dmft approximation , this quantity is purely local .    the critical value of hubbard @xmath21 corresponding to semicircular bethe lattice is @xmath22 , above which we are in mott insulating phase ( fig .",
    "[ mitdos.fig ] ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ mitdos.fig ] , the sharp kondo resonance state at fermi surface in the onset of transition to mott insulating phase , is characteristic of correlation driven mit .     of fig .",
    "[ thg-kondo.fig ] .",
    "such three - photon resonances appear as peaks * a * and * a * in fig . [ thg-kondo.fig ] , as explained in ref . @xcite .",
    "similarly * b * and * b * in this figure schematically represent two - photon resonances denoted by * b * and * b * in fig .",
    "[ thg-kondo.fig ] .",
    ", scaledwidth=55.0% ]",
    "fig . [ thg-kondo.fig ] shows the imaginary part of the thg susceptibility @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( [ thgconvolution.eq ] ) as a function of incident photon energy @xmath24 for various values of hubbard @xmath21 close to mit .",
    "dotted line corresponds to @xmath25 which is in the mott insulating phase .",
    "the mott - hubbard gap is manifested by a region in which im@xmath26 is identically zero .",
    "the onset of three - photon absorption as demonstrated earlier @xcite corresponds to the frequency where im@xmath26 takes up , and is 1/3 of the mott - hubbard gap ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "three - photon resonances in this formulation correspond to the peak * a * in im@xmath26 around @xmath28 ( dotted line ) , while two - photon features appear as a dip * b * around @xmath29 @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ thg-kondo.fig ] , except for slight shift in the location of the dip * b * , the two - photon features are not much affected by moving to lower values of @xmath21 in @xmath30 region .",
    "in contrast , the three - photon features is entirely distorted as we cross the @xmath8 and enter the kondo regime of @xmath30 .",
    "below the critical value @xmath22 the system is in metallic side , with a sharp kondo peak present at the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "for @xmath31 ( dashed line ) just below the critical value , there appear peaky structures below @xmath32 . among these structures , weak features denoted by * a * and * b * in fig . [ thg-kondo.fig ] start to appear in the thg gap region ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "these features seem to correspond to three - photon and two - photon rosonances between the lower hubbard band and the kondo resonance state ( schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ mitdos.fig ] ) , as they vanish in @xmath7 limit .",
    "moving further away from mit , quasiparticle weight @xmath0 grows and hence * a * and * b * features also start to grow proportional to @xmath0 . to see this proportionality , note that @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ thgconvolution.eq ] ) is dominated by @xmath34 effect , and hence in the limit @xmath7 one can replace the kondo peak with a sharp peak of strength @xmath0 . then decomposing to partial fractions , each with a single @xmath35 denominator in eq .",
    "( [ thgconvolution.eq ] ) , one can see that @xmath36photon features for @xmath37 will be proportional to @xmath0 .     across the mott metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "critical value of @xmath21 is @xmath38 .",
    "solid line corresponds to @xmath39 , dashed line corresponds to @xmath31 , and dotted line corresponds to @xmath25 , which is in the mott insulating side of mit transition .",
    "the onset of three - photon absorption for @xmath25 is where imaginary part of @xmath26 starts to become non - zero ( around @xmath40).,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    implication of this observation for kondo insulators is that , an external pressures on the order of a fraction of gpa can lead to instability in the functioning of optical devices built on them by filling in the gap and hence reducing the contrast of the output signal .",
