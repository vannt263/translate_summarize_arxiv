    "gro  j1744@xmath028  is a recently discovered accretion - powered pulsar which shows repetitive x - ray bursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "its unusual bursting behavior has been compared ( see below ) to that of the rapid burster ( mxb 1730@xmath0335 ) , which was discovered 20 years ago by lewin et al .",
    "analysis of the x - ray bursts from the rapid burster showed that it produced two distinct types of burst : type i , attributed to thermonuclear flashes on the surface of a neutron star ; and type ii , attributed to the release of gravitational potential energy due to spasmodic accretion .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the type ii bursts has not been fully understood , although it is almost certainly related to an accretion disk instability ( for reviews see lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993,1995 ) .",
    "rapidly repetitive type ii bursts had previously been observed only from the rapid burster , so if the bursts from gro  j1744@xmath028  are also of type ii  as convincingly argued by lewin et al .",
    "( 1996)then a comparison of these sources may constrain theories of the burst mechanism .",
    "the pulse period of gro  j1744@xmath028  is 467 ms and the neutron star is in a 11.8 day binary orbit about a low - mass donor star ( @xcite ) . during the first 12 hours of bursting observed with batse on december 2 , 1995",
    ", bursts occurred every 3 to 8 minutes , and for one three hour period the burst intervals clustered around @xmath4 s ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently the burst intervals became longer and more erratic and the burst rate settled at about 3040 per day ( corrected for earth occultation and live time ; @xcite ) .",
    "burst durations were initially @xmath1 2030 s , and settled down to @xmath1 510 s. unlike the type ii bursts from the rapid burster , no relationship between the burst fluence and the time to the next ( or previous ) burst has been reported28  shows a statistically significant but weak correlation between the burst fluence scaled to the persistent emission level and the time to the next burst ( kommers et al .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    using the first observations of gro",
    "j1744@xmath028  with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , swank ( 1996 ) noted that the bursts were followed by a characteristic `` dip '' in the persistent emission level which took a few minutes to recover .",
    "no such dips were seen before the bursts .",
    "subsequent _ rxte _",
    "observations showed that the bursts were sometimes preceded by steadily increasing variability in the persistent emission , including `` micro '' and `` mini '' bursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "extensive reviews of the rapid burster and its complex behavior can be found in lewin , van paradijs , & taam ( 1993 , 1995 ) ; see also references therein . here",
    "we discuss the features of the type ii bursts from this source that are relevant to our comparison with gro  j1744@xmath028 .",
    "the time intervals between type ii bursts from the rapid burster range from @xmath1 10 s to @xmath1 1 hr , with the shorter intervals being more common . burst durations range from @xmath5 s to @xmath6 s. the burst repetition pattern is that of a relaxation oscillator : the fluence of a type ii burst is roughly proportional to the time to the next burst ( @xcite ; lewin et al .",
    "persistent x - ray emission between the type ii bursts is observed following long ( duration @xmath7 s ) bursts .",
    "the persistent flux emerges gradually after high - fluence bursts and decreases prior to the next burst ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these pre- and post - burst features are referred to as `` dips '' in the persistent emission .",
    "the spectrum of the persistent emission is relatively soft during the dip just after a burst .",
    "it then rapidly increases in hardness , remaining hard for @xmath1 12 minutes before gradually decreasing to again become very soft during the dip preceding the next burst ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 12 minute period of spectrally hard emission corresponds to a `` hump '' in the persistent emission light curve .",
    "lubin et al . ( 1992 ) found `` naked eye '' quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) following 10 of 95 type ii bursts from the rapid burster observed with _",
    "exosat _  in august 1985 .",
    "the oscillations occurred _ only _ during the spectrally hard humps ( which immediately followed the post - burst dips ) .",
    "the frequency of the oscillations ranged from 0.039 to 0.056 hz , with a period decrease of 3050% observed over the @xmath3 s lifetime of the oscillations .",
    "the fractional root - mean - square ( rms ) variation in the oscillations was 5 to 15% . in 8 of the 10 cases ,",
    "the `` naked eye '' oscillations were accompanied by @xmath8 hz qpo with rms variations of 6 to 19% ( @xcite ) .",
    "several authors have already noted similarities between the bursts from gro  j1744@xmath028  and the rapid burster .",
    "after the discovery of the bursts from gro  j1744@xmath028 , kouveliotou et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that the release of gravitational potential energy following an accretion instability might be responsible for the bursts .",
    "lewin et al . ( 1996 ) made a detailed comparison between the two systems . noting that both are transient low - mass x - ray binaries in which the accretor is a neutron star",
    ", they concluded that the bursts from gro  j1744@xmath028  must be type ii based on ( i ) the hardness of the burst spectra , ( ii ) the lack of spectral evolution during the bursts , ( iii ) the fact that the ratio of integrated energy in the persistent emission to that in the bursts was initially too small to allow for a thermonuclear burst mechanism , and ( iv ) the presence of dips in the persistent emission following bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , sturner & dermer ( 1996 ) reached the same conclusion .",
    "the possibility of thermonuclear burning in gro  j1744@xmath028  has been discussed by bildsten & brown ( 1997 ) .    in this paper , we present another similarity between the rapid burster and gro  j1744@xmath028 .",
    "both sources show transient qpo during spectrally hard emission intervals following bursts .",
    "since january 18 , 1996 , _ rxte _  has performed numerous observations of gro  j1744@xmath028 .",
    "the data discussed here were taken by the pca instrument and are publicly available . between january 18 and april 26 , 1996 ,",
    "there were 94 main bursts observed ( @xcite ) . to refer to these bursts individually",
    ", we number them sequentially from 1 to 94 .    the light curves of the bursts reveal a rich phenomenology in the burst profiles .",
    "figure [ figlc ] ( a ) shows the `` dip '' in persistent emission which follows some bursts , as first noted by swank ( 1996 ) .",
    "a broad `` shoulder '' ( or `` plateau '' ) of emission above the mean pre - burst level immediately follows some bursts , as shown in figure [ figlc ] ( b ) .",
    "the shoulder occurs _ before _",
    "the dip whenever both features are present .",
    "some bursts show large - amplitude oscillations with frequencies @xmath9 hz during their shoulder , as shown in figure [ figlc ] ( c ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "oscillations can be seen during the shoulders of the light curves immediately following at least 10 of the 94 bursts .",
    "these ten bursts were numbers 8 , 12 , 14 , 18 , 43 , 53 , 65 , 68 , 77 , and 94 .",
    "typically 5 to 15 cycles of the qpo are apparent , with as many as @xmath10 cycles seen in the case of burst 65 . the low frequency of the oscillations and the low numbers of cycles make it difficult to use fourier power spectra to study these qpo . we have instead found the mean periods of the oscillations by estimating the time intervals between successive maxima in the count rates .",
    "the mean frequency of the oscillations over the ensemble of bursts is 0.38 @xmath11 0.04 hz . the mean frequency of the oscillations after individual bursts varies from 0.35 hz @xmath11 0.02 hz in burst 65 to 0.49 @xmath11 0.03 hz in burst 12 .",
    "( the uncertainty in these figures represents the uncertainty in the mean frequency . ) the period of the qpo following a given burst typically wanders non - monotonically about a mean period by @xmath1 20 percent over the lifetime of the oscillations . using the @xmath12 statistic we exclude ( at the @xmath13 level or better in each of the 10 bursts ) the null hypothesis that the period between successive qpo pulses is constant .    to identify any overall tendency towards increasing or decreasing qpo periods",
    ", we looked for bursts where the spearman rank - order correlation coefficient ( @xmath14 ) indicated that the time intervals between qpo pulses were correlated ( or anti - correlated ) with arrival time . in no case",
    "did we find a positive @xmath14 , which would have indicated an overall trend towards increasing periods .",
    "for bursts 18 , 53 , 65 ( see figure 2 ) , and 94 , we found an anti - correlation at the @xmath13 level or greater . in these bursts",
    "the qpo period tends to decrease by 10 to 20 percent over the lifetimes ( @xmath1 50 to 80 s ) of the oscillations .",
    "the fractional rms variations of the oscillations range from @xmath1 5 to 13% . using the counts to flux conversion @xmath15 erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 per count ( total pca band ; @xcite ) the rms variations in flux units range from @xmath18 erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 to @xmath19 erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 .    the shoulders during which the post - burst oscillations occur are spectrally harder than the persistent emission .",
    "figure [ fighardness ] ( top panel ) shows a hardness ratio for burst 65 .",
    "the hardness is defined as the count rate ( averaged over 1.0 s ) in the 35.6 kev range divided by that in the 23 kev range .",
    "the middle panel shows the power spectrum as a function of time .",
    "higher power levels are shown with darker shades .",
    "the presence of the qpo is shown by a dark band at 0.4 hz lasting from the end of the burst until @xmath20 s after the peak .",
    "the bottom panel shows the burst intensity profile .",
    "the spectrum of the burst counts is clearly harder than that of the persistent emission , but even after the main part of the burst subsides the hardness ratios during the presence of the qpo ( 20 to 100 s after the burst ) exceed those of the pre - burst persistent emission .",
    "the qpo following burst 65 show a modulation envelope reminiscent of `` beating '' between oscillations at separate frequencies ; see the bottom panel of figure [ fighardness ] .",
    "the count rates shown in the inset have been smoothed with a boxcar average to highlight the envelope of the ( roughly ) 0.05 hz `` beats '' .",
    "if this modulation envelope can be attributed to simple beating , the two narrow - band oscillations must occur concurrently and have roughly comparable amplitudes .",
    "an estimate of the two frequencies involved can be obtained from the mean frequency @xmath21 and the beat frequency @xmath22 .",
    "the mean frequency for the @xmath10 cycles of qpo following this burst is 0.35 @xmath11 0.02 hz .",
    "the two frequencies which are beating must then be roughly @xmath23 hz and @xmath24 hz . the average frequency wanders by about 20% , so if beating is responsible for the apparent modulation envelope then the frequencies of the two narrow - band oscillations wander as well .",
    "the presence of a similar phenomenon following other bursts is difficult to determine because fewer cycles are available .",
    "over the course of the january  may 1996 _ rxte _  observations , the burst fluence , peak flux , and persistent emission level each decreased ( approximately linearly ) by a factor of @xmath1 45 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the average frequency and rms amplitude of the post - burst qpo show no significant ( @xmath25 ) correlations with any of these quantities .",
    "qpo with nearly the same frequency are seen in bursts for which the persistent emission level differs by a factor of @xmath8 .",
    "although our analysis focused on the december 1995may 1996 outburst of gro  j1744@xmath028 , we note that post - burst oscillations were also detected following a burst in june 1996 .",
    "this burst occurred when the source temporarily resumed bursting activity at a lower level than the main december 1995may 1996 outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "kommers et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported 0.4 hz oscillations during a @xmath10 s `` shoulder '' following the sixth of 7 bursts observed with the pca on june 4 , 1996 .",
    "the fractional rms amplitude of these oscillations was @xmath26 percent .",
    "a second large outburst from gro  j1744@xmath028  has been in progress since december 2 , 1996 , but we have not yet analyzed these observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath1 0.4 hz oscillations following some bursts from gro  j1744@xmath028  are reminiscent of oscillations that have been seen following some type ii bursts from the rapid burster .",
    "this likeness between the two sources complements the comparisons made by lewin et al .",
    "although it is not certain that the post - burst oscillations are the same phenomenon in both sources , the following similarities are worth consideration .",
    "( i ) the post - burst oscillations follow bursts that do _ not _ show the profiles or spectral evolution characteristic of type i ( thermonuclear flash ) bursts .",
    "( ii ) the oscillations occur during a period of spectrally hard emission .",
    "( iii ) when an overall change in qpo period is observed , it is a decrease : 1020% for gro  j1744@xmath028 , and 3050% for the rapid burster .",
    "( iv ) the fractional rms amplitude of the oscillations is roughly 515% .",
    "there are some differences , however .",
    "( i ) the frequency of the post - burst oscillations in gro  j1744@xmath028  is roughly 0.4 hz while in the rapid burster , the post - burst oscillations have frequencies of 0.04 hz and are in some cases accompanied by 4 hz qpo .",
    "( ii ) in gro  j1744@xmath028 , the oscillations occur _ before _ the dip in the persistent emission ; but in the rapid burster , they appear _ after _ the dip ( @xcite ) .    cannizzo ( 1996a , 1996b ) has shown that a simple numerical model of a thermal - viscous accretion disk instability can reproduce some features of the gro  j1744@xmath028  bursts . in his model ,",
    "interplay between radial and vertical energy transport in the disk causes oscillations in the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure ( denoted by @xmath27 ) .",
    "these oscillations increase in amplitude and eventually become non - linear , leading to a lightman - eardley instability ( @xcite ) . for specific choices of the inner and outer disk radii ( @xmath28 cm , @xmath29 cm ) and",
    "the form of the viscous stress , integration of the time - dependent model reproduces the @xmath30 s recurrence times and the @xmath31 s durations of the bursts as well as the post - burst dips .",
    "cannizzo ( 1996b ) also points out that the increased variability _ before _",
    "bursts may be related to the oscillations in @xmath27 that precede the instability .",
    "these oscillations may occur in a variety of modes , but in his idealized case appear to have frequencies of about 0.05 hz ( @xcite ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this model can explain the oscillations reported here .",
    "abramowicz , chen , & taam ( 1995 ) have shown that low - frequency oscillations in mass flow can arise in accretion disk - corona systems . in their model ,",
    "the development of a lightman - eardley instability is moderated by energy dissipation in the coronal region , which lies above the thin disk .",
    "they propose that the strong @xmath32 hz oscillations seen in the rapid burster may arise from such a mechanism .",
    "the frequency of these qpo may be relatively insensitive to the accretion rate , since it is determined by several competing factors including the radius of the inner accretion disk .",
    "the spectrum of the qpo is expected to be hard whenever the qpo originate from the hot inner region ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the common feature responsible for oscillatory behavior in these models is the presence of a mechanism which couples the vertical energy transport to the radial energy flux . in cannizzo s model",
    ", this mechanism also acts to produce the bursts . to make a quantitative comparison of these models with the characteristics of the post - burst oscillations in gro  j1744@xmath028  and the rapid burster",
    ", one would have to know what qpo frequencies are expected based on the physical parameters that distinguish the two sources .",
    "the magnetic field strength and inner disk radius in particular should be quite different ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which might account for the factor of @xmath33 difference in post - burst qpo frequency .",
    "detailed information of this kind has not yet been presented for the models of cannizzo ( 1996a , b ) or abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "the presence of transient post - burst qpo is another similarity between the bursts from gro  j1744@xmath028  and the type ii bursts from the rapid burster .",
    "combined with the comparison of lewin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , this similarity is further evidence that the bursts from gro  j1744@xmath028  are of type ii .",
    "if the same disk instability is responsible for the type ii bursts from each of these sources , then the post - burst oscillations provide another observational benchmark for models of the burst mechanism as well as the qpo .",
