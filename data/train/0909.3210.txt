    "we study the bifurcation diagram of a nonlinear stochastic differential equation that includes delayed feedback .",
    "the model equation considered exhibits both pitchfork and hopf bifurcations .",
    "the bifurcation thresholds are obtained as a function of the model parameters , and our results contrasted with two related limits : the deterministic limit of a differential delay equation , and the stochastic bifurcation of the same model without delay .",
    "the study of differential delay equations @xcite is an important topic in applied mathematics , with widespread applications in physics ( lasers , liquid crystals ) , control systems in physiology ( neural and cardiac tissue activity ) @xcite , and economy ( agricultural commodity prices ) @xcite .",
    "recent interest has arisen in the mathematical modeling of cellular function at the molecular level , especially in transcriptional gene regulation @xcite .",
    "feedback regulation is a common motif in cellular networks , with delays arising from the complexity of the underlying network , or from the wide disparity in time scales of the many chemical processes involved in regulation @xcite .",
    "for example , dna is transcribed at a rate of 10 to 100 nucleotides per second , and it may take a delay of the order of minutes before the transcription factor appears as a finished product in the cell , and hence is available for regulation .",
    "significant delays can also be attributable to the time required for the diffusion of proteins through membranes , so that , for example , the auto regulated feedback on protein production at time @xmath7 is often proportional to protein concentration at time @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is known as the delay time . for short delay times , a reaction may be approximated as being instantaneous , and the system as being in quasi equilibrium . however , when the delay is comparable to the characteristic time scales of reaction , the non instantaneous nature of the interactions can no longer be ignored , and delay terms need to be included in the governing equations for the network under study @xcite .    experimental evidence has been mounting that highlights the importance of stochastic effects in transcriptional regulation @xcite , not only for natural networks , but for engineered gene circuits and networks as well @xcite . however , despite the wealth of evidence pointing to the importance of stochasticity in feedback regulation , delays in stochastic models of metabolic feedback are very often neglected , possibly because the resulting stochastic equations are no longer markovian , and hence rarely tractable analytically .",
    "exceptions include the derivation of a two time fokker - planck equation and the study of its small delay time limit in @xcite , and results on the bifurcation of the first and second moments of a linear stochastic equation with delay @xcite .",
    "we extend these latter results to the analysis of the stationary probability distribution function of a nonlinear model , and discuss in detail the stability of the solutions that results from the interplay of delay and stochasticity .",
    "we focus here on the normal form for a pitchfork bifurcation augmented with multiplicative or parametric noise ( additive noise has been shown to have no effect in the case of a delayed equation @xcite ) , and linear delayed feedback .",
    "the latter is sufficient to originate a hopf bifurcation in some region of parameters ( sufficiently strong negative feedback ) .",
    "our model for the dynamical variable @xmath10 is @xmath11 where the constant @xmath12 plays the role of the control parameter , @xmath13 is the intensity of a feedback loop of delay @xmath9 , and @xmath14 is a white , gaussian noise of intensity @xmath15 . the initial condition is a function @xmath16 specified on @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "we generally focus on the stationary probability distribution function @xmath0 for a range of values of @xmath18 and @xmath15 .",

    "( [ eq : stochmultddnonlin_ch3 ] ) with @xmath19 is known ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "( [ eq : stochmultddnonlin_ch3 ] ) , a stationary probability distribution of @xmath3 exists both below and above threshold , thus allowing a proper determination of the bifurcation point .",
    "the stationary distribution function of @xmath3 with @xmath22 has been found to be @xcite @xmath23 where the exponent @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a normalization constant .",
    "the solution ( [ eq : nlin_prob ] ) exists but is not normalizable for @xmath26 and hence it is not a physically admissible solution .",
    "therefore the stochastic bifurcation threshold is located at @xmath27 , point at which @xmath0 changes from a delta function at the the origin to a power law at small @xmath3 with an exponential cut off at large @xmath3 .",
    "contrary to what an analysis of the moments of @xmath10 would indicate , the existence of parametric fluctuations has no effect on the location of the bifurcation threshold : both deterministic and stochastic equations exhibit a pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath27 .",
    "we further note that in @xmath28 , @xmath0 is unimodal with a singularity at @xmath1 , whereas for @xmath29 the distribution is bimodal reflecting nonlinear saturation of @xmath3 .",
    "we now turn to the case of delay , @xmath30 . analytical results for the stability of the trivial solution @xmath1 for the _ linearization _ of eq .",

    "the bifurcation threshold of the first moment @xmath31 is shifted relative to the deterministic delay equation result ; only bounds can be given for the stability of the second moment @xmath32 @xcite , and no results are available for @xmath0 .",

    "as discussed further below , we observe long transients in @xmath10 until it eventually decays to @xmath1 . at a critical value @xmath39 , the bifurcation point , a broad distribution emerges , although the most likely value remains @xmath40 . at larger values of @xmath12 ,",

    "we expect @xmath42 .",
