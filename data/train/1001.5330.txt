    "over the past three decades , the orbital dynamics of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electrons coupled to a uniform perpendicular magnetic field has been a subject of special interest in condensed matter physics .",
    "great attention has been paid to investigate the well - known hofstadter butterfly - like diagram , a remarkable intricate , detailed , and self - similar feature for the subband spectrum of single - particle eigenenergies , in different 2d structures such as square @xcite , triangular @xcite , honeycomb @xcite , and kagom lattices @xcite , lateral superlattices @xcite , superstructures with flat bands @xcite , quasiperiodic tilings @xcite , fractal networks @xcite , and rhombus tilings @xcite . this magnetic - field - induced frustration in 2d structures , caused by the competition between the periodic potential imposed by the lattice structure and the length scale provided by the magnetic field , is the headstream of rich and novel physical phenomena in these 2d systems . among them",
    "the orbital magnetization is a very interesting one and needs to be paid special attention due to its intrinsic relationship with the unique topological structure brought about by the interplay between the special lattice geometry and magnetic subbands .",
    "unfortunately , to date , there are very scarce studies @xcite in literature that devote to enlightening this revealing relationship .    motivated by this observation , in this paper , we study the orbital magnetization properties of the electron gas on a two - dimensional kagom lattice under a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "since our attention is solely on the orbital character in magnetization brought about by the interplay between the kagom lattice structure and the magnetic field , thus unlike most of previous work , the kagom lattice considered in this paper is spin nonmagnetic in itself , namely , no spin structure is exposed in the absence of the external magnetic field .",
    "the nonmagnetic kagom lattice structure has been either fabricated by modern patterning techniques @xcite or observed in reconstructed semiconductor surfaces @xcite . in the former case , remarkably , the electron filling factor ( namely , the fermi energy ) can be readily controlled by applying a gate voltage @xcite .",
    "our lattice model is free from the constraint imposed on the @xmath5 approximation used in the extensively studied gaas two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , in which the @xmath5 hamiltonian is only valid around the @xmath6 point in the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "in contrast , our lattice model allows for any electron filling , which result in various fermi - surface topologies in the magnetic bz , which in turn , as will be shown below , produces profound effects on the orbital magnetization properties and the related transport phenomenon .",
    "the orbital magnetization for bloch electrons combines two terms @xcite , one is the conventional orbital magnetic moment to characterize the magnetic response of the single - particle energy spectrum , and the other is a berry - phase correction .",
    "these two terms play different roles in metallic and insulating regions @xcite . by varying the fermi energy ,",
    "we obtain the follows : ( i ) both the magnitudes of these two terms increase ( decrease ) with increasing ( decreasing ) the fermi energy in metallic regions ; ( ii ) in insulating regions the conventional term keeps a constant unchanged value ( quantum step ) , while the berry - phase linearly varies with the fermi energy with a slope proportional to the system s hall conductance ; ( iii ) a general fractal structure may occur in the orbital magnetization curve ( as a function of the fermi energy ) by tuning the commensurate flux .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give the hofstadter spectrum of the kagom lattice by diagonalizing the corresponding tight - binding hamiltonian in an external magnetic field . in sec .",
    "iii the orbital magnetization and its two components are systematically discussed by varying various system parameters .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",

    "hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) can be diagonalized in the momentum space as@xmath19 where @xmath20=(@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23)@xmath24 is the three - component electron field operator .",
    "each component of @xmath20 is the fourier transform of @xmath17 , i.e.,@xmath25 where we have changed notation @xmath26 by using @xmath27 to label the kagom unit cells and @xmath28 to label the three sites in a unit cell .",

    "the first bz is a hexagon with the corners of @xmath39=@xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .    in the presence of a magnetic filed ( @xmath43 ) , the hopping term of the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] )",

    "one can take different gauge potential @xmath44 mathematically to satisfy the physical confinement @xmath51**=**@xmath11 .",
    "however , the flux through one unit cell is only linearly dependent on the external magnetic field @xmath11 , and has no relation with the choice of the gauge potential @xmath44 .",
    "so , it is convenient to measure the magnetic field in units of the flux quantum per elementary triangular plaquette of the kagom lattice . after a simple algebraic calculation ,",
    "one obtains the flux through one triangle is @xmath52=@xmath53 .",
    "thus we can define a parameter , called the filling ratio @xmath1 , as the fraction of a flux quantum throng each triangle , i.e , @xmath1=@xmath54=@xmath55 @xcite . the total flux through a unit cell of the kagom lattice is then given as @xmath56 .     when the fermi energy lies in these gaps",

    ", the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) should be diagonalized in a magnetic  unit cell , which contains @xmath59 plaquette in order to guarantee @xmath60 being good quantum numbers . as a result ,",
    "the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) is @xmath59 times smaller than the usual bz .",
    "furthermore , because of the magnetic translation symmetry , the mbz has exactly a @xmath59-fold degeneracy . for convenience",
    "we take the gauge potential as @xmath44**=**@xmath61 . under this gauge ,",
    "the peierls phases , which reflect the information about the external magnetic field , are only related to @xmath62 and have nothing with @xmath63 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the kagom lattice now can be diagonalized in the momentum space as the following @xmath64 matrix ,    @xmath65   , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66   , \\\\ h_{n}^{cb }   &   = t\\exp(-i\\mathbf{k\\cdot a}_{2})\\exp\\left [   i8\\pi f\\left ( n+\\frac{1}{12}\\right )   \\right ]   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath67 with the above hamiltonian ( [ 3q ] ) , it is straightforward to obtain the hofstadter butterfly - like energy spectrum of the kagom lattice , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .    from fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , one can easily observe three symmetries of this hofstadter butterfly - like spectrum of the kagom lattice @xcite : ( i ) the spectrum at @xmath1 is the same as that at @xmath68 with @xmath47 any integer ; ( ii ) the spectrum is also unchanged on changing @xmath1 to @xmath69 , because if there is an eigenstate with energy @xmath70 for field @xmath1 , then the corresponding complex conjugate of this eigenstate is also an eigenstate with the same energy @xmath70 for field @xmath69 ; ( iii ) the spectrum is inverted when the field @xmath1 changes to @xmath71 .",
    "thus the highest - energy states for field near @xmath1=@xmath72 are equivalent to the lowest - energy states near zero field .",
    "to obtain the orbital magnetization of the kagom lattice in an external magnetic field and with finite temperature , let us first write down the single - particle free energy as follows @xcite : @xmath73   \\ln[1+e^{\\beta ( \\mu-\\epsilon_{n\\mathbf{k}})}].\\label{free}%\\ ] ] here , @xmath74 is the berry curvature of electronic bloch states defined by @xmath74=@xmath75 with @xmath76 being the periodic part of bloch wave for the @xmath62th band .",
    "its integral over the mbz gives the topological invariant , namely , the chern number @xmath77 .",

    "the conventional term @xmath96 keeps a constant , which is due to the fact that the upper limit of the @xmath0-integral of @xmath109 is invariant as the chemical potential varies in the gap . in the metallic region , however , since the occupied states varies with the fermi energy , thus @xmath96 also varies with @xmath94 , resulting in a decreasing slope shown in fig .",

    "we have known that the topology of the energy spectrum of the 2d lattice system arises from the competition between the periodic potential - induced level broadening and the magnetic field - induced level discretization . once the external magnetic field changes , the topology of the energy spectrum also changes , which results in the simultaneous prominent variation in the magnetization of the 2d system .",
    "the above discussions on the magnetization for different fields @xmath1=@xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are typical examples . now a question is put forward : if there is a very small perturbation @xmath117 to the field @xmath1 , then how about the change in the magnetization ?",

    "the perturbation @xmath117 is more small , the magnetization oscillates more rapidly ; ( iii ) the collapsed middle band originally at field @xmath1=@xmath2 now spreads at @xmath110=@xmath111 . and in this middle band there are also dhva oscillations appearing in the orbital magnetization . to see this fractal feature more clearly , we enlarge the magnetization in the inset in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ; ( iv ) there are similar variations in the two components of @xmath95 ( see fig . [ f8 ] ) . in the insulating regions at @xmath1=@xmath2 ,",
    "there are little difference in the conventional and berry - phase terms . however , both terms exhibit different behaviors in the metallic regions . while the berry - phase term has little difference at different fields as it in the insulating regions , there are many quantum steps appearing in the conventional term at @xmath110=@xmath111 .",
    "the reason for these quantum steps appearing in the conventional magnetization is that the topology of the energy spectrum at the field @xmath110=@xmath119 is different from that at the field @xmath1 .",
    "when the external field @xmath1 changes to @xmath119 , the eigenbands at the field @xmath1 split into lots of subbands .",
    "the perturbation @xmath117 is more small , the number of the splitting subbands is more large . because the upper limit of the @xmath0-integral of @xmath109 is invariant as the fermi level @xmath94 varies in the subgap , then the conventional term in the subgap keeps a constant , which is the reason for the quantum step appearing in the conventional term . on the other hand ,",
    "the integral of the berry - phase term intimately depends on the fermi level and has no such relation with the energy gaps ( or bands ) .",
    "that results in the little difference in the berry - phase term at different fields .",
    "so , when one changes the electron s fillings through these splitting bands , the total magnetization then exhibits the fractal structure in the magnetic dhva oscillations .    in the above discussions on the orbital magnetization of the 2d kagom lattice , we have concentrated on the zero - temperature limit and omitted finite - temperature effect .",
    "now let us briefly consider the more realistic cases in which the finite - temperature effect is included .",
