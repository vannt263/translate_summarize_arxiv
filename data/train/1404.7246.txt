    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) first realized experimentally in 1995 for rubidium  @xcite , lithium  @xcite , and sodium  @xcite , provide unique opportunities for exploring quantum phenomena on a macroscopic scale .",
    "the properties of a condensate at absolute zero temperature are usually described by the time - dependent , nonlinear , mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the interatomic interaction leads to a nonlinear term in the gp equation .",
    "the s - wave scattering length , @xmath0 , plays an important role in the description of atom - atom interaction at ultralow temperatures @xmath1 .",
    "the magnitude and sign of the s - wave scattering length , @xmath0 , can be tuned to any value , large or small , positive or negative by applying an external magnetic field .",
    "it is given by @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath3 is the time - dependent externally applied magnetic field , @xmath4 is the width of resonance and @xmath5 is the resonant value of the magnetic field .",
    "the presence of attractive interaction ( @xmath6 ) between the atoms has a profound effect on the stability of a bec , since a large enough attractive interaction will cause the bec to become unstable and collapse in some way .",
    "it is understood that at low temperature and density , where interatomic distances are much greater than the distance scale of atom - atom interactions , two - body interaction can be described by a single parameter ( scattering length ) where the effects of three - body interaction are negligible . at low enough temperatures",
    "the magnitude of the scattering length @xmath0 is much less than the thermal de broglie wavelength and the exact shape of the two - atom interaction is unimportant . on the other hand , if the atom density is considerably high the three - body interaction can start to play an important role  @xcite . for an attractive interatomic interaction the condensate is stable for upto a maximum critical number of atoms .",
    "when the number of atoms increases beyond this critical value , due to interatomic attraction , the radius of the bec tends to zero and the maximum density of the condensate tends to infinity . with a supply of atoms from an external source",
    "the condensate can grow again and thus a series of collapses can take place , this has been observed experimentally in bec of @xmath7li with attractive interaction  @xcite . theoretical analysis based on the gp equation",
    "also confirms the collapse .",
    "thus for a system of atoms with attractive two - body interaction , the condensate has no stable solution above a certain critical number of atoms @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "however , as reported by gammal et al  @xcite , the addition of a repulsive potential derived from three - body interaction is consistent with a number of atoms larger than @xmath8 . even for a very small strength of the three - body interaction , the region of stability for the condensate",
    "can be extended considerably . by considering the possible effective interaction ,",
    "it has been reported that a sufficiently dilute and cold bose gas exhibits similar three - body dynamics for both signs of the s - wave scattering length  @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested that , for a large number of bosons the three - body repulsion can overcome the two - body attraction , and a stable condensate will appear in the trap  @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that ping et al .",
    "have studied the two- and three - body interactions through analytical studies in a trapped bec using the so called gross - pitaevskii - ginzburg equation  @xcite .",
    "weakly interacting becs atoms have stimulated intensive interest in the field of atomic matter waves and nonlinear excitations such as dark @xcite and bright solitons @xcite .",
    "a numerical study of the time - dependent gp equation is of interest , as this can provide solutions to many stationary and time - evolution problems .",
    "the time - independent gp equation yields only the solution of stationary problems .",
    "as our principal interest is in time evolution problems , we shall only consider the time - dependent gp equation in this paper .",
    "as the problem of the stabilization of a soliton in a trapless condensate is of utmost interest in several areas , for example , nonlinear physics  @xcite , optics  @xcite and becs , in the present study we reexamine the problem of stabilization and point out that a temporal modification of the scattering length can lead to a stabilization of the trapless soliton in three dimensions . in this paper , in addition to analytical studies , we also perform numerical verification for the stability of trapless bec in the presence of three - body interaction .",
    "in particular , by analyzing the gp equation using variational method and direct numerical integration , we address stabilization properties in most of the possible cases where the two- and three - body interactions can be realized .",
    "our present analysis strongly suggests that the inclusion of three - body interaction of suitable form can stabilize the trapless bec .",
    "we also illustrate from numerical simulations that the untrapped attractive condensate can maintain a reasonably constant spatial profile over a sufficient interval of time through temporal modulation .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we present a brief overview of the mean - field model .",
    "then , we discuss the variational study of the problem and point out the possible stabilization of a trapless bec with three - body interaction in section  [ sec3 ] . in section  [ sec4 ] , we report the numerical results of the time - dependent gp equation with two- and three - body interactions through split - step crank - nicholson ( sscn ) method and we investigate the stability of a trapless bec for two different cases .",
    "finally , we give the concluding remarks in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "at ultra low temperatures the time dependent wave function of the condensates @xmath9 at position @xmath10 and time @xmath11 in the presence of three - body interaction can be described by the following mean - field nonlinear gp equation @xcite @xmath12\\psi(\\tilde{\\textbf{r}},\\tau ) = 0 , \\label{jac1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the number of atoms in the condensate , @xmath14 , is the spherically symmetric trap geometry , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the strengths of time dependent two - body and three - body interatomic interactions , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 is planck s constant and @xmath18 is mass of the single bosonic atom , @xmath0 is time dependent s - wave scattering length which can be tuned to any desired value by using feshbach resonance technique .",
    "the normalization condition is @xmath19 .",
    "usually the strength of the three - body interaction is very small when compared with strength of the two - body interaction as pointed out by gammal  @xcite .",
    "accordingly we have considered @xmath20 percent of @xmath21 for our present study .",
    "it may be noted that , since @xmath16 is function of @xmath21 , the three body interactions can also be controlled by the tuning of s - wave scattering length  @xcite . in the present work , we essentially look for stabilization of trapless bec",
    ". when one expects solitons in bec using gp equation , the system should be conservative .",
    "it means that the gp equation should not have any dissipative term like gain / loss etc .",
    "if we include the effect of gain / loss of atoms then the corresponding gp equation will be a non - conservative system and hence there is no soliton in the conventional sense .",
    "however , one can still look for non - autonomous solitons by suitably tailoring the gain / loss of atoms . for example , such non - autonomous solitons have been studied by rajendran et al .",
    "@xcite , serkin et al .",
    "the nature of such solitons in the case with both two- and three - body interactions and gain / loss of atoms have been considered to some extent by roy et al .",
    "however , in the present study , we mainly focus on the stabilization of trapless bec for conservative system .",
    "it is more convenient to use the gp equation ( 1 ) into a dimensionless form . for this purpose",
    "we make the transformation of variables as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "then , the radial part of the gp equation ( [ jac1 ] ) becomes @xcite , @xmath26\\phi(r , t ) = 0 , \\label{jac2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath27 represents a spatial dimension , the parameter @xmath28 represents the strength of the external trap which is to be reduced from @xmath29 to @xmath30 when the trap is switched off . the normalization condition in this case is @xmath31 .",
    "in the following , we use the variational approach with the trial wave function ( gaussian ansatz ) for the solution of equation ( [ jac2 ] ) where the external potential is absent  @xcite : @xmath32 } , \\label{jac3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath33^{-1}$ ] for d:3 and @xmath34^{-1}$ ] for d:2 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the normalization , width , chirp and phase of the system , respectively . the lagrangian density for equation ( [ jac2 ] ) is given by @xmath38 the trail wave function equation ( [ jac3 ] ) is substituted in the lagrangian density and the effective lagrangian is calculated by integrating the lagrangian density as @xmath39 .",
    "the euler - lagrangian equations for @xmath35 and @xmath36 are then obtained from the effective lagrangian in a standard fashion as , @xmath40 by combining the equations ( [ jac6 ] ) and ( [ jac7 ] ) , we get the following second - order differential equation for the evolution of the width , @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 are constant part of the scattering length of two - body , three - body interaction respectively and @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the amplitude of oscillating part of the scattering length . now @xmath35 can be separated into a slowly varying part @xmath48 and a rapidly varying part @xmath49 by @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath51 , @xmath49 becomes of the order of @xmath52 .",
    "keeping the terms of the order of up to @xmath52 in @xmath49 , one may obtain the following equations of motion for @xmath48 and @xmath49  @xcite , @xmath53 @xmath54 where the overline indicates the time average of the rapid oscillation . from equation ( [ jac9 ] ) we can get @xmath49 and substituting it into equation ( [ jac10 ] ) , we obtain the following equation of motion for the slowly varying part , @xmath55 and the effective potential @xmath56 corresponding to the above equation of motion can be written as , @xmath57 if one considers the two - body interaction alone , that is , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the effective potential can be reduced as , @xmath60 which is exactly the same as discussed in ref @xcite .",
    "now we analyze the nature of the effective potential in the presence and in the absence of three - body interaction .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] depicts the potential energy     of equation  ( [ jac13 ] ) as a function of @xmath61 with ( solid line ) and without ( dotted line ) three - body interaction for different @xmath62 values and for @xmath63 . ]",
    "curves as a function of @xmath61 in the absence and in the presence of three - body interaction for different frequencies of the periodic force .",
    "one may infer from figure 1 that for the potential energy curve does not show any minimum @xmath64 in order to have a stable condensates . on increasing the frequency to @xmath65",
    ", a minimum dip appears in the potential for both the cases .",
    "it is also evident that the inclusion of three - body interaction deepens the minimum as represented by the solid line in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "we consider the case with @xmath66 for further analysis .",
    "next we look into the stability of the condensate upon varying the nonlinearity @xmath67 with two - body interaction alone .",
    "thus the inclusion of three - body interaction seems to increase the stability of the condensates .",
    ".results of variational approximation [ cols=\"^ , < , > \" , ]     the stability of trapless bec with two - body interaction for constant ( slowly varying ) and oscillatory ( rapidly varying ) part has been already explored  @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , the effect on the inclusion of three - body interaction has not been studied in trapless bec . hence , in the present study , we are interested to analyze the effect of three - body interaction on the stability of trapless bec . to analyze the effect of three - body interaction , we consider four types of different possible combinations of two- and three - body interactions as mentioned in table  [ table1 ] , namely , ( a ) two - body interaction alone ( both constant and oscillatory part ) ,     versus @xmath61 and @xmath63 . curve ( a ) indicates the case in the two - body interaction alone . curve ( b ) indicates the presence of two- and three - body interactions . curve ( c ) indicates the two - body interaction with the presence of the constant part of the three - body interaction only .",

    "we have observed in figure  [ f2](a ) that there is no potential depth for @xmath68 .",

    "it is clearly shown the same in figure  [ f2](b ) that the size of condensates stable up to three time units and in the final stage it eventually collapses .",
    "if @xmath67 increase to -25.00 , the depth of the minimum in the effective potential increased .",
