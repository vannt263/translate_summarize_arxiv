    "selection criteria using near - infrared and mid - infrared photometry or combination of infrared ( ir ) and multiwavelength data have demonstrated the striking existence of a conspicuous population of obscured active galactic nuclei ( agns ) that has remained unknown until fairly recently , being difficult to detect with traditional selection criteria in the optical band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "on the one hand , dust extinction hampers a complete census of the active smbhs in the universe in case of optical / uv surveys , on the other hand , the agn light is absorbed by the obscuring medium and then re - emitted at near- and mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , @xcite have recently unveiled a population of highly - reddened ( @xmath8 @xmath9 2 ) quasars at an average redshift of @xmath10@xmath0@xmath11 0.22 whose number density is almost comparable to that of the optically - selected quasars , selected on the basis of the uv - blue color excess criterion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these 2mass sources are previously unidentified quasars @xcite .",
    "optical follow - up observations have revealed that the bulk of this extragalactic population is composed by broad - line agns with a significant number of intermediate type objects ( i.e. type 1.21.9 ) . in particular , it has been found that : ( i ) their median spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is redder in the optical / uv band than that of the best - studied , classical _ blue _ quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( ii ) they are primarily reddened by dust ( a@xmath12 @xmath13 15 mag ) rather than being intrinsically red sources , ( iii ) these objects usually exhibit a high optical polarization level ( @xmath3 315% ) suggesting that the polarization is due to scattering of nuclear light by material located close to the active nucleus , but exterior to the blr @xcite .",
    "such an aspect is very intriguing since @xmath1320% of 2mass agns exhibit the same broad emission lines both in the polarized flux and in the total flux spectrum .",
    "this indicates that a sizable fraction of the observed optical agn emission must have scattered into our direction and , in turn , suggests caution in the use of spectral type ( type 1 versus type 2 ) as indicator of orientation in agns @xcite .",
    "the observed properties of  quasars can be interpreted in terms of intermediate viewing angles where the agn is viewed through the edge ( or atmosphere ) of the torus or a clumpy accretion disk wind .",
    "accordingly , the observed broad - band emission is the likely combination of direct , reprocessed and scattered emission components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , as pointed out by @xcite , both obscuration and emission from the circumnuclear gas and the host galaxy play a crucial role in shaping the sed of  2mass quasars .",
    "it is also worth noting that a small ( @xmath31015% ) percentage of classical , _ blue _ quasars is unavoidably collected , especially at @xmath0  0.4 , by the @xmath1 2 selection criterion @xcite .",
    "also in @xcite , it is shown that some unreddened ( i.e. a@xmath12 = 01 mag ) type 1 sources with high eddington ratios ( @xmath14 ) and large amounts of hot circumnuclear dust are picked up within their sample of  2mass quasars . however , since the @xmath15 color selection is inhomogeneous with redshift , at higher redshifts less contamination from _ blue _ agns will occur ( as @xmath15 color resembles more a rest frame optical color ) and the red @xmath15 selection will mostly gather agns that are truly dust - reddened .",
    "more sophisticated selection processes involving multiwavelength ( i.e. radio , optical , infrared ) data have recently allowed to reveal _ red _ quasars ( i.e. with @xmath11.7 and @xmath24.0 ) up to @xmath0  1 , such as in the case of the vla first-2mass ( ftm hereafter ) survey published by @xcite .",
    "they estimate that _ red _ quasars account for between 25% and 60% of the total quasar population with @xmath16 14 mag .",
    "the nature and the evolutionary properties of _ red _ quasars are still open issues .",
    "it is worth noting that the classical , non-  agn population , i.e. with a 2mass color @xmath17 2 , indeed comprises a mixed bag of objects spanning from unobscured _ blue _ quasars to seyfert 2-like agns showing only narrow lines in their optical spectra and absorbed ( even with compton - thick , i.e.  @xmath9 10@xmath18 2 , column densities ) at x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "are they standard systems observed along a special line of sight for which both nuclear and host galaxy obscuration are important @xcite , i.e. alternative to that of two classical populations of unobscured broad - lined quasars and that of heavily obscured , narrow - lined quasars ?",
    "alternatively , can they ( especially if they are at @xmath0 0.40.5 ) be interpreted as a peculiar dust - cocooned stage in the life cycle of quasars , possibly associated with the assembly of the host galaxy ?",
    "intriguingly , hst images available for a sample of dust - reddened ftm quasars with @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath723 and 0.4  @xmath0  1 show disturbed optical morphologies in the vast majority ( 85% ) of them with evidence of ongoing merging , interactions and multiple nuclei @xcite , unlike _ blue _ quasars being mostly hosted in undisturbed elliptical or bulge - dominated galaxies as found in hst imaging studies of optically - selected luminous quasars at @xmath0 @xmath21 1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "evidence is mounting that distant _ red _ quasars might indeed represent a dust - enshrouded phase in quasar evolution linked with the host galaxy assembly via repeated mergers @xcite .",
    "this phase should be characterized by the presence of massive nuclear winds expelling / heating most of the cold gas reservoir and merger debris in the host galaxy , and so rendering progressively visible the quasar as an optically - bright source ( the so - called _ feedback _ processes , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a deep exploration of the x - ray spectral properties of  quasars is therefore important to improve our understanding of the structure of agns and their cosmological evolution .",
    "the combination of a favorable line of sight inclination and obscuration can indeed provide a unique view of spectral components usually overwhelmed by the agn light in _ blue _ quasars @xcite .",

    "this matches with the finding that only @xmath310% of the  2mass agns are detected in the rosat faint source survey @xcite .",

    "all these luminous  quasars lie in the redshift range 0.4@xmath02.7 , exhibit broad lines in their optical spectra and they are radio - quiet or radio - intermediate , i.e. with a ratio of radio to optical emission r@xmath35=@xmath36100 .",
    "the value of r@xmath35 derived for  is @xmath3 30 , and the steep radio spectral index ( @xmath37 = @xmath71.06 ) derived by @xcite also supports the moderate radio - loud nature of this quasar .",

    "interestingly , @xcite also found a possible correlation between the magnitude of galaxy interactions and the level of obscuration affecting the quasar .",

    "after screening the final net exposure times were 41 and 48 ks for pn and mos , respectively .",
    "the source photons were extracted for the pn(mos ) camera from a circular region with a radius of 29(30 ) arcsec centered at the peak of the emission , while the background counts were estimated from a 52(49 ) arcsec radius source - free region on the same chip and close to  without being contaminated by the target itself .",
    "the redistribution matrix files and ancillary response files were created using the sas task rmfgen and arfgen , respectively . as the difference between the mos1 and the mos2 response matrices is a few percent , we created a combined mos spectrum and response matrix .",

    "this fit was statistically unacceptable with  = 1.95/324 , revealing additional spectral complexity .",
    "in particular , an excess in the data / model residuals emerges at energies below 0.6 kev ( e.g. fig .",

    "we note that leaving the photon index of the unabsorbed power law free to vary in both np and wp models gave values that are consistent with the photon index of the continuum and did not produce any appreciable improvement in the quality of the fits . + it is worth noting that a fitting model with an absorber completely covering the nucleus plus an extra - continuum x - ray emission component ( like both np and wp model ) is numerically equivalent to a model with a partially - covering absorber . in the partial covering scenario the soft x - ray emission",
    "is alternatively interpreted as a portion of primary radiation leaking through the absorber with a covering fraction equal to @xmath56 = ( 1 @xmath7 @xmath55 ) ; see table 2 . instead , in case of fully - covering absorber , the _ soft excess _",
    "is explained in terms of emission due to reprocessing of the nuclear continuum by surrounding material .",
    "this reprocessed component may be electron - scattered emission by highly ionized matter extending above the `` hole '' of the _ torus _ or compton reflected by cold material , and/or it may arise from large - scale ( @xmath130.1 - 1 kpc ; see @xcite ) photoionized gas as pointed out in most of high - resolution soft x - ray spectra of heavily - obscured type 2 agns which are dominated by a wealth of strong emission lines from hydrogen- and helium - like ions of the most abundant metals , from carbon to sulfur @xcite .    unfortunately , the combination of  resolution , intermediate column density of the x - ray absorber and moderate soft x - ray flux of  heavily hampers the detection of these emission lines in the  spectrum presented here .",

    "the match between the column density measured via x - ray spectroscopy and that expected on the basis of reddening e(b - v ) due to the dust suggests the likely possibility that the same material is responsible for the obscuration both in optical and x - rays .",

    "the interstellar medium of the host galaxy with a dust : gas ratio being comparable with galactic dust might represent a good candidate for this obscuration @xcite . in particular , @xcite proposed that obscuration possibly occurs in the ism of a host galaxy inclined to our line of sight ( los ) , although obscuration by circumnuclear dust is also important .",
    "as described in sect . [ complex ] , our spectral analysis results are also consistent with a scenario wherein the absorber only partially covers the x - ray emitting region .",
    "this implies two distinct los and that the obscuring screen along our los is not uniform , being spatially located in the nuclear region .",
    "the obscuring material must indeed be close to the continuum source for partial covering to work .",
    "a clumpy ( sub-)pc - scale _ torus _ as that proposed by @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) can easily satisfy both these conditions .",
