    "the second peak lies at 2.5 mev when @xmath140 but shifts down to 2.3 mev when @xmath43 .",
    "more problematically , the predicted spectrum contains three peaks between 2 and 4 mev ( although the third peak is suppressed with @xmath102 ) whereas the measured spectrum contains only two . for @xmath186 mev and @xmath43 , there are no predicted sw excitations between 4 and 5 mev at @xmath252 or @xmath85 .",
    "consequently , the observed peak at 4.4 mev is missing from our spectrum , which falls off much more rapidly than the measured @xmath247 above 4 mev .",
    "keep in mind , however , that the predicted shape of @xmath247 sensitively depends on the resolution function used to perform the averaging .",
    "a primary motivation of this work was to see how well a microscopic model can describe the properties of one of the simplest and most technologically important multiferroic materials .",
    "we have demonstrated that all four modes observed by thz and raman spectroscopies in are predicted by a model that includes two dm interactions , one along @xmath30 responsible for the cycloid periodicity and the other along @xmath31 responsible for its tilt of the cycloid out of the @xmath181 plane . using reasonable values for the easy - axis anisotropy and the dm interactions , we obtain excellent agreement with the measured mode frequencies .",
    "the parameters @xmath253 mev , @xmath254 mev , and @xmath186 mev provide very good descriptions of both the spectroscopic and inelastic neutron - scattering measurements , thereby resolving an earlier disagreement @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic modes evolve with the complexity of the cycloid . with a single dm interaction @xmath27 , the cycloid is coplanar and purely harmonic . for nonzero frequencies ,",
    "the only spectroscopically - active mode is @xmath8 ( @xmath183 , @xmath255 ) , which coincides with the em ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "easy - axis anisotropy @xmath5 along @xmath31 distorts the coplanar cycloid and introduces higher even harmonics in the hamiltonian @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath257 potential splits @xmath189 into @xmath137 ( @xmath183 , @xmath256 ) and @xmath138 ( @xmath184 ) ; the @xmath192 potential splits @xmath159 into @xmath136 and @xmath258 .",
    "hybridized with @xmath133 by the @xmath257 potential , @xmath136 ( @xmath178 ) becomes spectroscopically active .",
    "finally , the dm interaction @xmath57 tilts the non - coplanar cycloid out of the @xmath181 plane .",
    "then , @xmath11 ( @xmath183 ) and @xmath135 ( @xmath178 ) are dynamically and spectroscopically activated by their hybridization with @xmath158 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "thus , additional interactions modify the mode spectrum as more modes hybridize with @xmath133 and @xmath158 .",
    "several experiments indicate that the low - temperature , low - field cycloid of undergoes a transition at about 140 k or 10 t. in thz measurements @xcite , the low - frequency @xmath11/@xmath135 mode disappears above 120 k and the high - frequency @xmath136 mode disappears above 150 k. nevertheless , the selection rules governing the @xmath158 modes do not change @xcite . in raman measurements ,",
    "all modes persist for all temperatures but their frequencies @xcite and intensities @xcite display kinks at about 140 k. optical @xcite and electron - spin resonance @xcite measurements show anomalies at about 10 t with indications that the cycloidal phase above 10 t is the same as the one above 140 k. recently , nagel _ et al . _",
    "[ ] found that the thz modes exhibit kinks at about 5.5 t. but the nature of these transitions and the difference between the two cycloidal phases remain unknown .    with magnetic field along @xmath31 , the hamiltonian of eq.([ham ] )",
    "does not produce a transition between different cycloidal phases @xcite .",
    "therefore , the proposed model may be incomplete . since @xmath10 is responsible for the low - frequency @xmath11/@xmath135 mode , a sudden change in @xmath10 at 140 k or 10 t would produce anomalies in its spectroscopic features . a jump in @xmath10 at 140 k",
    "would also produce a jump in the weak ferromagnetic moment @xmath259 .",
