    "since einstein s general relativity was set forth in the last century , it has been of interest in the study of possible modifications of his theory .",
    "one of the most promising extension of general relativity is chern - simons modified gravity @xcite , in which the einstein - hilbert action is modified by adding a parity - violating chern - simons term , which couples to gravity via a scalar field .",
    "the parity - violating chern - simons term is a combination of the second order in the curvature tensor and a chern - simons scalar field .",
    "thus , the chern - simons modified gravity is a high - energy extension of einstein s general relativity .",
    "actually , chern - simons correction is necessary in the string theory as an anomaly - canceling term to conserve unitarity @xcite . in loop quantum gravity",
    ", it is required to ensure gauge invariance of the ashtekar variables @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the chern - simons modified gravity could help us to explain several problems in cosmology , such as , dark energy and dark matter @xcite , baryon asymmetry @xcite , and so on .",
    "it is well know that there exist two formulations of chern - simons modified gravity . in the non - dynamical formulation ,",
    "the chern - simons scalar field is an _ a priori _ prescribed function so that its effective evolution equation can be reduced to a differential constraint on the space of allowed solutions @xcite .",
    "while in the dynamical formulation , the chern - simons scalar field is treated as a dynamical field possessing its own stress - energy tensor and an evolution equation @xcite . it must be pointed that although the non - dynamical chern - simons gravity action can be obtained as a certain limit of the dynamical chern - simons gravity action , the non - dynamical chern - simons gravity and dynamical chern - simons gravity are inequivalent and independent theories . in general , the solutions of the non - dynamical chern - simons gravity can not be obtained from the solutions of the dynamical chern - simons gravity @xcite .",
    "the characteristic observational signature of the chern - simons modified gravity could allow us to discriminate an effect of this theory from other phenomena . since the schwarzschild solution is unaffected by chern - simons modified gravity ,",
    "the solar system tests of general relativity do not put strict bounds on the magnitude of this correction .",
    "recently , cardoso _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of the dynamical chern - simons perturbations in the background of a schwarzschild black hole and found that the quasinormal modes could offer a way to detect the correction from dynamical chern - simons terms . for a rotating black hole",

    "alexander and yunes @xcite adopted to a far - field approximation and obtained a rotating black hole solution in the chern - simons modified gravity . in the non - dynamical framework , it was found that the chern - simons modified theory predicts an anomalous precession effect @xcite , which was tested with lageos @xcite . using double binary pulsar data , yunes and",
    "spergel @xcite obtained a bound on the non - dynamical model with a canonical chern - simons scalar field . in the dynamical chern - simons modified gravity , yunes and pretorius @xcite found a rotating black hole solution by using of the small - coupling and slow - rotation limit .",
    "this rotating black hole solution was also obtained by konno _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "harko @xcite studied the properties of the thin accretion disk around this black hole and probed the effect of the chern - simons coupling parameter on the flux and the emission spectrum of the accretion disks .",
    "@xcite studied the null geodesics corresponding to a slowly - rotating black hole in the dynamical chern - simons gravity and discussed the effect of the chern - simons term on the shadows casted by a black hole .",
    "these results are very useful for us to understand the properties of black holes in the chern - simons modified gravity .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study geodetic precession and the strong gravitational lensing in the slowly - rotating black hole in the dynamical chern - simons modified gravity theory and to see what effects of the chern - simons coupling parameter on the geodetic precession angle for the timelike particles and the coefficients of gravitational lensing in the strong field limit .",
    "the plan of our paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce briefly the dynamical formulation of the chern - simons modified gravity and present the a slowly - rotating black hole solution found in @xcite . in sec.iii , we calculate the effects of the chern - simons term on the geodetic precession in the circular orbits around this black hole . in sec.iv , we adopt to bozza s method @xcite and obtain the deflection angles for light rays passing close to the slowly - rotating black hole in the dynamical chern - simons modified gravity , and then probe the effects of the chern - simons coupling parameter on the deflection angle and on the coefficients in the strong field limit . at last ,",

    "we limit ourselves to the case where @xmath25 and study the effect of @xmath2 on the geodetic precession and the strong gravitational lensing in the background ( [ metric0 ] ) .",
