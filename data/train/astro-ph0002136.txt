    "recent infrared and sub - mm surveys revealed a very steep slope of galaxy number count compared with that expected from no evolution model , and provided a new impetus to the related field .",
    "such excess of galaxy number count is generally understood as a consequence of strong galaxy evolution , i.e. rapid change of the star formation rate in galaxies .",
    "now japanese infrared satellite project astro - f ( _ infrared imaging surveyor _ : _ iris _ ) is in progress , and we calculated the expected number count by a simple empirical method ( takeuchi et al .",
    "1999 ; hirashita et al .",
    "the applied model was based on the _ iras _ surveys , and we need more realistic one to study the detailed observational plans and follow - up strategies . in order to construct the advanced model , we first compiled the infrared / sub - mm seds of galaxies obtained by _ iso _ , scuba , and other facilities , and derived average seds for various classes of galaxies .",
    "then , using the local luminosity function , we studied the required galaxy evolutionary history statistically .",
    "we construct the seds of galaxies based on the _ iras _  color  luminosity relation ( smith et al .",
    "1987 ; soifer & neugebauer 1991 ) .",
    "for the infrared  sub - mm component , we consider pah ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ) , graphite and silicate dust spectra ( dwek et al . 1996 ) .",
    "detailed pah band emission parameters are taken from allamandola et al .",
    "for the longer wavelength regime , power - law continuum produced by synchrotron radiation ( @xmath3 ) dominates .",
    "we set @xmath4 according to condon ( 1992 ) .",
    "the seds are presented in fig . 1 .",
    "we applied the double power - law form ( soifer et al .",
    "1987 ) for the local luminosity function , and assumed pure luminosity evolution in this study .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "2 . the faint - end slope does not affect the result , because the number count is an integrated value along with redshift and volume , and its contribution is small .",
    "we treat the evolutionary change of galaxy luminosities as a stepwise nonparametric form , in order to explore the most suitable evolutionary history which reproduces the present observational results .",
    "furthermore the constraint from cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) should be considered as another observational constraint to the models of evolutionary history .",
    "first , we searched the evolutionary pattern which satisfy the constraint required from cirb and we found three patterns ( evolution @xmath5 ) shown in fig .",
    "these three evolutionary patterns satisfy the constraint from cirb ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in order to satisfy the high background intensity at @xmath6 m ,",
    "the high evolutionary factor at @xmath7 is a mandatory .",
    "we note that too large evolutionary factor at high @xmath8 would produce the excess around @xmath9 m .",
    "we obtain ir @xmath1 m luminosity density along with redshift ( fig .",
    "5 ) from fig .",
    "figure 5 show the rapid evolution in @xmath10 .",
    "the increase is well described by @xmath11  ! we need such a sudden rise of @xmath10 to reproduce the very high cirb intensity at @xmath6 m mentioned before .",
    "the peak of the ir luminosity density is located at @xmath12 .",
    "recently , new observational results of the galaxy number counts at the mid - infrared and far - infrared ( mainly by _ iso _ ) , and submillimeter ( scuba and others ) .",
    "we are able to compile these data as well as previously obtained _ iras _ data and radio data .",
    "it is obviously important to calculate multiband number count predictions and compare the multiband observations , because the response of the results to the galaxy evolutionary form varies with different wavelengths . in principle",
    ", the galaxy number count is an integrated value along with redshift @xmath8 , and the information of the redshift is not available .",
    "but the redshift degeneracy can be solved to some extent , by treating the multiband observational results at the same time .",
    "we check whether the three evolutionary patterns found in the previous section also satisfy the constraints from observations of number counts .",
    "we compare our number counts with observations in fig .",
    "6 ( infrared ) , and fig . 7 ( sub - mm  radio ) .",
    "every pattern satisfys the constraints .",
    "when we especially focus on the sub - mm number counts , the evolution 3 is the most desirable .",
    "infrared imaging surveyor ( _ iris _ ) is a satellite which will be launched in 2003 , by the m - v rocket of the _ isas _ ( the institute of space and astronautical science in japan ) .",
    "one of the main purposes of the _ iris _ mission is an all - sky survey at far - infrared ( fir ) with a flux limit much deeper than that of _ iras_. detailed information of _ iris _ is available at http://koala.astro.isas.ac.jp/astro-f/index-e.html .    in order to examine the performance of the survey , we estimated the fir galaxy counts in two narrow bands ( i.e. n60 and n170 ) based on models described in the previous section .",
    "we found that a large number of galaxies ( @xmath2 in the whole sky ) will be detected in this survey ( fig . 8) .",
    "we wish to thank dr .",
    "hiroshi shibai , dr .",
    "izumi murakami and dr .",
    "hideo matsuhara for helpful discussions .",
    "kimiaki kawara also deserves our thanks for providing us their number count in the lockman hole for reference .",
