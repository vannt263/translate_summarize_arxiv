    "the hod model tells us how galaxies are connected to dark matter halos _",
    "statistically_. a natural extension is then to consider how well we can connect galaxies to dark matter halos for _ individual _ galaxies .",
    "naively we can infer the host halo property of individual galaxies by examining number densities of galaxies around the target galaxies , since a higher number density suggests that the target galaxy is more likely to reside in a group- or cluster - scale dark matter halo .",
    "however it is also possible that the galaxy actually resides in a low - mass halo which appears to be associated with a massive halo because of chance projection along the line - of - sight .",
    "the redshift information is usually not sufficient to remove the chance projection , particularly because the observed spatial distributions of galaxies in massive halos are significantly elongated in the redshift direction due to peculiar motions of the galaxies ( the so - called fingers of god effect ) .    in this paper , we develop a theoretical framework to compute the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of host halo masses of individual galaxies given number counts of nearby galaxies , assuming that the true hod is known a priori .",
    "we employ the hod formalism to predict , for each galaxy , the expected number of neighboring galaxies within a cylinder of redshift interval @xmath2 and transverse comoving distance within @xmath3 .",
    "we include contributions from both galaxies within the same host halo and those residing in different halos .",

    "finally we combine these two pdfs to obtain the pdf of total neighboring galaxy counts @xmath95",
    "we now turn the problem around and ask how well we can infer the host halo mass of a single target galaxy from observed neighboring galaxy counts .",
    "this is obtained by using the bayes theorem @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath75 are given in equations  ( [ eq : pofnp ] ) and ( [ eq : pm ] ) , respectively .",
    "we use the all - sky light - cone mock catalog from @xcite to test our analytic predictions .",
    "this mock is based on the semi - analytic model of @xcite , and is constructed by replicating the millennium run simulation box ( @xmath98mpc on a side ) without transformations such as rotation , translation , or inversion .",
    "@xcite showed that their model can reproduce important statistical properties of nearby galaxies such as the stellar mass function and two - point correlation function .    for each galaxy in the mock , information such as the sky position , redshift , apparent and absolute magnitudes",
    ", host dark matter halo mass , and central / satellite designation , is available .",
    "the catalog is flux limited to @xmath99 . in this paper",
    ", we generate a volume - limited galaxy subsample of @xmath100 to about @xmath101 and use the subsample for our analysis .",

    "we fit the halo occupation number obtained directly from the mock catalog to the parametrized form in equations  ( [ eq : hod_cen ] ) and ( [ eq : hod_sat ] ) , which contains five free parameters in total .",
    "we show the fitting result in figure  [ fig : hod ] , and summarize best - fit parameters in table  [ tab : hod ] .",
    "we find that the hod model adopted in this paper reproduces the mean occupation number in the mock galaxy catalog very well .      before comparing the pdf of the halo mass",
    ", we first check whether our analytic model reproduces neighboring galaxy counts in the mock galaxy catalog .",
    "the average ( projected ) neighboring galaxy counts around a galaxy inside a halo with mass @xmath11 is given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are given in equations  ( [ eq : ngc_ave_1h ] ) and ( [ eq : ngc_ave_2h ] ) , respectively .",
    "we compute neighboring galaxy counts as a function of the maximum comoving transverse distance @xmath3 .",
    "the redshift of target galaxies for which neighboring galaxy counts are considered is arbitrarily fixed at @xmath111 . in the mock galaxy catalog",
    ", we actually use galaxies in the small redshift range of @xmath112 . throughout the paper we consider the redshift range of neighboring galaxies of @xmath113 , which is sufficiently large to include the correlated structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : nc ] ( upper panel ) compares the average neighboring galaxy counts from the mock galaxy catalog with the analytic calculation ( equation  [ eq : ngc_ave ] ) .",
    "we consider target galaxies living in halos of three masses , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , and find that our model agrees well with the mock result , both at small and large @xmath3 where 1-halo and 2-halo contributions are dominated , respectively .",
    "as expected , neighboring galaxy counts are higher for galaxies in more massive host halos .",
    "we also check the variance of the average neighboring galaxy counts , @xmath117 .",
    "again , the variance is given by the sum of 1-halo and 2-halo contributions @xmath118 where @xmath119 is derived in equation  ( [ eq : ngc_var_2h ] ) .",
    "given the pdf of 1-halo neighboring galaxy counts ( equation  [ eq : pdf_ngc_1h ] ) , we can compute @xmath120 as @xmath121 the comparison shown in figure  [ fig : nc ] ( lower panel ) indicates that the analytic model reproduces the variance as well , in both 1-halo and 2-halo regimes .",
    "however there is relatively large deviation of the analytic model at @xmath122 for the host halo mass of @xmath123 .",
    "this might be explained by the non - gaussian error of the 2-halo term at very small scale .",
    "another possible explanation of the discrepancy is the presence of satellite galaxies outside @xmath41 ; we find that the mock galaxy catalog contains satellite galaxies that are located outside @xmath41 ( @xmath124  % ) , whereas we have assumed that all satellite galaxies are located within @xmath41 .",
    "we now compare our model of pdfs of the host halo masses given neighboring galaxy counts , @xmath125 ( equation  [ eq : pofm ] ) , with those obtained directly from the mock galaxy catalog .",
    "figure  [ fig : pofm ] compares the pdfs from the mock galaxy catalog with our analytic model .",
    "we find that our analytic models are in reasonably good agreement with the simulation result .",
    "in particular the analytic model nicely captures the complex behaviors of the pdfs .",
    "we find the pdf exhibits two peaks when the number of neighboring galaxies @xmath126 is large .",
    "the higher mass peak corresponds to the case that the galaxy resides in massive halos with about the peak mass . on the other hand , the lower mass peak is due to the chance projection , i.e. , the low - mass host halo of the galaxy is superposed on a massive halo or a dense structure on the sky , which boosts the neighboring galaxy counts .",
    "our analytic model reproduces this behavior .",
    "we find that the dependence of the pdfs on neighboring galaxy counts is weak for the large cylinder radius of @xmath127 for which the contribution is dominated by the 2-halo term .",
    "although neighboring galaxy counts depend on the host halo mass due to the halo mass dependence of the halo bias , neighboring galaxy counts also involves the large scatter originating from clustering of neighboring galaxies ( see figure  [ fig : nc ] ) .",
    "thus , in order to infer the host halo mass of individual galaxies , small cylinder radii of @xmath128 should be used for neighboring galaxy counts .    with the analytic model of pdfs of the host halo masses",
    ", we can easily explore how different choices of neighboring counts provide tighter constraints on halo masses .",
    "in addition to @xmath3 discussed above , we can also adjust the redshift range @xmath129 . here",
    "we demonstrate how we can optimize @xmath3 and @xmath129 from the pdfs . as a specific example",
    ", we consider an input halo mass of @xmath123 .",
    "we first compute the average neighboring number @xmath130 ( equation  [ eq : ngc_ave ] ) for given values of @xmath3 and @xmath129 , and compute the conditional pdf @xmath125 ( equation  [ eq : pofm ] ) given the number count @xmath131 equal to the average neighboring number .",
    "we quantify the tightness of the halo mass inference by computing the variance of the halo mass @xmath132 , @xmath133 , using the computed pdf .",
    "smaller @xmath133 indicates a narrower peak of the pdf and therefore tighter constraints on the halo mass .",
    "the contours shown in figure  [ fig : wpm ] confirm that cylinder radii of @xmath134 provide tightest constraints on the halo masses .",
    "we find that the dependence on @xmath129 is not very strong , but smaller @xmath129 generally produces tighter constraints , because of the smaller number of projected galaxies .",
    "we note that the best choice of the parameters depends also on other factors such as halo masses and underlying hod models .",
    "in section  [ sec : mock ] we have used a mock galaxy catalog to demonstrate that our analytic model can robustly predict the pdf of halo mass for a _ single _ galaxy , given its neighboring counts .",
    "although the example we have considered is somewhat idealized ( i.e. , with 100% spectroscopic sampling and redshift success rate ) , we note that these conditions are not required . in principle , for a given galaxy sample , as long as we can accurately model its hod , our model can be used to predict the host halo mass pdf for the galaxies _ in _ the sample .    here",
    "we briefly discuss various ways to extend the scope and capabilities of our model , including the possibility to distinguish central galaxies from satellites , the situation when the target and neighboring galaxies are from two different galaxy samples , the potential of improving the pdf with neighboring counts within multiple apertures , constraints on the hod itself , the application to galaxy samples selected with photometric redshifts , and the prospect of applying the same principle to inferring masses of galaxy clusters .      in many of hod studies ,",
    "central and satellite components are treated separately .",
    "therefore it is of great interest to know whether each galaxy corresponds to the central or satellite type .",
    "this can be obtained easily in this theoretical framework . from equation  ( [ eq : pdf_ngc_1h ] ) , we derive the joint probability of being a central galaxy and having a 1-halo neighboring galaxy count of @xmath135 as @xmath136 by replacing @xmath137 in equation  ( [ eq : pofnp ] ) with @xmath138 and inserting the result to equation  ( [ eq : pofm ] ) , we obtain the joint pdf of @xmath139 . the probability of being central given the host halo mass @xmath11 and neighboring galaxy count @xmath126 is then obtained as @xmath140    figure  [ fig : cent ] shows some examples of @xmath141 for the cylinder of radius @xmath142 .",
    "the probability is generally higher for smaller halo masses , simply because there are fewer satellite galaxies in lower mass halos ( see figure  [ fig : hod ] ) . on the other hand , the probabilities shown in figure  [ fig : cent ] exhibit dependences on neighboring galaxy counts @xmath126 , suggesting that neighboring galaxy counts do provide information when determining whether a galaxy is central or not .      while we have assumed that the target galaxy for which we infer the host halo mass and neighboring galaxies are the same population and they share the same hod , in principle we can use populations with different hods for neighboring galaxy counts ( e.g. , red and blue galaxies , galaxies of different luminosity / stellar mass , or groups / clusters instead of galaxies ) .",
    "the extension of our theoretical framework to this situation is straightforward .",
    "suppose the halo occupation number of the target galaxy @xmath143 differs from that of neighboring galaxies @xmath144 , the 1-halo neighboring galaxy counts are modified as @xmath145 @xmath146j_0(kr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath147 @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are spatial distributions of satellite components of target and neighboring galaxies , respectively , and the pdf of the host halo mass becomes @xmath151 and the average bias for the 2-halo calculation becomes @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are average number densities ( see equation  [ eq : n3dave ] ) of target and neighboring galaxies , respectively . also note that @xmath52 in @xmath155 should be interpreted as @xmath154 . since different galaxy populations probe different halo masses , the use of different galaxy populations for neighboring galaxy counts can help improve the inference of the host halo mass .",
    "the inference of the host halo mass may be improved further by considering multiple apertures , i.e. , combining neighboring galaxy counts with different cylinder radii . in this case , we need to take account of the covariance of neighboring galaxy counts carefully .",
    "we leave the exploration of this possibility for future work .",
    "there is also room for the improvement of our analytic model .",
    "for instance , attempts to improve the halo model have been made by including the halo exclusion effect and non - linearity of the 2-halo power spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the evaluation of non - gaussian error may be necessary to improve the estimate of the variance of 2-halo neighboring galaxy counts , @xmath92 ( see figure  [ fig : nc ] ) .",
    "we have also ignored the complexity of the halo properties , such as the scatter in the concentration parameter and the halo triaxiality .",
    "the hod model itself is also subject to possible improvements , e.g. , by including assembly bias @xcite and relative velocities of central galaxies @xcite .",
    "neighboring galaxy counts depend on the underlying hod model , and therefore in principle they can be used to constrain the hod itself . for this application ,",
    "it is crucial to estimate and remove the chance projection .",
    "one can infer the effect of pure chance projection by estimating the average number density , but the 2-halo contribution is not homogeneous but clustered around the target galaxy .",
    "the theoretical framework developed in this paper may be used to estimate the 2-halo contribution and its variance to derive more rigorous constraints on hod with counts - in - cylinders .",
    "although our formalism is readily applicable to several spectroscopic surveys such as sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , prism multi - object survey ( primus ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and eventually dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and subaru prime focus spectrograph ( pfs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is highly desirable to extend our model to incorporate samples selected with photometric redshifts , so that we could fully exploit the potential offered by large imaging surveys such as subaru hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey , dark energy survey , and large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; * ? ? ?",
    "we plan to address this extension in a future paper .",
    "galaxy clusters have long been regarded as a powerful cosmological probe , as their abundance is sensitively dependent on parameters such as @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "accurate knowledge of cluster mass is required , however , before any useful cosmological constraints can be deduced @xcite .",
    "our formalism could be straightforwardly applied to galaxy clusters , especially samples detected in optical / near - ir imaging surveys , for which it has typically been difficult to deduce mass reliably for individual clusters . with the knowledge of pdf of cluster mass",
    ", it should be possible to obtain tighter constraints from cluster abundance .",
    "in the highly successful hod framework , the dark matter halo mass is the sole factor controlling the galaxy formation process .",
    "it is thus critically important to be able to estimate the halo mass of galaxies .",
    "traditionally , this is achieved by techniques such as strong gravitational lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxy - galaxy lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , satellite kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and large scale clustering ( e.g , . * ? ? ?",
    "except for the first method , all the others work in a statistical sense , that is , they can not be applied to a single galaxy .",
    "an alternative method is developed by @xcite , where the concept of abundance matching is employed to a large group catalog which includes groups with only one member . under the assumption of one - to - one correspondence between halo mass and stellar mass / luminosity content of the group members ,",
    "a halo mass is _ assigned _ to each of the groups .",
    "however , with this approach , little or no information on the pdf of the halo mass is provided .",
    "furthermore , given the difficulties in constructing group group catalogs at low mass halo regime and the associated uncertainties , the one - to - one correspondence between these groups and dark halos is likely to break down , rendering halo mass assignment unreliable .    we have developed a theoretical framework to compute the pdf of the host halo mass for a single galaxy , given its neighboring galaxy counts .",
    "we have derived explicit expression for the number of neighboring galaxies within the cylinder of redshift interval @xmath23 and transverse comoving distance @xmath158 in terms of the hod model .",
    "we include both 1-halo contribution from the same host halo and 2-halo contribution including chance projection for the neighboring galaxy counts .",
    "we have used the result to obtain the conditional pdf of the host halo mass given neighboring galaxy counts .",
    "we compare our analytic model with results from the mock galaxy catalog , finding reasonable agreements .",
    "the pdf of the host halo mass exhibits complex behavior , with generally two peaks at low- and high - mass regimes for the case of large neighboring galaxy counts .",
