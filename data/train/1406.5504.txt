    "heterodyne - detected optical kerr effect ( hd - oke ) has been widely used since more than twenty years for the investigation of dynamical properties of molecular liquids .",
    "not surprising , a remarkable fraction of this work has been dedicated to the study of liquid water , often in relation to the hypothesized presence of two liquid phases .",
    "we recently published new hd - oke experimental results covering a very broad temperature range , extended into the supercooled regime , characterized by very high accuracy and unprecedented signal - to - noise ratio @xcite . here",
    "we intend to report on the detailed analysis of those data , comparing the results of different theoretical models .",
    "our intention is not to formulate a ranking of those models on the basis of their ability of reproducing the experimental data , but rather to highlight the pros and cons of the different approaches and , most of all , to point out the key features of each model responsible for its predictive capabilities . in the following , we first recall the main aspects of hd - oke measurements of liquid and supercooled water , and of the recovery of the sample response function , both in time and frequency domains .",
    "we dedicate special attention to the deconvolution of the femtosecond oke data , and demonstrate the crucial importance of an accurate measurement of the instrumental function . in the second part",
    ", we present the detailed analysis of those data making use of three different theoretical models .",
    "we conclude by summarizing the main findings and pointing out the most relevant features of the models .",
    "in a hd - oke experiment  @xcite a linearly polarized laser pulse induces transient birefringence in a medium by means of a non resonant non - linear effect .",
    "the induced birefringence can be probed by a second pulse of different polarization , spatially superimposed to the pump within the sample .",
    "the change of the polarization status of the probe pulse , measured as a function of the delay time from the pump , gives information about the non - linear response of the studied material .",
    "the signal is characterized by an instantaneous electronic contribution plus a decaying contribution , which constitutes the most interesting part , as it contains information about the relaxation and vibrational response of the molecules in the sample .",
    "the time window probed in an oke experiment can be very broad , extending from tens of femtoseconds to hundreds of picoseconds .",
    "this makes oke a very powerful technique , capable of revealing very different dynamic regimes in a variety of samples , from simple liquids to supercooled liquids and glass formers  @xcite , it makes possible measuring , at the same time , the slow relaxation processes and the fast inter molecular vibrations of the system . in the optical heterodyne detection configuration ,",
    "the signal is directly proportional to the third order non - linear response function of the material , @xmath0 , convoluted with the instrumental function , @xmath1 .",
    "liquid water is a challenging sample for this kind of experiment because of its very weak oke response , due to its nearly isotropic molecular polarizability .",
    "for this reason , we implemented in our set - up , based on a ti : sapphire laser oscillator ( wavelength 800 nm , pulse width 18 fs ) , two experimental improvements that enabled us to measure the fast vibrational dynamics and the slow structural relaxation in the same experiment , with very high signal - to - noise ratio and large dynamic range .",
    "the first feature is the independent and continuous motion of a translation stage , equipped with a linear encoder , which ensures the absolute control of the position  @xcite .",
    "this reduces substantially the acquisition time and improves the signal statistics .",
    "the second one is the implementation of a peculiar configuration of the heterodyne detection  @xcite , which makes use of a circularly polarized probe beam and of a differential detection of two opposite - phase signals on a balanced photodiode . as shown in fig.[setup ] , a quarter wave - plate between the two polarisers produces the circularly polarized probe field .",
    "two signals , with opposite polarizations and with opposite phase respect to the local field , emerge from the p2 polarizer , and are sent to the balanced photodiode detector .",
    "the oke signal measured in such a way is automatically heterodyned and free from any spurious phase - independent signal .",
    "a further improvement is obtained by subtracting the two hd - oke measurements obtained with left and right circular polarizations of the probe field .",
    "this procedure removes from the signal the dichroic contributions coming from possible misalignment of the wave - plate .",
    "the output signal of the photodiode is amplified by a lock - in amplifier and digitalized by an acquisition board .",
    "a home made software acquires the processed signal together with the reading of the delay line encoder and retraces the final time dependent hd - oke signal .",
    "supercooling bulk water is not an easy task because water is prone to crystallization ; special care in the preparation and manipulation of the samples is required in order to reach very low temperatures .",
    "we performed our measurements on a sealed vial of cylindrical shape , prepared for pharmaceutical purposes by the angelini company : the lowest temperature reached for this sample was 247 k. the vial was inserted into a parallelepiped - shaped aluminum holder , whose central cylindrical cavity fits the diameter of the vial . a thin film of glycerol between the vial and the housing assured an efficient heat transfer .",
    "the holder was fixed to the cold plate of a peltier cooler , whose temperature was controlled , with a stability of 0.1 k , by a platinum thermoresistance in thermal contact with the holder itself .",
    "two fused silica windows inserted on two opposite sides of the aluminum holder allowed the beams to cross the sample .",
    "the signal measured in an heterodyne - detected optical kerr effect ( hd - oke ) experiment is @xcite @xmath2 with @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the probing and exciting laser intensities , respectively ; @xmath1 is their intensity correlation , determining the experimental time resolution and has thus the role of instrumental function , and @xmath0 is the material response .",
    "since we are performing a non - resonant oke experiment , the born - oppenheimer approximation applies and the response function can be cast in the form  @xcite : @xmath6 with @xmath7 representing the instantaneous electronic response and @xmath8 the nuclear response .",
    "the latter can be written in the classical limit as @xmath9 in eq .",
    "[ response ] @xmath10 is the heaviside step function , @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath12 the time correlation function of the anisotropic susceptibility @xmath13 @xmath14 beaing the off - diagonal element of the susceptibility tensor ( i.e. the collective electronic polarizability ) .    in order to fit the oke data we simulated the measured signal using the following expression : @xmath15   g(t ' ) dt ' \\label{signalfit}\\ ] ] taking the fourier transform of eq .",
    "[ signalfit ] , we get @xmath16 \\widetilde{g}(\\omega ) \\label{signalfitft}\\ ] ] as , for the non resonant oke , @xmath7 is real , we get from [ signalfitft ] the important result that the imaginary part of @xmath17 is unaffected by the instantaneous response , and that for nuclear part @xmath18 = im\\left [ \\frac{\\widetilde{s}(\\omega)}{\\widetilde{g}(\\omega)}\\right ] \\label{imromega}\\ ] ] hallowing the extraction of @xmath19 from the oke signal once the instrumental function is known .",
    "an important experimental issue concerns the measurement of the actual instrumental function @xmath1 , which is far from trivial .",
    "eq.[signalfit ] shows clearly that the instrumental function can be measured directly if the sample has negligible or very fast nuclear response ( i.e. if @xmath20 ) .    in many cases ,",
    "a fused silica plate has been used to this purpose , because of its weak and fast nuclear response .",
    "actually , the oke response of silica is quite complex and difficult to determine , so it turns out to be not particularly adapt when a precise determination of real @xmath1 is required .",
    "some previous studies utilized the second harmonic cross - correlation of the pump and probe pulses to measure the instrumental function , see kinoshita et al .",
    "we found that any small modification and adjustment of the experimental set - up , inevitable when replacing the water sample with the reference material chosen for measuring @xmath1 , causes severe alterations of the latter .",
    "for instance , i ) the insertion of a second harmonic crystal in place of the sample modifies the pulse compression status , ii ) the spatial overlap the beams requires some re - alignment , iii ) the translation stage has to be re - positioned in order to achieve the temporal superposition of pump and probe pulses .",
    "actually , even small changes of the experimental conditions critically affect the instrumental function . with an alternative procedure , in some other cases the instrumental function was obtained by fitting the instantaneous electronic contribution to the hd - oke signal with an analytic peak function ( gaussian , hyperbolic secant , etc .. ) .",
    "the oke experiments in water are typically characterized by very low and fast signals , so that the precise determination of the instrumental function is extremely important in order to extract the water response .",
    "the experimental methods , summarized above , are not enough accurate for this purpose .",
    "we measured the instrumental function following a different procedure that grants the proper level of accuracy required for water investigations .",
    "as reference sample we chose a plate of calcium fluoride ( caf@xmath21 ) ; this is a cubic ionic crystal with only one raman active band in the probed frequency range , the optical phonon at 322  @xmath22 of t@xmath23 symmetry .",
    "its nuclear oke response is then simple and well known .",
    "the calcium fluoride plate was dipped inside a water vial , identical to that used for water measurements , supported by the same sample holder .",
    "the measurement of the instrumental function was done by just replacing the water vial with the water - caf@xmath21 vial , leaving the rest of the set - up unchanged .",
    "we took care that the faces of the caf@xmath21 plate were perpendicular to the line bisecting the angle formed by pump and probe beams .",
    "the thickness of the caf@xmath21 plate , 3 mm , was enough to fully contain the probe and pump overlap area , avoiding any spurious signal contribution by the outer water .",
    "we took a reference measurement for each set of water data .",
    "this procedure , differently from the other approaches , allows us to accurately preserve the experimental conditions adopted in the water and in the reference measurements .",
    "( circles ) and the instrumental function ( red continuous line ) obtained with the fitting procedure described in the text . the nuclear response , @xmath24 , is taken as the time - derivative of a single damped oscillator and the instrumental function , @xmath25 , is simulated as the sum of gaussian , lorentzian , and hyperbolic secant functions .",
    "the comparison with the fit of the instantaneous electronic part performed using just a single hyperbolic secant ( blue dashed line ) is reported too . ]",
    "[ caf2 ] reports a typical hd - oke signal obtained in the caf@xmath21 reference sample : the signal shows a first peak , due to the electronic response , characterized by very fast rise and fall , and a second oscillating contribution due to the nuclear response .",
    "this signal is the convolution of the instrumental function with the oke response , see eq.[signalfit ] ; for caf@xmath21 its nuclear part is the time derivative of a single harmonic damped oscillator ( dho ) .",
    "the simplicity of this nuclear response function allows the reliable extraction of the instrumental function , @xmath1 , by means of an iterative fitting procedure ( i.e. least square fitting of the hd - oke data of the reference sample with the simulated signal according to eq.[signalfit ] ) .",
    "we found that our instrumental function can not be reproduced by a single hyperbolic secant function , as often reported in the literature ; a good fit requires the sum of several functions , namely a combination of gaussian , lorentzian and/or hyperbolic secant functions . in fig .",
    "[ caf2 ] we report the instrumental function obtained by the iterative fitting procedure ( red continuous line ) and the one obtained by fitting the electronic peak with a simple hyperbolic secant function ( blue dashed line ) .",
    "apparently these two instrumental functions are very similar but the small differences can not be neglected for an accurate investigation of water fast oke response .",
    "this is mostly evident when the data are fourier transformed to the frequency domain .    .",
    "we obtained the response function by deconvolution of the hd - oke signal @xmath26 according to eq .",

    "the figure compares the results obtained for the caf@xmath21 sample by adopting the iterative fitting procedure described in the text ( red line ) , and by fitting the electronic peak with a hyperbolic secant function ( blue line ) .",

    "[ caf2-freq ] shows the comparison between the frequency response calculated using the instrumental function obtained by the iterative fitting procedure ( red line ) and the one obtained by simply fitting the electronic peak with a hyperbolic secant function ( blue line ) .",
    "we clearly see that only an accurate measurement of the real time domain instrumental function yields the correct response . as a further test of the method , we measured the oke signal of a carbon tetrachloride ( ccl@xmath27 ) liquid sample .",
    "we inserted a scrap of caf@xmath21 slab in the ccl@xmath27 cell for measuring the instrumental function .",
    "the resulting ccl@xmath27 frequency response is shown in fig .",
    "[ ccl4-freq ] ( black open circle ) .",
    "the agreement of our data with the depolarized raman scattering spectrum ( red continuous line ) , corrected for the bose factor , is good in the entire spectral range ; frequencies and amplitudes of raman bands being very well reproduced .",
    "this confirms the high accuracy of the employed method .",
    "obtained from the oke data using the instrumental function extracted from a caf@xmath21 slab inserted in the ccl@xmath27 cell .",
    "our data ( black open circles ) reproduce very well the depolarized raman scattering spectrum ( red continuous line ) , both in frequency and amplitude , corrected for the bose factor . ]",
    "the role of the instrumental function in hd - oke experiments has been always considered as a underpinning problem for a correct data analysis , but to our knowledge it has never been addressed in such a quantitative way . in the present study , the unprecedented signal / noise ratio and the accurate determination of the instrumental function ensure a correct data analysis , from which a reliable oke response can be extracted , also in case of weak and fast decaying signals .          in fig .",
    "[ oke - data ] we report all the hd - oke data collected on water at changing of temperatures from liquid phase to the supercooled one .",
    "the left panel shows the short times in a log - linear plot and the right panel the data are reported in a log - log plot showing the whole time - scale measured .",
    "water shows a complex relaxation pattern strongly dependent by the temperature .",
    "decreasing temperature the fast oscillating dynamics becomes more structured and the slow relaxation decay becomes increasingly long .    at short times we have fast oscillations due to inter - molecular vibrational modes .",
    "these correspond to the two broad bands centered at about @xmath28 and @xmath29 , generally addressed in the literature  @xcite as  bending \" and  stretching \" modes of the hydrogen - bond network , respectively . at long times",
    "the signal shows a monotonic decay ; in the first oke investigations it was interpreted as a bi - exponential relaxation , due to single molecule orientational dynamics@xcite .",
    "further experiments , extending the temperature range to the supercooled phase , proved that the slow decay follows a stretched exponential function , typical of structural relaxation phenomena , with a critical slow down of the relaxation times@xcite .",
    "as we briefly summarized in section sec.[sec : okesignal ] , the time - resolved hd - oke experiment measures the time correlation function of the off - diagonal susceptibility elements .",
    "these are collective polarizability tensors of the liquid whose definition is quite complex .",
    "there have been many studies concerning the basic problem of defining the optical observables ( i.e. susceptibility tensor ) starting from the molecular features and dynamics , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the general theories that define rigorously this connection necessarily involve a huge number of physical variables and they turn out to be not operative for a comparison with the oke experimental data .",
    "so the oke response interpretation have been typically done using phenomenological models@xcite , and/or computer simulations@xcite .",
    "recently , mode - coupling theories , dynamic models at the mesoscopic scale , based on the memory function approach , have also been used to interpret the oke results  @xcite .",
    "the definition of the oke response function in liquid water is even more complex than in other liquids due the almost isotropic molecular polarizability and to the hydrogen - bounded network that make the oke observable dominated by the collective susceptibility and dynamics .",
    "numerical simulations of the oke signal in liquid water@xcite show a complex interplay between intrinsic molecular terms and interaction - induced contributions . two main issues need to be addressed in order to define the oke response .",
    "first , one has to pinpoint the physical parameters relevant for the experimentally probed dynamics and what are the equations of motion that they follow . in order to have an operative model ,",
    "both the liquid modes and their equations of motion must be relatively simple , in other words they should be defined with a coarse - graining approach , where the fine molecular features are averaged out .",
    "second , the connection between optical susceptibility and modes of the liquid must be defined .",
    "few phenomenological models have been utilized to analyse the whole time - dependent oke response in liquid water@xcite . as well as , the mode - coupling theory has been used to simulate the water response@xcite .    in the following sections we compare the results of three different theoretical models in the an analysis of our new oke data , extending into supercooled water phase ; namely , the multi - mode brownian oscillator ( mbo ) model@xcite , the kubo s discrete random jump model@xcite , and the schematic mode - coupling model  @xcite .",
    "the first two models have been already applied for the analysis of the oke data of water@xcite , but only in the stable liquid phase , the third one has been very recently applied with success to water in the liquid and supercooled phases by the same authors of the present paper  @xcite . including the hd - oke results for the supercooled phase of water provides a more stringent test also of the first two theories .      a relatively simple multi - mode brownian oscillator model ( mbo )",
    "was utilized by palese et al .",
    "@xcite to describe the liquid water dynamics .",
    "the model aims at describing the whole relaxation behaviour of the liquid without a time scale separation , a priori imposed , between the fast and slow dynamics .",
    "the susceptibility tensor is taken as a second order expansion on the nuclear @xmath30-modes@xcite , @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath30 variables must be interpreted as local normal modes of the liquid obtained from a coarse - graining treatment of the molecular and intermolecular coordinates .",
    "the equation of motion of these mbo modes are described by a damped harmonic oscillator ( dho ) equation , @xmath32 .",
    "the non - resonant nuclear third - order response function , in particular the oke response , from a single dho can be written as@xcite :    @xmath33 \\right\\ } \\label{respmbo}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 quadratic term in this equation expresses the non - linear coupling between the susceptibility and the @xmath30-mode , when @xmath38 the simple dho response function is recovered .",
    "the mbo model used by palese et al . considers a continuous ensemble of @xmath30-modes characterized by different frequencies @xmath39 ; these modes are uncoupled ( i.e. defined by independent dho equations ) and all characterized by identical damping coefficients , @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , some modes are under - dumped and other ones are over - damped , in dependence of their @xmath39 value .",
    "each @xmath30-mode has a homogeneous broadening , expressed by @xmath7 , which is assumed temperature dependent and related to the liquid viscosity .",
    "the collection of @xmath30-modes is shaped by an inhomogeneous broadening function , @xmath40 , which fixes the weigh of each mode in the distribution .",
    "the inhomogeneous broadening is due to the interactions of the @xmath30-mode with the thermal bath and it taken in the form@xcite : @xmath41 where the sum over @xmath42 accounts for different dynamics , like librations , translations and bendings , which contribute to the frequency distribution of the harmonic oscillators .",
    "the mbo model simulates the oke nuclear response function with the oscillator ensemble according to the following integral equation : @xmath43 the integration range in eq .",
    "[ respmbotot ] is lower limited by the cut - off frequency @xmath44 , corresponding to the physical restriction that no oscillator can have an oscillation period longer than the structural rearrangement of the bath .",
    "this cut - off is proportional to the homogeneous damping @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a temperature independent coefficient .    the cut - off frequency in the integration yields a signal that at long times relaxes as a single exponential with time constant @xmath47 .",
    "the mbo model can not account for the stretched exponential decay at very long times ; this is a first serious limit in order to fit the oke data in the supercooled phase .",
    "moreover , since the structural relaxation time , @xmath48 , is proportional to the viscosity , the homogeneous width @xmath7 is inversely proportional to the viscosity ; so the temperature dependence of @xmath7 is fixed by the viscosity . in summary , in the mbo model the slow relaxation dynamics is accounted for by the superposition of low - frequency over - damped oscillators in eq.[respmbotot ] , critically dependent on the @xmath44 cut - off frequency , while the fast vibrational part results from the inhomogeneous distribution of under - dumped oscillators .",
    "the integral equation ( 8) provides a smooth merging of the two oscillator ensembles .        in the liquid phase ,",
    "we confirm the results already reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model is able to reproducing the oke signal in the whole temporal range , with the proper temperature behaviour of all the fitting parameters , but fails more and more as temperature decreases , see fig .",
    "[ figmuka1 ] . in summary , it is not able to accurately reproducing the fast dynamics , responsible for the complex structure of the vibrational bands and the stretched exponential character of the slow relaxation .",
    "the fitting function is obtained by numerical convolution of the oke response function , see eqs .",
    "[ signalfit ] and eq .",
    "[ respmbotot ] , with the instrumental function obtained as explained in section  [ instrfunct ] .",
    "the best fit is achieved by the repeated variation , in a numerical loop , of the fitting parameters , until a nonlinear least - squares minimization is reached .",
    "the fitting function is built on an inhomogeneous broadening presenting two water bands : at @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which are usually assigned to stretching and bending of the hydrogen bond , respectively .",
    "palese et al .",
    "introduced other higher frequency bands in order to simulate their oke data ; according our analysis , frequencies higher then about @xmath51 are not necessary , once the instrumental response function is properly taken into account . in our mbo analysis , we used nine free fitting parameters : the parameters of the inhomogeneous distribution @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , the width of the homogeneous distribution @xmath7 , and the amplitudes @xmath58 and @xmath59 appearing in eq .",
    "[ respmbo ] .",
    "the cut - off frequency @xmath44 in eq . [ respmbotot ] turns to be a very critical parameter in the fit , so we performed several fitting runs with different values of this coefficient . if the value fo the @xmath46 parameter in [ omegac ] is locked in the range @xmath60 , the fits are apparently fine but the inhomogeneous distribution parameters turn out to be non physical at high temperatures .",
    "in particular , we observed a narrowing of the modes with rising temperature .",
    "in fact , a value of @xmath46 in such a low range yields a large homogeneous width , necessary to fit the long times part of he data , with a consequent narrowing of the inhomogeneous modes required for the fitting of the oscillating part . with larger values of @xmath46 ( @xmath61 ) , the model fails to fit the long part of the data at the lowest temperatures , the simulated decay going to zero too fast . with intermediate values of @xmath46 ( @xmath62 ) ,",
    "the fit fails both at short and long times ; moreover , also in this case the inhomogeneous distribution has an unphysical temperature dependence . finally , a fully free value of the @xmath46 free fitting parameter leads to an apparently better reproduction of the data in the whole temporal range .",
    "however , the temperature trend of the @xmath7 parameter is definitely unphysical : in fact , it remains constant at all temperatures , yielding a temperature independence of liquid viscosity .    in fig .",

    "winkler et al . proposed an intriguing interpretation of these resonances for liquid water : they would correspond to the h - bond stretching frequencies of different molecular aggregates , from dimer units to the tetrahedral pentamer units .",
    "these clusters inter - convert each other through breaking and making of the h - bonds ; this very fast process would result int the kdrj frequency jumps . the frequency and damping of the kdrj oscillator",
    "would be related to the h - bond stretching / bending vibrations and to their life time , respectively .",
    "the application of this picture to the oke data analysis suggests that liquid water consists of mixture of four different clusters , having comparable and weakly temperature dependent concentrations .",
    "the most recent experimental investigations@xcite , simulation studies@xcite and theoretical models@xcite do not support this scenario : the emerging picture is that water presents a bimodal local structuring ( i.e. formation of two main molecular clusters ) ; water molecules form local structures either tetrahedrally coordinated , named low - density forms , or close - packed , named high - density form . moreover , the relative populations of these two alternative local structures are strongly temperature dependent .      the mode - coupling theories ( mct)@xcite are a generalization of the mori and zwanzig approach .",
    "the liquid dynamics is described by the memory - function equations , which define the equations of motion of the correlation functions of physical observables .",
    "the retardation effects are taken into account by the memory functions @xmath110 , that in the mct are defined on the basis of the correlators .",

    "the time evolution of the correlation functions of these physical observables is given by the memory - function equations .",
    "they are formulated as  @xcite : @xmath113 with the memory function written as @xmath114 the smc model defines the memory by a series expansion ( up to the second term ) of the _ master correlator _ itself",

    "the smc model identifies the master correlator as the density correlator @xmath116 ; the quadratic term in eq . [ masterememo ] corresponds to the minimum order of the series expansion able of reproducing the slowing down behaviour of the structural relaxation .",
    "the dynamics of any other observable , @xmath117 , linked to the time dependent density ( e.g. to the local inter - molecular dynamics ) can be described by a similar differential equation  @xcite : @xmath118 in [ slaveeq ] the memory is given by @xmath119 @xmath120 being the _ slave correlator_. the coupling between the slave and master dynamics is assured by the product of the slave and master correlators in the memory kernel [ slavememo ] .",
    "equations [ mastereq ] , [ masterememo ] , [ slaveeq ] , and [ slavememo ] are a closed set that can be solved numerically , as analytic solutions exist only in a restricted number of cases@xcite .",
    "mct is essenzially a hydrodynamic model : than is hard to attribute a precise microscopic ( at the molecular level ) interpretation of the involved physical quantities ; the @xmath117 variables can be interpreted as key parameters influencing the liquid susceptibility .",
    "their dynamics , described by @xmath121 correlators , allow the calculation of the oke nuclear response function .",
    "the experimental response can be expressed as the time derivative of the sum of these slave correlators : @xmath122 in other words , equations [ slaveeq ] , [ slavememo ] and [ mct - response ] correspond to decomposing the electronic susceptibility correlator , @xmath12 , into the sum of @xmath123 correlators .",
    "each of these correlator describes an  average collective mode \" , whose dynamics is described by the smc equations .",

    "differently from other approaches , smc does not require any decoupling or dynamic separation between the fast / vibrational dynamics and the slow / relaxation phenomena .",

[ mct - response ] . of course , the result of the fit depends on the number of slave correlators included : we considered the cases corresponding to one , two , and three correlators .",
    "we performed a preliminary series of fits to obtain a qualitative estimate of the temperature dependence of the parameters . on that basis , we chose , in agreement with what already done in similar analyses reported in literature @xcite , to force some of the parameter either to assume fixed values or to follow pre - established temperature trends .",
    "we found that the oke data can be described in all the temperature range with three slave correlators at most .",
    "in particular , the weight of the highest frequency contribution decreases monotonically as the temperature increases , while it becomes negligible at the two highest temperatures , where only two slave correlators are sufficient to reproduce the data .    in fig .",
    "[ smc ] we show some of the measured hd - oke signals with the fits obtained using the smc model .",

    "most remarkably , and differently from other fitting models , this result is achieved without imposing any decoupling of vibrational and relaxation dynamics .    ,",

    "the characteristics of these two modes are clearly different in terms of spectral shape and temperature dependence . ]    in fig.[mct - fft ] we report the imaginary part of the fourier transform of the smc simulated oke responses obtained by the best fit of the experimental data at two temperatures .",
    "the contributions of the three slave correlators are reported in the figure as magenta - blue - orange lines .",
    "the simulation of hd - oke data by smc model requires two vibrational modes to fit the intermolecular stretching band of water ( blue and orange lines ) .",
    "the characteristics of these two modes are clearly different in terms of spectrum shape and temperature dependence . as discussed in a previous paper@xcite , these two modes can be associated with two fluctuating water species with different local structures ; a low - density form characterized by a tetrahedral network and a high - density form characterized by closely packed aggregates with lower coordination and high network distortions .",
    "two points of general relevance for the oke investigation of the dynamical properties of molecular liquids come out from the above discussion : i ) the analysis of the time domain oke response and , most of all , of its spectral representation , is critically dependent on the accurate determination of the instrumental function .",
    "only an absolutely faithful determination of the latter can provide a reproducible response function , susceptible to reliable detailed analysis ; ii ) extending the investigation to low temperatures is an essential requirement : different models can provide equivalent results at high temperature , while diverging in their heuristic power when confronted to low temperature experiments .",
    "in fact , only at low temperature non - exponential behaviors of the oke signal decay can show - up , and marked structuring of the oscillating part can grow - in .",
    "besides these general aspects , the main goal of our work has been that of analyzing the ability of different theoretical models to reproduce femtosecond hd - oke data of very high quality and accuracy .",
    "the three models that we considered derive from significantly different approaches .",
    "in particular , the kdrj model adopted by winkler et al.@xcite differs significantly from the others as it assumes that the oscillatory and diffusive dynamics of liquid water can be separated a priori .",
    "in fact , the long time relaxation is described as an exponential decay and is subtracted from the hd - oke time domain data , thus isolating the vibrational component . for the short time dynamics ,",
    "the authors adopt an essentially molecular picture , based a kubo treatment of the linewidth , which involves three intermolecular vibrational frequencies as stochastic variables .",
    "ref.@xcite takes into account only room temperature data : we show here that extending the analysis to low temperatures , well below the thermodynamic melting point , provides a much more stringent test of the theory .",
    "in fact , at low temperature not only the long time relaxation has to be described as a stretched exponential decay , but also the agreement for the oscillatory part of the oke response , very good at room temperature , is definitely less satisfactory in the supercooled regime . in any case",
    ", the kdrj approach accounts fairly well for the growing structuring of the oscillatory pattern at low temperatures .",
    "the other two models considered get rid of the imposed separation of the diffusive contribution from the overall dynamics , a separation that appears hardly justified in view of the similar time scales of the structural relaxation and of the intermolecular vibrations of liquid water . similarly to kdrj , the brownian oscillator ( mbo ) approach , employed for water by palese et al.@xcite , is based on an almost microscopic picture , whose dynamical variables consist of a collection of averaged local intermolecular modes .",
    "under - damped oscillators of relatively high frequency account for the oscillatory part of the response , while the structural relaxation contributions originate from the superposition of over - damped oscillators described by eqs.[somega ] and [ respmbotot ] .",
    "we found that the most critical parameter is the cut - off frequency @xmath44 in eq.[respmbotot ] : it is this low frequency limit that inhibits a good fit of the non - exponential decay present in the low temperature oke data .",
    "nevertheless this limit is imposed by the physical restriction that the oscillator period can not be longer than the structural rearrangement .",
    "the mode coupling ( smc ) treatment is based on a continuum picture of the liquid , and describes its dynamics on the basis of time correlation functions of physical observables .",
    "the key points are the non - linear form of the master memory function , eq.[masterememo ] , in the equation of motion of the density correlator , eq.[mastereq ] , and the inclusion of slave correlators coupled to the density correlator by the slave memory kernels , eq.[slavememo ] .",
    "we found that the smc model provides the most flexible set of equations and allows a very good fit at all temperatures of the oke data in the entire experimental time window .",
    "this approach is essentially hydrodynamic , hence no immediate link can be made between those correlators and the inter- and intra - molecular modes typical of a molecular - scale description of the dynamics . only in particular conditions",
    "a link with the specific molecular features can be out - lined@xcite . in this sense",
    ", it appears mostly suitable to the investigation of pre - transitional and critical phenomena .",
    "the most interesting feature of the smc analysis of the experimental data is that , using a rigorous physical approach and avoiding questionable assumptions , it allows disentangling dynamical contributions characterized by peculiar temperature ( and , possibly , pressure ) dependence .",
