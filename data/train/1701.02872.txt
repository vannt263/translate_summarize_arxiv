    "the fixed - cycle traffic - light ( fctl ) queue is an intensively studied and widely applied stochastic model in traffic engineering @xcite .",
    "vehicles arrive to an intersection controlled by a traffic light and form a queue .",
    "the fctl queue is traditionally modeled in discrete time .",
    "time is divided into slots of unit length , and each slot corresponds to the time needed for a delayed vehicle to depart from the queue .",
    "the green and red periods , of length @xmath0 and @xmath1 slots , respectively , and thus the cycle length @xmath2 , are assumed to be fixed multiples of one slot . those vehicles that arrive to the queue and",
    "are delayed , join the queue at the end of the slot in which they arrive .",
    "the key feature of the fctl queue , which distinguishes it from traditional queues , is formulated in the following assumption : * fctl assumption * for those cycles in which the queue clears before the green period terminates , all vehicles that arrive during the residual green period pass through the system and experience no delay whatsoever .",
    "the fctl assumption lets vehicles that arrive during the residual green period pass the intersection without slowing down , and therefore the discharge rate of these vehicles is larger than the discharge rate of the delayed vehicles ( one per time unit ) . because of the huge difference in discharge rates of delayed vehicles ( these vehicles have to accelerate ) and non - delayed vehicles , the fctl assumption is a sensible assumption .",
    "the fctl assumption does , however , have some severe consequences for the mathematical analysis of the queue length .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the queue length at time @xmath4 in cycle @xmath5 ( time expressed in slots ) .",
    "then , in cycle @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the queue length at the beginning of the green period , and @xmath7 the overflow defined as the queue length at the end of the green period ( and thus the beginning of the red period ) .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the total number of vehicles that arrive at the intersection in between the two measurements of the overflow @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath8 are the arrivals from @xmath7 onwards in a consecutive red and green period .",
    "further , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the number of delayed vehicles and @xmath12 the number of vehicles that pass without delay on behalf of the fctl assumption .",
    "the overflow queue can then be defined as @xmath13 the fact that @xmath11 depends on both @xmath7 and the exact specification of when the arrivals occur makes ( [ overflow ] ) hard to analyze . to capture that level of detail , let @xmath14 denote the number of vehicles that arrive to the intersection during slot @xmath4 in cycle @xmath5 .",
    "the random variables @xmath14 are assumed independent and identically distributed , for all @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "notice that the above assumptions together make that the queue lengths at the end of time slots can be modeled as a discrete - time markov chain .",
    "using analytic techniques suitable for dealing with such markov chains , darroch @xcite obtained the probability generating function ( pgf ) of the steady - state overflow queue ( the number of vehicles waiting in front of the traffic light at the end of a green period ) and the pgf of the steady - state delay was obtained in van leeuwaarden @xcite .",
    "hence , all information about the distribution of the steady - state overflow queue and steady - state delay in the fctl queue can be obtained from the results in @xcite , including all moments of the steady - state queue length and delay , and the distribution of the output process ( the way vehicles leave the intersection ) .    the classical fctl treatment in @xcite , however , comes with the disadvantage that numerical evaluation is computationally cumbersome .",
    "this is because the probability generating function ( pgf ) for the stationary queue length distribution contains @xmath15 boundary terms that need to be found separately .",
    "the traditional way of determining these remaining unknowns consists of two steps : finding the @xmath15 complex - valued roots and using these roots as input for a system of linear equations whose solution gives the boundary terms .",
    "both steps can present numerical difficulties , but were somehow assumed unavoidable in the mathematically rigorous treatment of the fctl queue @xcite and of related bulk - service queues @xcite .    * paper outline . *",
    "we present in section [ sec : main ] the main result of the paper , an alternative representation for the transform solution in terms of a contour integral .",
    "we also explain how these contour integrals lead to algorithms that are more efficient than existing algorithms .",
    "we present these algorithms in section [ sec : num ] and show their effectiveness .",
    "the proof of our main result is presented in section [ sec : proof ] and uses several basic notions from complex analysis .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : con ] , and discuss the scope of application of our proof method and how the contour integrals might be used for asymptotic analysis .",
    "we now briefly review the standard solution method for obtaining an exact transform solution for the steady - state fctl queue .",
    "we then present the alternative contour integral representation .",
    "assume @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 to be analytic in a region @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 maximal .",
    "the key quantity in the mathematical analysis of the fctl queue is the steady - state overflow queue , defined as @xmath22 .",
    "clearly , to have stability , and for @xmath23 to be well defined , @xmath24<g.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the kernel method and transform techniques , the pgf of @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath25 $ ] can be obtained using a by now classical line of reasoning .",
    "introduce two more pgfs @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27={\\mathbb{e}}^c[z^y]$ ] .",
    "then it can be shown that @xcite @xmath28 this expression still contains @xmath0 unknowns @xmath29 , which can be found by exploiting the analytic properties of pgfs .",
    "with rouch s theorem , it can be shown that the denominator of ( [ pgf ] ) has @xmath0 zeros on or within the unit circle @xmath30 .",
    "because a pgf is analytic and well - defined in @xmath31 , the numerator of @xmath32 should vanish at each of the zeros .",
    "this gives @xmath0 equations .",
    "one of the zeros equals 1 , and leads to a trivial equation .",
    "however , the normalization condition @xmath33 provides an additional equation .",
    "so that summarizes the highest level of general development for fctl queue analysis : transform techniques yield an expression for @xmath32 that in order to be evaluated demands finding @xmath15 roots in the complex plane of the function @xmath34 and solving a set of @xmath0 linear equations .",
    "we now turn to the alternative expression for @xmath32 .",
    "here is the main result in this paper :    [ mainttt ] there is an @xmath35 such that for all @xmath36 @xmath37 with principal value of the logarithm .",
    "the formula for @xmath38 is essentially equivalent with @xmath39 except that the validity range is more delicate due to the more complicated argument of the @xmath40 in  .",
    "formula follows upon manipulating using partial integration ( details in section [ sec : proof ] ) .    * towards better numerical algorithms . *",
    "the elegant contour - integral representation requires model primitives as sole input",
    ". this representation will be the basis for effective algorithms .",
    "for the empty - queue probability and all moments we obtain explicit contour integrals by considering the derivatives of @xmath38 at @xmath41 .",
    "these contour integrals can be evaluated numerically in a straightforward and fast manner . for calculating the entire steady - state distribution",
    "we use numerical transform inversion based on the symbolic computation of all derivatives of @xmath38 at @xmath42 .",
    "the resulting algorithms are the first to not use complex - valued roots and remarkably elegant and simple compared with existing algorithms .",
    "the contour integrals and numerical implementations are discussed in section [ sec : num ] .",
    "there we also discuss how the algorithms for the overflow queue carry over to similar algorithms for the steady - state delay distribution",
    ".    * historical notes . *",
    "integrals of this sort go a long way back in the history of queueing theory and were first found in the ground - breaking work of pollaczek on the classical single - server queue ( see @xcite for historical accounts ) .",
    "let us point out the connection to the well known pollaczek type integral for the discrete bulk - service queue @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the fctl queue is greatly simplified if all vehicles were delayed @xcite , so that all vehicles arrive while the queue length is at least one and the complicated @xmath11 random variable in can be replaced by @xmath8 . in that case",
    "becomes a standard stochastic recursion driven by i.i.d .",
    "random variables and the fctl queue reduces to the classical bulk - service queue , a special case of the more general single - server queue investigated by pollaczek",
    ". let @xmath43 denote the steady - state queue length in that bulk - service queue , defined as the solution of the stochastic equation @xmath44 pollaczek s result then says that ( see @xcite for a direct derivation ) @xmath45 holds when @xmath46 with @xmath47 positive and bounded by some constant .",
    "observe the striking similarity with . while the fctl queue is harder to analyze than the bulk - service queue ,",
    "the two contour - integral representations and only differ in the logarithmic function .",
    "the authors find this quite surprising themselves , particularly because there seems no way to interpret the fctl queue as a reflected random walk ( that is , a recursive structure with i.i.d .  increments ) , while in the literature so far this seems to be a prerequisite for establishing pollaczek - type contour integrals .",
    "do observe that is valid in an area that includes the unit disk while is guaranteed only in an open set containing @xmath48 $ ] , see section [ sec : proof ] .",
    "this objection does not hold against the representation of @xmath38",
    ".    * bernoulli arrivals .",
    "* the bulk - service queue serves as a popular approximation of the fctl queue @xcite .",
    "in fact , for bernoulli arrivals , so per time slot one or no arrival , this approximation becomes exact . to see this , substitute @xmath49 into the logarithmic function in , and observe that this gives the logarithmic function in . obviously , when @xmath50 can take values larger than one , the bulk - service queue is an approximation and yields an upper bound on the overflow queue .",
    "* sketch of the proof .",
    "* the proof will find a way to go from representation to contour integrals .",
    "a significant start in this direction was made by @xcite , who rewrote as @xmath51 then denote the @xmath0 roots of @xmath34 on and within the unit circle by @xmath52 .",
    "now here is where the authors in @xcite took an eye - opening step : instead of using the @xmath0 roots in the traditional manner for finding the unknowns @xmath53 and completing the transform , use these roots for factorizing the numerator of .",
    "notice that this can not be done immediately , because interpreted as a function of @xmath54 , the numerator is by no means a polynomial of degree @xmath0 or less .",
    "however , by treating the function @xmath55 as a variable itself , the summation in the numerator is a polynomial of degree @xmath15 and can be factorized as @xmath56 after normalization using @xmath33 the factorization in leads to the representation @xmath57 our proof then proceeds by interpreting as the outcome of cauchy s residue theorem , the classical tool from complex analysis to evaluate line integrals of analytic functions over closed curves .",
    "an important step is to write @xmath58 and to regard as the sum of residues at @xmath59 . to construct an analytic function that , in conjunction with cauchy s theorem and the closed curve @xmath60 , returns and has singularities at @xmath61 , leads us to consider the integrand in .",
    "here , the logarithmic function @xmath62 follows from and the singularities with appropriate residues are created through @xmath63 . after careful consideration of the analytic properties of the integrand in",
    ", we then show that cauchy s theorem gives from which follows .",
    "as said , is obtained by manipulating , using partial integration .",
    "the formal proof of theorem [ mainttt ] presented in section [ sec : proof ] contains several challenging steps , and requires among other things a proof that the function @xmath55 is injective in a region that contains the unit disk , and a way to account for the branch cut caused by the logarithm in being taken over negative values .",
    "we now demonstrate how the integral representation in theorem [ mainttt ] yields efficient algorithms for effectively all stationary performance metrics , including the stationary moments and queue length distribution .",
    "the algorithms in this section are based on the representation ( but one could also take ) .",
    "note that we only expand @xmath38 at @xmath64 and @xmath41 , so inside the validity range of .",
    "the mean stationary overflow queue @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 and takes the form @xmath67 this result was recently obtained in @xcite using a direct proof that converted the classical expression for @xmath65 in terms of complex valued roots into the integral expression .    from the pgf @xmath32 we can in principle determine all stationary moments .",

    "@xmath72 can be expressed in terms of @xmath73 and the first @xmath4 derivatives of @xmath73 , denoted by @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , for @xmath77 . after substituting @xmath41",

    "observe that @xmath108 is practically zero when @xmath109 , but as high as @xmath110 when @xmath99 , which means that only in 16% of the cycles the green time is long enough to let the queue vanish .",

    "with theorem [ mainttt ] , numerically evaluating the fctl queue only involves calculating elementary contour integrals .",

    "a prominent line of research is related to heavy traffic , an asymptotic regime in which the traffic intensity approaches 100% .",
    "next to more probabilistic methods such as weak convergence techniques and coupling , another way to obtain heavy - traffic results is through the asymptotic evaluation of pollaczek - type integrals ; see e.g.  @xcite for single - server queues and @xcite for classical bulk - queues .",
