    "elliptic flow  ( @xmath1 ) is one of the key observables in the understanding of the dynamics of heavy ion collisions . in the collision of two nuclei with finite impact parameter ,",
    "the overlap region in the plane transverse to the beam direction is spatially asymmetric .",
    "observation of an azimuthal anisotropy in the momentum distributions of the detected particles relative to the reaction plane is direct evidence of interactions between the initially produced particles  @xcite .",
    "these interactions must occur at relatively early times , since the expansion of the source even if uniform would wash out the effect of the initial asymmetry .",
    "quantitatively , the connection between the initial and final - state anisotropy is exploited by hydrodynamical models that relate a given initial source shape to the distribution of produced particles . in such calculations ,",
    "one typically uses smooth , event - averaged , initial conditions .",
    "however , event - by - event fluctuations in the shape of the initial interaction region must not be neglected . as a means to quantify the effect of initial - state eccentricity fluctuations , we have introduced the `` participant eccentricity '' , @xmath2 .",
    "it unifies the eccentricity - scaled elliptic flow across cu+cu and au+au collisions  @xcite . it to quantify the effect of initial - state eccentricity fluctuations , we have introduced the `` participant eccentricity '' , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the per - event of the participant nucleon position distributions in the transverse plane .",
    "it unifies the eccentricity - scaled flow , @xmath7 , for cu+cu and au+au collisions , as a function of particle area density  ( or centrality ) .",
    "its magnitude and shape as a function of centrality are rather robust to variations of the glauber parameters  @xcite .",
    "the participant eccentricity accounts for nucleon - position fluctuations in the participating nucleon distributions by calculating the eccentricity , event - by - event , with respect to the principal axes of the overlap ellipse in a monte carlo glauber  ( mcg ) simulation . in a hydrodynamical scenario ,",
    "such fluctuations in the shape of the initial collision region would lead naturally to corresponding fluctuations in the elliptic flow signal . to estimate their magnitude , we assume that @xmath8 , derived from hydrodynamical calculations , holds event - by - event .",
    "this leads to @xmath9 , where @xmath10  ( @xmath11 ) is the standard deviation of the event - by - event distribution @xmath1  ( @xmath12 ) . neglecting all other sources of elliptic flow fluctuations ,",
    "our participant eccentricity mcg simulation predicts relative fluctuations  ( @xmath13 ) of in au+au collisions at @xmath14  gev . for all but the most central collisions ,",
    "this is more than a factor of 2 larger than estimations based on merely @xmath15 driven fluctuations , and of similar size as expected from statistical fluctuations .",
    "note that the measurement of @xmath1 fluctuations as a probe of early stage dynamics of heavy ion collisions has been suggested earlier  @xcite , although without considering the possibility of initial - state eccentricity fluctuations . in order to experimentally determine elliptic flow fluctuations ,",
    "we have developed an analysis technique for the extraction of dynamical flow fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "our method , summarized below , relies crucially on the large pseudo - rapidity coverage of the phobos multiplicity array , which detects a very large fraction of the produced particles  @xcite .",
    "the results as a function of centrality in @xmath14  gev au+au collisions at mid - rapidity are for the first time presented in these conference proceedings .",
    "in order to disentangle known  ( mostly statistical ) from unknown  ( dynamical ) contri - butions to the measured flow fluctuations , a detailed knowledge of the detector response is required .",
    "the response function , @xmath16 , is defined as the distribution of the event - by - event observed elliptic flow ,  @xmath17 , for events with constant input flow value ,  @xmath1 , and multiplicity ,  @xmath18 .",
    "it is designed to account for detector deficiencies , as well as for multiplicity and finite - number fluctuations .",
    "our analysis method is designed to disentangle known  ( mostly statistical ) from unknown  ( dynamical ) contributions to the measured flow fluctuations .",
    "typically , one assumes that both contributions add in quadrature , according to .",
    "this relation holds , if the average of the measurement , @xmath19 , agrees with the true average in the data , @xmath20 , and if the resolution of the method is independent of the true value .",
    "since neither of both conditions are fully satisfied in our event - by - event measurement of @xmath1 , a more detailed knowledge of the detector response is required .",
    "the resolution depends on the magnitude of the flow signal and event multiplicity .",
    "thus , we define the response function , @xmath16 , as the distribution of the event - by - event observed elliptic flow ,  @xmath17 , for events with constant input flow value ,  @xmath1 , and multiplicity ,  @xmath18 . as explained below , it is not only designed to account for detector deficiencies , but also for multiplicity and finite - number fluctuations .",

    "our analysis method consists of three steps :    1 .",
    "measurement of the observed @xmath26 distribution , @xmath22 , for a set of events by measuring @xmath17 event - by - event .",

    "the fit makes use of all hits from the multiplicity array for the measurement of a single value , @xmath17 , while it efficiently corrects for non - uniformities in the acceptance of the participating sub - detector systems .",
    "the probability distribution function  ( pdf ) of a particle to be emitted in the direction  ( @xmath28 ) for an event with mid - rapidity flow amplitude @xmath29 and reaction plane angle @xmath30 is defined as .",
    "the pseudorapidity dependence , @xmath31 , is parametrized with a triangular shape , , or alternatively with a trapezoidal shape , .",
    "both parametrizations yield good descriptions of the previously measured  ( mean ) @xmath31 shapes  @xcite .",
    "the normalization  ( @xmath32 ) is constructed such that the pdf folded with the phobos acceptance  ( @xmath33 ) yields the same value for different sets of parameters  ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 \\ , { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\phi'\\,{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\eta'$ ] , in practice constructed in small bins of @xmath36 .",
    "the desired value @xmath37 is given by the pair  ( @xmath38 ) that is `` most likely '' for the given event , found by maximizing @xmath39 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath30 for all hits in the event .",

    "flow of constant magnitude  ( @xmath1 ) with a flat reaction plane distribution  ( @xmath30 ) is introduced into the generated hijing events .",
    "this is achieved by redistributing the resulting particles in each event in @xmath41 according to @xmath42 , using their generated @xmath43 positions .",
    "the modified hijing events are fed through geant  @xciteto obtain the phobos detector response . for each parametrization of @xmath31 , triangular and trapezoidal , used in the event - by - event measurement , a corresponding kernel , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ,",
    "is constructed . to obtain",
    "the kernel in bins of @xmath1 and @xmath18 with enough precision would require on the order of 100 million mc events .",
    "instead the kernel can be parametrized , allowing us to use about 1.5% of that statistics to reach the required precision .",

    "the analysis chain is applied to the @xmath14  gev au+au data set from run  4 in bins of centrality .",
    "the results  ( @xmath55 and @xmath10 ) are obtained separately for triangular and trapezoidal @xmath31 shape and averaged over bins of collision vertex position .",
    "the systematic errors  ( all sources added in quadrature ) are estimated by including variations from different vertex and @xmath57 bins and changes introduced by the triangular and trapezoidal @xmath31 shapes . since the functional form of the true distribution is unknown ,",
    "differences arising from a flat rather than a gaussian ansatz for @xmath21 are included .",
    "furthermore , we have performed extensive studies of the analysis response to mc samples , prepared to match the observed multiplicity distribution and @xmath58 , in bins of centrality and known input values of fluctuations  ( including zero ) .",
    "the discrepancies of the obtained to the input fluctuations evaluated per centrality bin are an additional source of the systematic error .",
    "their contribution becomes increasingly important for low values of @xmath1 , and therefore the most central collision bin ( ) was excluded from the analysis .",
