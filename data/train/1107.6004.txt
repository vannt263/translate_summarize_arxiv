    "consider a process which is repeated @xmath1 times and each repetition has @xmath0 possible outcomes . for concreteness we may think of assigning @xmath1 balls to @xmath0 labelled boxes , where each box can hold any number of balls .",
    "the first ball can go into any box , the second ball can go into any box , ... , and the @xmath1th ball can go into any box .",
    "each assignment or allocation is thus a sequence of @xmath1 box labels and results in some number @xmath3 of balls in box 1 , @xmath4 in box 2 , etc . , where the @xmath5 are @xmath6 and sum to @xmath1",
    ". there are @xmath7 possible assignments in all , and many of them can lead to the same count vector @xmath8 .",
    "we refer to these assignments as the _ realizations _ of the count vector .",
    "the arrangement of @xmath1 balls into @xmath0 boxes can represent the construction of any object consisting of @xmath0 distinguishable parts out of @xmath1 identical units .",
    "so if the balls represent pixels of an image , the attributes of color and ( suitably discretized ) intensity are ascribed to the boxes to which the pixels are assigned",
    ". then the count vector is thought of as a 2-dimensional matrix with rows labelled by intensity and columns by color .",
    "other examples are people categorized by age , height , and weight , vehicles classified by weight , size , and fuel economy , packets in a communications network with attributes of origin , destination , size , and timestamp , etc .",
    "the object can even be a ( discrete ) probability distribution .",
    "when the process simply represents the classification of @xmath1 units by @xmath0 discrete or discretized attibutes , it is known as a ( multi - dimensional ) contingency table .    now consider imposing constraints @xmath9 on the allowable assignments , expressed as a set of _ linear _ relations on the elements of the _ frequency _ vector @xmath10 corresponding to the counts @xmath11",
    "e.g. @xmath12 , @xmath13 , etc .",
    "as @xmath1 grows , the frequency vectors of more and more of the assignments that satisfy the constrtaints will have _ entropy _ closer and closer to that of a particular @xmath0-vector @xmath14 , the vector of _ maximum entropy _",
    "@xmath15 subject to the constraints @xmath9 .",
    "( we denote this vector by @xmath14 , as opposed to @xmath16 , to emphasize that its entries are , in general , not rational . )",
    "this result is known , more or less , in many forms : the original is e.t .",
    "jaynes s `` entropy concentration theorem '' @xcite , @xcite , in the information theory literature it is the `` conditional limit theorem '' @xcite , and in computer science there is `` strong entropy concentration '' @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all these results involve limits or asymptotics in one way or another , i.e. in the statement    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     to interpret the first line of table [ tab : q ] , suppose we choose @xmath17 .",
    "we then find @xmath18by corollary [ cor : pd ] , this rational approximation to the maxent p.d .",
    "( [ eq : phisq ] ) has at least @xmath19 times more realizations than the entire set of p.d.s which satisfy the constraints to accuracy @xmath20 but differ from the p.d .",
    "( @xmath21 ) by more than 0.01 in @xmath22 norm .",
    "the phenomenon of entropy concentration appears when a large number of units is allocated to containers subject to constraints that are linear functions of the numbers of units in each container : most allocations will result in frequency ( normalized count ) vectors with entropy close to that of the vector of maximum entropy that satisfies the constraints .",
    "asymptotic proofs of this phenomenon are known , beginning with the work of e. t. jaynes , but here we presented a formulation entirely devoid of probabilities and provided explicit bounds on how large the number of units must be for concentration to any desired degree to occur .",
    "our formulation also deals with the fact that constraints can not be satisfied exactly by rational frequencies , but only to some prescribed tolerances , and also eliminates ( as opposed to `` resolves '' ) the well - known issue of expectations vs. measurements in constraints .",
    "in addition , we established a perhaps more useful version of the concentration result , in terms of deviation from the maximum entropy vector , instead of the usual maximum entropy value , as well as results that pertain to the maximum entropy vector itself and not to a whole set of vectors around it . because of its conceptual simplicity and minimality of assumptions ,",
    "entropy concentration is a powerful justification of the widely - used discrete maxent method ( the other being axiomatic formulations ) , and we believe that the explicit , non - asymptotic bounds strengthen it considerably .",
    "all of our results were illustrated with detailed numerical examples .",
    "thanks to david applegate for discussing with me what can be done , howard karloff for telling me what ca nt be done , steve korotky for our many discussions on entropy and networks , and neil sloane for many informative discussions , answering many questions , in particular about latttice points , and for his careful reading of the paper .",

    "the adjustment of @xmath24to @xmath25 ensures @xmath26 , which establishes the @xmath27 claim . in more detail ,",
    "the 0 elements of @xmath25 coincide with those of @xmath14 , and this adjustment causes at most @xmath28 of the non - zero elements of @xmath25 to differ from the corresponding elements of @xmath29 by @xmath30 , so @xmath31 .",
    "hence @xmath32 , which establishes the claim for the @xmath22 norm .",
    "beginning with the equality constraints ( [ eq : constr2e ] ) , note that @xmath33 .",
    "set @xmath34 .",
    "then we have @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "now  @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the matrix infinity norm ( also known as the `` maximum row sum '' norm ) . the inequality holds because the vector norm @xmath39 is _ compatible _ with the ( rectangular ) matrix norm @xmath40 ( see @xcite ,  5.7 ) .",
    "so if we make @xmath41 , we will have @xmath42 , as required by ( [ eq : constr2e ] ) . the inequality constraints ( [ eq : constr2i ] ) are handled in exacty the same way .",
    "theorem 16.3.2 of @xcite is a similar result , but in terms of the @xmath22 norm .",
    "the function @xmath45 , @xmath46 $ ] , is concave and has a maximum at @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be @xmath49 , and consider the difference of the values of @xmath50 at two points that are @xmath51 apart : @xmath52 . since @xmath53 always , the maximum of @xmath54 occurs at @xmath55 and equals @xmath56 .",
    "so if @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( this is tighter than what we would get by simply applying the defining inequality of concavity to @xmath59 . ) we have now shown that if @xmath60 , then @xmath61 .",
    "the result of the proposition follows .      using proposition [ prop : norment0 ] , we want to find a @xmath62 s.t .",

    "we want to find a @xmath67 s.t . for all @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "we claim that this inequality , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 is expected to be @xmath72 , is satisfied by @xmath73 , for any @xmath74 .",
    "indeed , @xmath75 which is possible for any @xmath74 if @xmath76 is large enough . with @xmath77 ,",
    "this condition is @xmath78 . but",
    "this holds for @xmath79 , a very mild requirement .",
    "finally , the function @xmath80 is increasing for @xmath81 , so the l.h.s . of ( [ eq : haty ] ) will hold for all @xmath68 as desired .",
    "we have now shown that @xmath82 will hold if @xmath59 is s.t . @xmath83 where the `` @xmath84 '' can be tightened to @xmath85 .",
    "begin with @xmath86 and use the fact that @xmath87 which is defined for all @xmath88 by @xmath89 .",
    "then we find @xmath90 finally , for the upper bound in prop .",
    "[ prop : s ] , the sum of the last two terms is maximized when @xmath91 . for the lower bound",
    ", it is minimized when @xmath92 .",
    "we begin by observing that the sum over  @xmath93 is bounded above by the sum over all of @xmath94 and then use the bound of proposition [ prop : s ] on @xmath95 to find @xmath96 to evaluate the last sum , let @xmath97 be the subset of @xmath94 consisting of vectors with @xmath98 non - zero elements . since the @xmath97 form a partition of @xmath94 , @xmath99 where the @xmath100 comes from the fact that as pointed out in proposition [ prop : s ] , @xmath95 depends only on the non - zero elements and not on their positions .",
    "thus @xmath101 we now need an auxiliary result on the inner sum in ( [ eq : ss ] ) :      proposition [ prop : sumint ] is proved separately later . using this result in ( [ eq : ss ] ) , @xmath104 for the first inequality we used @xmath105 and for the second we assumed that @xmath106 and @xmath107 . combining the above with ( [ eq : nrb1 ] ) , and again assuming @xmath106 we obtain the result of the lemma .      ignoring the rational requirement for the moment and denoting @xmath59 by @xmath108 ,",
    "only @xmath109 are independent , so our set is the subset of @xmath110 belonging to @xmath111 we will construct inside this set an @xmath112-dimensional rectangular parallelepiped @xmath113 whose intersection with @xmath94 is easy to count . to construct @xmath113",
    "we will determine its two extreme points , the one with the largest coordinates , @xmath114 , and the one with the smallest , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath114 satisfies ( [ eq : krs ] ) , then @xmath117 the 4th inequality is true , and the 2nd implies the first .",
    "the 2nd and 3d inequalities are satisfied if @xmath118 , and @xmath119 will be maximized if @xmath120 since @xmath14 has @xmath121 non - zero elements , we can assume w.l.o.g .",
    "that @xmath122 .    similarly , for the other extreme point @xmath115 we must have @xmath123 and @xmath124 . if some @xmath125 are 0 the corresponding @xmath126 are 0 , and w.l.o.g .",
    "we can take the non - zero @xmath126 to be @xmath127 .",
    "then the @xmath126 that satisfy the inequalities and maximize the product @xmath128 are @xmath129 but this needs @xmath130 for all the non - zero @xmath125 , which we have assumed .",
    "thus from ( [ eq : py ] ) and ( [ eq : pz ] ) @xmath131 sides of @xmath113 have length @xmath132 , and the other @xmath133 sides have length @xmath134 . again",
    ". we can take @xmath135 to be @xmath136 , the largest element of @xmath14 .",
    "so if we assume that @xmath137 , @xmath113 has @xmath138 sides of length @xmath139 and @xmath133 sides of length @xmath140 .",
    "now a @xmath141-dimensional parallelepiped with sides of lengths @xmath142 , irrespective of its location in @xmath143 , contains at least @xmath144 lattice points , i.e. points in @xmath145 .",
    "( this can be established by induction on @xmath141 . for @xmath146",
    "it says that a segment of length @xmath147 on the real axis contains at least @xmath148 integers . )",
    "applying this to @xmath113 with all its @xmath149 dimensions scaled up by @xmath1 , the scaled @xmath113 must contain at least @xmath150 points whose coordinates are rational numbers with denominator @xmath1 , i.e. vectors in @xmath94 .",
    "the first factor and its attendant condition @xmath151 are absent if @xmath152 .",
    "let @xmath153 be some constant whose purpose is expained later , in the proof of theorem [ th:1 ] .",
    "we begin by deriving a lower bound on the size of @xmath154 , a subset of @xmath155 .",
    "consider the set @xmath156 . since @xmath157 , proposition [ prop : theta_inf ] implies that any@xmath59 in this set also belongs to @xmath158 .",
    "further , by the middle expression in the definition of @xmath159 , proposition [ prop : norment ] implies that any such @xmath59 also has entropy at least  @xmath160 .",
    "thus all @xmath59 in the set @xmath161 belong to @xmath162 .",
    "finally @xmath159 satisfies the conditions of proposition [ prop : anlb ] , hence the size of @xmath161 is bounded from below by @xmath163 .",
    "but @xmath164 , so we established the first claim of the lemma .",
    "now suppose that all @xmath59 in @xmath154 have at least @xmath165 non - zero elements ; for the purposes of this proof we may take these to be the first @xmath98 elements .",
    "then by proposition [ prop : s ] , if @xmath166 is an arbitrary element of @xmath154 , @xmath167 let @xmath168 ; this vector has integral entries , all positive , and summing to @xmath1 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath169 equals @xmath170 , occurring when @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "thus the exponential in ( [ eq : a ] ) is at least @xmath173 .",
    "further , the maximum of @xmath174 subject to @xmath175 occurs at @xmath176 , so the last factor in ( [ eq : a ] ) is at least @xmath177 .",
    "finally @xmath178 , and so ( [ eq : a ] ) implies the second result of the lemma , but with the number @xmath98 still undetermined . by requiring @xmath179 to be less than the smallest non - zero element of @xmath14 , we can ensure that there is no element of @xmath59 which is 0 while the corresponding element of @xmath14 is positive ; this is accomplished by the last term on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : theta0 ] ) .",
    "thus we can take @xmath98 equal to @xmath180 , the number of non - zero elements of @xmath14 .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath181 and the lower bound on @xmath182 are given by lemmas [ le : nrbn ] and [ le : nran ] .",
    "both these bounds _ increase _ when the entropy tolerance @xmath183 decreases towards 0 , as makes sense . to simplify the proof",
    "we assume that @xmath184 . then combining the two bounds and unifying",
    "some numerical constants @xmath185 when everything else is fixed , this lower bound on @xmath186 ( eventually ) increases as @xmath187 , as we want it to .",
    "in general , this behavior would have been impossible if @xmath188 were 1 .",
    "this is why we introduced @xmath188 and required it to be @xmath189 : it serves to strictly separate our bounds on @xmath182 and @xmath181 .",
    "there is freedom in choosing the value of @xmath188 , which we exploit below .    to establish ( [ eq : ratio ] ) we need the l.h.s . of ( [ eq : nranrb ] ) to be @xmath190 .",
    "this reduces to requiring @xmath191 where the constants @xmath192 are @xmath193 we will now show that ( [ eq : n1 ] ) is satisfied by @xmath194 first , assume @xmath195 . setting @xmath196 in ( [ eq : n1 ] ) with @xmath146",
    "we reduce to @xmath197 the r.h.s . of this condition",
    "is a convex combination of @xmath198 and 1 , so the first condition will hold if @xmath199 , which is true when @xmath200 .",
    "now let @xmath201 .",
    "putting @xmath202 in ( [ eq : n1 ] ) , we reduce to establishing @xmath203 , which will hold if @xmath204 , always true .    the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : n11 ] )",
    "depends on @xmath205 , which has up to this point been left unspecified .",
    "we finally need @xmath206 and @xmath207 , and we observe that as  @xmath208 , the first of these bounds increases while the second decreases .",
    "further , the first bound is finite at 0 and infinite at 1 , whereas the second is infinite at 0 and finite at 1 .",
    "thus there is an optimal @xmath188 which makes the two bounds equal , the @xmath209 which solves @xmath210 .",
    "consider the simplest case @xmath212 first .",
    "we can bound the sum as follows : @xmath213 to see this , note that @xmath214 because the sum is a lower riemann sum for the integral . since the summand is symmetric about @xmath215",
    ", doubling this produces the desired result .",
    "now consider the case of even @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath216 . divide the @xmath5 into @xmath217 pairs , each of which sums to some number @xmath218 and these numbers in turn sum to @xmath1 : @xmath219 here the inequality follows by applying ( [ eq : mu=2 ] ) , which does not depend on @xmath1 , to each of the inner sums .",
    "further , @xmath220 where in the first equality we assume w.l.o.g . that @xmath221 , and the 2nd equality follows from the fact that the number of compositions of @xmath222 into @xmath223 parts ( i.e. the solutions of @xmath224 , @xmath225 ) , is @xmath226",
    ". finally we bound the binomial coefficient by @xmath227 , to arrive at @xmath228 now we turn to the case of odd @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath229 . similarly to what we did above , @xmath230 by ( [ eq : mueven ] ) , the r.h.s",
    ". does not exceed @xmath231 and this last sum can be bounded by the integral @xmath232 we have thus shown that for @xmath229 , @xmath233 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mueven ] ) and ( [ eq : muodd ] ) establish the proposition for all @xmath102 .",
    "first we show that if @xmath234 then @xmath235 . by proposition [ prop : n1 ] ,",
    "@xmath236 , so by proposition [ prop : theta_inf ] @xmath237 .",
    "further , @xmath238 means that @xmath239 by proposition [ prop : norment ] .",
    "therefore @xmath240 implies that @xmath16 belongs to the set @xmath241 as claimed .",
    "next we put a lower bound on @xmath242 . applying proposition [ prop : s ]",
    "we see that @xmath95 is @xmath243 the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ eq : a ] ) in the proof of lemma [ le : nran ] with @xmath244 , so @xmath95 is @xmath243 the bound of lemma [ le : nran ] on @xmath245 with @xmath246 .",
    "then from the proof of theorem [ th:1 ] , we see that @xmath247 is @xmath243 the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : nranrb ] ) , but with the condition on @xmath1 being @xmath248 .",
    "the rest of the proof of theorem [ th:1 ] then applies , to the point where @xmath1 has to satisfy @xmath206 and @xmath249 .",
    "@xmath209 equalizes these bounds , and the completion of the proof of theorem [ th:1 ] then establishes that if @xmath250 , @xmath251 .",
    "the function @xmath252 , @xmath107 , is increasing for @xmath253 $ ] .",
    "the first implication in the proposition then follows immediately from theorem 16.3.2 of @xcite , the @xmath22 norm bound on entropy , which states that if two @xmath0-vectors @xmath254 are s.t .",
    "@xmath255 , then @xmath256 .",
    "to prove the second implication we use pinsker s inequality and the `` triangle inequality '' for cross- or relative entropy , or divergence @xmath257 .",
    "applied to @xmath59 and @xmath14 , pinsker s inequality states that @xmath258 ( see @xcite , lemma 12.6.1 ) .",
    "then the triangle inequality , using the uniform distribution as the prior or reference distribution ( @xcite , theorem 12.6.1 ) , implies that @xmath259 . what we want to prove follows from the above two inequalities .",
    "pinsker s inequality can be tightened in two ways : @xcite show that the @xmath260 can be replaced by a factor @xmath261 , and @xcite give right - hand sides that are polynomials involving powers of the norm beyond the square .      entirely analogous to that of lemma [ le : nrbn ] , except that the set @xmath262 is defined by ( [ eq : newanbn ] ) instead of ( [ eq : bn ] ) , and the factor @xmath263 in ( [ eq : nrb1 ] ) , coming from the upper bound on @xmath95 of proposition [ prop : s ] , is replaced by the factor @xmath264 of proposition [ prop : norment2 ] .",
    "the proof follows that of lemma [ le : nran ] : first we lower - bound the size of @xmath265 and then the entropy of the @xmath59 in it .",
    "the basic difference is that here we have @xmath22 norms .",
    "if @xmath266 , so is @xmath267 , and then proposition [ prop : anlb ] says that the size of @xmath268 is at least @xmath269 .",
    "second , concerning the entropy of @xmath270 , by proposition [ prop : norment2 ] @xmath271 implies that @xmath272 is at least @xmath273 .",
    "the proof then follows that of  lemma [ le : nran ] , except that the term @xmath274 in ( [ eq : a ] ) is replaced by @xmath275 .",
    "the proof uses lemmas [ le : nrbn1 ] and [ le : nran1 ] and is completely analogous to that of theorem [ th:1 ] .",
    "the main feature is that @xmath15 falls out of the new ( [ eq : nranrb ] ) , the exponential is @xmath281 with @xmath282 , and the condition on @xmath1 is now @xmath283 .",
    "@xmath192 are the same as in theorem [ th:1 ] , except for the denominators . finally , @xmath284 is finite at @xmath285 and increases to @xmath286 at @xmath287 , whereas @xmath288 is infinite at @xmath285 and decreases to a finite value at @xmath289 .",
    "thus the equation @xmath290 has a root @xmath209 between 0 and @xmath291 , which equates the two sides and is therefore the optimal @xmath188 .",
    "the proof is analogous to that of lemma [ cor:1 ] .",
    "first , by proposition [ prop : n1 ] , @xmath292 implies that @xmath293 .",
    "second , if @xmath294 then @xmath295 by the 2nd claim of proposition [ prop : n1 ] .",
