    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is one of the most interesting topics in quantum information processing , which allows the sender ( alice ) and the receiver ( bob ) to share a secret key with negligibly leakage of information to an eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "this task is accomplished by making use of the properties of quantum mechanics , such as no - cloning theorem @xcite , indistinguishability of nonorthogonal quantum states , entanglement , and so on @xcite . the b92 protocol @xcite , where only two nonorthogonal states are used , is thought to be secure due to the fact that eve can not clone and distinguish the states deterministically .",
    "although the qualitative reason of the security is simple , it is quite hard to show the quantitative security against so - called coherent attack , which is the most general attack allowed by quantum mechanics . in @xcite ,",
    "the security of the bb84 protocol @xcite is proven by showing the relationship between qkd and other important protocols in quantum information , such as the entanglement distillation protocol ( edp ) @xcite and the calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) quantum error correcting codes @xcite . recently in @xcite ,",
    "the unconditional security of the b92 protocol has been proved by relating the b92 protocol to an entanglement distillation protocol ( edp ) @xcite initiated by local filtering @xcite .",
    "the assumptions of the proof are that alice and bob s devises are perfect and the quantum channel is loss - free .",
    "to study the unconditional security of b92 protocol over a lossy and noisy channel is interesting from the point of view of the quantum information theory , since the channel loss directly affects the security of the b92 protocol .",
    "the proof based on the equivalence between the security and edps gives us an idea how to distill the epr state from states that arise from the lossy and noisy channel .    in this paper",
    ", we study the unconditional security of the b92 protocol .",
    "we assume that alice has a perfect single photon source , bob s polarization measurement is perfect and he has a perfect single photon counter that discriminates between single photon states on one hand and vacuum state or multi - photon states on the other hand . under these assumptions ,",
    "we show the unconditional security of the b92 protocol .",
    "the proof follows the idea in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ review ] , we propose the protocol based on edp with local filtering and css codes @xcite , and we reduce this to the b92 protocol . in sec .",
    "[ estimation ] we give the formula for the error estimations for edp based on css code . finally , in sec .  [ conclusion ] we give the examples of the resulting performance , and the summary and discussion follow .",
    "in this section , we introduce the protocol that will turn out to be secure and will reduce to the b92 protocol . in this protocol , alice first prepares a two - qubit nonmaximally entangled states that can be written as @xmath0 and sends system b to bob .",
    "here @xmath1 , ( @xmath2 ) , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is a basis ( @xmath6-basis ) of the qubit .",
    "@xmath6-basis and @xmath7-basis is related through the relationship as @xmath8/\\sqrt{2}$ ] .    after receiving the state",
    ", bob first performs the qnd measurements that can be described by the povm ( positive operator valued measure ) @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the projector onto the single photon space and `` v '' means the detection of vacuum state or multi - photon states .",
    "thanks to this qnd measurements , even if eve sends multi - photon states or vacuum state to bob , alice and bob can work only on the qubit pairs , provided that the outcome is `` s '' .",
    "we also assume that , after this measurement , if the outcome is `` s '' , bob performs the `` local filtering operation '' @xcite on qubit b , described by the kraus operator @xmath11 where @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "note that if the channel is loss - free and noiseless or eve does nothing , this operation yields the maximally entangled state ( epr state ) @xmath13 with probability @xmath14 due to the fact that the initial state is also written as @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the filtering operation with @xmath16 is optimum one in this case .",
    "when channel is lossy and noisy , or eve is present , the filtered states may include bit errors , represented by the subspace spanned by @xmath17 , and a phase error , represented by the subspace spanned by @xmath18 . in order to distill the epr pairs ,",
    "alice and bob run the edp based on css code @xcite and after this edp alice and bob measure each in the @xmath7-basis of the epr pairs so that they obtain a secure key .",
    "note that the qnd measurement followed by the filtering @xmath19 and @xmath7-basis measurement is equivalent to a measurement @xmath20 described by @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "thus @xmath26 is the same measurement as in the b92 with perfect photon detector , and @xmath20 corresponds to the generalized b92 protocol . for convenience ,",
    "let @xmath27 be the measurements described by the set of the povm elements @xmath28 .",
    "the following is the protocol that we want to be shown secure and reduce to the generalized b92 protocol .",
    "_ protocol : _ ( 1 ) alice prepares the state @xmath29 , and she sends the system b to bob over a quantum channel .",
    "( 2 ) bob performs the qnd measurement described by @xmath30 , and he publicly announces the outcome .",
    "they take notes of the outcome .",
    "( 3 ) alice and bob repeats the step ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) @xmath31 times .",
    "let @xmath32 be the number of outcomes that resulted in `` v '' .",
    "( 4 ) alice and bob discard all the pairs whose outcomes of the qnd measurement are `` v '' . by public discussion , alice and",
    "bob randomly permute the positions of the remaining @xmath33 pairs .",
    "( 5 ) for the first @xmath34 pairs ( check pairs ) , alice measures system a in the @xmath7-basis , and bob performs measurement @xmath27 on his system . by public discussion",
    ", they determine the number @xmath35 of errors in which alice found @xmath36 and bob s outcome was @xmath37 , or alice found @xmath37 with bob s outcome @xmath36 .",
    "( 6 ) for the second @xmath34 pairs ( data pairs ) , bob performs the filtering @xmath19 on each of his qubits , and announces the total number @xmath38 and the positions of the qubits that have passed the filtering .",
    "( 7 ) from @xmath39 , @xmath35 and @xmath38 , they estimate an upper bound for the number of bit errors @xmath40 , and an upper bound for the number of phase errors @xmath41 , in the @xmath38 pairs .",
    "if these bounds are too large , they abort the protocol .",
    "( 8) they run an edp that can produce @xmath42 nearly perfect epr pairs if the estimation is correct .",
    "( 9 ) alice and bob each measures the epr pairs in @xmath7-basis to obtain a shared secret key .    in the following",
    ", we will reduce our protocol to the b92 protocol . before this reduction",
    ", we should briefly mention what alice and bob do experimentally in the b92 protocol . in the b92 protocol , alice randomly prepares the single photon polarization in the state @xmath43 or @xmath44 and sends the state to bob .",
    "after receiving the state , bob performs measurement described by @xmath20 . when @xmath45 and bob detects a single photon state , this measurement effectively performs a polarization measurement on the single photon state in a basis randomly chosen from @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the case where @xmath16 and bob detects a single photon state , this measurement effectively performs a general measurement which describes the optimum unambiguous state discrimination between @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "thanks to bob s perfect detector , if the outcome of the qnd measurement is `` s '' , then bob s states are projected onto the single photon space .",
    "this projection requires two more steps in our protocol compared to the _ protocol 1 _ in @xcite .",
    "the benefit of this projection is that for the states projected onto qubit - pairs alice and bob can use the one - way edp based on css code @xcite . in the context of qkd",
    ", this edp allows alice to perform @xmath7-basis measurements immediately after she has prepared the state @xmath29 and bob to perform @xmath7-basis measurements immediately after he has performed the filtering .",
    "now bob s measurement is described by @xmath27 .",
    "since bob performs the qnd measurement before the measurement @xmath27 , his measurement is equivalent to the measurement @xmath48 . as a whole",
    ", the protocol has been reduced into the protocol where alice prepares and sends @xmath43 or @xmath44 randomly and bob performs the @xmath20 measurement .",
    "this completes the reduction of our protocol into the generalized b92 protocol over lossy and noisy quantum channel .    due to this equivalence , it is sufficient to prove the security of the protocol for the security analysis of the b92 .",
    "the most important part in the quantitative security analysis of our protocol is to estimate phase errors and bit errors in the step ( 7 ) .",
    "if this estimation is not exponentially reliable , then in the protocol alice and bob can not distill the state sufficiently close to epr state so that the protocol is not secure @xcite . in the next section , we will give the formula to estimate the bit errors and phase errors .",
    "in this section , we consider the error estimations in the step ( 7 ) of the protocol .",
    "thanks to bob s perfect detector , the filtered states are qubit states , which allows us to directly apply some inequalities from @xcite .",
    "first , note that bit errors @xmath40 in the data pairs could be determined if alice measures those pairs in @xmath7-basis , bob performs measurement @xmath27 onto those pairs , and they compare their results .",
    "thus , the bit error rate @xmath35 in the check pairs and bit errors @xmath40 in the data pairs are determined by the same measurements .",
    "furthermore thanks to the random permutation in step ( 4 ) , we can apply the classical probability estimation so that we obtain @xmath49 for any strategy by eve , the probability of violating this inequality is asymptotically less than @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "since the povm elements that give the bit error rate on the filtered states @xmath51 and phase error rate on the filtered states @xmath52 do not commute @xcite , the classical probability argument can not be applied to the estimation of the phase errors from the bit errors . for",
    "the estimation , let us perform the gedanken measurements in the @xmath53 basis @xmath54 , and let the numbers @xmath55 of the pairs found in the state @xmath53 .",
    "here we define @xmath56 as the outcome where alice obtains the bit value @xmath57 and bob obtains vacuum or multi - photon states . as far as we consider the measurement outcomes of the povm elements that are diagonal with respect to @xmath53 basis , we are allowed to apply the classical argument for the estimation .",
    "thus , we have the following inequalities , @xmath58 which are violated with probability asymptotically less than @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] , respectively . similarly , since neither the noisy channel nor eve can touch the qubits held by alice , we have @xmath61 with probability of violation asymptotically less than @xmath62 .    in order to represent the bit error in the check pairs in terms of gedanken measurements , we introduce the global gedanken measurements in the basis @xmath63 @xmath64 and the number of the corresponding measurement outcomes @xmath65 , where @xmath66 . here",
    "the summation is taken modulo 2 .",
    "since the povm element for the bit error is diagonal with respect to the @xmath63 basis @xcite , we have @xmath67 which is violated with probability asymptotically less than @xmath68",
    ".    since @xmath69 and @xmath70 span the same subspace , we can relate @xmath71 and @xmath72 by the classical probability estimate as @xmath73 which is violated with probability asymptotically less than @xmath74 $ ] . for the estimate of the phase error rate in the data qubit from the bit error rate in the check qubit",
    ", we need to relate @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "this relation can not be obtained by classical arguments , since @xmath77 and @xmath78 are nonorthogonal . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider the qubits that are invariant under the random permutation in the limit of large number .",
    "then they showed that when we consider the measurement outcomes onto such qubits , we are allowed to regard the qubits as if they arose from the independently and identically distributed quantum source . their argument can be directly applied to our case , since in step ( 4 ) of the protocol we have also applied the random permutation .",
    "thus , we can make use of the exponentially reliable inequality derived in @xcite as @xmath79 for @xmath80 , where all the angles are defined in @xmath81 $ ] by the relations @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .    the eqs .",
    "( [ ineq1])([lastineq ] ) , together with the relation @xmath87 and @xmath88 can be used to derive the formula for the estimation of the phase error from bit error . in the following we set @xmath89 , @xmath90 by taking the limit @xmath91 so that eqs .",
    "( [ ineq1])([ineq6 ] ) are now linear equations .",
    "we first consider the special case for the b92 where bit error rate in the filtered qubits is zero while the phase error rate in the qubits is not zero .",
    "eve can accomplish this by using channel loss . from @xmath92 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath93 , one can easily find that for @xmath94 @xmath95 the limiting loss rate @xmath96 coincides with the case where eve employs optimum unambiguous state discrimination measurement @xcite . in this attack ,",
    "if she obtains the conclusive outcome , then she sends the corresponding state to bob , otherwise she does not .",
    "next we consider the general case .",
    "the relationship can be obtained by solving the equations that we have mentioned just above .",
    "after straight forward calculations , we find the implicit constraint @xmath97 where @xmath98/(\\beta^2-\\alpha^2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ x&\\equiv&\\left(\\beta^2/\\gamma^2\\right ) 2 n_{\\rm ph}/n-(\\beta^2-\\alpha^2)\\delta \\nonumber\\\\ l_0&\\equiv&\\alpha^2 n_{1{\\rm v}}/n+\\beta^2 n_{0{\\rm v}}/n \\nonumber\\\\ l_1&\\equiv&\\alpha^2 n_{0{\\rm v}}/n+\\beta^2 n_{1{\\rm v}}/n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are equal to @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively so that they must be positive .",
    "combining these positivity constraints with the positivities inside the square roots , we have @xmath103 .",
    "we can easily confirm that these equations are the same as equations in @xcite where @xmath45 and the channel has no loss i.e. , @xmath104 .",
    "( [ ineqlimit ] ) gives us the possible parameter set @xmath105 for fixed @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath39 , and @xmath38 . by taking the optimum ratio between @xmath108 and @xmath109 with respect to @xmath41 for given @xmath35 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we obtain an upper bound @xmath110 on the number of phase errors @xmath41 , as a function of the observed values @xmath35 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and the chosen parameters @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "in this section , at first we give the examples of the phase error estimation and resulting performance of the b92 protocol .",
    "to illustrate the accuracy of the phase error estimation and security performance of the b92 protocol , we assign values to the observable data as they would arise from a depolarizing quantum channel with loss , i.e. , the state @xmath111 evolves into @xmath112 $ ] , where @xmath113 is the vacuum state , @xmath39 is the loss rate of quantum channel , @xmath114 is the depolarizing rate , and @xmath115 is the pauli matrix . in fig",
    ".  [ phase ] , we show the upper bound of the estimated phase error rate , the actual phase error rate , and bit error rate for the case ( a ) @xmath116 , and ( b ) @xmath117 .",
    "these figures are independent of @xmath107 , since we plot the phase error rates normalized by @xmath38 so that the pre - factor @xmath118 is cancelled . in each figure",
    ", it is seen that when @xmath119 becomes smaller , the estimation of the phase errors becomes poorer . on the other hand , larger values of @xmath119",
    "make the signal more vulnerable to noise and loss .",
    "furthermore , due to the loss , the estimation in ( b ) is poorer than that in ( a ) , especially in the region for small @xmath119 .",
    "( dot - dashed line ) , the actual phase error rate ( solid line ) , and bit error rate ( dotted line ) in case of @xmath120 .",
    "diagram ( a ) is for @xmath121 and ( b ) is for @xmath122 .",
    "we assume that quantum channel is a depolarizing channel with loss .",
    "[ phase ] ]    since alice and bob apply random permutation in the protocol , the achievable length of the final key is given by @xmath123 $ ] @xcite , when @xmath124 . here",
    "the positivity of @xmath42 means that alice and bob generate a secure key . in fig .",
    "[ keygain ] ( a ) , we have numerically calculated the key generation rate @xmath126 in the case of @xmath45 for the fixed value of @xmath119 , @xmath39 and @xmath114 , and plot @xmath127 optimized over @xmath119 as a function of @xmath114 .",
    "the optimum value of @xmath119 is shown in fig .  [ keygain ] ( b ) .",
    "since the optimization of the ratio between @xmath108 and @xmath109 is complicated , we have optimized the ratio numerically . from fig .",
    "[ keygain ] ( a ) , it is seen that the b92 protocol as described here is secure up to @xmath128 ( in the case of @xmath121 ) , @xmath129 ( in the case of @xmath130 ) , and @xmath131 ( in the case of @xmath122 ) . the use of the general b92 measurement , i.e. , @xmath16 yields the higher secret key gain , however this does not change the cutoff of the gain nor the optimum angle in fig .",
    "[ keygain ] ( b ) .",
    "this is again because of the fact that the cutoff is determined by the error rate normalized by @xmath38 .    in the bb84 protocol or 6-state protocol @xcite ,",
    "thanks to the randomly chosen conjugate bases , phase error estimation is more precise than that in the b92 protocol . the poor estimation in the b92 makes this protocol more vulnerable to eavesdropping . actually , it is known that the bb84 protocol and 6-state protocol are secure up to @xmath132 @xcite and @xmath133 @xcite corresponding to bit error rates of @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .     for the case @xmath45 and ( b ) the optimum value of @xmath119 . here",
    "we assume that the quantum channel is the depolarizing channel with loss .",
    "the dotted line , the dot - dashed , and solid line represent the case where @xmath121 , @xmath130 , and @xmath122 respectively .",
    "[ keygain ] ]    in summary , we have shown that the security proof of the b92 over loss - free channel @xcite can be adapted to lossy and noisy channels assuming bob s detector that discriminates between single photon states on one hand and vacuum state or multi - photon states on the other hand .",
    "we have derived the general formula for the estimation of the phase errors from bit errors .",
    "we have also shown that the boundary loss rate at which eve can induce phase errors freely without inducing bit errors coincides with the case where eve employs the optimum unambiguous state discrimination measurement .",
    "finally , we have shown the examples of the security assuming the quantum channel is the depolarizing quantum channel with loss .",
    "it is an interesting problem to compare our results to the case where eve performs only individual attack . for the b92 with loss",
    ", the security is estimated in @xcite .",
    "however in that paper , it is assumed that alice and bob employ error discarding protocol so that we can not compare our result to their result directly .",
    "we leave this problem for future studies .",
    "another interesting problem is to consider the case where bob s detector is not perfect . in this case",
    ", some filtered states may remain vacuum state or multi - photon states so that our proof can not be directly applied .",
    "the security analysis of the b92 with coherent state is another interesting problem .",
