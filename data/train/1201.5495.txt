    "various classes of infinite but finitely presented structures received a lot of attention in algorithmic model theory @xcite . among the most important such classes of structures",
    "is the class of _ string - automatic structures _",
    "a ( relational ) structure is string - automatic if its universe is a regular set of words and all relations can be recognized by synchronous multi - tape automata . during the past 15 years",
    "a theory of string - automatic structures has emerged .",
    "this theory was developed along two interrelated branches .",
    "the first is a structural branch , which leads to ( partial ) characterizations of particular classes of string - automatic structures @xcite .",
    "the second is an algorithmic branch , which leads to numerous decidability and undecidability , as well as complexity results for important algorithmic problems for string - automatic structures @xcite .",
    "one of the most fundamental results for string - automatic structures states that their first - order theories are uniformly decidable @xcite .    by replacing strings and string automata by trees and tree automata , respectively , blumensath @xcite generalized string - automatic structures to _ tree - automatic structures _ and proved that their first - order theories are still uniformly decidable .",
    "however compared to string - automatic structures , the theory of tree - automatic structures is less developed .",
    "the only non - trivial characterization of a class of tree - automatic structures we are aware of concerns ordinals . in @xcite delhomm proved that an ordinal is tree - automatic if and only if it is strictly below @xmath2 .",
    "some complexity results for first - order theories of tree - automatic structures are shown in @xcite .",
    "recently , huschenbett proved that it is decidable whether a given tree - automatic scattered linear order is string - automatic @xcite .    in this paper , we study tree - automatic well - founded trees .",
    "we stress here that in this paper the term _ tree _ always refers to order trees @xmath4 ,",
    "i.e. , partial orders that have the shape of a tree , as opposed to successor trees where the edge relation is not transitive ( except for trivial cases ) . using delhomm s decomposition technique for tree - automatic structures @xcite , we show that the rank of a tree - automatic well - founded tree is strictly below @xmath1 . as a generalization of trees",
    ", we introduce the class of upwards linear partial orders",
    ". these are orders where the elements above any fixed element form a linear suborder .",
    "if such an order is well - founded and tree - automatic , then its rank is strictly below @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know if this bound holds for all tree - automatic well - founded partial orders",
    ". we will show in example [ exa : boxdestroysranksofwfpo ] that there is no hope to extend delhomm s technique in order to obtain bounds on the ranks of all tree - automatic well - founded partial orders .",
    "thus , characterizing the ranks of well - founded partial orders requires the development of completely new techniques .",
    "we apply this result to the isomorphism problem for tree - automatic well - founded trees . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the isomorphism problem for string - automatic well - founded trees is complete for level @xmath5 of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy .",
    "in other words , the isomorphism problem for string - automatic well - founded trees is recursively equivalent to true arithmetic .",
    "we show that the rank of well - founded computable trees determines the complexity of the isomorphism problem in the following sense : the isomorphism problem for well - founded computable trees of rank at most @xmath6 ( where @xmath6 is a computable limit ordinal ) belongs to level @xmath7 of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy .",
    "since we know that the rank of a tree - automatic well - founded tree is strictly below @xmath1 , this implies that the isomorphism problem for tree - automatic well - founded trees belongs to level @xmath3 of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy .",
    "we also provide a corresponding lower bound .",
    "we prove that the isomorphism problem for tree - automatic well - founded trees is @xmath3-complete under turing - reductions .",
    "let us remark that for non - well - founded order trees , the isomorphism problem is complete for @xmath8 ( the first existential level of the analytical hierarchy ) already in the string - automatic case @xcite , and this complexity is in a certain sense maximal , since the isomorphism problem for the class of all computable structures is @xmath8-complete as well @xcite .",
