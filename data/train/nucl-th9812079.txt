    "qcd has acquired significant experimental support as the correct fundamental theory of the strong interaction .",
    "however in the low energy region , its nonperturbative nature makes it hard to use directly for the study of complicated systems such as hadron interactions and exotic quark states .",
    "qcd inspired models are generally used in these cases .",
    "meson exchange models@xmath2 , on the other hand , are quite successful in explaining the hadron interactions .",
    "but since the quark and gluon degree of freedom are completely integrated out and many phenomenological coupling constants and short - range phenomenology are involved in this model , it is hard to use it to make predictions of the properties of exotic quark states .",
    "hybrid meson - gluon exchange quark cluster models have been developed by few groups@xmath3 and have achieved a quantitative fit to the scattering data that accounts well for nucleon - baryon interactions@xmath4 .",
    "however , in ref.@xcite baryons are assumed to be so stiff that no internal distortion would be induced , no matter how close the interacting baryons are .",
    "the hamiltonian used is a direct extension of that used in single hadrons .",
    "it is possible that some physics has been precluded by these assumptions a priori .",
    "for example , the qcd vacuum in between baryons can be expected to vary as the quark matter density increases as two colliding baryons approach each other and quark percolation between hadrons may occur at short distances . on the other hand ,",
    "the color confinement interaction is screened at large distances due to excitation of quark - antiquark ( @xmath5 ) pairs , as has been shown by unquenched lattice qcd calculation@xmath6 .",
    "also , various kinds of multigluon exchange interactions can not be included in two body confinement or the fermi - breit form for the interaction ; nor can they be studied in the pure valence quark model of single hadrons .",
    "an example of such a three gluon exchange interaction , which is impossible for a @xmath5 meson and does not contribute within a colorless @xmath7 baryon but does contribute to hadron - hadron interactions and to multiquark states , has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "recently , the proposed @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) dibaryon has been studied by faessler s group@xmath10 , who concluded that both bag and hybrid meson - gluon exchange models can not obtain such a state with a mass as low as 2.06gev . if the @xmath8 is proven to exist , that will argue strongly against the completeness of these models .",
    "moreover , some well established facts are either impossible or hard to address within either the meson exchange or the hybrid meson - gluon exchange model approaches . for example ,",
    "nuclear and molecular forces have been known to be similar for more than half a century@xmath11 .",
    "if the nuclear intermediate range attraction is due to meson exchange , then the similarity would be accidental because the molecular force certainly can not be due to electron - positron pair exchange .",
    "the nucleus as a collection of nucleons which has been proven to be a good approximation through the nuclear structure studies , which leaves a question as to why nucleus is not simply a collection of quarks .",
    "a different approach has been developed by our group , which we call the quark delocalization , color screening model ( qdcsm)@xmath12 . it is aimed at including more of the physics needed for the study of exotic quark states . with",
    "the lessons@xmath13 learned in earlier studies of such states in mind , we first tested our model on n - n scattering data@xmath14 .",
    "we found that the qdcsm is able to produce both the n - n short range repulsion and intermediate range attraction simultaneously without invoking meson exchange .",
    "the similarity between nuclear and molecular forces thus obtains a natural explanation , i.e. , the intermediate range attraction is due to distortion of the internal structure of the constituent nucleons ( and atoms , respectively ) .",
    "nuclear collections of 6@xmath15 , 9@xmath15 and 12@xmath15 systems can be shown to be energetically favored when they have structures organized into something close to the conventional form of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , a 6@xmath15 system with @xmath20 quantum numbers is energetically favored to be in a six quark state , @xmath21 , instead of two @xmath22s .",
    "this state is predicted to be a narrow resonance with width of order mev@xmath23 .",
    "only very limited experimental data is available for nucleon - hyperon ( n - y ) scattering .",
    "nevertheless it provides a further check of hadron interaction models . here",
    "we report the results of applying the qdcsm to n - y scattering .",
    "we should emphasize immediately that we are not so ambitious as to expect to achieve a quantitative fit to all nucleon - hyperon scattering with an almost parameter free model ; more modestly , we only seek to test further whether the qdcsm contains basically the right physics .",
    "we present a two baryon system as an example to illustrate the qdcsm . the generator coordinate method ( gcm )",

    "( a similar inclusion occurs in models such as the `` flip - flop '' model .",
    "@xmath62 ) in this sense , we are extending an effective matrix element method from bound states to scattering states .",
    "a good feature of this model hamiltonian is that it reduces to the usual non - screening , color - confinement model hamiltonian for a single hadron and for two hadrons in the asymptotic region but the spurious color van der waals force have been eliminated .",
    "the historical triumphs of the constituent quark model in explaining hadron spectroscopy are retained and the model parameters @xmath63 ( @xmath37 quark mass ) , @xmath64 ( quark - gluon coupling constant ) , @xmath65 ( strength of the confinement potential ) and @xmath41 ( baryon size parameter ) can be determined by the nucleon mass , @xmath66 mass splitting , and the stability condition for nucleon size , @xmath67 , along with the usual choice , @xmath68 . the @xmath38 quark mass ( @xmath69 ) is most accurately determined by the difference of @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses .",
    "the color screening constant @xmath70 is directly taken from lattice qcd results@xmath6 and this is the reason for our having chosen a linear confinement and exponential color screening in this calculation even though quadratic confinement may be more proper for a nonrelativistic model@xmath14 .",
    "the parameters fixed in this way are : @xmath71 note that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses calculated are 1025 mev and 1103 mev , 90 mev lower than experimental values .",
    "due to delocalization , our gcm basis wf , eq.([eq1 ] ) , includes not only the usual @xmath7-@xmath7 clustering , but also @xmath72-@xmath15 and @xmath73-@xmath74 clustering , and therefore can not be factorized into internal , relative and center of mass wf in the interaction region .",
    "the usual cluster model method has to be extended@xmath75 .",
    "suppose @xmath76 is a solution of our model hamiltonian eq.([eq4 ] ) , @xmath77    in general , both local and nonlocal interactions are included in @xmath78 , but the nonlocal interaction is nonzero only within a limited interaction region @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is roughly determined by the scale at which the overlap of different orbitals , eqs.([eq3c ] ) and ( [ eq3d ] ) , becomes negligible , and @xmath81 refers here to the separation between two three - quark clusters ( see eq.([eq16 ] ) below ) .",

    "our variational method has been checked with fujiwara s numerical results@xmath4 as well .",
    "initially , we carried out a unified , parameter free ( i.e. , all parameters are determined by single hadron properties and the color screening constant is taken from lattice qcd , ) model calculation of the n - n , n-@xmath0 and n-@xmath1 interactions .",
    "this was done to check whether the quarks delocalize reasonably in the different flavor channels to give rise to qualitatively correct",
    "n - n , n-@xmath0 and n-@xmath1 effective interactions .",
    "these effective interactions are shown in figs.13 ( @xmath149 ) and indeed qualitatively reproduce the phenomenological results .",
    "that is , the intermediate range attractions , usually assumed to be due to meson exchange , are reproduced by the quark delocalization in the qdcsm . in the n - n channels ,",
    "this model even gives rise to semi - quantitatively correct effective interactions ; figs.4 - 5 show the @xmath150 and @xmath151 n - n phase shift fits .",
    "@xcite    figs.2 - 3 shows the results for @xmath152-@xmath1 and @xmath152-@xmath0 channels . for @xmath152-@xmath0 ,",
    "the spin triplet state is somewhat more attractive than the spin singlet ; channel coupling adds a bit more attraction to this state but leaves the spin singlet almost unchanged .",
    "we note that @xmath153h and @xmath153he both have spin zero ground states and spin one excited states .",
    "one might interpret this as evidence that the spin - singlet @xmath152-@xmath0 interaction is more attractive than the spin triplet .",
    "however , the situation is not so transparent due to the complications of the interactions of the four bodies involved and , in addition , @xmath0-@xmath154 mixing effects .",
    "the spin one ground state of the deuteron is certainly an indication that the spin triplet @xmath152-@xmath152 interaction is more attractive than the spin triplet , and we might reasonably expect ( by flavor symmetry ) that this should hold true for all octet - baryon combinations .",
    "however , due to the strong tensor interaction from pion exchange , the nijmegen obe model f  @xcite nonetheless includes a more attractive spin singlet @xmath152-@xmath152 central interaction .",
    "furthermore , there is a paucity of direct data on scattering in the @xmath155-@xmath152 channels , and widely differing relative strengths for the central interaction are all consistent with both the available data and the nuclear states referred to above .",
    "the qdcsm , on the other hand , predicts that spin triplet @xmath152-@xmath152 and @xmath152-@xmath0 interactions are stronger than spin singlet ones .",
    "clearly , which central interaction is stronger in each case merits additional study .    for @xmath152-@xmath1",
    ", we find the strongest attraction in the @xmath156 channel , while the @xmath157 , and @xmath158 channels both have a little weaker attraction ( single channel case ) , and the @xmath159 channel is repulsive .",
    "channel coupling has little effect on @xmath160 , and pushes @xmath158 from attractive to repulsive .",
    "these show that the @xmath152-@xmath1 potential is more strongly spin and/or isospin dependent than the @xmath152-@xmath0 potentials , which have a little weaker dependence on spin .",
    "these results are in qualtitative agreement with the calculations of obe models  @xcite and hybrid quark model calculations  @xcite , except that our attraction for the @xmath152-@xmath1(@xmath160 ) channel is too strong .    to check if one can obtain a semi - quantitative fit of n-@xmath0 and n-@xmath1 scattering by fine tuning of the model parameters , two kinds of adjustment of the color screening parameter , @xmath70 , have been made : the first keeps the color screening parameter @xmath70 for the @xmath37 quarks unchanged , i.e. , @xmath161@xmath162 , but allows @xmath163 for the @xmath38-quark to vary ; the second one keeps @xmath164 but allows the value of @xmath70 to vary for the n-@xmath0 and n-@xmath1 channels .",
    "figs.6 , 7 and 8 show phase shifts for the n@xmath165 and n@xmath166 and @xmath167 channels with @xmath168 .",
    "these are similar , but not identical to other hybrid quark model results@xmath169 .",
    "figs.9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 show integral and differential scattering cross sections  @xcite for n@xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "a qualitative fit is obtained even though our model phase shifts differ from others .",
    "this feature occurs in the meson exchange model as well ; the nijmegen models d and f  @xcite also have quite different phase shifts from each other .",
    "quantitatively , the n-@xmath0 total cross section is fit quite well .",
    "@xcite we have shown that channel coupling does not change the n-@xmath0 interaction very much ; therefore , this good fit will be maintained even after n-@xmath0 and n-@xmath1 channel couplings are taken into account .",
    "the p-@xmath172 cross section found in the model is larger than the experimental value  @xcite and this channel does not couple to any others .",
    "hence , some fine - tuning may be needed .",
    "conversely , the p-@xmath173 cross section found in the model is smaller than the experimental value .",
    "@xcite for that case , a channel coupling calculation is needed to determine if the fit can be improved by strong channel coupling effects .",
    "the qdcsm has been used to calculate the effective",
    "n - n , n-@xmath0 and n-@xmath1 interactions .",
    "linear confinement , with a color screening constant taking from lattice qcd , has been used in this calculation .",
    "all other model parameters are determined from the properties of baryons .",
    "this means that we have a parameter - free model calculation for nucleon - baryon ( n - b ) interations .",
    "we find that the quarks delocalize reasonably in the different flavor channels ( 10 altogether ) to induce qualitatively correct , effective n - b interactions except that the n-@xmath0 ( 1/2,1 ) and n-@xmath1 ( 1/2,1 ) channels have attractions that are somewhat too strong .",
    "for the n - n channels , this model even gives semi - quantitatively correct phase shifts in the @xmath174 , and @xmath175 partial waves .",
    "after fine tuning the color screening constant , we find it also gives semi - quantitatively correct scattering cross sections for the n-@xmath0 and n-@xmath1 channels .",
    "so far , only single channel dynamical calculations have been done .",
    "the effect of dynamical channel coupling must be checked , especially for the n-@xmath1 channel . *",
    "only central interactions have been included in this calculation .",
    "non - central interactions need to be studied and higher partial wave scattering should be checked correspondingly .",
    ". a better fit of the existing n - b scattering data better would support the qdcsm , but achieving such an improvement is not be the primary goal of this model calculation .",
    "in fact , nucleon - hyperon scattering data is so sparse that different meson exchange models fit the data perfectly well , and hybrid quark models can be made to fit the data as well , if one is willing to fine tune as has been done for meson exchange models .",
    "since the fundamental strong interaction theory is certainly qcd , the n - b interactions should be an excellent area in which to study non - perturbative qcd .",
    "meson - baryon and quark - gluon descriptions both are able to describe the n - b interactions if we are willing to include the whole hierachy of meson and baryon excited states and the totality of quark - gluon interaction diagrams@xmath176 .",
    "however , we may well ask which one is the most economical approach for including major non - perturbative qcd effects and for paving the way to new strong interaction physics such as exotic quark - gluon states , strangelets and so on . that the qdcsm obtains a qualitative , and in some cases , even a semi - quantitative , fit to n - b scattering and few nucleon systems@xmath14 in its very naive version , might be an indication that it includes a substantial component of the true physics .",
    "the qcd basis of its model hamiltonian needs to be studied further . *",
    "nucleon spin structure studies show that the pure valence constituent quark model is only a first approximation .",
    "however , quark - antiquark excitation fock components are certainly present in the ground state of the nucleon@xmath177 .",
    "this fact should be taken into account in any quark model approach to hadron structure and hadron interaction studies ; the qdcsm also needs to be elaborated to include it .",
