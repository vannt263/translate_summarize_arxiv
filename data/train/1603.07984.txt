    "cyber - physical systems ( cpss ) represent the integration of computation , networking , and physical processes that are expected to play a major role in the design and development of future engineering systems equipped with improved capabilities ranging from autonomy to reliability and cyber security , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the use of communication infrastructures and heterogeneous it components have certainly improved scalability and functionality features in several applications ( transportation systems , medical technologies , water distributions , smart grids and so on ) , but on the other hand they have made such systems highly vulnerable to cyber threats , see e.g. the attack on the network power transmission @xcite or the stuxnet warm which infects the supervision control and data acquisition system used to regulate uranium enrichments @xcite . recently",
    ", the analysis of the cps security from a theoretic perspective has received increasing attention and different solutions to discover cyber attack occurrences have been proposed , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and reference therein for detailed discussions .",
    "first , it is important to underline that if the attacker and defender share the same information then a passive anomaly detection system has no chance to identify stealthy attacks @xcite .",
    "there , the authors propose the introduction of an artificial time - varying model correlated to the cps dynamics so that any adversary attempting to manipulate the system state is revealed through its effect on such an extraneous time - varying system .    along these lines ,",
    "a relevant approach is provided in @xcite where the physical watermarking concept is exploited .",
    "specifically , a noisy control signal is superimposed to a given optimal control input in order to authenticate the physical dynamics of the system . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors modify the system structure in order to reveal zero dynamic attacks , while in @xcite a coding sensor outputs is considered to detect fdi attacks .",
    "it is worth to point out that most of works addressing cpss focus their attention only on the detection problem leaving out the control countermeasures . to the best of the author",
    "s knowledge very few control remediation strategies against cyber attacks have been proposed , see e.g. @xcite where a first contribution for dealing with cps affected by corrupted sensors and actuators has been presented .    in this paper",
    "two classes of cyber attacks will be analyzed : i ) _ partial model knowledge attacks _ and ii ) _ full model knowledge attacks _ @xcite .",
    "the former is capable to break encryption algorithms which protect the communication channels and to modify the signals sent to the actuators and to the controller with the aim to cause physical damages .",
    "the second class can inject malicious data within the control architecture .",
    "zero - dynamics and fdi attacks fall into such a category @xcite . in the sequel ,",
    "the main aim is to develop a control architecture capable to manage constrained cpss subject to malicious data attacks .",
    "as one of its main merits , the strategy is able to combine into a unique framework detection / mitigation tasks with control purposes .",
    "in fact both the detection and control phases are addressed by using the watermarking approach and the set - theoretic paradigm firstly introduced in @xcite and then successfully applied in e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ specifically , the identification module can be viewed as an active detector that , differently from the existing solutions , does not require neither input or model manipulations . moreover , a watermarking like behavior can be simply obtained during the on - line computation of the control action . the attack mitigation is achieved by exploiting the concept of one - step controllable set jointly with cyber actions ( communication disconnection , channels re - encryption ) in order to ensure guaranteed control actions under any admissible attack scenario .",
    "+ finally , a simulations campaign is provided under several attack scenarios to prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology .",
    "let us consider the class of networked constrained cyber - physical system ( * nc - cps * ) described by the following discrete - time lti model where we assume w.l.o.g .",
    "that the state vector is fully available : @xmath0 where @xmath1 @xmath2 denotes the plant state , @xmath3 the control input , @xmath4 the output state measure and @xmath5 exogenous bounded plant and measure disturbances , respectively . moreover",
    "( [ eq : sys ] ) is subject to the following state and input set - membership constraints : @xmath6    [ ubb ] let @xmath7 be a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "the closed - loop trajectory of ( [ eq : sys])-([eq : constraints ] ) is said to be uniformly ultimate boundedness ( uub ) in @xmath7 if for all @xmath8 there exists @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that , for every @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13    [ definition : one - step - controllable - sets ] a set @xmath14 is robustly positively invariant ( rpi ) for ( [ eq : sys])-([eq : constraints ] ) if there exists a control law @xmath10 such that , once the closed - loop solution @xmath15 enters inside that set at any given time @xmath16 , it remains in it for all future instants , i.e. @xmath17 @xmath18    given the sets @xmath19 @xmath20 is the _ minkowski set sum _ and @xmath21 the _ minkowski set difference_. @xmath18      in the sequel , the receding horizon control scheme proposed in @xcite and based on the philosophy developed in the seminal paper @xcite is summarized .",

[",
    "remark : varaible_cost_function ] it is worth noticing that the cost function @xmath40 can be arbitrarily chosen without compromising the final objective of the control strategy and , in principle , it may be changed at each time instant .",
    "in the sequel , we consider cpss whose physical plant is modeled as ( [ eq : sys])-([eq : constraints ] ) , while the controller is spatially distributed and a cyber median is used to build virtual communication channels from the plant to the controller and _ vice - versa _ , see fig . [",
    "fig : distribuited_control_architecture ] .",
    "we assume that _ sensors - to - controller _ and _ controller - to - actuators _ communications are executed via internet by means of encrypted sockets while all the remaining channels are local and externally not accessible .",
    "moreover , malicious agents have the possibility to attack the communication over internet by breaking the protocol security and may compromise / alter data flows in both the communication channels .",
    "within such a context , two classes of attacks will be taken into account : _ a ) _ denials of service ( dos ) and _ b ) _ false data injections ( fdi ) : dos attacks prescribe that attackers prevent the standard sensor and controller data flows , while fdi occurrences give rise to arbitrary data injection on the relevant system signals , i.e. command inputs and state measurements .",
    "+ specifically , we shall model attacks on the actuators as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the command input determined by the controller , @xmath44 the attacker perturbation and @xmath45 the resulting corrupted signal .",
    "similarly , sensor attacks has the following structure : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the attacker signal and @xmath48 the resulting corrupted measurement .",
    "from now on , the following assumptions are made :    [ ass1 ] _ an encrypted socked between controller and plant can be on - demand reestablished in at most @xmath49 time instants .",
    "_    [ ass2 ] _ the minimum amount of time @xmath50 required to violate the cryptography algorithm is not vanishing , i.e @xmath51 _    [ ass3 ] _",
    "no relevant channel delays are due to the communication medium , i.e. all the induced delays are less than the sampling time @xmath52 _    [ remark : assumptions ] _ assumption _ [ ass2 ] relies on the fact that communication channels are not compromised for at least @xmath49 time instants downline of a new encrypted socked is established . as a consequence , the plant - controller structure",
    "is guaranteed w.r.t the sensor / actuator data truthfulness .",
    "@xmath18    then , the problem we want to solve can be stated as follows : + * resilient control problem of nc - cpss subject to cyber attacks ( * rc - nc - cps * ) * -    _ consider the control architecture of fig .",
    "[ fig : distribuited_control_architecture ] . given the * nc - cps * model ( [ eq : sys])-([eq : constraints ] ) subject to dos and/or fdi ( [ acutator_attack_model])-([sensor_attack_model ] ) attacks ,",

    "moreover , if @xmath55 ( attack free scenario ) and @xmath56 ( disturbance free scenario ) @xmath57 then the regulated plant is asymptotically stable .",
    "the * rc - nc - cps * problem will be addressed by properly customizing the dual model set - theoretic control scheme described in section [ section : dual - mode ] .",
    "in this section , an identification attack module will be developed . to this end , the following preliminaries are necessary .",
    "first , notice that according to ( [ fun_opt_b_3])-([cond_opt_b_5 ] ) the following set - membership conditions hold true : @xmath58 with @xmath59 the expected output prediction set .",
    "then , by using the classification given in @xcite , we consider attackers having the following disclosure and disrupt resources :    * _ disclosure _ : an attacker can access to the command inputs @xmath34 and to the sensor measures @xmath60 * _ disrupt _ : an attacker can inject arbitrary vectors @xmath61 , @xmath62 on the actuator and sensor communication channels but it can not read and write on the same channel in a single time interval .",
    "finally , we consider attacks belonging to the following categories :    [ def : stealthy - attack ] let us denote with @xmath63 and @xmath64 the attacker model knowledge and expected output prediction set , respectively , then an _ attack with full model knowledge _ is an attack with full information , @xmath65 about the closed - loop dynamics of the physical plant , @xmath66 and perfect understanding of the expected output set , @xmath67    [ def : no - stealthy - attack ] an _ attack with partial model knowledge _ is an attack with partial information , @xmath63 , about the closed - loop dynamics of ( [ eq : sys ] ) , e.g. @xmath68      the next result proposition shows that such attacks can not compromise the system integrity while remaining stealthy .",

    "otherwise when ( ii ) takes place , the following arguments are exploited .",
    "first , an attacker could modify the control signal by adding a malicious data @xmath61 and , simultaneously , the detection can be avoided by infecting the effective measurement @xmath79 as follows : @xmath80 because the set @xmath81 is unknown ( see _ definition _ [ def : no - stealthy - attack ] ) such a reasoning is not feasible .",
    "a second possible scenario could consist in injecting small sized perturbations @xmath61 and @xmath82 such that @xmath83 clearly , in this case by construction the computed command @xmath84 remains feasible",
    ".      a simple stealthy attack can be achieved by means of the following steps :    _ _    * stealthy attack algorithm *    * knowledge : * @xmath85    acquire @xmath86 [ primo_step_stealthy ] estimate the control action @xmath87 by emulating the optimization ( [ fun_opt_b_3])-([cond_opt_b_5 ] ) ; compute the expected disturbance - free one - step ahead state measurement @xmath88 corrupt @xmath73 with an arbitrary malicious admissible signal @xmath61 such that @xmath89 corrupt the output vector @xmath90 , according to expected one - step state evolution @xmath91 i.e. @xmath92 @xmath93 , goto step [ primo_step_stealthy ]    note that the above attack can never be identified by the proposed detector @xmath53 because condition ( [ eq : condition_attack ] ) is always satisfied . as a consequence , the only way to detect it is to increase the information available at the defender side @xmath85 so that the _ partial model knowledge_attack structure is re - considered : @xmath94 the key idea traces the philosophy behind the watermarking approach @xcite , where the defender superimposes a noise control signal ( new information not available at the defender side ) in order to authenticate the physical dynamics .",
