    "the underlying physics behind the doped mott insulators is essential to elucidate the mechanism that leads to the high temperature superconductivity .",
    "the major challenge is to explain , microscopically , how an antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulator evolves into a superconductor@xcite . in this sense ,",
    "angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is one of the most refined experiments that gives access to the one particle excitations of doped mott insulators@xcite .",
    "although the photoemission spectra of the cuprates have been well characterized by arpes experiments as a function of doping , there is still no consensus about the theoretical description of the multiple features observed .",
    "even the most simple case , that is , the dynamics of a hole injected in an antiferromagnetic matrix , remains still largely unsolved .",
    "in particular , the main disagreement is that in most of the theoretical calculations based on the @xmath0 model the low energy excitations corresponds to quasiparticle excitations@xcite , while in the arpes spectra the width of the low energy peaks is so large that they can not be associated with a physical lifetime of quasiparticles@xcite .",
    "in addition to this controversy observed in the cuprates , there has been an increasing interest in the study of the hole motion in different antiferromagnetic backgrounds in order to test the validity of the coherent quasiparticle or spin polaron picture .",
    "for the unfrustrated @xmath3 nel order it has been shown , numerically and analytically@xcite , that the quasiparticle excitations exist for all momenta and for all @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , in a highly frustrated case like the kagom lattice , which is believed to be magnetically disordered , completely incoherent spectral functions have been found@xcite for all momenta , @xmath5 , and both @xmath6 signs  it should be noted that in the square lattice unfrustrated case the particle - hole symmetry leads to the same behavior for both signs of @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , we have recently found@xcite that in the triangular antiferromagnet , with a @xmath7 nel order , an intermediate situation between the square and the kagom geometries arises , since the quasiparticle weight only vanishes for @xmath8 .",
    "this result is particularly interesting because it means that the conventional quasiparticle picture can be broken in a semiclassical magnetic background , without invoking spin liquid phases .",
    "besides the mechanism of hole motion assisted by spin fluctuations , already existing in the unfrustrated case , in the triangular antiferromagnet there appears a free hopping hole mechanism as a direct consequence of a ferromagnetic component of the underlying magnetic structure .",
    "the latter implies a finite probability of hole motion without emission or absorption of magnons . in our previous work",
    "we have shown that it is the subtle interference between both processes for hole motion that produces the vanishing of the quasiparticle excitations@xcite .    in the present article",
    "we will study the hole dynamics in canted antiferromagnetic states where , by varying the canting angle , it is possible to consider the evolution of the magnetic background from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic state .",
    "this kind of study , little explored in the literature @xcite , allows us to investigate the spectral functions continually from the af state only spin flip assisted processes to the ferromagnetic state only free hopping process , so as to investigate more carefully how the non - trivial interference between both hole - motion processes influences the formation of a coherent quasiparticle . to carry out the study we have derived an effective hamiltonian from the @xmath0 model using the spinless fermion representation for the kinetic part , and a canted spin wave state for the magnetic part . within the self consistent born approximation we have found that , for @xmath9 , the hole propagates preferably at two well separated energies : as a coherent spin polaron excitation at low energy , and as a quasi - free hole at higher energy .",
    "we were able to associate the former energy scale to the af component , while the latter to the ferromagnetic one .",
    "as the canting angle increases we have observed an important spectral weight transfer from low to higher energy sectors leading to the reduction of the quasiparticle weight . in particular , inside the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) , the quasiparticle weight vanishes for @xmath2 . +",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the effective hamiltonian for a hole moving in a canted af . in sec .",
    "iii we briefly draw the calculation of the hole green function within the self consistent born approximation . in sec .",
    "iv we present and discuss the results for the hole spectral functions , and in sec .",
    "v we state the conclusions of our work .",
    "to study the hole motion in a canted antiferromagnet we will study the @xmath0 model in the square lattice@xcite . in order to stabilize a canted phase we add a zeeman term that couples only with the spin operators , so that we can vary the canting angle @xmath1 by tuning a _ fictitious _ uniform magnetic field @xmath10",
    "actually , such a canted phase might be a consequence of further anisotropic magnetic interactions , but the final effect on the hole dynamics will be the same .",
    "thus , we use the following @xmath0 hamiltonian    @xmath11    where the kinetic part @xmath12 represents the hopping between nearest neighbors ( @xmath13 ) of the square lattice , with the constraint of no double occupancy , @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 represents the af heisenberg part along with the zeeman term .      the magnetic part is treated in the spin wave approximation@xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the semiclassical uncanted af order lies in the @xmath16 plane while the magnetic field @xmath10 points in the @xmath17 direction .",

    "the second one represents a hopping processes magnon assisted by the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic bands , respectively . when the canting angle @xmath66 , the free hopping term vanishes and two degenerate antiferromagnetic bands are recovered .",
    "so , as it is expected for the case of hole motion in a pure af matrix , the kinetic part is only described by a hole coupled to af magnons@xcite . on the other hand , when the canting angle is such that the underlying magnetic order is ferromagnetic , @xmath67 the magnon assisted hopping disappears and the only mechanism available for hole motion is the free hopping term",
    ". therefore , it is possible to interpolate the hole motion continually between the pure af state and the ferromagnetic state , so as to investigate carefully how the non - trivial interference between both hole - motion processes influences the formation of a coherent quasiparticle .",

    "[ fig2 ] it is shown the spectra for @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we have chosen these particular momentum and coupling regime since for them , the main features of the spectra are clearly differentiated , and therefore it is easier to identify the underlying mechanisms for hole motion",
    ". the case @xmath66 ( upper panel ) corresponds to the spectral function of a hole in a pure af matrix .",
    "this result has been already obtained by one of us @xcite and others authors @xcite using the scba .",
    "the spectra extend over a frequency range @xmath95 with a low energy sector composed by a delta peak at the bottom of the spectra along with several resonances of finite lifetime above it .",
    "the former is associated with a quasiparticle excitation ( qp ) , whose bandwith is of order @xmath96 ; whereas the latter resonances can be identified with string excitations since its energies scale as @xmath97 . on the other hand",
    ", there is an incoherent part corresponding to the shoulder located at an energy @xmath98 .",
    "+     and @xmath94.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the low and high energy structure of the spectra can be traced back to the coupling between the hole and the underlying af order . _",
    "low energy sector : _ as the hole moves , with a characteristic time of order @xmath99 , the af order is locally disturbed leaving a string of overturned spins . meanwhile , the zero point spin fluctuations above the classical nel state @xmath100 , contained in the quantum af ground state @xmath101 @xcite repair pairs of frustrated spins at a characteristic time of order @xmath102 .",
    "it is clear that , in the weak coupling regime ( @xmath103 ) , the magnetic string of overturned spins can be completely erased by the zero point spin fluctuations , and the hole surrounded by an af cloud emerges as a coherent quasiparticle excitation .",
    "however , in the strong coupling regime ( @xmath9 ) , the magnetic string is only partially erased and , besides the low energy qp excitation , there are higher energy processes strings excitations corresponding to the hole inside a linear potential generated by the overturned spins .",
    "this picture has been widely confirmed by several numerical and analytical techniques@xcite . _",
    "high energy sector : _ to describe the incoherent part of the high energy sector , it is convenient to take a closer look at the zero point spin fluctuations . in particular ,",
    "if the exponential function in @xmath104 is developed in a taylor series , the quantum af ground state can be written as @xmath105 , where the fluctuations can be seen as a sum of @xmath106 conserving terms like @xmath107 . as we have stated before",
    ", these fluctuations erase part of the strings , but they also generate small ferromagnetic clusters wherein the hole can propagate freely .",
    "this explains the broad shoulder centered at @xmath108 that is , the finite probability to find the hole propagating at considerable high energies above the qp excitation .",
    "in fact , we have extended our calculation to the anisotropic heisenberg model , and we have effectively found a suppression of the shoulder as well as an enhancement of the string resonances as the ising limit is approached .",
    "+ now we discuss the evolution of the spectra with the canting angle . at @xmath109 ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , there appears a classical ferromagnetic component in the underlying magnetic order , while the zero point spin fluctuations get reduced .",
    "this adds a free hopping mechanism for the hole motion , represented by the tight binding term of eq .",
    "( [ htfinal ] ) .",
    "such an additional mechanism competes with the magnon - assisted , as well as with the incoherent hopping processes driven by the zero point spin fluctuations , resulting in a spectral weight transfer from the low energy sector and the incoherent shoulder to an energy located at @xmath110 for @xmath111 ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) most of the spectral weight is dominated by this new mechanism , signaled by a finite lifetime resonance , @xmath6-resonance , located at an energy close to @xmath112 .",
    "so that , as the canting angle increases , the probability of finding the hole moving freely along the classical ferromagnetic channel becomes more important than both , the magnon - assisted and the incoherent hopping processes driven by zero point spin fluctuations .",
    "a similar scenario of a low energy excitation coexisting with a higher energy long - lived resonance , dispersing as a free band , has been found in recent high - resolution photoemission spectra from the insulating cuprates @xmath113@xcite .",
    "while in the cuprate the appearance of the high energy part of the spectra has been ascribed to hoppings to first and further neighbors , in our present calculation the high energy part , dispersing like a free band , is obtained with the canting angle . +     and @xmath94.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the evolution of the spectral function with @xmath1 becomes more complex when the @xmath28 dependence is taken into account .",
    "in particular , for @xmath28 outside the magnetic brillouin zone the qp and string excitations start to overlap with the @xmath6-resonance at the low energy sector ( see fig [ fig3 ] ) , while for @xmath28 inside the magnetic brillouin zone something similar to @xmath93 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] occurs , namely , the peaks are quite separated . as the canting angle is increased , there is a transfer of spectral weight from the magnon assisted to the free hopping process as a consequence of the reduction of the vertex interaction with @xmath1 , @xmath114 .",
    "it is worth to stress that the low energy qp excitation has its origin in the coherent scattering between the hole and the magnons , so the reduction of the scattering rate renders the magnon - assisted hopping process less effective than the free hopping one , that is originated by the ferromagnetic component of the underlying magnetic structure .",
    "finally , for @xmath115 , the only allowed hole motion process is the free one along the completely ferromagnetic order , thus , the whole spectral function becomes a single delta peak .      in this section",
    "we analyze the quasiparticle excitations in the low energy sector of the spectra .",
    "this can be quantified by the qp weight @xmath116 that gives a measure of the overlap between the state of a bare hole created on the af background and the quasiparticle state @xmath117 . in our case",
    "we computed the qp weight using the well known relation @xmath118 .",
    "it is worth to note that the complex @xmath28 dependence of the spectral weight transfer with @xmath1 , mentioned in the previous section , is clearly manifested in the qp excitations . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] it is shown the qp weight versus @xmath1 for @xmath5 and several momenta .     for several momenta and @xmath5.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    on one hand , for @xmath28 inside the magnetic brillouin zone the effect of the canting is to monotonically decrease the qp weight until it vanishes at around @xmath119 ( see for instance , @xmath120 and @xmath121 of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . in this region",
    "the spectra is characterized by the two well separated peaks ( see @xmath122 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) where the qp excitations have a magnon assisted origin .",
    "so , the vanishing of the qp weight with @xmath1 is due to the reduction of the vertex interaction with @xmath123 on the other hand , for @xmath28 outside the magnetic brillouin zone @xmath124 and @xmath125 initially the qp weight increases with @xmath123 this is an unexpected behavior if the @xmath1 dependence of the vertex interaction is taken into account again .",
    "however , in this sector of the brillouin zone , the magnon assisted and the free hopping processes merge at the low energy sector increasing the qp weight ( see @xmath126 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this can be seen as a constructive interference between the hole motion processes in the formation of the qp . for greater angles",
    "the qp weight is dominated by the vertex interaction and goes to zero as @xmath127 . at @xmath115",
    "the magnon assisted process vanishes for all @xmath28 and the only allowed process is the free hole motion along the ferromagnetic channel , jumping @xmath128 from zero to unity .",
    "@xmath129 is a unique case where the qp weight increases monotonically to unity due to the strict energy coincidence of both hole motion processes . for this case we can say that there is always a constructive interference of the processes .",
    "it should be noted that the qp ground state momentum evolves with the canting angle along the diagonal @xmath130 , being @xmath131 the ground state momentum for @xmath1 greater than @xmath132 when @xmath5 .",
    "the advantage of using explicitly two sublattices in our calculation is the possibility to analyze separately the coupling of the hole with the ferro and af magnons .",
    "for instance , if we cancel @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) in the kinetic part ( [ htfinal ] ) , the coupling of the hole with the ferro ( af ) band is omitted . under this condition the self - consistent equations ( [ self ] ) for @xmath89 can be solved and , via the relations ( [ greenrel ] ) , it is obtained @xmath135 without the effect of the ferro or the af excitations on the hole motion .",

    "[ fig5 ] it is shown separately the ferro ( dashed line ) and the af ( dotted line ) contributions to the qp weight , along with the complete prediction ( solid line ) , for @xmath5 and @xmath122 .",
    "it is observed that the qp weight is greater for the ferromagnetic than for the af contribution .",
    "furthermore , when both magnetic bands are considered , the qp weight resembles that of the af character . this can be seen as a consequence of the different momentum dependence of the interaction vertices @xmath136 for all @xmath28 and @xmath137 , the vertex @xmath138 while @xmath139 . as stated before , since the qp excitation has a magnon assisted character driven by the vertex interaction , a stronger coupling produces an enhancement of the qp weight . so that , the coupling of the hole with the ferromagnetic band is more coherent than with the af one , and when both couplings are considered together the qp weight follows the less coherent af contribution .     for @xmath5 and @xmath122 .",

    "for this reason , when the canting angle increases , so af component of the magnetic order is reduced , the qp weight goes to zero .",
    "closely related to the qp excitations , we have found string excitations that rapidly smear out as the canting angle is increased . on the other hand , at higher energies",
    "we have found rather long - lived resonances related to the motion of the hole along the ferromagnetic component .",
    "as the ferromagnetic component increases with the canting angle , these resonances become more pronounced . even in the strong coupling regime",
    ", we were able to fit the position and the linewidth of these resonances by a conventional perturbative calculation .",
    "as the system moves to the weak coupling regime we found that the character of qp excitations undergoes a crossover from the many - body spin polaron to a free hole state weakly perturbed by magnons .",
    "we would like to emphasize that these features , obtained for the hole motion in a canted antiferromagnet , are generic and they could also be observed in other magnetic systems , where the anisotropies of the magnetic interactions lead to a canted magnetic state like dzyaloshinsky - moriya or ising anisotropies .",
