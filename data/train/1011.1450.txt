    "in the past years the emerging field of spintronics has led to the search for novel materials exhibiting ferromagnetic and semiconducting properties at the same time , since such ferromagnetic semiconductors would allow the integration of new application schemes into established semiconductor technologies .",
    "gemn seems to be a very promising candidate in the class of ferromagnetic semiconductors for its compatibility with the mainstream silicon technology .",
    "recent works consistently demonstrated the possibility of preparing gemn thin films by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) without secondary phase separation , but with the strong tendency to the formation of mn rich nanometer sized clusters.@xcite these clusters exhibit a curie temperature about or even above room - temperature ( rt ) which would be important for device applications .",
    "in an early work it was claimed that magnetic properties may be controlled through electric gating , suggesting that charge carriers mediate the magnetic exchange interactions.@xcite therefore the electrical properties in an external magnetic field , i.e. the magneto resistance ( mr ) and the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) are considered an important fingerprint of a magnetic semiconductor .",
    "however , in the same degree as there is a consistent picture of the nanostructure of gemn thin films , their fingerprint in magneto transport measurements still lacks such a coherent description in literature .",
    "for example , mr effects reaching from several thousand percent being positive@xcite to a few percent being negative@xcite have been reported . similarly",
    ", hall effect measurements sometimes yield a large contribution of the ahe on the one hand,@xcite but also a diminishing contribution washed out by the ordinary hall effect on the other.@xcite in many cases the interpretation of these results interestingly does not correlate with the sample magnetization , particularly regarding its saturation and hysteresis effects , which are often absent in transport measurements .",
    "recently it was pointed out by @xcite that part of these reports may be understood in a regime of parallel conduction of two charge carrier types , owing to the role of mn as a deep two - level acceptor in ge , without being related to the magnetic nature of gemn thin films in itself .    in this study",
    ", we would like to highlight the possibility that the peculiar transport properties observed in some gemn transport studies might not be caused by the alloying of ge with mn at all , but by parallel conduction through the employed substrates . while high purity substrates of semiconductors like si or gaas exhibit rt resistivities greater than , this is not the case for ge substrates .",

    "this suggests that neither the inhomogeneity , magnetic nature nor the presence of mn acceptors in the gemn thin film leads to the observed transport properties .",
    "we conclude that the transport properties of the gemn sample do emerge from parallel conduction through the substrate .",
    "this dominating contribution of the substrate can be understood , when one considers the system of an epitaxially fabricated gemn thin film on top of the high resistivity ge substrate as two parallel conducting resistors . for an independent determination of the transport properties of the epi - layer without contributions from the substrate layer ,",
    "the resistance of the gemn epi - layer has to be at least a factor of ten smaller than that of the substrate .",
    "a comparison of the thicknesses of these two layers implicates that the epi - layer resistivity then has to be smaller by a factor of @xmath15 than the resistivity of the ge substrate .",

    "section  [ sec : nsub ] ) , but nevertheless being non - degenerate , that would demand rt mobilities in the order of a few . however , since gemn thin films exhibit a very inhomogeneous nanostructure,@xcite such a high mobility can not be expected . in fact , mobilities of that order of magnitude are only reached in conventional p - type doped ge with similar hole concentrations , when the dopants are homogeneously diluted in the host matrix.@xcite in essence , because of the low conductivity of non - degenerate gemn thin films , one can not determine the transport properties of the gemn epi - layer in a straightforward manner , when it is fabricated on high resistivity ge substrates .      ]",
    "we now would like to address whether an electrical transport characterization of degenerately doped , p - type gemn thin films on high resistivity ge substrates , i.e. thin films with carrier concentrations clearly above , is feasible . in order to separate phenomena related to the magnetization or nanostructure from those related to parasitic conduction through the substrate , we explored degenerately doped , non - magnetic ge : b epi - layers as a model system .",
    "since b opposed to mn , is not a deep , but a shallow acceptor in ge , a doping concentration of lies well above the mott insulator - to - metal transition , and is therefore sufficiently large to deliver thin films with degenerate , metallic - like conduction properties .",
    "figure  [ fig : rho(t)_geb ] shows the temperature dependence of the resistance of the ge : b sample .",

    "approximately we observe the onset of the decrease of the zero field resistance with increasing temperature , as already depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho(t)_geb ] .",
    "however , the resistance now rises quickly with increasing magnetic field , hence giving an increased mr effect .",
    "eventually at high fields the resistance tends to saturate at the value . with increasing measurement temperature this saturation",
    "is shifted towards higher fields , while at the highest temperatures full saturation is not reached anymore within the investigated field range .    the hall effect of the ge : b sample is shown in fig .  .",
    "below we observe a linear hall effect . at temperatures of and above the field dependence",
    "drastically changes : for small field values we first observe a strong increase of the hall slope . upon increasing the field",
    ", the hall effect shows a peak - like maximum and then approaches the hall curve measured for asymptotically .    the transport behavior of the ge : b film , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho(t)_geb ] and fig .   is not in line with the metallic character of the epi - layer .",
    "we can rather identify two distinct temperature regimes with different properties below and above .",
    "similar results for the hall effect and field dependence of longitudinal resistivity which can be separated into two temperature regimes were found for the gemn material systems in degenerate thin films prepared by ion implantation.@xcite they were interpreted in terms of a two - band like conduction scheme , accounting for possible electronic ground and excited states of mn in ge.@xcite in contrast , our results in the two distinct regimes are naturally explained by assuming parallel conduction through the substrate : below parallel conduction is not present , since the substrate resistance gets very large , whereas the resistance of the metallic epi - layer does not change .",
    "assuming now that conduction only takes place in the thick ge : b epi - layer , we can extract a hole density of , in fair agreement with the nominal concentration value .",
    "furthermore the carrier mobility amounts to the relatively small value of @xmath16 . due to the general proportionality between the orbital mr and carrier mobility",
    ", the small mr effect would therefore also be in line with conduction through the metallic ge : b epi - layer .",
    "the transport measurements of the ge : b sample can undoubtedly be attributed solely to the ge : b epi - layer in the temperature regime below . for temperatures above we need to include substrate contributions for an interpretation of the magneto transport data . at low fields , conduction will mostly take place in the substrate because of its smaller resistance . at large fields , conduction through the substrate",
    "will quickly cease , because its mr gets larger .",
    "then most of the current flows through the epi - layer .",
    "thus , in the hall as well as the mr measurement , we probe the substrate properties at small magnetic field and the ge : b epi - layer properties at high field , leading to the described peaking and saturation effects .",
    "the decreasing tendency of saturation at high magnetic field with increasing measurement temperature comes from the weakening of mr of the ge substrate .",
    "the ge : b sample thus has to be regarded as a system of two conducting layers with different galvanomagnetic responses .",
    "this phenomenological interpretation is supported by a description of the magneto transport data with a two - layer conduction model .",
    "it is based on the assumption that each conducting layer can be described by its individual resistivity tensor , which reduces to a @xmath17 matrix in the case where the magnetic field is normal to the plane of carrier motion . since the two layers are not equally thick , in the following expressions we will give sheet resistivities rather than bulk resistivities to maintain generality .",
    "the resulting components of the sheet resistivity tensor of the combined two - layer system have then the form    @xmath18    the quantities with subscripts 1 and 2 correspond to the tensor components of the ge : b epi - layer and the ge substrate layer , respectively .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a semi - empirical application of the above equations for a computation of the hall and mr effect of the ge : b sample for different temperatures .",
    "the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 entering this computation are taken from measurements : the contributions @xmath21 and @xmath22 of ge : b epi - layer correspond to the measurement curves of the ge : b sample as were shown in fig .   and .",
    "we assume they do not vary with increasing temperature , which is justified by the metallic character of this epi - layer ( see also section  [ sec : nsub ] ) therefore using them for all temperatures we investigate .",

    "we also included the @xmath19 and @xmath20 contributions of the ge : b epi - layer and the substrate in the plot .",
    "there is a good agreement between the two - layer conduction model and the measurements of the ge : b sample for both , the @xmath14 and @xmath13 component .",
    "in particular the low field domination of the ge substrate layer as well as the saturation for high field at the ge : b epi - layer contribution can be reproduced well by eqs .  .",
    "thus , the model qualitatively demonstrates that parallel conduction through the substrate is also present in a sample with a degenerate , metallic , well conducting epi - layer in the extrinsic range of the underlying substrate .",
    "for the small quantitative differences between the computed and the actual experimental results , a major reason can be made out .",
    "the model eqs .   strictly apply for a two - layer system , where both layers have the same in - plane geometry .",
    "since the hall bar mesa , however , does not define such a geometry for the substrate conduction channel , differences between theory and experiment will occur .    from the results on the degenerate ge",
    ": b reference sample we infer that in the case of metallic gemn thin films deposited on the high resistivity substrate intrinsic properties of the gemn epi - layer may be directly derived in the freeze - out temperature regime of the substrate . for higher temperatures ,",
    "however , care must be taken to separate the intrinsic properties of gemn from the aforementioned effects arising due to the two - layer conduction .",
    "it was previously shown in fig .   that the high resistivity substrate of very pure ge exhibits an extremely large mr effect up to",
    ". however , reports of magneto transport properties of high purity ge show that this large effect is not expected.@xcite to study the mr effect of the high resistivity substrate further , we fabricated additional samples using a van der pauw ( vdp ) geometry , as depicted in the schematic of fig .  .",
    "interestingly , the mr effect of the vdp sample presented in figure  [ fig : mr_sub_gemn_vdp ] is now more than twenty times smaller than for the corresponding hall bar sample . evidently , the large mr effect previously obtained in hall bar geometry is not an inherent physical property of the ge substrate .",
    "the measurements taken in vdp geometry agree much better with the above mentioned magneto - transport studies of ge.@xcite    up to now we can only speculate about the reasons inducing the large mr effect .",
    "most probably it is related to a redistribution of the current lines upon applying a magnetic field , similar to the effect observed in ref .  .",
    "referring to the sample schematic depicted in fig .",
    "the relatively large , metalized voltage probes 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 have to be considered as effective short - circuits within the sample volume , if conduction through substrate is present . in a magnetic field",
    "these short - circuits may be diminished as the electric field and therefore the current flow will get tangent to these areas .",
    "the result is an artificial increase of the sample resistance .",
    "additionally the small length to width ratio of @xmath25 , basically given by the separation of contacts 1 and 5 and the width of contact 1 , may also favor a considerable hall effect induced contribution to the intrinsic mr.@xcite    ]    we also reinvestigated the gemn thin film sample in vdp geometry . upon comparing it with the ge substrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr_sub_gemn_vdp ] we now remark a pronounced difference between the mr measurement above approximately for temperatures up to .",
    "the mr of the gemn sample follows a more linear behavior , while the mr of the substrate still increases superlinearly above this field . at and",
    "higher temperatures both samples exhibit the same mr effect .",
    "we infer from this behavior that at least below transport properties of the gemn epi - layer get visible in the measurement .",
    "this may be due to the fact , that in vdp geometry the volume of the epi - layer is not restricted to the in - plane dimensions of the etched hall bar mesa , but extends over the whole chip area .",
    "therefore the effective volume ratio of the epi - layer to the substrate , hence the conductance ratio , is increased in vdp geometry compared to the hall bar geometry .",
    "we thus conclude that a vdp geometry is to be favored over a hall bar in the gemn material system with its high probability of parallel conduction through the substrate . by using a vdp geometry the comparison of experimental data with an elaborate , ab - initio two - layer conduction model , extending the scheme outlined in section  [ sec : twolayer ] , may enable a derivation of inherent transport properties of gemn thin films , in spite of the dominant contribution of the ge substrate .      ]",
    "the derivation of the gemn transport properties would be much easier , if the substrate contribution could be further reduced .",
    "to this end we fabricated another gemn sample , which employs a ge substrate with rt resistivity of having a well defined concentration of sb donors .",
    "the build up of a rectifying interface between the p - type gemn epi - layer and the n - type substrate would isolate the epi - layer electrically from the substrate .",

    "note that the substrate resistance is actually a factor of ten smaller than the resistance of the epi - layer for temperatures above , demonstrating the effectivity of the rectifying pn - barrier .",

    "a rt characterization of such devices is impossible , as parallel conduction through the substrate will be present .",
    "moreover , a rapid thermal annealing process to obtain ohmic contacts could not be used for these type of samples , as this resulted in a direct contact to the substrate which short circuits the pn - barrier .",
    "a laser assisted ultra short time annealing employed instead , however , did not provide ohmic contacts that work down to cryogenic temperatures .",
    "more sophisticated approaches might be explored to overcome this limitation and enable also low temperature measurements .",
    "in summary , the work presented here has shown that transport phenomena of non - degenerate gemn thin films with hole concentrations around fabricated on high resistivity ge substrates are not a consequence of the alloying of mn with ge .",
