    "since 1917 when levi - civita gave his static vacuum solution , cylindrically symmetric spacetimes have played an important role in general relativity . recently , attention has been mainly paid to dynamical situations or quantum issues .",
    "some of these aspects are surveyed in @xcite ( section 9 and references [ 247 - 263 ] , [ 275 - 277 ] therein ) , for example ; for even more recent works , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "still , in a recent concise review on static cylinders @xcite , bonnor introduces the topic by stating that ` the levi - civita spacetime continues to puzzle relativists ' .",
    "in contrast to the schwarzschild metric described completely by a single parameter , the levi - civita solution contains two essential constant parameters@xmath0 , related to the local curvature , and @xmath1 , determining the conicity of the spacetime .",
    "relating these two parameters to physical sources turns out to be delicate , as we recently found in the case of static cylindrical shells of various types of matter @xcite , and as we will demonstrate for solid perfect - fluid cylinders in the present paper .    in the second edition of the ` exact - solutions bible '",
    "@xcite , there are quoted about 20 papers on static perfect - fluid cylindrically symmetric fields . however , these solutions are local , no analysis of global properties is usually available .",
    "in addition , most perfect - fluid equations of state in the literature are either _ ad hoc _ or not very physically plausible .",
    "in fact , the cylindrical counterpart of the famous schwarzschild interior solution , in which the fluid is incompressible , so that its matter density @xmath2 constant , is not known .",
    "although this equation of state is unphysical ( implying infinite velocity of sound ) , in the spherical case not only can the corresponding solution be easily found but it also gives ` not unreasonable ' estimates for maximum masses of neutron stars , for example .    the purpose of the present work is to study static perfect - fluid cylinders and their fields globally , to investigate the newtonian limit and to analyse incompressible cylinders numerically . in section 2 ,",
    "we start from a line element in which the 3-space is rescaled by the norm of the timelike killing vector and we choose the distance from the axis as the radial coordinate .",
    "usually we require the axis to be regular , but the presence of a conical singularity ( a ` cosmic string ' ) along the axis is also considered .",
    "the field equations in these coordinates enable one to find convenient relations between some of the metric functions .",
    "in particular , the vacuum levi - civita solution can be rederived in these coordinates .",
    "we show in detail that although it contains five constants of integration , only two  the mass parameter and the conicity parameter  cannot be removed .    in section 3",
    "we first formulate a lemma ( and then prove it in appendix a ) stating that for a smooth equation of state @xmath3 and any value of the central density @xmath4 there exists a unique solution of the field equations in a neighbourhood of the axis , which can be continued into a global solution . depending on the equation of state , the fluid occupies the entire space , or the cylinder is of a finite extent in the radial direction provided that the pressure vanishes at a finite radius , @xmath5 .",
    "another lemma shows that a unique vacuum solution can be joined to the inner perfect - fluid solution at this radius @xmath6 where the pressure vanishes .",
    "finally , a theorem is proven asserting that systems with @xmath7 always have a finite radius  like with spherically symmetric balls .",
    "the field equations are written in terms of @xmath8 ( @xmath9the velocity of light ) ; for @xmath10 the newtonian limit is recovered .",
    "the conformal 3-space becomes flat and the relativistic tolman mass turns into the newtonian mass per unit length .",
    "this is demonstrated in section 4 . in appendix b ,",
    "the newtonian static constant - density cylinders and spheres are constructed directly within the newtonian theory for comparison .",
    "( for shell sources in newtonian gravity , see appendix in @xcite . )    in the brief section 5 it is explicitly shown how an outer levi - civita solution can be joined to an inner perfect - fluid solution at the boundary where the pressure vanishes .",
    "the need of a non - trivial conicity parameter , @xmath11 , outside a general perfect - fluid cylinder is discussed in detail in appendix c. as an example , the evans solution @xcite with the equation of state @xmath12 , @xmath13 , is employed to elucidate that only special cylinders can be joined to the outer levi - civita metrics with the conicity parameter @xmath14 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to cylinders of incompressible fluid . as mentioned above , exact solutions representing incompressible perfect fluid cylinders",
    "have not yet been found .",
    "we first study analytically weakly gravitating cylinders . expanding all functions entering the field equations in terms of the dimensionless radial distance from the axis",
    ", the pressure at any point is found in terms of the central pressure @xmath15 . inverting the series ,",
    "the radius of a cylinder can be determined by requiring the pressure to vanish . in this way",
    ", relativistic parameters characterizing the cylinder can be determined analytically as corrections to the newtonian values .",
    "the conicity parameter starts to deviate from its minkowskian value only by terms of the order @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "fully relativistic cylinders of incompressible fluid are treated numerically . here",
    "we extend considerably the results of stela and kramer @xcite .",
    "we allow the conicity parameter @xmath11 ( as one should  see above ) , admit high values of the central pressure and we also exhibit other quantities of interest graphically .",
    "in particular , we show how the proper radius of the cylinder increases with increasing central pressure , whereas the circumferential radius starts to decrease .",
    "the peculiar behaviour of the circumferential radius is well seen in the embedding diagram of the @xmath18 constant surfaces and their dependence on the central pressure .",
    "both the external levi - civita mass parameter and external conicity parameter are plotted as functions of the central pressure .",
    "it is illustrated graphically that the dimensionless mass per unit proper length has an upper bound of @xmath19 , whereas thorne s c - energy scalar is bounded from above by @xmath20 .",
    "we also plot dimensionless mass per unit coordinate / proper length of the cylinders as functions of their proper and circumferential radii and compare them with the case of incompressible spherical stars .",
    "we believe that full understanding of static cylindrical systems will give intuition for more realistic situations in the neighbourhood of elongated but finite systems .",
    "in addition , the only realistic hope to construct exact examples of interaction between simple physical matter and gravitational waves seems to live in cylindrical symmetry .",
    "even perturbative calculations of slowly rotating and oscillating cylinders might bring useful insights . the simple static configurations would then serve as convenient backgrounds .",
    "we define cylindrical symmetry for static non - vacuum spacetimes by assuming that in addition to the timelike killing vector , two further commuting killing vectors acting in hypersurfaces orthogonal to the ` static ' killing vector exist . adapting coordinates to the symmetries , we can write the line element with the metric in the 3-space rescaled by the norm of the timelike killing vector ( written as an exponential ) in the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 , where we keep the velocity of light @xmath9 because we wish to discuss the newtonian limit in detail .",
    "we assume circular orbits for @xmath23 and consider only spacetimes with a regular axis .",
    "occasionally , we admit an infinitely thin cosmic string , which is described by a conical singularity along the axis .",
    "the distance from the axis ( in the conformal 3-metric ) can be used to define a unique radial coordinate , i.e. , we put @xmath24 .",
    "there are many other geometrical choices for the radial coordinate .",
    "if we fix the range of @xmath25 to be @xmath26 , we obtain the following regularity conditions on the axis by comparing our form of the metric with the minkowskian metric ( possibly containing the conical singularity ) written in cylindrical coordinates : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the axis - conicity ; in particular , the axis is regular for @xmath29 .",
    "the functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 have to be differentiable functions of @xmath32 to ensure differentiability on the axis .",
    "the values ( [ initial conditions ] ) of @xmath33 and @xmath31 on the axis determine the normalization of the static and translational killing vectors .    for fluid cylinders we have @xmath34 where the 4-velocity @xmath35 is normalized as @xmath36 the fluid is assumed to be at rest in the coordinates of metric ( [ the original metric ] ) , hence @xmath37 .",
    "the einstein field equations @xmath38 imply ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "since @xmath31 is a metric function , we denote the ` external ' levi - civita conicity parameter by @xmath1 ( cf . equation and below ) and the ` internal ' axis - conicity by @xmath28 as in equation . ] : @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 as we have three unknown functions and three second order equations , , we expect six integration constants .",
    "the first - order equation reduces the number of constants in the solution to five .",
    "the conservation law @xmath44=0 gives @xmath45 we assume that an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath46 is given .",
    "then we can integrate the last equation , @xmath47 for incompressible fluid of density @xmath4 and central pressure @xmath15 , this can be integrated explicitly to yield @xmath48 for the value of @xmath33 on the surface @xmath49 with @xmath5 .",
    "the field equations can be simplified as follows : from equations ( [ equationrr ] ) , ( [ equationff ] ) and ( [ equationzz ] ) we can eliminate @xmath50 to obtain @xmath51 can be rewritten as @xmath52 hence , we obtain two equations for @xmath33 and for the product @xmath53 .    one immediate consequence of the field equations : take @xmath54 ( [ equationzz])@xmath55 ( [ equationff ] ) and consider the above initial conditions ( [ initial conditions ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath56 for @xmath57 .    to construct local solutions having a prescribed eos and ignoring the regularity of the axis",
    ", one can proceed as follows : given @xmath3 , equation ( [ integration of u ] ) implies there are unique functions @xmath58 , @xmath59 . inserting these functions in equations ( [ only bc equation ] ) ,",
    "( [ only bc and u equation ] ) , we can solve for @xmath33 and @xmath53 locally .",
    "next , equations ( [ equationff ] ) and ( [ equationzz ] ) determine @xmath60 and @xmath31 . is satisfied as a consequence of the bianchi identities .",
    "hence , given an eos , there are many local solutions away from the axis .",
    "infinitely extended solutions with some special equations of state ( @xmath61 ) were derived in @xcite , while finite solutions satisfying energy conditions were obtained in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider polytropic equations of state using numerical solutions of the structure equations",
    ".    we can also easily find _ vacuum _ solutions in the above coordinates . for simplicity , we now put @xmath62",
    ". implies @xmath63 with constant parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( if @xmath66 then either @xmath67 or @xmath68 in contradiction with ( [ the original metric ] ) ) . from ( [ equationtt ] ) , we have @xmath69 , so we can write @xmath70 where we introduced a third integration constant @xmath71 of , following from @xmath72 constant . ]",
    ". substituting for @xmath53 we find @xmath73 with @xmath74 being a fourth integration constant .",
    "to find @xmath60 and @xmath31 , we have to solve ( [ equationff ] ) and ( [ equationzz ] ) with vanishing rhs , taking into account @xmath63 .",
    "the solutions can be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a fifth integration constant and @xmath77 .",
    "( we can also interchange the roles of @xmath60 and @xmath31 .",
    "as long as we have no axis we can not really distinguish between the two killing vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 . ) from the relation for @xmath80 we can see that the range of @xmath71 for which solutions exist is @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "it is thus advantageous to introduce a new constant @xmath82 $ ] such that @xmath83 . with this definition ,",
    "the exponents in ( [ original b , c ] ) can be written @xmath84 .",
    "introducing @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the resulting metric functions read @xmath89 the solution thus has five constants of integration .",
    "however , we now show that three of these constants are redundant .",
    "we shall see that this is related to the fact that the killing vectors @xmath90 are defined only up to constant multiplicative factors and , in addition , the whole metric can be rescaled by a constant .",
    "first , denote @xmath91^{\\sqrt{\\gamma ( 1-\\gamma)}}$ ] and introduce new constants @xmath92 and @xmath93 by the relations @xmath94 then apply the transformation @xmath95 \\rightarrow [ { \\tau \\over \\alpha } , \\ : \\alpha ( 1+m^2)^\\frac { m^2 } { 1+m^2 } \\zeta , \\ : \\frac { \\alpha \\rho_0 } { 1+m^2 } \\left ( \\frac { \\rho } { \\rho_0 } \\right)^{1+m^2 } \\hspace{-0.8 cm } \\;\\ ; - b , \\ : \\varphi].\\ ] ] this leads to the metric of the form @xmath96 containing three constants only .",
    "next , use a linear coordinate transformation with a scaling parameter @xmath97 , which will be fixed subsequently , as follows : @xmath98 \\rightarrow [ q^\\frac { m } { m^2-m+1 } t , \\ : q^\\frac { m(m-1 ) } { m^2-m+1 } z , \\ : q^\\frac { m(m-1 ) } { m^2-m+1 } r , \\ : \\varphi].\\ ] ] this yields @xmath99 by choosing @xmath97 appropriately , we can dispose of either @xmath93 or @xmath100 so that the resulting metric involves only two constants .",
    "indeed , setting @xmath101 we eliminate @xmath100 in ( [ transformed lc ] ) : @xmath102 where we put @xmath103 . with @xmath104 ,",
    "this is the standard levi - civita metric as given in the primary reference @xcite , equation ( 22.7 ) . in ( [",
    "lc without rho_0 ] ) , the @xmath105 and @xmath106 coordinates and the conicity parameter @xmath1 do not have the usual dimensions .",
    "we can maintain the conventional dimensions if we set @xmath107 , thus obtaining @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "notice , however , that this can not be done for @xmath110 .",
    "hence , this coordinate system has the usual dimensions but ( [ lc without c ] ) does not include the standard cosmic string as the limit @xmath111 only yields the flat spacetime without deficit angle . in the following ,",
    "we use the form ( [ lc without rho_0 ] ) .    note",
    "that if the @xmath79 symmetry is considered locally only , we can also rescale @xmath25 and thus put @xmath14 in ( [ lc without rho_0 ] ) .",
    "this is not the case , however , as we insist on a particular range of @xmath25 and require @xmath112 .",
    "our aim here is to show that for a given barotropic eos , a unique global solution corresponds to each value of the pressure on the axis @xmath113 we analyze cylinders of incompressible fluids . ] .",
    "depending on the eos , the fluid cylinder either is of a finite extent , or the fluid occupies the entire space .",
    "( in this section we again put @xmath62 . )",
    "we begin with the construction of solutions with a regular axis . inserting",
    "taylor series for the metric coefficients into the field equations indicates that for a given analytic equation of state @xmath3 , a value @xmath15 of the pressure at the center determines a unique solution .",
    "we prove the following lemma in [ regular axis ] .",
    "* lemma 1 : * _ let @xmath3 be a barotropic equation of state . then for each value of the central density @xmath114 there is @xmath115 such that a unique solution of the field equations ( [ equationtt])([u of p ] ) exists for @xmath116 . _    next we show that the solution can be extended as long as the pressure is positive .",
    "* lemma 2 : * _ suppose we have a solution with a regular axis",
    ". then @xmath33 , @xmath60 and @xmath31 are monotonically increasing and @xmath117 is monotonically decreasing as long as @xmath118 ( then also @xmath119 ) . _    * proof : * @xmath120 and @xmath121 are positive near the center .",
    "if any of them vanished at some point , then equation would give a contradiction because we assumed @xmath118 , and @xmath122 near the center as a consequence of the regularity conditions ( [ initial conditions ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath60 and @xmath31 are monotonically increasing",
    ".    implies  due to @xmath123that @xmath124 .",
    "hence @xmath50 is positive near the center .",
    "assume @xmath125 ; then @xmath126 means that @xmath33 can not have a maximum at @xmath127 , so @xmath33 is monotonically increasing , i.e. , @xmath128 .",
    "then implies @xmath129 .",
    "( this is really the maximum principle for @xmath130 . )",
    "now we have the following possibilities :    \\(1 ) the pressure is positive for all values of @xmath106",
    ". then the fluid fills all the space and it is not possible to extend the solution because radial ( @xmath106-)lines have an infinite proper length ( cf equations ( [ the original metric ] ) , ( [ integration of u ] ) ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the pressure vanishes at some value of @xmath106",
    ". then we show in the next lemma that a unique vacuum solution can be joined to the inner solid solution .",
    "* lemma 3 : * _ if @xmath5 , a unique vacuum solution  a particular levi - civita solution  can be joined to the fluid cylinder .",
    "_    * proof : * we first show that @xmath131 is finite . for equations of state with a positive boundary density , @xmath132 , this is obvious from equation .",
    "if however , the boundary density vanishes , the integral in equation could diverge for @xmath133 .",
    "if this happens , we use the fact that @xmath134 and @xmath135 are positive .",
    "therefore , from equation we have @xmath136 so that @xmath137 this shows that @xmath50 is bounded for @xmath138 if the eos is monotonic ( in fact , it is sufficient to assume that @xmath3 is bounded on @xmath139 $ ] ) .",
    "the same holds for @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , the monotonicity of @xmath33 and the upper bound on @xmath140 imply that @xmath141 have limits at @xmath6 .",
    "as @xmath141 have limits at @xmath6 , we can consider equations ( [ equationff ] ) and ( [ equationzz ] ) as linear equations for @xmath60 and @xmath31 with given coefficients .",
    "this implies that @xmath60 , @xmath120 , @xmath31 and @xmath121 have limits at @xmath6 .",
    "all field equations remain meaningful for @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , the constants @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath131 , @xmath147 provide the boundary values for the vacuum field equations ; these have a unique solution  a levi - civita solution .",
    "since the metric is @xmath148 in our radial coordinate , the junction conditions at the boundary are satisfied by construction .    summarizing ,",
    "we have shown that a barotropic eos determines a 1-parameter family of global spacetimes .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , solutions with constant density , the analogues of the interior schwarzschild solutions , have so far not been found as explicit exact solutions . in section [ numerics ] examples of cylinders with @xmath149=constant",
    "are constructed numerically .",
    "the following theorem shows that a general constant - density cylinder always has a finite radius .",
    "* theorem : * _ [ theorem ] for a solution with a regular axis , a barotropic eos and a positive boundary density @xmath150 , there is a finite radius @xmath6 with @xmath5 . _",
    "* proof : * suppose that @xmath117 is positive for all @xmath106 .",
    "implies that @xmath33 has a limit for @xmath151 .",
    "we want to show first that @xmath152 .",
    "if this is not the case , then there is a sequence @xmath153 with @xmath154 . since @xmath50 is integrable",
    ", the peaks where @xmath50 reaches the value @xmath155 repeatedly must become ever narrower with increasing @xmath106 s .",
    "therefore , there must be values of @xmath106 where there are arbitrary high positive and negative values of @xmath140 .",
    "however , equation shows that @xmath140 is bounded and we have a contradiction .",
    "thus , @xmath152 .",
    "we can rewrite equation as @xmath156 so that by integration we get @xmath157 eliminating the pressure through equation , we obtain @xmath158 or @xmath159 due to equation , we further have @xmath160 if @xmath53 is bounded , the first integral gives a positive contribution to @xmath50 and we have a contradiction with @xmath161 because the second term in ( [ integral for u ] ) is also positive .",
    "for @xmath53 unbounded , we calculate the limit of the integral for @xmath151 by lhospital rule as @xmath162 now for @xmath151 either both terms in equation ( which are positive ) are finite , or , if one vanishes , the other diverges and we again have a contradiction with @xmath152 .",
    "hence , @xmath117 has to vanish at some finite radius .",
    "note that equations ( [ per parts integral for u ] ) , ( [ nitty gritty ] ) and ( [ constraint ] ) imply that this conclusion is valid for both a regular axis ( @xmath163 ) and for an axis with a cosmic string ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "for a systematic treatment of the newtonian limit , we refer to @xcite .",
    "above , we have already chosen our variables in such a way that the field equations have a limit for a diverging velocity of light , i.e. , for @xmath165 . for @xmath10 ,",
    "equations ( [ equationtt][equationzz ] ) imply @xmath166 @xmath167 @xmath168 @xmath169 @xmath170 equations ( [ newtonian limit rr])([newtonian limit zz ] ) show that the conformal 3-space is flat in the newtonian limit .",
    "to adapt the coordinates to the axial symmetry and the regularity of the axis ( cf equations ( [ initial conditions ] ) ) , we have to choose @xmath171 , @xmath172 . then becomes the poisson equation for the newtonian gravitational potential : @xmath173    the field equations depend on @xmath174 in such a way that it is easy to demonstrate the existence of families of exact solutions that have a newtonian limit .",
    "suppose we choose an eos that is independent of @xmath174 .",
    "the theorem in [ regular axis ] , which is used to obtain solutions with a regular axis , also shows that these solutions depend smoothly on @xmath174 and that the limiting solution satisfies the equations for @xmath10 .",
    "the same is true for the extension of the solution up to the radius where the pressure vanishes .",
    "suppose we have such a @xmath174-family of solutions with finite radii @xmath175 for all @xmath174 s .",
    "integration of equation up to the boundary gives @xmath176 the constant @xmath177 is the tolman mass ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since all metric coefficients have limits for @xmath178 , equation implies that the limit of @xmath179 is the newtonian mass per unit length @xmath180 the corresponding results for newtonian cylinders and spheres are summarized in [ newtonian full cylinders and shells ] .",
    "next , we want to demonstrate explicitly how a fluid solution , with the property that the pressure vanishes at some fixed @xmath49 such that all metric coefficients and their first derivatives are finite there , can be uniquely matched to a vacuum solution given by functions ( [ lc with 5 constants ] ) of ( [ lc with 5 constants ] ) , @xmath100 of ( [ lc with 3 constants ] ) , @xmath6 of ( [ lc without c ] ) and the coordinate @xmath6 , proper @xmath181 and circumferential @xmath182 radii of the cylinder defined by equations ( [ proper radius definition ] ) , ( [ circumferential radius definition ] ) . in this section again @xmath62 . ] .",
    "this is obvious because all the equations are regular for @xmath183 .",
    "hence we can just take the values of the metric and their first radial derivatives as the initial values for the vacuum field equations and obtain a unique solution satisfying the matching conditions ( the metric and its first derivatives continuous ) by construction .",
    "let us note that , as we have checked , we obtain the same results by requiring that ( i ) the cylinder s proper circumference is the same as measured from both sides of the surface and ( ii ) the surface energy - momentum tensor ( calculated using the general israel formalism @xcite ) vanishes .    equations and imply @xmath184 on the surface , we have to satisfy equations ( [ lc with 5 constants ] ) : on the left - hand sides we have the metric potentials obtained by integration within the cylinder , from these we now determine the five constants on the right - hand side .    denoting @xmath185",

    "the set of the ordinary differential ( field ) equations ( [ equationtt])([equationzz ] ) can be simplified by converting it into the dimensionless form : @xmath198 here the dimensionless radial coordinate @xmath199 , where @xmath200 , with @xmath4 being a characteristic ( e.g. , the central ) fluid density ; the dimensionless fluid density is @xmath201 and the dimensionless pressure @xmath202 ( this is not an eos ) .",

    "there is , however , a fundamental difference between the spherical and cylindrical configurations  in the spherical case in standard schwarzschild spherical coordinates , the radial component of the metric tensor depends on the density but not on the pressure .",

    "although the main results were announced in the introductory section already , let us briefly summarize them here , emphasizing those aspects that appear to be new in the subject of cylindrical symmetry in general relativity .",
    "our primary goal , in contrast to majority of other works , has been ( i ) to understand the global character of spacetimes with static perfect fluid cylinders , ( ii ) to study weakly gravitating cylinders and their newtonian limit and ( iii ) to analyze in detail cylinders of incompressible fluid . except for the last item",
    ", we did not start from an _ a priori _ equation of state , so our results are of a general character .",
    "we have shown that for any smooth monotonic equation of state and for any density at the axis of symmetry there exists a unique solution in some neighborhood of the axis which is regular at the axis and can be uniquely extended to a global solution . in other words ,",
    "the equation of state determines a one - parameter family of global spacetimes .",
    "if the pressure vanishes at a finite value of the radial coordinate then a unique levi - civita vacuum solution can be joined to the inner perfect - fluid solution .",
    "in particular , we prove that the cylinder has a finite radius if the monotonic equation of state admits a non - vanishing density for zero pressure ( as is the case for incompressible fluid , for example ) .",
    "in general , the outside levi - civita solution is determined by both the mass ( curvature ) parameter and the conicity parameter .",
    "the need for a nontrivial conicity parameter in the external vacuum region and the fact that both the mass and conicity parameters are determined uniquely by the value of the density / pressure at the axis of the fluid cylinder do not appear to have been elucidated before .    in the newtonian limit , we prove that the spatial metric inside the fluid cylinders is conformally flat .",
    "the relativistic tolman mass becomes the newtonian mass per unit length . for comparison ,",
    "we also discussed cylinders and spheres of perfect fluid constructed _ ab initio _ in the newtonian theory .    in the case of relativistic cylinders of incompressible fluid",
    ", no analytical solution is available .",
    "however , we succeeded in deriving analytic results for the relativistic corrections to the newtonian cylinders . for weekly relativistic cylinders , the levi - civita mass parameter and the conicity parameter , for example ,",
    "are given by equations ( [ series for m ] ) and ( [ series for c ] ) .",
    "for fully relativistic cylinders , various physical quantities of interest were found by numerical integration of the field equations and they are exhibited graphically ( figures 18 in section 6 ) .",
    "the resulting configurations are determined uniquely by the dimensionless pressure @xmath301 at the axis . as the central pressure increases , the pressure away from the axis decreases more rapidly so that relativistic cylinders become more compact than the newtonian ones .",
    "a remarkable phenomenon , unnoticed so far , arises in the relativistic regime : while the ( dimensionless ) proper radius of the cylinders increases with increasing central pressure , the ( dimensionless ) circumferential radius starts to decrease for still ` physical ' values of @xmath302 ; the circumferential radius has only a bounded range of values .",
    "this phenomenon is nicely illustrated by the embedding diagrams of the surfaces @xmath303constant ( figure [ embedding ] ) .",
    "the external levi - civita mass parameter @xmath0 increases with @xmath251 , approaching @xmath304 as @xmath262 , whereas the quantity @xmath305 characterising the conicity increases without limit as @xmath306 .",
    "the dimensionless mass per unit proper length inside the cylinders starts to decrease for highly relativistic cylinders ( it has an upper bound of @xmath19 ) , but the analogous mass per unit coordinate length increases without bound .",
    "thorne s c - energy increases with @xmath251 and approaches @xmath20 as @xmath251 becomes large .    at the end of the preceding section",
    ", a comparison of cylindrical and spherical configurations of incompressible fluid shows similarities and fundamental differences between the two cases ( figures 8 and 9 ) .",
    "the ` external ' levi - civita conicity parameter , the importance of which has been emphasized throughout the text , takes various values depending on the ` inner ' cylinder , which is regular everywhere .",
    "however , to include more general situations , we also considered an infinitely thin cosmic string ( see equation ( [ initial conditions ] ) ) , i.e. , a conical singularity along the axis of symmetry inside the cylinder .",
    "this produces the ` axis conicity ' which enters various formulae , like the tolman mass , but it does not , for example , influence the conclusions of the theorem stating that a cylinder has a finite radius if the equation of state admits positive density at vanishing pressure",
    ".    finally , to ` end with the beginning ' , let us remark again that only full understanding of the static situation will enable a sufficiently thorough treatment of problems such as the interaction of cylindrical gravitational waves with static cylindrical matter configurations .",
