    "a survey of galaxies at high redshift is a direct approach to understand formation and evolution of galaxies . in this decade",
    ", the color selection technique utilizing blue uv continuum slope and lyman break of star - forming galaxies has found so - called lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; e.g. , @xcite ) at @xmath7 ( @xmath82 gyr after big bang ) .",
    "then various studies have been revealing their detailed properties such as uv luminosity function ( uvlf ) @xcite , uv spectroscopic features ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and stellar population ( e.g. , @xcite ) etc , opening the new era to understand galaxies at high redshift .    as a next step ,",
    "a survey for lbgs at higher redshift is required .",
    "we focused on redshift 5 , because it is @xmath81gyr ( corresponding to the maximum age estimation of lbgs at @xmath7 ) earlier than @xmath7 and the highest redshift at which the two - color ( secure ) lyman break selection using standard optical bands can be applied .",
    "we have obtained deep and wide @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11-bands images with subaru @xcite and suprime - cam @xcite in / around the goods - n field and the j0053 + 1234 field ( @xcite ; iwata et al .",
    "2005 in prep . ) and successfully constructed a largest , @xmath81000 galaxies with @xmath12 , sample of lbg candidates at @xmath0 among other similar surveys ( @xcite ) .",
    "now we investigate properties of these lbgs at @xmath0 .",
    "their statistical and photometric properties such as uvlf rest - frame uv to optical color , etc . are presented and discussed in iwata s contribution in this proceedings ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we report the results of spectroscopic observations of our lbgs at @xmath0 and discuss their uv spectroscopic features . throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt flat @xmath13 cosmology , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16[km s@xmath17mpc@xmath17 ] .",
    "the magnitude system is based on ab magnitude .",
    "we made optical spectroscopy for a part of our lbg sample in the goods - n field and the j0053 + 1234 field using multi - object - spectroscopy ( mos ) mode of the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; @xcite ) attached to the subaru telescope .",
    "spectroscopic targets were selected from photometric catalog of our survey for lbgs at @xmath0 .",
    "details of imaging observation and color selection are described in @xcite and iwata et al.(2005 in prep . ) .",
    "main spectroscopic targets are our lbg candidates brighter than @xmath19 mag .",
    "since one mask of focas mos covers a 6@xmath20 aperture diameter field of view , we designed mos masks to contain main targets as many as possible on each mos field .",
    "so far , we observed four mos fields : three masks in the goods - n field and one mask in the j0053 + 1234 field which contain 24 bright targets .",
    "we also included faint lbg candidates ( @xmath21 mag ) as many as possible in each mask .",
    "spectroscopic observations were made in 2003 and 2004 under a clear condition .",
    "we used the grism of 300 lines / mm blazed at 7500  and the so58 order cut filter .",
    "this setting gave wavelength coverage from 5800  to 10000depending on a slit position on a mask .",
    "the mos slit widths were fixed to be 0.@xmath228 , giving a spectral resolution of r@xmath8700 which was measured by night sky emission .",
    "an exposure time of each frame was 0.5 hours , and a total effective exposure time was @xmath23 hours .",
    "this exposure time was set to detect continuum feature of main targets .",
    "seeings during the observing runs were @xmath80.@xmath248 .",
    "among 24 main targets , we identified 9 objects to be lbgs at @xmath0 .",
    "examples of resultant spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "redshifts of these objects are confirmed with continuum depression shortward of redshifted ly@xmath3 and some line features such as ly@xmath3 emission and low ionized interstellar ( lis ) metal absorption lines which are characteristic features of nearby starburst galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and lbgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "intriguingly , these bright lbgs generally show no or a weak ly@xmath3 emission and relatively strong lis absorption lines , though the sample size is still small .",
    "figure 2 presents the composite spectra of bright lbgs at @xmath0 ( thick line : @xcite ) and lbgs at @xmath7 ( thin line : @xcite ) for comparison .",
    "the average rest - frame equivalent widths of ly@xmath3 and three lis absorption lines ( siii @xmath251260 , oi+siii @xmath251303 , and cii @xmath251334 ) of these bright lbgs at @xmath0 are @xmath26  and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the value of ew of ly@xmath3 emission is small by considering that ly@xmath3 emission is often seen in lbgs at @xmath7 and more than 1/4 of them have strong ( ew@xmath520 ) ly@xmath3 emission .",
    "the average value of ew of three lis absorption lines is stronger than that of lbgs at @xmath7 ( @xmath28 : @xcite ) .",
    "assuming the local relation between lis absorption and metallicity by @xcite , we can estimate their metallicity of 12@xmath29log(o / h)@xmath30 ( 1/5 solar ) .",
    "we also found a velocity offset between the peak of ly@xmath3 emission with respect to that of average of lis lines ; peaks of ly@xmath3 emission are redshifted @xmath31 km s@xmath17 to lis absorption for five objects .",
    "similar velocity offsets were also reported in lbgs at @xmath32 ( e.g.,@xcite ) which may be related to a large scale outflow .",
    "reminders of spectroscopic main sample are not identified because of their low s / n , but we found 2 objects among them to be possible elliptical galaxies at foreground redshift ( @xmath33 ) from their continuum features like 4000  break .    besides main targets , we confirmed 2 objects among faint bonus targets with @xmath4 to be lbgs at @xmath0 using their strong and asymmetric ly@xmath3 emission line , though lis absorptions were not seen due to low continuum s / n .",
    "in contrast to the result for main , bright , targets describe above , ly@xmath3 emissions of these faint lbgs are quite strong ( average ew@xmath34 58.5 ) , and these are expected to be detected as ly@xmath3 emitters ( laes ) .",
    "this result suggests that ew of ly@xmath3 emission of lbgs at @xmath0 depends on the uv luminosity .",
    "figure 3 shows the positions of identified objects in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 two color diagram .",
    "filled circles show lbgs at @xmath0 ( 7 bright objects as large circles and 2 faint objects as small ones ) , and crosses show foreground objects . in order to examine our color selection criteria",
    ", we also observed some objects located outside but close to the criteria . as a result",
    ", four objects were identified to be galactic m stars which are also plotted as crosses in figure 3 .",
    "these results suggest that our selection criteria for lbgs at @xmath0 are reasonable .",
    "we found the sign of luminosity dependence of ew of ly@xmath3 emission in lbgs at @xmath0 ; the lack of strong ( ew@xmath520 ) ly@xmath3 emission in bright lbgs at @xmath0 . in order to examine this trend",
    ", we compiled past results of the spectroscopy of galaxies at similar redshift . figure 4 shows the ew@xmath6 of ly@xmath3 emission against the rest - frame uv absolute magnitude . filled circles show our results and filled squares are the results of spectroscopies of galaxies at @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we also show the sfr estimated from uv absolute magnitude using the relation by @xcite of @xmath38 which is a typical value of lbgs at @xmath7 . ] .",
    "this figure clearly shows that there are no uv luminous lbgs at @xmath0 with strong ( ew@xmath520 ) ly@xmath3 emission , while uv faint ones tend to have strong ly@xmath3 emission .",
    "in addition , there seems to be a uv magnitude threshold for lbgs with strong ly@xmath3 emission around @xmath3921.5 mag which is almost the same as the @xmath40 magnitude of uv luminosity function of our @xmath0 lbg sample @xcite . in figure 4 , crosses show lyman @xmath3 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath41 from narrow - band imaging data @xcite .",
    "the ew distribution of laes is similar to that of faint lbgs with strong ly@xmath3 emission , suggesting the fraction of laes to lbgs changes with the uv luminosity at @xmath0 universe .",
    "this is consistent with past result of @xcite ; a number ratio of laes to lbgs at @xmath0 decreases with increasing uv luminosity .",
    "if the absence of strong ly@xmath3 emission is due to the dust extinction , luminous lbgs at @xmath0 may have chemically evolved to some extent .",
    "presence of strong lis absorption and the estimated metallicity ( @xmath81/5 solar ) also support this idea .",
    "it seems that luminous lbgs at @xmath0 started star formation relatively earlier than faint ones .",
    "further , results of clustering analysis of lbgs at @xmath0 show bright lbgs have a larger correlation length than faint ones , suggesting bright lbgs reside in more massive dark halos ( @xcite ; see also the contribution by iwata et al . in this proceedings ) .",
    "this fact also implies that bright lbgs at @xmath0 have experienced star formation earlier than faint ones , i.e. , biased star formation in the early universe .",
    "of course , velocity structure and distribution of hi gas ( including dust ) in / around the galaxy also affect the strength of ly@xmath3 emission and its profile .",
    "we found asymmetry of ly@xmath3 emission line and the velocity offset between ly@xmath3 emission and lis absorption lines in a part of our sample , which implies the presence of a large scale motion of the neutral gas in / around lbgs at @xmath0 .",
    "thus we can not rule out the possibility that the effect of gas geometry and kinematics for the ew and profile of ly@xmath3 emission .    in any case",
    ", more spectroscopic sample of lbgs at @xmath0 is needed to study their spectroscopic features and discuss their luminosity dependence presented in this paper , which would give clues to understand evolution of galaxies in the early universe .",
