    "scattering of topological solitons that admit kink ( anti - kink ) solutions in presence of obstructions ie .",
    "barriers / wells have been given a considerable attention in some recent research work[5 - 10 ] .",
    "fei , et al [ 3 ] was first to investigate the interaction of soliton with a potential obstacle and many of the results in [ 3 ] were explained in [ 4 ] .",
    "these studies have shown that solitons behave like a point particle .",
    "they move in a well defined trajectories .",
    "when they meet a barrier they slows down and with enough energy they can come over the barrier and get transmitted otherwise they get reflected back . in case of a potential well ,",
    "they behave also similar to a point particle , in the sense they speed up in the well . however , solitons arise from classical field theory are expected to behave as a classical point particle but they do nt .",
    "point particles are always transmitted but solitons can be trapped in the well and can be reflected by the well which can be considered as peculiar behavior .",
    "a considerable amount of radiation is generated as a result of this peculiarity behavior [ 1 - 2,11 ] .",
    "the obstruction are constructed through the coupling constant @xmath1 which is made to be zero faraway from the obstruction and is required to have a non zero value in a certain region of space and so these potentials are square barriers and square wells . the obstructions can be made space dependent i.e. @xmath2 but with no exact solitonic solutions .",
    "these space dependent potentials are considered to be a perturbation in the theory .    in this paper following [ 5 ]",
    "we look for a class of space dependent potentials which are smooth and pose analytic solution for a static kink located at the center of these obstructions _",
    "ie_. @xmath3 .",
    "and so in this paper the parameter @xmath1 is a function of space _",
    "ie_. @xmath2 .",
    "this parameter is constrained to have a value of @xmath4 as @xmath5 and with this constraint the kink(anti kink)solution reduces to the usual @xmath0 solution . however ,",
    "close to or at the obstruction , @xmath6 new soliton solution is developed . in this paper our mathematical approach to developing such two different solutions one at the obstruction and the other one faraway from the obstruction is more generic .    in section 2 of this paper",
    "we review some basic facts of @xmath0 kink . in [ 5 ]",
    "they have found a two - parameter family of a class of smooth potentials for sine - gordon kinks located at @xmath3 . in section 3 of this paper",
    "we explain our mathematical approach to construct as is the case in [ 5 ] a two - parameter family of class of smooth potentials of @xmath0 kinks located at @xmath3 .",
    "this has been achieved through some constraints imposed over what we call an argument function of the field @xmath7 .",
    "this argument field function has been selected carefully so to allow kink ( anti kink ) solution in the @xmath0 model .",
    "the choice of the argument function determines the shape of these potentials and this in turn affects the dynamics of the kinks when they are in these potentials and when they come out .",
    "in section 4 we studied the dynamics of scattering of class of solitons with @xmath8 solutions with the corresponding potential barriers and potential wells .",
    "trajectories , @xmath9 , of all known phenomena were plotted .",
    "definitely a different choice of @xmath7 will result in a different trajectories . in section 5",
    "we calculated the critical velocities of a kink interacting with a barrier using the moduli space approximation and compared the results with numerical calculations .",
    "a kink solution for @xmath0 field theory in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions is one of the simplest model that admits kink solution .",
    "the model is described by the lagrangian density @xmath11    where @xmath12 is a scalar field and @xmath1 is a coupling constant . applying the euler - lagrange equation leads to the following field equation    @xmath13    the stationary soliton solution for the static field @xmath14 , for which @xmath1 is constant ,",
    "can be obtained by solving the static field equation    @xmath15    the static field that solves ( [ static eq ] ) is    @xmath16    where@xmath17 corresponds to kink(anti kink ) solutions and @xmath18 is a constant of integration which corresponds to the location of the soliton .",
    "the total energy of static @xmath0 kink is given by    @xmath19     + the energy can be evaluated to be @xmath20 and so the bogomolny bound is @xmath21    the field and energy solutions are singular as @xmath22 which illustrate a general feature of solitons .",
    "the theory is lorentz invariant and so the solution ( [ wojtek ] ) can be boosted to obtain a time - dependent solution thus the field is allowed to evolve with time    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the velocity of the soliton and @xmath25 is the lorentz factor .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the parameter @xmath1 as a function of space _ ie_. @xmath2 and so we are looking for kink(anti kink ) solution that can solve the following static field equation    @xmath26    to solve the static field equation ( [ static ] ) with the parameter @xmath1 is space dependent we will consider a solution of the form @xmath27    where @xmath7 is the field argument function which we are going to write it down explicitly after imposing some constraints on it so that we can have a possible static kink ( anti kink ) solution . the range of ( [ * ] ) is @xmath28    and so the range of @xmath7 is @xmath29 .    inserting the static field ( [ * ] ) into the static filed equation ( [ static])with @xmath1 now is made space dependent gives    @xmath30    with the parameter @xmath1 is being space dependent we can impose some constraints on the argument function @xmath7 . from ( [ * * ] ) @xmath2 is    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 . and",
    "in order to facilitate our calculations we will use@xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "we require that @xmath36 and @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "so , when the soliton is faraway from the obstruction the kink solution reduces to ( [ wojtek ] ) since the parameter @xmath1 is constant .",
    "that is we want the usual @xmath10 kink ( [ wojtek ] ) to be the asymptotic solution to the field equation ( 8) .",
    "we can see from ( [ * * * ] ) that if @xmath39 which is the usual argument for the kink field then @xmath40 . also because the soliton field of this model is centered at the origin we will demand that @xmath41 as @xmath42 .    in order to obtain a kink ( anti kink ) solution",
    "we need the function @xmath7 to be monotonic .",
    "so , we further set another constraint on the function @xmath7 requiring that the    @xmath43 , kink solution + @xmath44 , anti kink solution    kink solution corresponds to an increasing monotonic function and anti kink solution corresponds to a monotonic decreasing function .",
    "we further put some constraints on our selection of the function @xmath7 .",
    "these constraints arise from the constraints that we have already mentioned for @xmath34 .    and so , the requirement that the limit as @xmath5 , @xmath36 implies that    @xmath45    @xmath46    so as to have smooth potentials we require that the function @xmath7 to be differentiable and continuous on @xmath47 .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 must satisfy the differentiability and continuity conditions for every @xmath47 and so when expanded using taylor s expansion we obtain    @xmath48    differentiating ( [ * * * ] ) we get    @xmath49    and using the constraints we have set we obtain    @xmath50    therefore , the only none zero term is the zeroth order i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "we will consider only the obstructions located at @xmath3 .",
    "the energy density is given by    @xmath52    on the limit as @xmath5 the energy density reduces to    @xmath53    the total energy of the static field _",
    "ie_. rest mass energy on the asymptotic limit is given by    @xmath54    we are now to select carefully an argument function amongst many possibilities.the choice of the argument function determines the shape of these potentials and this in turn affects the dynamics properties of the kinks when they are in these potentials and when they come out . the dynamics are contained in this choice of @xmath7 .",
    "a possible argument function that give rise to a kink ( anti kink ) field and satisfy all the constraints that have been set is    @xmath55    where the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 have been inserted to take control over the obstructions .",
    "as @xmath5 , the term @xmath58 in ( [ g1 ] ) will be dominated and so    @xmath59 , kink solution    @xmath60 , anti kink solution    we will consider only the kink solution for which @xmath59 .    by using ( [ * * * ] ) we can solve for the space dependent potentials i.e.@xmath2 , which will from now on be designated as @xmath61    @xmath62    asymptotically,@xmath63 is    @xmath64    and this sets @xmath65 because we need to satisfy the constraint that requires , @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "generically , with @xmath68 for @xmath69 there will be no obstruction formed and so no interesting dynamics can be shown , see figure 1 .",
    "[ non ]    , width=302 ]    we will demand for physical application that @xmath70 .    for @xmath71",
    "@xmath72    and the requirement for kink solution is that @xmath43 . this inequality is satisfied only when @xmath73 , and hence @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75    in general , we get singularities when @xmath76    for @xmath77 we get a pure barriers and for @xmath78 we get a pure wells .    for @xmath79",
    "a kink solution implies that    @xmath80    this would lead to the inequality @xmath81 .",
    "however , this is not sufficient to determine the lower bound .",
    "we require for barriers that @xmath82 therefore , with @xmath83 , @xmath57 obeys the inequality @xmath84    and for wells the requirement is @xmath85    wells , which satisfies our requirement are obtained for @xmath86    for @xmath87    @xmath88    similar to @xmath79 case , barriers are obtained for @xmath89 and wells are obtained for @xmath90 .",
    "the lower bound for barriers and the upper bound for wells that satisfy our requirement can be determined numerically .    in figure ( [ barriers ] )",
    ", we plotted three different types of potential barriers for @xmath91 and in figure ( 4 ) we plotted three different types of wells for @xmath91 .",

    "( 5 ) shows how the top of the barrier and the bottom s of a well are widen for @xmath96 .",
    "one can see from the figures ( [ bw81 ] ) that the volcano barrier is almost like two separated wells and the double wells is almost like two separated barriers .",

    "having we found the appropriate argument of the static field we boost the solution by performing lorentz transformation along @xmath97-axis ie :    @xmath98    where as usual @xmath25 .",
    "now , the time dependent field is given by    @xmath99    the simulation of time evolution of the field were performed using 4th order runge kutta method . in this work",
    "we have used a grid containing 1201 points with lattice spacing of @xmath100 and time step was chosen to be @xmath101 .",
    "hence , our lattice extends from -60 to 60 in the @xmath97-direction .",
    "before we explore the scattering dynamics of the @xmath0 kinks with these potentials we will compare between numerical calculations and theoretical calculations of the total energy so to give an insight on the agreement between them and to use them later in our calculations for the critical velocities .",
    "the total energy , @xmath102 is given by    @xmath103    tables 1 - 3 , show the results of the numerical calculated and theoretical calculated total energy using ( [ et ] ) for @xmath91 for some various values of the parameter @xmath57 whereas the parameter @xmath65 .    .soliton",

    "in this paper we have considered a class of potentials using two parameters family ie . @xmath105 and @xmath57 .",
    "these parameters control the shape , heights and widths of such potentials .",
    "this work gives rise to a class of potentials with @xmath8 that are themselves solutions to the field equation .",
    "this means that a static kink at presence of these potentials are explicitly known . in the asymptotic limit",
    "the static kink solution is also known and reduces to the familiar kink solution .",
    "we have only considered a particular parameter values ( @xmath65 , @xmath106)that generate various potentials which include pure barriers and wells , barriers with two side narrow wells , wells with two side humps , volcano barriers and double wells .",
    "we have examined the dynamics of @xmath0 kinks with @xmath8 when they interact with these potentials .",
    "we have reproduced all relevant phenomena that are known such as trapping , back - reflection , and escape . with such potentials which are a mixture of barriers and wells ,",
    "an interesting dynamics have been seen and the trajectories , @xmath9 have been plotted . as is the case in preceding work",
    "there is a critical velocity above which the soliton was able to escape the potential and below which the soliton is either reflect or trapped .",
    "we have then compared numerically calculated critical velocities to theoretical calculations using two different equations .",
    "there was a very good agreement between numerical and theoretical calculations .",
    "also , energy of these solitons at @xmath3 are also numerically and theoretically compared and we found that they have an exact agreement for @xmath71 and agree to a very good extent for the others .    in this paper",
    "we have chosen a particular soliton model namely @xmath0 and have also selected a particular argument function of the field to generate kink solutions one is close to or at the obstruction and the other one faraway .",
    "however , we can apply the same work on other soliton models as well .",
    "this type of argument function can be truncated to a certain @xmath104 and so we can have as many parameter family as we want from which we can generate various potentials .",
