    ". they may also be important as precursors to black holes that coalesce and power bright early quasars .",
    "the first stars are thought to form inside dark matter halos of mass @xmath5@xmath6 at redshifts @xmath7 .",
    "these halos consist of 85% dark matter and 15% baryons in the form of metal - free gas made of hydrogen and helium .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that the baryonic matter cools and collapses via molecular hydrogen cooling @xcite into a single small protostar @xcite at the center of the halo ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite ) .    previously , three of us@xcite ( hereafter , paper i ) considered the effect of dark matter ( dm ) particles on the first stars during their formation .",
    "we focused on weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which are the favorite dark matter candidate of many physicists because they automatically provide approximately the right amount of dark matter , i.e.  24% of the current energy density of the universe .",
    "wimps are their own antiparticles , and annihilate with themselves in the early universe , leaving behind this relic density .",
    "probably the best example of a wimp is the lightest supersymmetric particle . in particular , the neutralino , the supersymmetric partner of the w , z , and higgs bosons , has the required weak interaction cross section and mass @xmath8 gev - tev to give the correct amount of dark matter . for a review of susy dark matter see @xcite . as our canonical values",
    ", we used the standard value @xmath9 for the annihilation cross section and @xmath10 for the wimp particle mass , but also considered a broader range of wimp masses ( 1 gev10 tev ) and cross - sections .",
    "to 50 gev2 tev , while @xmath11 lies within an order of magnitude of @xmath12 ( except at the low end of the mass range where it could be several orders of magnitude smaller ) .",
    "nonthermal particles can have annihilation cross - sections that are many orders of magnitude larger ( e.g.  @xcite ) and would have even more drastic effects . with present state of the field",
    "there are many types of dm candidates which could apply@xcite ]    we found that a crucial transition takes place when the hydrogen density of the collapsing protostar exceeds a critical value ( @xmath13 for a 100 gev wimp mass ) : at this point wimp annihilation heating dominates over all cooling mechanisms and prevents the further collapse of the star .",
    "we suggested that the very first stellar objects might be `` dark stars , '' a new phase of stellar evolution in which the dm  while only supplying @xmath14% of the mass density  provides the power source for the star through dm annihilation .",
    "we are as yet uncertain of the lifetime of these theoretical objects .",
    "it is possible that they last as long as 600 myr , which is the timescale for all the dm to annihilate away inside of the dark star ( neglecting refilling the region using dm from the halo outside of the dark star ) .",
    "this lifetime is as yet uncertain .",
    "the existence of dark stars depends on the fact that the dm densities in these protostars is sufficiently high for the dm annihilation heating to be significant .",
    "previously , we obtained estimates for the dm densities as follows : we started with a variety of initial density profiles laid down by gravitational collapse during hierarchical structure formation ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , and white profiles ) .",
    "these profiles were then compressed further due to the baryonic quasi - static contraction as the protostar cooled and collapsed . as the baryons come to dominate the potential well in the core , they pull the dm particles inward .",
    "previously we used the simple adiabatic contraction method of blumenthal _ etal _",
    "@xcite ( hereafter blumenthal method ) to estimate the resultant dm density profile .",
    "this method is extremely simplistic , in that it assumes all the halo particles move on circular orbits ; equivalently only their angular momentum is conserved as the halo is compressed .",
    "we found that this method gave a dm density at the outer edge of the baryonic core @xmath15 and scales as @xmath16 outside the core .",
    "however , a number of authors have compared the blumenthal method to @xmath17-body simulations of compressed haloes in other contexts ( galaxies ) , and warned that the predicted density profiles in those cases were more concentrated than found in their @xmath17-body simulations , especially in the crucial inner part @xcite .",
    "consequently there was some concern whether or not the dm densities used in our first paper on dark stars were badly overestimated , so that it remained unclear whether or not dm heating in the first protostellar objects is important .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that the dm density in the central core of the protostars does indeed grow high enough for the dm heating to overpower any cooling mechanism , thereby preventing the further collapse of the star and giving rise to a dark star powered by dm annihilation .",
    "we follow the approach of young ( 1980 ) who presented a general treatment of adiabatic compression of a spherical system .",
    "his formulation was originally to model the growth of a black hole in a spherical star cluster , but the method can be applied for any adiabatic change to a spherical potential . it has been used to study halo compression by wilson @xcite and independently by sellwood and mcgaugh@xcite in galaxies .",
    "the latter authors found that the simplistic blumenthal method overestimated the central densities in galaxies by factors of two or three , but * not * by several orders of magnitude , even when radial pressure and disk geometry are taken into account .",
    "here we apply young s method , as adapted by sellwood and mcgaugh , to protostellar pop iii objects in order to obtain the dm densities inside their cores .",
    "it is important to point out that young s adiabatic prescription is not at all sensitive to departures from sphericity - sellwood and mcgaugh @xcite showed that , for what concerns adiabatic contraction , even a flat disk could be well approximated as a sphere .",
    "we briefly mention here other previous work on dm annihilation in stars .",
    "previous work on dm annihilation powering stars has also been done in the context of high dm densities near the supermassive black holes in galactic centers , e.g. wimp burners @xcite and more generally @xcite . in another paper ,",
    "we considered the effects of dm annihilation on early zero - metallicity ( population iii ) stars , once they do have fusion inside their cores@xcite .",
    "a very similar work was simultaneously submitted by @xcite .",
    "these stars live inside a reservoir of wimps ; as the wimps move through the stars , some of the wimps are captured by the stars . the captured dm sinks to the center of the stars , where it adds to the dm annihilation .",
    "we found that dm annihilation may dominate over fusion , and the dm power source may exceed the eddington luminosity and prevent the first stars from growing beyond a limited mass .",
    "the dm profiles obtained in this paper are appropriate to _ any _ type of collisionless dm , not just wimps .",
    "this work relies upon the gravitational response of the halo to the baryons alone , and requires only that the dm particles are both collisionless and interact with the baryons only through gravitational forces .",
    "we also need to make an assumption about the velocity distribution of the dm particles in the very centers of these small halos , which we take to be isotropic .    the protostellar clouds ( unlike galaxies as a whole ) are baryon rich environments .",
    "for hydrogen density @xmath18@xmath19 , the baryon density exceeds the dm density in the collapsing protostar .",
    "we note that the angular momentum of the collapsing baryons is transferred to baryons via gas dynamics rather than being transferred to dark matter gravitationally . in section 2",
    ", we will review the various methods for halo compression . in section 3",
    ", we present our results in the first protostellar objects .",
    "then we conclude in section 4 .",
    "in this paper we assume adiabaticity of the protostellar collapse . in other words , since the change of the gravitational potential is not too substantial over a single orbital time scale during the phase we are studying , we may take the adiabatic invariants to be well conserved .      with this assumption of adiabaticity",
    ", we follow the response of the dm to the collapse of the protostellar object . as our initial conditions for the dm before contraction , we take an overdense region of @xmath20 with a navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) profile @xcite for both dm and gas , where the gas contribution is 15% of that of the dm . the density profile of an nfw halo is @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the break radius of the profile and @xmath24 sets the density scale .",
    "the critical density of the universe varies with redshift @xmath25 as @xmath26 the hubble parameter in a flat universe varies as @xmath27\\ ] ] where the current matter density is @xmath28 , and the @xmath29 term ( dark energy ) on the right hand side can be neglected at the redshifts we are considering .",
    "we find @xmath30 , where today s hubble constant @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "for an nfw halo of mass @xmath33 , and taking @xmath34 gives @xmath35pc . for a value of the concentration parameter @xmath36",
    ", we have @xmath37 pc .    for comparison",
    ", we also use the extreme case of a profile which has a constant density dm core in the inner region before contraction .    given these initial profiles for the dm",
    ", we can follow their response to the changing baryonic gravitational potential as the protostellar gas condenses .",
    "the gas density profiles during the protostellar collapse we use are taken from simulations of @xcite ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) . roughly , the profiles of the hydrogen number density have the functional form @xmath38 .",
    "the profile is flat from the origin out to ( almost ) @xmath39 , where it turns over to @xmath40 .",
    "the core densities @xmath41 and turnover radii @xmath39 are taken from @xcite .",
    "we note that the hydrogen number density should be multiplied by @xmath42 to obtain the total gas density , in order to account for the additional presence of helium in the collapsing protostellar cloud .",
    "below we will describe the results of adiabatic contraction for the dm that we previously obtained using the blumenthal method , and then turn to the more accurate young method to find better dm density profiles in the collapsing protostellar objects .",
    "we previously used the blumenthal method for adiabatic contraction @xcite to obtain estimates of the dm profile as the first protostars condensed .",
    "as mentioned previously , this method assumes that dm particles conserve angular momentum as the halo is compressed ( other adiabatic invariants set to zero ) ; i.e. , all particles are on circular orbits .",
    "one can assume that a particle at radius @xmath43 is pulled in to a radius @xmath44 .",
    "then one finds that @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the total mass inside radius @xmath47 and final quantities use the perturbed potential ( due to baryonic infall ) for their evaluation .",
    "additionally , the assumption is made that dissipationless particle orbits do not cross ( since particles are on circular orbits ) .",
    "after contraction , we found the dm density at the outer edge of the baryonic core is roughly given by eqn.([eq : blum ] ) and scales as @xmath48 outside the core .",
    "our results are shown in figure 1 .",
    "( blue dashed lines ) and @xmath49@xmath19 ( red dotted lines ) . for comparison ,",
    "the black dots show the dm densities obtained in the numerical simulations of @xcite ( see their figure 2a ) corresponding to @xmath50@xmath19 .",
    "excellent agreement is seen ; the outer profile for all cases scales as @xmath51 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one can compare our adiabatically contracted nfw profiles obtained via the blumenthal method with the dm profiles found numerically in  @xcite for the first collapsing protostellar clouds ( see their fig.2 ) . while these authors obtained remarkably good density profiles for the collapsing protostellar gas in to very small radii , they found dm density profiles only up to radii that are several orders of magnitude larger in extent .",
    "in their paper they presented two dm profiles ( their earliest and latest profiles ) , for @xmath52 and @xmath53 as far inward as @xmath54pc and @xmath55pc respectively .",
    "the slope of these two curves is the same as ours , @xmath16 .",
    "if one uses this slope and extrapolates inward to smaller radii and to higher densities , then one obtains the same dm densities as with our adiabatic contraction approach , as seen in figure 1 .",
    "although we are encouraged by this agreement , one might still worry about the extrapolation of the dm in toward radii smaller than the ones treated by @xcite .",
    "hence it is the purpose of this paper to improve upon the blumenthal approximations used in paper i and to obtain better estimates of the dm density profiles inside the collapsing baryonic core in the first protostars .",
    "we note that @xmath17-body simulations ( without assuming adiabaticity ) to further confirm the dm profiles obtained in this work after baryonic compression are in progress @xcite .      as discussed in section 3.6 of binney and tremaine @xcite",
    ", adiabatic changes conserve all three actions of an orbit . in this paper",
    "we do indeed work with the assumption that the growth of the protostellar object is adiabatic .",
    "in general , if no further assumptions are made , one needs to consider all three actions , and the problem becomes intractable analytically , though it can still be followed with @xmath17-body simulations . in a spherical system , however , the problem reduces to two conserved actions and becomes tractable : these two actions are the angular momentum and radial action , while the third action is identically zero because the plane of each orbit is an invariant .",
    "thus adiabatic compression of a spherical halo needs to take account of the conservation of radial action , as well as of angular momentum . whereas blumenthal s method makes the further restriction of only circular orbits",
    "so that only angular momentum is conserved , young @xcite described an algorithm to take into account conservation of both of these two adiabatic invariants .",
    "the central idea of his method is to require the distribution function to be invariant during adiabatic changes : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the radial action and @xmath58 is the azimuthal action , or total angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "here subscripts @xmath59 and @xmath60 refer to initial and new halo profiles , computed in the changing potential well due to baryonic infall .",
    "sellwood and mcgaugh@xcite implemented young s method for halo compression in galaxies ( see also wilson @xcite ) . in their paper",
    ", they describe an iterative procedure for obtaining a dm density profile in response to a baryonic mass inside the halo that condenses .",
    "they focused on a growing disk inside a galaxy , and the consequent dm particle compression in the central region of the galaxy .",
    "they showed that young s prescription was successful ( matched numerical results ) even for a flat disk ; indeed the method is not restricted in practice to spherical systems . in the present paper the code of sellwood and mcgaugh",
    "is applied to the problem of the first protostars , with this same iterative procedure following the compression of the dm halo as the protostellar core collapses .",
    "the method works by relating the distribution function of the compressed halo to that of the original halo through the two conserved actions , assuming the compression is adiabatic .",
    "it is therefore necessary to compute ( 1 ) the radial action from the energy and angular momentum in the compressed potential , and then ( 2 ) the energy in the original halo for the same radial action and angular momentum .",
    "a numerically efficient procedure is to interpolate from tables of these quantities , and the radial action table for step ( 1 ) has to be recomputed at each iteration .",
    "since the first stars are much smaller , relative to the nfw halo break radius , than the galaxy disks used in the previous application , we increased the sizes of the tables to @xmath61 values in order to achieve the desired precision .",
    "the final density profile generally converged satisfactorily in a few , typically 3 or 4 , iterations .",
    "we find the adiabatic contraction of dm densities due to the collapsing gas densities in the inner regions of the first collapsing protostellar clouds .",
    "our results can be seen in figures 2 and 3 as well as table 1 .",
    "we can start from an initial nfw halo profile for both the dm and the baryons , with the baryons comprising 15% of the total mass .",
    "starting from initial nfw haloes ( dashed line in the figure ) , fig .",
    "2 plots contracted density profiles using ( a ) the standard blumenthal method for adiabatic contraction ( dotted lines ) and ( b ) the young method ( solid lines ) , for a variety of hydrogen densities , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for a total dm halo mass of @xmath64 and a concentration parameter @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "the upper panel illustrates the dark matter density profile and the lower panel illustrates the enclosed dm mass @xmath46 as a function of radius .",
    "both profiles are shown in to a radius of @xmath67pc .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : expparam ]    , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the upper panel shows the resultant dm density profiles , and the lower panel shows the enclosed dm mass as a function of radius .",
    "the four sets of curves in each panel correspond to a baryonic core density of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "our main result is that the two different approaches to obtaining the dm densities find values that differ by less than a factor of two .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the main result of our paper is that the densities computed in both ways differ by no more than a factor of 2 . in some cases",
    "the blumenthal method yields a higher density , while in other cases the young method yields a higher density ; yet the difference never exceeds a factor of two .",
    "one can see that the dm density is not enhanced at small radii for low gas density @xmath70@xmath19 ; this is because the amount of gas mass at these radii is simply too small . however , once the protostellar cloud gets to @xmath71@xmath19 or higher , the dm density is substantially enhanced due to adiabatic contraction using either method .",
    "one might also ask why the blumenthal formula yields a lower predicted density than young s formula at small radii , as the plot shows for the two lower density stars .",
    "the answer is that a halo particle on a non - circular orbit spends part of its time at large radii where the interior compressing mass is larger than when it is close to the center .",
    "thus the mean density can be increased even when little compressing mass is interior to that radius - this can happen only where the star has a diffuse core .",
    "we note that the curves for @xmath72@xmath19 do not look substantially different from those of @xmath73@xmath19 .",
    "this is because at the radius of @xmath67pc , the two curves are just beginning to diverge . at smaller radii , the higher gas density would lead to substantially higher dm density ; i.e. , we expect that the dm density for the @xmath74@xmath19 curve would be much higher than that for the @xmath75@xmath19 curve at a radius of @xmath76pc , but we do not have the resolution to show this explicitly . in short , starting from an nfw profile , we have confirmed that the dm density in the inner regions of the protostellar cloud is substantially enhanced due to contraction during gas collapse .",
    "figure 3 plots the contracted density profiles obtained with the same two techniques , but starting from a dm core as the initial condition . to be extremely conservative ,",
    "we take as our initial core dm density @xmath77 ( with a core radius of @xmath78pc ) .",
    "this value is motivated by the dm density found by @xcite ( see fig 2a ) corresponding to a hydrogen density of @xmath79@xmath19 ; their numerical results were found only in to a radius @xmath80pc , and we simply take the value they found near that radius to be constant inward all the way to the origin . clearly , this gives an underestimate of the initial dm density in the central region of the dm halo .",
    "even in this case , the dm density is substantially enhanced by the subsequent gas collapse .",
    "this initial profile is not meant to be realistic and is presented merely as an extremely conservative illustration of the two techniques for obtaining the dm density profile . in figure 3 , the three curves correspond to hydrogen densities @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the upper panel illustrates the resultant dm profiles and the lower panel illustrates the enclosed dm mass as a function of radius .",
    "again , the dm density is substantially enhanced due to contraction during gas collapse .",
    "we note that , on the smallest scales and highest densities ( the @xmath75 cored case ) , the plots look irregular ( particularly on logarithmic scales ) due to a sparse numerical grid , which has fewer points in the inner region for this cored case .     and @xmath83 .",
    "this initial profile is not considered to be realistic in dark matter haloes and is presented merely as an illustration of the two techniques .",
    "[ the kink in the highest density case at small radii using the young method is not to be taken seriously , as it is an artifact due to numerical uncertainties significant only for this highest density cored case at small radii .",
    "] , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    our general conclusion is that dm densities are indeed substantially enhanced in the presence of the collapsing baryonic protostellar cloud . due to the resultant large dm densities ,",
    "the dm heating becomes substantial and the dark star proposed in paper i does indeed come into existence at this point .",
    "as the first stars form inside dm haloes , the protostellar baryons gravitationally pull the dm farther inward .",
    "our results hold regardless of the nature of the dark matter : simply due to gravity , the density of any type of dark matter in the inner regions of the collapsing population iii protostars will be enhanced by the baryonic infall . in this paper",
    "we computed the changes to the dm density profile in the protostellar cores due to adiabatic increase of gas densities in these cores .",
    "we used young s method appropriate for spherical halos , which takes into account conservation of both angular momentum and the radial action . with this method we found dm density profiles after contraction with central densities no more than a factor of two different than those obtained previously @xcite via a simple blumenthal model for adiabatic contraction ( which takes into account only circular orbits )",
    "the central dm densities in the protostar are substantially enhanced during the gas collapse .",
    "note that the compressed halo densities we obtain when we assume either that halo particles have entirely circular orbits or an isotropic velocity distribution do not differ by much ; we do not therefore expect our conclusions to be at all sensitive to any assumption for the distribution of halo particle velocities .",
