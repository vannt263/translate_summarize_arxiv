    "the standard model ( sm ) provides an elegant mechanism by which the massive intermediate vector bosons @xmath0 and @xmath1 acquire mass while the photon and gluons remain massless . postulating the higgs field to transform as a singlet under @xmath2 and a doublet under @xmath3 , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses at tree level",
    "are given in terms of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and only one dimensionful parameter @xmath6 gev .",
    "the sm does not provide such an economical explanation for the observed fermion masses .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the quark mass term in the lagrangian reads @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are arbitrary @xmath9 complex yukawa coupling matrices .",
    "some predictive mechanism for fermion mass generation is needed so as to place the understanding of fermion mass on a par with that of gauge boson mass ; i.e. , to find an overriding principle that predicts the values of the quark and lepton mass matrix elements to be what they are .",
    "another failing of the sm is that of explaining in a natural way the existence of a light fundamental higgs mass scale in comparison to the planck scale , the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "traditional proposed solutions have been technicolor and supersymmetry , while recently it has been suggested that large extra dimensions ( led ) may result in a change in how gravity behaves at high energies and thus allow room for only one fundamental scale in physics , the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "however , this suggestion in its simplest forms does not really address the gauge hierarchy problem , but rather transforms it into a problem of disparate length scales .",
    "one needs to explain why the extra dimensions are so large .",
    "randall and sundrum observed that if there are in fact extra dimensions , our world is necessarily confined to a four dimensional submanifold , a 3-brane  @xcite .",
    "it is then apparent that any 3-branes living in extra dimensions must be taken into account when determining the metric .",
    "the imposition of four - dimensional poincare invariance generically results in a non - facorizable geometry with an associated warp factor . unlike in the led scenarios ,",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem is resolved not with the single fundamental scale being the tev scale , but with the fundamental scale being the planck scale .",
    "particle physics scales of 1 tev are reproduced after taking into account the effect of the warp factor on the visible brane and canonically normalizing the higgs field , so that a higgs vev @xmath10 gev may result even if the fundamental @xmath11 is of the order of the planck scale .    in this paper",
    ", we ask the question `` can the gauge hierarchy problem and the quark mass hierarachy be simultaneously explained in a minimal extension of the randall - sundrum solution ? '' . in a recent paper  @xcite",
    ", we used the lykken - randall scenario  @xcite of one hidden , positive tension brane located at the origin in a non - compact extra dimension . treating as probes the branes where the sm fields are localized , we found that a phenomenologically acceptable quark mass spectrum results , but that the mixing parameters were inconsistent with experiment . taking this discrepency as a signal for a more rigorous treatment ,",
    "we refine the previous calculation . using the full metric as determined by all the branes , including the previously dubbed probe branes , we solve exactly for the fermion field profile in the extra compact dimension .",
    "this new implementation of the same essential mechanism as in @xcite is much more restrictive , and yet we still find the quark mass spectrum can be successfully produced and the gauge hierarchy problem resolved .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the many - brane extension of the randall - sundrum solution @xcite and solve for the profile of a massless fundamental five - dimensional fermion field in this geometry , as outlined in bajc and gabadadze @xcite . in section iii",
    ", we present our mechanism of a gravitational origin of quark masses , made possible by the identification of different sm flavors with the peaked profile of one fundmental field around different branes .",
    "this idea of localizing different flavors at different locations in higher - dimensional geography has been exploited recently in @xcite .",
    "we present an example justifying our claim that variants of the rs scenario are capable of successfully addressing both hierarchies mentioned above .",
    "finally , we generalize the goldberger - wise mechanism of modulus stabilization with bulk fields to the multi - brane system under consideration .",
    "we then draw our conclusions and briefly mention further directions currently under investigation .",
    "in @xcite , hatanaka et al . have generalized the orginal rs solution with an @xmath12 compact extra dimension to the case of many branes .",
    "the general configuration considered is that of @xmath13 parallel 3-branes in five spacetime dimensions such that the @xmath14 3-brane located at @xmath15 has tension @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this more general configuration allows for the possibility of different inter - brane bulk cosomological constants , and so the entire action may be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 \\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the resulting five dimensional einstein equations are @xmath23 \\sqrt{g } g_{mn } \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath24\\ ] ] taking the same form for the metric anstze as in the original rs scenario so as to preserve four dimensional poincare invariance , @xmath25 one finds the solution @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath12 periodicity @xmath28 requires @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 for @xmath17 and @xmath32 .",
    "given this general metric , we now wish to couple a fundamental , massless five - dimensional fermion field to it and solve for its profile in the bulk . in @xcite ,",
    "bajc and gabadadze showed that massless fermions can be localized around a single negative tension brane , but that no normalizable solution exists in the case of a single positive tension brane when the extra dimension is non - compact .",
    "however , in the case of a compact extra dimension , both negative and positive tension branes may exist and the fermion profile in the bulk will have local maxima around the negative tension branes and local minima around the positive tension branes .    switching notation so that the extra dimension is parametrized by @xmath33 @xmath34 , we work with the configuration of twentyfour branes all with the same magnitude of tension , such that @xmath35    where @xmath36 as @xmath37 is even or odd and @xmath38 where @xmath39 as @xmath37 is even or odd .    given this metric , the properly normalized massless fermion field profile in the bulk",
    "is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the effective newton constant is given by @xmath42 @xmath43\\ ] ] and so is of the order @xmath44 for every brane .",
    "hence the @xmath45 can be chosen so as to generate an acceptable quark mass spectrum without conflicting with the observed strength of gravity .",
    "we note that our multi - brane set - up is a specific example of the so - called brane - crystals as recently investigated by kaloper @xcite .",
    "as in @xcite , we may naturally define an effective four - dimensional pair of quark mass matrices as @xmath46 up and down quark sector mass matrices may then be evaluated once we adopt a particular brane number - sm field dictionary . separating left and right - handed components",
    ", we may identify brane number and flavor as @xmath47 .",
    "different flavors are identified with different local maxima of the fermion field in the extra dimension .",
    "we now show an example supporting our claim that this geometry allows for a simultaneous taming of the two mass hierarchy problems . working in units of the planck mass ,",
    "we choose the fundamental parameters as follows : @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the position of the first brane is at the origin of the compact dimension , @xmath51 .",
    "we then place the remaining branes at equal coordinate intervals further out in the @xmath33 direction . in this example",
    ", we choose @xmath52 .",
    "no new hierarchy is introduced , as @xmath53 is caculated to be @xmath54 planck lengths .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "( 1 ) a plot of the function @xmath55 of eq .  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "the original rs scenario would provide the same picture up to @xmath56 , the position of the first negative tension brane . in this case",

    "we see that the peaks associated with the lighter flavors have a markedly higher profile than those associated with the heavier flavors . within the context of our proposed mechanism for quark mass generation ,",
    "this observation makes perfect sense .",

    "flavor mixing does not arise from the diagonalization of four dimensional quark mass matrices , but rather from wave function overlap , as in @xcite .",
    "as one may readily verify , varying the @xmath45 and the other fundamental parameters by factors of the order of 2 , or even relaxing the aestheticly pleasing requirements of equal magnitudes for the brane tensions and equal coordinate spacings for the brane positions in the extra dimension , one can indeed successfully produce a quark mass spectrum in all but perfect agreement with experimental observation .",
    "this variation may require some degree of moderate fine - tuning , but nothing like the fine - tuning associated with the gauge hierarchy problem within the context of the pure sm .",
    "because the positions of the various branes are of crucial importance to the above analysis , it is necessary to investigate how the branes can be stabilized at these positions in such a way that no new hierarchy is introduced . in the orginal rs scenario , @xmath71 is taken to be the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field . because this scalar field did not have an associated potential , it was not clear that the size of the extra dimensions would be stable .",

    "the first issue is that of the stability of the brane coordinates , which enter strongly into the determination of the mass eigenvalues .",
    "presumably , the simple generalization of the goldberger - wise mechanism could account for their stability .",
    "a more sophisticated explanation would not only account for their stability , but for the actual values needed to produce an acceptable mass spectrum .",
    "an additional point that needs to be addressed is our model s lack of cp violation .",
    "as is known , the sm mechanism for cp violation via a physically meaningful phase in the ckm matrix does not provide enough cp violation for the purposes of baryogenesis .",
    "perhaps the source of cp violation and the origin of quark masses are different problems . to conclude , the rs scenario provides an intriguing resolution of the hierarchy problem .",
    "we find suggestive evidence that it may address the fermion mass hierarchy as well .",
    "mass being the charge of spacetime - matter interactions , it seems only natural that the fermion mass hierarchy will be understood in terms of spacetime considerations as opposed to an internal flavor symmetry governing yukawa - type interactions .",
