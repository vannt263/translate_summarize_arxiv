    "the nature of molecular cloud turbulence is still poorly understood and no simple conceptual theory exists akin to that of kolmogorov s phenomenology for turbulence in fluids .",
    "two major complications are _ strong compressibility _ of interstellar gas mediated by radiative energy losses and presence of dynamically important _ magnetic fields_. while these two factors bring into play additional variables and equations rendering the modeling hardly tractable analytically and complicating numerical analysis , the nature of underlying nonlinearity contained in the advection terms remains the same . from a mathematician s perspective",
    ", the general problem is essentially the same as in the navier - stokes turbulence , one of the remaining six unsolved millennium prize problems for which the clay institute of mathematics is offering a bonus of $ 1 million .",
    "thus hopes to find universality in interstellar turbulence are not entirely unfounded , see e.g. @xcite , although some researchers believe that breakdown of universality in incompressible isotropic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence is possible , e.g. due to nonlocality of interactions @xcite .",
    "the supersonic regime typical of mc turbulence is extremely hard to achieve in the laboratory and the information available from astronomical observations is rather limited @xcite .",
    "this makes numerical simulations , perhaps , the only tool available to explore the statistics of supersonic turbulence in detail .",
    "high dynamic range simulations can shed light on the energy transfer between scales and on the key spatial correlations of the relevant fields in these flows only if they provide sufficient scale separation to resolve the dynamics of prevailing nonlinear interactions in the inertial range .",
    "in addition , low numerical dissipation and high - order numerical methods for three - dimensional compressible mhd are needed to achieve an accurate description of the inertial range of supersonic turbulence .",
    "stable , accurate , divergence - free simulation of magnetized supersonic turbulence is a severe test of numerical mhd schemes and has been surprisingly difficult to achieve due to the range of flow conditions present . over the last two years we have developed piecewise parabolic method on a local stencil ( ppml ) , a new higher order - accurate , low dissipation numerical method which requires no additional dissipation or local `` fixes '' for stable execution @xcite .",
    "ppml is a local stencil variant of the popular ppm algorithm @xcite for solving the equations of compressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "the principal difference between ppml and ppm is that cell interface states are `` evolved '' rather that reconstructed at every timestep , resulting in a compact stencil .",
    "interface states are evolved using riemann invariants containing all transverse derivative information .",
    "the scheme is fully multidimensional as the conservation laws are updated in an unsplit fashion , including the terms corresponding to the tangential directions in the amplitude equations .",
    "this helps to avoid numerous well - known pathologies , such as `` carbuncles '' , etc . @xcite .",
    "divergence - free evolution of the magnetic field is maintained using the higher order - accurate constrained transport technique @xcite .",
    "the low dissipation and wide spectral bandwidth of this method make it an ideal choice for direct simulations of compressible turbulence .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we reported results from a set of three simulations of driven isothermal supersonic turbulence at a sonic mach number of 10 on @xmath2 meshes demonstrating the performance of our ppml solver on models with different degrees of magnetization from super - alfvnic through trans - alfvnic regimes .",
    "turbulence statistics derived from these three - dimensional models show that the density , velocity , and magnetic energy spectra vary strongly with the strength of turbulent magnetic field fluctuations . at the same time",
    ", the three cases suggest that a linear scaling in the 4/3-law of incompressible mhd turbulence @xcite is preserved even in the strongly compressible regime at @xmath3 , if the proper density weighting is applied to the elssser fields following the 1/3-rule introduced in refs .",

    "we use this set of simulations to check the ( self-)convergence rates for various statistical measures with improved grid resolution .",
    "we also confirm the universal linear scaling for the mixed third - order structure functions of modified elssser fields discussed earlier in @xcite .",

    "a fixed large - scale ( @xmath16 ) isotropic nonhelical solenoidal force @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the acceleration and @xmath19 indicates averaging over the entire computational domain , is used to stir the gas keeping @xmath20 close to 10 during the simulation .",
    "the models are initiated with a uniform density @xmath21 , large - scale velocity field @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a constant such that @xmath24 , and a uniform magnetic field @xmath25 aligned with the @xmath26-coordinate direction .",
    "the magnetic field strength is parameterized by the ratio of thermal - to - magnetic pressure @xmath27 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we carried out three pilot simulations with @xmath28 , 2 , and 20 at @xmath2 . here",

    "our numerical experiments covered the transition to turbulence and evolution for up to eight dynamical times , @xmath30 .",
    "the magnetic field was not forced and receives energy passively through interaction with the velocity field . this random",
    "forcing does not generate a mean field , but still leads to amplification of the small - scale magnetic energy through compression in shocks in combination with flux freezing and , possibly to some extent , via a process known as small - scale dynamo , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",

    "this is far from the realistic values for the interstellar conditions , where @xmath32 .",

    "white - blue - yellow colors correspond to low - intermediate - high projected density values .",
    "the dynamic range of the image is about 100 . ]    after the initial stir - up phase , our simulations reach a statistical steady state . a snapshot of the projected ( column ) density in such a saturated state is shown in fig .  [ project ] .",
    "the morphology of structures visible in this projected density distribution is surprisingly similar to that from a non - magnetized simulation at @xmath36 presented in fig .  1 . of ref .",
    "@xcite , even though the power spectrum index is about @xmath37 here ( see section  [ scal].1 and fig .",
    "[ figfour]*d * ) and @xmath38 there ( see fig .",
    "2*a * in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the morphology of the density distribution in thin slices ( not shown ) is clearly different .",
    "this illustrates the loss of information in the projection procedure that makes it difficult to measure physical parameters of supersonic turbulent flows from the observed projected density distributions alone .",
    "the properties of this saturated state representing fully developed macroscopically isotropic compressible mhd turbulence are the main focus of this paper . while some level of physical understanding of small - scale rms field amplification and its saturation exists , the structure of the saturated state is poorly known , even in the incompressible case @xcite .",
    "we compared the saturation levels for several integral characteristics of turbulence for models with three different resolutions : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 . since in the @xmath29 case",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath39 dominates over the magnetic energy @xmath40 by a factor of about 3 , it is practical to consider @xmath41 and @xmath42 separately instead of concentrating on the total energy @xmath43 .",
    "figure  [ figthree]*a * shows that the kinetic energy is already converged on @xmath1 grids , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the saturation level of magnetic energy at @xmath29 clearly depends on the grid resolution and there are good chances that convergence can be reached already at resolution of @xmath44 cells .",
    "the mean values of @xmath42 for @xmath45 $ ] are 10.0 , 12.3 , and 13.5 with the highest corresponding to our finest grid resolution of @xmath0 .",
    "the lack of convergence in @xmath42 stems from numerical diffusion suppressing small - scale compressions and also the small - scale dynamo action , if any , in low - resolution runs .",
    "the mean value of @xmath41 for the same averaging interval is 39.8 , thus the magnetic energy contributes about one quarter of the total energy , @xmath46 , in the @xmath0 model .    while the root mean square ( rms ) sonic mach number @xmath20 saturates at a level of about 9.2 independent of the grid resolution , the alfvn mach number @xmath47 , 3.1 , and 2.8 for grids with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 cells , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ figthree]*b * ) . with the same initial uniform field @xmath48",
    ", we get turbulent states with slightly different @xmath49 values with a tendency towards less super - alfvnic flows at higher grid resolutions .",
    "since we do not include the explicit dissipative terms in the equations we integrate numerically , the dissipation in our models is purely numerical and the higher resolution models correspond to higher effective reynolds numbers . ) and ( [ fara ] ) would require a much higher grid resolution to obtain an equivalent scale separation .",
    "] this can be traced in the non - converging levels of rms helicity gradually growing with higher grid resolution , see fig .",
    "[ figthree]*c*. since our driving force is non - helical to a very good approximation , the mean helicity stays close to zero over the course of a simulation .",
    "figure  [ figthree]*d * shows a rather slow convergence in the levels of the rms cross - helicity and finite deviations of the mean cross - helicity @xmath50 from zero in low resolution runs .",
    "ppml does not exactly conserve cross - helicity , even though it is one of the ideal invariants in mhd .",
    "the normalized mean cross - helicity is , however , contained within @xmath51% for @xmath29 at @xmath0 .",
    "even though both the kinetic and the magnetic energy as well as the rms alfvn mach number reach saturation after about 3 dynamical times of evolution in our models with @xmath29 , the rms cross - helicity continues to grow slowly for up to 4 or even 5 dynamical times meaning that stirring the flow for @xmath52 might not be sufficient to reach a statistical steady state .",
    "another global diagnostic to look at is the rms density . in models with higher resolution",
    "the flow is better resolved and higher level of density fluctuations is observed .",
    "the rms denstity is , however , not very sensitive to the grid resolution and changes from 2.2 to 2.3 as the resolution jumps from @xmath1 to @xmath0 , see fig .",
    "[ figthree]*e*.    finally , to illustrate the convergence of spectral properties of turbulent fluctuations , in fig .",
    "[ figthree]*f , g * , and * h * we show compensated power spectra of the density , the velocity , and the magnetic field for a set of snapshots from simulations with different resolutions taken early in the saturated state at @xmath53 . the velocity spectra can be used to access the spectral bandwidth of ppml .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ figthree]*g * , the velocity spectrum is resolved up to @xmath54 at @xmath1 and up to @xmath55 at @xmath2 , consistent with the grid refinement by a factor of two .",
    "here we present time - averaged statistics for our highest resolution @xmath29 model at @xmath0 grid cells and compare these with our previous results for non - magnetized ( hd ) simulations at @xmath36 and grid resolutions of @xmath0 and @xmath44 cells @xcite .",
    "our mhd data are based on 100 full data snapshots equally spaced in time for @xmath56t_d$ ] , i.e. we do the averaging over five dynamical times which makes it , perhaps , the best available sample for compressible mhd turbulence at this resolution .",
    "our projected density spectra are based on a sample of 750 projections , including all three projection directions , covering the same time span @xmath56t_d$ ] .",
    "we first begin with the scaling properties of the basic fields , such as the density , velocity , and magnetic field and then discuss ideal invariants , such as the total energy and the energy transfer rate that may or may not display universal behavior .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of the gas density is one of the most important inputs for the theories of star formation in molecular clouds as it determines the amount of the dense material available for gravitational collapse to form stars @xcite .",
    "the ability to predict the pdf is important in other extreme astrophysical environments , such as , e.g. , accretion onto `` seed '' black holes in the first galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is also known as one of the most robust statistical characteristics for compressible isothermal turbulence as its lognormal shape @xcite gets quickly established in numerical simulations , e.g. @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate the lognormal form of the pdf in our @xmath29 model which gives a perfect fit for a range of @xmath34 in probability at high densities ( fig .",
    "[ figfour]*a * ) . compared to the unmagnetized cases at @xmath36 studied in @xcite ,",
    "the lognormal distribution in the mhd case with @xmath3 is , as expected at higher mach numbers , somewhat wider .",
    "if we parametrize the standard deviation @xmath57 as a function of the rms sonic mach number , @xmath58 , we get @xmath59 and 0.27 as the best fit values for @xmath60 $ ] in the mhd and hd cases , respectively .",
    "the mean of the distrubution is also a function of the standard deviation , @xmath61 . for more detail on the dependence of the pdf on the value of @xmath62",
    "see @xcite .    the density power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ figfour]*b * ) scales roughly as @xmath63 , shallower than the slope of @xmath64 in the hd case at a smaller @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of the logarithm of density ( fig .",
    "[ figfour]*c * ) scales somewhat steeper , @xmath65 , but still shallower than @xmath66 found at @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of the logarithm of projected gas density roughly follows the scaling @xmath67 , which is somewhat steeper than the scaling of the density power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ figfour]*d * ) , but still shallower than @xmath68 measured for the hd case at @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the density spectra to the value of @xmath62 is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the velocity power spectrum as well as the results of the helmholtz decomposition of the velocity @xmath10 into the solenoidal ( @xmath69 ) and dilatational ( @xmath70 ) parts , @xmath71 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ figfour]*e*. the velocity power index is very close to @xmath72 at @xmath73 around 30 , the value proposed for an isotropic incompressible case with turbulent energy equipartition @xcite , and the spectrum is dominated by the solenoidal component which follows the same scaling .",
    "note that in the hd simulation of ref .",
    "@xcite this range of wavenumbers is buried under the bottleneck bump which is known to be much weaker , if exists at all , in the mhd models . at lower wavenumbers ( but still within the inertial range ) , the velocity spectrum tends to get steeper , as should be expected for a strongly supersonic regime .",
    "the spectrum for the dilatational component of velocity is generally slightly steeper , as was previously reported for non - magnetized turbulence @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figfour]*f * compares the fraction of dilatational component in the velocity power , @xmath74 , from our ppml mhd model at @xmath29 with those in our previous ppm @xmath36 hd runs at resolutions of @xmath0 and @xmath44 cells @xcite . in both hd runs @xmath75 in the inertial range , even though we used different driving forces and different parameterizations for ppm diffusion in these simulations .",
    "the fact that @xmath76 tends to be close to @xmath77 in isotropic flows at high mach numbers can be explained by purely geometric considerations . at the same time , in our mhd model @xmath78 or even somewhat lower . a lower mean level of saturation for @xmath76 in magnetized flows at high mach numbers can be explained by the additional magnetic pressure term in the momentum conservation equation .",
    "a similar value for @xmath76 was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for a model with stronger field ( @xmath79 ) at the same grid resolution , cf .",
    "the @xmath80-compensated power spectra of dilatational velocities in fig .",
    "14 of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , demonstrate an unusual rise of power near the nyquist frequency that we do not observe in our simulations with ppml .",
    "neither do we see such rise in our hd models with ppm ( fig .",
    "[ figfour]*e * ) .",
    "the origin of this sharp rise in compressions at high wavenumbers in simulations with the _ athena _ code @xcite is unclear .      since the total energy @xmath81 is a conserved quantity , it is instructive to follow its distribution as a function of scale , @xmath82 $ ] , see fig .",
    "[ figfour]*g*. it appears that to a good approximation the total energy follows a simple scaling law @xmath83 .",
    "it is hard to believe , though , that this scaling exponent is universal .",
    "we have shown that in non - magnetized turbulence the power index for @xmath84 does depend on the rms mach number of the flow @xcite . in mhd models ,",
    "the scaling of @xmath85 would also depend on the saturation level of the magnetic energy .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to see how a combination of the magnetic and kinetic energy , each of which do not display a clear extended scaling range ( fig .",
    "[ figfour]*g * ) add up to result in an extended flat stretch of the total energy spectrum .",
    "is this coincidental ? or is this a result of self - organization in supersonic super - alfvnic mhd turbulence ?    a better candidate for universal",
    "scaling is the energy transfer rate .",
    "indeed , our hd simulations have shown that @xmath86 follows the kolmogorov @xmath66 scaling at @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "there is a set of exact scaling laws for homogeneous and isotropic incompressible mhd turbulence analogous to the 4/5-law of kolmogorov for ordinary turbulence in neutral fluids @xcite .",
    "the mhd laws can be expressed in terms of elssser fields , @xmath87 @xcite , as @xmath88 ^ 2\\right>=-\\frac{4}{d}\\epsilon^{\\pm}\\ell$ ] , where @xmath89\\cdot{\\bf \\hat{e}}$ ] , @xmath90 is the space dimension , @xmath91 is a unit vector with arbitrary direction , @xmath92 is the displacement vector , the brackets denote an ensemble average , and summation over repeated indices is implied .",
    "equivalently , the scaling laws can be rewritten in terms of the basic fields ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , but in mhd there are no separate _ exact _",
    "laws for the velocity or the magnetic field alone .",
    "it is important not to neglect the correlations between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 fields or @xmath93 and @xmath94 fields constrained by the invariance properties of the equations in turbulent cascade models . in supersonic turbulence",
    ", it is equally important to properly account for the density  velocity and density  magnetic field correlations .",
    "in incompressible mhd , the total energy @xmath81 and the cross - helicity @xmath95 play the role of ideal invariants and , thus , the ( total ) energy transfer rate @xmath96 and the cross - helicity transfer rate @xmath97 . for vanishing magnetic field @xmath11 ,",
    "one recovers the kolmogorov 4/5-law , @xmath98 ^ 3\\right>=-4/5\\epsilon\\ell$ ] , where @xmath99 is the mean rate of kinetic energy transfer @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations generally confirm these incompressible scalings , although the reynolds numbers are perhaps still too small to reproduce the asymptotic linear behavior with a desired precision and the results are sensitive to statistical errors @xcite .",
    "often , the absolute value of the longitudinal difference is used and still a linear scaling is recovered numerically , while there is no rigorous result for the normalization constant in this case .",
    "the third - order transverse velocity structure functions also show a linear scaling in simulations of nonmagnetized turbulence @xcite and the difference of scaling exponents for longitudinal and transverse structure functions can serve as a robust measure of statistical uncertainty of the computed exponents @xcite . in mhd simulations ,",
    "the third - order structure functions of the elssser fields @xmath100 were shown to have an approximately linear scaling too @xcite , but again there is no reason for this result to universally hold in all situations since the correlations between the @xmath101 fields play an important role in nonlinear transfer processes .",
    "can the 4/3-law for incompressible mhd turbulence be extended to supersonic regimes in molecular clouds ? as we discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a proper density weighting of the velocity , @xmath102 , preserves the approximately linear scaling of the third - order structure functions at high mach numbers in the nonmagnetized case ( for a more involved approach to density weighting see ref .",
    "it is straightforward to redefine the elssser fields for compressible flows using this `` 1/3-rule '' , @xmath103 , so that they match the original @xmath101 fields in the incompressible limit and reduce to @xmath102 in the limit of vanishing @xmath11 .",
    "the new @xmath104 fields can have universal scaling properties in homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows with a broad range of sonic and alfvnic mach numbers .",
    "we use data from our @xmath0 mhd simulation to support the conjecture proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and compute the third - order structure functions @xmath105 and @xmath106 defined above using the @xmath104 fields . since we are interested in the energy transfer through the inertial interval , we compute the sum of @xmath107 and @xmath108 which determines the energy transfer rate @xmath109 in the incompressible limit . to further reduce statistical errors ,",
    "we combine the transverse and longitudinal structure functions , but the absolute value operator was not applied to the field differences .",
    "figure  [ figfour]*h * shows the compensated scaling for @xmath110 averaged over 100 flow snapshots and the best linear fit @xmath111 for @xmath112 $ ] . for comparison , we overplot data from our @xmath2 simulation discussed in ref .",
    "clearly , at @xmath0 , we get a more extended scaling range and confirm the linear scaling found in @xcite .",
    "howefer , further work is needed to verify this result with high resolution simulations at different levels of magnetization .",
    "we verified the applicability of the 1/3-rule of hydrodynamic supersonic turbulence to super - alfvnic regimes of mhd turbulence using data from a new simulation with the piecewise parabolic method on a local stencil on a grid of @xmath0 cells .",
