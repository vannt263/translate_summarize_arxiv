    "the unusual properties of the condensed phases of helium have turned this substance into one of the most studied in the literature .",
    "an example is the fact that helium does not exhibit a solid phase at ambient pressure , not even at temperatures tending to absolute zero .",
    "this is due to the weak interactions between the helium atoms and the large zero - point motion .",
    "accordingly , only the application of a significant external pressure , of the order of 25 atm , allows the formation of a stable solid phase .",
    "the high - pressure solid phase of @xmath0he has recently become the subject of intensive investigation after the experimental observations of nonclassical rotational inertia ( ncri )  @xcite and unexpected mechanical behavior .",
    "@xcite    although @xmath0he s liquid phase and its display of the phenomenon of superfluidity are comparatively well understood , the comprehension of its solid counterpart involves more subtle issues that are not so easily grasped ( for a recent review see ref .  ) .",
    "this is reflected , for instance , in the fact that the origin of the observed ncri continues to be a subject of debate .",
    "a possible interpretation of this phenomenon is the existence of a supersolid phase , which presents the long - range order and spontaneous translational and rotational symmetry breaking characteristic of a solid but displaying superfluid - like behavior .",
    "the pioneering theoretical proposals of a @xmath0he supersolid phase  @xcite predict that vacancies are required for quantum crystals to exhibit superfluid behavior . more recently , despite of some controversy ,  @xcite there is evidence  @xcite that vacancies can indeed exist at zero temperature and that they may play a role in the observed ncri .    in view of the possible role of lattice vacancies in the unusual behavior of solid @xmath0he , it is of interest to estimate their zero - temperature equilibrium concentrations .",
    "given that experimental estimates are not yet available , we need to resort to purely theoretical methods .",
    "hodgdon and stillinger  @xcite were the first to conduct such an effort , taking advantage of the well - known isomorphism between a quantum - mechanical system composed of bosons at zero temperature and a classical system at finite temperature .",
    "this isomorphism is a consequence of the fact that the wave function describing the ground state of a system of identical bosons is nodeless .",
    "@xcite accordingly , the associated probability density function can be formally written in terms of a classical boltzmann factor @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the classical potential energy function , @xmath7 is the absolute temperature , @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath9 is to be taken equal to @xmath10 . by exploiting this isomorphism",
    "it is possible to apply the finite - temperature methods of classical statistical mechanics to estimate the properties of a quantum - mechanical boson system at zero temperature .",
    "specifically , the calculation of the zero - point equilibrium vacancy concentration in solid @xmath0he at zero temperature becomes equivalent to the determination of the thermal equilibrium vacancy concentration of the associated classical solid at a finite temperature .",
    "the latter can be computed by determining the finite - temperature vacancy - formation free energy .",
    "hodgdon and stillinger  @xcite utilized the standard classical harmonic approximation ( ha )  @xcite to determine the vacancy formation free energy and corresponding vacancy concentration . in classical solids , however , the ha is known to be problematic in the presence of defects ,  @xcite which , due to the local breaking of lattice symmetries , enhance the role of anharmonic effects . in this context ,",
    "given the significant zero - point motion in quantum solids , such anharmonic effects are also expected to be relevant in the determination of the zero - temperature equilibrium concentration of lattice vacancies in solid @xmath0he . in this light , the purpose of the present paper is to evaluate the influence of anharmonic effects on the zero - point vacancy concentration in solid @xmath0he .",
    "to this end , following the approach of hodgdon and stillinger ,  @xcite we apply the aforementioned isomorphism using an approximate description of solid @xmath0he based on a trial function of the jastrow - form .",
    "@xcite however , in addition to applying the ha to compute finite - temperature vacancy - formation free energy in the associated classical solid , we also utilize an exact method in which all anharmonic effects are explicitly included .",
