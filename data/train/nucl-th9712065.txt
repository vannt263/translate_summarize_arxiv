    "the continuous development of experimental techniques and in particular those of radioactive ion beam facilities allow now studies at the drip lines .",
    "since coulomb interaction strongly limits spatial extension of proton rich nuclei , the limit of stability on this side of the nuclear chart is closer to accessibility .",
    "moreover , going on the proton rich side , @xmath4 energy window increases , giving access to large gamow - teller strength .",
    "this latter is a very sensitive test of the microscopic structure of many - body wave functions , but also of the different correlations which can reduce the observable strength .    in the @xmath5 shell , muto et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the @xmath0 decay of several proton rich nuclei . with the wildenthal interaction @xcite ,",
    "they nicely reproduced half lives for nuclei in the range of @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "a global quenching factor of 0.60 was used for gt transitions .",
    "nevertheless , deviation of this overall value was observed by direct comparison of strength distribution up to the giant resonance region .",
    "this behaviour , also observed in the @xmath1 shell was recently analysed @xcite as the influence at high energy of intruder strength mixing .",
    "ormand @xcite has also recently investigated properties of proton drip - line nuclei , at @xmath8 interface . calculated @xmath9 decay half lives",
    "were in overall good agreement with available experimental ones .",
    "predicted branching ratios for @xmath9 decay were given .",
    "particular attention was made to determine the best candidates for the observation of correlated two - proton emission .",
    "these turned to be @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "quite recently , these calculations have been extended by cole @xcite to both heavier and lighter nuclei . as a result , @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 have also be proposed as nuclei unstable to diproton decay .",
    "theoretical studies give a microscopic description and a successful account of many observables for stable or unstable @xmath1 shell nuclei .",
    "in particular , detailed shell model calculation of the gt strength for @xmath15 @xcite have been made and a good agreement has been found with the available ( p , n ) data . in the line of these studies , we investigate now the gt strength through the weak probe , looking into the beta decay properties of @xmath16 nuclei from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "as @xmath19 is predicted to be unstable , it was not included in our study .",
    "recent significant advances have been made in the spectroscopy of these very proton - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "but if half - lives could be measured in all cases , except @xmath18 , the branching strength are still poorly known . with the available data ,",
    "the analysis of the proton spectra reveals the decay of the ias , following the fermi beta transition , with in addition one or two peaks which describe only partly the decay of the states populated through gamow - teller transitions .",
    "information on gamma transitions subsequent to , or in competition with the proton emission of the beta populated states , is not yet available .",
    "we consider the @xmath1 shell for protons and neutrons .",
    "all the calculations are done in the full space up to the case of the decay @xmath20 . for @xmath21 , we calculate the ground state and the gamow teller sum rule in the full space , but we need to introduce a truncation scheme for the study of the detailled strength function . with the usual notations where @xmath22 stands for @xmath23 , r for any of the other subshells ( @xmath24,@xmath25,@xmath26 and t for the number of particle excitations in the upper shells , we restrict ourselves to configurations `` at the level t '' which includes configurations : @xmath27 at the level of truncation `` t '' , we keep in the space only configurations with a maximum of t particles promoted from @xmath23 to @xmath24,@xmath25,@xmath28 shells .",
    "we can remark that the @xmath29 operator which connects spin - orbit partners ( @xmath23 and @xmath28 ) introduces configurations at the level t+1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 operator for z@xmath3128 also introduces configurations at the level t+1 .",
    "we use the kb3 interaction @xcite , a minimally modified version of kuo - brown interaction .",
    "this latter interaction was cured to fix correct single particle energies around @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "as already mentionned , it gives an excellent agreement with spectroscopic data in the region of stable nuclei .",
    "shell model matrices are built and diagonalized with the code antoine ( m - scheme ) @xcite and a new shell model code operating in coupled scheme representation @xcite .",
    "gamow - teller operators are renormalized by the standard value in the @xmath1 shell : @xmath34 corresponding to the systematics of @xcite and taking into account the recent measurement of ratio of axial over vector coupling constants @xcite ,    @xmath35    the half - lives are given by : @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the ground state @xmath37 values are obtained with the atomic masses taken from the compilation by audi and wapstra @xcite .",
    "for these nuclei , far from stability , reported values ( and errors ) result from systematic trends . for the evaluation of the fermi transitions ,",
    "the energy difference between pairs of isobaric analog levels is obtained with the coulomb displacement energies recently tabulated by antony et al .",
    "@xcite . in this work , for levels with isobaric spin @xmath38 , fits to the most recent data yield to the equation : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the average charge of the pair and a the mass number .",
    "gamow - teller sum rule @xmath41 , calculated in the full space are given in table[1 ] .",
    "it can be compared to @xmath42 in the mirror nucleus given by charge exchange reactions @xmath43 @xcite which make possible to observe , in principle , the total gamow - teller strength distribution .",
    "the increase of @xmath41 with the mass number , reported in table 1 , corresponds to the expected variation in this part of the @xmath1 shell as the number of valence protons increases with a and the number of neutrons holes is high . if we plot the calculated @xmath41 values versus the product of protons , @xmath44 and the number of neutron holes in the full @xmath1 shell , @xmath45 ( see figure 2 ) , the value increases , roughly linearly , as shown already by koonin and langanke @xcite who discussed the experimental results on @xmath41 in mid-@xmath1 shell nuclei .",
    "strength functions are obtained with the whitehead method @xcite by a lanczos procedure on an initial state taken as the sum rule state @xmath46 .",
    "this produces the splitting of the sum rule state over physical states in the daugther nucleus . to approximate gamow - teller strength distribution with enougth accuracy ,",
    "we need to perform a large number of lanczos iterations . for each decay of the calculation ,",
    "we have performed 300 iterations , which allow a correct convergence of all low - lying eigenstates taking part into the decay . due to this procedure and to large dimensionalities in @xmath21 , strength functions were performed in a restricted configurations space corresponding to @xmath47 .    in figure 3 , the @xmath48 distribution is shown .",
    "it reveals a very high density of transitions , especially in the case of the decay of the odd - odd nuclei @xmath49 , were the initial non zero angular momentum is connected to three different final values .",
    "a resonant - like structure is appearing with a maximum below the @xmath37 limit .",
    "it should be noticed that most of these daugther states are proton unbound and that the observation should be reached by beta - delayed proton delayed spectroscopy .",
    "gamma detection should also be associated to take into account the radiative width of the levels populated in these decays .",
    "half - lives were obtained from the partial lives of each gt decay and from fermi decay partial life .",
    "figure 4 details the beta branching ratio of each decay i.e. the relative contribution of each decay to the total half - life .",
    "attention was paid to reach convergence for each contribution in the cases of even - even parent decay .",
    "an arbitrarily cut off on the vertical scale was set at @xmath50 and could represent the experimental sensitivity .",
    "if we consider the general features of the decays we have studied , we note first the significant contribution of the fermi transition in the decay rate , in particular for the even - even nuclei .",
    "we also note ( see fig .",
    "4 ) the strong decrease of the beta - branch intensity with the excitation energy in the daughter nucleus . this fall introduces an experimental limit , far below the @xmath37 value .",
    "the theoretical calculation and experimental values are compared in table [ 2 ] . except for @xmath18 , half - lives",
    "have been measured and are found in good agreement with shell model estimates , in particular for even - even nuclei .    for comparison ,",
    "we have also reported two different predictions : the results of the gross theory of beta decay of tachibana et al .",
    "@xcite for a given set of their parametrization and also the recent evaluation of the half - live with respect to gamow - teller @xmath9 decay calculated by p. mller et al .",
    "@xcite from a quasi - particule random phase approximation .",
    "the qrpa estimates give a good agreement for @xmath20 and @xmath51 but large deviations are found in the other decays .",
    "tashibana model is of macroscopic nature involving a set of dedicated parameters and gives in this mass region a satisfactory description of the decay lifetimes .    in most cases of proton rich nuclei ,",
    "the large q value allows the daugther nucleus to decay mainly via proton emission .",
    "nevertheless , in the particular case of the ias of even - even parent , we have computed m1 transitions and gamma widths .",
    "these results are shown is table iii .",
    "the strongest transition between @xmath52 and @xmath53 is only reported here and the gamma energy is taken from the mirror nucleus .",
    "it is found that the calculated strength are close to the upper limit which has been observed for @xmath54 isovector transitions @xcite . in previous experimental work",
    "@xcite , a deficit in the intensity of the emitted protons from the ias was reported for the case of @xmath55 .",
    "gamma dexcitation are competing with particle emission and an accurate determination of isospin violation in the proton decay with inc interaction as performed previously by by ormand @xcite would allow to determine the relative intensity of the two processes .",
    "the strength function , branching ratios and half - life of the @xmath56 nuclei ( @xmath57 ) have been computed in a full major oscillator shell .",
    "the calculation gives a prediction of the distribution of the gamow - teller strength with a maximum below , or very close to the @xmath37 window limit .",
    "the experimental data available do not allow to test the calculated distributions but , only to compare half - lifes .",
    "the comparison with other calculations like models based on the finite - range droplet model made for a very large range of nuclei , is of interest to test the reliability of the calculations for nuclei far from stability , and their sensitivity to the details of nuclear structure .",
    "+ it is important to note that the same shell model calculations give an account of the gamow - teller strength observed in the @xmath43 reactions on @xmath58 targets and the one resulting from the beta decay of @xmath56 nuclei .",
    "the good agreement between the calculated values and experimental ones , observed in the @xmath43 data of @xmath59 , can not be tested up to now for the beta decay . + we conclude with a few remarks concerning the problems related to the experimental study of these very proton - rich nuclei .",
    "first , the calculations indicate a strong splitting of the strength which makes more difficult the observation of the corresponding branches and impose severe limits for the background .",
    "the second remark concerns the range of the detectable beta branches which is more limited than the @xmath37 window and makes essentially unobservable transitions in the last fraction of this window .",
    "only a dramatic improvement in the production rates of these very proton - rich nuclei would modify this limitation and make possible the observation of the shape of the main components of the gamow - teller distribution by beta - decay study .",
    "finally , the calculation reveals the strength of the @xmath54 transitions crresponding to the radiative decay of the ias populated by beta decay and the neccessity of gamma detection for a complete experimental survey .",
