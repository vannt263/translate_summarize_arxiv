    "the topic of event - by - event fluctuations of the inclusive charged particle multiplicity in relativistic heavy ion collisions has recently received attention due to the observation of non - monotonic behavior in the scaled variance ( @xmath1 ) as a function of system size at sps energies @xcite .",
    "phenix has surveyed the behavior of inclusive charged particle multiplicity fluctuations as a function of centrality and transverse momentum in @xmath2=62.4 gev and 200 gev au+au collisions , and in @xmath2=22.5 , 62.4 , and 200 gev cu+cu collisions .    since multiplicity fluctuations",
    "are well described by negative binomial distributions ( nbd ) in both elementary @xcite and heavy ion collisions @xcite , the data for a given centrality and @xmath3 bin are fit to an nbd from which the mean and variance are determined .",
    "measurements of @xmath1 as a function of azimuthal acceptance confirm that @xmath1 increases linearly with the azimuthal range over which the measurement is made for all species and centralities .",
    "hence , the results presented here are linearly extrapolated to @xmath4 azimuthal acceptance in order to facilitate direct comparisons to other measurements . due to the finite width of each centrality bin",
    ", there is a non - dynamic component of the observed fluctuations that is present due to fluctuations in the impact parameter within a centrality bin .",
    "the magnitude of this component is estimated using the hijing event generator @xcite , which well reproduces the mean multiplicity of rhic collisions @xcite .",
    "the estimate is performed by comparing fluctuations from simulated events with a fixed impact parameter to events with a range of impact parameters covering the width of each centrality bin , as determined from glauber model simulations .",
    "the hijing estimates are confirmed by comparing the hijing fixed / ranged fluctuation ratios to measured 1%/5% bin width ratios .",
    "the magnitude of the scaled variance is reduced by this correction . a 15% systematic error for this estimated",
    "is included in the error bars shown .",
    "the values of the scaled variance remain significantly above the random ( poisson ) expectation of 1.0 .    in the grand canonical ensemble",
    ", the variance and the mean of the particle number can be directly related to the compressibility , @xmath5 : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is boltzmann s constant , t is the system temperature , and v is its volume @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fluc ] ( left ) shows the fluctuations in terms of @xmath8 as a function of the number of participants , @xmath9 , for all 5 collision systems . in order to emphasize the observed universal power law scaling property",
    ", each species has been scaled to match the 200 gev au+au data .",
    "the data points for all systems can be best described by the curve @xmath10 . the observed scaling is independent of the @xmath11 range over which the measurement is made .",

    "phenix has also completed a survey that expands upon previous measurements of event - by - event transverse momentum fluctuations in 200 gev au+au collisions @xcite . here , the magnitude of the @xmath3 fluctuations will be quoted using the variable @xmath13 , as described in @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 is the mean of the covariance of all particle pairs in an event , normalized by the inclusive mean @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath13 is related to the inverse of the heat capacity of the system @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fluc ] ( right ) shows @xmath13 as a function of @xmath9 for all 5 collision systems measured over the @xmath11 range @xmath12 gev / c .",
    "the data is shown within the effective phenix azimuthal acceptance of 4.24 radians .",
    "note that the magnitude of @xmath13 exhibits little variation for the different collision energies . since @xmath13 does not scale with the jet cross section at different energies , it is evident that hard processes are not the primary contributor to the observed fluctuations . with the exception of the very most peripheral collisions ,",
    "all systems exhibit a universal power law scaling as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "the data points for all systems are best described by the curve : @xmath14 . the observed scaling is independent of the @xmath11 range over which the measurement is made .",
    "the study of fluctuations is important since they provide information on whether or not a system undergoes a phase transition .",
    "correlations can also be used for this purpose . near a critical point ,",
    "several properties of a system diverge .",
    "the rate of divergence can be described by a set of critical exponents , which should be identical for any system belonging in the same universality class .",
    "the critical exponent for the correlation function is @xmath0 , which can be directly extracted from the hbt component of azimuthal correlation functions : @xmath15 , where d is the dimensionality of the system @xcite .",
    "phenix has measured azimuthal correlation functions of like - sign pairs at low @xmath11 for several collision systems .",
    "the correlations shown will isolate the hbt peak in pseudorapidity by restricting @xmath16 for each particle pair .",
    "correlations are constructed for low @xmath11 pairs by correlating all particle pairs in an event where both particles lie within the @xmath11 range @xmath17 gev / c and @xmath18 gev / c .",
    "note that there is no trigger particle in this analysis .",
    "the correlation functions are constructed using mixed events as follows : @xmath19 .",
    "figure [ fig : corr ] shows azimuthal correlation functions for cu+cu and au+au collisions .",
    "the dashed lines are the critical exponent function fits .",
    "confirmation of the hbt peak has been made by observing its disappearance in unlike - sign pair correlations and by observing @xmath20 peaks when selecting this region .",
    "for all collision systems , including 200 gev d+au , the extracted value of the critical exponent @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ( bottom right ) lies between -0.6 and -0.7 with d=3 , independent of centrality . since @xmath0 is constant in heavy ion collisions , does not differ from the d+au system , and has a value that significantly differs from expectations from a qcd phase transition ( e.g. if qcd belongs in the same universality class as the 3-d ising model ( d=3 ) , @xmath0=+0.5 @xcite ) , it is unlikely that critical behavior is being observed in the correlation functions measured thus far .",
    "measurements of several properties of the low @xmath11 correlation functions are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "note that a familiar feature is apparent in the low @xmath11 correlation functions for central au+au collisions at @xmath2=200 and 62 gev .",
