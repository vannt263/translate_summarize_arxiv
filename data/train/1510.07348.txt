    "when a narrow linewidth optical pump wave reaches a certain power threshold in a dielectric material , it can generate a counter - propagating optical stokes wave together with a strong co - propagating acoustic wave through the process of backward stimulated brillouin scattering ( bsbs ) .",
    "the generated stokes wave is doppler red - shifted with respect to the pump wave by the acoustic resonance frequency @xmath0 .",

    "note that the main reason for the difference of the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : theory_stability ]  ( e ) and ( f ) are the different ratios between phonon and photon lifetime for the long and the short resonators . in this case",
    ", no interactions were included that are not phase - matched and the waves experience a comparable gain per transit .",
    "however , in the short resonator , the photon lifetime is shorter , which broadens the linewidth of the cavity resonances and leads to a different ratio between cavity linewidth and brillouin gain linewidth .",
    "in this paper , we derived the dynamic coupled - mode equations for cascaded bsbs in fibers including all kfwm and befwm interactions . coupled - mode equations were obtained by expressing the acoustic field with a single acoustic wave and as a superposition of several acoustic waves with different propagation constants .",
    "we used the derived equations to numerically simulate cascaded bsbs in a low - finesse , chalcogenide , fp fiber resonators of two different lengths and qualitatively investigated the relative importance of the different fwm terms with regards to phase - locking of the optical waves . in the longer resonator ,",
    "corresponding to a previous experiment based on a 38 cm long chalcogenide fiber resonator @xcite , kfwm of co - propagating waves is most relevant for phase - locking .",
    "in contrast , in the shorter resonator of 4  cm length , kfwm and the phase - sensitive coupling of several optical waves via befwm contributed to phase - locking .    in the model described in this paper , dispersion has been neglected since we assumed that the interaction takes place over a narrow optical bandwidth as in the experiments described in refs .",
    "@xcite . for numerical modeling of broad bfcs that are generated by the interplay of bsbs and the kerr - nonlinearity , as demonstrated in reference @xcite",
    ", dispersion would have to be considered .",
    "equations  [ eq : bfc_fiber_aj_with_qls ] and  [ eq : bfc_fiber_ql ] were derived by expressing the electrical and the acoustic field as a superposition of several co - propagating waves with different propagation constants .",
    "this approach is advantageous for numerical modeling of waveguides that are long enough that kfwm of counter - propagating waves and befwm can be neglected , e.g.  long silica fiber resonators .",
    "this can be understood considering that simulating the interaction of counter - propagating optical waves requires performing an integration at each spatial grid point of the resonator for each time step . describing the acoustic field as a single wave requires the spatial grid to be fine enough to resolve the modulations of the acoustic wave on a length scale below @xmath199 , in order to include bsbs of higher order stokes components ( see equation  [ eq : theory_cme_acoustic_1acoustic ] ) . on the other hand , when the acoustic wave is split in components with different propagation constants , as in equation  [ eq : bfc_fiber_ql ] , the amplitudes of the acoustic waves @xmath105 vary on the same length scale as the amplitudes of the optical waves , which can be tens of meters , e.g.  in the case of a long silica fiber .",
    "this allows a significantly coarser spatial grid for the numerical simulation , which can decrease the required computation time by several orders of magnitude .    in principle , cascaded bsbs can also be described by representing both the electrical and acoustic fields with one forward and one backward propagating wave .",
    "the generation of new frequencies then manifests as modulations of the amplitudes of the waves .",
    "this could be advantageous for modeling short resonators as it significantly reduces the number of coupling terms since this number is then independent of the number of generated stokes waves .",
    "a spatial discretisation that is fine enough to resolve the amplitude modulations , representing higher order stokes waves , would be necessary .",
    "for bsbs on very short length scales , the propagation of the acoustic wave may also have to be considered if the amplitudes of the acoustic waves vary on lengths scales that are on the order of the decay length of the acoustic wave ( @xmath201 m ) .",
