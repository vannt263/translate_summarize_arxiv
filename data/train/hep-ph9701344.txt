    "in the standard model , given values of the three gauge couplings , the yukawa couplings , the higgs boson self - coupling , and a dimensionful observable ( e.g. the muon lifetime , a gauge boson mass or a quark mass ) , any other observable can then be computed . in a grand - unified theory ( gut ) , one need only input two of the gauge couplings , then the third one can be predicted , as well as other observables .",
    "thus gut theories are more predictive .",
    "because the su(2 ) and u(1 ) couplings are measured quite precisely , we will examine the prediction of the strong coupling constant in grand - unified theories , both in the standard model and in supersymmetric models .",
    "we start with the one - loop results and then proceed to discuss the next higher - order corrections .",
    "the inclusion of these corrections leads to a precise prediction of the strong coupling constant .",
    "we are interested in measuring gauge couplings at the weak - scale or below , and running the gauge couplings up to higher scales .",
    "the solution of the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) accurately describes the evolution of the couplings , even as they are evolved over many decades . at one - loop ,",
    "the renormalization group equations for the gauge couplings are @xmath3 where the @xmath4 are the one - loop beta - constants .",
    "these constants receive contributions from every particle which circulates in the one - loop gauge - boson self - energy diagram . for example , for a fermion doublet @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the one - loop renormalization group equation is easily solved .",
    "the inverse of the gauge coupling evolves linearly with the log of the scale , @xmath7 if we assume that the couplings do unify at some scale , we have that @xmath8 this equation is valid for any scale @xmath9 between the weak scale and the unification scale .",
    "next , we deduce the values of the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauge couplings from the quantities @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the values of the electromagnetic coupling and sine - squared weak mixing angle evaluated at @xmath14 ) @xmath15 given the standard model values of the one - loop beta - constants @xmath16 we determine the prediction of the strong coupling constant in the standard model @xmath17 with negligible error . comparing with the measured value as quoted by the particle data group @xcite , @xmath18",
    ", we see that the standard model prediction of the strong coupling constant is about 16 standard deviations too small .",
    "including higher order corrections can not help repair this situation by more than a few standard deviations . in order to remedy this huge discrepancy",
    ", we need to go beyond the standard model , adding matter to change the beta - constants @xmath4 .",
    "we also need to specify the mass scale of the new matter .",
    "rather than determining what additional matter content will lead to successful gauge coupling unification in an ad hoc fashion , we will examine the implications of a motivated model .",
    "it is widely accepted that the standard model is an effective theory .",
    "some new physics must become manifest at scales below the multi - tev scale .",
    "a promising model of new physics is supersymmetry @xcite , which , among other virtues , explains how a theory with a weak - scale elementary higgs boson is stable with respect to the planck scale .",
    "supersymmetry also naturally explains the breaking of electroweak symmetry @xcite , and it typically contains a natural dark matter candidate @xcite .    in order to make the standard model supersymmetric , we are required to add a specific set of new particles , the superpartners . for every standard - model gauge boson we must add a spin-1/2 majorana particle , a gaugino . and for every standard - model fermion we must add a spin-0 partner , a squark or a slepton . in order to give both up- and down - type fermions a mass , and to ensure anomaly cancellation , we must also add an additional higgs doublet .",
    "we refer to the two higgs doublets as `` up - type '' and `` down - type '' .",
    "this additional particle content defines the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in the simplest and most often considered versions of the mssm with high - energy inputs ,",
    "the entire supersymmetric spectrum scales with one or two parameters which must be near the weak scale by naturalness considerations .",
    "given this new matter content and the superpartner mass scale , which we take to be @xmath14 for the moment , we can take a first order look at the prediction of the strong coupling constant in the mssm . as before we use eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) to solve for @xmath19 as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath21 . now",
    "the beta - constants are different .",
    "because of the new matter content , we have the following changes from the standard - model values @xmath22 we use the central values and errors in eq .",
    "( [ g1g2 ] ) to find @xmath23 the new matter content mandated by supersymmetry brings the prediction for the strong coupling constant to the measured value ( @xmath24 ) within one standard deviation !",
    "this could be a coincidence , or it could be a hint that we are on the right track by considering minimal low energy supersymmetry .",
    "next we will consider corrections to the prediction of @xmath25 in the mssm .",
    "in this section we consider two sources of corrections to the prediction of the strong coupling constant in the mssm .",
    "the first involves improving the evolution of the couplings from their initial values at the grand unification scale to the weak scale ( or , the supersymmetry breaking scale ) .",
    "we simply extend the renormalization group equations to one higher loop order .",
    "this means that in addition to resumming logarithms of the form @xmath26^n$ ] from the one - loop rge , we now resum logarithms of the form @xmath27^n$ ] from the two - loop terms . at two - loops",
    "it is necessary to run both the gauge and yukawa couplings together , as they form a coupled set of differential equations .",
    "the general form for either a gauge or yukawa coupling rge at two - loops is @xcite @xmath28 since we can safely ignore the small yukawa couplings of the first two generations , the set @xmath29 includes @xmath30 .",
    "the equations are readily solved numerically .",
    "the correction due to the two - loop rge s is large and positive .",
    "the prediction of @xmath19 increases by about @xmath31 .",
    "the second source of corrections we will consider in this section are the supersymmetric threshold corrections . these are divided into two types , the logarithmic corrections and the finite ( i.e. non - logarithmic ) corrections .",
    "we will discuss these in turn .",
    "when we arrived at the prediction ( [ pred ] ) we assumed that the masses of the superpartners were equal to @xmath14 . however , we know from collider searches that many of the superpartner masses must be heavier than @xmath14 , and in general they could be an order of magnitude heavier without straining naturalness considerations too much .",
    "as we evolve the gauge couplings down from high scales , we must decouple each superpartner contribution in turn as we cross the mass threshold .",
    "hence we arrive at logarithmic corrections of the form @xmath32 . from these corrections",
    "we determine the shift in the prediction of the strong coupling and find , in general , for a particle of mass @xmath33 with @xmath34 contributions to the beta - constants @xmath35\\ln{m\\over m_z}.\\label{mas}\\ ] ] note that the beta - constants @xmath4 in this equation _ include _ the entire superpartner spectrum . plugging in all the superpartners , we arrive at the following supersymmetric threshold correction @xmath36\\ .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the first term @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ) denote the left - handed ( right - handed ) squark and slepton masses .",
    "this term is easily modified to account for generation - dependent masses .",
    "there are a few aspects of this equation worth pointing out .",
    "first , notice that the first term does not contain @xmath14 .",
    "this is because the squarks and sleptons are in complete su(5 ) multiplets , and degenerate complete multiplets do not affect @xmath25 at one loop .",
    "it happens that this particular combination of soft squark and slepton masses is near unity in the entire parameter space of both of the models that we consider in the following section .",
    "hence , the squarks and sleptons do not significantly affect the prediction of @xmath19 .",
    "another point is that the su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauginos contribute corrections which largely combine into the term @xmath42 . in gut models",
    "the gaugino masses are degenerate above the unification scale . at one - loop",
    "they are renormalized proportional to the corresponding gauge couplings , so the ratio @xmath43 . at the weak scale",
    ", this ratio is about @xmath44 .",
    "hence , this term contributes about @xmath45 to @xmath19 , independent of parameter space .",
    "the remaining terms include the residual term from the su(2 ) gaugino mass , and the contributions of the heavy higgs bosons and higgsinos .",
    "if we take these three masses to be characterized by a single scale @xmath46 , then these terms combine to give @xmath47 hence , as we increase the supersymmetric mass scale the prediction of the strong coupling constant decreases .",
    "this makes sense , since , in the limit that the entire supersymmetric spectrum is raised above @xmath48 we should recover the prediction of the standard model .",
    "( in fact @xmath49 . )",
    "if @xmath50 tev this correction yields @xmath51 .",
    "note that the largest contribution to eq .",
    "( [ msusy ] ) is due to the @xmath52 term . because we impose electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ", @xmath53 is a measure of the fine tuning necessary to obtain the @xmath54-mass from the input mass parameters .",
    "the predicted strong coupling is larger in the region of no fine tuning ( @xmath55 ) than in the region of appreciable fine tuning ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "there is one last point about eq .",
    "( [ dals ] ) .",
    "because of the particle content of the supersymmetric standard model , the particles which are charged under su(2 ) always come into the expression for @xmath57 with a positive coefficient in front of the logarithm of the mass .",
    "the su(2 ) singlets always come with a negative coefficient .",
    "hence , heavy su(2 ) doublets , for example @xmath58 , @xmath59 or @xmath60 , will decrease @xmath25 , and heavy su(2 ) singlets , e.g. the gluino , will increase the prediction of the strong coupling .    besides the logarithmic corrections of eq .",
    "( [ dals ] ) , there are also finite corrections .",
    "these arise when the full one - loop correction to @xmath13 is taken into account . taking the electromagnetic constant , the @xmath54-boson mass , and the muon lifetime as inputs , we determine the @xcite renormalized weak mixing angle @xcite , @xmath61 the correction @xmath62 is comprised of the real and transverse gauge - boson self - energy contribution ( the oblique correction ) , and the vertex and box diagram contributions , @xmath63 ( the non - universal part ) @xcite .",
    "the oblique correction contains both logarithmic and finite contributions , while @xmath63 is purely finite .",
    "the finite contributions decouple as @xmath64 for large supersymmetric masses .    in the regions of",
    "parameter space where some su(2 ) non - singlet particles are of order @xmath14 , the finite corrections to the weak mixing angle can substantially increase the prediction of the strong coupling constant @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .  1 .",
    "we show the prediction of the strong coupling with and without taking the finite corrections into account in the supergravity model described below . if all the supersymmetric particles are above a few hundred gev , the finite corrections are negligible . in that case",
    "the low - energy threshold corrections are well approximated by the logarithms in eq .",
    "( [ dals ] ) .",
    "utilizing the two - loop renormalization group equations and the weak - scale threshold corrections we are now in a position to present the improved prediction of the strong coupling constant in the supersymmetric case . we still need to specify the supersymmetric particle spectrum . in what follows",
    "we consider two models in turn , first a minimal supergravity model , then a simple model with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking",
    ".      in the minimal supergravity model there are universal soft - supersymmetry breaking parameters induced at the grand unification scale .",
    "these include a gaugino mass @xmath65 , a scalar mass @xmath66 , and a trilinear scalar coupling @xmath67 .",
    "also , we require that electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively @xcite .",
    "this happens naturally , as the large top - quark yukawa coupling drives the up - type higgs mass - squared negative near the weak scale .",
    "given the @xmath54-boson mass and @xmath68 ( the ratio of up - type higgs boson vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to down - type ) , we impose electroweak symmetry breaking and this allows us to solve for the masses of the heavy higgs bosons and their superpartners , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the prediction of the strong coupling in the @xmath66 , @xmath65 plane . after including the corrections",
    "the supersymmetric prediction is not as consistent with the measured value @xmath24 .",
    "we find that for squark masses below about 1 tev ( where the model is more natural ) @xmath25 is predicted to be greater than 0.127 .",
    "for the smallest supersymmetric masses we find numbers larger than 0.140 .",
    "the predicted value is three to seven standard deviations larger than the measured value .",
    "= 2.5 in    the prediction of @xmath25 depends slightly on @xmath71 .",
    "it changes by about 0.001 if @xmath71 changes by 10 gev .",
    "of the three input parameters @xmath72 and @xmath12 , only @xmath12 has an appreciable error .",
    "changing @xmath12 by 1-@xmath73 changes @xmath25 by about 0.001 .",
    "the prediction weakly depends on @xmath68 because at small ( @xmath74 ) or large ( @xmath75 ) @xmath68 the top , bottom , and/or tau - yukawa couplings become large , and they enter into the two - loop renormalization group equations of the gauge couplings . the prediction for @xmath19",
    "can be lowered by about 0.002 at the extreme values of @xmath68 is due solely to the yukawa couplings entering into the two - loop rge s",
    ". there may be an additional dependence because the particle spectrum depends on @xmath68 . ] .",
    "the strong coupling is also insensitive to the sign of the higgsino mass term @xmath76 . in fig .  2 and the following figures we set @xmath77 .",
    "hence we find that we can not avoid the large values of @xmath25 shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we will give an interpretation of these large numbers after discussing the gauge - mediated case .",
    "models with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking are an attractive alternative to the supergravity models . in the supergravity model we considered",
    ", we chose universal boundary conditions , which suppress dangerous squark- and slepton - mediated flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "however , there is no symmetry which protects this choice of boundary conditions , and hence it is an artificial imposition .",
    "the advantage of the gauge - mediated models is that flavor changing neutral currents are automatically suppressed , since the soft supersymmetry breaking masses which are induced by the gauge interactions are flavor diagonal and generation independent .    in the simplest models with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite",
    ", there is a messenger sector with the superpotential interaction @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a standard - model singlet superfield , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are a pair of messenger fields which are vector - like under the standard - model gauge group , and @xmath82 is the messenger yukawa coupling . in a grand unified theory , @xmath80 and @xmath83",
    "come in full su(5 ) representations .",
    "we will consider @xmath84 5+@xmath85 pairs and @xmath86 10+@xmath87 representations .",
    "perturbative unification of the gauge couplings is ensured if we allow at most ( @xmath88 ) = ( 1,1 ) or ( 4,0 ) .    in these models",
    "the singlet superfield s couples to a sector in which supersymmetry is dynamically broken , and as a result the it acquires both a vev ( @xmath79 ) and an f - term ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "this in turn generates supersymmetry - conserving diagonal entries and supersymmetry - violating off diagonal entries in the @xmath90 scalar mass matrix .",
    "the @xmath80 and @xmath83 fields enter into loop diagrams with standard model fields on the external legs , thereby generating soft supersymmetry breaking masses for the superpartners and the higgs bosons .",
    "the gaugino and scalar masses are generated at one- and two - loops , respectively , and in the limit @xmath91 are given by @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the messenger mass scale , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 for fundamental representations and 0 for singlet representations .",
    "the mass parameters ( [ bc1],[bc2 ] ) serve as boundary conditions for the renormalization group equations at the messenger scale . in order to determine the superparticle spectrum we run these parameters from the messenger scale to the weak scale using the two - loop renormalization group equations . as before we impose radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and determine the higgs boson and higgsino masses @xmath69 and @xmath70 for a given @xmath68 .",
    "hence , the parameter space of the model under consideration is @xmath96 where @xmath82 is the value of the messenger yukawa coupling at the grand unification scale ( we assume a single yukawa coupling ) .",
    "note that a physical messenger spectrum requires @xmath97 .",
    "after we determine the superpartner spectrum at the weak scale , we apply the same weak - scale gauge coupling threshold corrections as in the supergravity model . however , the messenger sector gives rise to additional corrections .",
    "not only are the one- and two - loop renormalization group equations altered above the messenger scale @xcite , but there are also new threshold corrections at the scale @xmath80 .",
    "a degenerate su(5 ) multiplet does not affect the prediction of @xmath25 at one loop .",
    "however , the evolution of the messenger yukawa couplings from the grand unification scale down to the messenger scale splits the messenger multiplets .",
    "if we decompose a 5+@xmath98 pair of messenger fields into their doublet and triplet components , respectively denoted @xmath99 and @xmath100 , then the messenger sector superpotential below the grand unification scale becomes @xmath101 thus the messenger doublet ( triplet ) ends up with mass @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ mas ] ) , this mass splitting leads to the threshold correction ( the @xmath104 fields decompose into ( su(2),su(3 ) ) representations @xmath9 ( 2,3 ) , @xmath105 ( 1,3 ) , and @xmath106 ( 1,1 ) ) ) is replaced according to @xmath107/[1-(f/\\lambda_2s^2)^2]$ ] . ]",
    "@xmath108 the yukawa couplings are evaluated at the messenger scale , either @xmath109 or @xmath110 .",
    "note that at one loop order @xmath111 .    to determine the messenger yukawa couplings at the messenger scale we solve the renormalization group equations which are of the form @xcite @xmath112 where the dots indicate that there may be extra contributions due to interactions of the singlet with the supersymmetry breaking sector fields .",
    "these extra contributions are the same for all the messenger fields so they do not affect the ratios of yukawa couplings . note that for a large initial value of the messenger yukawa coupling the renormalization group evolution is initially dominated by the yukawa term which leads to the same evolution for the various messenger fields .",
    "hence , there will be less splitting if the initial value is large .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .  3 where we show the ratio of messenger yukawa couplings at the messenger scale vs. the starting value at the grand unification scale . in the 10+@xmath87 case",
    "we see that @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) varies from 1.2 to 1.3 ( 2.3 to 2.6 ) .",
    "hence the splitting is small and confined to a narrow range of values . plugging this splitting into eq .",
    "( [ dam ] ) we find that the messenger threshold correction results in at most @xmath115 for @xmath116 , @xmath117 for @xmath118 , and @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "= 2.5 in    combining all the effects together we show the full result for the prediction of @xmath19 in the gauge - mediated model in the @xmath121 , @xmath122 plane in fig .  4 , with @xmath123 , @xmath118 and @xmath124 .",
    "we see slightly smaller numbers than in the supergravity case ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "relative to other choices of @xmath125 and @xmath82 , this case results in the smallest values of @xmath19 . as before",
    "the result is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath68 .",
    "changing the value of the messenger yukawa coupling does not change the value of the strong coupling significantly .    the dashed lines in fig .",
    "4 indicate that the region of parameter space with the least fine tuning ( @xmath126 ) corresponds to the largest value of @xmath127 .",
    "the strong coupling can be reduced significantly at the cost of fine tuning . in the fine tuned region",
    "@xmath128 , @xmath129 .    = 2.5 in    we summarize the predicted values of @xmath25 in the gauge - mediated models in table 1",
    ". here we set @xmath130 gev , @xmath123 , and @xmath77 .",
    "we find that if @xmath131 , @xmath19 is greater than 0.124 .",
    "this is 2 standard deviations larger than the measured value .",
    "hence , we are faced with the fact that , like the standard model , supersymmetric models do not predict that the gauge couplings meet .",
    "however the discrepancy in the standard model case is enormous .",
    "the small discrepancy in the mssm can be accounted for , and is required by , threshold corrections at the grand unification scale .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "at the gut scale there are incomplete su(5 ) multiplets ( most notably the color triplet higgs bosons ) and there can be split multiplets as well .",
    "these fields give rise to threshold corrections which are expected to be of order a couple of per cent ( or larger if @xmath132 is larger ) .",
    "if we take the all three gauge couplings as input at the weak scale and run them up to the grand unification scale @xmath48 ( which is defined to be the scale where @xmath133 and @xmath134 meet ) we find a discrepancy between the value of @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "it is constrained to be larger than about 10@xmath144 gev by the lower limits on the nucleon lifetimes @xcite .",
    "both @xmath48 and the bound on @xmath143 are functions of the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "the bound on @xmath143 is typically such that @xmath145 , so that in most of the minimal su(5 ) model parameter space @xmath137 is positive . from fig .",
    "5 we know that in order to be compatible with gauge coupling unification @xmath137 must be negative . hence",
    ", the minimal su(5 ) model is not compatible with coupling constant unification .",
    "the minimal su(5 ) model contains a 5+@xmath85 of higgs fields .",
    "the doublet parts are the mssm higgs fields with order @xmath14 masses .",
    "the triplet parts mediate nucleon decay via dimension 5 operators . in order to be compatible with the lower bound on the nucleon lifetimes the triplet higgs particles must have gut scale masses . in general",
    "it is problematic to find a gut model which naturally yields light higgs doublets and heavy triplets . in the minimal su(5 ) model this doublet - triplet splitting is imposed by fine tuning superpotential parameters .",
    "the missing doublet model elegantly solves the doublet - triplet splitting problem by a judicious choice of higgs representations .",
    "the 75 , 50 and @xmath146 representations are employed , and when the 75 gets a vev the superpotential term 75 50 5 generates a mass for the triplet , but not for the doublet .    in the missing doublet model",
    "we find @xcite @xmath147 we have defined an effective triplet higgs mass @xmath148 which enters into the nucleon decay amplitude in the same way as in the minimal su(5 ) model , so the same bounds apply .",
    "however , the splitting in the 75-dimensional representation gives rise to a negative correction , such that in the missing doublet model the discrepancy @xmath137 is negative , just as it must be in order to be consistent with the measured values of @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "in fact , in each of the three models shown in fig .  5 , the allowed range of @xmath137 in the missing doublet model just about overlaps the required values .",
    "hence , the missing doublet model is consistent with gauge coupling unification .",
    "in the end what we really do when we investigate gauge coupling unification is constrain the physics at the grand - unification scale .",
    "the weak - scale measurements of the gauge couplings imply that @xmath137 is negative .",
    "we can calculate @xmath137 in various grand unified models to see whether the grand unified model parameter space can accommodate the required value .",
    "here we showed that this is not possible in the minimal su(5 ) model , but that it is possible in the missing doublet su(5 ) model .",
    "in other words , the missing doublet model requires that @xmath137 is negative , which corresponds with the measured values of the gauge couplings .",
    "similarly , there are so(10 ) models which can accommodate the ` measured ' @xmath137 , and others which can not .",
