    "the conventional wisdom is that all pulsars have mass close to the chandrasekhar value , @xmath2 .",
    "this belief has arisen from high precision measurements of neutron star ",
    "neutron star binary systems ; in all cases , the pulsar and the secondary neutron star have masses within a narrow range , 1.33 to 1.45m@xmath1 ( stairs et al .",
    "2002 , weisberg & taylor 2003 , deich & kulkarni 1996 ) .",
    "perhaps all neutron stars are born within this narrow mass range , or perhaps the particular evolution of double neutron star leads to this result ( brown 1995 ) . even if all neutron stars are born near the chandrasekhar mass , they may achieve higher masses through accretion of matter from orbital companions .",
    "millisecond pulsars in orbits with white dwarfs , in particular , are known to have accreted mass during their low - mass x - ray binary phases , and hence they are prime candidates to be relatively massive pulsars .",
    "there has been some observational evidence for heavy pulsars in these systems ( kaspi , taylor , & ryba 1994 ; van straten et al .",
    "2001 ) , although a statistical study argued that they are no heavier than pulsars in double neutron star binaries ( thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ) .    in this status report",
    ", we summarize observations of four millisecond pulsars in pulsar  white dwarf binaries made with the arecibo telescope .",
    "this is an update of nice , splaver , & stairs ( 2003 ) , incorporating significant new timing data from psr  j0751 + 1807 and an improved timing model ( including orbital - annual parallax ) for psr j1713 + 0747 .",

    "observations were made at arecibo over several years at radio frequencies 430 and 1410mhz , primarily using the princeton markiv data acquisition system ( stairs et al .",
    "details will be given elsewhere .",
    "these data were augmented by observations at green bank ( 140 foot telescope ) , jodrell bank , and effelsberg , as well as data collected at arecibo using the arecibo berkeley pulsar processor and the princeton markiii system .",
    "pulse arrival times were derived using conventional methods and were fit to timing models using tempo . for each pulsar binary , at least one post - keplerian orbital parameter is detectable , leading to constraints on pulsar mass , @xmath6 , secondary star mass , @xmath8 , and orbital inclination , @xmath9 .",
    "( see taylor , 1992 , for the relations between post - keplerian parameters , masses , and orbital inclination . ) to derive confidence intervals on @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , we calculated the goodness - of - fit of timing solutions over a grid of trial values of @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "each pair of trial values corresponds to a particular pulsar mass , @xmath6 , according to the mass function , @xmath11 where @xmath12s is the solar mass in time units , @xmath3 is the orbital period , @xmath13 is the semi - major axis projected into the line - of - sight in time units , and @xmath6 and @xmath8 are in solar mass units . for each trial",
    ", relativistic post - keplerian parameters appropriate to @xmath10 and @xmath8 were calculated and held constant , while all other parameters were fit .",
    "the contours plotted in figure 1 show the combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath6 that gave acceptable fits for each source .",
    "we expect @xmath10 to be uniformly distributed for randomly oriented binary systems .",
    "( other than this , the intrinsic values of @xmath9 are of limited interest . ) table 1 summarizes the pulsar parameters and 95% confidence limits on pulsar masses from the timing data .",
    "this is an `` intermediate mass '' binary millisecond pulsar , presumably with a co white dwarf secondary .",
    "constraints on the masses come from the relativistic advance of periastron  we measure the precession rate to be @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , yielding @xmath16and from the lack of detection of shapiro delay , which excludes large inclinations . while the canonical pulsar mass value of 1.35m@xmath1 falls within the allowed region ( fig .",
    "1 ) , higher values are preferred , especially when we include the constraint that the white dwarf secondary have mass less than 1.4m@xmath1 ( shading in fig .",
    "1 ) . see splaver et al .",

    "this pulsar has a very short orbital period . by combining pre - upgrade ( 19931994 ) and post - upgrade ( 19992003 ) arecibo observations of this source , along with data from jodrell bank and effelsberg , we are able to detect the orbital decay due to emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "the rate of change of orbital period is @xmath17 .",
    "this is the first detection of the decay of a pulsar  white dwarf orbit with a low mass ratio ( @xmath0).6545 , a young pulsar in an eccentric orbit with a massive white dwarf ( bailes et al .",
    "2003 . ) ] shapiro delay is marginally detected , constraining @xmath9 to intermediate values . if the shapiro delay detection can be confirmed and refined it will provide independent constraints on the system masses , allowing for novel tests of relativistic gravity ( arzoumanian 2003 ) . in any case , the allowed values of @xmath6 are significantly greater than 1.35@xmath18 ( fig .  1 ) .    .",
    "these pulsars are in wide orbits with light white dwarf companions . in both cases ,",
    "the shapiro delay is detectable , constraining @xmath9 and @xmath6 as shown in figure 1 .",
    "binary evolution theory posits a narrow range of companion masses , @xmath8 , for a given orbital period , @xmath3 , in these systems ( podsiadlowski , rappaport , & pfahl 2002 ; tauris & savonije 1999 ; rappaport et al .",
    "the resulting constraints on @xmath6 and @xmath9 are indicated in figure 1 .",
    "once again , values of @xmath6 somewhat higher than 1.35m@xmath1 are preferred .",
    "( van straten et al . 2001 ) . ]",
    "the sources individually provide some evidence for pulsars substantially more massive than the chandrasekhar value , and the collection of constraints shown in figure 1 provides a compelling case for heavy neutron stars .",
