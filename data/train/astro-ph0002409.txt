    "cosmological models with a dominant cold dark matter component predict dark matter halos with strongly bound , kinematically cold cores ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 , warren _",
    "_ 1992 , navarro _",
    "1997 ) . within the core region ,",
    "the dark matter density increases as a power - law @xmath7 with @xmath8 in the range of 1 to 2 and the velocity dispersion @xmath9 decreases towards the center ( carlberg 1994 , fukushige & makino 1997 ) . numerous numerical simulations ( e.g. moore _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , huss _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , jing & suto 2000 ) , as well as analytical theory ( syer & white 1998 , kull 1999 ) , have shown that such a core structure follows naturally from collisionless hierarchical merging of cold dark matter halos , independent of the adopted cosmological parameters .",
    "it has recently become clear that on galactic scales the predictions of cold dark matter models are not in agreement with several observations .",
    "high - resolution calculations by klypin _",
    "( 1999 ) and moore _",
    "( 1999 ) have shown that the predicted number and mass distribution of galaxies in galactic clusters is consistent with the observations . however , on scales of the local group , roughly one thousand dark matter halos should exist as separate , self - gravitating objects , whereas less than one hundred galaxies are observed .",
    "this disagreement can be attributed to the high core densities of satellite dark halos in cosmological models which stabilize them against tidal disruption on galactic scales .",
    "( 1998 ) and lateron navarro and steinmetz ( 2000 ) found that cold - dark matter models reproduce well the i - band tully - fisher slope and scatter .",
    "they however fail to match the zero - point of the tully - fisher relation as well as the relation between disk rotation speed and angular momentum .",
    "again , this problem can be traced to the excessive central concentrations of cold dark halos .",
    "finally , recent observations of dark matter dominated rotation curves of dwarf galaxies have indicated shallow dark matter cores which can be described by isothermal spheres with finite central densities ( moore 1994 , flores & primack 1994 , burkert 1995 , de blok & mc gaugh 1997 , burkert & silk 1999 , dalcanton & bernstein 2000 , see however van den bosch _ et al . _ 1999 ) , in contrast to the power - law cusps , expected from cosmological models .",
    "the disagreement between observations and theory indicates that a substantial revision to the cold dark matter scenario might be required which could provide valuable insight into the origin and nature of dark matter .    motivated by these problems , spergel & steinhardt ( 1999 ) proposed a model where dark matter particles experience weak self - interaction on scales of kpc to mpc for typical galactic densities .",
    "they noted that self - interaction could lead to satellite evaporation due to the dark particles within the satellites being kicked out by high - velocity encounters with dark particles from the surrounding dark halo of the parent galaxy . in order for weak interaction to be important on galactic scales",
    ", they estimate that the ratio of the collision cross section and the particle mass should be of order @xmath10 1 @xmath2 g@xmath3 .",
    "the spergel and steinhardt model has already motivated several follow - up studies .",
    "for example , ostriker ( 1999 ) demonstrated that weak self - interaction would have the interesting side product of naturally growing black holes with masses in the range @xmath11 m@xmath12 in galactic centers .",
    "hogan & dalcanton ( 2000 ) investigated analytically the effect of particle self - interactions on the structure and stability of galaxy halos .",
    "moore et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , adopting a gas - dynamical approach , showed that in the limit of infinitely large interaction cross sections dark halos would develop singular isothermal density profiles which are not in agreement with observations .",
    "mo & mao ( 2000 ) and firmani et al . ( 2000 ) investigated the affect of self - interaction on rotation curves .",
    "in addition , models of repulsive dark matter ( goodman 2000 ) , fluid dark matter ( peebles 2000 ) and self - interacting warm dark matter ( hannestad & scherrer 2000 ) have recently been discussed .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate the effect of weak self - interaction on the internal structure of cold dark matter halos .",
    "if the interaction cross section is not exceptionally large , the dark matter system can not be treated as a collision dominated , hydrodynamical fluid .",
    "section 2 therefore introduces a new numerical monte - carlo - n - body ( mcn ) method for weakly interacting particle systems .",
    "initial conditions are discussed in section 3 . using the mcn - method ,",
    "the evolution of weakly self - interacting dark matter halos is investigated in section 4 .",
    "conclusions follow in section 5 .",
    "within the framework of weak self - interacting , the mean free path @xmath13 of a dark matter particle is determined by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the local dark matter mass density and @xmath16 is the ratio between the self - interaction collision cross section @xmath17 and the particle mass @xmath18 .",
    "if , within a timestep @xmath19 , the path length @xmath20 of a particle with velocity v is short compared to @xmath13 , the probability @xmath21 for it to interact with another particle can be approximated by    @xmath22    we use a monte - carlo approach in order to include weak self - interaction in a collisionless n - body code that utilizes the special purpose hardware grape ( gravity pipe ; sugimoto et al .",
    "1990 ) in order to determine the gravitational forces between the dark matter particles by direct summation . for each particle , a list of its 50 nearest neighbors is returned by the boards which allows the determination of the local dark matter mass density @xmath15 .",
    "the particle experiences an interaction with its nearest neighbor with a probability given by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "each weak interaction changes the velocities of the two interacting particles . here , due to the lack of a more sophisticated theory ,",
    "we assume that the interaction cross section is isotropic and that the interaction is completely elastic . in this case",
    ", the directions of the velocity vectors after the interaction are randomly chosen and their absolute values are completely determined by the requirement of energy and momentum conservation .",
    "the computational timestep @xmath19 must be chosen small enough in order to guarantee that the evolution is independent of the numerical parameters , that is the adopted timestep and the number of particles .",
    "otherwise , particles with large velocities could penetrate too deeply into a dense region like the core of a dark matter halo , violating the requirement @xmath23 .",
    "test calculations have shown that @xmath24 with @xmath25 leads to reliable results that are independent of the numerical parameters .",
    "cold dark matter halos form on dynamical timescales . if @xmath6 is small enough",
    ", the halos will achieve an equilibrium state within a few dynamical timescales that is determined by collisionless dynamics alone , before self - interaction becomes important .",
    "the structure of the halos subsequently changes due to self - interaction on longer timescales .",
    "this secular evolution is similar to the long - term evolution of globular clusters which experience core collapse due to gravitational 2-body encounters after virialization .",
    "we start with an equilibrium model of a virialized dark matter halo and study its secular dynamical evolution due to weak self - interaction using the mcn - method . as initial condition ,",
    "a hernquist halo model ( hernquist 1990 ) is adopted .",
    "its density distribution is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the scale density and scale radius , respectively .",
    "the mass profile is @xmath29 with @xmath30 the finite total halo mass .",
    "assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and an isotropic velocity distribution , the velocity dispersion is zero at the center and increases outwards , reaching a maximum at the inversion radius @xmath31 outside of which it decreases again .",
    "a similar structure is seen in cosmological simulations ( carlberg 1994 , fukushige & makino 1997 ) . in general , within the interesting region @xmath32 the hernquist model provides an excellent fit to the structure of cold dark matter halos that result from high - resolution cosmological models . only in the outermost regions",
    "do the dark matter halo profiles deviate significantly from the hernquist model , predicting a density distribution that decreases as @xmath33 and a dark halo mass that diverges logarithmically ( navarro _ et al .",
    "note , that our model neglects any clumpy substructure that might exist within dark matter halos ( moore _ et al .",
    "this should be a reasonable approximation for the inner regions where satellites are efficiently disrupted by tidal forces .",
    "the evolution of weakly self - interacting , clumpy dark halos will be presented in a subsequent paper ( see also moore et al . 2000 ) .    in the following",
    ", we will adopt dimensionless units : g=1 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the total mass and the mean mass density within the inversion radius @xmath36 is @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , leading to a dynamical timescale within @xmath36 of @xmath39 .",
    "most numerical calculations have been performed adopting 80000 particles and a gravitational softening length of @xmath40 = 0.002@xmath41r@xmath42 .",
    "test calculations with 120000 particles did not change the results .",
    "n - body calculations without weak interaction have shown that the dark halo is stable and its density distribution does not change outside of r @xmath43 0.006@xmath41r@xmath42 within 20 dynamical timescales .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of the dark matter density distribution and the velocity dispersion profile inside the core region , adopting a collision cross section @xmath6=10@xmath41r@xmath44/m@xmath42 .",
    "the density distribution initially has the characteristic power - law cusp and the velocity dispersion decreases towards the center for @xmath45 . within this region ,",
    "the kinetic temperature inversion leads to heat conduction inwards .",
    "the central velocity dispersion increases with time and the core expands , resulting in a shallower density distribution .",
    "after 3 dynamical timescales , an isothermal , constant density core has formed with a radius that is of order the initial inversion radius @xmath46 .",
    "subsequently , weak interactions between the kinematically hotter core and the cooler envelope lead to a flow of kinetic energy outwards which causes the isothermal core to contract and heat up further due to its negative specific heat , starting a core collapse phase .",
    "the calculations are stopped after 16 dynamical timescales when the central density and the central velocity dispersion has increased further by a factor of 4 and 1.4 , respectively . note that during the core collapse phase , the system maintains an isothermal , constant density core with the core radius decreasing with time .",
    "overall , the evolution of the dark halo is very similar to the secular evolution of particle systems with hernquist profiles that are affected by gravitational 2-body interactions ( heggie _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , quinlan 1999 ) .",
    "several calculations with different interaction cross sections @xmath6 have been performed . in all cases ,",
    "the evolution is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "1 , independent of the adopted collision cross section . the timescale @xmath47 for",
    "the formation of the isothermal constant density core does however depend on @xmath6 with    @xmath48    in agreement with the calculations of quinlan ( 1999 ) the core collapse timescales are roughly an order of magnitude larger than @xmath47 .",
    "observations of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies show a characteristic dark matter core structure that can be fitted well by the empirical density distribution ( burkert 1995 ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the isothermal core density and radius , respectively .",
    "figure 2 compares this profile ( solid line ) with the core structure of weakly interacting dark halos at @xmath52 ( dashed line ) and after core expansion at @xmath53 ( points with error bars ) .",
    "it is well known that power - law cores do not provide a good fit to the observations .",
    "an excellent agreement can however be achieved after core expansion if one adopts the following core parameters    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the initial dark matter mass inside the inversion radius r@xmath56 .",
    "the previous mcn calculations have shown that isothermal cores with shallow density profiles form naturally in weakly interacting dark halos .",
    "the cores have density distributions that are in excellent agreement with the observations of dark matter rotation curves in dwarf galaxies .",
    "the core size is determined by the radius r@xmath56 inside which heat is conducted inwards , that is where the initial velocity dispersion decreases towards the center .",
    "note , that this conclusion should be valid , independent of whether the density diverges as @xmath57 or even steeper ( moore _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , jing & suto 2000 ) for r @xmath58 .",
    "a quantitatively comparison with the observations requires the determination of the typical scale parameters r@xmath42 and m@xmath42 for dark matter halos .",
    "recent cosmological @xmath4cdm models ( navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) predict that cold dark matter halos with total masses m@xmath59 m@xmath12 should have concentrations c = r@xmath60/r@xmath61 , where m@xmath60 is the total dark matter mass within the virial radius r@xmath60 which denotes the radius inside which the averaged overdensity of dark matter is 200 times the critical density of the universe . adopting a hubble constant h=0.7 leads to r@xmath60 = 0.02 ( m@xmath60/m@xmath62 kpc @xmath63 40  200 kpc and with c=20 to scale radii r@xmath64 2  10 kpc . for a nfw - profile ( navarro _",
    "1997 ) the dark matter mass inside r@xmath42 is m@xmath64 0.1 m@xmath60 and the core density is m@xmath42/r@xmath65 0.01 m@xmath12 pc@xmath66 .",
    "in contrast to the hernquist model with @xmath31 , the inversion radius of the nfw - profiles coincides with the scale radius @xmath67 due to the shallower outer density distribution . according to equation 3 , weak interaction in nfw - halos should therefore lead to isothermal cores with radii r@xmath68 0.6 r@xmath64 1.2  6 kpc and densities @xmath69 1.55 m@xmath42 r@xmath70 m@xmath12 pc@xmath66 .",
    "the observations indicate core radii r@xmath68 2  10 kpc with core densities @xmath69 0.01 m@xmath12 pc@xmath66 ( burkert 1995 ) , in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions .    in order for dark matter cores to be affected by weak self - interaction",
    ", the core expansion timescale must be smaller than the age @xmath71 of the halo : @xmath72 .",
    "with equation ( 2 ) and adopting m@xmath42/r@xmath73m@xmath12 pc@xmath66 , this requirement leads to a minimum value of the collision cross section for weak self - interaction to be important        dark matter halos with @xmath75 are likely to have gone through core collapse if their ages are @xmath76 .",
    "this condition requires the halo core radii to be larger than r@xmath77 ( @xmath2 g@xmath3)/@xmath6 kpc , indicating that more massive halos could have experienced core collapse while lower mass halos could still be in the process of core expansion .",
    "i would like to thank matthew bate for providing a subroutine to find nearest neighbors using grape and paul steinhardt , ben moore and jerry ostriker for interesting discussions and the referee for important comments .",
    "special thanks to david spergel for pointing out the different dependence of the inversion radius on the scale radius for nfw- and hernquist profiles .",
