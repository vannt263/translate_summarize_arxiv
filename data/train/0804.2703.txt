    "electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) was first introduced @xcite as a technique to create a transparency window in an otherwise opaque medium .",
    "years later , fleischhauer and lukin @xcite suggested eit as means for implementing quantum memory for light , i.e. transferring the state of the electromagnetic field to a collective atomic spin excitation .",
    "after the first proof - of - principle experimental realization of this protocol with classical light pulses @xcite , several experimental groups demonstrated that eit - based memory can preserve nonclassical properties of light .",
    "such experiments became possible with the development of quantum light sources with wavelength and bandwidth characteristics enabling strong interaction with the atomic media .",
    "two main approaches have been pursued .",
    "first , the duan - lukin - cirac - zoller procedure @xcite has been used to generate narrowband photons which have then been stored and retrieved using the eit method @xcite .",
    "second , narrowband squeezed vacuum tuned to atomic transitions was created by sub - threshold optical parametric amplifiers ( opas ) @xcite , and used to prove the preservation of squeezing after slow propagation @xcite and storage @xcite .",
    "this last method has also been used recently to preserve the continuous - variable entanglement in light slowed down by an eit medium @xcite .",
    "also , various aspects of the eit interaction for squeezed light have been analyzed @xcite .",
    "special attention has been paid to the excess quadrature noise generated by atoms illuminated by the eit control field @xcite , which was also studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , none of the previous publications on slowdown and storage of continuous - variable optical states reported a satisfactory comparison of theoretical models with experimental data . in this paper",
    "we fill this void by presenting for the first time a full theoretical and experimental study of the transmission of squeezed light through an eit medium both in the continuous - wave and pulsed regimes .",
    "our theoretical model uses a series of spectral and time - domain measurements of the transmission of a classical field under eit in order to fit the standard expression for the linear susceptibility of a 3-level atomic system .",
    "subsequently we use the susceptibility to calculate the effect of propagation through an eit medium of the squeezed vacuum generated by our opa , both in the continuous - wave(cw ) and pulsed cases .",
    "then we perform two experimental tests : in the continuous regime , we measure the quadrature noise spectra of the transmitted squeezed vacuum and , in the pulsed regime , we perform complete quantum - state reconstruction via time - domain homodyne tomography .",
    "the analysis identifies all main sources of degradation of squeezing , enabling us to predict the experimental result with an over 99 % quantum - mechanical fidelity .",
    "+      the eit medium was an atomic @xmath0rb vapor at 65@xmath1c , with a @xmath2 energy level configuration formed by one of the hyperfine sublevels of the @xmath3 state and two hyperfine sublevels of the @xmath4 state ( fig .  1 , inset ) .",
    "the classical signal field , resonant to the @xmath5@xmath6 transition , was provided by a ti : sapphire laser at a wavelength of 795 nm [ fig .",
    "the squeezed vacuum signal was obtained from a sub - threshold cw opa with a bow - tie cavity , employing a 20-mm - long periodically poled ktiopo@xmath7 crystal as the nonlinear element @xcite .",
    "the opa was pumped by the second harmonic of the master ti : sapphire laser and generated a squeezing of approximately 3 db .",
    "the same laser was used as the local oscillator in homodyne detection [ fig .",
    "when required , the signal was chopped into 600-ns ( fwhm ) pulses using a home - made mechanical chopper @xcite .",
    "the control field , interacting with the @xmath8@xmath6 transition , was obtained from an additional diode laser phase locked at 6.834 ghz to the master laser to ensure a two - photon resonance with the signal .",
    "orthogonal , linear polarizations for the control and signal were utilized .",
    "the two fields were focused to a diameter of about 130 @xmath9 m and spatially mode matched inside the rb cell .",
    "the transmission of coherent light through rubidium atoms in the presence of a control field was measured in order to characterize the absorption and dispersion of the medium . assuming a 3-level system , these properties are governed by the linear susceptibility @xmath10 of a doppler broadened gas under eit conditions @xcite . in the above equation , @xmath11 is the control rabi frequency , @xmath12 is the one - photon detuning of the signal field , @xmath13 is the two - photon detuning",
