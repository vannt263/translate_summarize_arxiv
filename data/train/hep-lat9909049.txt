    "the domain - wall fermion formulation of qcd ( dwqcd )  @xcite is expected to realize exact chiral symmetry on the lattice without species doubling at finite lattice spacing .",
    "this represents an appealing possibility , particularly for investigations of problems such as weak matrix elements sensitive to chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a number of studies have been made  @xcite .",
    "simulations in dwqcd , however , requires considerable computing power .",
    "even if the size of the extra dimension @xmath4 can be taken as small , i.e.  @xmath5 , lattice spacings much finer than @xmath6 gev will be difficult to simulate even in quenched qcd .",
    "hence simulations on coarse lattices down to @xmath7  gev will be needed for reliable continuum extrapolations .",
    "a first step in dwqcd at such a strong coupling will be to ensure the existence of chiral zero modes . here",
    "we report our preliminary results on this problem .",
    "our study is made for the plaquette action , and also for an rg - improved action  @xcite to examine the effects of reduced discretization errors .",
    "we employ the fermion action identical to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the domain wall height @xmath8 and bare quark mass @xmath9 .",
    "the gauge coupling is chosen to be @xmath10 for the plaquette action and @xmath11 for the rg action ; these values correspond to the scale @xmath12 gev determined from the string tension .",
    "simulations are made on an @xmath1 lattice with @xmath13 and 50 .    in the free fermion case the chiral zero mode exists over the range @xmath14 . since this range will be shifted in the interacting theory , we employ @xmath15 and 2.5 . for each of these values of @xmath8 , we take @xmath16 and 0.03 and calculate the pion mass for both degenerate and non - degenerate quark and antiquark pairs .",
    "for each parameter point we have typically @xmath17 configurations .",
    "= 7.6 cm = 7.6 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi2-mfns ] the pion mass squared @xmath18 is plotted as a function of the averaged bare quark mass @xmath19 at @xmath20 in the case of the plaquette gauge action .",
    "since the linearity of @xmath18 in @xmath19 is well satisfied , we adopt a linear chiral extrapolation in @xmath19 . as it can be seen in the fig .",
    "[ fig : pi2-mfns ] , we find a non - zero value for @xmath18 at @xmath21 for each @xmath4 .",
    "this non - zero value , however , is expected to vanish exponentially as @xmath22 . to see whether this occurs , we plot @xmath18 at @xmath23 by thick square symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi2-ns](a ) as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "fitting these points by the form @xmath24 yields the dotted line with @xmath25 .",
    "an alternative fit , allowing a constant , @xmath26 gives the solid line with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "clearly the latter fit better reproduces the behavior of our data .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been previously reported also at @xmath29  @xcite .    in order to confirm the existence of a non - zero @xmath30",
    ", we attempt to interchange the order of the limits @xmath31 and @xmath32 . as shown by solid lines going through open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi2-ns](a ) , we first make a fit of form @xmath33 to make an @xmath32 extrapolation for each value of @xmath19 .",
    "the results , shown by solid circles in fig .  [ fig : pi2-mfns ] , exhibits a linear behavior in @xmath19 . a linear chiral extrapolation",
    "@xmath34 then yields @xmath35 , which agrees well with the value of @xmath30 previously obtained .",
    "the commutativity of the two limits is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi2-ns](a ) , where the two values obtained for @xmath36 are marked by `` x '' and `` y '' .",
    "the above analyses strongly support the conclusion that @xmath18 at @xmath21 does not vanish in the limit @xmath37 at @xmath38 1 gev for the 4-dimensional lattice size of @xmath39 .",
    "we find this conclusion to apply as well to the rg - improved gauge action , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi2-ns](b ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi2-m ] the residual @xmath40 is plotted as a function of @xmath8 for the plaquette and rg - improved gauge actions .",
    "we observe that a non - vanishing residual remains under the variation of @xmath8 for both actions .",
    "an improvement may be seen for the rg action , however , in that the magnitude of the residual is reduced by about a factor of two compared to that for the plaquette action .",
    "finally the decay rate @xmath41 extracted from the fits is shown in fig.[fig : dlate - mf ] as a function of @xmath19 at @xmath20 .",
    "for both actions , the chiral extrapolation of @xmath41 from @xmath42 ( open circles ) smoothly agrees with the one directly obtained at @xmath23 assuming @xmath43 ( filled circle ) , but disagrees with the value from the @xmath44 fit .",
    "furthermore the values of @xmath41 varies little with @xmath19 .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the decay rate is governed by the transfer matrix in the extra dimension , which is independent of @xmath9 .",
    "our study of domain - wall qcd with the plaquette gauge action has shown that the pion mass in the chiral limit remains non - zero for an infinitely sized extra dimension at a strong gauge coupling corresponding to @xmath0 1 gev on a @xmath39 lattice .",
    "we have also found that this conclusion remains unchanged for the rg - improved gauge action .",
    "one possibility for the origin of a non - zero pion mass is finite spatial size effects , which is being checked by increasing the spatial size from 12 to 16 .",
    "another possibility is that it is an artifact of the linear chiral extrapolation , which does not take into account the possible presence of quenched chiral logarithms . to explore this possibility",
    ", the chiral breaking term in the axial ward - takahashi identity  @xcite , which we expect to be free from the quenched singularities , is currently being investigated .",
    "finally it is possible that no chiral zero modes exist at @xmath0 1 gev , and therefore the domain - wall formalism fails to realize chiral symmetry in the region of strong coupling . a plausible explanation for this failure might be that the range of @xmath8 for zero modes to exist disappears for stronger couplings , where there is no gap of eigenvalues for the 4-dimensional wilson operator @xcite .",
