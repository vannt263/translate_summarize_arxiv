    "mechanical and radiative feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are beginning to gain attention as important astrophysical processes . by definition ,",
    "active galactic nuclei have strong radiation fields .",
    "they typically possess outflows in the form of spatially - resolved jets on parsec to kiloparsec scales , in both radio - loud ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and radio - quiet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) objects .",
    "uv and x - ray absorption - line probes also point to wide - angle outflows originating from agn on scales of tens of pc or less ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this radiation and outflowing gas deposit mass and energy into the surroundings of the agn , including the ism of the galaxy in which the agn resides and the larger - scale intergalactic and intracluster media .",
    "the possible effects of agn feedback are numerous ; we here list a few important ones .",
    "radiation from quasars almost certainly helped to reionize the universe at high redshift , though the strength of their contribution is yet uncertain @xcite .",
    "outflows from agn have recently been invoked as global heat ( or entropy ) sources for the intracluster medium ( icm ) at both small and large radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "on more local scales , jets from agn at both low and high redshift have been shown to induce star formation by shocking dense clouds of gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "very recently , @xcite have suggested that agn feedback can quench star formation in massive , gas - rich mergers , creating a population of very red ellipticals and possibly explaining the observed bimodal color distribution observed in deep galaxy surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this work will focus on wide - angle outflows ( though this will also lead us to some discussion of jets ) . by ` wide - angle outflows ' , we mean outflows that subtend large solid angles as seen from the wind s origin .",
    "they are thus structurally distinct from jets , in that jets are highly collimated .",
    "the narrow - line regions ( nlrs ) and host galaxies of agn often host large - scale , wide - angle outflows .",
    "( for a recent summary , see @xcite . )",
    "radio continuum , optical emission - line , and x - ray emission probes reveal extended structures and kinematic evidence for these types of outflows in many local seyfert galaxies .",
    "a number of surveys have shown that outflows are common , though they disagree on some of the details and on whether or not the agn drives the outflow if a starburst is also present ( @xcite ) .",
    "more intensive studies of individual objects are quite numerous ( e.g. , @xcite [ ngc  1068 ] ; @xcite [ ngc  1365 ] ; @xcite [ ngc  2992 ] ; @xcite [ ngc  4388 ] ) .",
    "the scales of these structures often extend outside of the nlr ( i.e. , @xmath4 kpc ) and are comparable to those found in starburst galaxies .    however , large - scale , wide - angle winds in seyferts are not identical to those found in starbursts .",
    "for instance , the large - scale radio structures in seyferts do not typically line up with the galaxy s minor axis @xcite .",
    "however , neither do they align with the nuclear ` linear ' radio structure @xcite .",
    "since the large - scale structures are wide - angle winds , and the nuclear structures are jet - like , this implies that the jets from the supermassive black hole accretion disk do not directly drive the large - scale winds ( though they may indirectly by injecting energy into the ism ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray emission in these galaxies is thermal , rather than non - thermal synchrotron as expected in a relativistic plasma that could accompany an agn wind or jet @xcite .",
    "different authors have drawn different conclusions about whether or not the agn powers the large - scale winds in seyfert  2s .",
    "@xcite argue for a starburst origin from x - ray imaging and spectroscopy , as do @xcite from their radio survey .",
    "however , the former sample contains only seyfert / starburst composites . in a less biased , multi - wavelength survey ,",
    "@xcite argue for agn jet - heating of the galaxy ism as the driving force of the outflow .",
    "agn influence is also invoked in various individual cases ( see above references for individual galaxies ) .    in galaxies containing both a starburst and a seyfert nucleus ,",
    "the confusion over the source of the outflow arises in the fact that large - scale , wide - angle outflows are also common features of starbursting galaxies . outflows of neutral gas and dust stretching over kiloparsec scales are found in almost all massive , starbursting galaxies in the local universe ( @xcite ; hereafter papers i and ii ) .",
    "these outflows reach projected velocities up to 600  km  s@xmath1  ( and @xmath51000  km  s@xmath1  in one galaxy ) , though most of the gas is at lower velocities ( @xmath6  km  s@xmath1 ) . a large fraction ( 43/78 ) of the galaxies we studied in papers i and ii were starburst - dominated ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , which have total infrared ( and bolometric ) luminosities greater than @xmath7  l_@xmath8 .",
    "many ulirgs also host a strong agn along with a strong starburst .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopy with the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( _ iso _ ) suggests that these agn account for @xmath9 of the galaxies bolometric luminosities @xcite .",
    "these starburst / seyfert composites are the focus of the current paper .",

    "^-1m@xmath0  yr@xmath1 , will also host starburst - driven winds .",
    "however , the dominant agn in these galaxies could have a measurable impact on the outflow . by comparing the properties of outflows in seyfert  1s and 2s with those in starburst - dominated ulirgs ,",
    "we can search for evidence that these outflows are partially powered by the central agn .",
    "the 26-galaxy sample we discuss in this paper consists of 17 seyfert  2 ulirgs , 3 seyfert  2 lirgs ( with @xmath10 ) , and 6 seyfert  1 ulirgs observed in the  d  @xmath11 doublet absorption feature at moderately high spectral resolution ( @xmath12  km  s@xmath1 )",
    ". this feature probes neutral gas , due to its low ionization potential ( 5.1  ev ) . for @xmath13 ,",
    "it is found in the optical .",
    "its high interstellar abundance makes it a good probe of the ism .",
    "blueshifted velocity components in  d  unambiguously indicate the presence of outflowing gas .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  [ sampobs ] , we discuss our sample selection and observations and summarize the data analysis procedures .",
    "we discuss the outflow properties of seyfert  2 ulirgs in  [ sy2 ] and compare to the properties of outflows in infrared - luminous starbursts .",
    "we also study correlations between emission and absorption lines . in  [ sy1 ] we discuss outflows in seyfert  1 ulirgs . mrk  231 is presented as a special case in",
    " [ mrk231 ] , since it possesses both a small - scale and large - scale wind .",
    "we discuss further issues in  [ discuss ] , including the location of the absorbing gas , outflow / galaxy correlations , the global covering factor of the outflows , the gas escape fraction , and the scientific context .",
    " [ summary ] summarizes and concludes .    for all calculations ,",
    "we assume present - day values for the cosmological parameters of @xmath14  km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 and the standard @xmath15 , @xmath16 cosmology .",

    "( the vacuum wavelengths of  d  are 5891.58 and 5897.55   . )",
    "the primary selection criteria for our sample are that the galaxies be optically classified as seyfert galaxies and have high infrared luminosities ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "our sample of infrared - selected seyferts consists of 23 ulirgs and 3 lirgs .",
    "the only redshift criterion is @xmath18 , so that  d  is not redshifted into the near - infrared and the galaxy is not too faint .",
    "all but four galaxies have redshifts less than 0.25 ; the others have redshifts in the range @xmath19 .",

    "using echellette mode , we covered the wavelength range @xmath22   in one exposure at a spectral resolution of 65  km  s@xmath1  fwhm . data were obtained for two targets with the red channel spectrograph on the mmt , also with an echellette grating .",
    "we used a different setup for each run ; during the 2002 december run , we covered the wavelengths @xmath23  , and during the 2003 june run , we covered the wavelengths @xmath24  . in each case",
    "we used a 1@xmath25 slit to achieve a resolution of 87  km  s@xmath1 .",

    "we put these galaxies in the seyfert  2 category despite the visible broad lines .",
    "a final special case is f05189@xmath362524 .",

    "( we ignore the 13 ulirgs from paper  ii with @xmath19 , since they are typically higher in luminosity than the other ulirgs and may have slightly different properties . )",
    "we detect absorbers blueshifted by more than 50  km  s@xmath1  in half of seyfert  2s ( @xmath51% ) . as we discuss in  [ gcf ] , this detection rate reflects the geometry of the outflows , and thus most or all seyfert  2 ulirgs contain large - scale , wide - angle outflows .",

    "this zeroth - order test indicates no strong association of bela in emission lines and neutral outflows .      to further explore the relation between neutral outflowing and ionized gas , in figures  [ fwhmcorr ] and [ fwtmcorr ]",

    "we plot these quantities against each other for all nuclei with winds and only for those in which we observe winds and bela .",
    "finding correlations between these would suggest that bela and large - scale , neutral outflows are , in fact , associated .",
    "we judge those correlations to be significant for which the slope ( @xmath69 ) satisfies @xmath70 and for which pearson s ( parametric ) and spearman s ( non - parametric ) correlation coefficients each show a correlation at @xmath7190% confidence .",
    "noting that there is one galaxy with high v_maxn@xmath42/v_max@xmath41  and fwhm / fw20 ( f05024@xmath361941 ) which could drive a correlation by itself , we require that the correlation exist with and without this galaxy present and that the slopes be consistent .",
    "we find no significant correlations in the starburst galaxies alone ( 38 nuclei with [ ]  data ) .",
    "when the seyfert  2s are added ( 8 nuclei ) , correlations emerge between fwhm ( [ ] ) and v_maxn@xmath42 , both in all the galaxies and in only those nuclei with bela .",

    "the fits to these data and correlation coefficients are listed in table  [ emlcorr ] .",
    "the observation of significant correlations between v_maxn@xmath42  and fwhm ( [ ] ) may suggest a link between the neutral outflow and the nlr in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the starburst galaxies alone do not exhibit these correlations ; it appears that the presence of a seyfert nucleus is necessary .",
    "furthermore , there are no strong correlations between the high - velocity neutral and ionized gas ( the latter is traced by fw20 ) .",
    "since fwhm ( [ ] ) probes the outer part of the nlr ( @xmath73 kpc ) in seyferts , while the higher - velocity gas probably probes much nearer the nucleus @xcite , this may imply that the neutral gas in seyferts is generally located in the ` extended ' nlr of the galaxy .",
    "a caveat is that the dynamics of the core of the [ ]  line are strongly affected by the gravity of the bulge @xcite , and that the gas that contributes to the line emission is not purely outflowing .",
    "however , as figure  [ fwhmcorr ] demonstrates , when galaxies without bela are removed , the scatter in the correlation decreases quite dramatically .",

    "these blueshifts and blue wings surrounding the nucleus are strongly suggestive of a large - scale outflow .",
    "however , given the ambiguous nature of emission - line kinematics in an interacting system where inflow could be present , it would be good to confirm this claim by looking for blueshifted absorption lines .",
    "mrk  231 is the closest galaxy ( by a factor of 2.5 ) in our seyfert  1 sample .",

    "the stellar absorption - line and gaseous narrow - line velocities are consistent with the systemic velocity of the nuclear disk ( to within @xmath10450  km  s@xmath1 ) . in the 8 extra - nuclear bins where we fit the low - velocity  d  line",

    "the nuclear spectrum spills into the spectra of the extended regions due to the wings of the psf .",
    "we confirmed that the newly - discovered , low - velocity absorption is not an artifact of psf smearing by computing the ratio of the equivalent width of the broad , high - velocity component to that of the low - velocity component .",
    "this ratio decreases dramatically away from the three nuclear bins ( by a factor @xmath5100 ) , meaning that the low - velocity absorption occurs over an extended region .",
    "we detect two extended continuum components besides the nuclear component ; these serve as the background illumination for the extended absorbers .",
    "there is an extended baseline component , as well as a peak in continuum flux @xmath105 south of the nucleus .",
    "a bright emission - line region with a liner spectrum is also present near the southern peak , offset slightly towards the nucleus . in general , the extranuclear regions of mrk  231 contain numerous blue star - forming knots with a range of ages ( @xmath5210@xmath106  yr ) .",
    "these knots are especially dense in the southern region in which we detect a second continuum peak and emission - line spectrum , the ` horseshoe ' region of @xcite .",
    "we observe redshifted emission in  d  in the spectrum 2.3  kpc north of the nucleus ( see figure [ mrk231_spec ] ) .",
    "this is not light contamination from the nuclear spectrum , since the emission is not broad and there is no emission in the southern spectra at the same distance from the nucleus .",
    "the observed redshifted velocities match the lower range of blueshifted velocities ; this emission may be resonant scattering from receding gas .",
    "we also observe the blueshifted emission - line wings in [ ] @xmath686548 ,  6583  claimed by @xcite .",
    "there is some uncertainty in this result due to telluric absorption of the [ ] @xmath107  line and to broad h@xmath26 from the nuclear spectrum that contaminates the near - nuclear bins .",

    "there is a probable redshifted counterpart of similar velocity redward of [ ] @xmath107 .",
    "a high - velocity blueshifted component is also seen south of the nucleus by @xcite .      what is the explanation for the gas dynamics in this source ?",
    "the blueshifted absorption lines point to an extended outflow .",
    "consistent with this scenario are the observed blue emission - line wings , line splitting , high - velocity emission - line components , and redshifted  d  emission .",
    "the presence of comparable - velocity blue- and redshifted components in absorption and emission could arise on the approaching and receding sides of a spherical or biconical outflow .",
    "the best interpretation is that of a large - scale , wide - angle wind .",
    "the difference in north and south absorption - line velocities argues against a model for the wind where the absorption arises on the surface of the wind ; in this model , the outflow velocity should be the same at a given radius north or south of the nucleus .",
    "if we assume instead that the absorption arises in the walls of the outflow in the side of the outflow facing our line - of - sight , then the variations can be attributed to projection effects .",
    "consider a model of a constant - velocity , bipolar , wide - angle wind emerging perpendicular to the /co disk .",
    "we can calculate the expected inclination of the disk and opening angle of the outflow from the ratio of the observed maximum velocities north and south of the nucleus .",
    "a reasonable range for this ratio is @xmath110 , using the maximum observed values of @xmath111  km  s@xmath1  and @xmath112  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the resulting calculated disk inclinations ( @xmath113 ) are consistent with those observed @xcite , and the resulting wind opening angles ( @xmath114 ) are consistent with those expected based on observations of local starburst and seyfert  2 outflows @xcite .",
    "because mrk  231 has both a strong starburst and a strong agn , the power source of this wind is ambiguous .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity is larger than in any starburst or seyfert  2 galaxy we observe .",
    "if the wind is agn - powered , the power could come from a wide - angle wind originating at scales of a few to tens of parsec , or could result from a jet dumping energy into the ism of the host galaxy . in 3c  305 , neutral gas with comparable velocities and on similar spatial scales to the outflow in mrk  231 arises as the radio jet interacts with the ism @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a north - south radio jet in this galaxy on scales ranging from tens of pc to tens of kpc @xcite .",
    "this jet is probably perpendicular to the kiloparsec gas disk seen in co @xcite , @xcite , and radio continuum emission @xcite .",
    "the disk has an inclination of @xmath3460@xmath115 @xcite , perhaps close to 45  @xcite , with respect to the plane of the sky and a roughly east - west major axis position angle .",
    "( however , @xcite argue for @xmath116 . )",
    "the northern half of the disk appears to be the near side @xcite , meaning that the jet is approaching from the south and receding to the north .",
    "this is inconsistent with the higher velocities observed north of the nucleus than south of the nucleus , suggesting that the gas dynamics we observe are not directly connected with the jet s motion .",
    "our absorption - line data contain limited information about the galactocentric radius at which the absorption occurs .",
    "a typical method in absorption - line studies is to use photoionization codes to determine the radius .",
    "since we have information on only one transition in a single atomic species , this technique is unavailable to us .",
    "however , by using simple physical arguments and comparing to other data we can make some useful statements .",
    "there are several physical arguments that we can make that the broad absorption lines observed in f07599@xmath216508 and mrk  231 arise at small scales .",
    "first , the high velocities observed ( @xmath117  km  s@xmath1 ) are comparable to emission - line velocities observed in the broad - line region , which extends @xmath520.1  pc from the black hole .",
    "second , the bluest component in the nucleus of mrk  231 is time - variable in both velocity and equivalent width @xcite .",
    "variability on short timescales can imply short distances to the ionizing source @xcite .",
    "third , the mass and energy outflow rates from these nuclei are too large if we assume @xmath118  kpc . for f07599@xmath216508 and mrk  231 , this yields mass outflow rates of several thousand m _  ^-1m@xmath0  yr@xmath1 .",
    "this will move over @xmath119  m_@xmath59  of gas in only 10 million years , which is a substantial disruption .",
    "if these winds are driven by black hole accretion , these mass outflow rates are at least 1000 times the eddington accretion rate for a mass - to - energy conversion efficiency of 0.1 and a bolometric luminosity of 10@xmath120  erg  s@xmath1 ( as in mrk  231 ) .",
    "finally , the whole luminosity of the galaxy would be driving the outflow , since the energy outflow rate ( 10@xmath121  erg  s@xmath1 ) would be comparable to the galaxy s luminosity !",
    "these arguments do not apply to f11119@xmath213257 , whose outflow velocity is much smaller ( @xmath341500  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "indirect evidence , including comparisons with other galaxies in our sample (  [ sy1_ofprop ] ) and with uv and x - ray intrinsic absorbers in seyfert  1s (  [ intabs ] ) , suggests that the absorbers are at small radius ( i.e. , tens of pc or less ) .",
    "we conclude that the nuclear  d  absorbers in our seyfert  1 subsample almost certainly arise on small scales . in calculating the masses , momenta , and energies listed in tables  [ objprop ] and [ avgprop ] , we therefore assume an absorbing radius of 10  pc ( i.e. , in the inner nlr ) .",
    "however , we can not _ rule out _",
    "absorbers on larger scales in the nuclear spectra of these galaxies , since there are isolated cases of broad absorbers @xcite and narrow absorbers @xcite arising on scales of hundreds of pc to tens of kpc .",
    "in fact , larger scale outflows ( powered either by a starburst or the agn ) probably occur in most of these galaxies , as in mrk  231 , but we can not detect them due to limitations in spatial resolution and nuclear contamination .",
    "the absorbers in seyfert  2s have different properties than those in seyfert  1s .",
    "they are similar to the absorbers in starbursts , which lie at kpc radii ( paper  ii ) .",

    "the velocity of this emission is consistent with this interpretation , as it appears to be redshifted roughly 100  km  s@xmath1  from systemic ( matching the velocity of the blueshifted absorbing component nearest to systemic ) .",
    "another potential origin of this emission is scattered light from the broad line region of the nucleus , but we do not observe this signature in other emission lines in this object in the offset spectra .",
    "indirect evidence for kpc outflows in seyfert  2s comes from emission / absorption line correlations .",
    "if the  d  outflow were located in the inner nlr ( @xmath123  pc ) , one might expect a correlation of high - velocity ionized gas ( as parameterized by the full - width at 20%  maximum of the [ ] @xmath37  line ) with the maximum outflow velocity of the neutral gas ( v_max@xmath41 ) .",
    "we do not observe such a correlation (  [ o3corr ] ) .",
    "instead , we observe a correlation between the width of the core of the [ ] @xmath37  line and the lower - velocity neutral gas , which is natural in the case of a wind arising in the ` extended ' nlr ( @xmath124  kpc ) .      in paper",
    "ii , we studied outflow properties as a function of galaxy properties in our sample of 78 infrared - luminous starbursts .",
    "we also included  d  observations of four dwarf starbursts @xcite .",
    "we found an increase in outflow velocity , mass , momentum , and energy as a galaxy s star formation rate , luminosity , and circular velocity ( mass ) increase .",
    "the increases in outflow velocity , mass , etc .",
    "with sfr are natural in a model where the ram pressure of supernova - heated gas drives ambient material out of the starburst .",
    "radiation pressure probably also plays a role , given the high luminosity and dustiness of many of these galaxies .",
    "however , its momentum input at a given infrared luminosity is an order of magnitude less than that from star formation .",
    "thus , supernovae - heated gas is _ necessary _ to power the outflows observed in many objects .    in paper",
    "ii , we also showed that these trends of outflow properties with galaxy properties become shallow or disappear at high values of sfr , luminosity , and @xmath125 ( i.e. , in the ulirg population ) .",
    "we can not conclusively demonstrate why this is so , though there are several possible explanations : ( a ) the entrainment of all available gas clouds ; ( b ) a velocity threshold due to the finite velocity of the hot wind @xcite ; or ( c ) a reduction in thermalization efficiency at high sfr , luminosity , and @xmath126 .",
    "our sample of seyferts is too small to look for correlations , but we can compare the phase - space locations of our seyfert galaxies with those of the starbursts . in figures",
    "@xmath127 , we plot maximum velocity , mass outflow rate , momentum outflow rate , and energy outflow rate vs. infrared luminosity and circular velocity .",
    "all of the seyfert  2 points fall in the regions of these plots populated by starburst ulirgs .",
    "this similarity reinforces the idea that the outflows in seyfert  2 and starburst ulirgs are largely similar ( see also  [ sy2 ] and  [ sb_v_agn ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the momentum and energy injected from the starburst are sufficient to explain the momentum and energy in the outflows in seyfert  2 ulirgs , implying that the contribution from the agn is comparable to or smaller than that from the starburst .",
    "finally , figure [ dedt_v ] again illustrates the point that , on average , seyfert  2s and starbursts have approximately the same mechanical luminosity per unit radiative luminosity ( see  [ sy2_ofprop ] ) .",
    "as we discuss in paper  ii , the detection rate @xmath128 is a function of both the actual frequency of occurrence of winds @xmath129 and the global angular covering factor of the wind , @xmath130 .",
    "the global angular covering factor , or solid angle subtended by the wind , is the product of the large - scale opening angle ( given by c_@xmath131 , a fraction of @xmath132 ) and local clumping ( which we assume to be represented by c_f@xmath46 ) .",
    "the opening angle is given by the detection rate if the frequency of occurrence of winds is 100% , as in starbursts .",
    "the global covering factor is thus @xmath133 ( paper  ii ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "in the more general case , we can set lower limits to @xmath129 and @xmath134 using our detection rate : @xmath135 and @xmath136 .    assuming @xmath137 for seyfert  2s ( as in starbursts of comparable sfr ; paper  ii ) , we measure @xmath138 .",
    "this corresponds to wind opening angles of @xmath139 , consistent with measurements of winds in local seyfert  2s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if instead we assume @xmath140 , then the projected wind opening angles of 360  are inconsistent with measurements .",
    "we thus conclude that winds occur in most seyfert  2s . using the value of @xmath141 listed in table [ avgprop ] , we compute that the average global covering factor of neutral gas in these winds is @xmath142 , close to the value measured in irgs ( paper  ii ) .    for seyfert  1s ,",
    "the detection rate of  d  absorbers ( both broad and narrow ) is @xmath5250%  ( based on this work and @xcite ) , and the average @xmath46 is 0.7 ( table [ avgprop ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath137 for seyfert  1s , we compute @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "this result is consistent with the value of @xmath145 measured from observations of intrinsic , narrow , high - ionization absorption lines in local seyfert  1s @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the lack of observed broad  d  in polarized light in f07599@xmath216508 @xcite , from which we can infer that the global covering factor of  d  absorbers in seyfert  1 ulirgs is not generically of order unity .",
    "there are several seyfert  2 galaxies with very high velocities in our sample .",
    "this means that some of this material , if it is at large enough radius and does not encounter substantial drag from interstellar gas , will escape the galaxy and enter the intergalactic medium .",
    "it is difficult to estimate precise escape velocities for these galaxies .",
    "however , we can make simplifying assumptions that allow us to calculate an ` escape fraction ' of gas .",
    "we consider this illustrative rather than strictly quantitative due to the uncertainties .    as in paper",
    "ii , we assume a singular isothermal , spherical density distribution with a density that truncates at a radius @xmath146 . if the gas absorbs at radius @xmath147 , then the escape velocity is parameterized uniquely by @xmath126 and @xmath148 . our procedure to calculate @xmath149 is as follows : ( a )  to get @xmath126 , use measured values where possible ;",
    "otherwise , use an average from measurements of other ulirgs ( k. dasyra , private communication ) ; ( b )  use @xmath126 to compute @xmath150 ; ( c ) compute the mass outflow rate of gas that has a velocity above @xmath150 ; ( d )  sum @xmath151 and @xmath152 over all galaxies with measured @xmath126 ; and ( e )  divide @xmath153 by @xmath154 .",
    "( note that @xmath155 and @xmath151 are interchangeable in this algorithm ; the values of @xmath149 computed using @xmath155 are comparable to those computed using @xmath151 , but smaller by a factor of 2 . the discrepancy is due to the extra factor of @xmath156 in the definition of @xmath151 ; see paper  ii . )",
    "using this procedure , we measure @xmath157 for the neutral outflowing gas in agn - dominated ulirgs , which is much higher then the value of @xmath3420%  measured for starbursts .",
    "thus , the neutral , dusty outflowing gas in these galaxies may play a significant role in enriching the intergalactic medium at higher redshifts , where the number density of ulirgs is high .",
    "furthermore , the hot free wind that drives the expansion of the large - scale winds in starbursts may also be present in these systems .",
    "this gas is metal - enriched and has more specific energy than the neutral phase .",
    "it is hence more likely to escape the galaxy and enter the igm .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results to those found in uv and x - ray absorption - line studies of local ( @xmath158 ) , moderate - luminosity ( log@xmath159 \\sim 10 - 12 $ ] ) seyfert  1s .",
    "the observed intrinsic ( or ` warm ' in the x - ray case ) absorbers in these galaxies probably arise on scales of tens of pc or smaller and are thus powered by the agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "finally , the distribution of velocities in intrinsic absorbers ( ranging up to 2300  km  s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) is broadly consistent with what we measure in  d  in seyfert  2s ( figure [ histdv ] ) and in one seyfert  1 , f11119@xmath213257 . in the uv",
    ", the majority of observed components ( 75% ) have @xmath163  km  s@xmath1 , and there are some redshifted components with velocities up to 200  km  s@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "out of 14 x - ray ` warm absorbers ' modeled in @xcite , 10 have velocities less than 1000  km  s@xmath1 , though there are no redshifted components .",
    "however , the distribution of fwhm in uv absorbers is not consistent with our measurements .",
    "most of uv absorbers ( 80% ) have fhwm  @xmath164  100  km  s@xmath1  @xcite , while the average  d  fwhm in seyfert  2 ulirgs is 400  km  s@xmath1  ( table  [ avgprop ] and figure  [ histdv ] ) . in the x - ray the situation is less clear , as most components are unresolved ( fwhm  @xmath165  km  s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this difference , as well as the conclusion that  d  absorbers in seyfert  2s are located at galactocentric radii of @xmath4  kpc (  [ radius ] ) , suggest that the neutral absorbers are not directly related to seyfert  1 intrinsic absorbers",
    ". however , the lines we observe in f11119@xmath213257 could be an optical manifestation of intrinsic absorbers .",
    "the  d  components in this galaxy are high in velocity and covering fraction and low in velocity width (  [ sy1_ofprop ] and table  [ compprop ] ) .",
    "most ulirgs are in the late phase of a merger between two massive , gas - rich galaxies @xcite .",
    "we showed in paper  ii that the detection rate of outflows in ulirgs does not obviously depend on merger phase .",
    "there is some variation of outflow velocity with interaction class , but our sample size is too small to show that this is significant . adding the seyfert  2s to the starburst sample does not change the conclusions of paper  ii in this regard .",
    "seyfert ulirgs are on average later in the stages of merging than starburst - dominated ulirgs @xcite .",
    "we now discuss our observations in light of the mechanisms by which they may be removing the obscuring dust screen surrounding the agn and evolving into optical quasars or radio galaxies .",
    "orientation - based models and evolutionary models compete to describe the properties of broad absorption lines ( bals ) found in quasars .",
    "the latter are meaningful in the context of ulirgs , as bal outflows could be a mechanism for removing the screen of dust surrounding ulirg nuclei , converting them from obscured agn to bright quasars .",
    "out of ten seyfert  1 ulirgs observed by us and @xcite , at least four are low - ionization bal quasars ( lobalqsos ; @xcite ) .",
    "two or three of these ten possess bals in  d  ( f07599@xmath216508 , mrk  231 , and possibly f17002@xmath215153 ) , and two others possess narrow  d  absorption ( f11119@xmath213257 and f14026@xmath214341 ) .",
    "lobalqsos are more common in ir - selected than optically - selected quasar samples ( 27%  vs. 1.4% ; @xcite ) .",
    "as we show , they are apparently even more common in ulirg samples , with a detection rate of @xmath166 .",
    "the lobalqsos as a class have a number of unique properties .",
    "these include weak [ ] @xmath37  @xcite , strong lines @xcite , red continua @xcite , and relatively weak x - ray flux and/or high absorbing columns @xcite .",
    "it has been hypothesized that lobalqsos have high global covering factors , and that ir - luminous lobalqsos may represent a stage in the life of quasar when the nucleus is enshrouded in dust and is in the process of destroying this screen via fast outflows .",
    "thus , lobalqsos may be an evolutionary stage in the proposed scenario by which some quasars are formed from major mergers . in this scenario dust - enshrouded ulirgs",
    "are an intermediate stage between the merger and a quasar .",
    "this scenario does not conflict with recent sub - mm observations showing that balqsos and qsos have similar dust properties @xcite , since most of the balqsos observed were not lobalqsos .",
    "the merger - to - lobalqso - to - qso model is also consistent with our measurement of the global covering factor of  d - absorbing gas in seyfert  1 ulirgs ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "galaxies may also undergo a radio - loud stage in the evolution from a merger remnant to an unobscured qso .",
    "young , massive , and reddened stellar populations ( ages @xmath168  gyr ) are observed in a number of radio galaxies on kpc scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the radio jets in these galaxies could be triggered by a massive merger that funnels gas to the nucleus and feeds the central black hole ; given the observed stellar ages , the jet turns on late in the merger sequence @xcite . in a number of radio galaxies ,",

    "an eighth galaxy with a lower radio flux ( f04210@xmath210401 ) also possesses a radio jet . out of these eight galaxies with high radio fluxes and/or jets ,",
    "we observe outflows in  d  in 4 objects , and in 3 of the 6 galaxies with known jets ( see table [ ofprop ] ) .",
    "4c  12.50 is interesting because it is the one seyfert  2 galaxy in our sample with both a powerful , extended radio jet and a  d  outflow .",
    "this galaxy has single - dish and very - long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) observations @xcite and previous long - slit optical observations @xcite with which to compare our data .",
    "the component seen in the western nucleus with vlbi @xcite and the average optical emission - line peak redshift agree to within a few tens of km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that the high - velocity blue wings in the recombination and forbidden lines @xcite are in fact high - velocity outflowing gas .",
    "we measure the peaks of these emission lines along a pa of 104  ( the line connecting the two nuclei ) , and our results are in quantitative agreement with those of @xcite .    in our analysis (  [ analysis ] ) , we extracted the light in this galaxy using two apertures , one for each nucleus , yielding a @xmath172 outflow in the eastern nucleus .",
    "an extraction with more apertures confirms this picture .",
    "there is gas blueshifted by @xmath34@xmath173  km  s@xmath1  from the emission - line peaks over a region extending at least 10  kpc eastward of the eastern nucleus .",
    "these velocities do not reach those of the high - velocity gas ( @xmath174  km  s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) seen in single - dish data , so it is unclear whether they are related .",

    "there is no clear link between the jet and either the outflow @xcite or the  d  outflow ; further observations are needed .",
    "the seyfert  1 mrk  231 also possesses a radio jet on scales of tens of pc to tens of kpc ( see  [ mrk231 ] ) .",
    "this galaxy has neutral and ionized gas outflows on kpc scales at velocities up to @xmath522100  km  s@xmath1 , along the same axis as the radio jet .",
    "thus , mrk  231 may be a ulirg analogue to the radio galaxies with young stellar populations that are experiencing high - velocity outflow seen in , and could serve as an evolutionary link between the two .",
    "it could represent a stage where the radio jet and corresponding neutral gas outflow have recently removed the dust screen from the galaxy s active nucleus .",
    "low - resolution _ very large array _",
    "observations of the nucleus at the velocities of the bals have not revealed any absorption in mrk  231 @xcite , but sensitive , broad - band , single - dish data just blueward of systemic do not exist for this galaxy ( i.e. , to study the extended absorbing gas ) .",
    "clearly , a sensitive broad - band search for absorption in radio - loud seyfert ulirgs is in order to better study the connection between  d  outflows in ulirgs and outflows in radio galaxies , as well as the implications for the evolutionary link between mergers , radio galaxies , and quasars .",
    "mrk  231 would be an excellent target to begin this search .",
    "is there evidence from our data that agn help to power large - scale , wide - angle outflows in seyfert  1 and 2 ulirgs ?",
    "the fact that the infrared luminosities of many of these galaxies may be dominated by ( dust - reprocessed ) radiation from an agn rather than a starburst does not a priori imply that the outflows we observe in  d  are agn - driven .",
    "the star formation rates in these galaxies are still high ( @xmath2100  m _  ^-1m@xmath0  yr@xmath1 ) , and thus a starburst should be able to power an outflow on its own .",
    "the broad absorption lines we observe in two seyfert  1 galaxies ( f07599@xmath216508 and mrk  231 ) are unique , as these types of profiles are not found in pure starbursts and belong to the class of bals found only in quasars .",
    "these lines are most likely produced in or near the broad - line region of the agn (  [ radius ] ) .",
    "the properties of the narrow , low - velocity ( @xmath175  km  s@xmath1 ) lines in f11119@xmath213257 are similar to uv and x - ray intrinsic absorbers in local seyfert  1s and different from absorbers in starburst ulirgs (   [ sy1_ofprop ] and [ intabs ] ) .",
    "they are thus probably powered by the agn , as well .",
    "the large - scale outflow components in mrk  231 may be either starburst- or agn - driven . the high velocities observed ( @xmath176  km  s@xmath1 ) and the presence of a strong jet suggest that the agn may play some role , though there is certainly a starburst contribution , as well .    in short ,",
    "the dominant contribution to  d  absorbers in nuclear spectra of seyfert  1s is from the agn ; on larger scales , both the agn and a nuclear starburst may play a role . as we show for seyfert  2s , disentangling the contribution of the two on these scales is difficult .",
    "we have shown above that the properties of outflows in seyfert  2s are statistically consistent with those in starburst galaxies (  [ sy2_ofprop ] ) .",

    "the two - dimensional phase - space distributions of starbursts and seyfert  2s relating outflow and galaxy properties are essentially indistinguishable , as well (  [ v_host ] ) .",
    "thus , the effect of agn on outflows in seyfert  2s is difficult to ascertain ; more observations are required .",
    "certainly we can say that the momentum and energy contribution to the large - scale outflow from the agn is comparable to or smaller than the energy contribution from the circumnuclear starburst also present in seyfert  2 ulirgs .",
    "( we assume that there are already powerful starburst - driven winds in these galaxies , as expected based on their star formation rates and the results of paper  ii ) .",

    "two arguments provide some evidence for energy injection into the wind from an agn .",

    "two of the seyfert galaxies in our sample ( mrk  231 and 4c  12.50 ) also host strong radio jets and outflows in  d. the latter contains a high - velocity outflow observed in 21  cm @xcite , which in other radio galaxies is observed to be powered by a radio jet .",
    "jets may turn on late in the merger sequence in some ulirgs as they evolve into unobscured quasars .",
    "the average fraction of neutral outflowing gas that escapes seyfert  2s and enters the igm is non - negligible , perhaps as high as 60% .",
    "thus , agn - dominated ulirgs are more likely to pollute the intergalactic medium with gas and energy than the starburst - dominated ulirgs .",
    "these outflows will be metal - enriched because of the strong starbursts present in these seyferts .    *",
    "( 6 ) * * outlook . *",
    "since outflows in seyfert  2 ulirgs receive substantial momentum and energy injection from a circumnuclear starburst , it would clearly be useful to observe a sample of seyferts in which the starburst component is minimal in order to better study energy injection from the agn .",
    "observing seyferts selected by nuclear x - ray , radio , and/or optical luminosity would allow us to study the absorption - line phase of outflows in a sample of seyferts that is less biased towards starbursting galaxies .",
    "it would be especially useful to compare to a set of galaxies which have well - studied narrow - line regions in emission and/or uv and x - ray absorbers .",
    "ideally , one would also want to select a sample at similar redshifts to those observed here in order to minimize aperture effects .",
    "another follow - up study suggested by this work is to survey radio - loud seyferts with  d  outflows using sensitive , broad - band 21  cm observations",
    ". this may be one way to directly connect neutral na to outflowing and confirm our outflow mass estimates , as well as to illuminate the physics of energy injection ( since radio sources can be studied at high angular resolution ) .",
    "mrk  231 is a particularly appealing target for this type of study .",

    "no continuum is visible , but several emission lines ( elongated and tilted ) are , yielding @xmath185 . [ ] @xmath107  is not visible but h@xmath26 is , suggesting flux(h@xmath26 ) @xmath186 flux ( [ ] ) .",

    "it is difficult to discern the situation in the east nucleus due to its small separation from the west nucleus , which makes separation of the emission lines from the two nuclei very hard .",
    "however , the optical continuum appears to peak in the east nucleus .",

    "<S> the evidence we find is lower wind detection rates ( i.e. , wind opening angles ) in seyfert  2 ulirgs than in galaxies of comparable l_@xmath3 , higher velocities than in galaxies of comparable sfr , and correlations between the neutral gas and the ionized gas in the extended narrow - line region . though the agn probably contributes to the outflows in seyfert  2 ulirgs , its momentum and energy injection is equal to or less than that of the starburst . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the outflow mechanical luminosity ( energy outflow rate ) per unit radiative luminosity is the same for starburst and seyfert  2 ulirgs . in the nuclei of seyfert  1s </S>",

    "<S> the latter may be powered by a starburst or radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> these large - scale , lower - velocity outflows certainly exist in other seyfert  1 ulirgs , but they are washed out by the light of the nucleus . </S>"
