    "the age distribution of elliptical galaxies remains a central topic in galaxy evolution . for many years",
    "ellipticals were viewed as old systems which formed as the result of a short and intense burst of star formation ( baade 1957 , sandage 1986 ) , after which the stars within them passively evolved .",
    "strong observational support for this view came from old and coeval ellipticals found in rich clusters at low ( bower lucey & ellis 1992 ) and high redshifts ( ellis 1997 , stanford 1997 ) .",
    "however , in hierarchical models of galaxy formation dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) , elliptical galaxies form over a longer period , as the result of mergers between low mass disks ( kauffmann 1996 , baugh 1996 ) . in these models clusters",
    "form from the highest peaks of the density fluctuations , so the existence of old , coeval cluster ellipticals is not necessarily in contradiction with hierarchical models .",
    "clearly , regions of high density are poorly suited for testing models for elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "the controversy regarding the epoch of formation of elliptical galaxies has prompted several observational campaigns designed to establish whether field ellipticals share the same evolutionary history as their clustered counterparts .",
    "recent tests have focused on the very red optical - ir colours predicted by single - collapse models .",
    "zepf ( 1997 ) and barger ( 1998 ) adopted a colour - based approach by searching for a very red tail in the optical - ir colour distribution of faint hdf galaxies .",
    "very few sources were found with colours matching those expected for high redshifts of formation .",
    "similarly , menanteau ( 1999 ) , using a statistically - complete sample of morphologically - selected spheroidals from hubble space telescope ( hst ) archival data , concluded on the basis of optical - infrared colours that field ellipticals can not have formed the bulk of their stars in a single - burst of formation at a high redshift .",
    "however , an early period of collapse may be rescued if massive systems subsequently suffer minor episodes of star formation rendering the observed colours bluer than the limits explored in the above observational studies .",
    "jimnez ( 1998 ) propose a multi - zone model of spheroidal formation which predicts bluer colours over the redshift range explored .",
    "this is consistent with recent studies by abraham ( 1999 ) and kodama , bower & bell ( 1998 , hereafter kbb ) which found a large fraction ( @xmath8 ) of spheroidals have properties which differ from those predicted by single - collapse high - redshift models .",
    "more recently tamura ( 2000 ) studied the origin of colour gradients in bright elliptical galaxies in the northern hdf where they report a similar fraction ( @xmath8 ) of systems with blue integrated colours .",
    "however , they claim that colour gradients are very small and originated by stellar metallicity .",
    "the ability of hst to resolve distant galaxies , and the very deep multi - colour photometry available in the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ) , opens up new possibilities for probing the internal characteristics of distant galaxies . in this paper",
    "we adopt a methodology similar to that used in abraham ( 1999 ) , where the spatially - resolved colours of galaxies of known redshift in the northern hdf were used to probe their star - formation history .",
    "we improve on abraham ( 1999 ) by comparing the internal properties of field spheroidal with their clustered counterparts and by enlarging the sample of early type galaxies by a factor of 6 , including the incorporation of high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) data from the southern hdf .    a plan for the paper follows . in @xmath9[sample - sec ]",
    "we present the field and cluster spheroidal sample . in @xmath9[model - free - sec ] we introduce the principles of our methodology and discuss our results and their implications for the evolution of spheroidals under a free - model approach . in @xmath9[model - sec ]",
    "we attempt to model the observed colour dispersions , estimate the corresponding time - scales for the star - formation activity and compute the present sfr for spheroidals from the hdfs . in @xmath9[conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ) provide our primary sample of field faint spheroidals . in the present paper sources in the hdf fields",
    "are designated using the iau ids given in version 2 of the hdf sextractor catalogues constructed by the space telescope science institute .",
    "vega magnitudes are used throughout this paper .",
    "hdf galaxies were morphologically classified using both the automated methodology described in menanteau ( 1999 ) ( based on both , the central concentration ( @xmath10 ) and asymmetry ( @xmath11 ) parameters from abraham 1996 ) , as well as using the visual classifications made by one of us ( rse ) .",
    "visual and automated classification have been shown to agree well in previous studies ( eg . brinchmann 1998 ; menanteau 1999 ) .",
    "however , marleau and simard ( 1998 ) claim that a significant fraction of galaxies visually classified as ellipticals in the van der bergh ( 1996 ) morphological catalog of the hdf were disk - dominated galaxies , although most of these systems are fainter than our selection limits .",
    "a limiting magnitude of = 24 mag was adopted , so that information for each galaxy is distributed over a large enough number of pixels to allow us to define meaningful measures of our model - independent estimator that we will describe in section @xmath9[model - free - sec ] .",
    "we augment the spectroscopic redshifts in our sample using photometric redshift estimates kindly provided by s. gwyn ( gwyn 2000 in preparation ) .",
    "photometric redshifts play a particularly important role in the southern hdf field , where the published spectroscopic data is presently rather limited .",
    "our final sample consists of 79 spheroidal galaxies , 24 of which have spectroscopic redshifts and 55 of which have photometric redshifts .",
    ".the hst cluster sample [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have exploited hst s unique capabilities to resolve distant galaxies by examining the internal colour distribution of a sample of 79 field spheroidals in both hubble deep fields . from a model - independent analysis of our data ,",
    "we find :    @xmath12 a significant fraction ( @xmath1330% ) of field spheroidals show marked variations in their internal colours . in most of the cases where colour variations are seen ,",
    "this manifests itself in terms of centrally - located blue cores .",
    "@xmath12 using a statistic , @xmath14 , to characterise the internal homogeneity of a galaxy we have extended our analysis to permit a comparison of the internal variations found in the hdf sample with that for a sample of spheroidal galaxies in five rich clusters spanning a similar redshift range .",
    "marked differences are found in the sense that galaxies of the same luminosity and redshift are consistently more uniform in rich clusters than in the field . assuming the blue colours located in the hdf field ellipticals arise from recent star formation , our comparison provides strong evidence for more extended star formation histories in field ellipticals ( as expected in hierarchical models ) .",
    "@xmath12 we compare our observational diagnostics with those used by other workers and find general agreement",
    ". the most straightforward interpretation of our data is that a fraction of field spheroidals at intermediate redshift has undergone recent star formation , perhaps as a result of recent merging or an inflow of material .    using spectral synthesis models and a maximum likelihood analysis developed by abraham ( 1999 ) we attempt to reproduced the observed colour variations for the field spheroidals and to compute their current sfr . from this model - dependent analysis",
    "we find that :    @xmath12 assuming that the observed blue nuclei observed in some field spheroidals arises from a recent burst of star - formation superposed on a pre - existing old stellar population , we can readily reproduce the observed distribution of values .",
    "the star formation episodes implied are short , lasting less that 1  gyr , and typically involve 15% of the galactic mass .",
    "@xmath12 if the hdf fields are representative , the fraction of field ellipticals undergoing activity of this kind could be as high as @xmath15 at @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath12 the contribution to the global sfr density from field spheroidals , whilst uncertain to determine accurately because of the necessary corrections for incompleteness and possible luminosity evolution , appears to rises modestly as a function of redshift in a manner which may connect with the demise in activity associated with morphologically - irregular systems .    with a larger sample , augmented with diagnostic spectroscopy capable of constraining the _ timescale _ of recent activity , it may be possible to strengthen the connection between the declining luminosity density contributed by morphologically - irregular galaxies and the implied continued assembly of field ellipticals .",
    "the goal remains an important one in understanding the origin of the hubble sequence and in defining the role of the environment ( brinchmann & ellis 2000 ) .",
