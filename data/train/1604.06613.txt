    "with the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) a serious effort was mounted to understand nuclei in terms of quarks .",
    "early in the development of this line of inquiry , a nucleous with mass number @xmath6 was conceived as a system of @xmath7 quarks moving in a large bag and forming a shell structure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "were this model experimentally successful , one would regard it as an effective theory to low energy qcd which covers both free hadrons and nuclei .",
    "however , the predicted nuclear magnetic moments differ considerably from their observed values @xcite , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the relationship between the number of quarks @xmath8 that are contained in a stable bag and its size @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 which implies that the link with the liquid drop model , exhibiting the relationship @xmath11 , is lost in this approach .",
    "this seems to be the origin of the discrepance stated by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we thus should proceed from another paradigm .",
    "a direct way for clarifying the properties of a bound many - quark system in the strong - coupling regime is to use the feynman path integral machinery whereby all color degrees of freedom are integrated out , except for those of a single quark @xmath12 , so that this quark is affected by a mean field generated by all other constituents of the system .",
    "a systematic implementation of this calculation program is still a good distance in the future . and yet integrating out the remaining degrees of freedom can be neatly approximated if we make plausible assumptions about the color relief over which the quark @xmath12 travels , and invoke the semiclassical approximation for exploring the behavior of the quark @xmath12 .",
    "this strategy , proposed in @xcite , enables the quarkonium spectra to be found in good agreement with experiment . under a different boundary condition ,",
    "the same procedure makes possible to describe some static properties of nuclei , in particular nuclear sizes characteristic of the liquid drop model .",
    "we will show in the present paper that reasonably accurate values of magnetic moments for a rich variety of nuclei are also attainable in this framework .",
    "the dynamics of the quark @xmath12 , specified by the dirac field @xmath13 , is assumed to be encoded by the lagrangian @xmath14\\psi   + g_s{\\bar\\psi}\\psi\\,\\phi\\ , , \\label { qcd - lagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the lorentz vector- and scalar potential of the mean color field , @xmath17 and @xmath18 their associated couplings , and @xmath19 the current - quark mass of the quark @xmath12 .",
    "the second interaction term in ( [ qcd - lagrangian ] ) is absent from the qcd lagrangian because the scalar yukawa coupling is contrary to asymptotic freedom .",

    "the pseudoscalar coupling @xmath20 is a further fascinating candidate for the color relief , while keeping @xmath21 finite , we find that the dirac equation diagonalizes , so that the system with a pseudoscalar relief enjoys the property of supersymmetry @xcite . ]",
    "whose analysis will be given elsewhere .",
    "the semiclassical treatment implies that the extremal path contribution dominates the feynman path integral .",
    "this is another way of stating that the wave function @xmath22 of the quark @xmath12 is a solution to the dirac equation in the background @xmath23 and @xmath24 because this equation results from the requirement that the action with the lagrangian ( [ qcd - lagrangian ] ) be extremal .",
