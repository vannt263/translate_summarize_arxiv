    "second , planets can not reach a critical mass that is necessary for the onset of runaway gas accretion before dissipation of disk gas , which means that gas giant planets are difficult to be formed .",
    "current theories predict that solid planets grow in proto - planetary disks via runaway growth phase @xcite followed by oligarchic growth phase @xcite , and in both phases , protoplanets grow mainly by capturing objects that are much smaller than the protoplanets . thus , in order to estimate the growth timescale of solid planets , one has to investigate the stage where a large number of small objects are accreted by a small number of large objects .",

    "when the masses of planetesimals and the planet are much smaller than the solar mass and their orbital eccentricities and inclinations are sufficiently small , their motions in a rotating coordinate system can be described by linearized equations , called hill s equations .",
    "we use a coordinate system centered on the planet , where the @xmath2-axis points radially outwards , the @xmath3-axis points in the direction of the planet s orbital motion , and the @xmath4-axis is normal to the @xmath2@xmath3 plane .",
    "we scale the distance by the mutual hill radius @xmath5 with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the masses of the planet and a planetesimal , respectively ; @xmath9 is the semi - major axis of the planet ; and @xmath10 is the mass of the central star ) and the time by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the planet s orbital angular frequency ) . the non - dimensional equation for the relative motion between the planet and a planetesimal can then be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is velocity , @xmath15 is time , and @xmath16 is the hill potential given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 . variables with tildes denote non - dimensional quantities .",
    "the acceleration due to gas drag @xmath19 is described by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the drag force for a planetesimal with radius @xmath22 , @xmath8 is the mass of the planetesimal , @xmath23 is the gas drag coefficient of order unity , @xmath24 is gas density , @xmath25 is the internal density of planetesimals , @xmath26 is the normalized physical radius of the planetesimals , and @xmath27 is the velocity of the objects relative to the gas .      in the present work ,",
    "we assume that the density structure of the atmosphere is spherically symmetric . for sufficiently massive solid protoplanets ( @xmath28 10 earth masses ) ,",
    "runaway gas accretion occurs and the density distribution of the inflowing gas significantly deviates from spherical symmetry .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , in order to study the gas drag effect systematically , we assume a power - law function for the atmospheric structure as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the density at the bottom of the atmosphere , or equivalently , the density at the surface of the solid core , @xmath31 is the distance from the center of the planet , @xmath32 is the radius of the solid part of the planet , and the exponent @xmath33 is assumed to be constant .    for a purely radiative atmosphere with a constant opacity",
    ", the density distribution is given by the above power - law with @xmath34 ( e.g. , @xcite ; see appendix a ) . in more realistic atmospheric structures , on the other hand , the slope of the density distribution changes near the sublimation points of ice and silicate dust , especially when opacity ( or dust / gas ratio ) is large ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and outside of bondi radius where gas is no longer bounded by the planet gravity .",
    "however , the overall structure in most radial regions of atmospheres can still be well approximated by a power - law distribution . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt the above simple model for atmospheric structures in order to examine the effect of atmosphere systematically for a wide range of parameters and to better understand physics behind it .",
    "effects of a more realistic atmospheric structure based on the analytic solution described in @xcite will be discussed in section [ sec_realistic_atmosphere ] .",
    "once a power - law function is assumed for gas density , effects of gas drag can be described by two parameters : the exponent @xmath33 , and the non - dimensional gas drag parameter @xmath35 , which will be defined in the next subsection .",

    "thus @xmath30 , which is a function of the planet mass , can be eliminated from the above equation . using the analytic formula for atmospheric structures given by @xcite",
    ", we found that @xmath45 can be approximated by @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the solar luminosity ) when @xmath43 is around 0.01 .",

    "( [ xi_tmp ] ) yields @xmath50 where we used accretion energy @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the accretion rate of planetesimals onto the planet .",
    "following the definition of collision rate given by @xcite , we define the accretion rate of planetesimals per unit surface number density as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are planetesimals orbital eccentricity and inclination divided by @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the initial value of the normalized semimajor axis of an incoming planetesimal relative to the planet at @xmath58 .",

    "we thus define the following two quantities in a similar way : @xmath65 is the normalized accretion rate due to direct collision with the solid surface of a planet without an atmosphere , which is the definition identical to that of @xcite ; and @xmath66 is the normalized rate of capture of planetesimals within the hill sphere of the planet due to gas drag , with the assumption that the planet is a point mass ( i.e. , direct collision onto the planet is neglected ) .",
    "we also define @xmath67 and @xmath68 in a similar way .",
    "when a planet does not have an atmosphere and the random velocity of planetesimals is large enough , the rate of direct collision onto the solid surface of the planet with radius @xmath32 is analytically given by @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds , respectively , with @xmath72 .",
    "collision probability @xmath67 can be written as @xmath73      without energy dissipation , objects coming into the hill sphere always escape from the sphere in the end unless they collide with the planet , but they can be captured within the hill sphere if there is energy dissipation such as atmospheric gas drag . @xcite introduced `` enhanced radius '' of a planet due to atmospheric gas drag ; planetesimals which come closer than this radius lose a significant amount of kinetic energy and can not escape out of the hill radius , thus it can be regarded as an effective radius of the planet for capturing planetesimals . in the present study , we assume a power - law density distribution for atmosphere , which enables us to obtain the expression for the enhanced radius analytically .",
    "we first estimate energy dissipation of objects that pass through the atmosphere in a way similar to @xcite .",
    "we assume that most of energy dissipation in one encounter occurs near the point of closest approach to the planet , because the gas density increases steeply with decreasing distance from the planet .",
    "we will confirm the validity of this assumption later , using orbital integration (  [ sec_gas_drag ] ) .",
    "energy dissipation due to gas drag @xmath74 is then estimated by the work acting on a unit mass of the object : @xmath75 where @xmath76 ; @xmath77 is the path length of the orbit near the point of closest approach and is substituted by @xmath78 ( @xmath79 is a correction factor of order unity , and @xmath80 is the minimum distance from the origin ) ; and @xmath81 is the relative velocity between the planet and an approaching planetesimal before acceleration due to the planet s gravity .",
    "when the relative velocity is dominated by the random velocity rather than kepler shear , @xmath81 can be approximated by the relative velocity at the origin in the unperturbed , non - gravitating solution to the hill s equation @xcite given as @xmath82    the total specific energy of a particle on the hill coordinate system is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the velocity of the particle , and @xmath85 corresponds to the jacobi integral @xcite .",
    "note that the orbital elements @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath57 in the last expression of eq.([tilde_e ] ) are the initial unperturbed values , thus the term for mutual gravity @xmath86 is neglected in this expression .",
    "since the @xmath87 contour surface is closed , a planetesimal can not escape from the planet s hill sphere , if the total energy @xmath85 becomes negative due to gas drag @xcite .",

    ".    however , the power - law distribution would not be a good approximation at outer region of the atmospheres in some cases .",
    "the density profile fitted by a power - law function at the bottom of an atmosphere tends to underestimate the gas density at the outer region when planet mass is small ( @xmath239 ) and overestimate it when planet mass is large ( @xmath240 ) for typical disk parameters . in the case of small planets , however , the atmosphere is not very effective in capturing planetesimals because it is not massive enough . on the other hand ,",

    "the difference between the results for the atmospheric profiles is rather small in the low - velocity regime with @xmath274 .",

[ fig_ikoma - atmosphere ] ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the assumption of our numerical method ( i.e. , planetesimals move on a keplerian orbit while weakly perturbed by gas drag ) breaks down for such small planetesimals .",
    "their motion is expected to be strongly coupled with the gas flow , and the accretion rate of such small planetesimals is determined by the flow pattern of the nebular gas in the vicinity of a planet , rather than the structure of the atmosphere near the planet s surface .",
    "therefore , the difference in the accretion rates for the two atmospheric profiles is practically negligible in the @xmath273 case , if we take into account the fact that sufficiently small planetesimals are coupled with the gas drag flow .    in summary , the power - law atmospheric density profile is a reasonable approximation for accretion rates of large ( @xmath277 ) protoplanets when planetesimals size is not too small . in the case of @xmath243 ,",
    "the difference of the two atmospheric profiles practically does not cause a significant difference in @xmath159 , if we take account of the fact that the motion of planetesimals with very small sizes ( @xmath1 0.1 m ) are strongly coupled with the nebular gas .",
    "we further note that the outer boundary condition of atmospheres is important for the structure of the outer region of atmospheres , where the difference between realistic density profiles and fitted power - law profiles can be significant , although the inner dense region , which account for most of the atmospheric mass , is insensitive to the boundary condition .",
    "for example , when the temperature of the outer boundary is decreased to 50k , which is a typical disk temperature at 5au for a disk that is optically thin in the vertical direction and optically thick in the horizontal direction , the agreement between the realistic density profile and the fitted power - law function is significantly improved ( see fig .",

    "( ii ) @xcite does not seem to fully take account of the @xmath57-dependence of @xmath89 in obtaining the accretion rate averaged over the rayleigh distribution .",
    "if it is correctly taken into account , this enhances the accretion rate by 1.17 .",
    "( iii ) instead of fully taking account of the @xmath54- and @xmath55-dependence of @xmath89 and the averaging over the rayleigh distribution , @xmath315 seems to have been used in their calculation of @xmath182 .",
    "if we fully take account of this , the accretion rate is enhanced by about 1.6 .",

    "[ fig_compare_with_ii03 ] , thus we believe that the difference comes from the three factors described above .",
    "based on the consideration , we can deduce the reason why the two accretion rates in the low velocity regime roughly agree with each other . as described above , two causes out of the three are related to the dependence of @xmath89 on @xmath319 and @xmath57 , while @xmath89 does not depend on them in the low velocity regime .",

    "<S> when protoplanets growing by accretion of planetesimals have atmospheres , small planetesimals approaching the protoplanets lose their energy by gas drag from the atmospheres , which leads them to be captured within the hill sphere of the protoplanets . as a result , growth rates of the protoplanets are enhanced . in order to study the effect of an atmosphere on planetary growth rates , we performed numerical integration of orbits of planetesimals for a wide range of orbital elements and obtained the effective accretion rates of planetesimals onto planets that have atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are obtained as a function of planetesimals eccentricity , inclination , planet s radius , and non - dimensional gas - drag parameters which can be expressed by several physical quantities such as the radius of planetesimals and the mass of the protoplanet . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the radial distribution of the gas density near the surface can be approximated by a power - law , we performed analytic calculation for the loss of planetesimals kinetic energy due to gas drag , and confirmed agreement with numerical results . </S>",
