    "one of the most exciting areas of physics is the study of mesoscopic electronic systems , i.e. metal or semiconductor samples which are sufficiently small and at sufficiently low temperature , such that inelastic electron - phonon scattering is reduced and the electron propagates as a phase coherent wave throughout the entire sample @xcite .    recently in a series of papers @xcite we discussed a possibility of spontaneous persistent currents in relatively clean ( ballistic regime ) metallic or semiconducting systems of cylindrical geometry .",
    "it was shown in the mean field approximation ( mfa ) that the inclusion of the magnetostatic interaction among electrons can lead to an ordered ground state with spontaneous self - sustaining orbital currents which run without support of external magnetic field .    in our investigations we considered a collection of many mesoscopic rings with a thickness @xmath1 , ( @xmath2 is the radius of the ring ) stacked along @xmath3 axis and the three - dimensional ( 3d ) mesoscopic cylinder of very small thickness @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to give some justification to the calculation mentioned above , because there was no microscopic theory of this phenomenon till now .",
    "we will examine a microscopic hamiltonian for the magnetostatic ( current - current ) interaction and show that the self - consistent mfa of it gives the effective hamiltonian @xmath4 leading to self - sustaining currents .",
    "we also show that magnetostatic interaction is long - ranged and therefore the criteria of the mfa are met .",
    "the orbital magnetic interaction and its static version , the magnetostatic coupling , has been discussed previously by pines and nozieres @xcite and has been shown to be small in macroscopic metallic samples . however this interaction should be reexamined in mesoscopic systems where the presence of energy gaps in the energy spectrum changes qualitatively its physical properties leading e.g. to persistent currents driven by the static magnetic flux @xmath5 at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "persistent currents create orbital magnetic moments and their interaction can lead to interesting coherent collective phenomena which bear some resemblance to ferromagnetism and to superconductivity @xcite .    to go beyond the mfa and discuss fluctuations we follow the ideas developed by bloch @xcite .",
    "he discussed the problem of quantum coherence in a macroscopic , metallic ring manifested e.g. by the thermodynamically stable flux trapping at zero external magnetic field .",
    "he covers in his paper different long - range characteristics of the normal and the superconductive state of a metal .",
    "irrespective of the specific dynamical properties of the systems he shows that the general criteria for flux trapping are closely related to the mean square fluctuation of the total momentum and depend strongly on the dimensionality of the system .",
    "we will show , using bloch s formulaes that if we reduce the dimensions of a macroscopic cylinder made of a normal metal or semiconductor to mesoscopic dimensions , the system exhibits coherent properties absent in macroscopic samples .",
    "we will formulate the criteria under which flux trapping can be obtained in mesoscopic cylinders with quasi-1d and quasi-2d conduction . in particular we will discuss the mean square fluctuation of the total momentum - the decisive quantity for the characterization of the properties of the system .",
    "we show that it is smaller in mesoscopic systems than in the corresponding macroscopic ones thus favouring quantum coherence .",
    "finally , using the microscopic hamiltonian we discuss the possibility of the long - range order in a mesoscopic cylinder made of a set of mesoscopic rings .",
    "we calculate the correlation length and the characteristic temperature under which the system is in a magnetically ordered state .",
    "the general formula for the magnetostatic interaction is of the form :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the current density , @xmath9 is the momentum of an electron .",
    "let us assume that the currents run in a set of @xmath10 mesoscopic rings of small thickness deposited along @xmath3 axis .",
    "we can write    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is given by a parametric equation for an electron going around the circumference of a ring , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the coordinate along the circumference of the ring , @xmath15 is the current in the @xmath16-th ring .",
    "we obtain    @xmath17    where    @xmath18",
    "thus we have obtained the interaction hamiltonian of the currents from different rings . in this derivation",
    "we neglected the selfinductance effects in each single ring .",
    "it can easily be seen that they are small .",
    "the interaction constant @xmath19 depends on the sample geometry ; here it has to be calculated for the rings deposited along @xmath3 axis at distance @xmath20 .",

    "we see that the interaction ( [ m11 ] ) is a long - range interaction . for small @xmath3",

    "thermodynamically stable flux trapping is determined by those values of @xmath106 for which @xmath107 has a minimum .",

    "the energy @xmath254 is of the form : @xmath255 the @xmath246 dependence of @xmath254 is presented in fig .",
    "we see that @xmath256 increases with @xmath246 and decreases with @xmath257 .",
    "the smallest energy change is obtained when reversing a direction of a single current in several different places . in fig .",
    "5 we present the @xmath10 dependence of @xmath258 . we see that @xmath258 increases with @xmath10 for small @xmath10 and then saturates .",
    "we are in position now to calculate the temperature @xmath0 at which the crossover from an ordered to disordered state occurs : @xmath259 the calculations performed for the following set of parameters : @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath71 , @xmath262  gave us @xmath263 @xmath264 .",
    "it means that at @xmath265 the system exhibits a long - range order in the sense that the correlation range is longer than the sample size .",
    "the temperature @xmath266 calculated in the mfa for the above set of parameters is @xmath267 .",
    "@xcite    we see that @xmath0 obtained by the use of the ising model is of the same order as @xmath266 obtained with the mfa .",
    "it means that long - range interactions encountered in our system strongly supress fluctuations .",
    "if we assume that each ring has a small number of transverse channels @xmath146 then e.g. for @xmath268 , @xmath269 .",
    "it has to be stress e.g. that finite value of @xmath0 for our system is a finite size effect . indeed , as we can see from eq .",

    "in the presented paper we discussed the magnetostatic coupling of electrons in mesoscopic systems and its approximations .",
    "this interaction is known to be weak in macroscopic samples , however it seems it can play an important role in mesoscopic samples due to very peculiar properties of mesoscopic systems in the magnetic field .",
    "it is possible to induce persistent currents ( or in other words orbital magnetic moments ) in mesoscopic ring by the static magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic interaction of orbital magnetic moments can lead to magnetically ordered ground state .",
    "this possibility has been discussed in a number of papers @xcite using mean field approximation which states that each electron moves in an external magnetic field and the field coming from all currents in a system .",
    "the obtained two self - consistent equations for the current can lead to spontaneous self - sustaining current at zero external field .",
    "we neglected here the zeeman energy of the electron spins because it turns out to be very small compared to the orbital energies .",
    "the influence of spins has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have presented the microscopic hamiltonian which is responsible for the internal magnetic field - the magnetostatic ( current - current ) interaction .",
    "the strength of the interaction depends strongly on the sample geometry . for the stack of mesoscopic rings deposited along certain axis we get the long - range interaction with the coupling constant depending only on the radii of the rings and on the relative distance of its centers .",
    "we have shown that the self - consistent mfa of the current - current interaction , gives the effective hamiltonian @xmath4 leading to self - sustaining currents .",
    "its derivation from the long - range interaction serves as a justification of the use of the hamiltonian ( [ m28 ] ) to investigate magnetic properties of mesoscopic systems .",
    "the mfa is known to be the best for systems with long - range forces ( if the condition ( [ ms ] ) is fulfilled ) , thus we should expect that it leads to reasonable results in the considered case .    to obtain the full hamiltonian describing our system one should add to hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ m19 ] ) the coulomb interaction and the interaction with impurity potential .",
    "it was recently shown that the coulomb interaction does not influence persistent currents in clean systems @xcite , whereas it enhances the current in diffusive regime @xcite . in a work by m. pascaud and g. montambaux @xcite the experiments which permit to test the role of coulomb interaction have been suggested .    in the model calculations presented in this paper",
    "we did not consider the effect of impurities in order not to obscure the whole subject with too many details .",
    "the influence of disorder on self - sustaining currents has been analysed in ref .",
    "we found that disorder decreases persistent currents but self - sustaining currents can still be obtained for relatively clean samples ( ballistic regime ) .    to go beyond the mfa we have considered the influence of fluctuations , calculated by the use of eq .",
    "( [ b24 ] ) , on the properties of a mesoscopic cylinder .",
    "we have shown that these fluctuations are smaller in mesoscopic systems than in macroscopic ones because of the quantum size energy gaps .",
    "on the top of it the magnetostatic coupling modifies a dispertion relation and creates a dynamic gap what leads to further reduction of the fluctuations .",
    "thus in mesoscopic systems coherent and normal electrons coexist and the system can be described by the two - fluid model where the fluctuations are proportional to the amount of normal electrons .",
    "self - sustaining currents run by coherent electrons survive fluctuations in systems with fs having flat regions , however their magnitude is reduced .    having the microscopic hamiltonian for electrons interacting by magnetostatic coupling ( eq .",
    "( [ m11 ] ) ) we have discussed , for a set of stacked rings , the possibility of long - range order .",
    "phase transitions and long - range order are possible in the strict mathematical sense only for systems in the thermodynamic limit . for finite ( but still large ) systems discontinuities of thermodynamic quantities and infinite range correlations are not necessary . ",
    "discontinuities  have finite widths and correlation ranges may be as large as the system itself , regardless of the behaviour in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "what is more finite systems can show interesting effects which will be wiped away in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is the situation in the presented paper where at temperatures @xmath272 the set of mesoscopic rings ( or in general the mesoscopic cylinder with quasi-1d conduction ) can exhibit the long - range order , but @xmath270 for @xmath271 .    the statistical properties of the system following from eq .",
