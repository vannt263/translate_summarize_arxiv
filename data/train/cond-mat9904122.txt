    "[ chapter- coulomb systems ]      the emergence of thermodynamics and of various physical laws from the more fundamental levels of atomic theory and statistical mechanics were high points in our education in physics .",
    "but by the time we reached textbook treatments of the complex world of the coulomb interaction , for example , formation of atoms and molecules and equilibria between them , we learned to demand less from theory and to be more content with reasoning by analogy consistent with thermodynamics .",
    "we know experimentally that atoms and molecules form , that they can behave like mixtures of ideal gases , so phenomenologically they have chemical potentials and we no longer insist that this emerge in some limit from @xmath1-body quantum coulomb systems .",
    "we also know that coulomb systems can have screening and dielectric phases .",
    "but when screening is expected to occur , it is quite a common practice to rather bluntly replace the coulomb potential by a screened potential inherited from mean - field theories without inquiring too deeply into the legitimacy of this change .",
    "likewise , there does not exist a first principle theory of the dielectric constant that does not presuppose the existence of atoms and molecules . at best , assuming that atoms form , one uses several laws , such as the clausius - mosotti formula , whose microscopic foundations have to be elucidated . in all these cases , this is a sensible attitude since most of non - relativistic physics is reputed to be hidden within the @xmath1-particle coulomb hamiltonian . there are however basic facts that can be cleanly formulated as limiting theories and shown to persist near the limit as well .",
    "this review is devoted to these types of results on coulomb systems at low density . at low density",
    "the most famous properties of coulomb systems are related to screening .",
    "the classical debye - hckel theory and its quantum analogue the random phase approximation have been supplemented in recent years by additional information established both by rigorous proofs and by closer inspection of resummed perturbation theory consistent with aspects of the rigorous proofs .",
    "there is also a precise understanding how a dilute assembly of quantum nuclei and electrons can form gases of atoms and molecules in the saha regime .",
    "these results are physically well understood but the challenge to derive them has shown that standard perturbation theories miss some effects ; indeed it turns out that quantum coulomb systems do not screen , in the strong sense that the classical system does .",
    "this is a principal focus of this review .",
    "the first rigorous results were at the level of thermodynamics , the celebrated stability of matter theorem of dyson and lenard and the existence of thermodynamic behavior established by lieb and lebowitz .",
    "they hold for all states of nonrelativistic matter .",
    "the importance of the stability result is that it shows that quantum mechanics and electrostatics is a consistent simplified statistical mechanics of nature that needs no intervention from more fundamental levels of description .    the next level , which is the focus of this review , is to ask for information on correlations : here the variety of physical phenomena in question is so vast that we can not hope for too much generality : thorough consideration of the low density behavior is the first and the most natural step in this direction .    there are three parts .",
    "the first is devoted to classical systems . here",
    "a significant achievement is the proof that the debye - hckel theory is a limiting theory and debye screening holds close to this limit , that is , at sufficiently low density ( or high temperature ) .",
    "this is the subject of chapter  [ chapter- debye - screening ] .",
    "frequently proofs of such results are very long with tedious parts devoid of physical insight , but there are also components where a physical insight becomes a precise argument or where a useful new identity such as a resummation of perturbation theory appears . the philosophy here and throughout the review is to state the theorems and to give only those ideas in the proofs that conform to this specification .",
    "many of these arguments are founded on the sine - gordon transformation , described in chapter  [ chapter- debye - screening ] .",
    "we hope that our applications will raise appreciation for this transformation .",
    "we hope to display enough arguments without overwhelming technicalities to satisfy the physicist curious to see the way between physical concepts and their full mathematical realization .    in the second part we consider quantum mechanics . in between",
    "there is a natural transition chapter ( chapter  [ chapter- dipole ] ) which revolves around the absence of screening in classical dipole systems .",
    "we present the simple proof of this lack of screening .",
    "this chapter prepares for the study of the quantum case because it turns out that the feynman - kac formula reduces quantum equilibrium statistical mechanics to a classical formalism in which both monopoles and higher order multipoles appear .",
    "the proper quantum mechanical effects on screening are exhibited in chapter  [ chapter- semi - classical ] in the simplified framework of the semi - classical approximation .",
    "the well known feynman - kac representation of quantum statistical mechanics is recalled and quantum statistics are neglected .",
    "perturbing around the classical gas makes immediately clear why intrinsic quantum fluctuations always destroy debye screening .",
    "this appears to have been first suggested by federbush , see ( * ? ? ? * , section 5 ) .",
    "one also discovers that the remaining screening mechanisms are more subtle than in the classical case , as revealed by the different long distance behaviors of various types of correlations .",
    "this chapter is intended to be a gentle baptism before the confrontation with the full quantum mechanical setting in chapter  [ chapter - loops ] .",
    "here the mathematics is much harder and less has been proved : in chapters  [ chapter - loops ] and  [ chapter-6 ] the style is that of formal perturbation theory . in these chapters , following mainly the work of alastuey , cornu and collaborators , one exploits the full power of the feynman - kac representation including the quantum statistics . in this language ,",
    "the quantum coulomb gas is similar to a certain classical gas of fluctuating multipoles and all the efficient techniques of classical statistical mechanics are at hand . in particular",
    ", one can perform the usual partial resummations needed to cure the coulomb divergences and end up with well defined mayer - like diagrammatic rules .",
    "this offers a new perturbative scheme for the many - body problem which is particularly suited for low density expansions , in contrast to the standard feynman perturbation theory with respect to the coupling constant .",
    "the formalism is applied in chapter  [ chapter-6 ] to the determination of the long distance behavior of the correlations and to the equation of state at low density .",
    "the ( formally ) exact results presented here provide the most detailed information available now on these questions .",
    "some of them are new , in particular the explicit formulae for the tails of the correlations at low density .",
    "also one recovers and completes the equation of state already obtained by ebeling and coworkers by different methods .",
    "in chapter  [ chapter-7 ] we report on a nice development , initiated by fefferman , on atomic and molecular phases at low density ( the saha regime ) .",
    "one considers a joint limit , the atomic or molecular limit , of vanishing density and vanishing temperature by fixing the chemical potentials ( negatives ) and letting the temperature tend to zero .",
    "lowering the temperature enhances the probabilities for quantum mechanical binding whereas lowering the density favors ionization .",
    "it turns out that in this limit each value of the chemical potentials determines in principle certain chemical species and the system behaves as a mixture of these ideal substances .",
    "ionization equilibrium phases are obtained in this way . in this asymptotic sense",
    ", it gives a precise meaning to the notion of atoms and molecules in the many - body problem .",
    "the third part consists of a single chapter  [ chapter - convergent - expansions ] that is more technical : rigorous results at low density require control of the convergence of various types of cluster expansions .",
    "the proof of debye screening has stimulated the development of resummation techniques which may be useful in other situations .",
    "for example there are new combinatoric formulae for mayer coefficients . without aiming at completeness ,",
    "this last chapter provides the dedicated reader with some arguments left out in the main course of the text and gives an updated summary of some of the available tools in this field .",
    "the considerations in this review are essentially concerned with our three dimensional world .",
    "there has of course been dramatic progress in the one and two dimensional solvable models of coulomb systems , which we do not include in the review , apart from isolated comments included to demonstrate some contrast with three dimensions .",
    "let us also mention that basic new results on the stability of coulombic matter in presence of magnetic fields and quantized radiation field have been obtained recently ( references in [ sec- quantum ] ) .",
    "the history of proofs of fundamental results , for example that statistical mechanics predicts phase transitions , suggests that difficult results can simplify over time and serve as consistency checks on what comes next .",
    "some but not all of the derivations in this review are far from this stage : nevertheless , the existence of the subtle tunneling corrections in the debye asymptotic regime revealed by the sine - gordon representation is not seen by conventional mayer graph summations",
    ". the suggestive view of the quantum gas as an assembly of random multipoles displayed by the feynman - kac representation and the related lack of screening are much easier to miss in the conventional many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the physically very natural molecular limit considered in the main theorem of chapter  [ chapter-7 ] should be introduced and discussed in any text book on quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a list of some questions that seem to us of interest , to be pursued in the spirit of this review and perhaps by similar techniques .",
    "+ classical : debye regime +    a more detailed understanding of boundary conditions and charge expulsion .",
    "+ results on correlations along walls , surface charges .",
    "+ understanding the improved debye - hckel theories of fisher et al . as limiting theories .",
    "+    dipole systems +    more definitive results on the dielectric constant and clarification of the literature in the light of such results .",
    "+    quantum : low density +    prove absence of exponential screening or at least finiteness of each individual mayer - like diagram of chapter  [ chapter - loops ] .",
    "+ correlations in non - uniform systems , e.g. along walls .",
    "+ coherent treatment of para and diamagnetism , boundary currents .",
    "+    slightly imperfect molecular gases +    lowest order corrections to the molecular limit , atomic correlations and van der waals forces .",
    "+ possible existence of dielectric phases with true atomic dipoles .",
    "+    compatibility of macroscopic electrostatics and statistical mechanics of quantum charges .",
    "+      we consider several species , @xmath2 , of charged particles with charges @xmath3 of both signs , confined to a box @xmath4 in @xmath5 .",
    "if there are @xmath1 particles in total sitting in an external electrostatic potential @xmath6 then the potential energy is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 is the two body coulomb potential energy @xmath10 and the ellipsis indicates potentials due to other forces , that are discussed below .",
    "suppose that @xmath11 denotes the number of particles of species @xmath12",
    ". then the equilibrium statistical mechanics is determined by the partition function @xmath13 and @xmath14 is called the activity of species @xmath15 .",
    "in particular the pressure @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 the activities in the partition function are related to the chemical potential @xmath18 of species @xmath12 by the standard formula @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the de broglie length given below in ( [ 1.1.3ccc ] ) .",
    "this formula results from the classical limit of quantum mechanics .    in three dimensions",
    "a purely coulomb boltzmann factor @xmath21 is not integrable because of the coulomb singularities at @xmath22 : additional forces are necessary for stability .",
    "we suppose there is a length scale @xmath23 where the coulomb potential gives way to these other forces .",
    "we used @xmath23 because it suggests a de  broglie length @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass of species @xmath12 .",
    "for example , for individual point particles , classical mechanics gives way to quantum mechanics when their wave functions overlap , which occurs at separation @xmath26 . for ions",
    ", @xmath23 would instead be the radius of an outer orbital . for fermions ,",
    "one attempts to model the pauli principle together with electrostatic repulsion by classical effective short range forces .",
    "we will either represent these short range forces by a hard core of radius @xmath23 or we will smooth the coulombic singularity by replacing @xmath27 by @xmath28 neither choice is likely to be a realistic description of the physics at this length scale , so these are only claimed to be useful when one can show that there are predictions which are not very dependent on how the short range force is chosen .",
    "the notation @xmath29 conveys the equation @xmath30 where we set @xmath31 the potential @xmath29 is the green s function for @xmath32 with the boundary condition appropriate for a system confined to a box @xmath33 with insulating walls .",
    "we shall also consider systems confined in a box with conducting grounded walls . in these cases @xmath34 is replaced by @xmath35 which then denotes the greens function with zero boundary conditions .",
    "consider the case where the ellipsis in ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) represent a hard core of radius @xmath23 . by newton",
    "s theorem each point charge can then be spread out into an equivalent charge on a sphere of radius @xmath23 without changing the coulomb interaction energy .",
    "if self - energies of the spheres are added into the coulomb energy then it is positive because it can be written as the integral of the square of the electric field .",
    "since the self - energy of @xmath1 spheres is @xmath36 this argument shows that @xmath37 thus the introduction of the hard cores has made @xmath38 finite @xcite .    the same stability bound holds in the other case where the additional terms in the ellipsis in ( [ 1.1.1 ] ) smooth out the coulombic singularity .",
    "the total potential energy with self - energies added is @xmath39 which is positive because it equals , in fourier space , @xmath40 the self energies are again @xmath41 so we obtain ( [ 1.1.3b ] ) .",
    "analogous arguments using the appropriate eigenfunctions in place of @xmath42 show that stability bounds hold also for particles in an grounded container .",
    "we use the summation identity @xmath43 to write the partition function ( [ 1.1.3 ] ) in the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 unites the spatial and species coordinate so that @xmath46 and the @xmath47 integration means @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we denote by @xmath50 a configuration of the particles , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "if they are not all distinct ( coincident points ) then our definition includes squares or higher powers of delta functions . at various points in the text",
    "we will use the phrase `` does not include contributions from coincident points '' to indicate that such powers of delta functions are omitted . to illustrate what `` including contributions from coincident points '' means , consider @xmath62 . the integral smooths the delta function in ( [ 1.1.8a ] ) so that the diagonal terms @xmath63 in @xmath64 give the `` coincident contribution '' @xmath65 .",
    "we also introduce the charge density observable @xmath66 and the charge distributions @xmath67 more generally one obtains mixed charge - particle distributions by taking the average of products of density observables and charge observables ( [ 1.1.8a ] ) and ( [ 1.1.8 ] ) .",

    "these results include charge - symmetric classical systems with positive - definite potentials .",
    "they rely on the sine - gordon transformation described later .",
    "the physical content of these results on the existence of the infinite volume limit is that the limit exists independently of the way the container is enlarged .",
    "for example , we could consider two sequences of increasingly large containers related by a fixed translation .",
    "both sequences would have the same infinite volume limit , so the limit must be translation invariant .",
    "in particular the limiting distributions could not describe a crystal with a low density of defects . on the other hand one would expect to be able to select such a state by choosing a sequence of containers whose",
    "boundaries match the natural planes of the crystal , unless the system never forms crystals .",
    "therefore these results are evidence that stable charge symmetric systems with positive - definite potentials are always in a fluid phase .",
    "further results on existence of the infinite volume limit of classical distribution functions at low density are included in the work on debye screening @xcite reviewed in the next chapter , but these are low density results .      * *    in systems with short range interactions the densities of different species can be varied independently , but coulomb systems maintain charge neutrality @xmath133 by expelling excess charge to the boundary @xcite .",
    "we introduce a vector notation @xmath134 for the set of charges and chemical potentials , and decompose @xmath135 @xmath136 into its components perpendicular and parallel to the charge vector .",
    "then , the charge neutrality is equivalent with the fact that the infinite volume limit of grand canonical pressure does not depend on the component @xmath137 of @xmath135 along the charge vector @xmath138 this means that different choices of chemical potentials @xmath139 or activities @xmath14 do not necessarily lead to different densities .",
    "it is common to break this redundancy by imposing @xmath140 the system will be neutral regardless of whether pseudo - neutrality is imposed or not , but in section  [ sec - charge - expulsion ] we will argue that charges that are expelled to the boundary create a constant external electrostatic potential @xmath141 which renormalizes the activities @xmath142 $ ] in such a way as to restore the condition for the renormalized activities . thus imposing the condition amounts to working with the renormalized activities .",
    "this chapter is devoted to screening in classical coulomb systems .",
    "we begin with a review of the original theory of debye and hckel followed by an account of some rigorous theorems . then there",

    "the mean field theory approximation for the dilute plasma phase @xcite is at the center of our discussion .",
    "we will briefly review their argument to prepare the way for further developments .",
    "for further background see @xcite .",

    "the activities in this definition of @xmath146 are required to satisfy the pseudo - neutrality condition ( [ 2.1.1b ] ) .",
    "it is standard to define the debye length in terms of densities by the formula @xmath148 and we have used the notation @xmath146 instead of the standard @xmath149 because the two definitions are not equal , although their ratio tends to one in the debye - hckel limit described below .    the conclusions of debye - hckel theory include that the pressure @xmath16 and charge - charge correlation obey @xmath150 the debye - hckel argument suggests that these are really limiting laws , holding in a limit in which the number of particles in a volume @xmath151 tends to infinity , while the number in a volume @xmath152 tends to zero .",
    "perturbation expansions @xcite are also likely to be asymptotic as opposed to convergent , but it is still natural to believe that the second result holds in a stronger sense : that without taking the limit there can be exponential decay of correlations , particularly if one is reasonably close to the limit",

    "we can obtain the second debye - hckel law from ( [ 1.1.eff ] ) using the fourier transform .",
    "in ( [ 2.1.4 ] ) the @xmath171 is the mean density of a spherically symmetric opposite charge `` screening '' cloud that forms around the positive charge at the origin .",
    "note that within the linear approximation @xmath172 our calculations imply @xmath173 by newton s theorem , such a cloud is equivalent to an additional negative charge at the origin that neutralizes the fixed charge up to a remainder exponentially small in the radius to the point @xmath55 .",
    "of course no single charge configuration of point particles can be spherically symmetric .",
    "the cloud is an ensemble average over configurations .",
    "this cancellation of charge is captured in `` sum rules '' which will be discussed in section  [ sec - debye - screening ] .",
    "related to this point is the fact that the integral over @xmath174 of the right hand side of ( [ 2.1.2 ] ) vanishes .      in this section",
    "we will survey the rigorous results on debye screening and the debye - hckel approximation concentrating on three dimensional systems but with some remarks about other dimensions .",
    "the one dimensional coulomb system without hard core has been solved exactly @xcite .",

    "it is given by the sum @xmath684 the factor @xmath685 is the spin degeneracy , since the hamiltonian ( [ 1.2.1 ] ) is independent of the spin .    a look at the boltzmann - like factor in ( [ 4.9 ] ) suggests naturally the introduction of an enlarged classical phase space whose elements @xmath686 are @xmath687 where @xmath15 is the species and @xmath667 is the filament shape of a particle at position @xmath670 .",
    "we shall call a point @xmath688 in this phase space a `` filament '' .",
    "since the hamiltonian is invariant under the permutations of the particles of the same species , we can use again the summation identity ( [ 1.1.4 ] ) to write the partition function ( [ 4.11 ] ) in the form @xmath689 where the phase space integration means @xmath690 in ( [ 4.14 ] ) we have set @xmath691 @xmath692 with @xmath693 it is clear that the system defined by the relations ( [ 4.14])-([4.18 ] ) has the structure of a classical statistical mechanical system of objects having internal degrees of freedom @xmath694 ( the species and the shape of a filament ) , with activity ( [ 4.16 ] ) and two - body interaction ( [ 4.18 ] ) .",
    "we call it `` the system of filaments '' and can apply to it all the standard methods of classical statistical mechanics .    in particular , one can define correlations between filaments in the usual way ( see ( [ 1.1.8a ] ) and ( [ 1.1.9a ] ) ) . introducing the `` @xmath695-function '' which identifies the points @xmath696 and @xmath697 in phase space , i.e. @xmath698 the density of filaments and the two filament distribution are @xmath699 where @xmath700 and @xmath701 denotes the grand - canonical average in the system of filaments ( the contribution of coincident filaments , included in ( [ 4.20 ] ) ,",
    "will be specified later if needed ) .",
    "however , one should remember that the shapes of the filaments are not directly observable quantities : the physical particle distributions are obtained by integrating them out in ( [ 4.20 ] ) and ( [ 4.21 ] ) . thus the density of particles of type @xmath15 is @xmath702 the two particle distribution is @xmath703 and in the same way for the truncated distributions , @xmath704    at this point , one has to make a fundamental observation .",
    "although the system of filaments can be treated with the rules of classical statistical mechanics , it differs from a genuine assembly of classical charged random wires ( distributed according to the gaussian measure @xmath705 ) on an important point : _ the interaction ( [ 4.18 ] ) inherited from the quantum mechanical nature of the charges is not the standard electrostatic potential between two closed wires of shapes @xmath706 and @xmath707_. the latter potential , denoted @xmath708 , is @xmath709 since every element of charge @xmath710 carried by the first filament has to interact with every element @xmath711 of the other by the coulomb law , and the corresponding total electrostatic energy is @xmath712 _ although the filaments are quantum mechanical in origin , we will use this subscript @xmath713 to denote the filament system with interaction @xmath714_. replacing the interaction ( [ 4.18 ] ) by ( [ 4.25 ] ) would indeed lead to a genuine system of charged filaments obeying exponential debye screening in the appropriate low density or high temperature regime , according to the theorems quoted in chapter  [ chapter- debye - screening ] and the discussion in section  [ sec-4.6 ] .",
    "hence different behaviors between quantum and classical charges in thermal equilibrium must be traced back to the difference between the interactions ( [ 4.18 ] ) and ( [ 4.25 ] ) @xmath715 the large distance behavior of @xmath716 is obtained from the multipolar expansion of the potential @xmath9 written in the form @xmath717 where @xmath718 are the multipolar differential operators @xmath719 in the decomposition ( [ 4.28 ] ) , the three first terms correspond to the charge - charge and charge - multipole interactions , whereas the last term represents the rest of the multipole - multipole interactions . since @xmath720 we see that only this latter term contributes to @xmath721 @xmath722 the dominant large distance behavior of @xmath721 @xmath723 is typically a dipole - dipole potential , decaying as @xmath724 , due to the dipole elements @xmath725 and @xmath726 associated with two filaments of arbitrary shapes .",
    "it will be shown ( chapter  [ chapter - loops ] ) that the charge - charge and charge - multipole interactions have a fast screening in the quantum gas , but not the multipole - multipole interaction .",
    "this long range term will precisely be the cause for the breakdown of exponential screening in the quantum system for all values of the density and of the temperature .",
    "for the sake of pedagogy , we illustrate the above assertions in a simplified model involving only two quantum mechanical charges .",

    "the correction @xmath775 in ( [ 4.43 ] ) arises from the square of the dipole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "note that the result ( [ 4.43 ] ) holds in any screening phase of the classical plasma and is non - perturbative in @xmath643 .    in the classical limit or in the high temperature limit",
    ", one finds that the dominant contribution to @xmath776 is the same @xcite @xmath777    the role of the quantum fluctuations is clearly demonstrated : the dipole - like interaction @xmath721 , which originates from these intrinsic quantum fluctuations , can definitely not be shielded by the classical charges , even if the latter are in the debye phase .",
    "nevertheless a partial screening remains : the monopole is still screened and this , together with rotation invariance , reduces the bare coulomb decay @xmath778 to @xmath644 .",
    "it will be shown in section [ sec-4.5 ] as well in chapters  [ chapter - loops ] and [ chapter-6 ] that these facts remain true in the full quantum gas .",
    "one can interpret the result ( [ 4.43 ] ) by saying that there exists an effective potential @xmath779 between two individual quantum charges defined by @xmath780 .",
    "it is attractive at large distance and behaves as @xmath781 one may wonder if this potential between individual quantum charges is related to the van der waals potential , also decaying as @xmath644 .",
    "the van der waals forces are usually computed for preformed atoms and molecules in empty space , and are attributed to the dipole fluctuations in these bound entities .    to allow for the possibility of quantum mechanical binding in simple terms",
    ", we can generalize the model of section  [ sec-4.3 ] by specifying four particles , say two electron - proton ( e - p ) pairs , in equilibrium with a classical plasma @xcite .",
    "the information about the correlations between these four particles is contained in the fully truncated four point correlation function @xmath782 where @xmath783 designate the coordinates of the electrons and @xmath784 those of the protons .",
    "this correlation is defined by the natural generalization of the expressions ( [ 4.35])-([4.39 ] ) to four particles immersed in the plasma .",
    "we are interested in the amount of correlation that exists between the two ( e - p ) pairs as their centers of mass are taken far apart , but ignoring the relative positions of the particles .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the two protons are infinitely heavy ( i.e. classical ) , the center of mass of the pairs coincide with @xmath785 and the desired normalized correlation is @xmath786the factor @xmath787 takes into account that the electrons , treated here as identical particles , can be found in the neighborhood of either one of the protons ( the contribution of coincident particles is omitted in ( [ 4.44b ] ) ) .",
    "we define the effective ( temperature and density dependent ) potential @xmath788 between the two pairs by @xmath789 in contrast to the standard calculation of van der waals forces , @xmath790 incorporates now the effects of the thermal fluctuations of the electrons and of the screening provided by the medium .    as in ( [ 4.41 ] ) , the asymptotic form of @xmath788 is determined by the quadratic term in the quantum potential @xmath721 , namely @xmath791 where now @xmath792 are dressed brownian measures involving the single ( e - p ) pair correlation .",
    "one finds @xmath793 there are two situations of interest , the high temperature limit ( @xmath794 fixed ) and the atomic limit .",
    "the atomic limit is obtained by simultaneously lowering the temperature ( @xmath795 ) to favor binding and reducing the density at an exponential rate ( @xmath796 ) to get independent atoms . in this limit ( e - p )",
    "pairs form noninteracting hydrogen atoms in their ground states ( the atomic limit will be discussed in chapter  [ chapter-7 ] for the full quantum gas ) .    in the high temperature limit ,",
    "one recovers the result ( [ 4.44 ] ) , i.e. @xmath797 as @xmath798 , the electrons tend to be fully ionized and the correlation becomes that found between individual charges .    in the atomic limit , for @xmath799",
    "not too large , one has @xmath800 where @xmath801 is the usual coefficient found in text books from a second order perturbation calculation of the residual coulomb interaction between two hydrogen atoms in their ground states .",
    "a similar analysis has now been carried out in the full quantum mechanical electron - proton gas with the diagrammatic methods of chapter  [ chapter - loops ] .",
    "one finds indeed that the coefficient of the @xmath644 tail of the proton - proton correlation approaches the value @xmath802 in the scaling limit where hydrogen atoms form @xcite . in the medium ,",
    "density and temperature effects modify the amplitude of the usual van der waals potential , but not its @xmath644 range . in particular , the free charges that are always present in the medium only partially screen the dipole interaction between atoms , contrary to a naive mean field description that would lead to an exponential screening of these interactions . the partial screening of protons is due in part to collective effects , and also to individual electrons that will bind with the proton .",
    "as the temperature goes to zero the former effects vanish , and the screening is eventually entirely due to the formation of a neutral bound state .",
    "hence the atomic limit coincides with a zero density calculation with two preformed neutral atoms in empty space .",
    "in fact , the coefficient @xmath803 interpolates continuously between the high temperature and atomic regimes . there is no qualitative difference between the mechanism producing the van der waals forces between bound entities and that causing the @xmath644 tail ( [ 4.43 ] ) between individual charges .",
    "both have their common origin in the same basic quantum fluctuations put into evidence in the preceding section .",
    "one sees that the difference is only quantitative . in the atomic regime ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath803 has a non - zero value close to @xmath804 whereas it becomes vanishingly small at high temperature .",
    "we come now to the full quantum mechanical gas , but treated semi - classically as a whole .",
    "we use again the classical gas as a reference system by splitting the interaction between the filaments ( [ 4.17 ] ) into @xmath805 where @xmath806 is the coulomb energy of @xmath57 classical point particles and @xmath807 is the residual multipolar interaction . it is defined as the sum of two - body interactions @xmath808 obtained from ( [ 4.18 ] ) by removing the charge - charge potential : @xmath809 since the planck constant occurs only through the de broglie lengths @xmath810 , it is clear that @xmath811 and @xmath807 are power series in @xmath643 starting with a linear term ( see ( [ 4.5 ] ) and ( [ 4.28a ] ) ) .",
    "thus considering @xmath643 as a small parameter , we are left with the standard problem of perturbing the classical equilibrium state ( in the framework of the system of filaments ) by the small modification ( [ 4.48 ] ) of the potential .",
    "this will generate formally power series in @xmath643 for the distributions of filaments , and in turn , after averaging on their shapes , for the truncated distributions of the quantum charges @xmath812 we shall not give here the rather complex algorithm for calculating the coefficients @xmath813 of this expansion , but only describe some qualitative aspects and state results .    from now on we assume that the classical reference system is in the debye phase : its correlations @xmath814 cluster exponentially fast and obey the multipolar sum rule ( [ 2.2.5a ] ) . by expanding around the classical gas , each @xmath813 involves combinations of convolutions of classical correlations with the multipole potentials coming from ( [ 4.47 ] ) , so that the @xmath813 are expressed in terms of the supposedly known correlations @xmath815 of the reference system .",
    "the main point is that , although the classical correlations have an exponential fall - off , the law of formation of the @xmath813 is such that some of these convolutions decay only algebraically ( there are two exceptions , namely if the potential is convoluted with the total charge density , then multipolar sum rules insure a fast decay , or if derivatives of the coulomb potential are contracted to form a laplacian @xmath816 ) .",
    "the results are as follows @xcite .",
    "obviously @xmath817 @xmath818 this is because , according to ( [ 4.28a ] ) , odd powers of @xmath643 in the expansion ( [ 4.49 ] ) correspond to odd moments of filaments .",
    "such odd moments have zero gaussian average .",
    "the coefficients @xmath819 are decreasing faster than any inverse power for large spatial separations of the arguments ( for the two point function see @xcite ) .    at the order",
    "@xmath820 the truncated two particle correlation behaves as @xmath821 @xmath822 in ( [ 4.51a ] ) @xmath823 is the square of the dipole - dipole potential @xmath824 and @xmath825 where @xmath826 means equilibrium average with respect to the classical reference system . since @xmath827 , @xmath828 , the leading contribution to ( [ 4.51a ] ) is @xmath829    if one examines the correlation of a particle with the total charge density @xmath229 , one must replace @xmath830 in one factor @xmath831 by the charge @xmath229 .",
    "then the coefficient of @xmath832 vanishes in ( [ 4.54 ] ) because of the charge sum rule ( [ 2.2.5a ] ) , and one has to carry the asymptotic expansion of @xmath823 further on . for the particle - charge correlation",

    "furthermore , in view of the second moment condition ( [ 1.1.1sti ] ) , the correlations at order @xmath820 in the jellium behaves as @xmath840 for the jellium , @xcite have given the complete formula for @xmath841 at the order @xmath842 including the short range contributions .    correlations involving more than two particles also have slow decays at order @xmath820 .",
    "for instance @xmath843 decays also as @xmath844 when the particle 1 is sent to infinity , the other being kept fixed .",
    "if the three particles are taken simultaneously far apart ( say , @xmath845 ) , this function decays as @xmath846 .",
    "moreover , the four point function @xmath847 decays only as @xmath848 when two pairs of particles are sent far away ( say , @xmath849 fixed , @xmath850 ) .",
    "this slow decay is due to the breaking of rotational invariance around the points @xmath851 and @xmath852 when the directions @xmath853 and @xmath854 are fixed .",
    "it is precisely because of rotation invariance that the pure dipolar decay @xmath848 is reduced to @xmath644 in the two point function , as in the model of section [ sec-4.3 ] .",
    "we have reported on the semi - classical tails ( [ 4.54])-([4.56 ] ) in some details with the purpose of illustrating the following points .",
    "there is definitely no exponential screening in the quantum gas , even in the high temperature phase and what ever the density may be .",
    "moreover , in contrast with a fluid with short range forces , various types of decay laws have to be expected depending on what type of observables are concerned , and what cluster of particles are taken far apart .",
    "the occurrence of these different types of decay are due to the underlying multipolar forces displayed in the filament formalism in conjunction with the effect of screening sum rules ( [ 2.2.5a ] ) .",
    "we finally discuss the possible observable implications of these findings .",
    "since the calculations pertain to the semi - classical regime , we only consider real systems under conditions that the quantum effects are small .",
    "we determine the crossover distance @xmath855 above which quantum algebraic tails dominate the classical behavior by equating ( [ 4.58 ] ) to the usual debye law @xmath856 the classical exponential is normalized in order to obey the charge sum rule .",
    "for instance , for sodium chloride at room temperature , one finds @xmath857 . for a white dwarf under prevailing conditions",
    ", one has @xmath858 . in both cases ,",
    "the quantum effects on the clustering turn out to be very small and the use of the debye potential is still legitimate from a quantitative point of view . however",

    "the massive zero frequency field @xmath927 mediates ( parts of ) the electrostatic potential @xmath750 defined in ( [ 4.25 ] ) whereas the non - zero frequency field @xmath928 mediates ( part of ) the non - electrostatic part @xmath721 defined in ( [ 4.27 ] ) that can not be screened .",
    "all these discussions show that screening is destroyed because lack of commutativity of momentum and position bring time dependent phenomena in through the back door ( e.g. , the imaginary time ordering mentioned below ( [ 4.6.5 ] ) ) .",
    "it is in fact easy to prove that imaginary time dependent observables are not screened @xcite .    we should also mention that another class of semiclassical models has been introduced , to deal with polarizability effects in dielectrics @xcite . in these models ,",

    "the @xmath1037-diagrams can be divided into classes such that all diagrams in a class lead to the same so - called prototype @xmath1067-diagram when all the coulomb points are integrated out .",

    "since coulomb points can not occur in    prototype graphs , the use of these bonds is subjected to the excluded    convolution rule : in a @xmath1067-diagram , convolutions    @xmath1068 are    forbidden .",
    "( ii ) : :    a bound @xmath1069 that incorporates all the bonds that are not    taken into account in ( * i * ) .",

    "the coulomb chains occurring in ( * b.1 * ) and ( * b.2 * ) must have intermediate points since there is at most one f - bond between two points in a @xmath1037-diagram .",
    "the sum of such coulomb chains,@xmath1071 , is obtained by removing from @xmath520 ( [ 5.51 ] ) the single bonds ( [ 5.41])-([5.44 ] ) .",
    "thus , with ( [ 5.28 ] ) @xmath1072 the contributions described in ( * a * ) and ( * b * ) sum up to @xmath1073 the last two parts of ( [ 5.54 ] ) correspond to the contributions ( * b.1 * ) and ( * b.2 * ) ( for the combinatorial aspects , see @xcite . combining the definitions ( [ 5.38 ] ) , ( [ 5.40 ] ) , ( [ 5.51 ] ) and ( [ 5.53 ] ) in ( [ 5.54 ] ) leads to the final result ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) @xmath1074    eventually the loop - ursell function is given by a sum of prototype graphs @xmath1067 @xmath1075_{\\pi } \\label{5.56}\\ ] ] with f - bonds @xmath1076 and @xmath1077 .",
    "the @xmath1067-diagrams have the same structure as the @xmath1025-diagrams , with the additional excluded convolution rule formulated in ( * i * ) .",
    "all f - bonds are rapidly decreasing except @xmath1069 . obviously the asymptotic behavior of @xmath1069 is dominated by that of @xmath930 @xmath1078which is of dipole type as shown by ( [ 5.35 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that each @xmath1069 bond has the same form ( up to short range contributions ) as that found in the model of section  [ sec-4.3 ] when only two quantum mechanical charges are present .",
    "the long range part @xmath721 depends solely on the intrinsic quantum fluctuations of the two particles ( or the two loops ) , and not on the temperature and density of the state .",
    "there are of course several ways of reorganizing the diagrams with bare coulomb bonds ( [ 5.38 ] ) into prototype graphs by partial resummations .",
    "other resummations may be more adequate depending on the density and temperature regime and the physical quantity to be computed .",
    "the present reorganization appears to be optimal in the following sense .",
    "the remaining long range part has been isolated in the single bond @xmath1077 .",
    "the decay can not be improved any more by chain resummations . by ( [ 5.57 ] ) and ( [ 5.35 ] ) ,",
    "the longest range part of such chains would arise from convolutions of @xmath721-bonds , but such convolutions keep their dipolar character @xcite ; the same is true for classical dipoles , see for instance @xcite .",
    "moreover , our prototype diagrams are the natural generalization of those used in the classical case .",
    "indeed , if we set the de broglie lengths equal to zero , the multipolar operator ( [ 5.27 ] ) vanishes as well as @xmath721 , @xmath1079 and @xmath1080 .",
    "the effects of the quantum statistics disappear , and both @xmath1081 ( [ 5.46 ] ) and @xmath1082 ( [ 5.52 ] ) reduce to the usual debye potential @xmath1083 .",
    "hence one finds that the only surviving bonds are @xmath1084 and from ( [ 5.55 ] ) @xmath1085 they are precisely the two bonds occurring in the meeron theory of the classical plasma @xcite .",
    "let us present some crude arguments for the integrability of @xmath1067-diagrams ; they can be substantiated by the more thorough analysis of @xcite , but a proof is still missing .",
    "each internal point involves a density factor @xmath1086 which depends only on the internal variables of the loop and not on its location in space because of translation invariance .",
    "integration on an internal point @xmath941 will be of the form @xmath1087where @xmath1088 denotes the @xmath941-dependence of the bonds attached to this point .",
    "it can be argued that the loop - density @xmath972 is bounded in the shape variables @xmath1089 and inherits a prefactor @xmath1090 from the activity of the loop ( see ( [ 5.13 ] ) , ( [ 5.15 ] ) and ( [ 5.60 ] ) below ) .",
    "thus for a sufficiently negative chemical potential this factor should insure convergence for the @xmath937 summation on the size of the loops .",
    "if these conditions are met , the integrability of @xmath1067-diagrams , when the distance between the loops becomes large , is determined by the the decay of the f - bonds . because of the absence of articulation points , any cluster of points is linked by at least two bonds to the remaining points of the diagram .",
    "hence the product @xmath1091_{\\pi}$ ] , once integrated on the internal variables , decays at least as @xmath1092 in the loop distances , showing the integrability for the whole diagram .",
    "one should add that the splitting ( [ 5.39 ] ) of the original f - bond may introduce spurious non - integrable singularities at the origin in some diagrams .",
    "these singularities will cancel out when suitably collecting together such dangerous diagrams ( the f - bond ( [ 5.38 ] ) gives a finite contribution at the origin because of the smoothening provided by the functional integration on the filaments ) .",
    "to summarize the situation , once the topological reduction to prototype diagrams has been performed , the two - particle correlation is reduced , in the sense of the formal diagrammatic cluster expansion ( [ 5.56 ] ) , to a system that resembles a classical gas of multipoles described in the loop formalism by the four types of bonds @xmath1093 and @xmath1077 .",
    "an important remark has to be made when one comes down to computations , in particular when one seeks to obtain explicit low density expansions of physical quantities .",
    "the diagrammatic representation ( [ 5.56 ] ) of the loop ursell function is a straightforward expansion in the density of loops , but not in the particle densities @xmath1094 themselves , for two reasons :    * the resummed f - bonds depend on the particle densities through the density dependent screened potential @xmath1081 ( [ 5.46 ] ) , * the loop densities entering as weights of the internal points in @xmath1067-diagrams are not simply proportional to the particle densities .",
    "the first point is not new and occurs of course already in the diagrammatic treatment of the classical gas .",
    "the second point is more delicate : the loop and particle densities are related by the formula ( [ 5.21 ] ) ; hence the particle - particle distributions ( [ 5.22 ] ) calculated from ( [ 5.56 ] ) have a very implicit dependence on the @xmath1094 . in principle",
    "this dependence can be extracted as follows . according to the standard rules of the mayer diagrammatics ,",
    "the loop density is represented by the activity expansion @xmath1095_g \\label{5.60}\\ ] ] the @xmath831-diagrams are defined as the @xmath1025-diagrams ( with one root point ) except that articulation points are allowed and weights are given by activities .",
    "the integrals diverge in ( [ 5.60 ] ) because of the long range of the @xmath169-bonds , but after a suitable topological reduction ( resumming coulomb chains ) , the representation of @xmath972 becomes a series of prototype graphs , each of them being finite .",
    "the procedure is similar to that given above for the ursell function and will not be described here in detail , see @xcite . once this is done , formula ( [ 5.21 ] ) yields in principle the particle densities as functions of the activities @xmath1096 because of the overall neutrality @xmath1097 the system ( [ 5.61 ] ) consists only of @xmath1098 independent relations , and so does not determine the @xmath1099 uniquely . a unique determination of the @xmath1100 is usually made by imposing the convenient additional relation ( already discussed in section  [ sec- neutrality ] ) @xmath1101 thus by inverting the system ( [ 5.61])-([5.62 ] ) one can express first @xmath972 and then the particle - particle correlations in terms of the @xmath1094 .",
    "explicit calculations in this formalism can of course only be performed in the low density regime .",
    "applications to the determination of the asymptotic behavior of the correlations and to the virial equation of state will be presented in the next chapter .",
    "[ chapter-6 ]      the first application of the general formalism concerns the determination of the large distance behavior of the correlations without recourse to @xmath643- expansions , including the quantum statistics and using the exact coulomb potential on all scales .",
    "the calculation remains perturbative in the sense that we examine the large distance behavior of each @xmath1067-diagram in the series ( [ 5.56 ] ) representing the ursell function , but , as before , without control on the sum of these series .",
    "the semi - classical analysis of section  [ sec-4.3 ] has revealed that the two particle correlation , at order @xmath842 , decay as @xmath644 at large distance . we show that the same result holds for each of the @xmath1067-diagrams contributing to the particle- particle correlation @xmath1102 , i.e. @xmath1103 where the coefficient @xmath1104 is the formal sum of the asymptotic contributions of the @xmath1067-diagrams as @xmath1105 at densities @xmath1106 and inverse temperature @xmath735 .",
    "it is then possible to calculate the lowest order contributions in the densities @xmath1106 to @xmath1104 leading to the explicit formula ( [ 6.23 ] ) below .",
    "we will describe the general strategy and illustrate some key points by explicit calculations , details can be found in @xcite .",
    "a short review can be found in @xcite .",
    "the first task is to study the behavior of the ursell function ( [ 5.56 ] ) in the space of loops as the loops are separated .",
    "this large distance behavior will be determined by that of the four bonds @xmath1107 and @xmath1077 , once integration on the internal loop variables has been performed in prototype graphs . among these bonds , only @xmath1077 has the long range multipolar character ( [ 5.57 ] ) that may induce a slow decay of the graph as the two loops are separated .",
    "therefore one has to keep track of the effects of @xmath1077-bonds ( and more specifically of the basic quantum interaction @xmath721 ( [ 5.33 ] ) ) in the convolutions occurring in prototype diagrams . for this",
    "it is appropriate to recall some facts on the asymptotic form of convolutions in three dimensional space .",
    "the forthcoming analysis depends on the assumption ( made throughout the whole section [ sec-6.1 ] ) that the leading asymptotic term has a monotone decay , whose behavior is governed by that of the small wave numbers @xmath1108 of the fourier transform .",
    "possible decay with oscillation , due to singularities at non - zero values of @xmath1109 , is not considered .",

    "although the determination of the kind of complexes occurring for a given value of @xmath1469 remains unsolved , it is pleasing to see how the thermodynamics of ideal substances emerges in principle from the basic statistical mechanics of electrons and nuclei in the molecular limit .",

    "the idea is now to decompose the total domain @xmath1539 into subdomains @xmath1540 of diameter @xmath672 and to let @xmath672 grow with @xmath735 in a suitable way .",
    "one has to solve the two following problems .",
    "problem 1 : :    determine the size of @xmath1540 such that the partition    function @xmath1541 of a    single subdomain is that of a system having at most complexes of the    type @xmath1542 , in @xmath1540 .",

    "thus in the sequel we keep in mind that @xmath1548      we envisage now problem 1 , following mainly @xcite .",
    "we write the grand - canonical partition function for a finite region @xmath1549 of volume @xmath1550 as a sum on all particle numbers @xmath1551where we have singled out the contribution of the @xmath246 complexes that correspond to the chosen value of @xmath1469 and @xmath1552 in ( [ 7.40 ] ) , @xmath1553 means that the trace is taken on states having the dirichlet conditions appropriate to the finite volume hamiltonians @xmath1554 as well as the appropriate particle statistics . for @xmath672 large enough",

    "part of the spectrum of @xmath1569 becomes continuous , corresponding to the scattering states of all the sub - complexes belonging to @xmath1569 .",
    "the basic idea is to ensure the convergence of the traces by the pure kinetic energy : one will dispense with the full hamiltonian with the help of ( [ 7.27 ] ) and the ensuing gap property .",

    "see the discussion below ( [ 2.7.ising ] ) and note that our constraint forces the cross terms to vanish . under the same conditions we also have @xmath2011",

    "the constraint forces @xmath397 to hold contours when it is not a single cube and contours are responsible for the @xmath2015 in ( [ a.k1 ] ) .",
    "this definition leads to the desired representation @xmath2016    it is convenient to measure distance using @xmath2017 so that the unit cube centered on the origin is @xmath2018 .",
    "@xmath2019 is defined to be the open set consisting of all points closer than @xmath1972 to some contour in @xmath293 . to derive ( [ a.6 ] ) note that any @xmath293 occurring in the sum ( [ a.1 ] ) determines @xmath2019 which decomposes uniquely into disjoint open connected subsets @xmath1852 .",
    "each @xmath1852 determines a unique @xmath473 such that @xmath2020 the first two conditions determine @xmath473 and the last is implied by them .",
    "therefore the sum over @xmath293 in ( [ a.1 ] ) is equivalent to summing over @xmath1 , @xmath1903 followed by @xmath2021 . by ( [ a.local3 ] ) and the symmetry @xmath2022",
    "we can factor the summands .",
    "this symmetry is the one we remarked in ( [ 2.7.1 ] ) and it holds in this form because for @xmath2023 @xmath2024 is constant on @xmath2025 .",

    "the rest of the tree falls into connected subtrees .",
    "each cluster consists of the vertices in each subtree .",
    "the bonds @xmath2031 we erased are in fact eliminated by the @xmath2033 in the above equation .",
    "the key point is that if @xmath2034 is another bond not in @xmath1739 with @xmath768 and @xmath769 is separate clusters that used to be connected by @xmath1688 then it too is eliminated by @xmath2033 because @xmath2035 implies @xmath2036 .",

    "we assume @xmath2046 and make the inductive hypothesis that the theorem holds for all cases with less than @xmath1 vertices .",

    "the @xmath282 derivative of the right hand side is @xmath2047 we interchange the sums and obtain @xmath2048 where @xmath2049    now we fix @xmath1491 . to use the inductive hypothesis",

    "the possible bonds @xmath2052 are viewed as sets of identified bonds on @xmath1732 .",
    "for example , if @xmath2053 , then @xmath2054 and @xmath2055 become the same bond which we would denote by @xmath2056 or @xmath2057 .",
