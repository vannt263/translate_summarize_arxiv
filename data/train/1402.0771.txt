    "a pivotal property of the low @xmath0 semi - inclusive dis on proton and nuclear targets is geometric scaling of the total @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross sections @xcite , which means scaling with a dimensionless ratio @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is photon virtuality , @xmath0 is bjorken variable and @xmath5 is the saturation momentum . geometric scaling ",
    "a fundamental property of high energy qcd @xcite  is a most clear manifestation of a highly coherent color field , which has a typical transverse momentum scale @xmath6 . in @xcite",
    "it was derived from the low @xmath0 evolution equation of qcd @xcite .",
    "the coherent color field is made up mostly of gluons , which can not directly couple to the virtual photon .",
    "therefore , the leading dis channel at low @xmath0 is a fluctuation of the virtual photon into a @xmath7 pair , which is a color and electric dipole , that subsequently interacts with the color field of the target .",
    "predictions of the perturbation theory are most robust for dis off a heavy nucleus @xmath8 because @xmath9 serves as a convenient resumation parameter .",
    "additionally , the color field strength is boosted by a large factor @xmath10 .",
    "thus , dis off a heavy nucleus is considered to be the best tool to probe the low @xmath0 nuclear structure and dynamics . experimental facilities capable of performing such experiments , for example the electron ion collider ,",
    "are being actively developed .",
    "a large-@xmath11 nucleus also carries strong electric charge @xmath12 .",
    "elastic scattering amplitude of the @xmath7 dipole off the nuclear coulomb field is proportional @xmath13 , which is of order one for a heavy nucleus .",
    "therefore , the cross section for dis off a heavy nucleus also receives a substantial contribution from electromagnetic interactions of the @xmath7 dipole with the nucleus , which is known as the coulomb correction .",
    "since the typical scale of the nuclear electromagnetic field is obviously different from the saturation momentum , the coulomb correction violates the geometric scaling .",
    "we will argue that this correction is large at low @xmath0 and small @xmath1 , which is precisely the region that will be probed by the eic and similar experiments .",
    "the main goal of this letter is to demonstrate the importance of the coulomb correction in dis off heavy nuclei and to investigate it as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath11 .",
    "non - negligible coulomb corrections at medium @xmath0 were recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "at low @xmath0 the total @xmath3 cross section can be expressed in terms of the total dipole ",

    "the relationship between the cross section @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 structure functions is non - trivial due to large coulomb corrections to the leptonic tensor @xcite .    in order to calculate the coulomb correction to the total @xmath3 cross section",
    "we employ the glauber - mueller model @xcite which takes into account multiple scatterings of the @xmath7 dipole in the nucleus .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be qcd and qed contributions to the dipole ",
    "nucleon elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "average over the nucleus wave function can be calculated using the thickness function @xmath24 as follows _ ( b ) & = d^2b_a t_a(b_a ) _ ( b - b_a),[a15 ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 impact parameters of the dipole and a nucleon correspondingly . according to the optical theorem , the dipole  nucleus cross",

    "integrals in ( [ a15 ] ) and ( [ a19 ] ) can be analytically calculated in a simple but quite accurate  cylindrical nucleus \" model ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which approximates the nuclear thickness function by the step function , viz .",
    "@xmath29 if @xmath30 and zero otherwise .",

    "the largest size of the @xmath7 dipole , corresponding to the smallest @xmath39 , is @xmath40 due to the confinement .",
    "for that reason @xmath37 , and hence ( [ a23 ] ) , depends on the constituent quark mass @xmath15 rather than on the much smaller current quark mass @xmath41 .",
    "( [ a21])([a23 ] ) are derived in the quasi - classical approximation where the quark saturation momentum @xmath35 , and hence the qcd contribution to the total cross section , is @xmath0-independent . at lower @xmath0 ,",
    "such that @xmath42 , the qcd quantum evolution effects become important and are described by the bk equation @xcite .",
    "it emerges form the solution to the bk equation that the saturation momentum acquires @xmath0-dependence in the form @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a certain positive number @xcite .",
    "the functional form of the dipole cross section is also evolving with @xmath0 ; ( [ a22 ] ) in that case is the initial condition .",
    "several phenomenological models were suggested to describe the evolved dipole cross section .",
    "we will follow the gbw model @xcite which retains the functional form of ( [ a22 ] ) while models the saturation momentum according to ( [ e11 ] ) .",
    "if we neglect the electromagnetic term ( [ a23 ] ) and use ( [ a22 ] ) in ( [ a11 ] ) , then we immediately observe that the total @xmath3 cross section exhibits the geometric scaling .",
    "this is because @xmath0-dependence arises only through the combination @xmath45 , and the dipole size @xmath17 is determined by @xmath46 ( for @xmath47 ) .",
    "that the coulomb correction violates the geometric scaling is evident from ( [ a23 ] ) which , being an electromagnetic contribution , does not depend on the strength of the color field determined by @xmath35 .",
    "unlike the qcd term ( [ a22 ] ) , the qed one ( [ a23 ] ) does not evolve much with @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , @xmath48 , where the intercept @xmath49 incorporates the evolution effect . in the leading - log oder in qcd",
    "@xmath50 @xcite , while in qed @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "because @xmath52 we can neglect the effect of the qed evolution .    substituting ( [ a23 ] ) into ( [ a11 ] ) and integrating over @xmath17 we obtain the following analytic expression for the coulomb correction to the total @xmath3 cross section [ b11 ] _ , t / l&= ( z)^2 _ f g_t / l ( ) , where @xmath53 and [ b13 ] g_t()&=^-1 , + g_l()&=4 + & ^-1.[b15 ] obviously , ( [ b11 ] ) with ( [ b13]),([b15 ] ) does not scale with @xmath54 .",
    "the qcd contribution can be estimated analytically only at very large and very small photon virtuality ( as compared to the saturation momentum ) .",
    "we derive the following asymptotic expressions for the relative size of electromagnetic contribution compared the total @xmath3 cross section : [ c17 ] & = ( z)^2 , when @xmath55 .",
    "this ratio increases logarithmically with @xmath1 , but decreases at low @xmath0 as @xmath56 ( modulo logarithms ) .",
    "we therefore expect that in this kinematic region electromagnetic interactions of the @xmath7 are small at very low @xmath0 .",
    "the situation is remarkably different at semi - hard momenta where the ratio of qed and qcd contribution reads [ c21 ] & = ( z)^2 , when @xmath57 .",
    "we see that since @xmath58 , the relative size of the electromagnetic contribution slowly increases as @xmath59",
    ". nuclear dependence of ( [ c17 ] ) is given by @xmath60 ( modulo logarithms ) , while that of ( [ c21 ] ) by @xmath61 , which indicates that in the saturation region ( [ c21 ] ) the relative electromagnetic contribution is enhanced by @xmath10 as compared to the hard perturbative region ( [ c17 ] ) .",
    "the number of nucleons @xmath11 increases with the number of protons @xmath62 in a nucleus as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a slowly increasing function of @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the above ratios are monotonically increasing functions of @xmath62 , indicating the enhancement of the coulomb correction for heavy nuclei .",

    "total diffractive cross section corresponds to elastic scattering of color dipole on the nucleus .",
    "it can be written as [ d11 ] ^_t / l(x , q^2)= _ 0 ^ 1 dz d^2r _ t / l(r , z)^(x , r ) , where the total elastic dipole  nucleus cross section reads [ d13 ] & ^(x , r)=d^2b | 1- |^2 following the same steps that led from ( [ a20 ] ) to ( [ a21])([a23 ] ) ( details can be found in @xcite ) , we derive [ d25 ] ^(x , r ) = _ ^(x , r)+ _ ( x , r ) , where @xmath69 is the qed contribution given by ( [ a23 ] ) , while the qcd contribution is [ d27 ] _ ^(x , r)=r_a^2 \\ { 1-}^2 .    similarly to the total cross section we find the following asymptotic relations between the qcd contributions to the total and diffractive cross sections .",

    "thus , the relative importance of the coulomb correction in the total cross section is larger than in the diffractive one .",
    "indeed , the qcd contribution to the diffractive cross section is obviously smaller that the total one ( being part of it ) , while the qed contribution is the same .",
    "to obtain a quantitative estimate of the coulomb correction we perform a numerical calculation using ( [ a11])([a23 ] ) and ( [ d11])([d27 ] ) .",
    "the saturation momentum is parameterized according to the golec - biernat  wusthoff model @xcite in which [ e11 ] q_s^2= q_0 ^ 2()^ , where @xmath70  gev , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and effective proton radius @xmath73  gev@xmath74 are parameters fitted to the low @xmath0 dis data .",
    "nuclear radius is given by @xmath75 .",
    "we sum over three light quark flavors with constituent masses @xmath76  mev . since @xmath77 the cross sections are functions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "all qualitative features agree with our analysis in the previous sections .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that at low @xmath1 the qed correction for uranium nucleus at @xmath65 can be as large as 20% in the total cross section and over 40% in the diffractive one .",
    "it is remarkable that the coulomb correction is non - negligible even at high @xmath1 . in diffractive cross section , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , its relative size even increases with @xmath1 , which can be traced back to the extra @xmath78 in ( [ d31 ] ) , see ( [ c17 ] ) .",
    "one should , however , take the results of our calculation at high @xmath1 with a grain of salt as the model we are using does not properly account for the dglap evolution .",
    "a more accurate estimate at high @xmath1 can be obtained with the model of ref .  @xcite . as expected",

    "results presented in this work indicate that coulomb corrections play an important role in the low @xmath0 dis off heavy nuclei in a very wide range of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "more refined estimates should use realistic nuclear profiles and sophisticated low @xmath0 evolution models .",
    "however , they will not change our main conclusion that in order to reliably extract information about the cold nuclear matter structure form the proposed electron - ion collision experiments , one should have the coulomb correction under control .",
