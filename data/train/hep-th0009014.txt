    "the construction of cantorian - fractal space - time @xcite , @xmath5 , contains an infinite number of sets @xmath6 , where the index @xmath7 ranges from @xmath8 .",
    "such index labels the topological dimension of the smooth space into which the fractal set is packed densely .",
    "for example , the sand on the beach looks two - dimensional on the surface .",
    "this is due to a coarse - grain averaging / smoothing of the underlying @xmath9-grains which comprise it . in a similar vein the hausdorff dimensions of the fractal sets packed densely inside the smooth manifold of * integer",

    "the simplest analog of this is dirac s theory of holes to explain the negative energy solutions to his equations ( positrons / antimatter ) .",

    "the spectrum of ( minus ) laplace - beltrami operator on such hyperbolic surfaces is linked to the zeroes of the selberg zeta function .    knowing the energy eigenstates of the schrdinger equation allows to locate the location of the nontrivial zeroes of the selberg zeta function .",

    "the old idea of polya - hilbert , is for example , the search for an equation of the type schrdinger equation on a hyperbolic space ( constant negative curvature ) : @xmath37    the zeroes of the zeta function are then linked to the energy eigenvalues @xmath38 in such a way that @xmath39 and therefore the zeroes of zeta must lie in the critical line : @xmath40 and the riemann conjecture could be proven , at least heuristically .",
    "quantum groups emerged as a result of inverse scattering methods .",
    "the search is to find now whether such operators can be constructed .",
    "if they can , then their spectrum will pick up the imaginary part of the zeroes of the zeta .",

    "if this fractal / discrete derivative operator satisfies the properties above , and the operator is trace - class , then the riemann conjecture could be proven following the arguments of polya and hilbert .    in general the riemann - roch theorem corresponding to a riemann surface of genus @xmath43 is associated with a family of derivative operators @xmath44 .",
    "the former is the derivative operator of `` conformal '' @xmath45 weight @xmath46 acting on the family of tensors @xmath47 with @xmath48 holomorphic indices and @xmath4 antiholomorphic indices such that @xmath49 .",

    "the riemann - roch theorem becomes then for @xmath56 @xmath57 = { 1\\over2 } euler~number = { 1\\over2 } ( 2 - 2 g ) = 1 - g,\\ ] ] the reason is that the complex dimension is 1/2 the real dimension , so the alternating sum of betti numbers multiplied by an over all factor of 1/2 will select the complex dimension in compliance with the hirzebruch - riemann - roch index theorem .",
    "the index in this case depends on the genus of the surface : @xmath58 corresponds to a sphere , @xmath59 to a torus and so forth . for details",
    "we refer to nakahara s book @xcite .",

    "has three terms , and only three terms , in the sums only : euler number of a two dimensional riemann surface @xmath60 .",
    "we will show that the index corresponding to the fractal / discrete derivative operator on the fractal world sheet @xmath61 , whose fractal dimension is @xmath62 , is given by the value of the zeta function evaluated on the spectral dimension of the infinite - cycle intersection @xmath63 which equals @xmath64 .",
    "spinors on riemann surfaces are defined in terms of the square roots of the @xmath65 line bundles : the weight @xmath66 corresponds to positive chirality spinors and the weight @xmath67 corresponds to negative chirality ones .    in cantorian fractal space - time",
    "we may follow by analogy similar arguments if one takes into account that the intrinsic fractal dimension of a bosonic random walk is @xmath68 .",
    "this means that dimensions are counted in basic units of the latter dimension .",
    "in particular , the intrinsic dimension of a fermionic random walk is @xmath66 the bosonic one : @xmath69 .",
    "the analog of the higher genus riemann surfaces corresponds to spaces of negative dimensions . in cantorian - fractal space - time , the totally void set , @xmath70 , is the one whose fractal dimension is equal to zero and is embedded in a space of @xmath71 topological dimension .",
    "the index associated with the analog of the @xmath56 derivative operator @xmath54 in ordinary riemann surfaces of genus @xmath43 , in cantorian - fractal space - time is no longer an integer ! , and is defined in basic units of @xmath68 .",
