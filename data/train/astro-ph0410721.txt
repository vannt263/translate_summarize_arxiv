    "groups and clusters of galaxies are the most massive dynamically relaxed objects in the universe ; as such , they have long been the subject of intense and fruitful study .",
    "more than seventy years ago observations of the coma cluster gave the first evidence for the existence of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "more recently , studies of gravitational lensing by clusters have yielded intriguing new information about the profiles of dark matter halos  @xcite .",
    "identifying and studying galaxies in groups and clusters is essential to understanding the effects of local environment on galaxy formation and evolution ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray measurements of the gas mass fraction in clusters have been used to constrain the mass density parameter @xmath8 and more recently the equation of state of the dark energy , @xmath9  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . finally , if we can accurately measure the abundance of groups _ and its evolution with redshift _ , we can constrain the growth of large - scale structure , thereby placing significant further constraints on cosmological parameters @xcite .    a wide array of methods",
    "has been used to identify groups and clusters at moderate redshifts : x - ray emission from hot intracluster gas  ( reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cosmic shear due to weak gravitational lensing  ( reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , searches in optical photometric data  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect in the cosmic microwave background  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and direct reconstruction of three - dimensional objects in galaxy redshift surveys  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to study the evolution of the group abundance it is necessary to extend observations to more distant objects",
    ". however , most of the methods used for local studies have only limited effectiveness at high redshift .",
    "the apparent surface brightness of x - ray clusters dims as @xmath10 , making only the richest clusters visible at high redshift .",
    "the cross - section for gravitational lensing falls rapidly at high redshifts , making weak - lensing detection of distant clusters difficult for all but the most massive objects . in photometric surveys ,",
    "the increased depth necessary for high - redshift studies increases the overall number density of objects , thereby increasing the problems of foreground and background contamination and projection effects ( though photometric techniques for estimating redshifts can mitigate these difficulties ) .",
    "the sz effect is very promising , since it is entirely independent of redshift , but it also suffers from confusion limits and projection effects , and in any case a large survey of sz clusters is yet to be undertaken .",
    "for the time being , then , one of the few methods that can be applied to large numbers of groups and clusters on similar mass scales at @xmath11 and @xmath7 is the direct detection of these structures in the redshift - space distribution of galaxies .    the first sizeable sample of groups detected in redshift space was presented by  @xcite , who found 176 groups of three or more galaxies in the cfa galaxy redshift survey at redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "recently , @xcite identified groups within the final data release of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) .",
    "their catalog extends to @xmath13 and constitutes the largest currently available catalog of galaxy groups , containing @xmath14 groups with two or more members .",
    "a comprehensive listing of previous studies of local optically selected group samples is also given by these authors .",
    "work is currently underway to detect groups of galaxies in the spectroscopic data of the sloan digital sky survey  @xcite .",
    "studies of groups detected in redshift space were extended to intermediate redshifts by  @xcite , who found more than 200 groups in the cnoc2 redshift survey , with redshifts in the range @xmath15 .",
    "additionally , @xcite studied a sample of 23 density peaks in redshift space , over the redshift range @xmath16 . until now , however , no spectroscopic sample has existed with sufficient size , sampling density and redshift accuracy to extend redshift - space studies of large numbers of groups to redshifts @xmath17 .",
    "the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite is the first large spectroscopic galaxy catalog at high redshift , with observations planned for @xmath18 galaxies , most of which will fall in the range @xmath19 .",
    "the survey is thus a unique dataset for studying high - redshift galaxy groups .",
    "with such a broad range in redshift , we expect to observe evolution in the properties of galaxies , groups , and clusters within the deep2 sample itself ; also , by comparing to local samples from 2dfgrs and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , we expect to observe evolution between @xmath7 and the present epoch .",
    "deep2 is especially well - suited to studies of groups , since its high redshift accuracy allows detailed studies of their internal kinematics .",
    "repeated observations of some deep2 galaxies indicate a velocity accuracy @xmath20 , considerably better than the 2dfgrs value @xmath21  @xcite and similar to the @xmath22 attained in the sdss  @xcite . in particular , it will be possible to estimate the masses of deep2 groups from their velocity dispersions .",
    "we anticipate that , by measuring the evolution of the group velocity function with redshift , it will be possible to constrain cosmological parameters such as the dark energy density parameter @xmath23 and equation of state parameter @xmath9 , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "before carrying out such studies , however , it will be essential to develop robust methods for detecting groups and clusters within deep2 .",
    "identifying groups and clusters in redshift space is well known to be a difficult task .",
    "most notably , clustering information is smeared out by redshift space distortions like the so - called fingers - of - god effect , in which galaxies in groups and clusters appear highly elongated along the line of sight because of intracluster peculiar motions",
    ". this intermingles group members with other nearby galaxies and causes neighboring groups to overlap in redshift space .",
    "a group - finding algorithm that attempts to find all group members will thus necessarily be contaminated by interloper field galaxies and will necessarily merge some distinct groups together into spurious larger structures .",
    "conversely , a group finder that aims to minimize contamination and over - merging will fragment some larger clusters into smaller groups .",
    "this trade - off in group - finding errors is well known ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and fundamentally unavoidable",
    ". it will therefore be essential , before we begin any program of group finding , to construct a suitable definition of group - finding success , identifying in advance which errors we seek to minimize and what sort of errors we are willing to tolerate . ultimately , the chosen definition of success will depend on the intended scientific purpose of the group catalog .",
    "a major portion of this paper will be devoted to defining appropriate measures of group - finding success for the deep2 survey and optimizing our methods using these criteria .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : deep2 ] we introduce the deep2 sample and discuss the unique opportunities and difficulties it presents for group finding . in the same section",
    "we describe the deep2 mock galaxy catalogs , which we will use to calibrate our group - finding methods .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : optimal ] , we describe our criteria for group - finding success . in section  [ sec : gfchoice ] , we give an overview of various group - finding methods that have been used in the literature , and we describe the voronoi - delaunay method ( vdm ) of  @xcite , which we will use in this study . we then proceed to optimize this method for the deep2 sample . finally , in section  [ sec : catalog ]",
    ", we apply the vdm algorithm to the current deep2 observations and present the first deep2 group catalog .",
    "as mentioned , the deep2 galaxy redshift survey is the first large ( tens of thousands of galaxies ) spectroscopic survey of galaxies at high redshifts , @xmath7 .",
    "the goal of the survey is to obtain spectra of @xmath24 objects over @xmath25 on the sky to a limiting magnitude of @xmath26 using the deimos spectrograph on the keck ii telescope .",
    "typical redshifts in the survey fall in the range @xmath27 .",
    "details of the survey will be described comprehensively in an upcoming paper by @xcite ; we summarize the salient information for this study here .",
    "the survey consists of four fields on the sky , chosen to lie in zones of low galactic dust extinction .",
    "three - band ( @xmath28 ) photometry has been obtained for each of these fields using the cfh12k camera on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , as described by  @xcite . in three of the fields , which each consist of three contiguous cfht pointings covering a strip of 120 arcmin by 30 arcmin",
    ", galaxies are selected for spectroscopy if they pass a simple cut in color - color space .",
    "this cut reduces the fraction of galaxies at redshifts @xmath29 to below @xmath30 , while eliminating only @xmath31 of higher - redshift galaxies @xcite . a fourth field , the extended groth survey strip , covers @xmath32 arcmin @xmath33 arcmin , and because of a wide variety of complementary observations underway there",
    ", galaxies in this field are targeted for spectroscopy regardless of color . for the sake of uniformity we neglect the groth field in the current study , though it will be quite useful in future work . within each cfht pointing",
    ", galaxies are selected for spectroscopic observation if they can be placed on one of the @xmath34 deimos slitmasks covering that pointing . within each pointing , slitmasks are tiled in an overlapping pattern , using an adaptive tiling scheme to increase the sampling rate in regions of high density on the sky , so that the vast majority of galaxies have two opportunities to be selected for spectroscopy .",
    "further details of the observing scheme can be found in @xcite .",
    "overall , roughly @xmath35 of galaxies that meet our selection criteria are targeted for deimos observation .",
    "spectroscopic data from deimos are reduced using an automated data - reduction pipeline @xcite , and redshift identifications are confirmed visually . in this paper , we focus on galaxies in the three cfht pointings in which all spectroscopy has been completed as of this writing . the locations of these pointings are given in table  [ tab : fields ] .",
    "each pointing has a width of 48 arcmin in right ascension and 28 arcmin in declination .",
    "these fields have each been fully covered , or very nearly so , by deimos spectroscopy , with a redshift success rate greater than @xmath35 for each slitmask and an overall redshift success rate of @xmath36 .",
    "these three fields , taken together , comprise a sample of 8785 galaxies with confirmed redshifts ( 8370 with @xmath27 ) , with a median redshift of @xmath37 .",
    "this sample represents the largest sample ever used for group - finding in redshift surveys of distant ( @xmath38 ) galaxies , being more than twice as large as the cnoc2 sample of @xcite , and the first such sample at @xmath7 .",
    "ccccc 22 & 16 51 30 & + 34 55 02 & 0.72 + 32 & 23 33 03 & + 00 08 00 & 0.71 + 42 & 02 30 00 & + 00 35 00 & 0.70      both to assess the impact of selection effects and to test and calibrate our group - finding , it will be necessary to study the properties of groups in realistic mock galaxy catalogs .",
    "for this purpose we will use the mock catalogs developed by  @xcite .",
    "these catalogs are produced by assigning `` galaxies '' to n - body simulations according to the prescriptions of the popular `` halo model '' for large - scale structure formation ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this model assumes that all galaxies form within virialized dark matter halos .",
    "the mean number of galaxies above some luminosity @xmath39 in a halo of mass @xmath40 is then given by the halo occupation distribution @xmath41 @xcite , while the luminosities of galaxies in the halo obey a conditional luminosity function , @xmath42 @xcite , which is allowed to evolve with redshift in keeping with observations .",
    "these functions can be varied to produce mock galaxy catalogs that match the observed deep2 redshift distribution and clustering statistics , as measured by  @xcite . in the deep2 mock catalogs used here ,",
    "the `` galaxies '' populating a given host halo are assigned positions and velocities as follows : the brightest galaxy in a halo is placed at the halo s center of mass , and all other galaxies are assigned to random dark matter particles within the halo .    for the purposes of this work , we will use the most recent version of the mock catalogs produced using simulation 4 from table 1 of  @xcite ; for further details about the creation of the deep2 mock galaxy catalogs , the reader is referred to that paper . here",
    "we merely note in summary that the catalogs comprise twelve nearly independent mock deep2 fields with the same geometry as the three high - redshift deep2 fields , extending over a redshift range @xmath43 .",
    "they have been constructed by populating n - body simulations computed in a flat @xmath44cdm cosmology with density parameter @xmath8=0.3 , fluctuation amplitude @xmath45=0.9 , spectral index @xmath46=0.95 , and dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath47 .",
    "the evolution of large - scale structure with redshift is included in the mocks by stacking different time slices from the n - body simulations along the line of sight .",
    "the simulations resolve dark matter halos down to masses around @xmath48 , sufficiently low to encompass all galaxies above @xmath49 .",
    "this luminosity cut , in turn , is sufficently low to be below the deep2 magnitude cut for the redshift range of interest here , @xmath50 .",
    "we have tested our group - finding methods on mock catalogs created using different halo model parameters , and we find that the results presented in this paper are acceptably robust to such changes ( _ i.e. _ , their effects on the reconstructed group catalog are generally smaller than the cosmic variance ) .    in order to study the impact of galaxy selection effects on our group sample , we produce four distinct subsamples from the mock catalogs . the _ volume - limited _ sample contains all galaxies down to a limiting magnitude @xmath51 ( it is important to note that this catalog is not `` volume - limited '' in the traditional sense , since @xmath52and hence @xmath53varies with redshift in the mock catalogs ) .",
    "the _ magnitude - limited _ sample has had the deep2 magnitude limit of @xmath54 applied , cutting out the faint galaxies in the volume - limited sample in a distance - dependent way ( the mock catalogs do not contain color information , so no color cut is applied ; we simply take the deep2 color criteria to be equivalent to the redshift limit @xmath55 ) .",
    "the _ masked _ sample is the result of applying the deep2 `` mask - making '' algorithm ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) , which schedules galaxies for slitmask spectroscopy , to the magnitude - limited sample . because the amount of space on deimos slitmasks is finite , and because neighboring slits spectra may not overlap , only @xmath56 of suitable target galaxies can be scheduled for observation .",
    "finally , the _ mock deep2 _ sample simulates the effects of redshift failures within the observed deep2 sample . currently , approximately @xmath57 of observed deep2 galaxies can not be assigned a firm redshift , in large part because of the presence of galaxies at @xmath58 , for which no strong spectral features fall in the deep2 wavelength range , but also because of poor observing conditions , low signal - to - noise ratio , or instrumental effects .",
    "the redshift success rate also has some magnitude dependence for faint galaxies , dropping by @xmath59 between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these effects are fully taken into account in the mock deep2 sample . since",
    "this sample is the most similar to the actual deep2 redshift catalog , we will use it to test and calibrate our group - finding algorithm ; we will use the other three samples to study various selection effects .",
    "identifying an unbiased sample of groups and clusters of galaxies in redshift space is notoriously difficult .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , the most obvious and well - known complication is redshift - space distortions : the orbital motions of galaxies in virialized groups cause the observed group members to appear spread out along the line of sight ( the fingers - of - god effect ) , while coherent infall of outside galaxies into existing groups and clusters reduces their separation from group centers in the redshift direction ( the kaiser effect ) . both of these effects confuse group membership by intermingling group members with other nearby galaxies . since it is impossible to separate the peculiar velocity field from the hubble flow without an absolute distance measure , this confusion can never be fully overcome , and it will be a significant source of error in any group - finding program in redshift space . a second complication arises from incomplete sampling of the galaxy population .",
    "no modern galaxy redshift survey can succeed in measuring a redshift for every target galaxy , and it has been shown @xcite that an incomplete galaxy sampling rate always leads to errors in the reconstructed catalog of groups and clusters  even without redshift - space distortions .",
    "in addition , surveys conducted at high redshift and over a broad redshift range present their own impediments to group finding .",
    "the first is simple : distant galaxies appear fainter than nearby galaxies . for example",
    ", the deep2 @xmath26 magnitude limit means that the faintest deep2 galaxies at @xmath62 have luminosities near @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "we are thus probing only relatively rare , luminous galaxies , so only a small fraction of a given group s members will meet our selection criteria .",
    "moreover , galaxies selected with the same criteria will correspond to different samples at different redshifts .",
    "selection in the @xmath63 band ( as is done for deep2 ) corresponds to a rest - frame @xmath64 band selection at @xmath65 and a rest - frame @xmath66 band selection at @xmath67 , meaning that red , early - type galaxies will drop below the limiting magnitude at lower redshifts than blue , star - forming galaxies .",
    "since blue galaxies are observed to be less strongly clustered than red galaxies in deep2 @xcite and locally ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect that the density contrast between group members and isolated galaxies will be weaker for the deep2 sample than it would be for a sample selected in rest - frame @xmath68 , for example .",
    "finally , the very evolution of large - scale structure with redshift that one wishes to probe will pose a problem , since the mass function of dark matter halos will be shifted to lower masses at high redshift , leading to smaller groups and clusters .",
    "a further , more complicated problem is posed by the realities of multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "because of the physical limitations of slitmask or fiber - optic spectrographs , it is difficult to observe all galaxies in densely clustered regions . in deep2 , for example , the minimum deimos slit length is three arcseconds ( approximately @xmath69 kpc at @xmath62 ) ; objects closer than this on the sky can not be observed on the same slitmask ( except in the special case of _ very _ close and appropriately aligned neighbors , which can both be observed on a single slit ) .",
    "this problem is mitigated somewhat by the adaptive scheme for tiling the deep2 cfht imaging with slitmasks , which gives nearly every target at least two chances to be observed ; nevertheless , slit collisions cause us to be biased against observing objects that are strongly clustered on the sky .",
    "moreover , the quality of deimos spectra is degraded somewhat for short slit lengths , due to the difficulty of subtracting night - sky emission for such slits , so we might expect a lower redshift success rate for clustered objects .",
    "figure  [ fig : neigh ] shows the probabilities of observation and redshift success as functions of the distance to an object s third - nearest neighbor on the sky .",
    "( we have chosen the _",
    "third_-nearest neighbor distance because this is a less noisy measure of local density than the simple nearest - neighbor distance . )",
    "clearly we are less likely to observe galaxies in dense regions on the sky , though this effect is relatively weak , and local density appears to have little effect on the redshift success rate .",
    "moreover , as shown in the figure , the vast majority of deep2 targets have neighbors on the sky at distance scales smaller than a typical cluster core radius ( @xmath70 kpc ) .",
    "since we expect a much smaller percentage of galaxies to actually reside in cluster cores , we conclude that a given galaxy s close neighbors are frequently in the foreground or background . hence , although we clearly undersample galaxies in dense regions _ on the sky _ , we are not necessarily undersampling galaxies in dense regions in three - space .",
    "nevertheless , all of the effects discussed in this section , taken together , mean that _",
    "nearly all deep2 groups will have fewer than ten members _ ( see table  [ tab : groups ] ) .",
    "the galaxies in each group will thus represent a very sparse , discrete sampling of the membership of each group .",
    "it is well known that large errors can result when the moments of a distribution are estimated from a sparse sample . in particular , computing velocity dispersions with the usual formula for standard deviation , @xmath71 , will be an unreliable method for such small groups .",
    "@xcite have studied this issue in the context of galaxy clusters .",
    "they assess a number of alternative dispersion estimators and determine the most accurate ones for different ranges in group richness . for the richness range of interest here ,",
    "@xmath72 , they find the most robust method to be the so called `` gapper '' estimator , which measures velocity dispersion using the velocity gaps in a sample according to the formula @xmath73 where the line - of - sight velocities @xmath74 have been sorted into ascending order .",
    "since we expect this estimator to be more accurate than the standard deviation for our purposes , we will measure velocity dispersions as @xmath75 throughout this paper .",
    "furthermore , in this paper we shall always compute velocity dispersions using the _ galaxies _ in a given sample . correcting these values to reflect the velocity dispersions of dark matter halos",
    "will ultimately be necessary for comparison with predictions , but we focus here on measureable quantities and defer this ( theoretical ) issue to future work .",
    "the effects of the deep2 target selection criteria can be seen in figure  [ fig : dropoff ] .",
    "the upper left - hand panel shows the redshift distribution of groups in a single mock deep2 pointing , drawn at random from the mock catalogs , for the volume - limited , magnitude - limited , and masked samples . here a _ group _",
    "is defined to be the set of all galaxies in a given sample that occupy a common dark matter halo , and a group s redshift is given by the median redshift of its member galaxies .",
    "the remaining panels show subsets of these three group catalogs , containing groups above a given threshold in richness @xmath76 or line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath77 .",
    "it is worth noting briefly that , in some redshift bins , the masked sample has _",
    "groups than the magnitude - limited sample from which it is drawn .",
    "this effect is easy to understand : it occurs when group members are discarded , moving the median redshifts of some groups from one bin to another .",
    "the important point , however , is that when the @xmath77 threshold is increased , the discrepancies become smaller between the volume - limited , magnitude - limited and masked samples . on the other hand , these discrepancies increase when the richness threshold is increased : we note in particular the sharp drop - off in groups with @xmath78 between the magnitude - limited and masked sample . evidently groups selected according to observed richness constitute a significantly biased sample , whereas groups selected by observed velocity dispersion can provide a more accurate representation of the full underlying sample .",
    "this result is not surprising .",
    "velocity dispersion is known to scale with halo mass roughly as @xmath79 @xcite , and richness should also scale with @xmath40 . in a magnitude - limited sample , measured",
    "group richnesses will be affected by the flux limit so that more distant groups will have fewer observed members : for example , a group observed to have three members at @xmath80 will actually contain significantly more galaxies than a three - member group observed at @xmath81 . however , sufficiently massive ( _ i.e. _ , high - dispersion and -richness ) groups are nearly certain to enter the observed catalog with more than one member at all redshifts  and hence to be identifiable as groups .",
    "selection effects that reduce the number of galaxies observed in each group will introduce a scatter in the measured velocity dispersions of individual groups .",
    "but above some appropriate critical dispersion , @xmath82 we expect the observed _ distribution _ of group velocity dispersions , @xmath83 , to resemble the true one . in figure",
    "[ fig : group_shrink ] , we see that this expectation is borne out in the deep2 mock catalogs .",
    "although a significant scatter exists in measured group velocity dispersions , the agreement between the @xmath83 distributions for the three mock catalogs improves with increasing @xmath77 . for these reasons , we expect that it will be possible to identify a robust sample of deep2 groups whose @xmath83 distribution is not strongly biased by observational effects .",
    "because we expect any group - finding algorithm to be prone to many different types of error , it is crucial that we define carefully our tolerance for various errors and craft a specific definition of group - finding `` success . '' to begin with , we must establish what we mean when we speak of a galaxy group .",
    "as already noted briefly in section  [ sec : mocks ] , in the spirit of the halo model , we define galaxy groups in terms of dark matter halos .",
    "we define a _ parent halo _ to be a single , virialized halo that contributes one or more galaxies to our sample ; the contributed galaxies we call the halo s _ daughter galaxies_. a _ group _ is then defined to be a set of ( two or more ) galaxies that comprises the daughter galaxies of a single parent halo . _ field galaxies _ are those galaxies that constitute the lone daughters of their respective parent halos .",
    "these definitions are convenient because cosmological tests based on cluster abundance are in reality concerned with the abundance of virialized dark matter halos ; we wish to infer the presence of such objects from the clustering of galaxies . in applying this definition",
    "we consider to be separate groups those halos that are not virialized with respect to each other in a common potential well , but we make no distinction between subhalos within a larger , common virialized halo .",
    "it will also be necessary in what follows to differentiate between _",
    "real groups_those sets of galaxies that actually share the same underlying dark matter halo  and _ reconstructed groups_the sets of galaxies identified as groups by the group finder .",
    "the ideal reconstructed group catalog would be one in which ( _ i _ )",
    "all galaxies that belong to real groups are identified as group members , ( _ ii _ ) no field galaxies are misidentified as group members , ( _ iii _ ) all reconstructed groups are associated with real , virialized dark - matter halos , ( _ iv _ )",
    "all real groups are identified as distinct objects , and ( _ v _ ) these objects contain all of their daughter galaxies and no others . as discussed in section  [ sec : difficulties ] , however , such a catalog is impossible to achieve because of redshift - space distortions and incomplete sampling of the galaxy population",
    ". nevertheless , this ideal will be useful as a means of assessing the veracity of our group catalog .",
    "it is thus important to define a vocabulary with which to compare our group catalog to the ideal one .",
    "we shall make frequent use of the following definitions : a group catalog s _ galaxy - success rate _",
    "@xmath84 is the fraction of galaxies belonging to real groups that are identified as members of reconstructed groups .",
    "_ interlopers _ are field galaxies that are misidentified as group members in the reconstructed catalog , and the _ interloper fraction _",
    "@xmath85 of a group catalog is the fraction of reconstructed group members that are interlopers .",
    "the _ completeness _ @xmath86 of a group catalog is the fraction of real groups that are successfully identified in the reconstructed catalog ( we shall define what it means to be `` successfully identified '' shortly ) ; conversely , the _ purity _ @xmath87 is the fraction of reconstructed groups that correspond to real groups .",
    "_ fragmentation _ occurs when a real group is identified as several smaller groups in the reconstructed catalog , and _ over - merging _ occurs when two or more real groups are identified as a single reconstructed object .",
    "since a perfect group catalog is impossible to achieve , we shall focus our efforts on reproducing certain selected group properties as accurately as possible .",
    "there are many properties we could choose to reproduce for different scientific purposes ; each choice has advantages and drawbacks .",
    "we could , for example , choose to maximize @xmath84 , thus ensuring that our group catalog contains all galaxies that belong to real groups .",
    "such a sample would likely have a high interloper fraction and much over - merging , however ( for example , the easiest way to ensure @xmath88 would be simply to place all galaxies in the sample into a single group ) .",
    "conversely , a group catalog that minimizes the interloper fraction would likely be highly incomplete , sucessfully finding only the cores of the largest groups .",
    "such catalogs might be useful for studies of the properties of galaxies in groups , but they are unlikely to be of much use for studying cosmology or large - scale structure .    a different approach is to gauge success on a group - by - group basis and attempt to maximize completeness , purity , or both . to do this",
    ", we must develop a quantitative measure of our success at reconstructing individual groups ; we will use the concept of the largest group fraction ( lgf ) ( _ cf .",
    "* and references therein ) . to compute the lgf for a given real group @xmath89 , we first find the reconstructed group @xmath90 that contains a plurality of the galaxies in @xmath89 ( the fact that this is not necessarily unique does not concern us , since we will eventually require a majority for a successful reconstruction ) .",
    "the group @xmath90 we call the _ largest associated group _ ( lag ) of @xmath89 .",
    "the lgf @xmath91 of group @xmath89 is then defined as @xmath92 where the notation @xmath93 denotes the number of galaxies in the set @xmath94 . that is , the lgf is the fraction of group @xmath89 that is contained in its lag @xmath90 .",
    "the lgf of a reconstructed group is defined similarly , but with @xmath89 being drawn from the reconstructed catalog and its lag @xmath90 being drawn from the real catalog .",
    "it should be mentioned here that @xmath91 can only be measured for groups in mock catalogs , where we know the real group memberships . in all further discussion of tests involving the lgf",
    ", it should be assumed that these tests take place in mock catalogs .",
    "the lgf statistic allows us to define an unambiguous set of group - finding success measures .",
    "in essence , we declare a successful detection if a group s @xmath91 is greater than some fraction @xmath95 .",
    "for this definition to be unique , we must have @xmath96 , with higher values of @xmath95 implying a more stringent definition of success . for the remainder of this work",
    ", we will set @xmath95 to the minimal value of @xmath97 , since , as we shall see , this definition of success is already quite strict .",
    "however , simply requiring a group to have @xmath98 is insufficient : a real group could meet this criterion but still been merged into a larger object by the group - finder , and a reconstructed group @xmath90 could have @xmath99 if it is a fragment of a larger real group .",
    "for this reason , it will be important to differentiate between one - way matches , in which a group simply has lgf above @xmath95 , and two - way matches , in which a group @xmath89 and its lag @xmath90 satisfy @xmath100 , _ and _ @xmath89 is also the lag of @xmath90 ( see figure  [ fig : successfig ] for a schematic depiction of these success measures ) .",
    "hence we shall differentiate between one - way purity @xmath101 , the fraction of reconstructed groups with @xmath102 , and two - way purity @xmath103 , the fraction of reconstructed groups which are two - way matches with some real group .",
    "similarly , for real groups , we define one - way completeness @xmath104 and two - way completeness @xmath105 . comparing these statistics",
    "can give some indication of systematic errors in the group catalog . a real group that is a one - way success but _",
    "not _ a two - way success has likely been overmerged by the group finder ; therefore if @xmath104 is much larger than @xmath105 we expect that our catalog has been highly over - merged .",
    "similarly , if @xmath101 is significantly greater than @xmath103 , we expect that our catalog is highly fragmented .",
    "our definition of success has another potential problem , however : it requires , minimally , only that we reconstruct half of each group .",
    "thus , a `` successful '' search strategy could seek only the most tightly clustered sets of galaxies and detect only the cores of groups and clusters .",
    "such a group catalog would likely be of high purity , with few interlopers ; it could be useful for identifying groups for follow - up observation in x - ray or sunyaev - zeldovich surveys .",
    "but it would likely have low completeness , and it probably would not accurately reproduce group properties like richness , physical size , or velocity dispersion , making estimates of cluster mass impossible with spectroscopic data alone .    in order to mitigate such difficulties , we must also monitor our success in reproducing group properties . in part , this means we should attempt to accurately measure properties like the velocity dispersion of successfully reconstructed groups on a group - by - group basis .",
    "however , since errors in individual group detections are inevitable with any group finder , we must also determine whether these errors bias the overall distribution of group properties in our catalog .",
    "ultimately it is these statistical _ distributions _ we will want to reproduce as accurately as possible .",
    "for example , if we wish to study the abundance of groups as a function of redshift , @xmath106 , we must take care to ensure that spurious group detections and undetected real groups do not skew this distribution .    clearly",
    ", then , there are many different possible means by which we could gauge our success at group finding .",
    "as we have said , our chosen measure of success will depend strongly on the ultimate scientific purposes of our group catalog . in our case , among other uses ,",
    "we envision using the deep2 group catalog to constrain cosmological parameters . @xcite",
    "have shown that deep2 groups can be used for this purpose if their abundance is measured accurately as a bivariate distribution in velocity dispersion and redshift , @xmath5 .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that the voronoi - delaunay group - finding algorithm can successfully reconstruct this distribution ( down to some limiting velocity dispersion @xmath82 ) ; hence we will seek in this study to maximize the accuracy of our reconstructed @xmath5 above some @xmath82 .",
    "of course , it would be possible in principle to reproduce this distribution by chance with a low - purity , low completeness catalog .",
    "therefore , we will simultaneously strive to maximize the completeness and purity parameters , while also taking care to keep @xmath107 and @xmath108 to guard against fragmentation and over - merging .",
    "indeed , it is always important to monitor these statistics in order to ensure that our reconstructed group catalog corresponds reasonably well with reality .",
    "we do not actively monitor the @xmath84 or @xmath85 parameters when optimizing our group finder , but we anticipate that a catalog that meets our success criteria will also be of reasonably high quality by these measures as well ( this is borne out in section  [ sec : optimize ] ) .    in concluding this section ,",
    "it is important to note that when we speak of group velocity dispersions or redshifts in this paper , we are talking only about the properties as computed from the _ observed group members_. although we will ultimately be interested in the properties of dark matter halos ( which can be predicted theoretically and used to constrain cosmology ) , these can not be measured directly , even in principle . even with a completely error - free group catalog , a theoretical correction would have to be applied to account for the effects of discreteness .",
    "thus we will be interested in reconstructing @xmath5 _ as computed using observed galaxies only_. we make no attempt to reconstruct the distribution as computed for the dark matter or using unobserved galaxies , and we leave computation of theoretical correction factors to future work .",
    "several different techniques have been developed to find groups in spectroscopic redshift samples .",
    "we review them briefly here , as a means of introducing the main issues that will concern us in selecting a group - finding algorithm .",
    "@xcite presented a simple early method for identifying groups and clusters in the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) redshift survey by looking for nearby neighbor galaxies around each galaxy .",
    "commonly known as the _ friends of friends _ or _ percolation _ method , this technique , in its simplest form , defines a linking length @xmath109 and links every galaxy to those neighboring galaxies a distance @xmath109 or less away ( `` friends '' ) .",
    "this procedure produces complexes of galaxies linked together via their neigbors ( `` friends of friends '' ) ; these complexes are identified as groups and clusters .",
    "versions of this algorithm have been widely used to identify groups in local redshift surveys  most recently by @xcite in 2dfgrs  and percolation techniques have also long been used to identify virialized dark - matter halos within n - body simulations .",
    "the percolation algorithm is intuitively attractive because it identifies those regions with an overdensity @xmath110 compared to the background density . the overdensity @xmath111 of virialized objects can be readily computed using the well - known spherical collapse model , yielding an appropriate linking length of @xmath112 for identifying virialized objects in an einstein - de sitter universe @xcite , where @xmath113 is the mean spatial number density of galaxies ( this linking length is somewhat smaller for a @xmath44cdm model , a point which has frequently been ignored in the literature ) .",
    "hence , the percolation algorithm is a natural method for identifying virialized structures in the absence of redshift - space distortions .",
    "unfortunately , working in redshift space can cause serious problems for this algorithm .",
    "the fingers - of - god effect requires that we stretch the linking volume into an ellipsoid or cylinder along the line of sight , which increases the possibility of spurious links . because the percolation method considers each galaxy equally while creating links , then places _ all _ linked galaxies into a given group or cluster",
    ", such false links can lead to catastrophic failures , in which the group finder `` hops '' between several nearby groups , merging them together into a single , falsely detected massive cluster . on the other hand , shrinking the linking volume to avoid this problem increases the chances that a given structure will be fragmented into several smaller structures by the group finder or missed entirely .",
    "these problems have been studied in detail by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .    to combat such difficulties , various other group - finding methods have been developed .",
    "@xcite used the so - called `` hierarchical '' group - finding scheme , originally introduced by @xcite , to find nearby groups .",
    "the hierarchical grouping procedure used is computationally interesting , but in the context of the current model of structure formation it seems to lack theoretical motivation .",
    "more recently , the sdss team has introduced a group - finding algorithm called c4 @xcite , which searches for clustered galaxies in a seven - dimensional space , including the usual three redshift - space dimensions and four photometric colors , on the principle that galaxy clusters should contain a population of galaxies with similar observed colors .",
    "@xcite introduced a three - dimensional `` adaptive matched filter '' algorithm which identifies clusters by adding `` halos '' to a synthesized background mass density and computing the maximum - likelihood mass density .",
    "@xcite found that this algorithm is extremely successful at identifying clusters in spectroscopic redshift surveys , and recently , @xcite have introduced a group - finder that combines elements of the matched filter and percolation algorithms .",
    "finally , @xcite developed a group - finding algorithm  the voronoi - delaunay method ( vdm)that makes use of the voronoi partition and delaunay triangulation of a galaxy redshift survey to identify high - density regions . by performing a targeted , adaptive search in these regions ,",
    "the vdm avoids many of the pitfalls of simple percolation methods ; we will use a version of it in this study .",
    "we note in passing , however , that the matched - filter algorithm is also attractive for deep2 , and we plan to explore its usefulness in future studies .",
    "@xcite showed that the vdm successfully reproduces the distribution of groups in velocity dispersion in a deep2-like sample down to some minimum dispersion @xmath82 .",
    "the algorithm makes use of the three - dimensional voronoi partition of the galaxy redshift catalog , which tiles space with a set of unique polyhedral sub - volumes , each of which contains exactly one galaxy and all points closer to that galaxy than to any other .",
    "the voronoi partition naturally provides information about the clustering properties of galaxies , since galaxies with many neighbors will have small voronoi volumes , while relatively isolated galaxies will have large voronoi volumes .",
    "the algorithm also makes use of the clustering information encoded in the delaunay mesh , which is a complex of line segments linking neighboring galaxies .",
    "mathematically speaking , the delaunay mesh is the geometrical dual of the voronoi partition ; the faces of the voronoi cells are the perpendicular bisectors of the lines in the delaunay mesh .",
    "a two - dimensional visual representation of the voronoi partition and delaunay mesh is shown in figure  [ fig : voronoi ] .",
    "the vdm group - finding algorithm proceeds iteratively through the galaxy catalog in three phases as follows . in phase",
    "i , all galaxies that have not yet been assigned to groups are sorted in ascending order of voronoi volume .",
    "this is mainly a time - saving step , because it allows us to begin our group search with those galaxies in dense regions .",
    "then , for the first galaxy in this sorted list ( the _ seed _ galaxy ) , we define a relatively small cylinder of radius @xmath114 and length @xmath115 , oriented with its axis along the redshift direction .",
    "the dimensions of this and other search cylinders are computed using comoving coordinates . , dark matter halos of a given mass have virial radii that scale roughly as @xmath116 .",
    "hence , clusters of fixed mass have radii that are roughly constant in _ comoving _ coordinates . ] within this cylinder , we find all galaxies that are connected to the seed galaxy by the delaunay mesh ( the _ first - order delaunay neighbors _ ) .",
    "if there are no such galaxies , the seed galaxy is said to be isolated , and the algorithm moves on to the next seed galaxy in the list . by initially searching in a small cylinder ,",
    "we are able to limit the probability of chance associations being misidentified as groups .    if , however , there are one or more first - order delaunay neighbors , we move on to phase ii .",
    "we define a second , larger cylinder , concentric with the first one , with radius @xmath117 and length @xmath118 . within this cylinder , we identify all galaxies that are connected to the seed galaxy or to its first - order delaunay neighbors by the delaunay mesh .",
    "these are the _ second - order delaunay neighbors_. the seed galaxy and its first- and second - order delaunay neighbors constitute a set of @xmath119 galaxies ; we take @xmath119 to be an estimate of the central richness of the group . scaling relations",
    "are known to exist between group mass and radius and velocity dispersion @xcite , and between velocity dipsersion and central richness @xcite .",
    "thus we may estimate the final size of the group from @xmath119 .",
    "in particular , we expect that @xmath120 .",
    "therefore in phase iii we define a third cylinder , centered on the center of mass of the @xmath119 galaxies from phase ii , with radius and half - length given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are free parameters that must be optimized . here , the corrected central richness @xmath124 is scaled to account for the redshift - dependent number density @xmath125 of galaxies in a magnitude - limited survey : @xmath126 we compute @xmath127 by smoothing the redshift distribution of the entire galaxy sample and dividing it by the differential comoving volume element @xmath128 to yield the comoving number density .",
    "all galaxies within the phase iii cylinder ( and any of the @xmath119 galaxies from phase ii that happen to fall outside of it ) are taken to be members of the group .",
    "after a group has been identified , this three - phase process repeated on all remaining galaxies that have not yet been assigned to groups until all galaxies have either been placed into groups or explicitly identified as isolated galaxies .",
    "the astute reader may object here that we have used the central richness @xmath119 to scale our search window , even though we found earlier that richness is a relatively unstable group property within the deep2 sample .",
    "this is true .",
    "however , the groups in our mock catalogs do show some correlation between actual and observed richness , even though the scatter is very large .",
    "furthermore , we have mitigated one major source of error , malmquist bias , with the correction in equation  [ eqn : niicorr ] .",
    "since the dependence of our scaling on @xmath119 is relatively weak , we anticipate that errors in estimating this quantity will not introduce insurmountably large errors into our group sample .",
    "this expectation is borne out by tests on mock catalogs , as will be seen in section  [ sec : optimize ] .",
    "finally , it is important to note some minor differences between our group - finder and the one described in @xcite . in that paper , the scaling factors @xmath122 and @xmath129 in equation  [ eqn : phase3 ] were derived iteratively by running the group - finder first with a best - guess parameter set and then automatically adjusting parameters according to the largest groups found . in tests on mock catalogs , we found this method to be unstable , so we instead choose to optimize our parameters empirically with mock catalogs and then leave them fixed . also , when we search for groups in cylinders , it is important to note that the `` length '' of our cylinders is supposed to correspond to an expected maximum velocity of the galaxies in the group . since the mapping between redshift interval and peculiar velocity changes with redshift , we must rescale the length of our search cylinders as @xmath130\\mathcal{l}_0 $ ] , where the scaling factor @xmath131 is given by @xmath132 for the standard @xmath44cdm cosmology .",
    "this scaling amounts to a @xmath133 effect over the redshift range of the deep2 survey .",
    "we apply it to the cylinder in each phase , taking a reference redshift of @xmath134 .      to gauge the success of our group - finding algorithm , we will make use of the mock deep2 sample described in section  [ sec : mocks ] .",
    "each galaxy in these catalogs is tagged with the name of its parent halo , making the identification of real groups a simple matching exercise .",
    "thus , we have a catalog of real groups , identified from n - body models in real space , against which we can compare the results of applying the vdm algorithm to the mock galaxy catalog projected in redshift space . to compute completeness and purity , we simply apply equation  ( [ eqn : lgf ] ) to the real and reconstructed group catalogs .    as a rough measure of the accuracy of our reconstructed distribution , @xmath135",
    ", we apply a two - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test to this distribution and the real distribution , @xmath136 , to determine whether they are statistically distinguishable .",
    "@xcite found that the vdm group - finder should accurately reproduce this distribution above @xmath137 , so we apply the k - s test only above this velocity dispersion . the test is insensitive to the total number of groups in each sample , so we must independently ensure that the two distributions have the same normalization .",
    "to do this , we simply count the total number of groups with @xmath138 .",
    "we want to ensure that the real and reconstructed normalizations match to better than the expected cosmic variance for our sample ( about @xmath139 for the abundance of groups with @xmath140 ) , so that our final errors are dominated by cosmic variance .",
    "guided by simple physical considerations ( _ e.g. _ , the expected velocity dispersion range of groups and clusters ) , we explore the space of vdm parameters @xmath141 and @xmath123 , using trial and error to narrow our parameter range down to a range that produces an @xmath135 that is statistically indistinguishable from @xmath136 ( less than 1% confidence that the two distributions are different ) and properly normalized . at the same time",
    ", we monitor the completeness and purity of the reconstructed group catalog requiring , minimally , that @xmath105 and @xmath103 remain above @xmath142 and attempting to increase them as much as possible .",
    "the procedure described above is simple to implement and perform ; however , it is ultimately an insufficient test of our success .",
    "it asks only whether or not @xmath135 and @xmath136 appear , in a statistical sense , to have been drawn from the same distribution .",
    "but we want to know whether or not @xmath135 is an accurate _ reconstruction _ of @xmath143 ; for the two distributions to pass a k - s test is a necessary but not a sufficient condition . in order to fully optimize our parameters , we must aim to reduce any systematic error in @xmath144 to a level below the cosmic variance .",
    "thus , we will want to assess our error in reconstructing the acutal velocity function @xmath143 in a given field , irrespective of cosmic variance , and then compare our reconstruction error to the expected cosmic variance in that field .",
    "as long as the systematic error is smaller than the cosmic variance , it will not be a significant source of error in our measurement of the velocity function . to estimate our systematic error",
    ", we apply the vdm group finder to twelve independent deep2 fields and compute the mean fractional residuals @xmath145 , which constitute a measurment of the fractional systematic reconstruction error . the uncertainty in determining @xmath146",
    "is then given by the standard error in this quantity , @xmath147 .",
    "we have used _ fractional _ errors here , rather than absolute errors , to distinguish errors in reconstruction from the intrinsic scatter ( cosmic variance ) in @xmath148 and @xmath149 . we can then measure the fractional cosmic variance ( plus poisson noise ) @xmath150 from the mock catalogs and compare it to the systematic error @xmath146 .",

    "as shown in the upper panel of the figure , systematic reconstruction errors in @xmath156 are dominated by cosmic variance for @xmath157 , while we significantly overestimate the abundance of lower - dispersion groups .",
    "if we discard the reconstructed groups with @xmath158 , systematic errors in the @xmath159 distribution are also smaller than the cosmic variance , as shown in the bottom panel of the figure .",
    "we note that we have been able to do somewhat better than expected , reconstructing the velocity function accurately down to @xmath160 , slightly lower than the cutoff of @xmath161 expected from @xcite .",
    "the fact that these one - dimensional distributions are accurately measured to within the cosmic variance is heartening , but to fully optimize our group - finder we must ensure that the full two - dimensional distribution @xmath162 is accurately measured .",
    "figure  [ fig : group_dist_errs_2d ] shows smoothed contour plots of the mean fractional systematic errors @xmath163 in this distribution , the uncertainty @xmath164 in this quantity , the fractional cosmic variance @xmath154 , and the ratio of the systematic error to the cosmic variance .",
    "the panel at the lower right shows that significant , correlated overestimates of the distribution are confined to low velocity dispersion . for @xmath165 , on the other hand ,",

    "we note that this minimum velocity dispersion is not a limitation of the vdm group - finder  a more densely sampled survey would permit @xmath5 to be reconstructed down to even lower dispersions @xcite . more generally , it is important to recognize that the conclusions reached here apply only to the deep2 survey : a survey probing significantly greater volume , for example , would have smaller cosmic variance , perhaps necessitating a more accurate reconstruction of @xmath5 than has been presented here .    after running the vdm on the 12 mock samples using the optimal parameter set in table  [ tab : optimal ]",

    "these statistics are nearly independent of the velocity dispersion of the groups being considered .",
    "the fact that @xmath174 and @xmath175 are small suggests that our catalogs are largely free of fragmentation or over - merging .",

    "this quantity is indicated by the dashed line in figure 13 ; the data appear to be consistent with it at velocity dispersions @xmath195 .    below this threshold",
    "a slight discrepancy remains : the data points lie significantly above the dashed line at low dispersions .",
    "however , one would naively expect the velocity function reconstructed from the data to be everywhere consistent with the one reconstructed in the mock catalogs , if the mocks are a good simulation of the data .",
    "it is difficult to assess the significance of the discrepancy shown here , since we have not optimized our group - finder to measure the abundance of such low - dispersion groups , but it appears that the the mock catalogs may be inconsistent with the deep2 data on small velocity scales .",

    "the more scientifically interesting `` data - to - prediction '' comparison shown by the solid line in figure  [ fig : dist_comp ] then stands as evidence that an accurate reconstruction of the velocity function for @xmath196 is possible in deep2 , providing the first step necessary to placing constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "we have optimized the vdm group - finding algorithm using mock catalogs designed to replicate the deep2 survey , and we have applied it to spectroscopic data from three deep2 photometric pointings . in the process of optimization , we have defined a measure of group finding success that focuses on accurately reproducing the overall properties of the group catalog  in particular the distribution of groups in redshift and velocity dispersion , @xmath162while paying some attention also to the accurate reconstruction of individual groups .",

    "<S> we use the first 25% of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey spectroscopic data to identify groups and clusters of galaxies in redshift space . </S>",
    "<S> the data set contains 8370 galaxies with confirmed redshifts in the range @xmath0 , over one square degree on the sky . </S>",
    "<S> groups are identified using an algorithm ( the voronoi - delaunay method ) that has been shown to accurately reproduce the statistics of groups in simulated deep2-like samples . </S>",
    "<S> we optimize this algorithm for the deep2 survey by applying it to realistic mock galaxy catalogs and assessing the results using a stringent set of criteria for measuring group - finding success , which we develop and describe in detail here . </S>",
    "<S> we find in particular that the group - finder can successfully identify @xmath1 of real groups and that @xmath2 of the galaxies that are true members of groups can be identified as such . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , we estimate that @xmath3 of the groups we find can be definitively identified with real groups and that @xmath4 of the galaxies we place into groups are interloper field galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , we find that it is possible to measure the distribution of groups in redshift and velocity dispersion , @xmath5 , to an accuracy limited by cosmic variance , for dispersions greater than @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that such measurements will allow strong constraints to be placed on the equation of state of the dark energy in the future . finally , we present the first deep2 group catalog , which assigns 32% of the galaxies to 899 distinct groups with two or more members , 153 of which have velocity dispersions above @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we provide locations , redshifts and properties for this high - dispersion subsample . </S>",
    "<S> this catalog represents the largest sample to date of spectroscopically detected groups at @xmath7 . </S>"
