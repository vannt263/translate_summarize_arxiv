    "black holes ( bh ) are physical entities that provide insight into the foundations of ( quantum- ) gravity theories .",
    "such objects are characterized by three basic properties : mass , angular momentum , and charge . among these properties",
    "the most fundamental is the mass , which characterizes all bhs .",
    "angular momentum is only relevant for rotating ( kerr ) bhs while charge is less relevant for astrophysical bhs .",
    "currently , the best evidence for the existence of bh is astrophysical .",
    "in particular , a broad range of bh masses is implied by astronomical observations : from solar mass bhs as the end products of massive stars to supermassive bhs ( smbh ) at the centers of galaxies with masses that may easily exceed a million solar masses @xcite .",
    "perhaps the first evidence for the presence of smbh at the centers of galaxies is associated with quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei ( to which we shall henceforth refer to , generally , as quasars ) . in those objects , gas from the medium surrounding the smbh , that is able to lose angular momentum and spiral inwards ,",
    "eventually accretes onto it . as the gas accretes",
    ", its gravitational energy is effectively converted to radiation with most of the emitted flux originating from the immediate vicinity of the smbh , where the gas reaches the highest temperatures @xcite .",
    "the mass of smbhs in small samples of low redshift non - active galaxies has been measured using , for example , maser- and stellar - kinematics @xcite . for most low redshift galaxies ,",
    "smbh mass estimation is , however , indirect and involves scaling relations that were derived for small samples of objects for which direct mass measurements were possible @xcite .",
    "as one attempts to estimate the mass of black holes at higher redshifts , various complications arise : it is not clear that locally determined scaling laws apply also to higher redshift objects since galaxies and their environments evolve with cosmic time .",
    "furthermore , high redshift objects discovered by flux - limited samples are often much brighter than their low-@xmath0 counterparts , and it is yet to be established whether extrapolated relations are at all relevant in that regime @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , direct smbh mass determination of intermediate- and high - redshift objects is the most reliable way to further our understanding of smbh - galaxy formation and co - evolution , and to reach a reliable census of black holes in the universe .",
    "direct mass determination of smbhs at high redshifts is currently limited to quasars , which are among the brightest objects in the universe and are powered by the smbh itself . while quasars certainly trace the galaxy population , they also present a particular epoch in a galaxy lifetime , in which the black hole is accreting gas , and is at a stage of rapid growth .",
    "therefore , better understanding of the smbh demography in low- and high-@xmath0 quasars has far - reaching implications for galaxy / black - hole formation and co - evolution @xcite .    a reliable method to directly measure the mass of smbhs in quasars involves the reverberation mapping of the broad emission line region ( blr ) in those objects @xcite .",
    "this region is known to be photo - ionized by the central continuum source @xcite , and its emission , in the form of broad permitted emission lines , is seen to react to continuum variations .",
    "studies have shown that the blr lies at distances , @xmath1 , that are much larger than the smbh schwarzschild radius , and also larger than the size of the continuum emitting region , i.e. , the accretion disk .",
    "that being said , the blr lies at small enough distances so that its kinematics is primarily set by the smbh , which has a prominent contribution to the gravitational potential on those scales . that this is the case may be deduced from the velocity dispersion of the emitted gas , as inferred from the width of the broad emission lines , which is typically of order a few@xmath2 , as well as from the fact that , in luminous quasars , line variations lag behind relatively rapid continuum variations with typical time delays , @xmath3days , where @xmath4 is the speed of light ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "technically , reverberation mapping involves multi - epoch spectroscopic observations so that continuum and emission line variations may be individually traced @xcite .",
    "continuum and emission line light curves can then be used to infer the size of the broad emission line region using a cross - correlation analysis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and  2.2 ) .",
    "by measuring @xmath1 and the velocity dispersion of the gas ( via spectral modeling of the emission line profile and by defining a measure of the velocity dispersion of the gas ) , the smbh mass may be deduced , up to a geometrical factor of order unity @xcite .",
    "mass determinations using this technique have been shown to be consistent with the results of other independent methods @xcite , and are thought to be accurate to within 0.5dex @xcite .",
    "nowadays , reverberation mapping has a central role in determining smbh masses in active galaxies and for shedding light on the physics of the central engine in these objects .",
    "nevertheless , despite several decades of spectroscopic monitoring of quasars , reliable blr sizes and corresponding smbh mass measurements have been determined for only a few dozens of low-@xmath0 objects @xcite . using the results of reverberation mapping ,",
    "various scaling relations were found and quantified including , for example , the @xmath1 ( or smbh mass ) vs. quasar luminosity relation @xcite , the smbh mass vs. the quasar s optical spectral properties relation @xcite , and the black hole - host galaxy bulge mass relation in quasars @xcite .    despite being derived from small samples of nearby objects ,",
    "the aforementioned relations are often extrapolated to reflect on the quasar population as a whole @xcite , sometimes with little justification @xcite .",
    "potential biases arising from uncertain extrapolations to high redshifts , or to different sub - classes of quasars , may crucially affect our understanding of black hole growth and structure formation over cosmic time @xcite .",
    "clearly , an efficient way to implement the reverberation mapping technique is highly desirable as it would alleviate many of the uncertainties currently plaguing the field .    motivated by upcoming photometric surveys that will cover a broad range of wavelengths and",
    "will regularly monitor a fair fraction of the sky with good photometric accuracy ( e.g. , the _ large synoptic survey telescope _",
    ", lsst ) , we aim to provide proof - of - concept that photometric reverberation mapping of the blr in quasars is feasible . in a nut shell , instead of spectrally separating line and continuum light curves from multi - epoch spectroscopic observations , we take advantage of the different variability properties of continuum and line processes and separate them at the light curve level . in this work",
    "we have no intention to address the full scope of issues associated with time - series analysis but rather hope to trigger further observational and theoretical work in broadband reverberation mapping of quasar blrs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 presents the photometric approach to reverberation mapping using analytic means and by resorting to simulations of quasar light curves .",
    "the reliability of the photometric method for line - to - continuum time lag measurement is investigated by means of simulations in  3 . in ",
    "4 we apply the method to a subset of the palomar - green ( pg ) quasar sample @xcite , for which previous measurements of the blr size are available @xcite .",
    "summary follows in  5 .",
    "here we present the algorithm for reverberation mapping the broad emission line regions in quasars using broadband photometric means .",
    "we first describe our model for quasar light curves (  2.1 ) and then analyze them using new statistical methods that are developed in  2.2 .      to demonstrate the feasibility of photometric reverberation mapping , we first resort to simulations . specifically , we rely on current knowledge of the typical spectrum of quasars , and the variability properties of such objects , to construct a model for the light curves in different spectral bands .",
    "quasar light - curves are reminiscent of red noise , following a power spectrum @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the angular frequency ) with @xmath7 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "here we model the pure continuum light - curve in some band @xmath8 as a sum of discrete fourier components , each with a random phase @xmath9 : @xmath10 the amplitude of each fourier mode , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is time .",
    "we define the normalized variability measure , @xmath13 [ c.f . @xcite who express this in per - cent ] , where @xmath14 is the mean flux of the light - curve , @xmath15 is its standard deviation , and @xmath16 is the mean measurement uncertainty of the light curve . for the palomar - green ( pg ) sample of quasars @xcite , the continuum normalized variability measure @xmath17 @xcite and , typically , @xmath18 ( see table 1 ) . a light - curve realization , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ lc ] .",
    "quasar emission occurs over a broad range of photon energies , from radio to hard x - ray wavelengths and originates from spatially distinct regions in the quasar . in the optical bands ,",
    "there is some evidence for red continua to lag behind blue continua @xcite . without loss of generality ,",
    "we associate the @xmath21-band with the redder parts of the spectrum so that its instantaneous continuum flux may be expressed as a function of the flux in the @xmath8-band , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the continuum transfer function , satisfy the normalization condition @xmath24 . ] .",
    "presently , @xmath25 is poorly constrained by observations and only the inter - band continuum time delay , @xmath26 , is loosely determined ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , so long as @xmath27 , the particular form of @xmath25 is immaterial to our discussion ( see  3.2.3 ) . for simplicity , we shall therefore take @xmath25 to be a gaussian with a mean of @xmath26 and a standard deviation @xmath28 .",
    "emission by photo - ionized ( blr ) gas is naturally sensitive to the continuum level of the ionizing source . in particular , for typical blr densities and distances from the smbh , the response time of the photoionized gas to continuum variations is much shorter than the light travel time across the region , and so may be considered instantaneous . therefore , the flux in some line @xmath29 , which is emitted by the blr , can be written , in the linear approximation , as @xmath30 where the transfer function @xmath31 depends , essentially , on the geometry of the blr region as seen from the direction of the observer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "our present knowledge of @xmath32 for the quasar population as a whole , is , however , rather limited [ see @xcite for a few relevant forms for @xmath33 . in what follows",
    "we shall consider two forms for the transfer function : a ) a gaussian kernel with a mean @xmath34 and a standard deviation @xmath35 , and b ) a transfer function with a flat core in the range @xmath36 , with a following linear decline to zero at @xmath37 ( such a transfer function also results in a time - lag being @xmath38 ) .",
    "the latter transfer function is motivated by the observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc4151 @xcite and corresponds to a case where a geometrically thick , spherical shell of broad emission line gas isotropically encompasses the continuum emitting region .",
    "the different transfer functions defined above will henceforth be termed ( a ) the gaussian and ( b ) the thick - shell blr models .",
    "the transfer functions are depicted in figure [ trans ] .",
    "the main qualitative difference between the two transfer functions , as far as light curve behavior is concerned , is that while the gaussian one is relatively localized in time , the thick shell blr model is much broader , and results in longer range correlations between the light curves of the two bands .",
    "unless otherwise stated , our results are presented for the gaussian model .",
    "cases for which we find a qualitative difference between the two transfer functions are explicitly treated ( e.g. ,  3.2.5 ) .",
    "a simulated light - curve of an emission line that is driven by continuum variations ( assuming @xmath39days ) is shown in figure [ lc ] ( blue curves ) .",
    "time - delay and smearing effects , with respect to the continuum light - curve , are clearly visible . here too , we define a normalized variability measure for the line , @xmath40 , and consider @xmath41 ( * ? ?",
    "* see their table 5 ) .",
    "the sum of continuum and lines emission to the total flux in band @xmath21 is therefore given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total flux in the emission lines .",
    "while a similar expression applies , in principle , also for the total flux in band @xmath8 , unless otherwise stated , we shall assume that @xmath44 , i.e. , that emission line contribution to band @xmath8 is either negligible or that the line variability associated with it operates on timescales that are much too short to be resolved by the cadence of the experiment , or too long to be detectable in the time - series .",
    "for simplicity , we shall limit our discussion to a single emission line contributing to the @xmath21-band ( this restriction is relaxed in  3.2.4 ) .",
    "the contribution of the emission line(s ) to the total flux in the @xmath21-band requires knowledge of the equivalent width of the broad emission line , @xmath45 [ typically @xmath46  in the optical band for strong lines @xcite ] , the transmission curve of the broadband filter , as well as the redshift of the quasar .",
    "for example , for filters with sharp features in their response function , even small redshift changes could lead to substantial differences in the relative contribution of the emission line to the total flux in the band , @xmath47 .",
    "for a flat filter response function over a wavelength range @xmath48 ( typically , @xmath49  for broadband filters ) , @xmath50 .",
    "( a more accurate treatment of the line contribution to the broadband flux for the case of johnson - cousins filters is given in  4 . )",
    "example light - curves for the @xmath8 and @xmath21 bands , assuming @xmath51 , are shown in figure [ lc ] . in the following calculations",
    ", we shall work with normalized light - curves that have a zero mean and a unit variance , i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "the spectroscopic approach to measuring the size of the blr cross - correlates pure line and continuum light - curves so that the position of the peak ( or the center of mass ) of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) , @xmath53 , marks the line to continuum time - delay ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , line and continuum light curves can not be disentangled using pure broadband photometric means and the data include only their combined signal .",
    "in fact , light - curves in different bands are rather similar due to the dominant contribution of highly correlated continuum emission processes ( fig .",
    "therefore , a naive analysis in which the ccf between the light curves of different bands is calculated would reflect more on @xmath26 than on @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ acfccf ] ) .    seeking to measure the time - delay between line and continuum processes using broadband photometric means , it is important to realize that instead of spectrally distinguishing between line and continuum light curves , it is possible , under certain circumstances , to separate these processes at the light curve level . in particular , the line light curve , @xmath54 since @xmath55 .",
    "this is justified for quasars since the continuum auto - correlation timescale [ @xmath56days @xcite , possibly reflecting on viscous timescales in the accretion flow ] is much longer than @xmath26 [ being of order days @xcite and resulting from irradiation processes in the accretion disk , which take place on light travel time scales ] .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath44 , @xmath57 , and we obtain , @xmath58 where the rightmost term is just the difference between the ccf of the light - curves and the auto - correlation function ( acf ) of the light curve with the negligible line contribution ( see  3.2 for cases in which emission lines contribute also to @xmath59 ) . graphically , this difference is simply the shaded region shown in the left panel of figure [ acfccf ] , which arises due to correlated line and continuum processes adding power on @xmath34-scales . using these statistics , and given a rather non - restrictive set of assumptions ( see more in  3 ) , it seems , in principle , possible to recover the line - to - continuum time - delay using _ pure _ broadband photometric data .",
    "in particular , for the example shown in figure [ acfccf ] , @xmath60 peaks at the correct time - lag , and is in agreement with the time - lag estimate as obtained using the spectroscopic method , i.e. , using @xmath61 .",
    "the estimator defined by equation [ theta ] provides a good approximation for @xmath61 in cases where the emission line contribution to the band is sub - dominant ( see below ) . for the more general case ( e.g. , when narrow band filters are concerned ) ,",
    "it is possible to define a somewhat more generalized version where @xmath62 , which is applicable for cases in which the emission line contribution to the @xmath21-band is considerable or even dominant . for @xmath63 , as appropriate for broadband photometry , @xmath64 . ] .",
    "nevertheless , with this definition , @xmath47 needs to be observationally known , which is not always the case , especially when large ( photometric ) redshift uncertainties are concerned , the filter response function has sharp features @xcite , or the quasar spectrum , if available , is noisy .",
    "focusing on broadband photometric light curves in this work , the contribution of emission lines to the band is , typically , of order a few per cent ( see  4 ) .",
    "we therefore restrict the following discussion to @xmath60 as defined by equation [ theta ] .",
    "it is possible to define an additional statistical estimator to measure line to continuum time - delays using broadband photometry .",
    "specifically , by using the fact that , for broadband filters and to zeroth order approximation , @xmath65 ( see fig . [ lc ] ) , we may approximate @xmath60 by @xmath66 this estimator is just the difference between the acfs of the light - curves in each band . a more intuitive way to understand the above definition may be gained by looking at figure [ acfccf ] , where the acf of filter @xmath21 shows more power on @xmath34 timescales due to relatively long - term correlations between line and continuum processes .",
    "in contrast , the acf of filter @xmath8 , being devoid of line emission , does not show a corresponding power - excess .",
    "we note that both definitions of @xmath67 are quasi anti - symmetric with respect to @xmath8 and @xmath21 exchange .",
    "we find that , as far as @xmath34 measurements are concerned , both estimators , @xmath60 and @xmath68 , give , in principle , consistent results ( see fig .",
    "[ acfccf ] ) .",
    "while @xmath60 has the advantage of being a more reliable estimator of @xmath61 ( see more in  3 ) , @xmath68 has the advantage of not containing a cross - correlation term of the form @xmath69 .",
    "this property allows one to evaluate @xmath68 even in cases where non - contemporaneous light curves are available so long as a ) both light curves are adequately sampling the line transfer function , and b ) quasar variability results from a stationary process ( see  3.2.5 ) .",
    "moreover , if the variability properties for an ensemble of objects ( of some given property ) are statistically similar , and the auto - correlation terms , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , are well determined in the statistical sense ( see  3.1.1 ) , then it is not required for the same objects to be observed in both bands .",
    "this opens up the possibility of monitoring different parts of the sky in each band , and using the acquired data to statistically measure the mean line to continuum time - delay .",
    "that being said , large ensembles may be required to achieve a reliable measurement of @xmath34 since @xmath68 is , in fact , an approximation to an approximation of @xmath61 , and its results are expected to be somewhat less reliable than both @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( this is further discussed in  3 ) .",
    "a note is in order concerning the maximal value of @xmath72 and @xmath73 . unlike the spectroscopic technique where @xmath74 is , in fact ,",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient and its value measures how well continuum and line processes are correlated at any @xmath75 , for the photometric estimators defined here , the peak value depends also on the relative contribution of the emission line(s ) to the broad band flux .",
    "the latter depends not only on the properties of the quasar , but also on the transmission curve of the broadband filter , the variability measure of the line , and the redshift of the object .",
    "therefore , the significance of the result is not directly implied by the value of the peak in @xmath68 and @xmath60 , and quantifying it requires a different approach , as we shall discuss in ",
    "while the reliability of the spectroscopic reverberation mapping technique has been assessed in numerous works [ e.g. , @xcite and references therein ] , we have yet to demonstrate it for the photometric method . in this section",
    "we take a purely theoretical approach and use a suite of monte carlo simulations to test the method and quantify its strengths and weaknesses .",
    "all light curves are finite with respect to their duration time , @xmath76 , as well as the sampling interval , @xmath77 .",
    "this fact alone introduces potentially substantial `` noise '' in the cross - correlation analyses ( whether photometric or spectroscopic ) .",
    "the effect of finite sampling is seen in fig .",
    "[ ensembles ] ( left panels ) where the light curves of individual objects are analyzed , showing that @xmath78 formally peak at values that could be significantly removed from @xmath34 .",
    "this implies that even in the ideal case , where measurement noise is negligible , the deduced time - lag might be significantly offset from the true value .",
    "while similar situations occur also with spectroscopic data , our simulations indicate that the photometric estimators are , statistically , more prone to such effects .",
    "in addition to finite sampling there is measurement noise , which reflects on the ability of any statistical estimator to recover the true time - lag with good accuracy . on an individual case basis ,",
    "the effect of noise is seen to give rise to more erratic @xmath60 and @xmath68 behavior , potentially leading to substantial deviations in the position of the peak from the true time - lag .",
    "in fact , for the particular case shown ( fig . [ ensembles ] )",
    ", @xmath60 has a kink at @xmath34 and peaks only at @xmath79 . in this particular case",
    ", @xmath68 happens to be less affected by noise , and formally peaks at @xmath80 due to a narrow feature being the result of noise .",
    "sampling and measurement noise are manifested as small scale fluctuations in all statistical estimators . in particular , in some cases ( see figs . [ ensembles ] & [ smooth ] ) , large amplitude fluctuations are observed , which peak at long timescales , @xmath81 , and their value could exceed the value of the true peak ( i.e. , that which is associated with , and peaks at , @xmath82 ) .",
    "clearly , an algorithm that would aid to properly identify the relevant signal , would be of advantage .",
    "to this end we use a physically - motivated algorithm related to the geometry of the blr : the fact that the blr encompasses the continuum emitting region means that the width of its line transfer function should be of order the time - lag .",
    "therefore , one expects the relevant signal in @xmath78 to peak at @xmath34 with a width , @xmath83 . in particular , narrower features with @xmath84",
    "are likely to be merely the result of noise or sampling , and although they could reach large amplitudes , they are of little relevance to the time - lag measurement .",
    "the aforementioned properties of the line transfer function motivate us to consider the following algorithm to aid in the identification of the time - lag : we resample @xmath60 and @xmath68 onto a uniform logarithmic grid , which preserves resolution in @xmath85 units .",
    "we then apply a running mean algorithm such that the boxcar size corresponds to a fixed range in logarithmic scale .",
    "this procedure smooths out narrow features having @xmath86 . examples for smoothed statistical estimators are shown for two levels of noise in figure [ smooth ]",
    ". clearly , narrow features at large @xmath75 are significantly suppressed without diminishing the power of similar @xmath87 features centered at smaller @xmath75 . it should be noted , however , that using this technique does not assure that the correct time - lag is recovered ( see above ) .",
    "furthermore , in some cases , multiple peaks may be found and additional methods are required to assess their significance ( see  4 ) .",
    "testing for the accuracy of time - lag measurements using noisy data , we have conducted uniformly sampled light curves simulations of a quasar ( 100 realizations were used having 800 points in each light curve , with a total light curve duration , @xmath76 , satisfying @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) at several levels of measurement noise . for each realization ,",
    "@xmath60 was calculated and @xmath75 where it peaks was identified with @xmath90 and logged .",
    "the resulting time - lag statistics are shown in figure [ smooth1 ] .",
    "the distribution is clearly non - gaussian and shows a peak at the input time lag with a tail extending to long time - lags .",
    "not unexpectedly , the dispersion in time - lag measurements increases with the noise level .",
    "for the particular examples shown , taking @xmath91 [ a noise level typical of photometric light curves of quasars @xcite ] , @xmath92% of the measurements will result in @xmath93 being within @xmath94% of the true lag .",
    "for noisier data with @xmath95 , only @xmath96% of all realizations result in a time lag within @xmath97% of the true time lag .",
    "these calculations demonstrate that photometric reverberation mapping in the presence of measurement noise typical of photometrically monitored quasars is indeed feasible , and that the measurement is , in principle , reliable .",
    "when noisier data are concerned , the uncertainty on the time - lag is larger .    to better quantify the ability of the photometric method to uncover the time - lag under various observing strategies",
    ", we repeated the above analysis for two noise levels ( @xmath98 ) while varying the number of points in the light curves ( i.e. , observing visits ) .",
    "more specifically , we maintained a fixed @xmath88 and varied the sampling period , @xmath77 ( we made sure that @xmath99 so that the blr transfer function is never under - sampled ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations were carried out to obtain reliable statistics , and we report the one standard deviations of the measured time - lag distributions , @xmath100 , in figure [ 1sigma ] ( also shown , for comparison , are the corresponding @xmath61-statistics ) .",
    "as expected , better sampled light curves result in a lower dispersion in @xmath90 for all statistical methods .",
    "also , unsurprisingly , @xmath60 is the more reliable photometric estimator for the time - lag , and both photometric estimators are worse than @xmath61 . in particular , quasar light curves having @xmath101 points in each filter with photometric errors of order 1% result in a @xmath60-deduced time - lag dispersion of order @xmath102 .",
    "similar quality light curves can be found in the literature @xcite , and are analyzed in  4 .",
    "consider the following question : having finite resources , is it better to observe fewer objects with better cadence or more objects having sparser light curves ?",
    "[ we assume that the _ cadence is adequate _ for sampling the line transfer function ( see more in  3.2 ) , and that the same signal - to - noise is reached in both cases . ]",
    "the answer to this question is given in figure [ 1sigma ] ( right panel ) where the total number of visits was kept fixed yet the number of objects in the ensemble varied ( correspondingly , the number of visits per object changed to maintain their product constant ) .",
    "interestingly , for the same observing effort , it is advantageous to observe more objects with worse cadence . using this strategy , one is less sensitive to unfavorable variability patterns of particular quasars .",
    "for the case considered here , the time - lag uncertainty drops by a factor @xmath103 by increasing the sample size from one to ten objects ( the uncertainty for the case of ensembles was determined from monte carlo simulations of many statistically similar ensembles ) .",
    "similar results are obtained also for @xmath68 ( not shown ) .      in the upcoming era of large surveys",
    ", statistical information may be gathered for many objects .",
    "for example , the lsst is expected to provide photometric light curves for @xmath104 quasars having a broad range of luminosities and redshifts . with such large sets of data at one s disposal , sub - samples of quasars",
    "may be considered having a prescribed set of properties ( e.g. , luminosity and redshift ) , and the line to continuum time - lag measurement may be quantified for the ensembles . in this case , it is possible to measure the characteristic line - to - continuum time - delay in two ways : by measuring the peak of @xmath105 or @xmath106 on a case by case basis and then constructing time - lag distributions to measure their moments , or by defining the ensemble averages of the statistical estimators .",
    "specifically , we define @xmath107 as the arithmetic averages .",
    "these definitions were , in fact , previously used to compute the curves shown in figure [ acfccf ] .",
    "] of the corresponding statistical estimators at every @xmath75 .",
    "( alternative definitions for the mean do not seem to be particularly advantageous and are not considered here . )",
    "the average statistical estimators for ensembles of varying sizes are shown in figure [ ensembles ] .",
    "as expected , averaging leads to a more robust measurement of the peak , as the various @xmath108 s `` constructively - interfere '' at @xmath82 .",
    "the ensemble size required to reach a time - lag measurement of a given accuracy naturally depends on the noise level .",
    "we find that measuring the time - lag from the peak of @xmath109 ( or @xmath110 ) is more accurate than measuring the time - lags for individual objects in the ensemble , and then quantifying the moments of the distribution ( fig .",
    "[ 1sigma ] ) , was calculated by simulating numerous statistically - equivalent ensembles of objects , calculating @xmath109 , and measuring the time - lag from its peak .",
    "a time - lag distribution is obtained with the uncertainty given by its standard deviation , @xmath111 . ] .",
    "this is particularly important when noisy data are concerned , in which case reliable time - lag measurements for individual objects are difficult if not impossible to obtain .",
    "to see this , we note the rising uncertainty on the deduced time - lag , @xmath112 , as the number of visits per object is reduced ( and despite the fact that a correspondingly larger sample of objects is considered ; see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ 1sigma ] for a case in which @xmath113 ) .",
    "in contrast , when working with @xmath109-statistics , the uncertainty monotonically declines so long as the sampling of the transfer function is adequate .",
    "the above analysis highlights the importance of using large samples of objects ( even with less than ideal sampling ) in addition to studying individual objects having relatively well - sampled light curve .",
    "in particular , by using large enough samples of quasars , the effects of noise , and even sparse sampling , may be overcome .",
    "current studies suggest that there is a scatter of 30%-40% in the blr size vs. quasar luminosity relation @xcite . to assess the effect of such a scatter on @xmath109",
    "( similar results apply also for @xmath110 ) , we averaged the results for an ensemble of simulated objects whose time - lags follow a gaussian distribution with a mean @xmath114 and standard deviation @xmath115 .",
    "we modify this gaussian such that the input lag is always positive definite : for @xmath116 the distribution is gaussian while for @xmath117 there is an excess of systems with zero lag .",
    "@xmath118 , is shown in figure [ lrs ] : evidently , the average statistical estimator peaks at the mean of the distribution so long as @xmath119 . for larger ratios ,",
    "the distribution considerably deviates from gaussian and its mean is @xmath120 . in this case",
    ", @xmath118 still peaks around the mean but its shape is highly asymmetric .",
    "this is partly due to the time - lag distribution , but also so due the fact that the transfer functions with the largest @xmath34 s are not adequately sampled by the light curve ( @xmath121 was assumed ) . to conclude , photometric reverberation should yield accurate mean blr sizes for a sample of quasars , given the observed scatter in the blr properties .",
    "we identified several potentially important biases in the method , which we shall now quantify using a suite of monte carlo simulations .",
    "we work in the limit of large ensembles so that the effect of sampling and measurement noise are negligible ( typically , the results of several hundreds of realizations are averaged over and the line to continuum time delay is identified with the peak of @xmath118 and @xmath122 ) .",
    "biases are present in the time - lag measurement from noisy data .",
    "these are negligible for noise levels @xmath123 but may surface otherwise . specifically , for a ( gaussian ) noise level of @xmath124 , and a relative line contribution to the band of 10% , both photometric estimators over - estimate @xmath34 by as much as 20% with @xmath68 being more biased than @xmath60 ( fig . [ biases ] ) .",
    "this bias could therefore be present in situations where large and noisy ensembles are considered , or when weak emission lines are targeted . quantifying the bias requires good understanding of the noise properties .",
    "a related bias exists when the noise level in the two bands differs substantially .",
    "more specifically , when @xmath125 ( @xmath126 is the noise level in the @xmath8-/@xmath21- bands ) , our simulations show that @xmath127 may differ from @xmath114 by as much as 25% . whether an over - estimate or an under - estimate of @xmath114 is obtained depends on the particular noise properties , as mentioned above .",
    "observationally , one should therefore aim to work with data having comparable noise levels for the different bands to obtain a bias - free result .",
    "as noted above , for relatively strong lines or low noise levels , such biases are negligible .",
    "varying seeing conditions leading to aperture losses , as well as improperly accounting for stellar variability in the field of the quasar , could lead to correlated errors between the bands .",
    "this in turn could lead to artificial zero - lag peaks in the correlation function of the light curves @xcite , and several solutions have been devised to overcome this problem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . nevertheless , the formalism developed here subtracts off , by construction , the contribution of similar processes ( e.g. , correlated noise ) to both light curves .",
    "in fact , as far as the algorithm is concerned , the continuum contribution to the @xmath21-band is merely an effective correlated noise to be corrected for , which it does .",
    "therefore , photometric reverberation mapping , as proposed here , is considerably less susceptible to the effects of correlated noise than the spectroscopic method .",
    "that being said , if the noise between the bands correlates over sufficiently long ( e.g. , @xmath128day ) timescales , a secure detection of the line - to - continuum time delay may be more challenging ( for an effectively similar case see  3.2.3 ) .",
    "sampling is rarely uniform .",
    "in fact , seasonal gaps could be of the order of the time lag in some objects @xcite .",
    "the full treatment of sampling related issues is beyond the scope of this paper , and we restrict our discussion to light curve gaps ( real data are treated in  4 ) . to check for potential systematics , we resampled our simulated light curves with equal `` on '' and `` off '' observing periods with durations @xmath129 .",
    "we identify a bias when @xmath130 .",
    "nevertheless , both the spectroscopic and the photometric methods are equally affected by it so that their results remain consistent .",
    "as our aim is to focus on cases in which the photometric approach leads to new or different biases , we do not further quantify this bias .",
    "thus far , @xmath131 was assumed . while the spectroscopic method is unaffected by inter - band continuum delays ( the continuum in the immediate vicinity of the emission line is considered )",
    ", our definition of the continuum is that which corresponds to the filter having the least contribution of emission lines to its flux , i.e. , the @xmath8-band .    for a large set of simulation runs ( obtained by varying both @xmath47 and @xmath132 ; not shown ) , we find that biases become non - negligible for @xmath133 ( @xmath134 implies that continuum emission in the @xmath21-band lags behind the @xmath8-band ) . here",
    "we consider particular cases in which @xmath135 ( @xmath136 is assumed ) , and find that @xmath137 results in substantial , @xmath138 bias ( fig .",
    "[ biases ] ) for the following reason : although modest values of @xmath139 are considered , the contribution of continuum processes to both light curves by far exceeds that of the emission line . specifically , when the continuum in the @xmath21-band lags behind the @xmath8-band , the deduced time lag reflects more on @xmath26 than on @xmath34 .",
    "when the @xmath8-band lags behind the @xmath21-band , and @xmath132 is significant , the peak in both statistical estimators is strongly suppressed and time - lag measurements become less reliable .",
    "realistically , inter - band continuum time - delays seem to be of order @xmath140 @xcite , and it is therefore likely that biases of the type discussed here would be negligible for most strong broad emission lines .",
    "realistic quasar spectra could results in more than one emission line contributing to the @xmath21-band , or even different emission lines contributing to both bands . while such complications are irrelevant for the spectroscopic method ( note the small statistical scatter around unity in fig .",
    "[ biases ] ) , the photometric method is only sensitive to the combined contribution of all emission processes in some waveband . here",
    "we study the biases introduced by including the contribution of a weaker secondary emission line to either of the bands whose time lag , @xmath141 .",
    "we find potentially considerable biases when the relative contribution of the weaker line to the flux , @xmath142 satisfies @xmath143 .",
    "however , the magnitude of the bias is also affected by @xmath144 . we do not attempt to fully cover the parameter space in this work , and focus on particular cases . figure [ biases ] shows an example with @xmath145 where we find @xmath146 biases for @xmath147 : when the weaker line contributes to the @xmath21-band , @xmath148 while the opposite occurs when the weaker line contributes to the @xmath8-band . comparing to a case in which @xmath149 and @xmath150",
    ", we find similar trends but an overall smaller ( @xmath151 ) bias .",
    "assuming instead @xmath152 and @xmath150 , we find a bias of order 20% ( 10% ) when the weaker line contributes to the @xmath21- ( @xmath8- ) band . while the magnitude of the bias is clearly not solely determined by @xmath153 , we find that the bias is , generally , small for @xmath154",
    ". clearly , if @xmath155 or @xmath156 then the time - series is insensitive to the presence of the secondary line , and the bias would be negligible regardless of @xmath157 .    further quantifying the bias as a function of the line properties ( e.g. , transfer functions and time - delays ) , filter response functions , quasar redshifts , and",
    "observing patterns is beyond the scope of this paper , and should be carried out on a case by case basis .",
    "it is well known that the ratio of the total duration of the light curve to the time - lag , @xmath158 , needs to be greater than some value to be able to adequately sample the transfer function and reliably measure the time lag using spectroscopic means .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that the same holds also for the photometric method . in particular , for the gaussian ( thick shell ) transfer function",
    ", reliable measurements require that @xmath159",

    "[ biases1 ] ) , the photometrically deduced time lag , @xmath90 , develops a bias with respect to @xmath34 with increasing @xmath158 . generally , the bias is comparable ( but not identical ) for @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and over - estimate the true lag .",
    "we quantify the bias for the two line transfer functions , @xmath161 , defined above (  2.1.2 ) , and find it to be different in each case : broader @xmath161 that extend over larger @xmath75 intervals , lead to more biased results .",
    "for example , while the thick shell blr model shows a factor @xmath162 bias for @xmath163 , the corresponding bias for the gaussian blr is only @xmath164% ( see fig . [ biases1 ] ) .",
    "the bias is seen to grow logarithmically with @xmath165 , and so would be most prominent when analyzing long time - series of low - luminosity quasars .",
    "considering , for example , @xmath166years of lsst data for a low-@xmath0 quasar with a thick shell blr whose size is @xmath101 light - days . in this case ,",
    "@xmath167 , which would result in @xmath168 . not correcting for this bias would lead to an over - estimation of the black hole mass , by a similar factor , with considerable implications for black hole formation and evolution .",
    "consider the bias in @xmath169 : as its value is sensitive to the line transfer function , its origin may be traced to the @xmath170 term in eq .",
    "[ theta ] , which is akin to the bias discussed in @xcite . in a nutshell , with the quasar s power spectrum being red ,",
    "most of the power is associated with the lowest frequency modes",
    ". nevertheless , those are the same modes that are not adequately sampled by any finite time series . as such , the data _ appear _ to originate in a non - stationary process where , for example , the mean flux changes substantially between the extreme ends of the light curve .",
    "this and the fact that emission lines contribution to the flux is always additive results in a positive bias . more extended line transfer functions , resulting in longer term correlations between the light curves , are therefore more prone to such biases . with @xmath171 ,",

    "clearly , both statistical estimators defined here trace the line - to - continuum cross - correlation function with a varying degree of significance : @xmath60 shows a @xmath265 peak ( @xmath259 being the uncertainty around the maximum ) , while the peak in @xmath68 is only @xmath266 significant .    using the monte carlo simulations described in",

    "this results from the non - symmetric nature of @xmath78 showing a more extended wing toward longer time - delays ( fig . [ 0804 ] ) .",
    "results based on the zdcf approach result in errors , which are typically smaller than those obtained using the iccf method .",
    "this results from the fact that the zdcf peak is largely determined by a few individual bins ( note the two bins around 200days that lie above most other zdcf points , as well as above the iccf curve ; fig . [ 0804 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the resulting uncertainty on the zdcf , being of order 20% in this case , is smaller than predicted based on our monte carlo simulations presented in figure [ 1sigma ] .",
    "we conclude that estimating the uncertainty on the time - lag using the zdcf results may be less reliable .    using the iccf time - lag distributions , we determine the observed time - lag for pg0804 to be @xmath267days , which is statistically consistent with the spectroscopically measured value of @xmath268days @xcite . as far as systematics is concerned",

    "in particular , much shorter or much longer time - lags , are inconsistent with our findings in terms of signal amplitude and shape .",
    "interestingly , a weak yet marginally significant hump at around @xmath271days is implied by the data even when much shorter artificial time - lags are used as input",
    ". therefore , one should be careful when interpreting marginally significant signals .",
    "for the specific case considered here we can conclude that the data can not be used to detect short time - lags , which is of no surprise given that the cadence of the light curves is at @xmath272days intervals .",
    "to conclude , the time - lag estimated here by the photometric reverberation mapping approach is @xmath273days , and is therefore consistent with the value deduced by @xcite , albeit with an expectedly larger uncertainty .",
    "this low-@xmath0 , low - luminosity object has a potentially prominent ( @xmath274 ) line contribution to the @xmath240-band from the balmer emission lines . with @xmath275 points in its light curve , and what appears to be significant variations over 200days time scales , our analysis reveals a marginal ( @xmath266 using the fr - rss method and @xmath276 using zdcf statistics ) peak at @xmath277days ( fig .",

    "the spectroscopically measured time - lag for this object is of order 50days and agrees with the value expected from the blr size vs. luminosity relation ( table 1 ) .",

    "in fact , our simulations indicate that only a time - lag @xmath278days , could have been detected with some certainty .",
    "interestingly , simulations with an input lag of 500days (  4.2.2 ) are able to qualitatively account for the observed signal ( dashed magenta curve in figure [ all_pgs ] ) .",
    "it is not clear whether a 500days lag , _ if _ real , is associated with a long - term reverberation signal of the blr , since there is no corresponding signal in the @xcite analysis of the spectroscopic data .",
    "we note , however , that it is also possible that the measurement uncertainties are somewhat under - estimated for this object , hence the significance of our deduced signal over - estimated . that this might be the case",
    "is hinted by the normalized variability measure in both the @xmath239 and @xmath240 bands being similar ( contrary to naive theoretical expectations ) and the fact that contamination by the host galaxy in this low-@xmath0 quasar may be important ( see below ) .",
    "this quasar , being at low redshift ( @xmath279 ) has one of the most prominent ( @xmath280 ) balmer line contributions to the @xmath240-band among the pg objects in our sample .",
    "the analysis detects a significant _ trough _ at @xmath281days , in both statistical estimators , and using both the iccf and the zdcf methods .",

    "simulating cases with time - lags of order 200days also produces a peak , in contrast to the observed signal .",
    "the interpretation that the @xmath239- rather than the @xmath240-band is the line - rich band , is not supported by the optical spectrum showing rather typical quasar emission lines @xcite .",
    "we can not positively identify the origin of the unexpected signal but note that , at its low redshift , and being a rather faint low - luminosity quasar , the host galaxy is likely to substantially contribute to the flux in the bands .",
    "this has a dual result : 1 ) the actual contribution of the emission lines to the bands is smaller than that predicted here , and 2 ) the data may be substantially affected by varying seeing conditions between the nights , thereby contributing to the variance in the light curves , and masking the true signal .",
    "interestingly , the reduced variability measure in both bands is similar for this object , which may indicate the presence of an additional source of noise not accounted for by the reported measurement uncertainties .      analyzing the data for this object ,",
    "a marginally significant signal ( at the @xmath283 level ) is detected in both statistical estimators , at @xmath284days ( fig .",
    "[ all_pgs ] ) .",
    "formally , @xmath60 statistics implies that the time lag is @xmath285days . at its redshift ,",
    "the net contribution of emission lines is of order 5% , and is therefore larger than the typical flux measurement uncertainty in this object ( @xmath286 ) .",
    "simulations with an artificial lag of @xmath287days are able to qualitatively account for the observed signal .",
    "much shorter time lags [ e.g. , @xmath164days , as spectroscopically deduced by @xcite ] do not seem to be supported by our findings .",
    "interestingly , for this object , spectroscopic time - lag measurements using the peak distribution function give very large errors for the h@xmath173 line , and given its luminosity , pg1613 + 658 lies considerably below the blr size vs. luminosity relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also our table 1 ) . using our deduced lag , a better agreement is obtained with the @xcite size - luminosity relation .",
    "this object shows a statistically significant ( @xmath288 ) , wide peak extending over the range 150 - 450days . assuming that h@xmath241 is the main line contributor to the @xmath240 band s flux , our simulations indicate that the signal is consistent with a time - lag of @xmath289days ( formally , @xmath60 statistics yields a @xmath290days lag ) .",
    "this value is statistically consistent with the time - delay measurement of @xcite , but our deduced lag is in somewhat better agreement with the expected blr size given the source luminosity ( table 1 ) .",
    "our simulations show that time - lags considerably shorter ( @xmath291days ) or longer ( @xmath292days ) are less favored by the data and can not fully account for the observed signal ( fig .",
    "[ all_pgs ] ) .",
    "this object , having @xmath164 visits in each band , shows a marginal ( @xmath266 ) hump at 200 - 300days .",
    "formally , the deduced time - lag is @xmath293days , and is consistent with the values of @xcite . at @xmath294 ,",
    "the net contribution of emission lines to the line - rich @xmath240-band is only about twice as large as the mean measurement uncertainty .",
    "this , and the small number of data points , account for the low - significance of the observed signal .",
    "further , simulations show that a marginal signal is indeed expected to occur at roughly the spectroscopically determined lag .",
    "there is a hint for a localized ( @xmath295 ) peak around 200 - 300days in both statistical estimators ( @xmath60 statistics yields a lag of @xmath296days ) using both the iccf and the zdcf methods . at face value , this timescale is consistent with the results of @xcite who find a time lag of @xmath297days .",
    "nevertheless , as discussed by @xcite , the cadence of the @xcite observations may not be adequate to uncover the true time lag in this object .",
    "specifically , @xcite find a time lag of order 30days using better sampled light curves on short time scales .",
    "the fact that we do not find a significant peak on short timescales is not surprising since we are essentially using the @xcite data set .      like pg0804 , pg0026 + 129 ( @xmath298 ) is among the best - sampled quasars in our sample with @xmath299 points per light curve ( see fig . [ 0026 ] ) . while the normalized variability measure is comparable to that of pg0804 , most of the power is associated with long - term variability .",
    "in particular , when subtracting a linear trend from the light curve , the normalized variability measure drops by a factor of @xmath300 in both bands . at its redshift ,",
    "the @xmath240-band is the line - rich ( fig .",
    "[ wise ] ) with a net relative line contribution of @xmath301 due to h@xmath173 ( or @xmath302% if iron is important ) .",
    "the statistical estimators calculated here do not yield a significant time - lag .",
    "specifically , there is no discernible peak detected in either estimator using either cross - correlation method ( i.e. , iccf or zdcf ) . while de - trending seems to somewhat improve the signal ( there is a @xmath303 hump at around 100days ) , it falls short of revealing a significant result .",
    "we attribute our failure to securely identify a signal to a combination of factors related to the smaller variability measure on the relevant blr - size timescales , as well as to the lower net contribution of emission lines to the filters , compared to the case of pg0804 .",
    "pg0052 + 251 has 72 points in each band , and a normalized variability measure of @xmath304 in the @xmath262 bands , partly due to a sharp feature extending over @xmath297days scales .",
    "the typical measurement uncertainty is @xmath305 in both bands . at @xmath306 ,",
    "the net line contribution is of order 4% .",
    "i.e. , comparable to the noise - level . therefore , despite the relatively large number of visits , no clear signal is detected , in either statistical estimator , using either numerical scheme .",
    "the remaining quasars in the @xcite pg sample also do not yield a significant signal .",
    "this is however expected given the small number of points in the photometric light curve of these quasars being @xmath30740 ( see fig .",
    "[ 1sigma ] ) .",
    "the fact that such objects do have a spectroscopically - determined time lag is also not surprising : the photometric approach to reverberation mapping is less sensitive than the spectroscopic one .      to overcome the limitations plaguing the analysis of individual objects , ensemble averages may be considered . as demonstrated in  3 , combining the results for many objects , allows the time - lag to be determined with good accuracy , and was a main motivation on our part to develop this approach to reverberation mapping .",
    "clearly , large ensembles are required to reach a robust result when less than favorable light curves are available on an individual case basis .",
    "nevertheless , with upcoming photometric surveys , statistics is unlikely to be a limiting factor , and defining ensemble averages over narrow luminosity and redshift bins will be possible .    as our small sample of 17 pg quasars consists of a range of redshifts and quasar luminosities , we use the following transformation to put the results for different objects on an equal footing : @xmath308 $ ] , where @xmath309 .",
    "this transformation corrects for both cosmological time - dilation , and the fact that the blr size scales roughly as @xmath310 .",
    "following @xcite , we take @xmath311 but note that similar results are obtained for @xmath312 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "using the above transformation , all pg quasars are effectively transformed to a @xmath313 quasar with @xmath314 .",
    "figure [ pg_mean ] shows the ensemble - averaged results for @xmath78 for the entire pg sample ( table 1 ) .",
    "we deliberately include all objects regardless of data quality issues ( as in the case of e.g. , pg1229 ) .",
    "a peak in both ( mean ) statistical estimators is seen around 200days .",
    "this value is similar to a time - lag of 170days , which is the value predicted by the @xcite blr size - luminosity relation for a @xmath314 quasar .",
    "also plotted are the median results for both statistical estimators .",
    "both the mean and the median provide qualitatively consistent results , although quantitative differences do exist .",
    "given the small nature of the sample , we do not present estimates for the uncertainty on the mean / median values .    to conclude , averaging the results for the pg quasar sample , we obtain a similar peak in both statistical estimators , occurring at times which are qualitatively consistent with the blr sizes implied by the @xcite results .",
    "a larger sample of objects will allow to better quantify the mean time lag for sub - samples of quasars over narrow luminosity and redshift intervals . alternatively , better quality data ( higher s / n , and better sampled light curves ) could be used to better constrain the time - lag for individual objects in the pg sample of quasars .",
    "we demonstrated that line - to - continuum time - delays associated with the broad emission line region in quasars can be deduced from broadband photometric light curves .",
    "this is made possible by defining appropriate statistical estimators [ termed @xmath73 and @xmath72 ] to process the data , and which effectively subtract the continuum contribution to the cross - correlation signal of the light curves . using this formalism ,",
    "the time - lag is identified with the time @xmath75 at which these estimators peak .",
    "the proposed formalism makes use of the fact that line and continuum processes have very different variability properties , and that quasars exhibit large amplitude variations on timescales comparable to the blr light crossing time .",
    "the formalism is generally adequate for cases in which few strong emission lines , having different intensities , contribute to the spectrum , as indeed characterizes the optical emission spectrum of quasars .    to effectively apply the method , prior knowledge of the quasar redshift ( using either photometric or spectroscopic means )",
    "is required to identify relatively line - dominated and line - free spectral bands . together with knowledge of the filter response functions ,",
    "these may be used to better implement the algorithm and interpret the results .",
    "using numerical simulations , we demonstrated that photometric reverberation mapping is feasible under realistic observing conditions and for typical quasar properties .",
    "we showed , by means of numerical simulations and real data ( pertaining to the pg quasar sample ) , that the measurement of the line - to - continuum time - delay is robust although somewhat less accurate than that obtained using the spectroscopic reverberation mapping technique .",
    "in addition , we quantify biases in the photometrically deduced time - lags , which are sensitive to the blr geometry and the duration of the light curve .",
    "we identify their origin and suggest several methods to correct for them .",
    "in addition , we qualitatively study potential biases associated with the presence of multiple emission lines in quasar spectra , and with finite inter - band continuum time - delays .",
    "the main advantage of the photometric approach to reverberation mapping over other methods is that it is _ considerably _ more efficient and cheap to implement , and can therefore be applied to large samples of objects .",
    "in fact , any survey which photometrically monitors the sky with proper cadence and signal - to - noise in two or more filters , and for which quasars may be identified and their redshift estimated , can be used to measure the size of the blr .",
    "we demonstrated that , with large enough samples of quasars , it is possible to beat down the noise , and deduce ( statistical ) blr size measurements that are considerably more accurate than are currently achievable by spectroscopic means .    by combining photometric light curves with single epoch spectroscopic measurements , which allow to estimate the velocity dispersion of the blr , it may be possible to measure the black hole mass in orders of magnitude more objects than are directly measurable by other means",
    ". this would allow for the statistical measurement of the smbh mass for sub - samples of quasars ( selected according to e.g. , their luminosity , redshift , or colors ) , leading to highly accurate results , and potentially revealing differences between different classes of objects , which , thus far , may have eluded detection .    to conclude , photometric surveys that monitor the sky on a regular basis are likely to play a major role in the coming decades in the ( statistical ) measurement of the blr size in quasars , as well as in determining their black hole masses .",
    "this will lead to a more complete census of black holes over cosmic time , and shed light on outstanding problems concerning the formation and co - evolution of black holes and their host galaxies .",
