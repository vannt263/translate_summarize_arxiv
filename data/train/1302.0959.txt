    "<S> gamow - teller ( gt ) strength distributions of mg isotopes are investigated within a framework of the deformed quasi - particle random phase approximation(dqrpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the n=20 shell closure in @xmath0 mg was broken by the prolate shape deformation originating from the _ fp_-intruder states . </S>",
    "<S> the shell closure breaking gives rise to a shift of low - lying gt excited states into high - lying states . </S>",
    "<S> discussions regarding the shell evolution trend of single particle states around n=20 nuclei are also presented with the comparison to other approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of nuclei along the valley of stability is well understood in terms of the conventional magic numbers in the nuclear shell model . in a region far from the stability , experimental studies have shown the breaking of the n=20 magic number in n=20 nuclei , such as @xmath1na , @xmath2 mg , and @xmath3al nuclei located in so called the island of inversion @xcite . the breaking comes from the burrowing of @xmath4 and @xmath5 states below @xmath6 state @xcite , which may originate from the monopole component of the nucleon - nucleon interaction by the tensor force @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the breaking of magic numbers in the inversion island is thought as one of the interesting properties of the exotic nuclei near drip line .    </S>",
    "<S> the neutron - rich nuclei around n=20 are thought to be strongly deformed because of the reduction of the n=20 shell gap . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation in nuclei becomes more important than any other periods with the recent development of rare isotope accelerator facilities , from which one may perform lots of challenging experiments related to the exotic nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> although they decay fractions of a second , their existence is imprinted on the nuclear abundances of stars through the successive nuclear reactions in the cosmos at the explosive stage of stellar evolution , such as supernovae ( sne ) explosion @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , the nuclear reactions induced by the neutrinos emitted from the sne are treated as important input data for the neutrino - process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the neutrinos emitted from a proto - neutron star may have tens of mev energy high enough to excite the deformed nuclei , one needs to understand more precisely the high - lying ( hl ) excited states beyond one nucleon threshold . among them , </S>",
    "<S> the gt states are of great importance because most of the charge exchange reactions are dominated by the gt transition . </S>",
    "<S> these hl gt excited states are in close association with the nuclear structure .    </S>",
    "<S> one of typical instances is the gt quenching problem . </S>",
    "<S> it says that the difference of total running sums @xmath7 for gt ( @xmath8 ) transitions , @xmath9 , is usually quenched compared to the ikeda sum rule ( isr ) , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> but , recent experimental data on hl gt states deduced by more energetic projectiles shed a new light on the gt states located above one nucleon threshold , whose contributions enable us to explain the quenching problem through the multi - particle and multi - hole configuration mixing @xcite .    in order to describe neutron - rich nuclei and their relevant nuclear reactions occurred in the nuclear processes , one needs to develop theoretical frameworks including explicitly the deformation @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the spses adopted from the deformed woods saxon potential naturally depend on the parameter @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation of nuclei may be conjectured to come from macroscopic phenomena , for example , the core polarization , the high spin states and so on . </S>",
    "<S> microscopic reasons may be traced to the tensor force in nucleon - nucleon interaction , which is known to account for the shell evolution according to the recent shell model calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , t = 0 , j = 1 pairing , which is associated with the @xmath40 tensor force , may lead to the deformation compared to the t = 1 , j = 0 pairing . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the deformation parameter adopted in this work may include implicitly and effectively such effects , because the single particle states from the deformed wood saxon potential show strong dependences on the @xmath36 , as shown in figs . 1 and 2 .    </S>",

    "<S> these hl gt states , which were usually not considered because of the limited models space in theoretical side and the limited incident energy of projectiles in experimental side , enable us to abandon the quenching factor for the ikeda sum rule and to take into account of hl gt states in the neutrino - induced reaction , in particular , by the supernova neutrino , whose energy range may extend up to tens of mev @xcite .    in summary , to describe single particle states in deformed basis , we exploited the deformed axially symmetric woods - saxon potential , and performed the deformed bcs and deformed qrpa with the realistic two - body interaction recalculated in deformed basis from _ ab initio _ g - matrix based on bonn cd potential . </S>",
    "<S> results of the gamow - teller strength for mg isotopes show that the deformation effect leads to a fragmentation of the gt strength into hl states and predicts the hl gt excitations to be explored by higher energy projectiles , whose excitations may affect the neutrino process in the cosmos through the gt transition . </S>",

    "<S> the calculations for the neutron - deficient nuclei in the p - process are in progress . </S>",
