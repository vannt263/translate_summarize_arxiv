    "although it is well known that neutrinos are massive by neutrino oscillation experiments  , the values of their masses are still unknown . the answer is never given by oscillation experiments because oscillation probabilities depend on @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we rely on non oscillation experiments such as single beta decay measurements  @xcite , which are direct measurements of neutrino mass , neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath3 ) searches  @xcite and cosmological measurements  @xcite or z - burst interpretation of the highest energy cosmic ray  @xcite .",
    "double beta decay experiments seems to have rather higher sensitivities than those of other non oscillation experiments .",
    "recent results of negative observations of @xmath3 put upper bounds on the observable @xmath7 as @xmath8 by heidelberg - moscow  @xcite and @xmath9 by igex  @xcite .",
    "depend on nuclear matrix elements .",
    "the actual observable is the half - life @xmath10 : @xmath11  y was obtained by heidelberg - moscow , and @xmath12  y by igex . ] the energy regions to be probed can reach to the order of @xmath13 by some of the future experiments [ 11 - 17 ] .",
    "such experiments seem to have strong possibility of @xmath3 observations .",
    "actually , an observation of @xmath3 was announced late last year as @xmath4 with @xmath5 uncertainty of the nuclear matrix elements ( kdhk result  @xcite ; see also comment on the results and the replies  @xcite ) . while this result should be checked in the future experiments , it is fruitful to investigate what kind of information can be extracted from @xmath3 observations .",
    "the constraints imposed on neutrino mixing parameters by @xmath3 experiments have been discussed by many authors ( see the references in  @xcite ) .",
    "the implications of the kdhk result have been also discussed ( see , for example , the references of the second article in  @xcite ) . in this talk , the constraints on a neutrino mass and the solar mixing angle are discussed in the generic three flavor mixing framework by observations ( as well as non - observations ) of @xmath3 .",
    "we use the following standard parametrization of the mns matrix  @xcite : @xmath14 . \\label{mnsmatrix}\\ ] ] the mixing matrix for three majorana neutrinos is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are extra cp - violating phases which are characteristic of majorana particles  @xcite . in this parametrization , the observable of double beta decay experiments",
    "is described as @xmath18 where @xmath19 denote the elements in the first low of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are the neutrino mass eigenvalues . in the convention of this talk",
    ", the normal hierarchy means @xmath23 and the inverted hierarchy @xmath24 .    in order to utilize @xmath25 which is an experimental upper bound on @xmath7",
    ", we derive a theoretical lower bound on @xmath7 .",
    "an appropriate choice of the phase - factor @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) leads to an inequality @xmath27 strictly , the right - hand side ( rhs ) should be the absolute value of it .",
    "it is , however , not necessary to consider the absolute value because @xmath28 has a very small value .",
    "the rhs of ( [ beta2 ] ) is minimized by replacing @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath28 with the largest value @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) which is determined by reactor experiments  @xcite .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath33    next , we derive a theoretical upper bound on @xmath7 to utilize an experimental lower bound @xmath34 .",
    "since the rhs of ( [ beta1 ] ) is maximized by setting the phase - factors unity , we obtain @xmath35 furthermore , @xmath28 is replaced by @xmath31 ( zero ) for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy in order to set the rhs to be the largest value with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "then , the inequality results in @xmath36 for the normal hierarchy , and @xmath37 for the inverted hierarchy .    constraints ( [ beta3 ] ) , ( [ beta5 ] ) and ( [ beta6 ] ) determine an allowed region on the plane of a neutrino mass versus the mixing angle .",
    "in this talk , we use the plane , where @xmath0 denotes the lightest neutrino mass for each hierarchy .",
    ") , ( [ beta5 ] ) and ( [ beta6 ] ) are shown for @xmath38 .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) lines are for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy .",
    "the inside of those bounds are allowed .",
    "the lma region is superimposed with shadow . ]    in this section , we analyze the constraints obtained in the previous section .",
    "two example cases of experimental results are considered below ; the case 1 is @xmath39 which is within the region of the kdhk result , and the case 2 is @xmath40 which is outside of the region of the kdhk result .",
    "the lma solution of the solar neutrino problem , which is only one allowed at  @xcite , is considered mainly .",
    "therefore , the mass square difference are fixed here after as @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the bounds for this case are presented in fig .",
    "[ case1 ] .",
    "it is remarkable that the bounds ( [ beta5 ] ) and ( [ beta6 ] ) , which are obtained with @xmath34 , are almost vertical because of small @xmath43 .",
    "the lines cross the horizontal axis at @xmath44 for not very small @xmath34 ( see the next subsection for very small @xmath34 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 is approximately regarded as the lower bound on @xmath0:@xmath45 .    on the other hand , since there are asymptotes @xmath46 for the bounds",
    "( [ beta3 ] ) , no upper bound on @xmath0 exists for @xmath47 .",
    "the lma solution is fortunately outside of the region .",
    "note that the bounds ( [ beta3 ] ) for the normal and inverted hierarchy are very similar to each other .",
    "it means that the degenerate mass approximation @xmath48 is very good in this case . in this approximation ,",
    "the constraint ( [ beta3 ] ) becomes @xmath49 we see that @xmath50 is a good parameter . in fig .",
    "[ degenerate ] , the bounds ( [ beta3 ] ) are presented on the @xmath51 - @xmath1 plane for @xmath52 .",
    "the similarity between the bounds for two hierarchies means the goodness of the degenerate mass approximation for @xmath53 and also for larger values of @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the same bounds as those in fig .",
    "[ degenerate ] can be used for @xmath54 .",
    "for example , the simple constraint @xmath55 is read off in the figure for the lma best fit value @xmath56 , which corresponds to @xmath57 given by the second article in  @xcite .      )",
    "are shown for @xmath52 .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) lines are for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy .",
    "the inside of those bounds are allowed .",
    "the lma region is superimposed with shadow . ]    the bounds for this case are presented in fig .",
    "[ case2 ] .",
    "it is clear that the degenerate mass approximation is no longer good because the relevant energy scale is smaller than the atmospheric one @xmath58 .",
    "the bounds for the normal and inverted hierarchy differ significantly .",
    "one of the important point is the disappearance of the bound for the inverted hierarchy by ( [ beta6 ] ) .",
    "it means that the constraint ( [ beta6 ] ) is satisfied even for @xmath59 .",
    "it is also possible for the normal hierarchy with smaller @xmath34 .",
    "there are the smallest @xmath34 needed for the existence of the bound by ( [ beta5 ] ) and that by ( [ beta6 ] ) .",
    "the values are extracted approximately from the rhs of ( [ beta5 ] ) and ( [ beta6 ] ) with @xmath60 as @xmath61 for the normal hierarchy , and @xmath62 for the inverted one . in the case 2 , @xmath63 is smaller than 0.053ev , and that is why there is no lower bound on @xmath0 for the inverted hierarchy in fig .",
    "[ case2 ] .    another important point of fig .",
    "[ case2 ] is that the bound ( [ beta3 ] ) for the inverted hierarchy crosses the vertical axis at @xmath64 .",
    "it means that a small @xmath7 excludes large values of @xmath1 for the hierarchy .",
    "conversely , a @xmath1 larger than @xmath65 gives a theoretical minimum of @xmath7@xcite .",
    "finally , let us extract the bound on @xmath0 from the kdhk result . since @xmath66 is large enough , we can use fig .",
    "[ degenerate ] .",
    "therefore , the upper bound on @xmath0 is extracted as @xmath67 for the lma best fit parameters . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath68 is larger than ( [ normal ] ) but smaller than ( [ inverted ] ) . thus , although there is the lower bound on @xmath0 for the normal hierarchy , not for the inverted one .",
    "roughly , @xmath34 is the lower bound on @xmath0 for the normal hierarchy . by combining those results , we obtain @xmath69 for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy with the lma best fit parameters .",
    "if @xmath34 becomes a little larger , @xmath3 observations can give the first exclusion of @xmath59 for both hierarchies .    ) , ( [ beta5 ] ) and ( [ beta6 ] ) are shown for @xmath70 .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) lines are for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy .",
    "the inside of those bounds are allowed .",
    "the lma region is superimposed with shadow . ]",
    "allowed regions on the plane of a neutrino mass versus the solar mixing angle @xmath71 were obtained by using @xmath25 ( @xmath34 ) , which is an experimental upper ( lower ) bound on the observable @xmath7 of double beta decay experiments . for given @xmath71 ,",
    "these become constraints on a neutrino mass such as the lightest mass @xmath0 ; roughly , @xmath72 for the lma best fit parameters .",
    "it became clear that the condition @xmath73 was necessary for the upper bound on @xmath0 to exist .",
    "on the other hand , the condition @xmath74 needs to be satisfied for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy , for the lower bound on @xmath0 to exist .",
    "for example , @xmath4 gives @xmath2 for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy .",
