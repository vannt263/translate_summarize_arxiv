    "( 2012 ) , namely @xmath8 and a specific sfr @xmath25 .",

    "this amounts to 1844 massive @xmath11 sfgs .",
    "subsequent selection criteria serve to optimize the quality of our inferences on resolved h@xmath1 properties , at the expense of compromising the mass completeness of our sfg sample . for our final sample ,",
    "we require galaxies to have secure redshifts , with well - covered h@xmath1 emission detected at the @xmath26 significance level .",
    "we furthermore apply a conservative screening against objects whose grism spectra are contaminated by neighboring sources , as identified based on products of the 3d - hst pipeline , supplemented with a visual inspection . in this step",
    ", we also weed out a small number of sources with prominent residuals over the full wavelength range after subtraction of the continuum model produced by the 3d - hst extraction and fitting pipeline .",
    "finally , we exclude 33 bright x - ray detected objects for which the compact nature of their hst imaging could hint at a significant non - stellar contribution to both the broad - band and the h@xmath1 line emission .",

    "2012 ; trump et al .",
    "in addition , since the h@xmath1 and @xmath29 $ ] emission lines are blended in the wfc3 grism data ( see section  [ halpha_extraction.sec ] ) , the enhanced @xmath29/h\\alpha$ ] ratios of agn - hosting galaxies may push more of them over the signal - to - noise threshold for line emission . in our final sample ,",
    "the only x - ray detected sources remaining are located in goods - south ( 16 ) and goods - north ( 7 ) .",
    "we note that in these deep x - ray fields ( 4 ms and 2 ms exposure , respectively ) , not all x - ray detected sources are necessarily agn .",
    "moreover , no evidence for point source contamination is seen in their hst imaging .",
    "we break down our final sample and the intermediate selection steps by field in table  [ sample.tab ] .",
    "it is important to note that our final sample of 473 massive sfgs spans the entire range in mass and sfr of typical main - sequence galaxies above @xmath30 ( see figure  [ sample.fig ] ) .",

    "the samples are well matched in redshift , mass , star formation activity , obscuration ( @xmath31 ) , axial ratio and size , in terms of dynamic range spanned as well as the distribution within that range . in more detail ,",
    "the h@xmath1 sample shows subtle biases against the lowest ssfr systems , against the most obscured galaxies at a given sfr , and , related , against the most edge - on galaxies .",
    "the similarity between the two samples is encouraging , as it implies that the analysis of the h@xmath1 sample presented in this paper can reveal generic insights for the entire massive sfg population during the transition from the peak of cosmic star formation to the initial phases of its decline .",
    "the three basic steps towards resolved sed modeling are psf matching , pixel binning , and stellar population synthesis modeling of the individual spatial bins .",
    "each of these steps is described in depth by wuyts et al .",
    "briefly , we work at the wfc3 @xmath32 resolution of @xmath33 , and used the iraf psfmatch algorithm to build kernels to bring all shorter wavelength images to the same psf width and shape .",

    "since all galaxies in our sample have spectroscopically confirmed redshifts from the h@xmath1 line detection in the grism data ( and in half of the cases confirmed independently by ground - based spectroscopic campaigns ) , we fix the redshift to its spectroscopically determined value in our sed fitting , hence reducing the number of free parameters by one .",

    "proper extinction corrections are critical for the physical interpretation of dust - sensitive sfr tracers .",
    "this applies to short wavelength ( rest - uv ) broad - band indicators , motivating to a large extent programs such as candels .",
    "while at the longer , rest - optical wavelengths attenuation laws predict a significantly suppressed impact by dust , this may not be the case for the h@xmath1 emission at 6563 , depending on the geometry of dust and stars .",
    "h@xmath1 emission originates from hii regions immediately surrounding young star - forming regions , that are known to be often associated with enhanced levels of obscuring material . as such , the nebular emission emerging near massive o stars that have not yet dispersed or escaped from their dust - rich birth clouds , will be subject to extra extinction with respect to continuum light at the same wavelength that is produced by the bulk of the stars ( no longer embedded in the molecular clouds in which they once formed ) .",
    "the observed ( i.e. , attenuated ) h@xmath1 flux then relates to the intrinsic flux @xmath38 as    @xmath39    where @xmath40 represents the attenuation by diffuse dust in the galaxy and @xmath41 represents the attenuation happening locally in the birth cloud .",
    "the latter have a negligible covering factor and therefore affect no other galaxy light than that emerging from the respective star - forming region itself .",

    "( 1994 ; 2000 ) .",
    "also at larger lookback times , evidence for differential extinction between nebular regions and the bulk of the stars has been mounting , from arguments based on the observed h@xmath1 equivalent widths ( van dokkum et al . 2004 ; frster schreiber et al . 2009 ) , comparisons of multi - wavelength sfr indicators ( wuyts et al . 2011a ; mancini et al .",

    "conceptually , one can think of the diffuse attenuation as being determined by the galaxy s gas fraction , dust - to - gas ratio , large - scale geometry and orientation .",

    "those galaxies that lack ir detections in the candels/3d - hst fields generally suffer less obscuration and are therefore less sensitive to the precise dust correction applied ( although applying a constant @xmath41 , even to sources with @xmath40 near zero , would lead to overestimated h@xmath1 sfrs at the low - sfr end ) .",
    "we now assess the validity of the calibration to correct h@xmath1 for dust extinction ( equation  [ bestfit_dustcor.eq ] ) by considering an independent dust - sensitive diagnostic , namely the h@xmath1/uv luminosity ratio . here",

    "the reason is that the h@xmath1 emission is powered by the ionizing radiation from o stars ( with typical lifetimes of @xmath52 myr ) , while the rest - frame uv light receives its major contributions from both o and b stars ( i.e. , stellar lifetimes up to @xmath53 myr ) .",

    ", we will demonstrate that our prescription for h@xmath1 dust corrections , the associated dependence of h@xmath1/uv ratios on extinction , and in general the above geometrical picture of a two - component dust distribution still holds on the kiloparsec scale resolution of the hst data .",
    "a direct implication of the observed increase in h@xmath1/uv ratios with @xmath49 is the fact that h@xmath1 luminosities are less sensitive to dust than uv luminosities .",

    "before quantitatively analyzing the h@xmath1 properties of our sample of massive @xmath11 sfgs , it is insightful to visually inspect a set of case examples .",
    "figure  [ gallery.fig ] shows a subset of 12 sfgs , illustrating the diversity in size , colors and morphologies represented in the sample . despite their diverse appearance , some key trends that also characterize the sample as a whole can be noted .",
    "first , the central regions of most ( and in particular the larger ) galaxies are more pronounced in the observed @xmath3 than in the @xmath2 band .",
    "this reflects the negative color gradients ( red cores ) found in previous work and more compact stellar mass distributions based thereupon ( e.g. , szomoru et al .",

    "second , the @xmath2-band images appear clumpy or feature spiral signatures more frequently than the rest - optical @xmath3-band images , echoing findings that the clumps / spiral arms are bluer than the underlying disk ( wuyts et al . 2012 ; guo et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "new with respect to these previous studies is that we can now also contrast the h@xmath1 morphologies to the short- and long - wavelength broad - band morphologies .",
    "a visual inspection tells us that overall the h@xmath1 morphologies resemble more closely the @xmath2-band images than the @xmath3-band surface brightness distributions .",
    "both the rest - uv light and h@xmath1 emission are dominated by the youngest stellar populations , unlike the rest - optical emission to which the bulk of the stars ( including older populations ) contribute .",
    "it is however not a trivial observation , because of the different wavelengths probed and dust effects discussed in section  [ halpha_dust.sec ] .",
    "moreover , exceptions exist in which the h@xmath1 morphology does not trace the @xmath2-band light .",
    "for example , the @xmath2-band emission of gn_9129 is entirely dominated by a clump that is not the most prominent h@xmath1 clump in the object . in addition , for the smaller galaxies we are hard - pressed to make a statement on whether the visual morphological match of the h@xmath1 map is closer to @xmath2 than to the @xmath3 band .",
    "galaxies such as gs_22173 just appear compact in all bands considered .",
    "these results are reminiscent of the conclusions drawn by nelson et al .",
    "( 2012 ) on the basis of a sample of 56 equivalent width selected galaxies in 3d - hst .",
    "in order to quantify the above visual impressions , we analyze the morphological match between h@xmath1 and @xmath3 and h@xmath1 and @xmath2 band surface brightness distributions respectively by cross - correlating the images . in doing so , we allow minor shifts of the galaxy centroid before mapping the grism image to the astrometric frame of the candels broad - band images .",
    "this accounts for uncertainties in the position of the grism spectra on the detector and degeneracies between on the one hand the systemic redshift and on the other hand morphological k - corrections between the h@xmath1 line map and the galaxy s f140w light distribution that was used as template in the redshift determination . for each band",

    "this difference is most pronounced among the more extended systems . for galaxies with semi - major axis lengths larger than 3 kpc ( as measured with galfit by van der wel et al .",

    "this fraction increases further to above 90% ( see , e.g. , egs_7021 and cos_16954 in figure  [ gallery.fig ] ) .",

    ", we therefore treat all pixels with @xmath74 as belonging to the inner regions of galaxies , without further regard to their precise value of @xmath75 . in the top panels of figure  [ clump_nature.fig ] ,",
    "we first demonstrate that the conclusions drawn by wuyts et al .",

    "taking one step further away from the direct observables , stellar population synthesis modeling of the multi - wavelength hst colors implies they correspond to sites of enhanced star formation activity ( ssfr ) with respect to the underlying disk .",
    "the h@xmath1 equivalent width can be considered as a complementary , less model - dependent diagnostic of the star formation activity .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the star formation sensitive line emission strength over the continuum flux , which probes the bulk of the stars present in the galaxy . as the emission line and continuum",
    "are measured at the same wavelength , and both components are subject to the attenuating column of diffuse dust in the interstellar medium of the galaxy , extinction effects due to the latter divide out .",
    "we observe the h@xmath1 equivalent width to be higher in the clumps / spiral arm regions ( with a median rest - frame ew@xmath77 ) than in the underlying smooth disk ( ew@xmath78 ) , while the lowest equivalent widths are measured at small radii .",
    "the latter are associated with the regions of highest stellar surface mass density , and are related to the flattening slope of the resolved main sequence at high @xmath68 ( see section  [ resms.sec ] ) .",
    "the implications of the radial trends will be discussed in depth in a forthcoming comprehensive overview of h@xmath1 and star formation profiles as a function of galaxy mass and sfr by e. nelson et al .",
    "( in prep ) . here , we consider in more detail the characteristic trends with surface brightness at a fixed radius . as discussed in section  [ calibrating.sec ] , an additional extinction correction to account for the obscuring material in birth clouds from which the h@xmath1 line emission originates is required for the equivalent width to be an unbiased proxy of the star formation activity . in the bottom right panel of figure  [ clump_nature.fig ] , we apply this correction and find an excess in the clumps intrinsic h@xmath1 equivalent width by 25% in the median with respect to the underlying disk ( i.e. , interclump regions ) at the same galactocentric radii .",
    "we note that the median excess between the equivalent width of clump and disk pixels does not reflect the full dynamic range in rest-2800  surface brightness variations at a given radius and the extent of the associated trend in the h@xmath1 equivalent width .",
    "the reason is that the distribution of disk and especially clump pixels is dominated in numbers by pixels that lie close to the dividing line between the two regimes ( see contours ) .",
    "the color coding in figure  [ clump_nature.fig ] illustrates that excess equivalent widths by factors of 2 to 3 are commonly observed when considering the full range of surface brightness levels observed at a given radius .    in order to address whether the clump and spiral arm regions selected through our methodology differ in other aspects than star formation activity from the diffuse outer disk , we now investigate the relation between the h@xmath1 and rest-2800  luminosity surface densities ( both uncorrected for extinction ; figure  [ hauv_prof.fig ] , top panel ) .",
    "as already hinted at by the similar morphological appearance of our galaxies in h@xmath1 and acs imaging ( section  [ examples.sec ] &  [ crosscor.sec ] ) , the uv and h@xmath1 sfr tracers correlate strongly , both spatially and in amplitude .",
    "their measured luminosity surface densities prior to any dust correction , however , do not follow a relation with a unity slope . instead , the formal best - fit linear relation is @xmath79 ) = 0.2 + 0.8 \\log(\\sigma_{2800}\\ [ l_{\\sun}/kpc^2]).\\ ] ] two potential contributors to the deviation from a unity slope , scatter around the relation , and in more general terms behind variations in h@xmath1/uv luminosity ratios , are dust extinction and variations in the star formation history ( see section  [ halpha_dust.sec ] ) . while both h@xmath1 and uv light are tracing young stellar populations , they probe recent star formation over different timescales ( around 10 myr and 100 myr , respectively ) .",
    "the uv and h@xmath1 radiation are furthermore emitted at different wavelengths and moreover continuum and nebular emission may travel different paths through the galaxies dusty ism .",
    "the combination of these effects leads to systematically larger h@xmath1/uv ratios with increasing extinction compared to the intrinsic ( i.e. , dust - free ) ratio .    evaluating the spatial variation of h@xmath1/uv ratios within our @xmath11 sfgs ( figure  [ hauv_prof.fig ] , bottom panel )",
    ", we find the clumps / spiral features to correspond to lower @xmath51 than the underlying disk at the same radius .",
    "three effects can potentially contribute to this trend .",
    "the first relates to measurement uncertainties , rather than physics .",
    "if the true h@xmath1/uv ratio were constant across galaxies , measurement errors would preferentially push those spatial bins over the clump selection threshold for which @xmath80 is overestimated . since the 2800  luminosity appears in the denominator , the measured h@xmath1/uv ratio for those bins",
    "would consequently be lower than the true value .",
    "while possibly contributing in a minor way , this effect is unlikely to be by itself responsible for the observed trend , given the small uncertainty on @xmath80 ( see appendix ) and the fact that the clumps are also confirmed to be physically distinct from the underlying disk in quantities that are measured independently of the 2800  luminosity ( e.g. , the h@xmath1 equivalent width ) .",
    "a more physical interpretation is that the excess surface brightness regions selected from rest - uv acs imaging are not only regions characterized by enhanced star formation , but preferentially those local enhancements in star formation that are the least obscured .",
    "speculatively , outflows driven by the enhanced star formation density in clumps ( see , e.g. , newman et al . 2012 ) may be responsible for the clearing of gas and dust towards these sightlines .",
    "finally , we can not exclude that recent variations in the star formation history contribute to the lower h@xmath1/uv ratios of clumps as well .",
    "we note , however , that a recent upturn of the sfr in spatial bins that are classified as clumps or spiral features would lead to elevated h@xmath1/uv ratios ( i.e. , relatively more o stars compared to the number of b stars ) , the opposite of what is observed . interpreting the h@xmath1/uv ratios in terms of changes in the star formation history would therefore invoke a rapidly declining star formation rate ( see figure  [ hauv_int.fig ] ) , and consequently a prior ( possibly very short - lived ) phase of even more intense star formation .",
    "the latter phase necessarily would have to be embedded , since otherwise it would itself be picked up by the uv clump selection .",
    "as such , both physical explanations could go hand in hand , in a scenario where outflows quickly clear the gas and dust from clumps , simultaneously reducing their star formation activity and obscuration , and consequently lowering the observed h@xmath1/uv ratio .",
    "if true , this would imply that resolved observations at longer wavelengths with alma or pdbi / noema may reveal new / different clumps that correspond to an earlier , embedded evolutionary stage of star - forming regions .",
    "while the analysis in section  [ clump_nature.sec ] sheds light on how star formation activity ( ssfr or ew ) varies depending on the location within galaxies , it does not reveal how much of the star formation rate integrated over all galaxies is contributed by the center , clump , and disk regimes respectively .",
    "figure  [ clump_budget.fig ] serves to address this question .",
    "we first consider the integrated h@xmath1 luminosity of all galaxies in the sample , irrespective of whether they have spatial bins in the clump regime or not . with 8.3%/79.1%/12.6% of the integrated h@xmath1 luminosity budget being contributed by the central / disk / clump regions ( as defined by eq .",
    "[ center.eq]-[clump.eq ] ) , it is clear that the vast majority of the h@xmath1 emission arises from the disk component .",
    "line emission ( see section  [ halpha_extraction.sec ] ) , to avoid a biased weighting of different radial bins . ] a similar conclusion can be drawn from the breakdown of the rest - frame 2800  luminosity budget , with modest differences that can be understood from the trends described in section  [ clump_nature.sec ] and specifically figure  [ hauv_prof.fig ] .",
    "the clump pixels account for 18% of the integrated @xmath64 luminosity .",
    "it should be noted that the precise percentages quoted above depend significantly on the adopted dividing lines between the regions ( eq .",
    "[ center.eq]-[clump.eq ] ) , and the fractional contribution of excess surface brightness regions should be regarded as coming from bright clumps and spiral features that show sufficient contrast with respect to the extended smooth disk to be detected at the kiloparsec resolution of wfc3 .",
    "for example , if we were to lower the dividing line between the disk and clump regions by 0.2 dex , bringing it close to the peak of the contours in figure 10 , the fractional contribution of clumps in this adjusted definition would be 30% to the h@xmath1 luminosity and 23% to the h@xmath1 derived sfr .",
    "the latter percentages can be interpreted as a rough estimate of the upper limit on the fractional contribution by uv bright clumps .    as discussed extensively in section  [ calibrating.sec ] , the h@xmath1 luminosity is not a direct tracer of the total on - going star formation , since part of the ionized gas emission is filtered out by the intervening obscuring material . as discussed by wuyts et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , sfgs feature radial gradients in dust extinction .",
    "this results in an enhanced contribution of the inner ( @xmath74 ) regions of the galaxies to the integrated sfr budget of our sample : 12.9% when computing the budget based on dust corrected h@xmath1 emission .",
    "a similar contribution of 14.8% is obtained from broad - band sed modeling .",

    "( 2012 ) found similar fractional contributions for their mass - complete sample of @xmath11 sfgs , confirming that our h@xmath1 sample is not subject to significant biases in this regard . using broad - band hst imaging , wuyts et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also extended the analysis to @xmath82 , finding that the fractional contribution of clumps to the integrated sfr of sfgs increases to @xmath83 at @xmath10 .",

    "our findings fit in the context of a two - component geometrical dust model , in which the ionized gas emission surrounding young star - forming regions is obscured by dust from the birth cloud itself in addition to the column of diffuse material spread throughout the galaxy that also affects the bulk of galaxy light emitted by older stars ( see also charlot & fall 2000 ; wild et al .",

    ", we confirmed that this prescription for extra extinction towards hii regions reproduces the relation between the observed h@xmath1/uv luminosity ratio and the effective visual extinction inferred from broad - band sed modeling .",
    "the fact that the observed h@xmath1/uv luminosity ratio rises with increasing visual extinction directly implies that h@xmath1 is a less dust - sensitive sfr tracer than uv emission .",
    "@xmath86 the h@xmath1 and rest - frame 2800  luminosities correlate on a pixel - by - pixel basis , and after proper dust corrections are applied , the sfr estimates based thereupon are internally consistent .",
    "the h@xmath1/uv luminosity ratios of individual spatial bins also relate to the visual extinction inferred from multi - band hst photometry in a manner that is consistent with the applied correction for extra extinction towards the hii regions .",
    "@xmath86 we find evidence for the existence of a resolved main sequence of star formation : the rate of ongoing star formation per unit area tracks the amount of stellar mass assembled over the same area .",
    "its near - linear slope is consistent with the one measured for the galaxy - integrated main sequence , including an apparent flattening at the high - mass density end , associated with the low - ew inner regions of the most massive galaxies .",
    "@xmath86 off - center clumps ( or spiral features that show up similarly as regions with excess surface brightness ) are characterized by enhanced h@xmath1 equivalent widths , bluer broad - band colors and correspondingly higher specific sfrs than the underlying disk , implying they are a star formation phenomenon .",
    "physically , they may correspond to regions with elevated gas fractions and/or star formation efficiencies ( tacconi et al .",
    "2013 ) , where part of the global gas disk collapsed through gravitational instabilities ( see , e.g. , bournaud et al .",
    "2008 ; genzel et al .",
    "2008 ; dekel et al .",
    "2009 ) , although at @xmath11 secular processes on longer timescales , such as spiral density waves , are also likely to contribute . in an integrated sense , however , the contribution of excess surface brightness regions to the total amount of star formation taking place within @xmath11 sfgs is limited to 10 - 15% , depending on the tracer .",
    "most stars being formed between @xmath87 and @xmath88 are formed in the disk component ( see also frster schreiber et al .",

    "( 2012 ) demonstrated this conclusion holds out to @xmath10 , where the fraction of total star formation in off - center clumps increases , but does not exceed @xmath83 .    @xmath86 aside from spatial fluctuations in the star formation activity , an inhomogeneous dust distribution can lead to spatial mass - to - light ratio variations , and consequently a range in surface brightness levels at a given radius , even for smooth stellar mass distributions .",
    "the visual extinction gradient inferred from broad - band sed modeling is to first order radial .",
    "we furthermore find clumps / spiral features selected from acs imaging to exhibit lower h@xmath1/uv luminosity ratios than the underlying disk .",

    "2012 ; szomoru et al .",

    ", we demonstrated that a more complete census of the distribution of baryons within distant galaxies , including the ionized gas as traced by h@xmath1 ( see also nelson et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ) , helps to constrain spatial variations in star formation activity and dust extinction . despite the significant strides forward , especially through the synergy between the candels and 3d - hst legacy programs , a significant fraction of the total baryonic mass budget remains missing from these resolved studies .    in a galaxy - integrated sense , the phibss survey carried out with the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) revealed that cold molecular gas traced by co accounts for a third of the baryonic mass within @xmath6 sfgs , with molecular gas mass fractions increasing further out to higher redshifts ( tacconi et al .",
    "2010 , 2013 ; see also daddi et al .",
    "knowing how the molecular gas is distributed within galaxies is crucial to interpret the continuing growth of structure : by quantifying the star formation efficiency in the central , outer disk , and clump / spiral arm regimes separately , identifying the regions with enhanced columns of obscuring material , and finally contrasting the total ( gas + stellar ) baryonic mass profiles to the available constraints on enclosed mass from kinematics .    exploiting the first resolved data set of a distant galaxy consisting of 3d co and h@xmath1 data cubes as well as multi - band hst imaging , genzel et al .",
    "( 2013 ) demonstrates the power of such a synergy .",
    "these authors find a correlation between the column of co line emission and the visual extinction inferred from the hst colors , a near - linear resolved kennicutt - schmidt relation , and consistent kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas components .",
    "the superior sensitivity provided by alma and the noema extension to pdbi promises to advance this field even further , through mapping systematically the spatial variations in co line emission as well as the dust - sensitive mm continuum for galaxies spanning a wide dynamic range along and across the main sequence of star formation .",

    "support for program number hst - go-12060 and hst - go-12177 was provided by nasa through a grant from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
    "as described in section  [ candels.sec ] , the available high - resolution hst imagery in the candels/3d - hst fields varies from 7-band @xmath90 photometry in the goods fields , contributing 46% of our sample , to a more modest sampling of the sed , in @xmath91 , for egs , uds and cosmos ( objects with less coverage were excluded from the sample ) .",
    "our choice to include also the latter three fields in the analysis is therefore necessarily a trade - off between having the richest possible set of information per object , and maximizing the sample statistics .",
    "we verify the validity of our approach in two ways .",
    "first , we repeat our entire analysis five times , each time using the data set of an individual field separately .",
    "we revisit the relation between h@xmath1- and broad - band derived properties ( section  [ broad_vs_line.sec ] ) , the variation of stellar population properties across the co - added rest - uv surface brightness profiles ( section  [ clump_nature.sec ] ) , as well as the fractional contributions to the h@xmath1 luminosity and integrated sfr by the central / disk / clump regions ( section  [ contrib.sec ] ) . doing so , we confirm that the same generic behavior is seen in each of the fields separately , albeit naturally based on smaller number statistics .",
    "this test boosts our confidence that the conclusions drawn in this paper are not driven by just a limited subset of the objects entering our analysis .",
    "for example , the relative fractional contributions of galaxy centers , disks , and clumps or spiral arms , vary by at most a few percent between fields .",
    "second , we tested the impact of having 4 rather than 7 flux points per spatial bin , by repeating the analysis for the goods - south field using only the @xmath92 resolved photometry .",
    "we found that the best convergence between solutions of 4- and 7-band fitting is obtained when assigning a weight @xmath93 to each grid cell and marginalizing over the multi - dimensional parameter space explored in the fitting process ( see salim et al .",
    "2007 for an extensive discussion ) .",
    "we therefore chose to follow this approach throughout the paper , but note that consistent conclusions are reached when using the minimum @xmath94 value . comparing the 4- to 7-band fitting , we reproduce the overall lessons learned on resolved star formation patterns at @xmath11 presented in this paper : the existence of a resolved main sequence of star formation with similar slope as the galaxy - integrated version , and excursions from this relation in the form of off - center regions with excess star formation , or low equivalent width regions in galaxy centers .",
    "quantitatively , the stellar surface mass density , rest - frame 2800  surface brightness , and rest - frame @xmath95 color are least affected by the transition from 7 to 4 bands , inducing less than 0.07 dex scatter and no systematic offsets .",
    "the absence of systematics is most crucial , as throughout the paper we never treat individual spatial bins separately , but instead always consider statistics averaged over large numbers of spatial bins taken from all objects in the sample .",
    "unsurprisingly , the inferred age , sfr , and visual extinction are less well constrained by 4-band seds , with scatter in the 4- to 7-band comparison of 0.18 dex , 0.20 dex and 0.32 mag respectively , and strong ( anti-)correlations between the offsets . however , also for these parameters we measure only minor systematic offsets , with amplitudes that are a factor 6 smaller than the observed scatter .",
    "this propagates to variations in the co - added surface brightness profiles and resolved main sequence of comparable or even smaller amplitude than the variations seen from field to field .",
    "we conclude that , to the level of detail presented in this paper , the above tests support the robustness of our results .",
    "however , in order to push the study of resolved stellar populations at high redshift further , toward extensive analyses on a per object basis , additional means to better disentangle age and dust effects would be desirable .",
    "two possible avenues are the inclusion of wfc3 uvis data ( teplitz et al .",
    "2013 ) , providing access to resolved maps of the uv slope @xmath96 , and the upcoming jwst / nircam mission , which will enable the application of the uvj diagnostic technique ( wuyts et al .",

    "<S> we analyze the resolved stellar populations of 473 massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 , with multi - wavelength broad - band imaging from candels and h@xmath1 surface brightness profiles at the same kiloparsec resolution from 3d - hst . </S>",
    "<S> together , this unique data set sheds light on how the assembled stellar mass is distributed within galaxies , and where new stars are being formed . </S>",
    "<S> we find the h@xmath1 morphologies to resemble more closely those observed in the acs @xmath2 band than in the wfc3 @xmath3 band , especially for the larger systems . </S>",
    "<S> we next derive a novel prescription for h@xmath1 dust corrections , which accounts for extra extinction towards hii regions . </S>",
    "<S> the prescription leads to consistent sfr estimates and reproduces the observed relation between the h@xmath1/uv luminosity ratio and visual extinction , both on a pixel - by - pixel and on a galaxy - integrated level . </S>",
    "<S> we find the surface density of star formation to correlate with the surface density of assembled stellar mass for spatially resolved regions within galaxies , akin to the so - called main sequence of star formation established on a galaxy - integrated level . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from this relation towards lower equivalent widths are found in the inner regions of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> clumps and spiral features , on the other hand , are associated with enhanced h@xmath1 equivalent widths , bluer colors , and higher specific star formation rates compared to the underlying disk . </S>",
    "<S> their h@xmath1/uv luminosity ratio is lower than that of the underlying disk , suggesting the acs clump selection preferentially picks up those regions of elevated star formation activity that are the least obscured by dust . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis emphasizes that monochromatic studies of galaxy structure can be severely limited by mass - to - light ratio variations due to dust and spatially inhomogeneous star formation histories . </S>"
