    "the paper concerns with parabolic equations containing discontinuos hysteresis operator on the right - hand side . for simplicity we restrict our consideration to the most basic discontinuous hysteresis operator - the so - called non - ideal relay .    if the input function @xmath2 is less than a lower treshold @xmath3 , then the output @xmath4 $ ] of the non - ideal relay is equal @xmath5 .",
    "while @xmath2 increasing , the output remains equal @xmath5 until the input reaches an upper treshold @xmath6 - at this moment the output switches from @xmath5 to @xmath7 .",
    "further increasing of @xmath2 does not change the output state .",
    "observe that @xmath4 $ ] switches back to the state @xmath5 when the input @xmath2 afterwards decreases to @xmath8 .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in figure  [ fig_1 ] .",
    "it is evident that the non - ideal relay operator takes the path of a rectangular loop and its next state depends on its past state .",
    "examples of parabolic equations with non - ideal relay arise in various biological , technological and chemical processes ( see , for instance , @xcite , and references therein ) .",

    "recall that @xmath47 is the anisotropic sobolev space with the norm @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the norm in @xmath50 with @xmath51 .    since the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ main - equation ] ) is a discontinuous function depending on @xmath2 , the location of interfaces between regions where @xmath4 $ ] takes the values @xmath52 and @xmath5 is a priori unknown . they can be treated as the free boundaries .",
    "a first attempt to create a mathematical theory of hysteresis was made in monograph @xcite where problems with odes were studied .",
    "we mention also the fundamental books @xcite in which various hysteretic effects in spatial - distributed systems are described .",
    "the problem ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] ) was introduced in @xcite where the growth of a colony of bacteria ( salmonella typhimurium ) on a petri dish was modelled .",
    "the papers @xcite were devoted to numerical analysis of the problem , however without rigorous justification .    first existence results for solutions of problems like ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] ) were proved in @xcite for modified multi - valued versions of hysteresis operator .",
    "the main reason for these operator extensions was the observation that the discontinuous hysteresis operator @xmath4 $ ] is not closed with respect to topologies appropriate to its coupling with pdes .    in paper @xcite , problem ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] )",
    "was studied in the one-(space)-dimensional case under the assumption that on the level sets @xmath53 and @xmath54 the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ main - equation ] ) allows to take any value from the whole interval @xmath55 $ ] . the global existence in a specially defined class of weak solutions",
    "were established there .",
    "in addition , the nonuniqueness and nonstability of such weak solutions were discussed in @xcite in several examples .",
    "the multi-(space)-dimensional case with the non - ideal relay replaced by the so - called completed relay was treated in @xcite where the global existence result was established for weak solutions .",

    "in particular , @xmath56 $ ] admits any value from the whole interval @xmath55 $ ] on the set @xmath57 ( see figure  [ fig_2 ] ) . for further details concerning the properties of @xmath56",
    "$ ] we refer the reader to @xcite as well as to chapter iv of @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that for @xmath44 the problem ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] ) with @xmath56 $ ] on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ main - equation ] ) is , in fact , the two - phase parabolic free boundary problem .",
    "the properties of solutions of this two - phase problem as well as the behaviour of the corresponding free boundary were completely studied in @xcite .",
    "due to directional restrictions on jumps of the hysteresis on the tresholds @xmath8 and @xmath22 , problem ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] ) with @xmath23 can not be reduced to the two - phase parabolic problem even for modified versions of the hysteresis operator .",
    "another way to overcome the troubles generated by discontinuity of the hysteresis operator has been proposed in papers @xcite where a _ special class _ of strong solutions of ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] ) satisfying the additional _ transversality property _ was introduced in the one-(space)-dimensional case .",
    "this transversality property roughly speaking means that the solution @xmath2 has a nonvanishing spatial gradient on the free boundary .",
    "more precisely , in the case @xmath58 the transversal solutions are defined as follows .",
    "[ def - transversal ] a function @xmath2 is called a _",

    "a theorem on the uniqueness of strong transversal solutions was established in @xcite .",
    "the local well - posedness of the problem ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] ) in the multi-(space)-dimensional case is still an open question .",
    "recently , the approaches developed in the theory of free boundary problems have been applied to the study of strong solutions .",
    "such an activity was initiated in paper @xcite where the local regularity properties of the strong solutions of ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] ) , i.e. , solutions from the sobolev space @xmath0 with suffiently large @xmath1 , were studied in the multi-(space)-dimensional case . without assuming the transversality property it was proved in @xcite that outside some `` pathalogical '' part of the free boundary we have the optimal regularity @xmath66 .",
    "if the reader is not familiar with free boundary problems , we recommend him to consult the book @xcite where the main concepts and developed methods are discussed for several model problems .    in the rest of the paper we describe in more detail the properties of the strong solutions of ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] ) as well as of the free boundaries that are known for today .",
    "sections  2 and 3 are devoted to the general multi-(space)-dimensional case where we do not assume the transversality property .",
    "conversely , section  4 deals with the transversal solutions in one-(space)-dimensional case .",
    "the results listed in sections  2 - 3 were established in @xcite , while in section  4 we announce the results from @xcite .",
    "we denote @xmath68(z)=\\pm 1\\right\\rbrace , \\\\ \\gamma ( u)&=\\partial\\omega_+ \\cap \\partial\\omega_- \\ \\text{is the free boundary}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the latter means that @xmath69 is the set where the function @xmath4(z)$ ] has a jump .",
    "note that @xmath70 may consist of several components @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "in other words , @xmath72    we also introduce special notation for some parts of @xmath73 @xmath74 by definition , @xmath75    due to definition  [ def - strong - solutions ] it is easy to see that the @xmath76-dimensional lebesgue measure of the sets @xmath53 and @xmath54 equals zero .",
    "in addition , the sets @xmath53 and @xmath54 are separated from each other . moreover , for any @xmath77 the distance from the level set @xmath78 to the level set @xmath54 in the cylinder @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 is estimated from below by a positive constant @xmath82 depending on @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 only .",
    "observe that the level sets @xmath78 and @xmath54 are not alsways the parts of the free boundary @xmath73 . indeed , if the level set @xmath78 is locally not a @xmath86-graph , then a part of @xmath53 may occur inside @xmath87 . in this case",
    "@xmath73 may contain several components of @xmath88 connected by cylindrical surfaces with generatrixes parallel to @xmath86-axis .",
    "similar statement is true for the level set @xmath89 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath90 the set of all points @xmath91 lying in such vertical parts of @xmath73 .",
    "some examples of eventual connections of @xmath92 with @xmath88 and @xmath93 are shown on figure  [ fig_3 ] .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     recall that by definition of @xmath94 the function @xmath4 $ ] has a jump in @xmath86-direction from @xmath52 to @xmath5 there .",
    "the latter means that if we cross the free boundary @xmath95 in positive @xmath86-direction then the corresponding phases change from @xmath96 to @xmath87 ( see figure  [ fig_3 ] again ) .",
    "the similar statement can be made for the neighborhood of @xmath97 , that is if we cross the free boundary @xmath98 in positive @xmath86-direction then the phases will change from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath101    it should be noted that this @xmath92 is just the `` pathalogical '' part of the free boundary mentioned in introduction .",
    "indeed , we have no information about the values of @xmath2 on @xmath92 , since @xmath92 is , in general , not the level set @xmath53 as well as not the level set @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , for any direction @xmath102 functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 are , in general , not sub - caloric near @xmath92 .",
    "the latter fact causes the serious difficulties in studying the regularity properties of solutions .",
    "we will also distinguish the following parts of @xmath105 : @xmath106 the sets @xmath107 and @xmath108 are defined analogously .",
    "in addition , we set @xmath109    using the von mises transformation combined with the parabolic theory and the implicit function theorem it is possible to show that @xmath110 is locally a @xmath111-surface .",
    "in this section we discuss the _ local _ regularity properties of a strong solution @xmath2 of ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] ) .    for simplicity of notation we will denote by @xmath113 a majorant of @xmath114 and",
    "will highlight below the dependence of all obtained estimates on @xmath113 .",
    "recall that the general parabolic theory ( see , e.g. @xcite ) provides for any @xmath115 the estimates @xmath116 where @xmath117 , @xmath80 and @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath2 and its spatial gradient @xmath119 are hlder continuous in @xmath11 , and @xmath120 in the interior of the sets @xmath70 , as well .",
    "we note also that if @xmath16 as well as the values of @xmath2 on the parabolic boundary of @xmath11 are smooth then the corresponding estimates of @xmath121-norm for @xmath122 and @xmath123 are true in the whole cylinder @xmath11 .",
    "contrariwise , @xmath124 has a jump across the free boundary @xmath73 .",
    "thus , @xmath125 is the best possible regularity of solutions . the optimal ( i.e. , @xmath126 ) regularity is not obvious .",
    "a crucial point here is the quadratic growth estimate of the type @xmath127 with @xmath128 . here",
    "@xmath129 denotes the parabolic distance from @xmath130 to @xmath92 , while @xmath131 stands for the parabolic distance from @xmath130 to @xmath132 and @xmath133    the parabolic distance @xmath134 from a point @xmath135 to a set @xmath136 is defined as @xmath137    to show quadratic bound ( [ quadratic - growth - u ] ) we argue by a contradiction and combine this with a local rescaled version of the famous caffarelli monotonicity formula .",
    "more detailed information about caffarelli s monotonicity formula and its local rescaled version can be found in book @xcite and in papers @xcite , respectively .",
    "further , it can be verified that quadratic growth estimate ( [ quadratic - growth - u ] ) implies the corresponding linear bound for @xmath138 @xmath139 with @xmath140 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath141 on the distance @xmath129 in ( [ quadratic - growth - u])-([linear - growth - du ] ) arises due to the monotonicity formula .",
    "unfortunately , near @xmath92 neither the local rescaled version of caffarelli s monotonicity formula nor its generalisation such as the almost monotonicity formula introduced in @xcite are applicable to positive and negative parts of the space directional derivatives @xmath142 .",
    "besides estimates ( [ quadratic - growth - u])-([linear - growth - du ] ) , the information about behaviour of @xmath143 near @xmath144 plays an important role .",
    "as already mentioned above , @xmath122 may has jumps across the free boundary .",
    "actually , one can show that @xmath122 is a continuous function in a neighborhood of @xmath145 .",
    "in addition , the monotonicity of jumps of @xmath4 $ ] in @xmath86-direction provides the one - sided estimates of the time derivative of @xmath2 near @xmath73 .",
    "more precisely , the estimate of @xmath122 from below holds true near @xmath94 , whereas the estimate of @xmath143 from above holds true near @xmath97 .",
    "combination of these results with the observation that @xmath146 on @xmath147 and @xmath148 on @xmath149 leads to an absolute estimate of the time - derivative of @xmath2 on the set @xmath150 .",
    "namely , @xmath151 where the constant @xmath152 , contrary to @xmath141 , depends only on given quantities .",
    "in addition , we can show that the mixed second derivatives @xmath153 are @xmath154-functions in @xmath155 .",
    "now , estimates ( [ quadratic - growth - u])-([time - derivative - estimate ] ) allow us to apply the methods from the theory of free boundary problems and estimate @xmath156 and @xmath157 for any @xmath91 being a point of smothness for @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main result is formulated as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 be a solution of eq .",
    "[ main - equation ] , and let @xmath158 . then @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "we emphasize that the constant @xmath161 in ( [ optimal - regularity ] ) does not depend on the parabolic distance from @xmath91 to @xmath162 as well as to @xmath163 .",
    "unfortunately , we can not remove the dependence of @xmath161 on @xmath129 , i.e. on the parabolic distance of @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "for one-(space)-dimensional transversal solutions of ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] ) the results of sections 2 and 3 can be strengthened .    as in the papers @xcite we will suppose that initially there are only finite number of different components @xmath71 .",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath58 the `` pathalogical '' part of the free boundary @xmath92 is a union of vertical segments parallel to @xmath86-axis .",
    "further , according to definition  [ def - transversal ] we conclude that for transversal solutions @xmath2 the inequality @xmath164 holds true on @xmath165 .",
    "however , on @xmath92 the function @xmath166 may vanish even for transversal solutions .",
    "in addition , the time - derivative @xmath122 is continuous across @xmath92 except eventually the end points of the vertical segments .",
    "thus , for transversal solutions we have @xmath167 , and , consequently , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "the transversality property of a solution @xmath2 implies the monotone behaviour of the free boundary @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , it is possible to show that the set @xmath170 is locally either a subgraph of a monotone curve or a subgraph of a union of two monotone curves with different character of monotonicity .",
    "these monotone curves include the parts of @xmath94 and also may contain vertical segments .",
    "an example of a possible union of two monotone curves is provided on figure  [ fig_4 ] .    , width=384 ]    similar statement is true for the set @xmath171 near @xmath172 .",
    "so , @xmath171 is locally either a subgraph of a monotone curve or a subgraph of a union of two monotone curves with different character of monotonicity .    finally , under the additional assumption that on a time - interval @xmath173 the free boundary part @xmath92 consists of at most finite number of vertical segments , it is possible to prove the optimal regularity result up to @xmath92 .",
    "in other words , one can establish that for any @xmath174 being a point of smoothness for transversal solutions @xmath2 the constant @xmath161 from ( [ optimal - regularity ] ) is independent on the parabolic distance from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "the detailed explanation of all results presented in this section can be found in  @xcite .",
    "below we discuss several open problems and areas of further work .",
    "it should be emphasized that quadratic growth estimate ( [ quadratic - growth - u ] ) allows to apply the standard parabolic scaling in points @xmath175 and to obtain the corresponding blow - up limits  of  @xmath2 . using a version of parabolic weiss s monotonicity formula",
    "it can be shown that all blow - ups are homogeneous functions .",
    "classification of all possible blow - up limits and further studying the regularity of the free boundary @xmath176 are open problems . for @xmath58 some preliminary results of this kind are established in @xcite .",
    "the original version of parabolic weiss s monotonicity formula can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 satisfy on @xmath177 the inequalities @xmath178 . in this case even for weak solutions",
    "we have the same inequalities @xmath178 a.e . in @xmath11 .",
    "we suppose that strong solutions of ( [ main - equation])-([initial - hysteresis ] ) do not exist in this case .",
    "note that numerical examples given in presentation @xcite suggest the possible non - existence of the strong solutions with nontransveral initial conditions .",
    "confirmation or rejection of this hypothesis is an open question even for the one-(space)-dimensional case .",
    "another challenging problem is to define the transversality property for strong multi-(space)-dimensional solutions .",
    "some results in this direction were obtained very recently in @xcite .",
    "the last ( but not least ) hypothesis concerns the regularity of the free boundary in the nontransversal case @xmath58 .",
    "it is proposed to prove or disprove the assertion that the free boundary @xmath69 is smooth except the end - points of the vertical segments provided @xmath92 consists of at most finite number of such segments .",
