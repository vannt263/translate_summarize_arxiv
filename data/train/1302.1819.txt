    "we see , that having a situation proposed in this article it is not always true the assumption that dark energy could be the source of the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "at least , for some values of the parameters of the model we observe that the mixture behaves as a dark energy with negative eos parameter , while @xmath45 .",
    "for some cases we saw that dark energy really is responsible for accelerated expansion with @xmath46 .",
    "almost the same result we obtain considering a modified fluid not described by the energy density of our consideration , but as a fluid described as @xmath47 . which corresponds to a cosmological constant model with @xmath48 .",
    "here we have following possibilities , first that the modification of a fluid of our consideration could not work with van der waals gas , or probably an interaction of the consideration between components is not realistic and other modification should be done with interaction term .",

    "<S> we consider a model of a universe with ghost dark energy and van der waals fluid interacting with a fluid which was born as a result of interaction between original fluid and some other fluid existing in universe . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that ghost dark energy has its contribution to the model by an interaction term @xmath0 and we suppose that @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    we consider a universe composed of van der waals fluid @xcite , @xcite @xmath2 interacting with a modified fluid model @xcite @xmath3 @xmath4.\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a scale factor , @xmath6 is an interaction coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of such fluid can be supposed to be an interaction or different types of interactions between an original fluid and other fluids in universe , which are coded in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> generally the origin of this fluid can be anything , but here we will not make assumption and will consider the universe in the presence of this fluid . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider an interaction between last two fluids and we will suppose the presence of a ghost dark energy @xcite , @xcite with energy density given as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hubble parameter . </S>",
    "<S> concerning to this component we assume that ghost dark energy with ( [ eq : ghost ] ) will appear and play a role only in interaction term . </S>",
    "<S> dark energy was born in gr to explain experimental data claiming , that the expansion of the universe is accelerated . </S>",
    "<S> dark energy with dark matter are exotic and mysterious components of the universe , capturing a lot of attention and not to be explained still . </S>",
    "<S> generally , it is accepted that dark energy should be described by negative pressure and positive energy density , therefore implying negative eos parameter @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest model is a cosmological constant @xmath10 introduced by einstein , but it suffers with the problem known as cosmological coincidence problem asking why are we living in an epoch in which the densities of dark energy and matter are comparable ? one of the ways to solve the cosmological coincidence problem is to consider the interaction between the components on phenomenological level . </S>",
    "<S> generally , interaction could be considered as a function of energy densities and their derivatives : @xmath11 . to make everything working with units , we only should consider the fact that unit of interaction term @xmath12=\\frac{[energy ~ density]}{time}$ ] and assume that unit @xmath13 could be contributed , for instance , from hubble parameter . over years </S>",
    "<S> different models of interactions were proposed and considered , but everything was done on phenomenological level only . </S>",
    "<S> very intensively were considered interactions @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a coupling constant , other form of interactions , where question of time unit were solved with help of first order time derivative @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> interaction of the general form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 also captured a lot of attention . </S>",
    "<S> interaction between components arose as a result of splitting of the energy conservation , which mathematically can be described as follows : @xmath23 and @xmath24 which could be understood as : there is not energy conservation for the components separately , but due to interaction between all components , energy of whole mixture conserves . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is correct for this moment only . </S>",
    "<S> other type of interaction considered in literature and supported by experimental data is sign - changeable interaction @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by @xcite we would like to consider an interaction where energy density of the ghost dark energy appears @xmath25 by this way we would like to make a possibility for other two components to feel an existence of other component which does not appear in field equations . </S>",
    "<S> the mixture of our consideration will be described by @xmath26 and @xmath27 given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 paper organized as follow : after introduction , in next section we will give field equations and a strategy how to solve and find scale factor @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> then in two other sections we will work in case when there is not interaction between components and then we will switch on interaction . in section discussion </S>",
    "<S> obtained results will be summarized . </S>"
