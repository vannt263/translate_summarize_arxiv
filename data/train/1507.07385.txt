    "localization involves the process of obtaining physical locations using radio signals .",
    "radio signals are exchanged between radios with known and unknown positions .",
    "radios at known positions are called reference radios .",
    "radios at unknown positions are called blind radios .",
    "localization of blind radios reduces to fitting these measured radio signals to appropriate propagation models .",
    "propagation models express the distance between two radios as a function of the measured radio signals .",
    "these measured radio signals are often modeled as deterministic radio signals with noise using a large variety of empirical statistical models @xcite .",
    "radio localization usually involves non - linear numerical optimization techniques that fit parameters in the propagation model given the joint probability distribution of the ensemble of measured radio signals .",
    "localization precision is usually expressed as the root mean squared error ( rmse ) . in the field of wireless sensor networks ,",
    "the estimation bounds on localization precision are often calculated by the cramr - rao lower bound ( crlb ) from empirical signal models with independent noise @xcite .",
    "in general , localization precision depends on whether the measured radio signals contain phase information .",
    "phase information can only be retrieved from measurements that are instantaneous on a time scale that is short relative to the oscillation period of the signals .",
    "the smallest measurable position difference depends on how well phase can be resolved .",
    "this is usually limited by the speed and noise of the electronics of the system .",
    "less complex and less expensive localization systems are based on measurements of time - averaged power flows or received signal strengths ( rss ) .",
    "time - averaging is usually performed over timespans that are large compared to the coherence time of the radios , so that phase information is lost .",
    "rss localization is an example of such less - complex systems .",
    "hence , when determining the bounds on localization precision , it makes sense to distinguish between the time scales of the signal measurements , i.e. between instantaneous and time - averaged signal and noise processing .",
    "speckle theory @xcite describes the phenomenon of power - flow fluctuations due to random roughness from emitting surfaces .",
    "this theory shows that independent sources generate power - flow fluctuations in the far field that are always cross - correlated over a so - called spatial coherence region .",
    "the linear dimension of this region equals the correlation length .",
    "this correlation length has a lower bound in far - field radiation . in all practical cases of interest ,",
    "the lower bound on the correlation length of this far - field coherence region is of the order of half the mean wavelength of the radiation .",
    "this lower bound is called the diffraction limit or rayleigh criterion @xcite .",
    "it is not obvious that this lower bound on correlation length holds in our wireless sensor network setup with its characteristic small cylindrical antennas .",
    "therefore , we derive this lower bound on the correlation length with the corresponding cross - correlation function from the maxwell equations using the ieee formalism described by @xcite .",
    "our derivation of this lower bound on the correlation length and corresponding cross - correlation function leads to the well - known van cittert - zernike theorem , known in other areas of signal processing like radar @xcite , sonar @xcite and optics @xcite .",
    "our novel experimental setup validates that power - flow fluctuations are cross - correlated over a correlation length of half a wavelength by increasing the density of power - flow measurements from one to 25 power - flow measurements per wavelength .    in the field of wireless sensor networks ,",
    "the estimation bounds on localization precision are usually determined by empirical signal models with independent noise over [ space , time ] @xcite .",
    "hence , the correlation length of the radiation is assumed to be infinitely small .",
    "this representation renders practical relevance as long as the inverse of the sampling rate is large compared to the correlation length , so that correlations between measurements are negligibly small .",
    "this paper experimentally and theoretically investigates radio localization in the far field when sufficient measurements are available to reveal the bounds on localization precision .",
    "we use bienayme s theorem @xcite to show that the ensemble of correlated power - flow measurements has an upper bound on the finite number of independent measurements over a finite measuring range .",
    "we show that this finite number of independent measurements depends on the correlation length .",
    "when we account for the finite number of independent measurements in the fisher information , the crlb on localization precision deviates 2 - 3% from our experimental results . we show that this approach provides practically identical results as the crlb for signals with correlated gaussian noise @xcite , given the lower bound on correlation length .",
    "hence , the lower bound on correlation length determines the upper bound on localization precision .",
    "there are a few papers that assume spatially cross - correlated gaussian noise on power - flow measurements @xcite .",
    "these papers consider cross - correlations caused by shadowing that extend over many wavelengths .",
    "@xcite states that their cross - correlation functions do not satisfy the propagation equations .",
    "such cross - correlations have no relation to wavelength of the carrier waves as the diffraction limit is not embedded in the propagation model like we derive .",
    "correlation , coherence and speckle properties of far - field radiation are governed by the spreads of fourier pairs of wave variables that show up as variables in the classical propagation equations of electromagnetic waves .",
    "the products of these spreads of fourier pairs express uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics , which are formulated as bandwidth relations in classical mechanics @xcite and signal processing @xcite .",
    "@xcite mathematically establishes a relationship between fisher information , the crlb and uncertainty .",
    "as uncertainty is lower bounded by diffraction , fisher information is upper bounded and crlb is lower bounded .",

    "the reference radio is successively placed at known positions and is used for estimating the position of the blind radio .",
    "the crosses represent the @xmath2 manual positions of the reference radio ( @xmath3 ) and are uniformly distributed along the circumference of the square ( one position every half centimeter ) .    rather than placing a two - dimensional array of reference radios inside the @xmath0m@xmath1 square",

    "the blind and reference radios are both main powered to minimize voltage fluctuations .",
    "the blind radio has a power amplifier and broadcasts messages with maximum power allowed by etsi to maximize snr .",
    "both blind and reference radios have an external dipole antenna .",
    "the antennas have the same vertical orientation and are in line - of - sight ( los ) for best reception .",
    "this implies that the polarization is vertically oriented perpendicular to the two - dimensional localization plane .",
    "the length of the antenna is half a wavelength .",
    "its diameter is roughly one twentieth of a wavelength .",
    "we keep the relative direction of the printed circuit boards on which the antennas are mounted constant by realigning them every @xmath6 cm . in order to minimize interference from ground reflections , we place the radios directly on the ground , so that their antennas are within one wavelength height .",

    "we minimize interference from ceiling reflections by placing a @xmath7cm@xmath1 aluminum plate one centimeter above the blind radio antenna .",

    "<S> this paper experimentally and theoretically investigates the fundamental bounds on radio localization precision of far - field received signal strength ( rss ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> rss measurements are proportional to power - flow measurements time - averaged over periods long compared to the coherence time of the radiation . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments are performed in a novel localization setup using 2.4ghz quasi - monochromatic radiation , which corresponds to a mean wavelength of 12.5 cm . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally and theoretically show that rss measurements are cross - correlated over a minimum distance that approaches the diffraction limit , which equals half the mean wavelength of the radiation . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments show that measuring rss beyond a sampling density of one sample per half the mean wavelength does not increase localization precision , as the root - mean - squared - error ( rmse ) converges asymptotically to roughly half the mean wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> this adds to the evidence that the diffraction limit determines ( 1 ) the lower bound on localization precision and ( 2 ) the sampling density that provides optimal localization precision . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally validate the theoretical relations between fisher information , cramr - rao lower bound ( crlb ) and uncertainty , where uncertainty is lower bounded by diffraction as derived from coherence and speckle theory . </S>",
    "<S> when we reconcile fisher information with diffraction , the crlb matches the experimental results with an accuracy of 97 - 98% .    </S>",
