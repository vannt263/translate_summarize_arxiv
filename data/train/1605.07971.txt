    "the subject of chirality is ubiquitous in many branches of physics .",
    "it plays a prominent role in the understanding of many physical systems , in particular magnetic systems .",
    "recently , the influence of spin chirality in magnon excitations of ordered quantum magnetic materials has attracted considerable attention .",
    "chirality - induced topological magnetic systems exhibit novel properties @xcite similar to topological insulators in electronic systems @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the propagation of collective excitations ( magnons ) is similar to spin - orbit coupling induced propagation in non - interacting electronic systems .",
    "however , non - interacting magnons can propagate without dissipation as they are uncharged quasiparticles .",
    "this property is crucial for future dissipationless magnon transport @xcite . in magnetic structures with corner sharing triangles ,",
    "chirality is induced by the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction ( dmi ) @xcite and spin scalar chirality is defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 label sites on the triangular plaquettes of the lattice and @xmath2 is the spin at site @xmath3 .",
    "recently , chirality - induced transports have been observed in two - dimensional ( 2d ) single - layer kagome magnet cu(1 - 3 , bdc ) @xcite .",
    "also in a number of 3d single - layer chiral ferromagnetic pyrochlores such as lu@xmath4v@xmath4o@xmath5 , ho@xmath4v@xmath4o@xmath5 , and in@xmath4mn@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite . for ferromagnetic pyrochlores , thermal hall conductivity changes sign upon reversing the direction of magnetic field ,",
    "whereas for kagome magnet thermal hall conductivity changes sign as function of magnetic field or temperature .",
    "there has been a great interest in these chirality - induced topologically protected magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "recently , chirality - induced magnetic bilayer - skyrmion lattice has been shown to exhibit novel properties completely different from single - layer skyrmions @xcite .",
    "however , transport properties of chirality - induced magnetic bilayer magnons have not been addressed in many chiral magnetic systems .    in this letter , we study the chirality - induced magnetic transport in aa - stacked bilayer honeycomb chiral magnet coupled either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically . for ferromagnetically coupled layers , we compute the thermal hall conductivity @xmath6 , which shows a similar trend to that of single - layer honeycomb ferromagnetic insulator @xcite with no sign change . in contrast , for antiferromagnetically coupled layers , we observe a sign change in the thermal hall conductivity and spin nernst conductivity @xcite as the magnetic field is reversed .",
    "we show that fully antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer with ordered nel state exhibits similar properties to that of antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer ferromagnets .",

    "we also observe that for the chirality - proximity effect , where only one layer contains a chiral dmi , topological effects are induced in the bilayer system and thermal conductivity @xmath6 is suppressed ( see the supplemental material : http://stacks.iop.org/jphyscm/28/47lt02/mmedia[stacks.iop.org/jphyscm/28/47lt02/mmedia ] ) .",
    "we have studied chirality - induced magnon transport in aa - stacked bilayer honeycomb chiral magnets .",
    "we observe remarkable distinctive features for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings .",
    "in particular , the band structure and the chiral edge states have different topological properties . as a result thermal hall and spin nernst conductivities show a sign change for antiferromagnetic coupling in contrast to ferromagnetic coupling .",
    "as far as we know , chirality - induced transports and thermal hall effect still await experimental observation on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "as mentioned above , there are many accessible aa - stacked bilayer honeycomb quantum magnets in which chirality can be induced and these theoretical results can be confirmed .",
    "experiments can also probe the observed magnon edge states , by noticing that spin-@xmath8 quantum magnets map to hardcore bosons .",
    "thus , the magnon edge states correspond to bosonic edge states , which can be studied experimentally in ultracold atoms on optical lattices similar to the realization of haldane model @xcite .",
