    "et al . _ and coworkers confirm these findings.@xcite careful density functional calculations by spaldin @xcite also point to difficulties in inducing ferromagnetism by transition metal substitution in zno . we find that while magnetic susceptibility indicates strong near - neighbor coupling in zno:__t__m ( _ _ t__m = mn and co ) , the mean - field coupling is exceedingly weak.@xcite it is the mean field term that would dictate magnetic ordering .",
    "it is useful to temper expectation with the following observation : the few known ferromagnetic oxide semiconductors have rather low @xmath10s : bimno@xmath3 ( @xmath10 = 105 k ) , @xcite secuo@xmath3 ( @xmath10 = 26 k ) , @xcite ytio@xmath3 ( @xmath10 = 29 k ) , @xcite euo ( @xmath10 = 79 k).@xcite    a promising alternative is to induce _ ferrimagnetism _ in a wide band gap semiconductor with _ two _ host cation sites : this would exploit the more natural tendency of spins in insulating oxides to anti - align and would require no conduction electrons . a natural structure for ferrimagnetism",
    "is spinel , ab@xmath0o@xmath5 , where spins in the tetrahedral ( a ) and octahedral ( b ) cation sites are usually anti - aligned with respect to each other ; in addition , with two b sites for every a site , the possibility of a net ferrimagnetic moment exists .",
    "figure  [ fig : structure ] shows the cation network centered around a single tetrahedral a cation in the spinel structure .",
    "the very high effective cation coordination in this structure type would mean that even at rather low concentrations of substituent transition metal ions , extensive magnetic coupling can be expected . in this contribution",

    "the spectra were analyzed using the computer program effino.@xcite",
    "x - ray diffraction data , plotted on a log scale in figure  [ fig : x - ray](a ) , indicate a very small as - yet unidentified impurity at 34.2@xmath19 2@xmath15 in all the samples , including the non - magnetic host znga@xmath0o@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath6 = 0.15 sample has a small impurity of monoclinic ga@xmath0o@xmath3 ( pdf card 41 - 1103 ) .",
    "other than these clearly non - magnetic impurities , the samples are clean showing only the spinel phase",
    ". the diffraction profiles could be satisfactorily fit to the spinel crystal structure by the rietveld method using the xnd program.@xcite for all the samples , reliability factor ( @xmath20 ) was less than 7% .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath21 cell parameter with @xmath6 is shown in figure  [ fig : x - ray](b ) and is consistent with substitution of fe on the spinel znga@xmath0o@xmath5 lattice .",
    "the line connects published cell parameters of znga@xmath0o@xmath5 @xcite and fe@xmath3o@xmath5.@xcite under the conditions of our preparation , fe@xmath3o@xmath5 is stable under the heat treatment conditions which we have employed,@xcite so we were initially confident in describing the fe substitution as a solid solution [ znga@xmath0o@xmath1@xmath2[fe@xmath3o@xmath1@xmath4 .",
    "however , as we shall describe presently , mssbauer spectra indicate a complete absence of fe@xmath12 in the @xmath6 = 0.15 sample .",
    "we do see a small broadening of the x - ray profiles with substitution characteristic of the increased number of elements in the crystal .",

    ".    tem / edx analysis of the @xmath6 = 0.15 sample systematically indicated that the fe : zn : ga atomic ratio was close to 1:3:6 rather than the ratio calculated from the nominal composition which is 1:1.9:3.8 , or nearly 1:2:4 .",
    "more importantly , the samples are homogeneous on the length scale of the edx spot size ( approximately 3 nm ) , consistently displaying the same ratios over several spots .    across the substitution series",
    ", the semiconducting nature of znga@xmath0o@xmath5 is retained as confirmed by uv / vis diffuse - reflectance spectroscopy .",
    "diffuse reflectance uv / vis spectra across the series are shown in figure  [ fig : optical ] .",
    "znga@xmath0o@xmath5 is a direct band gap semiconductor,@xcite as confirmed by the sharp band - edge absorption . in our samples",
    "we find the band edge is at 3.3 ev rather than the reported value of 4.1 ev .",
    "however , it is well known@xcite that znga@xmath0o@xmath5 displays a very sensitive dependence of the optical absorption edge on composition , and a very small concentration of cation vacancies are sufficient to shift the edge to the red .",
    "substitution by iron leaves the band - edge absorption unchanged , though new features associated with atomic transitions arise in the visible region .",
    "the relative rise of these new features in the visible region of the spectrum results in an effective _ relative _ decrease in the intensity of the band - edge absorption .",
    "figure  [ fig : magnetism1](a ) shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization of three samples , @xmath6 = 0.05 , 0.10 , and 0.15 .",
    "the magnetization has been scaled by the mole number of fe@xmath3o@xmath5 ; implying that in the absence of long - range interactions , traces for the three samples should collapse on a single curve .",
    "we do not observe this even at 400 k. plots of @xmath22 as a function of @xmath23 are not linear for any of the samples below 400 k , also in accord with the existence of long - range interactions .",
    "all three samples show a separation of the zfc and fc traces . this is clearly visible for @xmath6 = 0.10 and @xmath6 = 0.15 at about 100 k. at 5 k",
    ", all three samples display hysteretic behavior as seen in figure  [ fig : magnetism1](b ) .",
    "none of the samples show magnetic saturation indicating that a certain fraction of the spins are `` free '' and are not involved in the ordering . if we assume that fe substitutes on znga@xmath0o@xmath5 as an alloy with fe@xmath3o@xmath5 , then the saturation magnetization should be 4 @xmath24 _ per _ fe@xmath3o@xmath5 .",
    "if we take the minimum magnetic saturation value to be the point where the hysteresis loop closes , then for @xmath6 = 0.15 , this value is about 1 @xmath24 _ per _ fe@xmath3o@xmath5 at 5 k. therefore , to a good approximation , 25% of the substituted fe completely participate in the bulk ferrimagnetism .",
    "figure  [ fig : magnetism2 ] displays magnetization for @xmath6 = 0.15 as a function of the scaled field ( @xmath25 ) at three different temperatures , ( a ) 2 k , ( b ) 5 k , and ( c ) 200 k. at the two lower temperatures , hysteretic behavior is observed .",
    "the hysteresis is lost by about 100 k , but even at 200 k , magnetization as a function of field indicates long range ordering .",
    "the nature of the magnetization loops would suggest superparamagnetic behavior with a blocking temperature of around 100 k. however , superparamagnetism would imply that plots of @xmath26 as a function of @xmath25 would collapse on to a single -shaped trace above the blocking temperature .",
    "we do not find this .",
    "figure  [ fig : magnetism2](d ) shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic coercivity of @xmath6 = 0.15 , which grows almost exponentially as the temperature is lowered . at 5",
    "k , the coercivity is about 250 oe , to be compared with a value of 420 oe for fe@xmath3o@xmath5.@xcite      mssbauer spectra were acquired at room temperature ( 293 k ) on @xmath6 = 0.05 sample and the @xmath6 = 0.15 sample . for both samples , the isomer shift with respect to fe metal was 0.32 mm s@xmath27 and the quadrupolar splitting was 0.52 .",
    "neither sample showed , at 293 k , the 6-finger pattern characteristic of magnetic ordering . at 4.2 k , the @xmath6 = 0.15 sample displayed both a doublet corresponding to paramagnetic fe@xmath7 and a 6-finger pattern corresponding to magnetically ordered fe@xmath7 .",
    "the internal field is between 250 and 510 oe , consistent with the magnetization data . from the mssbauer fit to the para and ferromagnetic phases at 4.2 k , a relative ratio of 10% ( paramagnetic ) to 90% ( ferromagnetic ) was obtained .",
    "mssbauer data and the fit to different components , acquired on the @xmath6 = 0.15 sample are shown in figure  [ fig : moess ] .",
    "the relative distribution of fe@xmath7 on octahedral and tetrahedral sites could not be obtained from the present set of experiments .",
    "experiments are planned in future with labeled @xmath18fe in order to obtain higher resolution data that will allow the fe ion site selection to be probed .",
    "the title compounds have random substitution of ferric ions , presumably on both the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in the semiconducting host spinel structure .",
    "since there are twice as many octahedral sites as there are tetrahedral sites , if the spins behave as they do in bulk fe@xmath3o@xmath5 , ferromagnetism can ensue .",
    "we believe this to be at the origin of the observed magnetic behavior .",
