    "the spectra are dominated by the mn @xmath16 core - hole spin - orbit coupling which splits the spectrum roughly in two parts , namely the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 638 - 645  ev ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath18 649 - 654  ev ) white line regions . the line shape strongly depends on the multiplet structure given by the mn 3@xmath20 - 3@xmath20 and 2@xmath21 - 3@xmath20 coulomb and exchange interactions , as well as by the local crystal fields and the hybridization with the o 2@xmath21 ligands .",

    "different polarizations access different orbitals with different probabilities . for the 640.6 ev peak ,",
    "the polarization dependence is reflected in terms of shifts in its energy position .",
    "if one could have measured the polarization dependence along the local coordinates of one mn ion , one may expect to observe peak shifts of 65 and 95  mev associated with the intra  @xmath58  splittings shown in fig .",
    "[ elevel ] . yet , having two mn ions in the unit cell , and measuring along the global @xmath45 , @xmath41 , and @xmath43 crystallographic directions , the shifts between the effectively composite peaks become reduced . in the experiments and in the simulations",
    "we are left with shifts of about 20 and 30 mev as can be seen in the middle bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ mnl ] . for the 639.6 ev peak ,",
    "the shifts due to variation of the polarization are more difficult to quantify since there is also a variation in the intensity of the peaks .",
    "the latter is apparently caused by the rather complicated multiplet effects involving the @xmath16 core hole , as demonstrated by the excellence of the match by the simulations , see the left bottom panel of fig .",
    "these intensity variations are yet quite small , and _ integrated _ over the entire @xmath0  range , would have been even identical to zero if the non - cubic hybridization effects were absent .    the simulations for the polarization dependent spectra for the co @xmath0  edge of cowo@xmath1  are shown in fig .",

    ", we have been able to achieve a satisfying fit to the experimental spectra : all features are well reproduced , including the strong polarization dependence .",

    ", this @xmath67 state will be split upon going to lower crystal symmetry .",
    "the degeneracy in the orbital part , i.e. in the @xmath58 sub - shell , will be lifted .",

    "[ elevel ] .",
    "the calculation with the @xmath33 spin - orbit interaction switched off , see fig .",
    "[ elevel ] ( c ) , reveals the presence of three low - lying quartets within the first 0.1 ev . in an one - electron language",
    ", each of them would correspond to the hole occupying one of the three @xmath58orbitals .",
    "the intra-@xmath58  splittings are 40 mev and 80 mev .",
    "these values are quite close to those of the mnwo@xmath1  case reflecting the similar crystal structure .",
    "the importance of the lifted degeneracy is that the orbital occupation will no longer be isotropic , i.e. the co ion charge distribution will be highly non - spherical .",
    "this then explains the strong polarization dependence in the absorption spectra .",
    "it is also important to notice how the low - lying states of co@xmath2are influenced by the @xmath33 spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the energy level diagram in fig .",
    "[ elevel ] ( d ) reveals that there is indeed a large amount of mixing due to spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling constant of @xmath69 mev is of the same order of magnitude as the splittings in the @xmath58  subshell .",
    "all this has direct consequences on the magnetism , as will be discussed in the next section .    in cowo@xmath1 .",
    "( a ) three - dimensional representation of the magnetic anisotropy in the unit cell .",
    "the surface depicts the expectation value of the magnetic moment @xmath70 pointing parallel to a small exchange field applied to the ion .",
    "( b ) two - dimensional cut of @xmath70 in the plane of easy and intermediate magnetic axis ( corresponding approximately to the @xmath66 plane in local coordinates ) .",
    "( c ) cut through the plane of hard and intermediate magnetic axis.,width=226 ]",
    "from the results of the simulation , we find that the @xmath33 spin - orbit interaction has a major influence on the energies and nature of the low lying states of the cowo@xmath1  system .",
    "the magnetic moment will then not only have a spin contribution but also an appreciable orbital one .",
    "this results in a strong coupling of the direction of magnetic moment to the crystal structure .",
    "we can make an estimate of the single ion anisotropy of the co@xmath2 ion . for that we use the same parameters with which we have reproduced the xas spectra and the polarization dependence therein , and",
    "we apply a small exchange field of @xmath71 ev ( @xmath72 oe ) to align the magnetic moment . here",
    "we would like to note that the results hardly changes with increasing the strength of the field , i.e. they are robust even beyond @xmath73 ev .    fig .",
    "[ dir ] shows the expectation value of the magnetization parallel to the applied exchange field @xmath70 as a three - dimensional representation and in a polar plot , the latter in local coordinates .",
    "it can be seen that the single - ion anisotropy is of easy - axis type , with the axis lying along @xmath74 135@xmath46 at @xmath75 in the local coordinate system . in the direction of the easy axis , the moment is completely directed along the magnetic field , and the perpendicular component of the magnetization vanishes .",
    "the easy axis is also perpendicular to the @xmath65 symmetry axis of the distorted octahedron , reflecting the orbital character of the two lower lying ligand field levels .",
    "the total magnetic moments of the hard and easy axes are 1.2  @xmath76 and 3.0  @xmath76 , respectively , with an orbital contribution of 0.1  @xmath76 and 0.9  @xmath76 .",
    "the easy axis of the total moment coincides directly with that of the orbital moment , which is also pointed out earlier by bruno.@xcite it has also been reported that for low symmetries , the orbital and total moment could differ in their behavior due to the magnetic dipole moment @xmath77.@xcite in the case of cowo@xmath1 , however , with the symmetry of the coo@xmath32 groups being not too far from cubic , this @xmath77 is around @xmath78 ev , and does not influence the anisotropy significantly .    in cowo@xmath1 ,",
    "the single - ion anisotropy is strong enough to lead to an effective pinning of the spins in the magnetically ordered phase .",
    "isotropic superexchange will be the dominating magnetic interaction , although in addition anisotropic exchange is possible , as the bonds lack inversion centers .",
    "but the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) term @xmath79 , that favors canted magnetic moments , is small compared to the energy involved in the magnetic anisotropy of cowo@xmath1 , reflected by the large difference in moment of more than 1  @xmath76 .",
    "the superexchange will then minimize the energy in the magnetically ordered phase by aligning the moments along the easy axis .",
    "the easy axis is identical for both coo@xmath32 clusters in the unit cell , and thus the single - ion anisotropy itself will not lead to canting between the magnetic moments of the co@xmath2  ions .",
    "the result is a collinear antiferromagnet with an easy axis approximately in the @xmath80 plane @xmath81 off from @xmath45 .",
    "this direction is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dir ] and is close to the one found in the experiment by neutron diffraction .",
    "@xcite    returning to mnwo@xmath1  case : to the leading order , the local spherical @xmath56 ground state does not produce an orbital moment .",
    "the spin is then free to point in any direction .",
    "this is reproduced in the calculation , where the response of the magnetic moment to an exchange field is practically isotropic . yet ,",
    "in second order , the spin - orbit coupling does affect the mn - o hopping .",
    "this produces a non - vanishing moment perpendicular to the exchange field , albeit in the order of 10@xmath82  @xmath76 , being much lower than in the case of the spin - orbit active cowo@xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the dm term is on the same energy scale as the anisotropy , and spin canting can easily occur .",
    "the propagation direction of the spiral magnetic order is in the _ local _ @xmath66 plane , meaning that the second order process leads to a hard axis along @xmath40 .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of the single - ion anisotropy in this system .",
    "the form of the anisotropy , however , depends strongly on the magnetic exchange .",
    "this explains that even three different magnetically ordered phases exist in the material at low temperatures.@xcite additionally to the hard axis , the easy plane also has two principal axes for the magnetic anisotropy with a small difference between the two .",
    "this , in combination with the subtle dependency of the anisotropy on the exchange field , makes incommensurabilities likely to appear .",
    "the single - ion anisotropies extracted from our soft x - ray absorption data and the corresponding full - multiplet calculations provide a natural explanation for the magnetic ordering phenomena occurring in cowo@xmath1  and mnwo@xmath1 . in cowo@xmath1 ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupling and a non - vanishing orbital moment overwhelm the anisotropic dzyaloshinskii - moriya exchange and cause the formation of a collinear ordering of the moments .",
    "contrary to that , although being isostructural , mnwo@xmath1  shows only a small magnetic anisotropy which is comparable in energy to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions .",
    "this will ca nt the spins in such a way that the spiral propagates perpendicular to the direction of smallest magnetic moment , allowing a modulated spin spiral which causes the ferroelectricity in the material .",
