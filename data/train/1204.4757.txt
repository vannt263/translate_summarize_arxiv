    "<S> we contrast true fractionalization with two other scenarios which could mimic it  quantum superposition and classical probabilistic electron insertion . </S>",

    "<S> a spectacular feature of strongly correlated low - dimensional electronic systems is that collective behavior renders the electron completely unstable , resulting in its fractionalization  @xcite . as a prime example , in a one - dimensional quantum wire , tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) theory predicts that a momentum - resolved electron tunneling into the wire splinters into charges @xmath0 moving in opposite directions , where @xmath1 , the luttinger parameter depends on the ratio of interactions and fermi energy and is unity in the absence of interactions  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> these studies inspire revisiting fractionalization in a new light and addressing a spectrum of theoretical and physical issues . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , can one distinguish true fractionalization from quantum mechanical probabilistic processes ? or even classical probabilities ? are there geometries which could eliminate one of the biggest banes in detecting fractionalization  the effect of leads  @xcite ? </S>",
    "<S> what measurements in such geometries could pinpoint true fractionalization ? in this letter , we answer each of these questions in the context of the ring geometry illustrated in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : setup ] .    here , an electron tunnels from a lead into a thin mesoscopic ring and , as with the quantum wire  @xcite , has a well - defined momentum profile . </S>",
    "<S> strong interactions within the ring cause an electron associated , for instance , with clockwise fermi - momentum to decompose into two components of charge @xmath0 moving in clockwise ( cw ) and counter - clockwise ( ccw ) directions . </S>",
    "<S> our study focuses on the magnetic field produced by such a situation and the signatures of fractionalization reflected in the spatial distribution of higher moments involving this field . specifically , we propose measurements of the field squared , as for instance can be measured by a squid , and the power induced by the field in a pickup loop ( see fig .

    "<S> fractionalization emerges from the strongly correlated nature of the many - body wavefunction and is fundamentally different from quantum mechanical superpositions or classical probabilities involving individual particles even though these processes can mimic one another in measurements . in our situation </S>",
    "<S> , we explore three different scenarios that represent each of these situations . </S>",
    "<S> first , the fractionalized state resulting from the tunneling of a cw moving electron @xmath2 having a wave function spread @xmath3 above the tll ground state , @xmath4 , is given by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> second , a quantum superposition state , @xmath6 , that mimics the fractionalized state would consist of superpositions of cw@xmath7/ccw@xmath8 _ electrons _ excited above a non - interacting fermi gas ground state @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 , where @xmath11 correspond to the mimicking probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> third , a classical probabilistic situation would correspond to an ensemble of cw and ccw electrons excited in the non - interacting fermi gas , denoted by the density matrix @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , after introducing fractionalization in the tll liquid ring setting , we show that a combination of the two magnetic field measures combined with persistent current signatures in the mesoscopic ring , at once distinguish the three different scenarios and provide a means of extracting the luttinger parameter .     </S>",
    "<S> fractionalizes into clockwise- and counterclockwise - moving quasiparticles . </S>",

    "<S> the ring geometry imposes periodic boundary conditions on electron operators such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is any flux threading the ring and @xmath21 . for electrons filling a fermi sea </S>",
    "<S> , we decompose the electron operators as @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the creation operator for a @xmath24 moving electron . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy for linearized low - energy modes moving at a fermi velocity @xmath25 takes the form @xmath26 . as is commonly done , we restrict interaction effects to the short - range form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the sum of charge densities @xmath29 . of physical interest , </S>",
    "<S> the current operator is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> this model is amenable to a bosonization treatment via the transformation @xmath32 giving @xmath33 , where the chiral bosonic fields @xmath34 satisfy the commutation relations @xmath35 =   i r \\delta_{r r ' } \\mbox{sgn}(x - x')$ ] and @xmath36 is the fermi momentum . </S>",

    "<S> more explicitly , in the situation of interest , the state of the ring after the injection of a cw moving electron at time @xmath50 is given by @xmath51  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to calculate the expectation value of the current in this state , @xmath52 , yielding @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq : currentexp}\\ ] ] the form of the current explicitly demonstrates that the electron splinters into two components that rotate in opposite directions , have the same profile @xmath3 and carry charges @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field produced by these counter - propagating charges can be evaluated by using the biot - savart law to define the magnetic field operator at position @xmath54 as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is permeability of free space . at any given point having polar coordinates @xmath57 in the plane of the ring , where the origin is at the ring s center and the electron is inserted at @xmath58 , the current in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : currentexp ] produces a field perpendicular to the plane . for the case of @xmath59 having a spread much smaller than the ring diameter </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath60-component of the field takes the form @xmath61 , \\label{eq : bz}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , a time - resolved measurement of the magnetic field , as with other quantities , such as conductance , would yield information on fractionalization . </S>",
    "<S> however , as is the goal here , we seek low - frequency or time averaged signatures . </S>",
    "<S> although the tunneling of the electron picks out a specific point on the ring , signatures are effaced by time - averaging of any quantity that is linear in the ring current . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath64 shows an isotropic spatial profile . </S>",
    "<S> ( here , we use the overline to denote time average . )    </S>",
    "<S> we thus focus on two measures that are quadratic in the current and can be obtained from a continuous weak linear measurement  @xcite via inductive coupling to the ring . </S>",
    "<S> the first is simply @xmath65 , which can be accessed in a squid detector biased to a minimum of its i - v characteristic curve . </S>",
    "<S> the second is the average power received by a detector , for example , an ultra - sensitive bolometer . for a small conducting detector ( ignoring local spatial variations in the magnetic field ) , this is given by @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , note that the former involves a quantum average of a quadratic operator and the latter that of a linear operator .     and </S>",

    "<S> spectral weight is transferred to the non - zeroth coefficients reflecting increasing anisotropy . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the forms of the moments @xmath71 and @xmath72 can be easily evaluated by taking appropriate quantum expectations ( @xmath76 ) and time averages ( overline ) to obtain @xmath77 $ ] and a similar form for @xmath78 with @xmath79 replaced by its time derivative @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> information on fractionalization is best analyzed by resolving these quantites into their angular fourier coefficients : @xmath81 in the non - interacting ( @xmath82 ) limit , an electron circles the ring in the cw direction , retaining rotational symmetry on average and thus we have @xmath83 .    </S>",
    "<S> the plots in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : templates ] capture our central result that higher moments of the current and of the magnetic field profile ( in our case , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) reflect the concurrent motion of fractionalized charge components in their rotational symmetry broken distributions . in the explicit forms of @xmath71 and @xmath72 above , given that @xmath84 preserves rotational symmetry while @xmath85 breaks it , we see that primarily @xmath86 scale as @xmath87 and @xmath88 as @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution is illustrated in the plots of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : templates ] and also agrees with the rotationally symmetric non - interacting limit ( @xmath82 ) . the bilateral symmetry of the plots reflects the two charge components moving away from the injection point and towards the diametrically opposite point . </S>",
    "<S> that these two special points exist for any arbitrary closed shape suggests that our result that fractionalization causes a distribution that distinguishes two points is robust for any closed loop .    </S>",
    "<S> we contrast the behavior of the moments @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the fractionalized state to the quantum and classical probabilistic situations . in the quantum state @xmath6 , a superposition of cw and ccw moving electrons , quantum averages of operators that are linear in the current mimic charge fractionalization while their higher moments , ( for example , @xmath90)those of linear operators do not . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath91 is isotropic but @xmath92 shows an anisotropic profile similar to that of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : templates ] . b. for the classical situation described by the density matrix @xmath93 , the moments are evaluated by separately considering cw and ccw electrons and adding their appropriately weighted contributions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , both moments yield isotropic profiles . as summarized in table . </S>",
    "<S> i , the two measurements therefore can distinguish between the three possible scenarios .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the differences mentioned here , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite distinguishes true fractionalization from other situations by the profound observation that charge fluctuations are in fact a feature of the many - body groundstate and the background of particle - hole excitations while the fractionalized electron is itself ` sharp ' . </S>",
    "<S> translated to our setting , we expect fluctuations in the magnetic field to be induced even by the quiescent tll ring ( having no extra tunneled electron ) and identical to those induced by the fractionalized state @xmath94 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus far , we have described the injection localized electron wavepacket as a superposition of plasmon - like modes described by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : hamll ] . typically , due to coupling to the environment  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , these modes have a finite lifetime , giving rise to a characteristic decoherence time @xmath95 within which measurements need to be performed . however , for timescales longer than @xmath95 , no plasmons are excited and tunneled electrons need purely be described by the excess electron number , @xmath96 , and the persistent current due to the number imbalance between ccw- and cw - moving electrons , @xmath97 , where we define @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal values of these ` topological ' quantities @xmath99 and @xmath100 can be tuned by the application of a gate potential @xmath101 and external flux @xmath20 , and can be determined by minimizing the energy functional derived from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : hamll]@xcite @xmath102 - \\mu n. \\label{eq : cb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the regions of different optimal @xmath99 and @xmath100 values can be charted by coulomb blockade measurements wherein conductance peaks track electron occupation numbers on the ring . </S>",
    "<S> we show the boundaries for these regions in ( dimensionless ) @xmath101-@xmath20 parameter space in fig.[fig : cb ] . </S>",
    "<S> interactions render these regions to be generically hexagonal , characterized by horizontal sides of length @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the geometry of this diagram is an easily accessible , alternate means of extracting @xmath1 , the luttinger parameter .     of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : cb ] . </S>",
    "<S> each cell corresponds to a given electron number ( @xmath99 ) and persistent current ( @xmath100 ) which optimizes @xmath103 as a function of chemical potential ( horizontal axis ) and magnetic flux ( vertical ) ; </S>",
    "<S> bright lines indicate a transition in which @xmath100 or @xmath99 changes by 1 . </S>",
    "<S> cells are ( a ) diamond shaped for @xmath104 ( non - interacting system ) and ( b ) hexagonal shaped for @xmath105 with horizontal side length @xmath89 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> a highlight of this slow - time regime is that it offers another route to distinguishing the fractionalized state @xmath106 by way of persistent current analysis . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately this state is associated with a cw electron and hence has the fixed current value @xmath107 while the quantum and classical states characterized by @xmath6 and @xmath93 involve cw and ccw electrons , thus showing values @xmath108 which vary between measurements . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as summarized in table i , the anisotropy in moment @xmath71 and non - variability in persistent current distinguish the fractionalized state from the quantum and classical scenarios ( though the latter is not a smoking gun test ) while anisotropy in the moment @xmath72 distinguishes classical scenario .    finally , to provide relevant estimates for experiments , for radius @xmath109 m and typical circulating frequency @xmath110 hz , we have @xmath111 and @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> an important requirement is that the injection of an electron must be made on a timescale @xmath113 in order for there to be a ` clean ' injection of the electron . for the ring </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the tunnel junction resistance and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 f ) is the ring capacitance . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the requirement that @xmath118m@xmath119 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the coulomb blockade limit holds only if @xmath120 k@xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we need a @xmath121 k@xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> another consideration is that interaction effects at the tunneling point restrict the energy window in which our results hold  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the electron s spin can also come into play and can be analyzed by a simple generalization of our results .    in conclusion , we have presented an alternative to the quantum wire based electron - in electron - out paradigm for charge fractionalization in the arena of weak measurements in mesoscopic rings . </S>",
