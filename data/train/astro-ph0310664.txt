    "observational studies using high - resolution quasar absorption spectra have firmly established the presence of heavy elements such as carbon @xcite , silicon @xcite , and oxygen @xcite in the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "these metals constitute an important record of star formation and of the feedback of galactic matter into the igm .",
    "this paper is the third in a series employing the statistics of pixel optical depths to study the enrichment of the igm .",
    "the basic technique  pioneered by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also dav et al .",
    "1998 and songaila 1998 ) and later employed by  @xcite and @xcite  was developed and extensively tested using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by aguirre , schaye & theuns ( 2001 ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the technique was then generalized and applied to 19 high - quality spectra in order to measure the full distribution of carbon as a function of redshift and gas density in schaye et al .",
    "( 2003 ; hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "see  @xcite and  @xcite for other recent studies applying the pixel method to  and .",
    "most studies of the enrichment of the igm have focused on absorption because it is strong and lies redward of the ly@xmath9 forest . moreover , as shown in paper ii , ratios of  and optical depths can be converted into carbon abundances using an ionization correction that is neither very large , nor very sensitive to the temperature and density of the absorbing gas . while measurements of the distribution of carbon provide important information on the mechanism by which the igm was enriched , _ relative _ abundance information is crucial for identifying the types of sources responsible for the enrichment .",
    "previous studies have established the presence of  absorption in the igm at @xmath10 and have used simple ionization models to infer that their data is consistent with si / c exceeding the solar ratio by a factor of a few ( @xcite ;   @xcite ;  @xcite ; boksenberg , sargent & rauch 2003 ) . the observed ratios of /  have also been used to study the shape and evolution of the ionizing uv background ( uvb ) , but with conflicting results : while  @xcite sees an abrupt change in /  column density ratios at @xmath11 , @xcite see no evidence for any evolution .",
    "this paper presents measurements of the relative abundances of silicon and carbon in the igm , obtained by comparing the statistics of , , and  pixel optical depths in a sample of 19 high - quality quasar spectra to synthetic spectra obtained using a cosmological , hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "our primary goal is to measure the overall si / c abundance ratio in the gas for which  absorption is detected , given a model for the extragalactic ionizing uvb . in doing so",
    ", we also obtain some information on how much the distribution of silicon may differ from that of carbon ( beyond an overall difference in the normalization ) , as well as constraints on the shape and the evolution of the uvb and on the thermal state of the absorbing gas .",
    "we have organized this paper as follows . in   [ sec - data ] and  [ sec - meth ] we briefly describe our sample of qso spectra and our methodology ( both of which are discussed at length in paper ii ) . in  [ sec - resrel ]",
    "we first show results for our best qso spectrum , q1422 + 230 , as an illustration of the method .",
    "we then give measurements ( using the full sample ) of the @xmath0 ratio , from which we infer the relative abundance of silicon to carbon ( [ si / c ] ) for our fiducial uvb model ( which is , as in paper ii , a re - normalized version of that given for galaxies and quasars by haardt & madau 2001 , hereafter hm01 ) .",
    "next we give results for other uvb models , and discuss to what extent our data can constrain the uvb shape and evolution , and the variations in [ si / c ] .",
    "we then give and interpret measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( which help constrain the thermal state of the absorbing gas ) .",
    "we discuss and interpret our results in  [ sec - discuss ] , and conclude in  [ sec - conc ] .",
    "we analyze a sample of 19 high - quality ( @xmath14 velocity resolution , signal - to - noise ratio [ s / n ] @xmath15 ) absorption spectra of @xmath16 quasars .",
    "the sample is identical to that of paper ii .",
    "it includes fourteen spectra taken with the uv - visual echelle spectrograph  ( uves , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) and five taken with the high resolution echelle spectrograph  ( hires , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the keck telescope .",
    "see paper ii (   2 ) for a description of the sample and data reduction .",
    "the basic method employed is similar to that described in papers i and ii , to which we refer the reader for details and tests . section [ sec - overview ] contains a brief overview of the method .",
    "readers who want more detail would benefit from also reading sections [ sec - recovery] [ sec - compmeth ] which summarize the method , making reference to the relevant sections of papers i and ii , and noting the changes to the method used in paper ii .      for each qso spectrum , we first recover the optical depths due to ly@xmath9 ( @xmath17   ) absorption in all pixels in the ly@xmath9 forest region",
    ". then we recover the optical depth in pixels at the corresponding wavelengths of metal lines such as  ( @xmath18 ) , ( @xmath19 ) , and  ( @xmath20 ) and correlate the ( apparent ) optical depth in one transition with that in another .",
    "we do this by binning the pixels in terms of the optical depth of the most easily detected transition , e.g. , , and plotting the median optical depth of the other transition , e.g. , , against it .",
    "a correlation then indicates a detection of  absorption ; see the bottom curve in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sivscat ] for an example . by doing the same for percentiles other than the 50th ( i.e. , the median ) we obtain information on the full probability distribution of pixel optical depths ( see the other curves in the panel ) . in this way",
    "a large quantity of information can be extracted from each observed spectrum .    by comparing the observed optical depths with those obtained from synthetic spectra generated using a hydrodynamical simulation ,",
    "we make inferences about the distribution of silicon . for each observed spectrum",
    ", we generate a large set of spectra drawn from the simulation and process them to give them the same noise properties , wavelength coverage , resolution , etc .",
    ", as the observed spectrum .",
    "we do this for each of several uvb models ; for each model the simulations include a carbon distribution as measured in paper ii for that assumed uvb , and some value of [ si / c ] , and @xmath21 @xcite . ] with ionization balances computed using the cloudy package ( version 94 ; see ferland et al .",
    "1998 and ferland 2000 for details ) .",
    "we analyze these simulated spectra in exactly the same manner as the observed ones , and compare the simulated and observed pixel optical depth statistics .",
    "the uvb models we employ are those in paper ii (   4.2 ) .",
    "all are based on the models of haardt & madau ( 2001 ; see also 1996 ) , but renormalized ( by a redshift - dependent factor ) so that the simulated spectra match our measurement ( paper ii ) of the evolution of the mean ly@xmath9 absorption .",
    "our fiducial model , `` qg '' , includes contributions from both galaxies ( with a 10% escape fraction for ionizing photons ) and quasars ; `` q '' includes only quasars ; `` qgs '' is an artificially softened version of qg : its flux has been reduced by a factor of ten above 4  ryd .",
    "model `` qgs3.2 '' is like model qg for @xmath22 and like model qgs for @xmath23 and was constructed to crudely model the possible evolution of the uvb if  was suddenly reionized at @xmath24 .      after continuum fitting the spectra ( paper ii ,  5.1 , step 1 ) , we derive  ly@xmath9 optical depths @xmath25 for each pixel between the quasar s ly@xmath9 and ly@xmath26 emission wavelengths , although we exclude regions close to the quasar to avoid proximity effects ( paper ii ,  2 ) .",
    "we use higher - order lyman lines to estimate @xmath25 if ly@xmath9 is saturated ( i.e. , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the flux and noise arrays , see paper i ,  4.1 ; paper ii ,  5.1 , step 2 ) . for each  pixel",
    "we then derive the corresponding  ( and ) optical depths @xmath30 ( and @xmath1 ) , correcting for self - contamination and removing contamination by other lines ( paper i ,  4.2 ) .",
    "in addition , we recover  optical depths @xmath31 , correcting for contamination by higher - order lines ( paper i ,  4.2 ) .",
    "we thus have four sets of corresponding pixel optical depths that may be correlated with each other .",
    "this study makes extensive comparisons between our set of observed spectra and those generated from a cosmological simulation .",
    "the same simulation was used in papers i (  3 ) and ii (  4.1 ) , to which the reader is referred for details .",
    "briefly , the simulation uses a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code to model the evolution of a periodic , cubic region of a @xmath32 universe of comoving size @xmath33 , down to redshift @xmath34 using @xmath35 particles for both the cold dark matter and the baryonic components .",
    "the uvb used in the simulation was chosen to match ( and only affects ) the igm temperature as measured by  @xcite .",
    "synthetic spectra are generated as described in papers i (  3 ) and ii (  4.1 ) , by computing the ionization balance for each particle using an assumed uniform uvb , then passing random sightlines through the snapshots of the simulation box and patching these sightlines together to form one long spectrum .",
    "transitions due to , , , , , , , and 31 lyman lines of  are included .",
    "the spectra also include noise , instrumental broadening and pixelization chosen to match the observed spectra in detail .      our simulations ( paper i ,  5.1 ) and those of others  ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that there is a tight correlation between @xmath25 and the density and temperature of gas giving rise to the absorption . in paper ii we used this predicted correlation to compute an ionization correction ( i.e. , the ratios of /c and /h ) in order to convert ratios of @xmath36 into carbon abundances as a function of density ( paper i ,  6 ; paper ii ,  5.1 , step 5 and  5.2 ) .",
    "this method works well for  because the ionization correction varies slowly with density ( and therefore with @xmath37 ) in the density range probed by the ly@xmath9 forest ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is _ not _ the case for : fig .",
    "[ fig : sivhipred ] shows that while relatively insensitive to gas temperature , the ionization correction factor , @xmath39 - \\log({\\tau_{\\rm siiv}}/{\\tau_{\\rm hi}})$ ] , increases dramatically with decreasing density , from @xmath40 at an overdensity @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 at @xmath43 ) up to @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "we find that this renders ionization corrections as used in paper ii unreliable for , because very small errors in the inferred optical depth lead to large errors in the recovered silicon abundance . rather than applying ionization corrections to the data ,",
    "we therefore concentrate on directly comparing the predictions of our hydrodynamical simulation to the observed spectra . using the measurements of the carbon distribution obtained in paper ii ,",
    "we find the value of [ si / c ] that best fits the data .    for each observed quasar we generate 50 corresponding simulated spectra with the same noise properties , wavelength coverage , pixelization , instrumental broadening , and excluded regions .",
    "we apply to the simulated spectra the same automated continuum fitting routine as was used for the observations ( paper ii ,   5.1 ,",
    "step 1 ; see also paper i ,   4.1 ) to reduce any differences in the continuum fitting errors between simulated and observed spectra .    before generating the spectra , we first impose a carbon distribution in the simulation that is consistent with the measurements presented in paper ii . in that paper",
    "we found that for a given overdensity and redshift , the probability distribution for the carbon abundance is well - described by a lognormal function , and we presented fits of the parameters of the distribution ( i.e. , the median and the width ) as a function of overdensity and redshift for four different uvbs ( paper ii , eqn .  8 and table 2 ) .",
    "for the qg and q ionizing backgrounds these fits are consistent with no evolution and we use the values for @xmath43 ; for models qgs and qgs3.2 we use , for each quasar , the median redshift of the analyzed region .",
    "we divide each simulation snapshot into @xmath46 cubes , and assign the gas particles in each section a carbon abundance of @xmath47=\\alpha + \\beta(z-3)+\\gamma(\\log\\delta-0.5)+s,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 , which is the same for all particles in the sub - volume , is drawn at random from a lognormal distribution with mean 0 and variance @xmath49 ) = 0.70 $ ] , and @xmath50 is the overdensity of the particle . for qg , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ; for q , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath53 ( see paper ii , table  2 for values used for other uvbs ) .",

    "( the assumption that silicon tracks carbon perfectly is tested below . )    for each observed and simulated quasar spectrum , optical depths for pixels corresponding to absorption by , ,  and are extracted as described in   [ sec - recovery ] .",
    "we may then plot various percentiles ( such as the median ) of the @xmath56 distribution for each bin in @xmath1 .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to correlate  with , or  with . for each  ( or other ) bin ,",
    "errors on the observed points are calculated by bootstrap resampling the spectrum , i.e. , we divide the ly@xmath9 forest region of the spectrum into chunks of 5    which are bootstrap resampled to form a new realization of the spectrum ( see paper ii  5.1 , step 3 ) .",
    "we require that in each bin there be at least five pixels above the percentile being computed , and that at least 25 pixels and five chunks contribute to the bin so that the errors are reliable ; otherwise the point is discarded .",
    "for the simulations we compute 50 synthetic spectra and each percentile in each bin is set equal to the median of the 50 realizations , with errors given by bootstrap resampling the 50 simulated spectra .",
    "we require each bin of each realization to have at least five pixels above the given percentile , and to have at least five pixels and one chunk contributing to the bin , and we discard medians computed with fewer than five acceptable realizations .    for each percentile",
    ", the correlation disappears below some optical depth @xmath57 at a value @xmath58 that is determined by noise , continuum fitting errors , and contamination by other lines .",
    "these may be corrected for by subtracting @xmath58 from the binned optical depths , thus converting points at @xmath59 into upper limits ( paper ii , section 5.1 , step 4 , and fig .",
    "4 ) . for each realization",
    ", we compute @xmath58 as the given percentile of the optical depth for pixels with @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is chosen as the  or  optical depth below which we never see a correlation .. for siiv the correlations are generally less strong than for civ and we fix @xmath57 `` by hand '' .",
    "for bins in @xmath25 , we use @xmath61 . ] the error on @xmath58 for each realization is computed by bootstrap - resampling the quasar spectrum . when the realizations are combined , the value of @xmath62 is computed as the median among the realizations , and the error on this value is computed by bootstrap - resampling the realizations .",
    "the binned optical depth percentiles are then compared directly to the simulations , point by point .",
    "because of slight differences in contamination , accuracy of continuum fitting , and noise , @xmath62 for a given qso may differ slightly from that of the simulations . because we do not want to compare noise with noise , we either : a ) subtract @xmath58 from both simulations and observations before comparing , has been subtracted by computing a fine grid of errors ( e.g. , @xmath63 ) . ] or b ) add a constant to the simulated optical depths , chosen to minimize the difference between the simulations and observations for @xmath59 ; in this case we compare only points at @xmath64",
    "before presenting the results from our full sample , we illustrate the optical depth statistics by showing some results from our qso with the strongest signal , q1422 + 230 .      fig .",

    "the good fit of the median indicates that a uniform [ si / c ] @xmath77 model fits well ( though slightly higher [ si / c ] are favored ; see below ) , and that the data do not require any strong trend of [ si / c ] with density ( for which @xmath1 is a proxy ) .",
    "comparison of the higher percentiles can help constrain scatter in @xmath0 , which depends on the scatter in both [ si / c ] and the ionization correction , and it is clear that that simulations with uniform [ si / c ] and a uniform uvb fit the observations well ; this is quantified below using our full data sample .",
    "comparison between simulated and observed @xmath30 versus @xmath25 ( right ) is somewhat less straightforward , as it depends both on [ si / c ] and on the assumed distribution of carbon .",

    "the predicted higher percentiles are , however , a bit low ; this is partly because the q1422 + 230 absorbers happen to exhibit slightly more metallicity scatter ( @xmath78dex ; see paper ii , ",
    "5.2 ) than the level derived from the full sample .    in summary ,",

    "a uniform [ si / c]@xmath77 is favored , 2 .",
    "there is no evidence for a trend of [ si / c ] with density , 3 .",

    "<S> the ratio @xmath0 depends strongly on @xmath1 , but it is nearly independent of redshift for fixed @xmath1 , and is inconsistent with a sharp change in the hardness of the uvb at @xmath2 . scaling the simulated optical depth ratios gives a measurement of the global si / c ratio ( using our fiducial uvb , which includes both galaxy and quasar contributions ) of [ si / c]@xmath3 , with a possible systematic error of @xmath4dex . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred [ si / c ] depends on the shape of the uvb ( harder backgrounds leading to higher [ si / c ] ) , ranging from [ si / c]@xmath5 for a quasar - only uvb , to [ si / c]@xmath6 for a uvb including both galaxies and artificial softening ; this provides the dominant uncertainty in the overall [ si / c ] . </S>",
    "<S> examination of the full @xmath0 distribution yields no evidence for inhomogeneity in [ si / c ] and constrains the width of a lognormal probability distribution in [ si / c ] to be much smaller than that of [ c / h ] ; this implies a common origin for si and c. since the inferred [ si / c ] depends on the uvb shape , this also suggests that inhomogeneities in the hardness of the uvb are small . </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence for evolution in [ si / c ] . </S>",
    "<S> variation in the inferred [ si / c ] with density depends on the uvb and rules out the quasar - only model unless [ si / c ] increases sharply at low density . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons with low - metallicity halo stars and nucleosynthetic yields suggest either that our fiducial uvb is too hard or that supermassive population iii stars might have to be included . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred [ si / c ] , if extrapolated to low density , corresponds to a contribution to the cosmic si abundance of [ si / h]@xmath7 , or @xmath8 , a significant fraction of all si production expected by @xmath2 . </S>"
