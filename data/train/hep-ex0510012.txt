    "inclination , @xmath2 to @xmath3  km height ) to study the cosmic ray flux , with a special interest on the antimatter component .",
    "the detector is composed of several subsystems , schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pamela ] : a time of flight ( tof ) apparatus , which also provides the trigger signal , a solid state magnetic spectrometer  @xcite , surrounded by an anticoincidence shield , and an electromagnetic calorimeter  @xcite in which single  sided silicon detector planes are interleaved with tungsten absorber up to a total thickness of about @xmath4 radiation lengths .",
    "anticoincidence scintillators define the external geometry of the detector and their signals will be exploited in the off  line rejection of spurious tracks ; below the calorimeter another scintillator plane ( s4 ) and a neutron detector can provide additional information when showers are not fully contained in the calorimeter .",
    ".,width=291 ]    .,width=275 ]    the whole detector can discriminate protons and electrons from their antiparticles and provide energy measurements ; also @xmath5 nuclei may cross the entire spectrometer and consequently can be detected .",
    "antimatter acquisitions will cover the energy range @xmath6  mev@xmath7  gev for antiprotons and @xmath8  mev@xmath9  gev for positrons , so extending the current upper limit ( about @xmath8  gev ) given by balloon ",
    "borne missions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the long duration of the flight will provide larger statistics in particular in the high  energy range , where the power  law spectrum of cosmic rays requires either large acceptances or long exposure times astronomical unit from the sun is proportional to @xmath10 in the energy range @xmath11  @xcite . ] .",
    "the obtained high  energy antiparticle flux will constrain the models describing the origin of antimatter in the universe .",
    "the apparatus can be exploited also to find dark ",
    "matter signatures through the detection of high  energy antiprotons originating from neutralino annihilations  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer is the core of the pamela apparatus : it is based on a permanent magnet and consists of six detector planes which measure both the impact coordinates of the incoming particles .",
    "the magnet is made of a nd  fe  b alloy , with a high value of the residual magnetization ( about @xmath12  t ) .",
    "blocks of magnetic material define a rectangular cavity ( @xmath13 ) where particles are detected . here",
    "the magnetic field is roughly uniform and oriented along the y coordinate in the pamela reference frame ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pamela ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "particles are bent in the xz plane within the cavity , due to the lorentz force @xmath14 .",
    "five identical magnetic modules , each one @xmath6  mm high , are superimposed each other and interleaved with six detector planes , which are inserted in the magnetic tower by means of dedicated slits .",
    "the magnetic field in the centre of the cavity is @xmath15  t. measurements of the three components of the magnetic field have been taken at a fixed pitch in about @xmath16 points inside the cavity .",
    "such values will be used during the off  line analysis to precisely determine the particle s momentum through a numerical integration of its equation of motion inside the cavity .      when the characteristics of the pamela experiment were studied , the main requirements of the detectors to be used in the magnetic spectrometer were defined .",
    "essentially they can be listed as in the following :    1 .",
    "provide two coordinates per detector ; 2 .",
    "maximize the spatial resolution , in particular for the bending coordinate ; 3 .",
    "minimize the multiple scattering .",
    "the best candidates to comply with such requirements appeared to be double  sided silicon microstrip detectors with a small strip pitch , associated with low  noise electronics .",
    "the multiple scattering was limited by excluding any dead layer above or beneath the detectors . in the resulting configuration",
    "six detectors , manufactured by hamamatsu photonics  @xcite , are arranged in each plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photoplane ] ) .",
    "a detector is made of a @xmath17 m thick @xmath18type silicon wafer , with @xmath19type strips implanted at @xmath20 m pitch on the junction side .",
    "these strips are used to determine the x coordinate of the incoming particle .",
    "@xmath21type strips , orthogonal to the previous ones , are implanted with @xmath22 m pitch on the y ( ohmic ) side .",
    "the read  out pitch on the junction side is actually @xmath23 m , since a @xmath19 strip out of two is left floating : charge collected by that strip influences the output of the adjacent read  out channels  @xcite . on the ohmic side",
    "a @xmath19 blocking strip is added between two consecutive @xmath18 strips in order to increase the interstrip resistance .",
    "integrated decoupling capacitors are present on both sides : they are obtained by depositing an insulating layer ( @xmath24 m @xmath25 ) and metallic strips above the implants . on the ohmic view a second metal layer , separated by another @xmath25 deposition , @xmath26 m thick , brings the read  out metallic strips parallel to the junction side s ones . both surfaces of the detectors are passivated ; electrical signals can be taken out from metallic pads located at both ends of the strips . the depletion voltage given by",
    "the manufacturer is @xmath27  v and @xmath6  v bias will be supplied during the operational phase .",
    "the detectors are arranged in three modules named ladders : two sensors and a double  sided hybrid circuit form each ladder .",
    "these elements are glued in such a way that x side strips meet at their ends : electrical connections among the corresponding strips are provided by @xmath28 m wire bonds on both sides . on the ohmic view two distinct strips , about @xmath29 apart , are connected to the same electronic channel , so giving rise to a position ambiguity , that can be easily resolved on the basis of the other pamela s subdetectors .",
    "the percentage of bad strips , due mainly to unconnected or noisy channels , ranges between @xmath30% and @xmath31% for all the ladders .",
    "the mechanical structure of the plane is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : photoplane ] and it minimizes the multiple scattering since no additional dead layer is present on the particle s trajectory .",
    "nevertheless , in order to increase the rigidity of the structure , four carbon ",
    "fibre bars ( visible in the photograph ) with very high young modulus ( about @xmath32  gpa ) are glued at both sides of each ladder .",
    "the resulting plane has the first resonance frequency located beyond @xmath32  hz and it has survived vibrational tests whose intensities were twice those expected during the launch of the satellite  @xcite . a summary of geometrical and electrical characteristics of the detectors is given in table  [ tab : charact ] .",
    ".geometrical and electrical characteristics of the silicon microstrip detectors . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]         in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] the results provided by the mentioned methods on both sides are shown . on the junction side it can be noticed that the @xmath33 algorithm gives the best resolution for orthogonal or slightly inclined tracks , as already stated in literature  @xcite : in our configuration @xmath33 is the preferable method up to about @xmath34  deg .",
    "for larger angles , the original methods @xmath35 and @xmath36 give a more accurate particle position , compared to the centre of gravity , suggested in the ref .",
    "@xcite for intermediate incidence angles .",
    "in particular , @xmath35 can be used from about @xmath34 to @xmath37  deg . and",
    "@xmath36 from @xmath37 to @xmath38  deg .",
    "the spatial resolution ranges between less than @xmath0 m and about @xmath39 m on the angular interval corresponding to the acceptance of the spectrometer . on the ohmic side",
    "a better resolution ( about @xmath40 m rms ) is achieved for inclined ( @xmath41  deg . )",
    "this is due to a greater percentage of clusters with multiplicity @xmath42 compared to case of perpendicular tracks , which result in a higher accuracy of the reconstructed position .",
    "let us now briefly discuss how the spatial resolution , achieved at a given angle , influences the scientific objectives of the pamela experiment .",
    "the silicon microstrip detectors are the sensitive elements of a magnetic spectrometer that determines the momentum of the crossing charged particles .",
    "the obtained uncertainty @xmath43 in the reconstructed momentum is directly related , besides the magnetic field value and the geometry of the spectrometer , to the spatial resolution on the x ( bending ) view .",
    "usually the performances of the instrument are given in terms of the rigidity @xmath44 , defined as momentum  to  charge ratio : when @xmath45  % the spectrometer has reached the maximum detectable rigidity ( mdr ) .",
    "in pamela the value @xmath46  @xcite has been measured on a test beam for electrons whose arrival directions are orthogonal to the sensors .",
    "this value is influenced by the presence of tails in the distribution of residuals that can in principle be associated with errors in the charge sign of the reconstructed events .",
    "this problem becomes relevant in pamela because few antiparticles have to be identified in a large particle background ( the antiparticle / particle ratio is of the order of @xmath47 ) .",
    "this drawback is known as _ spillover _ and actually limits the measurements of antiparticle abundances in pamela to about @xmath48 for antiprotons and @xmath49 for positrons  @xcite , in spite of a much larger mdr . for these reasons",
    "the data analysis needs accurate procedures that do not disperse the peculiar characteristics of the detectors .",
    "results from this simulation will be therefore exploited to obtain the best algorithm of position reconstruction depending on the particle incidence angle and on the cluster multiplicity . moreover",
    ", the knowledge of the width of the distribution of residuals in different conditions enables us to `` weight '' each impact point determination while tracking a particle through the spectrometer .",
    "for instance , a high  multiplicity cluster , occurring in a quasi  orthogonal track , is probably connected with a @xmath50 ray emission : so the corresponding position should reasonably have a lower weight in the track fit .",
    "if such a correlation is considered , the accuracy in the momentum reconstruction will be significantly improved .",
    "the simulation described in this paper takes into account the characteristics of the double  sided silicon microstrip detectors of the pamela spectrometer and correctly reproduces their observed performances .",
    "in particular the simulation has been applied to the analysis of the best obtainable spatial resolution as a function of the incidence angle of the incoming particle .",
    "new position finding algorithms ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) have been successfully introduced to improve the resolution for non  orthogonal tracks on the bending view .",
    "the obtained distributions of the spatial residuals at different angles and multiplicities can be used in a simulation of the whole tracking system to study the particle contamination in antiparticle measurements and to calibrate in the best way the tracking procedure ."
