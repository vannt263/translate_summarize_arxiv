    "the near - constant light emission profile of both electromagnetic and hadronic showers and the linear scaling of light output with energy allow the use of such showers as fundamental units of energy reconstruction by scaling the expected light output of a simulated event ( a `` template '' ) to match observed data .",

    "relative timing from the electronics and unfolding is typically accurate to around 1  ns for consecutive non - overlapping pulses on a single dom while the atwd is active .",

    "[ fig : monopod_performance ] , although with a larger population of outliers due to limited vertex resolution .",
    "event selection effects , along with reduced photon statistics , worsen angular resolution at the left near the lower energy threshold of the analysis.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "measurement of the energies of particles producing throughgoing tracks is more complicated than in the case of cascades . at low energies ( @xmath60 ) , the range of muons in ice is short enough that all muon energy is deposited in the detector and a calorimetric approach can be taken . at the higher energies on which this paper is focused",
    ", muons typically have a range longer than the length of the detector .",
    "this presents two immediate complications .",
    "first , the muon s point of origin ( the neutrino vertex for muons produced in @xmath1 interactions ) is unknown for events starting outside the detector and so a measurement of muon energy at the detector can provide only a lower bound on the muon s energy at production , the quantity of interest for reconstructing muon neutrino energies .",
    "second , the muon energy must be estimated only from the properties of the light emitted by the muon during the portion of its track in the detector , in particular the differential energy loss rate ( @xmath61 ) .    above the minimum - ionizing regime ( @xmath4 tev , typical for icecube )",
    ", the average energy loss rate of muons increases approximately linearly with energy @xcite .",
    "energy loss in such events is dominated by stochastic processes such as bremsstrahlung , photonuclear interactions , and pair production involving rare exchanges of high - energy photons @xcite .",
    "the result is that large fluctuations are possible in the amount of energy distributed within icecube even for muons of the same energy .",
    "not all particles of interest are through - going muons : starting muons and taus have energy loss patterns that deviate substantially from the ideal case of constant average energy loss .",
    "muon neutrinos that undergo charged - current interactions inside the instrumented volume have no energy losses before the interaction vertex , followed by a hadronic cascade at the interaction vertex and stochastic losses along the outgoing muon track",
    ". charged - current @xmath62 interactions above @xmath63 can yield taus that travel a detectable distance before decaying , producing a hadronic cascade followed by a track of direct electromagnetic losses from the @xmath3 itself , in turn followed by a cascade or muon from the @xmath3 decay .",
    "the simplest approach to reconstruction of muon energy losses is analogous to reconstruction of cascade energies : finding the best - fit scaling of a template muon to the observed light deposition .",
    "the significant event - to - event variation in muon topologies from large stochastic losses along the track causes bias and poor resolution ( fig .",

    "one approach to track segmentation is to assign each photomultiplier to one of several segments and then use the template - muon method ( eq . [ eq : poissonllh ] ) in each segment @xcite .",
    "this results in several averages taken over sections of the track , allowing the identification of outliers that distort the global average .",
    "typically , these segments are @xmath64 in length , similar to the inter - string spacing in the icecube array . when reduced to differentially small segments , each contains only one pmt ; as they reach the size of the detector the result converges to that from the single - template method .",
    "this approach is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "an overview is given here .",
    "when using spatial separation of the light deposition , the track is divided into bins bordered by planes perpendicular to the track , effectively treating each bin as a separate detector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spatialbinning ] ) .",
    "the light from each pmt in the bin is treated in isolation from the remainder of the detector , and the energy of the track within the bin is determined using a single template muon following the same approach as for an unsegmented muon reconstruction .",
    "is determined using a single template muon as though the photomultipliers in each bin constituted an independent detector . ]",
    "many factors influence the choice of bin size , with the objective to create bins as independent from each other as possible .",
    "icecube uses a sparse grid of photomultipliers with sizable distances between pmts , and each typically observes light from only a limited part of the muon track .",
    "the length of the optimal segmentation depends on the optical properties of the medium and expected correlation scale of the observed light .",
    "this is related to the expected energy of the muons : high - energy muons create more light that travels further through the ice , increasing the scale of correlations between segments .",
    "the typical absorption length for light in the icecube array , averaged over the different optical properties at different depths in the ice sheet @xcite , is @xmath65 .",
    "this is approximately the detector s inter - string spacing and is used as a typical value for the scale of track segmentation in spatial - separation - based reconstruction methods .",
    "variations of muon energy loss can happen at scales much smaller than the usual segmentation scale used in spatial separation .",
    "due to the lack of physical segmentation in the detector , light from single bright stochastic losses can travel distances longer than the size of the segments used and be detected simultaneously with photons from nearer parts of the muon track .",
    "every pmt readout is then a combination of light from everywhere along the track emitted at many places within the detector .",
    "the fact that this combination is linear , and that the individual stochastic losses take the form of electromagnetic showers ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cascades ] ) , makes unfolding these contributions tractable .",

    "we want , however , to incorporate additional physical constraints .",
    "in particular , negative energies are unphysical and should not be present in the solution even though a matrix inversion may often yield solutions with negative terms .",
    "the solution is to use a non - negative least squares algorithm @xcite to achieve a high - quality fit to the data ( fig .",

    "here we use the non - monotonic maximum likelihood ( nmml ) algorithm @xcite , achieving resolution on total deposited energy along muon tracks of @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : millipede_deposition ] ) , comparable to that achieved for deposited energies with cascade events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : monopod_performance ] ) .",
    "additional physical constraints can be included by the use of regularization terms in the likelihood ( eq .  [ eq : millipedellh ] ) .",

    "all the observables discussed here ( total energy loss , mean energy loss rate , truncated mean energy loss rate ) are related to the energy of the underlying muon but are not themselves energies . in order to be able to discuss the resolving power of these observables",
