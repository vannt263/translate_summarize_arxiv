    "the driving current pattern is optimized to drive the mirror with constant speed .",

    "the nominal mirror speed is nearly 0.08 cm sec@xmath24 in optical path difference .",
    "the actual mirror speed has a global trend which is slower at the travel limits ; the variation of the speed is less than @xmath19 5% across the whole travel span .",
    "the amplitude of the mirror speed fluctuation is also less than @xmath19 5% at the nyquist sampling frequency without any disturbance .",
    "the normal sampling rate is nearly five times higher than the highest nyquist frequency , which is helpful for reconstructing the interferograms from the integrated signal . after installing the fis - fts into the akari satellite , a mechanical interference between the mechanical cooler @xcite and the mirror driving mechanism was recognized .",

    "all pixel signals for each detector array are acquired at nearly the same time as the mirror position .",

    "is provided ( see @xcite ) , in which the calibration and the observation sequence are combined with some selectable parameters .",
    "two driving current patterns are prepared for observations ; one supports full travel span for high spectral resolution ( full - res .",
    "mode ) and the other reduces the span to one fourth but enables four times more scans ( low - res .",
    "mode , which is called sed ( spectral energy distribution ) mode ) .",
    "driving speeds are almost the same in both modes .",
    "optical performance of the interferometer is indicated by the modulation efficiency , which is defined as a ratio of the peak value of interferograms at the optical zero position to the constant signal level ( constant part in eq .",
    "( [ eq : interferogram ] ) ) .",
    "the modulation efficiency is primarily affected by two factors ; filter properties and optical alignment .",
    "three polarizing filters are used in the fis - fts ; all the same type of wire grid filter .",
    "the polarizing efficiency was measured for each in the laboratory and is more than 90% for all .",
    "the resulting modulation efficiency due to the three polarizing filters in the mpis configuration is about 80% .",
    "the misalignment of the polarization angle of three filters and ridge angle of roof - top mirrors reduce this efficiency .",
    "since the misalignment of these angles was expected to be on the order of one degree , the effect of the misalignment to the modulation efficiency is negligible ( less than 1% ) .",
    "a major factor affecting the modulation efficiency is the misalignment of optical axes of the two beams , which is generated by the roof - top mirrors .",
    "that is , the opening angle of the roof - top mirrors and the alignment of the tilt angle to the optical axis .",
    "the opening angle of the roof - top mirrors is less than one arcmin from 90 degrees , which was measured in the laboratory at cryogenic temperature .",
    "the remaining misalignment of two beams is due to the tilt of the roof - top mirrors .",
    "the misalignment of the two beam axes can be derived from the interferograms .",
    "if the tilting angles of the two roof - top mirrors are the same , the optical zero will appear at the same time for all pixels .",
    "the actual optical zero for each pixel , however , appear at different times ; there is a delay along the major axis of the detector array . from the measurement of this delay , the displacement angle of the two roof - top mirrors",
    "could be estimated at about 3.5 arcmin in orbit , which corresponds to a misalignment of about 7 arcmin for the two beams .",
    "this value is consistent with the laboratory measurement , and means that there is no degradation in optical alignment due to the launch .",
    "the expected optical modulation efficiency was calculated for several degrees of misalignment .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : mod_efficiency ] , the optical modulation efficiency due to the misalignment of two beams is about 9585% for lw detector and about 8560% for sw detector .",
    "the modulation efficiency can be estimated from the measured signal ratio of the peak value of the interferogram at the optical zero to the dc value , which indicates the total incident power containing both coherent and incoherent components .",
    "due to the transient response of the detectors , however , it is difficult to estimate the actual modulation efficiency from the interferograms . in suction 5",
    ", we discuss the interferometric efficiency of the fis - fts estimated from the derived spectra , which include the detector transient response .",
    "( 80mm,60mm)figure3.eps      ( 80mm,60mm)figure4.eps    image quality , which is a prominent feature of the fis - fts , was evaluated in orbit by observing neptune with the fts optics .",
    "the image of neptune , which can be considered as a point source for the fis instrument , was taken by a scanning observation mode . during the scanning observation ,",
    "the movable mirror is in free motion away from the optical zero position ( @xmath26 0.9 cm in optical path difference ) .",
    "neptune was observed with the same scanning mode with the photometer optics .",
    "the point spread functions ( psfs ) of the photometer are well described by double gaussian profiles , whose parameters are summarized in table [ tbl : fis - fts ] .",
    "the resulting psf of the fis - fts is rather broader than that of the photometer .",
    "the width of the psf along the major axis of the detector array is wider , but there is no significant difference along the minor axis .",
    "this means that there is little affect on the image quality due to the fts optics , i.e. the reflections at the surface of thin film polarizers . on the other hand , due to the misalignment of the roof - top mirrors ,",
    "the image is elongated along the major axis of the detector .",
    "the elongated image of neptune along the major axis of detector is consistent with an image derived from a beam misaligned by 7 arcmin , as described above .",
    "the imaging spectroscopic performance is demonstrated by observations of the galactic center region @xcite , the star forming regions on the galactic plane @xcite , and nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "the fis - fts measures a wide wavenumber region ( 55 - 200 @xmath10 ) at the same time with two kinds of detector array . to produce the whole spectrum of a sky position",
    ", we have to know the alignment of the field of views ( fovs ) of two detector arrays .",
    "the alignment of two arrays was determined from scanning observations of point like sources .",
    "the fovs of two detector arrays are not aligned well on the sky as shown in figure 3 in @xcite .",
    "the overlap region of the fovs for the fis - fts is different from that of the fis photometer , possibly arising from the alignment of the filter wheel .",
    "the smaller overlap region made it difficult to observe point like objects with both the arrays simultaneously .",
    "another factor affecting the image quality is a pixel - to - pixel variation in detector responsivity . during ground measurements of the instrument ,",
    "the aperture lid of the cryostat was observed with the fis - fts as a flat source .",
    "the variations of the integrated signal power were about @xmath19 30% for the sw detector and @xmath19 50% for the lw detector , excluding a few extremely high pixels ( see figure [ fig : flat ] ) .",
    "since pixels of the lw detector were made from discrete chips , in contrast to the monolithic array of the sw detector , it exhibits much larger variations in the integrated signal power , which is coupled with the variation of the spectral response of each pixel . in combination with the internal blackbody source , which is not a flat source due to the influence of the fis - fts optics , we expect to improve the flatness of each detector to about @xmath19 15% and @xmath19 30% for the sw and lw detectors , respectively .",

    "this interferogram still has asymmetrical feature at the optical zero position , which can be clearly seen in the lw detector ( figure [ fig : if_signal](c ) ) .",
    "the distortion of the interferogram comes from the detector transient response ( time is from left to right in the figure ) . due to the difference in the time constant between upward and downward signals , the baseline is decreasing near the optical zero position .",
    "the influence of the distortion of interferograms is discussed in next section .    [",

    "the corresponding fringe pitch in the spectra is about 1.21 @xmath10 ( figure [ fig : fringe](b ) ) , with modulation amplitude significantly smaller than the other fringe seen in the sw spectrum .",
    "the observed fringes are nearly reproduced by a two parallel multi - reflection model with 4.1 mm gap and with about 20% reflectivity .",
    "a plausible explanation of this phenomena is the two blocking filters put on the optical path just after the collimator mirror ( bf#1 & # 2 in figure [ fig : fis_optics ] ) , with a physical gap of about 4 mm .",
    "the fact that this type of fringe can be seen in only sky signals , and not in the internal blackbody source , supports the multi - reflection model due to the blocking filters .",

    "the fis - fts is the first fts operating with an extrinsic photoconductive detector in space .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : if_signal ] , interferograms are distorted by the detector transient response . as the result of the distorted interferogram",
    ", the spectrum has a prominent structure at lower frequency as shown in figure [ fig : if_signal](d)(i ) .",
    "the low frequency component comes from the bump in the baseline around the optical zero position .",
    "it can be clearly seen as the inverse fourier transform of the low frequency component ( see figure [ fig : if_signal](c)(h ) ) . for the nominal operation of the fis - fts ,",
    "the effective wavenumber ranges correspond to the modulation frequency ranges of 3.5 - 7 hz and 7 - 15 hz for the lw detector and the sw detector , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : if_signal](d)(i ) , which are the data of lw07 and sw32 pixels , the real spectrum may be isolated from the low frequency component , which comes from the detector transient response artifact .",
    "the influence of the detector transient effect on the spectra are different from pixel to pixel .",
    "the lw detector has an especially wide variation in the transient response from pixel to pixel .",
    "therefore , the distortion of the real spectrum by the detector transient effect should be evaluated carefully for precise analysis . in the zero order analysis",
    ", however , it may be acceptable to ignore the detector transient effects .",
    "the calibration strategy and accuracy of the fis - fts are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we can derive the interferometric efficiency by comparing the integrated power of the spectrum in the effective wavenumber range with the incident power .",
    "the overall efficiencies are around 50% and 20% for sw and lw detectors , respectively ( open squares in figure [ fig : flat ] ) . considering the optical modulation efficiency ( see [ sss : modulation_efficiency ] ) , the degradation factors due to the detector transient response are @xmath260.7 and @xmath260.25 for sw and lw detectors , respectively . in a future paper , we will discuss the correction of the interferograms in the time domain considering the physical model of the photoconductive detector response .",
    "the operation of the fis - fts , unfortunately , was not optimized for photoconductive detectors because of our poor experience of fts with photoconductive detectors . for future missions , such as spica which is the large infrared telescope mission @xcite , a fts with photoconductive detectors is one of the possible choices for a high performance spectrometer .",
    "to bring out the maximum performance , we have to study the fts with photoconductive detectors and a proper physical model of the photoconductive detector .",
    "the data produced by the fis - fts are quite valuable for this purpose as a precursor mission .",
    "the fis - fts instrument is the first imaging fourier transform spectrometer for far - infrared astronomy operated in space .",
    "the fis - fts was installed as an function of the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) on the akari satellite , which was launched on february 21 , 2006 ( ut ) .",
    "all functions of the fis - fts worked in orbit as well as they did in the laboratory .",
    "the performance of the fis - fts also achieved the same level seen in the laboratory . during the one and half year lifetime of the fis instrument , the total operation time reached more than 200 hours or about 600 sets of pointed observations .",
    "the sensitivity , spectral response and resolution are quite stable for all observations .",
    "a unique feature of the fis - fts is the detector system ; it is the first case to adopt a photoconductive detector array to ftss .",
    "photoconductive detectors have high responsivity on one side , but severe transient response effect on the other side . as the result of this combination ,",
    "the interferograms taken by the fis - fts are distorted and the spectra are affected by the transient response of the detectors .",
    "these difficulties in measuring the spectra should be avoided or reduced in future missions , if adopting a fts with photoconductive detectors .",
    "the fis - fts provides good data for studying the detector transient effects on ftss .",
    "the akari project , previously named astro - f , is managed and operated by the institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) of japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in collaboration with groups in universities and research institutes in japan , the european space agency , and korea .",
    "we thank all the members of the akari / astro - f project for their continuous help and support .",
    "fis was developed in collaboration with nagoya university , isas , university of tokyo , national institute of information and communications technology ( nict ) , national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) , and other research institutes .",
    "optical design of the fis - fts was done with the help of jasco , and mechanical design was done with the technical center of nagoya university .",
