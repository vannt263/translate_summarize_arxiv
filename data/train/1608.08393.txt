    "notwithstanding the long history of studies , the propagation of electromagnetic ( em ) wave inside dielectric media remains an important and rapidly developing topic .",
    "apart from an obvious theoretical value , it finds numerous applications in the designs of the nanoscale photonic and plasmonic devices , structures and metamaterials , such as lasers , spasers , modulators , waveguides , optical switches , laser - absorbers , coupled resonators and quantum wells .    during the past decade",
    "there has been growing interest in studying those systems by means of the formal analogy between maxwell equations in dielectric media and -type equations , dubbed here as the maxwell - schrdinger ( ms ) map @xcite . in this analogy ,",
    "maxwell equations are rewritten in the form of the matrix schrdinger equation , except that the role of time is played by the coordinate along the direction of wave propagation ( usually , @xmath0-coordinate ) , the hamiltonian operator is non - hermitian ( nh ) , and the planck constant is replaced by an effective one @xcite . therefore , a class of the physical systems that allow such mapping is broadly referred as non - hermitian materials and waveguides . moreover , inside this class one can select the subclass of physical systems and phenomena for which the above - mentioned hamiltonian operator has real spectrum , in which case it is called pseudo - hermitian @xcite .",
    "this pseudo - hermiticity manifests itself in various phenomena , such as non - reciprocal light propagation and bloch oscillations @xcite , invisibility and loss - induced transparency @xcite , power oscillations @xcite , optical switching @xcite , coherent perfect absorptions @xcite , laser - absorbers @xcite , plasmonic waveguides @xcite , unidirectional tunneling @xcite , loss - free negative refraction @xcite , and so on .",
    "these processes can be studied using a general theory of pseudo - hermitian ( often referred also as @xmath1-symmetric ) hamiltonians , which has originated from works @xcite , one could mention also the classical results by dyson @xcite .",
    "however , the class of non - hermitian materials and waveguides is obviously much larger than its pseudo - hermitian subclass . indeed , as a result of the interaction of em waves with their environment ( which can be very diverse and uncontrollable ) , the description of their propagation requires the usage of the nh hamiltonians of different kinds , not necessarily possessing real eigenvalues . in other words ,",
    "this propagation must be described within the framework of a general theory of open quantum systems @xcite . according to that theory , for",
    "such situations one needs to engage the full description of the ( quantum ) statistical ensemble of em wave modes . in turn , it requires the usage of the density matrix , instead of a state vector , as a main object of theory .",
    "therefore , ms map must be used to develop the corresponding generalization , which is going to be the main goal of this .",
    "although the density - operator approach for quantum systems driven by nh hamiltonians has been long since known ( see , for instance , the monograph @xcite ) , it has been further developed in the works @xcite . in the current we adapt this formalism for the purposes of describing the em wave propagation inside dielectric materials and waveguides in presence of dissipative effects induced by environment , as well as for extracting physical information and predicting new phenomena .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows . in section [ s - ana ] ,",
    "we provide essential information about the maxwell - schrdinger map for em wave propagation inside dielectric linear media of a general type .",
    "we define the appropriate hilbert space , as well as we introduce notions and representations , which will be necessary for what follows . in section [ s - nhgen ]",
    ", we formulate the density matrix approach for nh dynamics adapted for the ms - mapped models and nh waveguides with dissipation of general type .",
    "we derive a master equation , which governs the statistical behavior of em wave modes inside the medium , and describe its properties . in section [ s - tls ]",
    ", we use the properties of the hilbert space in our case in order to introduce the two - level approach to deriving quantum - statistical observables for any given medium .",
    "this approach reveals more details about physical features of the systems which are being studied , as well as it explicitly illustrates some statistical effects that occur .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in section [ s - con ] .    in this section",
    ", we formulate the formal mapping between certain classes of maxwell and schrdinger equations .",
    "we rigorously derive the effective hamiltonian operator , which describes the propagation of em waves in dielectric isotropic media along a certain direction . due to its generality ,",
    "the approach is applicable for studying em wave propagation inside a very large class of materials where at least one preferred direction of propagation can be established .",
    "let us consider em wave propagating inside a dielectric isotropic linear medium .",
    "for this situation , there are no free charges and currents , therefore , maxwell equations acquire a simple form : & & + t ( ) = 0 , + & & - t ( ) = 0 , + & & ( ) = ( ) = 0 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are electric and magnetic fields , respectively , while the cross and dot denote the vector and scalar products , respectively . here",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 being , respectively , the vacuum permittivity and permeability , whereas @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the relative permittivity and permeability ( complex - valued functions of coordinates , in general ) ; as per usual , one can also express them via the medium s electric and magnetic susceptibilities : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the electromagnetic gaussian unit system s conventions can be used here , as long as the physical vacuum is assumed to be fixed in its current state characterized by the adopted si values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "further , if we align @xmath0-axis with the direction of wave s propagation then , assuming the harmonic time dependence of the electric and magnetic fields , & & ( , t ) = ( x , y , z ) , + & & ( , t ) = ( x , y , z ) , one can decompose them into the transverse and longitudinal ( along @xmath0-axis ) components : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the basis vector along the @xmath15th axis .",
    "one can show that the vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 are essentially two - dimensional : @xmath18 .",
    "correspondingly , maxwell equations take the form ( from now on we adopt the units where @xmath19 ) & & z - e_z + i ( z ) = 0 , + & & z - h_z - i ( z ) = 0 , + & & z ( ) + i e_z = 0 , + & & z ( ) - i h_z = 0 , + & & z ( e_z ) + ( ) = 0 , + & & z ( h_z ) + ( ) = 0 , and also for definiteness we assume throughout the paper that the medium is located at @xmath20 .    the system ( [ e : maxwd ] ) can be recast in the form , in which the equations for longitudinal and transverse vectors are explicitly separated : & & i z z = l_m , + & & i z z = - l_e , + & & e_z = ( i ) ^-1 z ( ) , + & & h_z = - ( i ) ^-1 z ( ) , where we denote the following differential operators : & & l_e = - ^-1 ^-1 , + & & l_m = - ^-1 ^-1 .",
    "using the 2d property @xmath21 , the equations ( [ e : maxwo1 ] ) and ( [ e : maxwo2 ] ) can be written in the matrix form i z = , where we denote the operator = _ 2 = , where @xmath22 is defined in appendix [ a : op ] , and _ 2 = is the auxiliary operator .",
    "a schematic drawing of the em wave propagation as the wave function s evolution along @xmath0-direction is shown in fig . [",
    "f : picgen ] .",
    "furthermore , using the formulas from appendix [ a : op ] , one can check that the operator ( [ e : hamodef ] ) is non - hermitian , even when both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are real - valued .",
    "this holds for either a uniform waveguide type geometry [ fig .",
    "[ f : picwg]a ] or for a more general non uniform geometry [ fig .",
    "[ f : picwg]b ] , as long as the issue of transverse fields vanishing at spatial infinity is properly satisfied , as we will discuss later .",
    "the degree of non - hermiticity of the theory s hamiltonian becomes even larger if we write ( [ e : seprime ] ) in the form that is fully analogous to the  equation , for we must rewrite it in terms of normalized values .",
    "defining an inner product as the integral over what we can call the generalized waveguide s effective cross - section ( _ i.e. _ , the region outside of which the em wave s fields vanish , cf . fig .",
    "[ f : picwg ] ) , one can introduce the normalization factor ^2 d * x * _ ( ||^2 + |",
    "|^2 ) , where @xmath23 would be @xmath24 in cartesian coordinates .",
    "function @xmath25 does not depend on the transverse coordinates but in general it can depend on @xmath26 . with these definitions in hand",

    "( [ e : seprime ] ) acquires the schrdinger equation s form i z = , where we denote the operator & & ( + _",

( [ e : semain ] ) is not merely a rescaled version of eq .",
    "( [ e : seprime ] ) but involves a corrective term , in general . here by @xmath0",
    "we assume the value @xmath31 , and the `` planck '' constant @xmath32 is an effective scale constant of the dimensionality energy@xmath33time , which is introduced for a purpose of preserving the correct dimensionality of the relevant terms in the emergent schrdinger equation ( the ambiguity of @xmath32 is yet another manifestation of the absence of the fundamental length scale in maxwell equations @xcite ) .",
    "following traditions , we will refer to the operator ( [ e : hamto ] ) as the hamiltonian operator of the system , although , strictly speaking , a non - hermitian operator can not be fully regarded as hamiltonian : the anti - hermitian part of such an operator does not correspond to any symplectic structure but rather plays a special role which will be discussed in sec . [ s - nhgen - me ] below .",
    "it should be also noted that in a case when free charges or currents exist in the medium , the original maxwell equations of sec .",
    "[ s - ana - ham ] must be modified , which can result either in a different expression for our analogous hamiltonian or in a breakdown of the maxwell - schrdinger analogy as such . in this paper , we assume such charges and currents to be sufficiently small and consider a leading - order approximation .    furthermore , it should be noticed the appearance of the additional term in the hamiltonian ( [ e : hamto ] ) , @xmath34 which is essentially anti - hermitian and proportional to the identity operator .",
    "due to the latter feature , it belongs to the class of the hamiltonian `` gauge '' terms , which role s discussion will be postponed until sec .",
    "[ s - nhgen - gau ] .",
    "thus , equations ( [ e : ketnorm])-([e : hamto ] ) represent the formal map between maxwell equations for dielectric linear media and the differential equation of the  type , which opens up the possibility of using quantum mechanical notions ( with certain provisions of course ) for the purposes of a theory of em wave propagation inside different dielectric materials , including waveguides .",
    "let us consider now the operator ( [ e : hamodef ] ) .",
    "its hermitian conjugate is given by ^= ^_2 = , where & & l_e^= ^",
    "* - ^-1 , + & & l_m^= ^ * - ^-1 , hence , it is clear that @xmath35 even if the @xmath36-operators are both self - adjoint ( which happens in the case @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which will be discussed in what follows ) , as @xmath39 now appears on the right side of the curl .",
    "the only difference between the case of real - valued @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the general one ( when either or both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are complex ) is that the operator @xmath40 is pseudo - hermitian in the former case and strongly non - hermitian in the latter .",
    "the eigenvalues of a pseudo - hermitian operator are real - valued , whereas the ones of a general non - hermitian operator are complex .",
    "indeed , the case of real @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a special one because then ^= ,   , , such that the following identity takes place ^_2 - _ 2 = ^- = 0 ,   , , which confirms that the operator @xmath40 is pseudo - hermitian with @xmath22 playing a role of the intertwining operator @xcite .",
    "alternatively , using ( [ e : wfnorm ] ) and ( [ e : ketnorm ] ) , one can check that the expectation value of the operator @xmath41 is real - valued when the values @xmath7 and @xmath8 are  since in that case the operator @xmath42 is self - adjoint , cf .",
    "( [ e : hamoddef ] ) .",
    "besides , we can also derive that & & _ 1 = i , + & & ( _ 1 ) ^^_1 = - _ 1 ,   , , + & & _ 3 = - _ 3 = - , such that \\ { _ 3 , } = \\ { _ 3 , _ 2 } = _ 2 = 0 , and = = 0 ,   , .",
    "the last two equations become identities in the case of a diagonal matrix @xmath42 .    for further developments it will be convenient to know the expectation values of the products of operators that involve @xmath40 , as well as their relations to the em fields . using the formulas above ,",
    "we obtain _ & = & d x d y - d x d y + & = & d x d y ( e_[x h_y]^ * + e_[x^ * h_y ] ) - d x d y , + _ 1 _ & = & i d x d y ( ||^2 - ||^2 + ^ * |e_z|^2 - ^ * |h_z|^2 ) , _ 2 _ & = & _ = d x d y ( ||^2 + ||^2 - ^ * |e_z|^2 - ^ * |h_z|^2 ) , + _ 3 _ & = & d x d y + d x d y + & = & d x d y ( e_[x h_y]^ * - e_[x^ * h_y ] ) + d x d y , and ( _ 2 ) _ & = & _ = d x d y ( ||^2 + ||^2 + ^ * |e_z|^2 + ^ * |h_z|^2 ) , and similarly for the adjoint operator : ^_&= & d x d y + d x d y + & = & d x d y ( ^ * e^*_[x h_y ] + ^ * e_[x h^*_y ] ) + d x d y , + _ 1 ^_&= & i d x d y ( ^ * ||^2 - ^ * ||^2 ) - d x d y ( | |^2 - | |^2 ) , + _ 2 ^_&= & d x d y ( ^ * ||^2 + ^ * ||^2 ) - d x d y ( | |^2 + | |^2 ) , + _ 3 ^_&= & - d x d y - d x d y + & = & d x d y ( ^ * e^*_[x h_y ] - ^ * e_[x h_y]^ * ) - d x d y .",
    "it is easy to see that some of these expectation values can be related to the energy density quantities of a wave mode & & _ = _ = ( e_- e_z^ * ) , + & & _ + ( _ 2 ) _ = _ + _",
    "= _ , + & & _ - ( _ 2 ) _ ^ * = _ - _ ^ * = _ z , + & & _ + _ + _ - _ ^ * = _ , where @xmath43 is a differential operator with respect to the frequency parameter , and & & e_z = d x d y (    & & e_= d x d y ( ||^2 + ||^2 ) , are , respectively , the longitudinal and transverse em wave energy densities , such that",
    "_ = e_+ e_z is the total energy density of a mode described by the state vector ( [ e : ketnorm ] ) .",
    "finally , one can add to this list the transmitted power @xmath44 from eq .",
    "( [ e : onemodetpower ] ) .",
    "let us consider the following auxiliary eigenvalue problem : & & l_e e = e , + & & l_m m = m , where the eigenfunctions @xmath45 are 2d vectors obeying the normalization condition d x d y ( |e|^2 + |m|^2 ) = 1 , as well as the boundary conditions",
    " they must vanish either outside the medium or at the transverse spatial infinity @xmath46 .",
    "the auxiliary eigenvalues are in general complex - valued functions of @xmath26 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , which also depend on the parameters inside the functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "they can become real - valued in some cases , e.g. , when the permittivity and permeability are both real - valued . in the latter case ,",
    "both @xmath36-operators become self - adjoint , therefore , this eigenvalue problem reduces to that of the sturm - liouville type .",
    "thus , the total hilbert space of our theory can be represented as a direct sum of the function space of the eigenvectors @xmath45 .",
    "these spaces store , separately from each other , all electric and magnetic components of em wave modes , which are allowed by imposed boundary conditions .",
    "their union space thus contains the information about energy transfer between electric and magnetic components for each mode , see appendix [ a : op ] for details .",
    "below in sec .",
    "[ s - tls - rea ] , we will see that the auxiliary eigenvalues @xmath51 have distinct behaviors compared to the familiar eigenvalues of helmholtz - type equation and their dispersion relations show the physics of waves under a different light .",
    "further , in this representation , the operators ( [ e : hamodef ] ) and ( [ e : hamoddef ] ) take the form & = & = _ 3 + , + & = & _ 2 = i _ 1 + _ 2 , where = ( ) , therefore , the total hamiltonian ( [ e : hamto ] ) becomes & = & _ 2 - i + & = & ( i _ 1 + _ 2 - i ) + & = & i ( _ - - _ + - ) , where @xmath52 .",
    "thus , in this representation the hamiltonian becomes a 4@xmath334 matrix consisting of 2@xmath332 blocks .",
    "what we have done in the previous section is merely a way of rewriting maxwell equations for waves in dielectric media in the schrdinger form ( [ e : semain ] ) . in this section",
    "we will proceed with an important generalization : we go beyond those equations and adapt the quantum - type density matrix approach @xcite for describing the propagation of em waves inside dielectric media .",
    "this will allow us to describe not only separate wave modes ( `` pure states '' , in quantum - mechanical terminology ) or their superpositions ( `` entangled pure states '' ) but also their statistical ensembles ( `` mixed states '' ) .",
    "the latter are crucial for introducing the dissipative effects since the purity of the states is not necessarily preserved in presence of dissipative environments @xcite .",
    "more details will be given in sec .",
    "[ s - nhgen - me ] below , here we only note that one should not confuse our approach with the loudon microscopical qed - type quantization of light in presence of matter @xcite , nor our approach is directly related to the nyquist - callen(-rytov ) approach to thermal fluctuational electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the quantum - type statistics of wave modes we are going to introduce here is an effective phenomenon which emerges due to existence of the maxwell - schrdinger map and associated quantum - type dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the main difference of the proposed approach from the standard non - hermitian quantum - statistical one @xcite is that the role of the time variable is played here by the third coordinate , @xmath31 . in other words , instead of time evolution of quantum states",
    "the method will describe the distribution of em wave energy along the propagation axis .",
    "this , however , does not pose much difference from the technical viewpoint , and most of concepts can be borrowed and applied for the purposes of the em theory .      to begin with ,",
    "if a hamiltonian is a non - hermitian operator , then it can be decomposed into its hermitian and anti - hermitian parts , respectively : = _ + + _ - = _ + - i , where we use the notations _ ( ^ ) = _ ^ , and the hermitian operator i _ - = ^ is usually dubbed the _ decay operator_. for instance , for the hamiltonian ( [ e : hamto ] ) one easily computes that & & _ + = _ + = ( _ 2 + ^_2 ) , + & & = + = ( _ 2 - ^_2 ) + , where we assume the notations from the previous section .",
    "this decomposition means that within the total system , described by @xmath54 , one can single out the hermitian subsystem , described by @xmath55 , whereas the operator @xmath56 can be regarded as describing the energy exchange of this subsystem with its environment . the question of whether the system @xmath54 itself can be a subsystem of a more general , hermitian , system , is not considered here , since it would bring us outside the scope of this paper .",
    "the quantum - statistical approach means here that the `` evolution '' ( distribution along the propagation direction ) of such a system is described by the ( reduced ) density operator , which contains information not only about superpositions of the em wave modes but also about the statistical uncertainty of their distribution inside a medium .",
    "such uncertainty can be caused , for instance , by the interaction of the wave with its environment , which usually happens inside realistic dielectric media .",
    "an example would be the thermal randomness that arises in the statistical mixture of large numbers of em wave modes , each with a certain classical probability , switching from one to another due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "in such cases , unpolarized light ( `` mixed state '' ) appears , which is in fact not the plain superposition of single modes ( `` pure states '' ) , but their statistical ensemble .",
    "thus , the density matrix contains all the information necessary to calculate any measurable property of polarized or unpolarized radiation propagating inside realistic media with or without dissipation .",
    "besides , one of its advantages is that for each mixed state there can be many statistical ensembles of pure states but only one density matrix .    in our case",
    ", a density operator has a few distinctive features when it comes to its interpretation .",
    "firstly , it is a reduced density operator which means that environment s degrees of freedom have been averaged out , one deals only with their cumulative effect upon the subsystem described by such a density operator .",
    "furthermore , the hilbert space of the hamiltonian ( [ e : hamto ] ) has a block structure where one block corresponds to a set of all electric components of em wave modes and other block does to all magnetic ones , see sec .",
    "[ s - ana - ev ] .",
    "thus , the off - diagonal @xmath57th components of the density matrix describe the transition between the electrical component of @xmath58th mode and magnetic component of @xmath15th mode , where indexes belong to different blocks , whereas the diagonal components are related to integral energy measures of either electrical or magnetic components of a single mode , see sec .",
    "[ s - nhgen - ave ] , eqs .",
    "( [ e : decompom ] ) , ( [ e : decomprho ] ) , and appendix [ a : op ] .",
    "an equation for the density matrix can be directly derived from any equation that has the  form , see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite . using eq .",
    "( [ e : semain ] ) , one can show that our nh system is fully described by the so - called non - normalized density operator @xmath59 , which is defined as a solution of the operator equation of the liouvillian type , [ e : densnonnorm ] = i ( ^- ) = - i - \\ { , } , where square and curly brackets denote the commutator and anti - commutator , respectively .",
    "one can see that , as @xmath0 varies , the trace of @xmath59 is not conserved , @xmath60 where we denoted = tr ( ) , therefore , @xmath59 describes a case when subsystem s integrity will eventually be completely broken  either through the complete decay ( @xmath61 vanishes at large @xmath26 ) or critical instability ( @xmath61 blows up at large @xmath26 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the subsystem gets destroyed very fast , usually at an exponential rate .",
    "this is definitely not what always happens in reality , therefore in ref .",
    "@xcite we introduced the operator = / tr , which is automatically normalized ( the physical meaning of this procedure will be discussed later ) , therefore , it can be used for computing expectation values , correlation functions and other observables .    in principle , in eq .",

    "( [ e : eomrho ] ) is both nonlocal and nonlinear with respect to the density operator @xmath62 .",

    "a theory with the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath54 is dual to a theory with the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath67 but with the modified evolution equation , which thus becomes the master equation of a special kind .",
    "this equivalence not only reveals new features of the dynamics driven by non - hermitian hamiltonians but also facilitates the application of such hamiltonians for open quantum systems @xcite .    from the viewpoint of theory of open quantum systems , the equation for the non - normalized density operator",
    "@xmath59 effectively describes the subsystem represented by the hamiltonian @xmath55 with the effect of environment represented by @xmath68 .",
    "if the `` evolution '' ( energy distribution along @xmath26 direction ) is governed by @xmath59 , which trace is not preserved , then this subsystem `` eventually '' ( at some value of @xmath26 ) becomes critically unstable or disappears .",
    "thus , the post - selecting procedure ( [ e : rhonorm ] ) can be interpreted as follows : in order to maintain the probabilistic interpretation of @xmath62 ( as well as to ensure that the subsystem exists at every point @xmath0 ) , one must neglect the amount of the energy that is not associated with the original subsystem @xmath55 anymore .",
    "consequently , the equation for the normalized density operator @xmath62 effectively describes the subsystem @xmath55 together with the effect of environment @xmath68 and the energy flow between this subsystem and environment .    to summarize , the normalized @xmath62 and non - normalized @xmath59 density operators describe , at a given hamiltonian and initial and boundary conditions , two types of em wave evolution .",
    "the former operator applies if the wave s evolution is knowingly _",
    "sustainable _ ; in this case the operator @xmath59 contains the information about the above - mentioned energy flow between the system and environment , which can be extracted using auxiliary techniques ( such as the entropy , see sec .",
    "[ s - nhgen - entr ] below ) . if the normalized density operator does not exist or it has unphysical properties ( _ e.g. _ , singularity at some value of @xmath26 ) then one is left with the _ non - sustainable _ evolution described solely by the operator @xmath59 .",
    "the choice between these types of evolution is dictated by the physical context : it depends on values of hamiltonian s parameters as well as on boundary and initial conditions for master equations , which specify one or another configuration .",
    "obviously , any liouvillian - type dynamics implies that the equations for density operators must be supplemented with initial conditions . in our case ,",
    "a few subtle points exist that must be taken into account .",
    "first , since the role of time is played by the @xmath26-coordinate here , the initial condition at the surface @xmath69 is , strictly speaking , a boundary condition .",
    "for example , it is convenient to choose this surface to be the interface between a medium and the rest of space , which is orthogonal to the propagation direction .",
    "thus , the choice must be dictated by geometrical properties of the material layout .",
    "the second subtlety is that , in our case , we have two possible types of evolution , described by two equations  for the non - normalized @xmath59 and normalized @xmath62 density operators  equations ( [ e : densnonnorm ] ) and ( [ e : eomrho ] ) , respectively .",
    "however , it is eq .",
    "( [ e : densnonnorm ] ) , which must be solved in the first place in both cases , therefore the corresponding initial / boundary condition at the surface @xmath69 must be specified as    automatically obtain |_= _ 0 = _ 0 / _ 0 , according to eq .",
    "( [ e : rhonorm ] ) .",
    "note that from a physical point of view , the condition ( [ e : doinigen ] ) is not equivalent to @xmath70 since the operator @xmath71 does not necessarily have a unit trace , hence fixing its trace s value would require invocation of additional physical considerations .",
    "the third subtlety arises when dealing with pure states , _",
    "i.e. _ , states whose density matrices @xmath72 obey the idempotency condition @xmath73 .",
