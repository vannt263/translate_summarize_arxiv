    "the failure of perturbative method and the limitations of traditional non - perturbative approaches makes it difficult to study strongly correlated systems .",
    "lattice field theory@xcite , is an effective method to study the static equilibrium at high temperature and low density , but requires very high performance computational techniques .",
    "however , with the introduction of ads / cft correspondence by maldacena@xcite the situation turns favorable .",
    "the correspondence relates @xmath0 super yang - mills ( sym ) conformal field theory in four - dimensions with the type _ ii b _ string theory on @xmath1 spacetime .",
    "the generalisation of this conjecture known as gauge / gravity duality or holography and is used to obtain many significant results about the thermodynamical and hydrodynamical aspects of strongly coupled systems using their weakly coupled gravity dual@xcite . using the classical gravity solutions in the bulk",
    ", we can study holographic theory for the gauged system on the boundary .",
    "these observations further leads to the development in understanding of various phenomena like phase transition , hall effect , nerst effect and other experimentally observed properties in a strongly correlated condensed matter systems@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the optical conductivity of a 1 + 1 dimensional system using its gravity dual btz black hole in 2 + 1 dimensions@xcite in the soft wall model@xcite . this system has been investigated recently@xcite and the transport properties",
    "have been studied both numerically and analytically using charged scalar field coupled with the gauge field in the gravity action .",
    "the objective of our work is to calculate the transport properties of the system in much simpler form using soft - wall model@xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that different dilaton profile corresponds to different condensates for the system .",
    "although , in this present work we have not investigated the phase transition explicitly , but the pattern for the optical conductivity indicates the metallic phase for 1 + 1 dimensional system . using the soft wall model ,",
    "first we investigate the optical conductivity for the chargeless black hole .",
    "then , the real and imaginary part of the optical conductivity are obtained for different value of the chemical potentials in the ` no wall ' model by eliminating the dilaton background in front of the ricci curvature in the action @xcite .",
    "let us consider the soft wall model in 2 + 1 dimensional einstein - maxwell system given as , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is field strength of u(1 ) gauge field @xmath4,@xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the three dimensional newton s constant ) and @xmath7(cosmological constant)@xmath8 ( taking l=1 which is a ads length scale ) .",

    "@xmath25    here we have studied two different models for the dilaton profile , model i @xmath26 and model - ii @xmath27 for studying the 1 + 1 dimensional system in the probe limit . since it is believed that the dilaton profile is emerging from the condensation of the scalar field , the two different shapes are analogous to the type - ii and type - i coherence factors of the holographic superconductor @xcite .",
    "the numerical results of the optical conductivity using equation ( [ eq : gauge ] ) has been shown in fig.1 .",
