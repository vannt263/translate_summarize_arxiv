    ", we compared several samples of emission lines found automatically to those found by an intensive , spectra by spectra , visual inspection and found the automated method did not miss any significant fraction of lines ( @xmath75% ) .",
    "the parallel nature of the wisp observations presents several challenges to emission line extraction .",
    "foremost is the lack of dithering , which greatly complicates the mitigation of cosmic rays , hot or warm pixels , and other artifacts . as a practical matter",
    ", this means that the automated line identification process has a very high contamination rate from false and/or spurious sources .    to address the false detections we require the visual inspection of every candidate emission line by two team members , done independently and without consultation . after this initial inspection ,",
    "we compare the emission line lists from the two reviewers and send each reviewer back a list of discrepancies , allowing them to make a second , more careful examination of any emission lines for which there is a disagreement .",
    "this exercise provides a good final agreement for most emission lines , but we find that for roughly 5% of the emission lines , consensus can not be reached .",
    "these uncertain lines are removed from the final sample , but are accounted for in our completeness corrections ( see section [ completeness ] ) .",
    "the visual inspection consists of examining both the extracted one dimensional and the original two dimensional spectra , as well as the continuum fits and measurements of signal - to - noise .",
    "there are only four conditions for which we exclude a candidate line :    \\1 ) if the line is clearly an artifact , either a cosmic ray , a zero order image from a nearby bright source , a diffraction spike , ghost , or some other artifact clearly not associated with the spectrum in question .",
    "\\2 ) if the continuum fit under the location of the emission line is highly inaccurate , artificially increasing the significance of the emission line .",

    "\\3 ) if the local noise variations are larger than the flux uncertainties used by the automated line identification software , measuring lines at a higher significance than local noise conditions actually warranted . while the wfc3 detector and grism are fairly uniform and well - behaved , we find variations across the detector and locations where what appear to be non - poissonian sources of noise exist . in these cases",
    "the automated recovery pipeline was likely to find every noise peak and call it a source .",
    "\\4 ) if the contamination from nearby overlapping spectra is so great that we can not determine what source is producing the emission line .",
    "however , in most cases even severe overlapping source contamination can be untangled .",
    "we use multiple lines spread across the g102 and g141 grisms ( only the real source produces the correct wavelength ratios in those cases ) , small pixel offsets from source center , and discrepancies between the size of the object and the spatial extent of the emission line as evidence for assigning the confused emission line to its proper source .",
    "only if the source remains ambiguous after all analysis is it excluded from the final sample .",
    "objects with both and [ oiii ] emission are included within both distributions and can be approximated as the region where the two distributions overlap ( there are only 2 @xmath8@xmath71.5 [ oiii ] emitters without a detection).,width=336 ]    [ zdist ]    single emission lines are assumed to be , except in the few rare circumstances where the single line is clearly resolved into the [ o iii ] 5007 + 4959   doublet .",
    "our simulations indicate that this is a good assumption and does not result in more than 6% of our lines being actually misidentified [ oiii ] ( see section [ contam ] below ) .",
    "however , this assumption does have a large effect on the recovery of high redshift ( z@xmath11.5 ) [ oiii ] lines , requiring some additional completeness corrections for those emission lines ( see section [ o3completeness ] ) .    in total , we extracted 1960 emission lines from the 29 fields down to a typical flux limit of 3 - 5@xmath210@xmath3 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 . for an emission line galaxy to be included in our final analysis",
    "we also require an observed equivalent width greater than 40   ( log ew = 1.6 ; see section [ completeness ] below ) and a signal - to - noise greater than 5 for at least one of the detected emission lines , creating a final sample size of 1048 galaxies . of these ,",

    "the overlap where we found both and [ oiii ] in the same galaxy is 226 .",
    "virtually all surveys suffer incompleteness from objects lost as the strength of their signals approaches the level of the noise .",
    "a slitless grism survey , like wisp , also suffers significant incompletenesss due to confusion from nearby bright sources .",
    "in addition to those two fundamental sources of incompleteness , emission lines can also be lost as part of the extraction methodology .",
    "these sorts of failures include objects missed by the automatic line finding routine , objects removed due to redshift confusion , and objects incorrectly rejected by visual inspection . in order to derive final completeness corrections to account for all the forms of incompleteness that effect the grism data",
    ", we must simulate the entire line extraction process from beginning to end .",
    "we start with the generation of a set of emission line galaxy models , covering the full range of redshifts ( @xmath8=0.3 - 2 ) , brightnesses ( 19 - 26 f110w mag ) , spatial extent ( 0.2 - 1radius ) , and equivalent widths ( 20 - 2000  ) found in our wisp data set of emission line galaxies .",
    "we have used two different spectral templates extracted from the kinney - calzetti atlas in the stsdas / synphot library .",
    "the spectra are from real starburst galaxies observed over the whole uv and optical range up to 1 .",
    "we have chosen two spectra with relatively flat continuum in @xmath20 and different line ratios of /[oiii ] @xmath21 4.3 and 0.75 .",
    "the size of the galaxies were then simulated using random values of the minor and major axis defined as the fwhm of light profile in the sextractor catalog . throughout this paper",
    "any reference to galaxy size or galaxy radius always refers to the size of the direct ( f110w ) image and not to the spatial extent of the emission lines seen in the grism spectra .",
    "we place each model galaxy randomly into one of our actual pairs of wisp g102 and g141 grism images using the axesim software @xcite , before extracting it using the same methodology and pipeline as used for extracting all the real emission line galaxies .",
    "this means that first we identify the lines using the automated software and then two separate team members visually examine each spectrum to ensure it contains a real emission line . during the visual inspection we mix 15 model galaxies along with another 15 randomly chosen galaxies , such that the reviewer could not assume that each spectrum must contain a visible emission line .",
    "overall we insert 923 model galaxies ( 74 fields each with typically 10 - 15 model galaxies ) and , including the random galaxies , extract twice that number .",
    "we find that the primary determinants of completeness for the emission line galaxy sample are the observed equivalent width ( ew ) and the line flux of the emission line . in practice",
    ", the latter translates to the signal - to - noise of the emission line flux measurement , as the background noise varied from field to field by a factor of 4 .",
    "we also find completeness had some dependency on the radius ( here defined as the major and minor axis determined by sextractor averaged in quadrature ) of the source galaxy , but that this is of secondary importance due to relatively small number of large ( @xmath1 0.75 ) radius galaxies in the observed sample , approximately 0.5% ( see section [ oiii_ratio ] for further discussion of the size of emission line galaxies ) .    in figure 1 , we plot completeness as a function of these three parameters ( line flux s / n , ew , and size ) , where each bin is a combination of recovery rates for the model galaxies .",
    "we weight all the model galaxy recovery rates for each single parameter by the frequency in which galaxies with the other two parameters appear in our full sample of actual emission line galaxies .",
    "we acknowledge that these observed frequencies of the different galaxy parameters are not the absolute true frequencies .",
    "however , the implied differential numbers of `` missing '' emission line galaxies due to incompleteness are not large enough to make a significant impact on the final derived incompletenesses , so we weight by the observed parameter frequencies in the interest of simplicity . for instance , if the full sample has twice as many small ew objects as large ew objects , model galaxies with small ews will be given twice the weight when deriving completeness for s / n or size .",
    "one immediate result from this simulation is that the recovery rate drops rapidly from 60% to @xmath720% as the observed ew (  ) of the emission line becomes less than 40   ( log ew = 1.6 ; see figure 1 ) . in the rest frame of our @xmath81 galaxies",
    ", this ew limit corresponds to 20  , roughly two thirds that of the average ew for spiral galaxies in the local volume @xcite and approximately equivalent to the average ew for the most massive @xmath8=0.8 - 1.5 galaxies ( 11@xmath7log m@xmath22@xmath711.5 ) identified by 3dhst @xcite . in the interest of not introducing extremely large ( @xmath1 5 ) and uncertain completeness corrections to the number counts",
    ", we apply a cut of ew @xmath1 40   to all of our analysis . after combining this ew cut with our requirement that all detected emission lines have a signal - to - noise @xmath1 5 ,",
    "the total number of model galaxies is 553 . of those model galaxies",
    ", we recovered 380 , yielding an approximate recovery rate of 69% .",
    "we note that for this combination of equivalent width and signal - to - noise , there are effectively no galaxies fainter than 25 magnitudes ( as measured at f110w - band , although the simulated galaxies are flat in f@xmath23 ) in the final sample we use for our analysis .    in figure 2 , we present emission line ew as a function of signal - to - noise for both observed and model emission - line galaxies .",
    "one can see that the model galaxies span the same parameter range as the real galaxies , extending farther to brighter lines with large ews and fainter lines with smaller ews in order to test how our sample completeness acts at these extremes .",
    "one complication is that over a significant portion of the redshift range ( @xmath8=0.7 - 1.5 ) , there are actually two strong emission lines , [ oiii ] and . in some cases [ oiii ] is the more powerful line , particularly as we go to fainter line fluxes ( see section [ oiii_ratio ] below ) .",
    "we therefore used model templates both where is more powerful and ones where [ oiii ] is the stronger emission line ( /[oiii ] = 0.75  4.3 ) .",
    "we plot the redshift distributions for the detected and [ o ii ] emitters in figure [ zdist ] .",
    "the gap in the distribution around @xmath8=0.8 is a result of the low signal - to - noise wavelength range edges of the g102 and g141 grisms where they overlap at 1.11.2 @xmath13 m .",
    "one would expect a source with multiple lines to have a higher completeness than a single line source with the same line flux and ew . therefore to determine the likelihood of identification",
    ", we measure the combined signal - to - noise of both lines , add them quadratically , and use that total signal - to - noise for calculating our completeness . for the combined ew",
    "we use a simple sum of the two emission lines .",
    "we plot these combined values of signal - to - noise and ew as blue stars in figure 2 , along with the single line cases of ( red triangles ) and [ oiii ] ( green squares ) . in most cases",
    "one line is clearly stronger , so the final signal - to - noise used for the completeness correction can usually be approximated as the signal - to - noise of just the brightest emission line .",
    "we do not use the other , weaker emission lines ( [ oii ] , [ sii ] , , etc . ) for determining completeness , as these lines are never alone and their relative fluxes are almost always small compared to and [ oiii ] .",
    "we find that for even the highest signal - to - noise lines ( s / n @xmath1 100 ) , we reach only 90 - 95% completeness .",
    "the main reason for this is contamination , either from overlapping spectra or large , bright objects in the direct images used to identify the galaxy counterparts .",
    "either the line is lost under an extremely bright spectrum ( most fields have 3 - 5 moderately bright h@xmath719 objects ) , the object lies in a complicated region where we are unable to determine which of the nearby , overlapping objects to associate with the emission line , or the contamination from overlapping sources has caused the automatic line finder to fail , i.e. , sextractor fails to find the source or the continuum fit fails badly .",
    "altogether contamination from nearby sources explains about 75% of line extraction failures .",
    "most nearby source contamination issues would be resolved if data could be taken at two or more roll angles , such that the spectra do not overlap , but that is not an option for parallel programs .",
    "another reason a strong line will fall out of our sample is if the two emission line reviewers can not come to consensus on the redshift of the object ( 10% of the bright extraction failures ) , which most commonly occurs where it is unclear whether the line is or [ oiii ] .",
    "for instance , when a source is spatially extended the grism wavelength resolution is effectively lowered , making it difficult to distinguish between the [ oiii ] doublet and a single emission line .",
    "this sort of confusion almost never occurs in g102 ( r210 ) , suggesting that data taken with a higher spectral resolution would largely solve this problem as well .",
    "the remaining 15% of bright emission line failures are mostly miscellaneous extraction errors by the visual line inspectors .        in figure 4 ,",
    "we plot the final completeness corrections used for all of our analysis , derived as a function of both the equivalent width and the signal - to - noise of the line flux .",
    "while the object size also has an effect on whether an emission line galaxy will be recovered , we found that accounting for galaxy size has little effect on the overall completeness corrections , as the largest galaxies make up only a tiny percentage of the sample , @xmath72% , even after accounting for their higher incompleteness . or to put it another way , galaxy size is not very important to the overall completeness correction , because size completeness corrections grow larger as the actual number of galaxies is decreasing , unlike ew or line flux , where the number of objects tends to grow just as their completeness corrections are significantly increasing .",
    "a three parameter completeness correction is also not practical for the required double visual inspection of each suspected emission line . each added parameter increases the human workload geometrically . instead , for each bin of ew and line flux signal - to - noise , we weight the input model galaxies by the frequency that each galaxy size appears in our observed sample list of emission line galaxies .",
    "generally we found that the completeness corrections we derived for can also be applied to [ oiii ] emission lines .",
    "while [ oiii ] is a doublet with a distinctive line profile that one might expect could be more easily disinguished from artifacts and noise , for low signal - to - noise and small ews where the incompleteness becomes increasing important , [ oiii ] becomes indistiguishable from a single emission line .",
    "this assumption that and [ oiii ] completeness can be treated the same breaks down for [ oiii ] at redshifts of @xmath241.5 .",
    "this is a result of the attribution of all single line emitters to .",

    ", the emission line is redshifted out of our detectable wavelength range , so we lose the ability to confirm [ oiii ] with the usually brighter line . if the [ oiii ] line is bright enough we can still identify it from its doublet line profile , but the faint [ oiii ] lines will all be identified as lower redshift lines by default .",
    "while this misidentification of high - z [ oiii ] produces only a small contamination of ( see section [ contam ] ) , our simulations show we lose nearly 50% of our high - z [ oiii ] emission lines because of our inability to resolve the doublet .",

    "modeling of baryonic acoustic oscillations suggests that the redshift accuracies required for such an experiment are more like 0.1% @xcite , which is also the requirement for both the _ euclid _ and _ wfirst _ missions .",
    "however , it is important to recall that the wisp redshifts are a combination of two different near - infrared grisms ( g102 and g141 ) with two different resolutions ( r210 and r130 ) . if we split the redshift accuracy histograms by the grism from which it came , we find the higher resolution grism reaches accuracies of 0.13% ( as opposed to 0.19% in g141 ) , demonstrating that 0.1% redshift accuracy is possible if the wavelength resolution r @xmath1 200 .",
    "it is important to note that the lack of sub - pixel dithering of the parallel observations prevents any meaningful resampling of pixels along the direction of the wavelength dispersion .",
    "such resampling would provide a small improvement in the overall wavelength resolution and would therefore also potentially increase the redshift accuracies that are possible .      identifying emission lines in grism spectroscopy fields without dithering or field rotation is a challenging task .",
    "even the well - behaved wfc3 near - infrared arrays still have cosmic rays , hot pixels , and other phenomena that can mimic real emission lines .",

    ", we track whether an emission line galaxy is detected and placed into our final emission line list . there is no requirement that input and output redshifts must match . a mismatched redshift indicates contamination . while an emission line was found , it is clearly not identical to the emission line that was input .",
    "we label all extracted simulated spectra with a difference between input and output ( 1+@xmath8 ) of more than 1% as contamination .    of the 364 simulated emission lines that meet all extraction criteria ( s / n @xmath1 5 , ew @xmath1 40  ) , 312 are good emission lines found at the input redshift , a successful extraction rate of 85.7% .",

    "there are no alternative emission lines with which they could be associated , so they are contamination of non - emission lines to the sample .",
    "that gives us two contamination rates for our sample : 8.5% contamination by false emission lines and 14.3% total contamination rate of emission lines by the combination of [ oiii ] and false emission lines .",
    "these contamination rates are similar to the 15 - 30% contamination rates found for narrow band searches @xcite , although we note that additional information ( e.g. , galaxy colors , photometric redshifts , and especially the use of a second narrow band filter ) can reduce the narrow band contamination rate down to 5% @xcite .",
    "this false emission line contamination rate decreases slightly as we increase the cut - offs of either equivalent width or signal - to - noise of the line fluxes , but contamination rate never improves to much less than 10% .",
    "for instance , whether we raise the equivalent width cut - off from 40   to 200   or raise the the signal - to - noise line flux cut - off from 5 to 20 , the false emission line contamination rate drops by only 3.5% , to 10.8% total contamination .",

    ". this single line discovery rate could potentially be as high as 80% if all the lower limits presented actually lie within the single line discovery region .",
    "we can also look at a sample where the redshift is @xmath8@xmath11.2 , as that would better reflect the range over which [ oiii ] would be detectable if the lower wavelength cut - off is the 1.1 cut - off of _ euclid _ rather than the 0.85  of the wisp survey .",
    "the number of bright emitters is much smaller ( 12 ) but the percentage of expected single line emitters , 6783% , is virtually the same as when we included the lower redshifts emitters .",
    "our analysis assumes all the single emission lines are , which we know to be incorrect roughly 10% of the time . therefore it is possible that approximately 3 of the 31 single line emitters in that flux range could be low /[oiii ] sources ,",
    "although if their true redshifts are greater than @xmath45 then their fluxes and /[oiii ] ratios are not constrained .",
    "it is important to emphasize that of the 25 sources with bright fluxes where we detect both and [ oiii ] , _ none _ of them have /[oiii ] @xmath7 1 .",
    "there is no obvious reason why we would be missing all the galaxies with low /[oiii ] from 0.7@xmath7@xmath8@xmath71.5 , unless the ratio is so low that we lose the ability to detect .",
    "however that would require an unlikely large gap in the /[oiii ] ratio , making all galaxies either strong or strong [ oiii]-emitters , with none in between .",
    "regardless of the exact quantity of contamination from single line [ oiii ] emission , clearly /[oiii ] @xmath7 1 sources are much rarer at the bright fluxes that future near - infrared grism missions will probe than in our fainter sample .",
    "therefore the assumption that all single line emitters are should produce very few contaminating interlopers for these space missions , although further data is required to better establish exactly what the [ oiii ] contamination rate is .",
    "the trend of increasing /[oiii ] ratio with flux is a result of the known correlation between the /[oiii ] ratio and luminosity previously reported by wisp @xcite .",
    "their analysis also indicates that dust extinction increases with luminosity , meaning that dust extinction is suppressing [ oiii ] emission more at the bright luminosity end .",
    "however , the trend of stronger relative [ oiii ] with fainter luminosity is far stronger than their measured effects of extinction .",
    "the dominant determinant of the /[oiii ] ratio is most likely the metallicity , as the [ oiii ] 5007  / ratio strongly correlates with metallicity in the local universe ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "metallicity is known to correlate with mass and luminosity @xcite , so it is not surprising that the brightest emitters , which tend to be the most luminous in the continuum as well , would also have higher /[oiii ] ratios .",
    "another possible reason for the enhancement of [ oiii ] could be the presence of agn , although its effect on the /[oiii ] ratio would be at least somewhat mitigated by the similar enhancement of [ nii ] , which can not be disentangled from at the wisp wavelength resolution .",
    "however , line ratios from wisp stacked spectra are more consistent with the low - metallicity tail of a star - forming region than that of an agn @xcite .",
    "this agrees with @xcite , who found @xmath8=0.84 -selected samples contain only 5 - 11% agn .",
    "@xcite suggests the agn fraction does increase with redshift , but remain only 15% of the -emitters above @xmath8@xmath11 , with the biggest increases in agn contribution at the brightest luminosities .",
    "while it is likely that some of the galaxies with the smallest /[oiii ] ratios are agn , they do not appear to make up enough of the total population of -emitters to have a significant effect on the overall trend of increasing /[o iii ] ratio with flux .      using the total volume densities derived for each luminosity bin ( see section 4.1 ) we are able to plot luminosity functions in figure [ halumfun ] and table [ lumfunpoints ] .",
    "we have split the emission line luminosity function into two redshift ranges , 0.3@xmath7@xmath8@xmath70.9 and 0.9@xmath7@xmath8@xmath71.5 .",
    "we chose to split the sample at @xmath8=0.9 as that divides the detected emission lines by the grism with which they were detected ( the dividing line between g102 and g141 is @xmath211.2 ) , which also has the added benefit of producing roughly even sample sizes ( 436 0.3@xmath7@xmath8@xmath70.9 versus 517 0.9@xmath7@xmath8@xmath71.5 ) .",
    "we make no correction for dust extinction , but there is a correction factor of 0.71 applied to the luminosities to account for [ nii ] contamination .",
    "please note that before directly comparing these luminosity functions to the cumulative counts from section [ emissionline ] , the [ nii ] contamination correction must be removed .",
    "our best - fit schechter parameters are presented in table [ schechter ] .",
    "generally we find that the 0.9@xmath7@xmath8@xmath71.5 luminosity function is comparable at the faint luminosity end to luminosity functions measured by the previous nicmos grism studies @xcite .",
    "however , the wisp number densities drop more quickly as the luminosities become brighter , dropping well below the bright luminosity number counts from previous nicmos surveys by logl=42.5 . while many of the earlier nicmos surveys are too small in area for accurate counts at the bright end of the luminosity function @xcite , the @xcite luminosity function plotted here is derived from an area roughly comparable ( 104 arcmin@xmath0 ) to the wisp data presented in this work . with more than 139 different fields",
    "spread across the sky , the expected cosmological variance for @xcite is also low ( @xmath72% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it can not explain the observed difference either . finally , the redshift sampling difference ( 0.7@xmath7@xmath8@xmath71.4 with nicmos versus 0.9@xmath7@xmath8@xmath71.5 with wfc3 ) is not sufficiently different to effect the luminosity function comparison .",
    "the majority of deviation between the two luminosity functions comes down to a single bin at logl=42.7 , so the observed luminosity function difference may simply be a result of an unfortunate 2 - 3 @xmath35 deviation at that single point .",
    "we also find our 0.9@xmath7@xmath8@xmath71.5 number densities to be consistent with the @xmath8=1.47 number densities derived from the narrow band surveys @xcite .",
    "however , the redshifts sampled by @xcite ( at @xmath8=0.84 and 1.47 ) straddle the sampled range of our high redshift sample ( median redshift of @xmath8=1.15 ) , so if all the luminosity functions were consistent , then the wisp luminosity function ought to lie between the two @xcite distributions .",
    "that the number densities at @xmath8=1.47 and our median @xmath8=1.15 instead overlap suggests that the wisp grism survey may be finding slightly more line emitters than the narrow band survey , although the absolute differences are very small .",
    "alternatively , the evolution in the luminosity function between @xmath8=0.8 and @xmath8=1.5 could be occurring mostly at the low end of that redshift range , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the hizels data sample down to very similar ews ( 25  ) , so that is not a likely source of the difference .",
    "neither data sample has made any attempt to remove agn , so that can not be a source of difference either .",
    "there is some difference in the extraction apertures used .",
    "hizels uses a fixed 2@xmath17 aperture at @xmath8=1.47 , while wisp uses a varying aperture of twice the object size in the direction perpendicular to the wavelength dispersion ( there is effectively no limit to the size of line emission detectable along the dispersion axis ) .",
    "however , the majority of objects are compact enough that it seems unlikely either extraction methodology could be missing much flux .    our lower redshift 0.3@xmath7@xmath8@xmath70.9 sample ( median @xmath8=0.58 )",
    ", on the other hand , does fall below the @xcite narrow band @xmath8=0.84 number counts , as well as the @xmath8=0.8 narrow band counts ( not plotted ) from the newfirm survey @xcite , although the difference at the bright end of the luminosity function is within the errors .",
    "the more consistent low redshift luminosity densities suggest that the wisp survey is not generally finding line emitters at a higher rate than narrow band surveys , but only for its higher redshift bin .",
    "a single minor inconsistency such as this could be partially explained by cosmological variance , which is expected to be on the order of 15% @xcite for the @xmath8=1.47 @xcite narrow band sample .",
    "a significant strength of the wisp survey compared to narrow band studies is the relatively small contribution of cosmological variance to the overall error budget .",
    "first , the large difference in redshift depth ( @xmath46z = 1.2 for wisp versus @xmath46z = 0.02 for a typical narrow band ) means that despite covering a much smaller area of sky ( e.g. , 130 arcmin@xmath0 versus 1 - 2 deg@xmath0 ) , the wisp survey actually covers a comparable amount of volume .",
    "for instance , a single wisp pointing covers roughly 10@xmath47 mpc@xmath48 ( @xmath8=0.31.5 ) , while the @xmath8=0.84 and @xmath8=1.47 narrow band samples of @xcite cover 10@xmath47 mpc@xmath48 over 210 and 100 arcmin@xmath49 respectively .",
    "the 29 fields used in this paper survey a volume of nearly 3@xmath210@xmath50 mpc@xmath48 , roughly equivalent to 1 deg@xmath0 of the @xmath8=1.47 narrow band of @xcite .    secondly , pencil beam studies like wisp , which cover a small area over a large redshift range , have significantly lower cosmological variance than a similar cubical or spherical volume , as the the long , narrow window must pass through many different environments while a regularly shaped cube could potentially lie right on top of an extreme overdensity @xcite . for objects with a density of 10@xmath28 mpc@xmath28 ,",
    "the cosmic variance is only 12% for a single wisp pencil beam while it is nearly 60% for @xmath8=0.85 and @xmath8=1.47 narrow beam samples covering the same volume @xcite .",
    "of course , the total areas covered by the @xcite narrow band surveys are 6 - 20 times larger ( 1 - 2 deg@xmath0 ) from two separate fields , reducing their associated cosmological variance to 15 - 20% . however , as the wisp fields are widely separated on the sky , the cosmological variance from field to field is uncorrelated , reducing the cosmological variance of the total sample by the square root of the number of fields . for our example of 10@xmath28 objects per mpc@xmath48 ,",
    "the contribution of cosmological variance to the wisp sample presented in this paper is only 2% .",
    "we have included cosmological variance in our calculations of total errors for the luminosity functions , although its contribution is essentially negligible compared to the poissonian uncertainty and completeness correction errors .",
    "we note that while a deep pencil beam study like wisp has the advantage of very little cosmological variance because of the large redshift range observed , it does so by sacrificing the ability to sample the behavior of galaxies at more discrete redshifts . in effect , it blurs all the evolutionary effects that take place within each redshift bin .",
    "this averaging of galaxy evolution is not a significant issue if the evolution over the sampled redshift range is taking place at a steady , predictable pace , but could be misleading if the galaxy behavior changed particularly rapidly or became strongly non - linear . of course , if the evolution becomes too rapid or unpredictable , narrow band surveys risk completely missing significant behavior that happens to fall between their sampled redshifts .",
    "because of this , deep pencil beam grism and narrow band surveys are actually complementary , each a check on the potential weaknesses of the other .",
    "regardless of how our sample selection may differ from other surveys , we can robustly compare how the luminosity function evolves within the wisp survey as we use the same methodology for selection and completeness corrections .",
    "it appears that most of the evolution from @xmath510.3 - 1.5 takes place at the bright end of the luminosity function . within the errors",
    ", the luminosity functions are converging below logl=41 .",
    "however , with only two low luminosity bins for the high redshift sample , this low luminosity covergence is not definitive .",
    "generally it appears that most of the evolution in from @xmath8=0.31.5 is taking place in l@xmath10 , which is consistent with previous findings @xcite .",

    "we would therefore strongly recommend that future near - ir missions keep to wavelength resolutions above r@xmath1200 . * * contamination from overlapping spectra from bright sources , * which effects even bright , high signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "it alters the measured continuum , impacts the effectiveness of automatic line finding algorithms , makes it difficult to identify the correct host galaxy and emission line wavelength , and results in emission lines that are lost altogether .",
    "roughly 5% of all our bright lines ( @xmath13@xmath210@xmath6 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 ) are lost to overlapping bright source contamination .",
    "the use of multiple roll angles would greatly minimize these effects , particularly for the brighter , less densely - packed sources mostly being targeted by future missions . * * lack of dithering , * which not only greatly impacts our ability to mitigate cosmic rays , hot and warm pixels , and other artifacts that can mimic emission lines , but also prevents us from recovering the additional resolution that sub - pixel dithering can provide .",
    "with grism spectroscopy , this results in not only improved spatial resolution , but also improved wavelength resolution , which helps to address the insufficient wavelength resolution issue already discussed above .    while wisp is sensitive to emitters down to @xmath8=0.3 , both _",
    "euclid _ and _ wfirst _ will likely have low wavelength cut - offs around 1.1 making them mostly sensitive to emission line galaxies at @xmath8@xmath10.7 .",
    "we find that our cumulative number of galaxies at 0.7@xmath7@xmath8@xmath71.5 reaches 10,000 deg@xmath9 by an flux of 2@xmath210@xmath6 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "-emitting galaxies with comparable [ o iii ] flux are roughly five times less common at these ( 1 - 3 @xmath210@xmath6 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 ) emission line fluxes .",
    "as emission line fluxes become fainter the /[oiii ] ratio becomes smaller , largely a result of the correlation between the /[oiii ] ratio and luminosity previously reported by wisp @xcite .",
    "while great numbers of /[oiii]@xmath71 emission line galaxies can be found around 5@xmath210@xmath3 ergs@xmath4 @xmath5 , there are effectively none in our sample once the flux becomes greater than 2@xmath210@xmath6 ergs@xmath4 @xmath5",
    ". these large /[oiii ] ratios for the brighter emission lines suggest that 60 - 80% of the emission lines found by future space missions will be single lines .",
    "however , that same high /[o iii ] ratio suggests that the likelihood of contamination by lines besides remains low .",
    "our luminosity function finds a similar number density of line emitters to that of the nicmos near - infrared grism surveys at faint luminosities , but finds significantly fewer numbers of line emitters ( factors of 3 - 4 less ) at the bright luminosity end .",
    "we find our 0.9@xmath7@xmath8@xmath71.5 number counts to be consistent with the @xmath8=1.47 narrow band survey of hizels ( sobral et al .",
    "2013 ) , although with our lower median redshift @xmath8=1.15 , we would have expected slightly lower densities if the luminosity function is smoothly evolving out to @xmath8=1.5 . on the other hand ,",
    "our lower redshift 0.3@xmath7@xmath8@xmath70.9 -emitter number counts fall just below both the narrow band counts from hizels at @xmath8=0.84 and newfirm at @xmath8=0.8 .",
    "the absolute difference in expected luminosity density for the higher redshifts is small and could be partially a result of cosmological variance of the narrow band sample .",
    "the [ oiii ] emission line probes a higher redshift range than and is therefore not sensitive to the fainter luminosities required to properly constrain @xmath11 . if we fix @xmath11=-1.5 , as seen in studies at lower redshifts , we find that the evolution in the [ oiii ] luminosity function from @xmath8=0.72.3 is almost entirely in the l@xmath10 parameter , similar to what we observe for the @xmath8=0.31.5 evolution of the luminosity function .",
