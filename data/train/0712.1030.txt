    "kilometer - size ground - based interferometric detectors of gravitational radiation have become operational at several laboratories around the world @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . from locations in the united states of america , italy , germany , and japan , these instruments have started to search , in the kilohertz frequency band , for gravitational waves emitted by astrophysical sources such as spinning neutron stars , supernovae , and coalescing binary systems .    among the various sources of gravitational radiation that these instruments will attempt to observe , coalescing binary systems containing neutron stars and/or black holes",
    "are expected to be the first to be detected and studied .",
    "these signals have a unique signature that enables them to be extracted from wide - band data by digital filtering techniques @xcite .",
    "this signature is their accelerating sweep upwards in frequency as the binary orbit decays because of energy loss due to the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "coalescing binaries have a potential advantage over other sources in signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) by a factor that depends on the square - root of the ratio between the corresponding number of cycles in the wave trains @xcite .",
    "the standard technique used for extracting these `` chirps '' from the noisy data is called matched filtering . in the presence of colored noise , represented by a random process @xmath0",
    ", the noise - weighted inner product between the data stream @xmath1 recorded by the detector and the gravitational waveform template @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 where the symbol @xmath4 over @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes their fourier transform , @xmath7 is the one - sided power spectral density of the noise @xmath0 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the limits of the frequency band of interest , and the @xmath10 represents complex conjugation . from this definition",
    "the expression of the snr can be written in the following form @xcite @xmath11 by analyzing the statistics of the @xmath12 , it is possible to make statements about the presence ( or absence ) of such a gravitational wave signal in the data .",
    "this operation of course needs to be performed over the entire bank of templates over which the snr statistics is built upon , since a gravitational wave signal is in principle determined by a ( finite ) set of continuous parameters .",
    "the effectiveness of the matched filtering procedure relies on the assumption of exactly knowing the analytic form of the signal ( possibly ) present in the data .",
    "recent breakthroughs in numerical relativity @xcite have started to provide a complete description of the radiation emitted during the inspiral , merger , and ring - down phases of generic black hole merger scenarios .",
    "although the ability of obtaining numerically all the templates needed in a data analysis search ( perhaps hundred of thousands of them ) might be practically impossible , in principle we should be able to compare these numerically derived waveforms against various analytic templates obtained under different approximating assumptions .",
    "work in this direction has already started to appear in the literature @xcite within the so called `` frequentist framework '' , in which estimates in the reduction in snrs and inaccuracies of the determination of the parameters characterizing the signal , due to the use of approximated waveforms , have been derived .",
    "depending on the magnitude of these degradations one can decide whether to use these approximated waveforms as templates in a data analysis search .    since it can be argued that contiguous pn approximations should well characterize the differences between the `` true signal '' present in the data and the highest - order pn approximation , in this paper we perform such a comparison within the bayesian framework .",
    "an analogous , frequentist analysis has recently been performed by cutler and vallisneri @xcite for the case of super massive black holes binaries observed by lisa ( the laser interferometer space antenna ) .",
    "their approach relied on the use of the fisher - information matrix , which is known to give good results in the case of large ( hundreds to thousands ) snrs . in the case of ground - based interferometers instead ,",
    "since the expected snrs will be probably smaller than @xmath13 , a parameter estimation error analysis based on the fisher - information matrix would lead to erroneous results @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will estimate the loss in probability of detection ( i.e. loss of _ evidence _ of a signal to be present in the data ) as a function of the snr in the following two cases : ( i ) the true signal present in the data is a spin - less pn3.5 waveform and the search model is represented by a spin - less pn3.0 , and ( ii ) the true signal is a spin - less pn2.0 waveform and the model is a spin - less pn1.5 waveform .",
    "we have limited our analysis to these two separate cases in order to cover the region of the pn approximations that have already , or are in the process of , being used in the analysis of the data collected by presently operated ground - based interferometers .",
    "our approach relies on a bayesian markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique , as mcmc methods have successfully been applied to a large number of problems involving parameter estimations @xcite in experimental data sets . in our analysis",
    "the chirp signals ( the one present in the data and the one used as the model ) are characterized by five parameters : the two masses of the system , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , their time to coalescence @xmath16 , the coalescence phase @xmath17 , and their distance @xmath18 from earth .",
    "bayesian mcmc methods have already been proven to be capable of estimating the five parameters of a pn2.0 chirp signal embedded into noisy data of a single interferometer when using a pn2.0 based model @xcite , and in a coherent search in the time domain for nine parameters using a pn2.5 model @xcite and a pn3.5 model @xcite for the phase .",
    "however , it has never been shown before how the resulting evidence and probability distributions of the parameters are affected by the usage of different pn models . here",
    "we will estimate the evidence of a signal being buried in noise and , at the same time , derive the probability distribution of its parameters when the gravitational wave form of the model is a simplified version of the signal present in the data .",
    "a bayesian analysis naturally justifies occam s razor @xcite due to the penalization of unreasonably complex models by the integration over the parameter space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secii ]",
    "we provide a brief summary of the bayesian framework and its implementation in our problem . after deriving the expressions of the likelihood function and the priors for the parameters searched for , in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] we describe the markov - chain monte carlo sampling technique adopted for calculating the posterior distributions .",
    "we then specify in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] the different simulations we have conducted by introducing the wave forms , noise specifications , and parameter sets .",
    "the final results of our simulations are presented in sec .",
    "[ secv ] , displaying the mcmc based posterior distributions for the parameters and involved models .",
    "the estimated posterior probabilities of the models are presented as a function of snr with the corresponding uncertainties over the noise realizations .",
    "we find that the difference in detection probability when using a simplified model rather than the true one is negligibly small in comparison to these uncertainties .",
    "the posterior credibility regions of the parameters reveal offsets from the true parameter values that can be much larger than the statistical uncertainty , for both the pn1.5/2.0 and pn3.0/3.5 model comparisons .",
    "the pn2.0/2.0 and pn3.5/3.5 comparisons on the other hand , always yield credibility regions that cover the true parameter values . finally , in sec .",
    "[ secvi ] we provide our comments and concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we will derive the bayesian full probability model for our problem , which involves the comparison between the two possibilities of having either a signal and noise or just noise in the data .",
    "this requires the determination of the likelihoods , the prior distributions for the parameters associated with the models , and the resulting posterior distributions .",
    "let us suppose we observe a data stream @xmath19 containing the instrumental noise @xmath0 and a chirp signal @xmath20 that we will regard as the `` _ _ true _ _ '' signal . here",
    ", @xmath21 is the vector representing all the parameters associated with the signal , and the noise is assumed to be a stationary gaussian random process of zero mean . in the fourier domain the observed data can equivalently be written as @xmath22 ( where tilde denotes the fourier transform operation ) and we will refer to this expression as model @xmath23 .    in what follows we will assume the `` _ _ true _ _ '' signal @xmath24 to be the gravitational wave emitted by a coalescing binary system and represented by a spin - less post - newtonian approximation in phase and newtonian in amplitude for which @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the masses of the rotating objects , @xmath16 is the coalescence time , @xmath18 the absolute distance to the binary system , and @xmath17 the phase of the signal at coalescence .",
    "we will then describe the detection and estimation of the parameters of the `` true '' signal by relying on a spin - less lower - order post - newtonian waveform , @xmath26 .",
    "this simpler model will be referred to as model @xmath27 .",
    "the derivation of the detection probability implies a comparison between model @xmath27 and the null - model , which postulates mere noise @xmath28 within the data .",
    "this model will bereferred to as model @xmath29 .",
    "note that no parameter enters into this model .",
    "since we have assumed the distribution of the random process associated with the noise of the detector to be gaussian of zero - mean , it follows that the likelihood function is proportional to the exponential of the integral of the squared and normalized residuals between @xmath30 and signal template @xmath31 over the frequency band of interest @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "we define the data @xmath33 to be modeled by @xmath34 with its `` _ _ true _ _ '' parameter vector @xmath35 .",
    "the comparison with the simplified model @xmath36 , results in the following expression for the likelihood function @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the one - sided power spectral density of the noise .    by substituting @xmath39 into eq .",

    "note , that the investigation of this question requires to do the two different model comparisons separately , i.e. @xmath29 vs. @xmath36 and @xmath29 vs. @xmath34 @xcite .    the next step needed for completing our bayesian full probability model",
    "is the identification of suitable prior distributions for the five parameters characterizing the chirp signal .",
    "our derivation will closely follow that described in @xcite .",
    "the derivation of appropriate priors @xmath43 bears significant influence on the evidence of a signal presence within noise , since the prior identifies the size of the parameter space which the evidence is based on .    a detailed description of the derivation of the prior distributions , and in particular for the masses @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and distance @xmath18 , can be found in @xcite . in short ,",
    "the masses are assumed to be uniformly distributed over a specified range , @xmath44 $ ] , and the prior distribution for the distance is chosen to be a cumulative distribution of having systems out to a distance @xmath45 smaller than @xmath18 , @xmath46 , proportional to the cube of the distance , @xmath47 . in order to obtain a proper prior distribution that does not diverge once integrated to infinity , it is down - weighted by including an exponential decaying .",
    "this accounts for the malmquist effect @xcite and includes the assumption of uniform distribution for the masses .",
    "the resulting distribution function @xmath48 can be written as follows @xcite @xmath49}(m_1)~i_{[m_{min},m_{max}]}(m_2)~r^2 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\cdot \\left ( 1 + \\exp \\left ( \\frac{\\log \\mathcal{a}-a}{b}\\right ) \\right)^{-1 } \\label{priorm1m2d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51}(m)$ ] is the so - called `` indicator function '' , equal to @xmath52 when @xmath53 and zero elsewhere .",

    "since this model postulates mere noise , there are no parameters entering the likelihood , which is therefore a constant .",
    "the final remaining step in defining the bayesian procedure is to assign prior probabilities to the models themselves . since we have no a priori knowledge , the unbiased choice is equal probability for each .      by applying bayes theorem using the likelihoods and priors",
    "defined above , we then derive the multidimensional posterior probability distribution for the model and its parameters @xmath70 where @xmath71 corresponds to the two models @xmath72 . in the same way ,",

    "a bayesian analysis naturally justifies occam s razor @xcite due to the penalization of unreasonably complex models by integrating over the parameter space resulting in the preference for a simpler model .",
    "there exist various techniques for tackling this multi - dimensional problem .",
    "one possible approach is to calculate the so called bayes factors @xcite , which are the ratios of the global likelihoods of the models that are involved .",
    "the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) @xcite can be used as an approximation to the bayes factor .",
    "however , it is possible to address the problem of sampling from the multidimensional posterior distribution in eq .",
    "[ posterior ] by implementing a relatively new procedure , called reversible jump mcmc ( rjmcmc ) technique @xcite , which simultaneously addresses the problems of model selection and parameter estimation .",
    "the rjmcmc is combined with traditional fixed dimension mcmc techniques that sample from the parameters of the current model . in the following",
    "we will briefly review the mcmc algorithm that we will use in our analysis .      in simulated tempering @xcite ,",
    "the `` temperature '' becomes a dynamic variable on which a random walk is conducted during the entire sampling process .",
    "the joint distribution of temperature and remaining parameters , however , requires the normalization constants of the distributions given the temperature .",
    "other approaches like the tempered transition method @xcite or the metropolis - coupled chain ( a.k.a . parallel tempering algorithm ) @xcite do not need normalization constants .",
    "the latter approach has been advocated in the astrophysical literature @xcite and it has also been implemented in @xcite .    in a metropolis - coupled chain @xcite , sampling is done in parallel from @xmath73 different distributions @xmath74 .",
    "the real posterior distribution of interest is denoted by @xmath75 with parameter vector @xmath76 , whereas the distributions of higher orders @xmath77 are chosen in such way that the sampling process is facilitated . usually , different temperature coefficients are applied @xcite that flatten out the posterior modes . during the sampling from the @xmath73 distributions , from time to time",
    ", attempts are made to swap the states of a randomly chosen pair of distributions .",
    "the posterior in the present context can be regarded as a canonical distribution @xmath78 where @xmath79 with inverse temperatures @xmath80 . for higher values of @xmath81 ,",
    "the posterior modes are flattened out and the sampling process is eased .",
    "a temperature scheme for our metropolis - coupled chain uses @xmath82 different @xmath83 values with @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the temperature of the original posterior distribution . as in @xcite ,",
    "the prior distribution is purposely not involved in the temperature scheme as the prior information at high temperatures is preserved .",
    "[ temperaturescheme ] converges to the prior distribution if @xmath86 whereas a temperature scheme , had it been applied to the entire posterior distribution , would merely yield a uniform distribution .    the inverse temperatures @xmath80 are unknown parameters that must be determined prior to each simulation .",
    "it is obvious that the highest temperature needs to account for the nature of the likelihood surface .",
    "the stronger the signal , the higher the modes and the more likely it becomes for the mcmc sampler to get trapped .",
    "the acceptance probability of a proposed jump in a basic metropolis - hastings algorithm is determined by the product of the ratios between the proposals , the priors , and the likelihoods @xcite of the proposed parameter vector and current state parameter vector . for a coarse assessment of the nature of the posterior surface",
    ", we can neglect the prior distribution as it is much smoother than the likelihood surface . with symmetric proposals ,",
    "the likelihood ratio is therefore the key factor in analyzing the depth of the modes in the posterior surface .",
    "although in the simplified model comparison the parameter estimates can be far off the true parameter values , in the true model comparison the true parameter values are expected to be good estimates of the parameters .",
    "this fact can be used for a coarse assessment of the nature of the likelihood surface .",
    "since the log - likelihood of the true model at the true parameter values is @xmath87 , it can be compared to the log - likelihood of the null - model @xmath88 .",
    "the probability to overcome a proposed mcmc jump between these two likelihood values determines the convergence of a mcmc sampler .",
    "the acceptance probability is therefore related to the difference of the log - likelihoods @xmath89 .",
    "we want the hottest temperature to allow jumps within the posterior surface and we want this to happen about every , say , @xmath90 iterations . this number allows occasional jumps at the hottest temperature ( smallest inverse temperature ) which is therefore chosen to be @xmath91 we then use an exponential temperature scheme for @xmath82 chains : @xmath92    for each iteration and each chain , new parameter values are proposed .",
    "of course this is only meaningful when the current state of the chain is not the null - model .",
    "if the present state of the sampler is model @xmath36 ( or @xmath34 depending on the comparison ) , independent normal distributions are chosen to propose new jumps .",
    "pilot runs are first used to find appropriate proposal variances . the acceptance probability for a proposed candidate",
    "is derived by computing the metropolis - hastings ratio @xcite .",
    "the proposed swaps between arbitrary pairs of chains are done in the way described in @xcite with the temperature scheme highlighted above .",
    "the transdimensional jumps between null - model @xmath29 and model @xmath36 ( or @xmath34 ) are conducted by rjmcmc steps @xcite .",
    "we implemented a death and a birth proposal which either attempts to jump from model @xmath36 ( or @xmath34 ) to model @xmath29 or from model @xmath29 to model @xmath36 ( or @xmath34 ) .",
    "the reversible jump approach requires a random variable @xmath93 with distribution @xmath94 that matches the dimensions of the parameter space across models .",
    "in addition , a function is defined that does the dimension matching . in the present case",
    "it is a function based on death and birth events .",
    "the one - to - one transformation in the birth transition creates a new signal with parameter vector @xmath95 and has the form @xmath96 . the inverse death transformation that annihilates the signal , @xmath97 , has form @xmath98 .",
    "the jacobian of both transformations is equal to @xmath52 .",
    "the acceptance probability for the creation process is therefore @xmath99 where @xmath100 is drawn from @xmath94 .",
    "the annihilation process is in turn given by @xmath101 where @xmath95 is the parameter vector of the current existing signal .",
    "since we chose equal prior probabilities for both models , we have @xmath102 .",
    "as one can see in eq.[accprob01 ] , for the creation process , the prior distribution @xmath103 at an existing parameter @xmath95 is found in the enumerator while the proposal distribution @xmath104 at the existing parameter is present in the denominator . on the other hand , in eq.[accprob10 ] , for the annihilation process , the proposal value @xmath105 of a new proposed parameter vector @xmath100 is found in the enumerator while the prior @xmath103 is in the denominator .",
    "this means that a larger parameter space , which naturally yields smaller prior values , results in more likely accepted deaths than accepted births . as a consequence ,",
    "the sampler will prefer sampling from the null - model which means that the evidence of a signal will be smaller if we increase the parameter space .",
    "this makes perfect sense as we expect the evidence of a signal to fade if we integrate over a larger parameter space .",
    "the other fact that the proposal distribution enters on opposite sides of the fraction in eq.[accprob01 ] and eq.[accprob10 ] reveals the difficulty on the choice of the proposal distribution . in order to understand the effect of the proposal distribution ,",
    "let us consider the following three scenarios    1 .",
    "suppose we do not know the major posterior mode and therefore choose the parameter vector of a new signal to be drawn from a wide spread proposal distribution .",
    "we could choose the proposal distribution to be the same as the prior distribution , in which case prior and proposal would cancel out .",
    "from the sampling point of view , the samples would account for the prior distribution and the acceptance probability would merely contain the likelihood .",
    "however , it would be unlikely to find the narrow mode in the likelihood surface by ineptly poking around in the entire parameter space restricted by the prior .",
    "such a rjmcmc sampler would rarely accept jumps between the models .",
    "only very long runs would give sufficient information about what proportion the sampler naturally stays in which model in order to draw reliable conclusions .",
    "suppose we wrongly assume the posterior mode to be concentrated in some area of the parameter space far away from the actual posterior mode .",
    "we would choose the proposal distribution to have the major probability in some wrong area of the parameter space .",
    "naturally the draws from such distribution would privilege proposals in the wrong area of the parameter space but the acceptance probability would repress births and support deaths in the area as the proposal values would be naturally high .",
    "the sampler is balanced but mixing would be poor as proposes in the correct area of the parameter space are rare , even though their acceptance would be facilitated",
    ". the mixing would be even worse than in the first scenario and even longer runs would be needed to reveal reliable information about how long the sampler naturally stays on average in which model .",
    "suppose we have a vague idea about where the major posterior mode is located and choose our proposal density to be centered around that area .",
    "the samples would be drawn preferential in that particular area of parameter space but the ratio of proposal and prior would compensate for that in the acceptance probability .",
    "however , the likelihood ratio in this area would have a major impact and the sampler is more likely to jump between the models revealing the proper ratio and model probability in a much shorter sampling period .",
    "we see that the choice of a proper proposal distribution is very important .",
    "a good proposal distribution ought to have the major probability mass concentrated around the expected posterior mode but with long tails in order to cover the entire prior .",
    "this is achieved by a mixture distribution between a normal distribution with small variance and a uniform distribution that covers the prior range",
    ". if we are to compare the null - model @xmath29 and the true model @xmath34 , we are in a lucky position .",
    "the mean of the proposal distribution is most likely to be found around the true parameter values and we only need to find a variance in the same order of magnitude as the posterior mode which can be determined by pilot runs .",
    "things are different when we compare null - model @xmath29 and the simplified model @xmath36 .",
    "the posterior mode can not be expected at the true parameter values as the wave form of the simplified model is definitely not best fit at the true parameter values .",
    "just augmenting the variance of a proposal distribution with mean at the true parameter values would result in bad mixing .",
    "we therefore need pilot runs at higher signal - to - noise ratio in order to determine the vague center of the posterior mode in the simple model case .",
    "the information acquired from such runs serves to determine a suitable proposal distribution .",
    "the sampling process of the individual chains when the current state of the markov chain is in the model that postulates a signal , is done by a common mh step @xcite .",
    "the proposals here is tailored to the expected posterior shape by choosing a very heavy tailed distribution .",
    "this was accomplished by mixing a normal distribution with exponentially varying variance @xcite .",

    "since the time required to perform a single - signal simulation was several days on the jet propulsion laboratory dell xeon cluster ( running 1024 intel pentium 4 xeon processors ) , we decided to perform only three simulations for three different binary systems .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results seen in these tables show that the mass function , @xmath161 , and the time to coalescence , @xmath16 , are the parameters that are most biased when estimated with a simplified model .",
    "note , first of all , that in all cases , the true values fall into the 95% credibility intervals when the estimation is based on the true model . for the distance @xmath18 and the chirp mass @xmath162",
    "the 95% credibility intervals cover the true values in all comparisons .",
    "however , when applying a simplified model , the 95% credibility interval of the mass function @xmath161 does not cover the true value in three cases : \\{b1:pn1.5/2.0 , b2:pn1.5/2.0 , and b2:pn3.0/3.5)}. in the case of the time to coalescence @xmath16 , we find instead four cases : \\{b2:pn1.5/2.0,b2:pn3.0/3.5,b3:pn1.5/2.0,b3:pn3.0/3.5}. combining these cases , we have a total of 5 out of the 6 simple model comparisons ( pn1.5/2.0 and pn3.0/3.5 ) that fail to retrieve all their parameters within the 95% credibility region . the only simple model comparison that yields 95% credibility intervals that overlap all the true parameter values is b1 : pn1.5/2.0 ,",
    "although this is only marginal .    in summary , we see that the bias in the estimated parameters based on a simpler model is larger than the statistical uncertainty . however , we should note that the snr we have been considering corresponds to the value at which the posterior detection probability just reaches the value of one . since the statistical error is a monotonically decreasing function of the snr",
    "while the bias is not , we conclude that the difference between statistical and systematic error increases for larger snrs .",
    "these results reveal that parameter estimates based on simplified models are not very reliable , since the systematic error is higher than the uncertainty of the posterior distribution .",
    "furthermore , the use of higher order post newtonian wave forms does not abate this problem , as it has been shown in fig .",
    "[ figb2 ] .",
    "we have shown that , within the bayesian framework , the probability of detection is not impeded by using a simplified model for detecting wave forms of higher pn order in the low - snr regime .",
    "the bayesian approach provides the means to gain insight into the variation of the detection probability over different noise realizations .",
    "we have shown that the difference between the posterior detection probabilities corresponding to the true and the simplified model is very small as compared to its variance over different noise realizations .",
    "we have further shown that the systematic error in the bayesian estimates , on the other hand , can be larger than the statistical uncertainties .",
    "this is also in agreement with results obtained within the frequentist approach , discussed in the literature by others @xcite .",
    "however , it is based on finding the best fit of the involved wave forms while in our bayesian framework an integration is performed over the entire posterior distribution which implies detection and estimation simultaneously .",
    "we can therefore analyze the posterior distributions , conditioned on the model that involves a signal which provides us with credible estimates in the low - snr regime .",
    "we find that the estimates of @xmath161 and @xmath16 based on simplified models need to be taken with caution in both the pn1.5/2.0 and in the pn3.0/3.5 case as the offset is unpredictable .",
    "the only parameter that is accurately recovered throughout our simulations is the distance @xmath18 which is clear as it only appears in the amplitude term and is not affecting the phase evolution of the signal . the chirp mass could also be retrieved within the 95% credibility intervals but yet shows a visible offset . with increasing snr , however , the statistical error becomes smaller while the systematical offset remains constant .",
    "given these findings we conclude that post newtonian approximations , regardless of order , can be precarious for detecting `` true '' gravitational wave forms .",
