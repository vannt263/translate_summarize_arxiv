    "recently there have been extensive studies on cooperative , relay  based transmission schemes for extending cellular coverage or increasing diversity .",
    "several basic relaying transmission techniques have been introduced , such as amplify - and - forward ( af ) @xcite , decode - and - forward ( df ) @xcite and compress - and - forward ( cf ) @xcite .",
    "these transmission techniques have been applied in one- , two- or multi - way relaying scenarios .",
    "in particular , two  way relaying scenarios @xcite have attracted a lot of attention , since it has been demonstrated that in these scenarios one can apply techniques based on network coding in order to obtain a significant throughput gain .",
    "there are two basic principles used in designing throughput ",
    "efficient schemes with wireless network coding :    1 .",
    "_ aggregation of communication flows _ :",
    "instead of transmitting each flow independently , the principle of network coding is used in which flows are sent / processed jointly ; 2 .   _ intentional cancellable interference _ : in analog network coding , flows are allowed to interfere , knowing _ a priori _ that the interference can be cancelled by the destination .",
    "the motivation for this work was to generalize the two basic principles from above and devise novel transmission schemes in multi - user scenarios .",
    "we consider scenarios based on cellular networks with relays , where direct and relayed users are served in uplink / downlink .",
    "assume for example that a direct user wants to send a packet to the base station ( bs ) , while the bs has a packet to send to a relayed user .",
    "in a conventional cellular system , these packets are sent over separate ul / dl phases . instead , the bs may first send the packet which is received at the relay station ( rs ) . while the rs forwards this packet to its",
    "intended relayed user , the direct user sends its packet to the bs , thus saving the required transmission time compared to the conventional method .",
    "we term such a scheme _ coordinated direct / relay ( cdr ) _ transmission scheme .",
    "transmission schemes that are related to some of the schemes proposed in this paper have appeared before in the literature  @xcite , or to relayed users @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we have used the principles described above to generalize the transmission schemes to in total four transmission schemes , which represent a superset of the existing schemes . as in the case of wireless network coding ,",
    "our schemes take advantage of the combining of uplink and downlink traffic flows .",
    "furthermore , we consider multi  user ( @xmath0 ) scenarios , in which the proposed cdr schemes are used as building blocks for creating novel scheduling schemes .",
    "we consider the rate  optimal scheme , which requires exhaustive search across the pairs of users and is complex .",
    "therefore , we propose several suboptimal schemes and the results show that they perform closely to the optimal one , while all the proposed schemes show significant rate gains with respect to the reference system in which the cdr schemes are not employed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ system model ] describes the system model for two - user and multi - user networks .",
    "the two - user and multi - user schemes are described and analyzed in section [ two - user schemes ] and [ multi - user schemes ] , respectively .",
    "section [ numerical results ] presents the numerical results and section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "the basic setup for a cdr scheme is the scenario with one base station ( ` bs ` ) , one relay ( ` rs ` ) , and two users 1 and 2 ( ` ms1 ` and ` ms2 ` ) , see fig .",

    "all transmissions have a unit power and normalized bandwidth of 1 hz .",
    "each of the complex channels @xmath1 , is reciprocal , known at the receiver and rayleigh  faded with parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we use the following notation , with a slight abuse : @xmath3 may denote a packet or a single symbol , and it will be clear from the context . for example , the packet that ` bs ` wants to send to the ` ms1 ` is denoted by @xmath4 ; but if we want to express the signal received , then we use expressions of type @xmath5 , where all variables denote symbols ( received , sent , or noise ) . we introduce further notation : @xmath6 is the packet sent from ` bs ` to ` ms2 ` , while the packets that ` bs ` needs to receive are @xmath7 from ` ms1 ` and @xmath8 from ` ms2 ` . note that the example on fig .",
    "[ ref1p1 ] does not show traffic patterns that involve @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "the basic time unit is one time slot .",
    "a direct transmission takes one slot .",
    "one transmission through the relay takes also one slot : in the downlink , the first half of the slot is for the transmission ` bs - rs ` , while the second slot is is for the transmission ` rs - ms ` .",
    "the uplink transmission is similar . relaying with",
    "amplify  and  forward ( af ) is used , and therefore the transmission ` bs - rs ` has the same duration with the transmission ` rs - ms ` ( and vice versa in the uplink ) .",
    "the received signal and additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at ` bs ` , ` rs ` , ` ms1 ` and ` ms2 ` in time slot @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the @xmath12th channel is @xmath13 and its capacity is denoted as @xmath14 .",

    ", the received signal is scaled to comply with transmit constraint .    in the scenarios with more than two users , where scheduling also needs to be applied ,",
    "there are @xmath15 relayed users and @xmath15 direct users .",

    "direct users 1 , 4 , 5 request a downlink , direct users 2 , 3 request an uplink , relayed users 6 , 7 , 9 request a downlink and relayed users 8 , 10 request an uplink .",
    "one session consists of multiple _ frames _ , each frame consists of two slots in which a cdr transmission is performed .",
    "we slightly abuse the notation for the wireless channels by not explicitly indexing the channel with the particular user : @xmath1 thus refers to a channel in the set currently considered for a certain coordination .",
