    "the _ iras _",
    "mission first uncovered the presence of infrared luminous galaxies in the local universe ( neugebauer et al .",
    "1984 ) , and the sub - mm / mm surveys with scuba and mambo have highlighted the importance of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , @xmath4 ) at high redshift ( e.g. , smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; bertoldi et al .",
    "studies of high - redshift ulirgs are important for our general understanding of galaxy evolution since they are responsible for a significant fraction of the total energy generated by all galaxies over the history of the universe ( e.g. , blain et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the recent spectroscopic studies of the sub - mm galaxy ( smg ) population show that the redshift distribution peaks at @xmath53 ( chapman et al . 2003b , 2004 ) , and that the population is comprised of starbursts , agn , and composite agn+starburst systems ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; frayer et al . 2003 ; knudsen , van der werf , & jaffe 2003 ) . even though many smgs show the presence of agn , the molecular co line emission ( frayer et al . 1998 , 1999",
    "; neri et al .",
    "2003 ) and x - ray data ( alexander et al . 2003 ) are consistent with the majority of the infrared emission for the population arising from star formation .",
    "the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips , rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) allows us to directly measure the infrared colors and constrain the fraction of infrared - warm agn dominated versus infrared - cool starburst dominated smgs .",
    "before the launch of _ spitzer _ , we identified potential smgs in the first look survey verification field ( flsv ) by selecting radio sources with faint optical counterparts , following previous successful selection techniques ( e.g. , cowie , barger , & kneib 2002 ; chapman et al .",
    "we used deep westerbork 1.4ghz radio data ( rms@xmath6jy , morganti et al . 2004 ) and deep optical noao @xmath7-band data ( @xmath8mag , fadda et al .",
    "2004a ) to derive a list of candidate sources for follow - up observations with scuba . in the spring of 2003",
    ", we observed 28 galaxies at the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) using the scuba two - bolometer photometry mode , achieving rms levels of 23mjy at 850@xmath0 m .",
    "the _ spitzer _ observations were taken as part of the extragalactic first look survey ( fls ) .",
    "the 28 galaxies in the sample are located within the 0.25 degree@xmath9 of the fls verification field ( flsv ) and were observed with both the infrared array camera ( irac , fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) and mips .",
    "the data presented here have effective integration times of 480s , 336s , 168s , and 34s for the irac bands and the mips 24 , 70 , and 160@xmath0 m arrays , respectively .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard ssc pipeline and were coadded and corrected offline as needed .",
    "the details of the data reduction will be described in future fls data papers ( irac : lacy et al .",
    "2004 ; mips-24@xmath0 m : fadda et al . 2004b ; mips-70,160@xmath0 m : frayer et al .",
    "we observed 28 westerbork radio sources with scuba and detected 7 smgs at s / n@xmath10 .",
    "fourteen sources were not detected at 850@xmath0 m , and the remaining 7 sources have marginal results , showing positive signals of 1.53@xmath11 ( column[4 ] , table  1 ) . the westerbork radio data have a resolution of @xmath12 which is well matched to the scuba data , but is not sufficient to obtain reliable counterparts in general for the optical and _ spitzer _ data .",
    "we used the higher resolution ( @xmath13 ) vla ( 1.4ghz ) data of the field ( condon et al .",
    "2003 ) to obtain more accurate radio positions .",
    "the resolution of the vla data is well matched to the mips-24 resolution of @xmath14 . although the vla data have lower s / n ( rms@xmath15jy ) , the westerbork sources were typically detected at @xmath16 in the vla image , providing radio positional errors of about 12@xmath17 .",
    "the offsets between radio and mips-24 positions are typically less than 2@xmath17 , consistent within the positional uncertainties of the radio data and the 1.52@xmath17 positional uncertainties of the mips-24 data set .",
    "based on the 24@xmath0 m counts in the fls field ( marleau et al .",
    "2004 ) , the probability of a chance coincidence within 2@xmath17 is only about 1% for 24@xmath0 m sources brighter than 100@xmath0jy .",
    "hence , confusion at 24@xmath0 m is not a significant issue for this study . after the identification of the mips-24 and r - band counterparts based on the radio positions ,",
    "the corresponding mips-24 and optical positions were used to identify the appropriate irac counterparts .",
    "four of the westerbork sources have multiple radio components at the resolution of the vla data ( 1 , 45 , 79 , 128 ) . source 1 is the brightest _",
    "spitzer _ source and is comprised of five components , all detected in the mips-24 , r- , and the irac - bands .",
    "the details of the source identification are provided in table  1 .",
    "figure  1 shows the mips-24 and irac-3.6 images for the 7 smgs detected at 850@xmath0 m with s / n@xmath10 .",
    "all 14 sources showing 850@xmath0 m emission above the @xmath18 level have 24@xmath0 m counterparts , although source 208 is only detected at about the 2.5@xmath19 level at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "the detection of 24@xmath0 m counterparts associated even with the marginal 850@xmath0 m sources gives credence to the reliability of the @xmath20 smg sources . in comparison for the 14 radio sources without scuba detections ,",
    "only half have 24@xmath0 m counterparts .",
    "the detection of 24@xmath0 m counterparts for this sample of radio - selected smgs is consistent with the high fraction of 24@xmath0 m counterparts found for the mambo and scuba sources in the lockman hole ( ivison et al .",
    "2004 ; egami et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "seven sources in the full sample do not have optical counterparts down to r@xmath21mag , and only three are not detected by irac .",
    "the only source without any optical or irac counterpart is source108 which is the brightest radio galaxy in the sample ( likely a radio - loud agn ) .",
    "two sources ( 199[@xmath22 & 150[@xmath23 ) in the sample have spectroscopic redshifts from the ongoing keck deimos redshift survey ( choi et al .",
    "the low redshift of @xmath24 for the 850@xmath0 m source199 implies a cool dust temperature of 20k assuming a temperature dependent sub - mm to radio redshift relationship ( blain 1999 ) .",
    "the mips 24@xmath0 m flux densities for the galaxies detected at 850@xmath0 m are consistent with expectations , assuming standard ulirg spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at the typical redshifts of @xmath53 found for the smg population ( chapman et al . 2003b ; 2004 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows a range of s24/s(1.4ghz ) flux density ratios for the population that may reflect a wide distribution of infrared colors .",
    "all of the galaxies showing 850@xmath0 m emission lie within the range of values expected for local ulirgs redshifted to @xmath34 .",
    "galaxies without 850@xmath0 m emission show a wider range of s24/s(1.4ghz ) flux density ratios . about half of the radio sources without detectable 850@xmath0 m emission have properties consistent with ulirgs , while the other half show excess radio emission compared to their 24@xmath0 m emission , consistent with different degrees of radio - loudness .",
    "mips 70@xmath0 m observations can constrain the infrared colors of the smgs . infrared - warm , agn dominated sources are expected to have flux density ratios of s70/s24@xmath25 , while starburst dominated , infrared - cool sources are expected to have ratios of s70/s24@xmath26 .",
    "we only detect two sources at 70@xmath0 m , both of which are cool in the infrared ( source1 : s70/s24@xmath27 and source47 : s70/s24@xmath28 ) . to derive an estimated average s70/s24 ratio for the smg population , we coadded the 70@xmath0 m data at the radio positions for the sources showing 850@xmath0 m emission .",
    "we find an upper - limit of s70@xmath29mjy ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this corresponds to an infrared color of s70/s24@xmath1 , leaving out the two sources with 70@xmath0 m detections .",
    "including the two 70@xmath0 m detections , the average ratio for the smg population is s70/s24@xmath31 , which is slightly lower than expected if the population is dominated by star - formation . taken at face - value , these results could suggest that many smgs are infrared - warm agn , contrary to previous conclusions that the population is dominated by star - formation .",
    "however , the lower than expected s70/s24 ratios may arise from strong 7.7@xmath0 m pah emission redshifted into the 24@xmath0 m band , given that the median redshift for the smg population is @xmath32 ( chapman et al . 2003b ; 2004 ) .",
    "the seds in the irac bands can be used to estimate redshifts from the rest - frame 1.6@xmath0 m peak expected for star - forming systems ( e.g. , egami et al .",
    "2004 ) and to help identify agn showing hot dust implied by their red irac colors ( e.g. , ivison et al .",
    "2004 ) . for sources showing a significant bump in the irac bands ,",
    "the implied redshifts are generally consistent ( column [ 11]&[12 ] , table 1 ) with the redshift estimates derived from the sub - mm to radio spectral index ( carilli & yun 1999 ; blain 1999 ) .",
    "the discrepant photometric redshifts for sources48&119 may indicate cool dust temperatures ( @xmath33k ) for these smgs .    of the sources with 850@xmath0 m emission and irac detections",
    ", only source47 shows a strong increase in flux density as a function of wavelength across the irac bands consistent with an agn .",
    "however , source47 also has the highest s70/s24 ratio in the sample ( s70/s24=26 ) , suggesting that it is likely an infrared - cool starburst that could be at @xmath34 and/or be highly reddened due to dust extinction .",
    "hence , irac colors are not always conclusive for determining the properties at longer infrared wavelengths .      a significant fraction of smgs is comprised of extremely red objects ( eros ) ( smail et al . 1999 ; frayer et al . 2004a ) . the ero definition of @xmath35 ( thompson et al .",
    "1999 ) corresponds to a flux density ratio of s3.6/s(r)@xmath36 . using this criterion",
    ", we identify 8 eros ( fig .",
    "3 ) . the 30% ( 8/27 )",
    "fraction of eros in this sample is larger than the 8% found for the total micro - jy radio population ( smail et al .",
    "2002 ) , presumably since the scuba targets in this sample were generally selected on the basis of being faint and red in the optical bands .",
    "figure  3 shows a wide range of irac colors for the smg population , and no correlation is observed between the irac colors and the @xmath37 $ ] colors .",
    "another interesting result is that most of the radio - selected eros without detectable 850@xmath0 m emission ( 6/7 ) are bright at 24@xmath0 m , indicating that these sources are infrared - bright galaxies ( likely high - redshift ulirgs ) below the current scuba detection limits .",
    "all of the radio - selected smgs in the sample have _ spitzer _ counterparts , showing a wide range of infrared colors consistent with ulirgs at @xmath34 .",
    "the combination of accurate radio positions and 24@xmath0 m detections is a powerful tool for the identification of smgs .",
    "more sensitive observations are required in the mips-70 and mips-160 bands to measure the infrared colors of the smg population .",
    "in addition , observations with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph are needed to determine the level at which pah emission contributes to the mips-24 flux densities and to help determine the agn fraction of the population . in general , _ spitzer _ selected ulirgs will be biased toward agn , except within specific redshift bins associated with the pah features which may be biased toward starbursts .",
    "we thank the staff at the jcmt and the _ spitzer _ science center for their support of these observations .",
    "this work is based in part on observations made with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
