    "in this work we study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the neumann problem for the laplace operator @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the unit outward normal to @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the outside normal derivative .",
    "the domain @xmath10 is a thin domain with a highly oscillating boundary which is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a function satisfying @xmath13 for some fixed positive constants @xmath14 , @xmath15 and such that oscillates as the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "we may think , for instance , that the function @xmath17 is of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 are piecewise @xmath20-functions defined on @xmath21 , @xmath22 is an @xmath3-periodic smooth function and @xmath23 , see figure 1 .",
    "this includes the case where the function @xmath12 is a purely periodic function , for instance , @xmath24 but also includes the case where the function @xmath17 is not periodic and the amplitude is modulated by a function . as a matter of fact , we will be able to treat more general cases , see hypothesis ( h ) below , but to stay the general ideas in the introduction we may consider the proptotype function @xmath18 .",
    "[ thin - domain ]    the existence and uniqueness of solutions for problem ( [ op0 ] ) for each @xmath25 is garanteed by lax - milgram theorem .",
    "we are interested here in analyzing the behavior of the solutions as @xmath16 , that is , as the domain gets thinner and thinner although with a high oscillating boundary .",
    "observe that the domain is thin since @xmath26 and its upper boundary oscillates due to the function @xmath27 , ( if @xmath28 and @xmath29 is not a constant function ) .",
    "since the domain @xmath30 is thin , `` approaching '' the line segment @xmath31 , it is reasonable to expect that the family of solutions @xmath32 will converge to a function of just one variable and that this function will satisfy an equation of the same type of ( [ op0 ] ) but in one dimension , say @xmath33 in @xmath34 with some boundary conditions , where @xmath3 is a second order elliptic operator in one dimension . as a matter of fact ,",
    "if the function @xmath35 is independent of @xmath36 , ( say @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) , that is , the thin domain does not present any oscillations whatsoever : @xmath39 the limit equation is given by    @xmath40    see for instance @xcite .",
    "observe that the geometry of the thin domain enters into the limit equation through the diffusion coefficient .",
    "moreover , if we consider @xmath41 and if we assume that @xmath42 w-@xmath43 and @xmath44 w-@xmath43 ( observe that @xmath45 a.e . and in general it is not true that @xmath46 ) , then the limit problem is @xmath47 see @xcite . observe that this case contains the previous one . if @xmath37 , then @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and we recover equation ( [ thin - domain - hale - raugel ] ) .",
    "in this work we are interested in addressing the case @xmath50 , that is @xmath51 , where none of the techniques used to solve the previous ones apply .",
    "observe that this situation is very resonant : the height of the domain , the amplitude of the oscillations at the boundary and the period of the oscillations are of the same order @xmath36 .",
    "moreover we are interested in addressing not only the purely periodic case , that is , the case where the function @xmath52 for some @xmath3-periodic smooth function @xmath53 but also the general case where the amplitude of the oscillation depend on @xmath54 in a continuous fashion , that is , in our prototype case , the situation where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are not piecewise constant , but piecewise continuous function .",
    "the purely periodic case can be addressed by somehow standard techniques in homogenization theory , as developed in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an @xmath3-periodic @xmath57 function and if we denote by @xmath58 then the limit equation is shown to be @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the unique solution of @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the lateral boundary , @xmath64 is the upper boundary and @xmath65 is the lower boundary of @xmath66 , that is @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 we refer to @xcite for a complete analysis of the purely periodic case of a nonlinear parabolic problem .",
    "if we want to analyze now the case where the function @xmath17 is given by @xmath70 and the functions @xmath55 , @xmath56 are smooth but not necessarily constant , it is intuitively true that the limiting equation should behave like ( [ glp ] ) with a diffusion coefficient @xmath71 depending on @xmath54 somehow .",
    "actually if we look at the thin domain in a small neighborhood of a point @xmath72 , we will approximately see a domain with very high oscillations but locally the domain behaves like the thin domain with the function @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , it is expected that if we freeze the coefficients of the limit equation in a fixed point @xmath72 we should recover equation ( [ glp ] ) .",
    "although this intuitive argument will turn out to be true , it does not give us a complete information about the limit equation , specially , the way in which the dependence on @xmath54 is explicitly stated in the limit equation .",
    "for instance , it is not clear at this stage whether the limit equation should be @xmath74 or @xmath75 with @xmath76 or maybe @xmath77 where @xmath78 or maybe other .",
    "observe that all these equations coincide if we consider the purely periodic case .    in order to accomplish our goal and obtain the limit equation in the general case",
    ", we propose a technique that consists in solving first the piecewise periodic case , that is , the case where the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 are piecewise constant and then do an approximation argument to obtain the limit equation in the general case .",
    "this is a subtle argument since we are approximating first the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 by piecewise constant functions , say @xmath81 , @xmath82 so that @xmath83 and obtain the limit equation for @xmath84 fixed , passing to the limit as @xmath16 .",
    "then , in this limit equation , which will depend on @xmath85 , we pass to the limit as @xmath86 . but",
    "the limit we are interested in is taking first @xmath86 for @xmath25 fixed , so we obtain the domain given by the function @xmath87 , and then we pass to the limit as @xmath16 .",
    "but , a priori there is no garantee that these two limits commute .",
    "we will actually show that these two limits commute by proving that the solutions of problem ( [ op0 ] ) in two domains @xmath88 and @xmath89 , are close in the @xmath90 norm uniformly in @xmath36 when @xmath91 and @xmath92 are close .",
    "this result , which can be regarded as a domain perturbation result but uniformly in @xmath36 , guarantee that the two limits commute and will show that the limit problem is given as above .",
    "we remark that this domain perturbation result is not deduced from standard and known results on domain perturbation techniques since we are able to compare the solutions of an elliptic problem in two families of domains which also depend on a parameter and the way this domains depend on @xmath36 is not smooth at all .",
    "we strongly believe that this technique of solving first the piecewise periodic case and then use an approximation argument , _ uniform in the parameter @xmath4 _ , can be used in other problems to obtain the appropriate homogenized limit for the non periodic case .    following this agenda ,",
    "we solve first the piecewise periodic case , that is , the case where the function @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 are piecewise constant .",
    "we consider the points @xmath96 and assume that the functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 are constant in each of the interval @xmath97 , say @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "we show that the limit equation is of the same form ( [ glp ] ) in each of the intervals @xmath97 , that is , @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the unique solution of ( [ auxi ] ) in the cell @xmath103 where @xmath104 moreover , equation ( [ glp - piecewise ] ) is suplemented with neumann boundary conditions at @xmath105 , @xmath106 and with some `` matching '' condition at the points @xmath107 , @xmath108 , which are continuity of the function and some kind of kirchoff type conditions , see section [ piecewise - periodic ] for details . actually ,",
    "if we look at the variational formulation of the limit equation , we obtain @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 in @xmath97 .",
    "now we will be able to pass to the limit in this equation as @xmath112 and obtain the limit problem :    @xmath113    where @xmath114 @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the unique solution of ( [ auxi ] ) in the basic cell @xmath117 which depends on the variable @xmath54 and it is given by @xmath118 equation ( [ glp - cont ] ) is the limit equation we were looking for .    finally , we would like to remark that although we will treat the neumann boundary condition problem , we may also impose different conditions in the lateral boundaries of the thin domain @xmath30 , while preserving the neumann type boundary condition in the upper and lower boundary .",
    "that is for problem ( [ op0 ] ) we may consider conditions of the dirichlet type , @xmath119 , or even robin , @xmath120 in the lateral boundaries @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "the limit problem will preserve this boundary condition .",
    "that is , in problem ( [ glp - cont ] ) we will obtain the conditions @xmath123 or @xmath124 at @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we describe the contents of the paper . in section [ pre ]",
    "we set up the notation , obtain some technical results that will be needed in the proofs and state the main result . in section [ piecewise - periodic ] we obtain the result for the piecewise periodic case . in section [ bs ] we show the continuous dependence result on the domain , uniform in @xmath4 , that will be the key argument to obtain the limit problem . in section [ general - case ] we provide a proof of the main result .",
    "finally , we include an appendix where we analyze the behavior of the basic function @xmath61 solution of ( [ auxi ] ) as we perturb @xmath53 .    * acknowledgments . * part of this work was done while the second author was visiting the applied math department at complutense university in madrid .",
    "he express his kind gratitude to the department .",
    "we would also like to thank e. zuazua , c. castro , m. eugenia prez , m. lobo and d. gmez for the all the discussion and good suggestions on this problem .",
    "we consider the one parameter family of functions @xmath125 , where @xmath126 , @xmath127 for some @xmath128",
    ". we will assume the following hipothesis    * there exist two positive constants @xmath14 , @xmath15 such that @xmath129 moreover , the functions @xmath12 are of the type @xmath130 , where the function @xmath131 is @xmath3-periodic in the second variable , that is , @xmath132 and piecewise @xmath57 with respect to the first variable , that is , there exists a finite number of points @xmath133 such that the function @xmath134 is @xmath57 and such that @xmath53 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 are uniformly bounded in @xmath137 and have limits when we approach @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "one important example of a function satisfying the above conditions is @xmath140 where the functions @xmath55 , @xmath141, .. ,@xmath142 are piecewise @xmath57 in @xmath126 and the functions @xmath143, .. ,@xmath144 are all @xmath57 and @xmath3-periodic .",
    "we define the thin domain as @xmath145    in this work we study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the neumann problem for the laplace operator @xmath146 with @xmath6 and where @xmath7 is the unit outward normal to @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the outside normal derivative .    from lax - milgran theorem , we have that problem ( [ op ] ) has a unique solution for each @xmath147 .",
    "we are interested here in analyzing the behavior of the solutions as @xmath16 , that is , as the domain gets thinner and thinner although with a high oscillating boundary .",
    "to study the convergence of ( [ op ] ) in the thin oscillating domain @xmath10 , we consider the equivalent linear elliptic problem @xmath148 where @xmath149 satisfies @xmath150 for some @xmath151 independent of @xmath4 and now @xmath152 is the outward unit normal to @xmath153 and @xmath154 is given by @xmath155    observe that the equivalence between the problems ( [ op ] ) and ( [ p ] ) is obtained by changing the scale of the domain @xmath10 through the transformation @xmath156 , ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "moreover , the domain @xmath157 is not `` thin '' anymore but presents very wild oscillations at the top boundary , although the presence of a high diffusion coefficient in front of the derivative with respect the second variable balance the effect of the wild oscillations .",
    "the domain @xmath157 is related to the ones analyzed in the papers @xcite but the fact that in our case we have a very high diffusion in the @xmath2-direction makes our analysis and results different from these other papers .",
