    "random matrices with column / row constraints appear as the mathematical representations of complex systems in diverse areas e.g bosonic hamiltonians such as phonons , and spin - waves in heisenberg and xy ferromagnets , antiferromagnets , and spin - glasses , euclidean random matrices , random reactance networks , financial systems and internet related google matrix etc ( see section ii and references in @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore relevant to seek the information about their statistical behavior ; this not only helps to probe the related complex system but also in revealing the hidden connections among seemingly different complex systems .",
    "the standard route for the statistical analysis of a random matrix ensemble is based on its eigenvalues/ eigenfunctions fluctuations .",
    "this in turn requires a knowledge of the joint probability distribution function ( jpdf ) of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "an integration of jpdf over undesired variables then , in principle , leads to the fluctuation measures for the remaining variables ; for example , the spectral fluctuation measures can be obtained by an integration over all eigenfunctions .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the jpdf for the column / row constrained ensembles can be derived from the ensemble density but its further integration over eigenfunctions is not an easy task .",
    "this motivates us to seek , an alternative route i.e the numerical investigation of the ensembles ; our focus in this paper is on following objectives :    \\(i ) to understand the effect of randomness ( both type and strength ) and basis - connectivity on the fluctuation measures .",
    "\\(ii ) to analyze the size - dependence of the fluctuation measures ,    \\(iii ) search for the existence of any universal features in the statistical behavior .",
    "the motivation for the first objective comes from previous studies of the systems with goldstone symmetry ; the column constraints in the matrix representation of their operators originate from the invariance under a uniform shift @xcite . in absence of disorder ,",
    "the low frequency excitation in these systems have long wavelengths and are described by the equations of motion based on macroscopic properties .",
    "disorder causes local fluctuations in the properties but excitations are believed to couple only to their averages over a volume with linear dimensions set by a wavelength .",
    "consequently , higher dimensions , where averaging is more effective , are expected to be disorder - insensitive @xcite .",
    "but almost all these results are based on average behavior of the spectral density and inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) . as the statistical properties can in principle be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues / eigenfunctions fluctuations of the related operators , it is natural to query whether disorder has any , and if so , what impact on the fluctuations of the excitations , especially in higher dimensions . as mentioned in section 2 of @xcite ,",
    "the spectral statistics of the low lying bosonic excitations above a ground state @xmath0 is analogous to that of an ensemble of column constrained matrices with column constant @xmath1 ( for @xmath2 ) .",
    "the latter being statistically similar to the case @xmath3 ( except for a shift in the spectrum ) , the spectral information about goldstone modes can be obtained by an analysis of the @xmath3 ensemble . keeping this in view ,",
    "the present analysis is confined to the zero - column constraint ensembles .",
    "the modelling of complex systems by random matrix ensembles usually requires consideration of the infinite size limit .",
    "the numerical analysis however involves only finite size matrices . to translate the numerical information to real systems",
    ", it is necessary to analyze finite size effects which forms the basis of our 2nd objective .    the necessity for the third objective originates from our recent study @xcite of the jpdf of the column constrained ensembles ( cce ) for two different disorder types and basis - connectvities .",
    "our results indicated a mathematical analogy of their jpdf with that of a brownian ensemble ( be ) appearing between poisson and gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) ; this in turn implies a cce - be analogy for the local spectral fluctuation measures .",
    "the implication is seemingly in contrast to a previous study @xcite which predicts the analogy of the two point level - density correlation of cce to that of a goe .",
    "but , as explained in @xcite , the be - statistics in an energy range near @xmath4 is indeed of goe type ( see the discussion in 2nd paragraph after eq.(73 ) in @xcite ) and , therefore , our prediction agrees with @xcite near @xmath4 . for other energy ranges , a direct numerical comparison of their fluctuation measures",
    "is needed to reconfirm the cce - be analogy .",
    "( although a comparison of cce numerics with analytical be - results would have been more desirable but , due to technical complexity related to the orthogonal - space integration , available be - results are mostly asymptotic ) .    to fulfill the above objectives , here we numerically study cces for many system conditions .",
    "more specifically , we consider the gaussian and bimodal distributions of the off - diagonal matrix elements for many disorder strengths and system sizes ; the diagonals are obtained by invoking the column sum rule .",
    "the dimensionality in the matrices is taken into account by varying basis - connectivity i.e by choosing the matrix elements forming nearest - neighbor pairs non - zero and all others zero ( still subjected to column sum rule ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the ensemble densities for the cases considered in our numerical analysis ; these ensembles are special cases of those considered in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the spectral fluctuation measures requires a specific rescaling of the spectrum which in turn depends on whether the spectrum is ergodic or not ; this is discussed in section 2.a alongwith a numerical study of the ergodicity for cces , bes as well as goe ; the latter is included to illustrate the deviation of cces from goe .",
    "sections 2.b and 2.c present the numerical results for the average behavior and fluctuations , respectively , of cces with gaussian and bimodal distributed off - diagonals , both cases considered for infinite as well as finite basis - connectivity and many matrix sizes ; the objective of these sections is not only to verify the theoretical insight derived in @xcite but also to provide information about mathematically intractable fluctuation measures .",
    "the results of a numerical comparison of the cce - be fluctuations are given in section 3 which reconfirm our theoretical predictions of @xcite .",
    "section 4 concludes this study with a brief reviews of our main results and open questions .",
    "to investigate the sensitivity of the statistical fluctuations to the nature of randomness and basis - connectivity , we consider following cce ensembles of real - symmetric matrices @xmath5 with @xmath6 as their probability densities :    _ ( a ) independent off - diagonals with gaussian distribution ( infinite range or @xmath7 ccge case ) _ @xmath8 \\ ; \\prod_{l=1}^n \\delta \\left(\\sum_k   h_{kl } \\right ) \\label{rho2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this case corresponds to case ii of @xcite with @xmath9 .",

    "the symbol @xmath13 refers to a sum over all nearest - neighbors of a given site @xmath14 ( excluding @xmath15 site ) .",
    "this case corresponds to case iii of @xcite with @xmath16 .    _",
    "( c ) independent off - diagonals with bimodal distribution _ ( infinite range or @xmath7 ccbe case ) .",

    "we exactly diagonalize thousands of matrices of sizes @xmath21 using lapack subroutines ; by choosing an appropriate number of matrices , the statistical data size for each @xmath22 is ensured to be same .",
    "further , as clear from eqs.([rho2],[rho3],[birho1],[birho2 ] ) , the spectral statistics for these cases is independent of the off - diagonal variance ( a rescaling of the matrix elements by the variance leaves the statistics unaffected ) ; this is also confirmed by our numerics ( shown here for the level - density case in figure 1 ) . for fluctuations studies , the variance of non - zero off - diagonals in eqs.([rho2],[rho3 ] )",
    "is therefore kept fixed at @xmath23 .    prior to calculation of the fluctuation measures ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the ergodic as well as stationary aspects of the spectrum .",
    "the spectral density @xmath24 at a spectral scale @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 . under assumptions that @xmath27",
    "consists of two spectral scales , a slowly varying component @xmath28 , often referred as the secular behavior , and a rapidly varying component , @xmath29 , one can write @xmath30 ( also referred as the local random excitations of @xmath28 ) @xcite . a spectral averaging over a scale larger than that of the fluctuations gives @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ". previous studies of a wide range of complex systems indicate @xmath28 to be more system specific as compared to the fluctuations ; the latter reveal a great deal of universal features and often depend only on the global constraints of the system .",
    "the information about local fluctuations can therefore be better revealed by an `` unfolding '' the spectrum i.e removing its system - dependent part @xmath28 by a rescaling @xmath33 of the eigenvalues @xmath34 which results in uniform local mean spectral density @xcite .",
    "experimental studies often analyze the behavior of a single spectrum which leaves the unfolding by @xmath28 the only option .",
    "but theoretical modelling of a complex system by a random matrix ensemble is based on the assumptions of ergodicity of global and local properties .",
    "as discussed in section 2.2.3 of @xcite , the ergodicity of a global property such as the level density implies @xmath35 , with @xmath36 as the ensemble averaged level density , and one can use @xmath36 as a substitute for @xmath37 for various analytical purposes .",
    "it is therefore necessary to check the ergodicity of the level density which requires @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath39 implying an ensemble average for a fixed @xmath25 .",
    "a comparison of the ensemble and the spectral averaging for the spectral density of ccge , be as well as goe is shown in figure 1 ; here each case is considered for an ensemble of @xmath40 matrices of size @xmath41 . as seen from the figure 1(d ) , @xmath37 even for a single goe matrix almost coincides with @xmath42 as well as @xmath36 for all @xmath25 , reconfirming its ergodicity . for cgge and",
    "be , the @xmath25-dependence of the @xmath28 fluctuates ( weakly ) from one matrix to the other but the ensemble averaged @xmath37 does agree well with @xmath36 .",
    "although the figure 1 displays the result only for one system size , we find similar analogy for higher @xmath22 values too , with deviation from one matrix realization to other diminishing with higher @xmath22 .",
    "this indicates an approach to ergodicity for the level density in large @xmath22 limit .",
    "an ergodic level density however does not by itself implies the ergodicity of the local density fluctuations .",
    "as discussed in section 2.2.3 of @xcite , the ergodicity of a local property say `` @xmath43 '' can be defined as follows : let @xmath44 be the distribution function of @xmath43 in the region `` @xmath25 '' over the ensemble and @xmath45 be the distribution function of @xmath43 over a single realization , say `` @xmath14 '' of the ensemble .",
    "@xmath43 is called ergodic if it satisfies the following conditions : ( i ) @xmath44 is stationary i.e @xmath46 for arbitrary @xmath47 , ( ii ) for almost all @xmath14 , @xmath45 is independent of @xmath14 i.e @xmath48 , ( iii ) @xmath49 .",
    "however if condition ( i ) is not fulfilled , @xmath43 is then referred as locally ergodic .",
    "more clearly , an ensemble is locally ergodic in a spectral range say @xmath50 around @xmath25 , if the averages of its local properties over the range for a single matrix ( referred as the spectral average ) are same as the averages over the ensemble at a fixed @xmath25 ( referred as the ensemble average ) . to analyze the ergodicity of local spectral fluctuations",
    ", we consider a standard measure , often used for this purpose , namely , _ the width @xmath51 of the distribution @xmath52 of the eigenvalue spacings @xmath53 between @xmath54 neighbors ( @xmath55 ) within a range @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 as the mean spacing _",
    "@xcite ; ( note the mean of the distribution is @xmath59 ) .",
    "figure 2 compares the ensemble averaged @xmath60 with the spectral average for ccge , be and goe , separately for each case ( using eq.(35 ) and eq.(39 ) of @xcite for the spectral and the ensemble average , respectively ) ) . as the figure indicates , contrary to goe , the local fluctuations in both ccge as well as be are non - ergodic and their unfolding with @xmath36 for finite @xmath22 cases is not appropriate ( as it may introduce spurious fluctuations ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary to determine the local spectral density @xmath28 either by theoretical , experimental or computational route .    as mentioned above",
    ", the stationarity is an important aspect which implies an invariance of the local fluctuation measures along the spectrum - axis .",
    "a non - stationary spectrum can at best be locally ergodic and therefore a complete information about the spectrum requires its analysis at various spectral ranges .",
    "figure 3 displays the behavior of an ensemble averaged @xmath61 for ccge , be and goe for many @xmath14-values and for a few spectral ranges taken from the region between edge and bulk .",
    "note , as already known @xcite , goe is also not exactly stationary and the edge statistics shows significant deviation from that of the bulk ( our numerics shown in figure 3(d ) reconfirms this behavior ) . as clear from the figure , the regions in which translational invariance holds for ccge and be are much smaller than in goe .",
    "the average spectral density @xmath28 is a standard measure for experimental or computational studies of many complex systems ( often based on single system analysis ) ; figures 4,5 depict @xmath28 behavior of a column constrained matrix , for two disorder types , namely , gaussian and bimodal , for various dimensions ( i.e basis connectivity ) and disorder strengths .",
    "the effect of dimensionality on the average behavior is clearly visible from these figures .",
    "as shown for the gaussian case in figure 4 , the dependence of @xmath28 on the disorder strength @xmath62 can be scaled out .",
    "the size @xmath22 has no effect on @xmath28 for short - range basis connectivity ( nearest - neighbor hopping cases with low - dimensionality @xmath63 ) , for both type of disorders ( ensemble([rho3],[birho2 ] ) ) .",
    "the numerics for different @xmath22 for the long - range basis - connectivity ( ensemble ( [ rho2],[birho1 ] ) ) , displayed in figure 5(c ) , however indicates following @xmath22-dependence @xmath64 . a comparison shown in figure 12(a ) suggests the bulk behavior of the function @xmath43 as semicircle : @xmath65 with @xmath66 a constant . an important point to note from figure 5(c )",
    "is the same @xmath22 dependence of @xmath28 in both edge and bulk ; the critical be with @xmath67 is expected to model the @xmath7 cce - statistics in both energy regimes ( see section v.b of @xcite for the details ) .",
    "furthermore the edge - behavior seems to be in agreement with the level - density of goldstone modes in spin - glasses for @xmath68 : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath7 .",

    "for clarity of presentation , the behavior for @xmath36 and @xmath78 are not included in figures 4,5 but , based on figure 1 , their dependence on disorder and system - size is expected to be same as that of @xmath28 .    as discussed in @xcite , a typical eigenvector of a real - symmetric column constrained",
    "matrix displays a new characteristic : it is the lack of single basis - state localization ( the minimum number of basis - states required for localization is two ) which is in constrast with an unconstrained real - symmetric matrix .",
    "this tendency can be better analyzed by a numerical study of the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) @xmath79 , the standard tool to describe the localization behavior of an eigenfunction .",
    "it is defined as @xmath80 for an eigenfunction @xmath81 with @xmath82 as its components in a @xmath22-dimensional basis .",
    "the minimum number of basis - states available for localization restricts the maximum ipr @xmath83 with @xmath84 or @xmath85 for a typical eigenvector of a matrix with or without column constraints , respectively @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from figure 6 , the maximum ipr indeed does not go above 0.5 , except in figure 6(f ) where it reaches 0.6 ; the latter seems to be an edge effect .",
    "the localization length in general fluctuates from one eigenfunction to the other .",
    "the average localization behavior of the eigenfunctions within a given spectral range can be given by a spectral averaged @xmath86 ( i.e average of ipr of all eigenfunctions within the range ) @xcite . in case of an ensemble , it is useful to consider the ensemble as well as spectral averaged @xmath86 , later referred simply as @xmath87 . figure 6 indicates the existence of a scale - invariance of @xmath87 with respect to off - diagonal variance and therefore degree of disorder for both types . as clear from the insets in figure 6 ,",
    "the localization tendency for the low lying eigenfunctions ( lower energy excitations ) for the gaussian and bimodal types is just the reverse for short - range basis connectivity but similar for the long range .",
    "the fits in the insets for each case suggest @xmath88 for @xmath75 , @xmath89 for @xmath68 for small-@xmath90 .",

    "our next step is to probe the local fluctuations around the spectral density for two disorder - types and for different connectivity in the lattice .",
    "as discussed above , @xmath37 for cce is @xmath25-dependent and a comparison of local fluctuations from two different spectral regions with different @xmath37 requires an unfolding of the spectrum . in past ,",
    "many ways for unfolding have been suggested e.g. polynomial unfolding ( approximating the empirical staircase function by a polynomial ) @xcite , gaussian unfolding ( gaussian smoothing of each delta peak in @xmath27 ) @xcite , fourier unfolding ( removal of short scale wavelengths using fourier transformation ) or local unfolding ( local mean level density assumed to be constant within a narrow spectral - window ) @xcite , detrending the fluctuations @xcite etc .",
    "previous studies of many systems indicate the statistics in the low - density regions e.g. edge to be sensitive to the procedure used but that in the bulk is unaffected .",
    "although gaussian unfolding is often believed to be suitable in the edge region , the results are sensitive to width of the gaussian smoothing @xcite .",
    "our numerical experiment with various unfoldings encourages us to apply the local unfolding @xcite : we first determine the smoothed level density @xmath28 for each spectra by a histogram technique , and then integrate it numerically to obtain the unfolded eigenvalues @xmath96 .",
    "( note , this is similar to the gaussian unfolding except now the smoothing of @xmath97-functions is done ove the bins of fixed size ) .",
    "testing of this unfolding procedure for two fluctuation measure of a goe , namely , the nearest neighbor spacing distribution and the number variance gives results consistent with the goe - theory , for both bulk as well as in the edge regime .",
    "note , due to spurious fluctuations introduced by finite size - effects , all the unfoldings mentioned above are unreliable for large spectral length - scales . more clearly , the numerical calculation of the short - range fluctuation measure is robust across different unfolding procedures but long - range measure are sensitive to the type of unfolding used .",
    "only way to distinguish the `` true '' fluctuations ( those present in @xmath98 limit ) from the spurious ones is to analyze the statistics for many system - sizes and study the emergent behavior in large size limit @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations being in general sensitive to the spectral - range ( due to non - stationarity of the spectrum ) , it is necessary to choose an optimized range @xmath99 which is sufficiently large for good statistics but keeps mixing of different statistics at minimum .",
    "we analyze 2 - 5@xmath100 of the total eigenvalues taken from a range @xmath99 , centered at the energy - scale of interest ( edge or bulk ) .",
    "this gives approximately @xmath101 eigenvalues and their eigenfunctions for each ensemble .",
    "( note due to almost constant level density in the bulk , the statistics is locally stationary and one can take levels within larger energy ranges without mixing the statistics . a rapid variation of @xmath28 in the edge however allows one to consider levels only within very small spectral ranges . for edge - bulk comparisons ,",
    "it is preferable to choose same number of levels for both spectral regimes ) .",
    "the standard tools for the fluctuations analysis , both experimentally as well as numerically , are the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath102 and the number - variance @xmath103 , the measures for the short and long - range spectral correlations , respectively @xcite .",
    "these can be defined as follows : _",
    "@xmath102 ( same as @xmath104 defined in section ii.a ) is the probability of two nearest neighbor eigenvalues to occur at a distance @xmath105 , measured in the units of local mean level spacing @xmath58 _ , and , _",
